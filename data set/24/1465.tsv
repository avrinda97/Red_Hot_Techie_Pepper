2010-01-03T17:04:00.000Z	ecart		how to make the menu transparent?
2010-01-03T17:05:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	If you have desktop effects enabled, it's easy
2010-01-03T17:07:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	my video card is 32mb onboard. already managed to leave the terminal over the menu items do not.
2010-01-03T17:08:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	I didn't understand what you said
2010-01-03T17:11:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	is to make the menu transparent? The terminal already done and the bars, less the menu
2010-01-03T17:11:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	What window manager are you using?
2010-01-03T17:14:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	I am new to linux I would like to teach me how to
2010-01-03T17:15:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	Well, what desktop environment are you using; ie. gnome, kde, xfce,etc
2010-01-03T17:15:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	you have some step by step how to do?
2010-01-03T17:16:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	So it is likely your window manager is either metacity or compiz. Bring up a terminal and look at the output of 'ps ax|egrep "compiz|metacity"|grep -v grep'
2010-01-03T17:20:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	$ ps xa | egrep
2010-01-03T17:21:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	you missed the rest of the command
2010-01-03T17:21:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	Look at the output (between the 'tick marks') of 'ps ax|egrep "compiz|metacity"|grep -v grep'
2010-01-03T17:23:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	hitler@Berlin:~$ ps ax|egrep "compiz|metacity"|grep -v grep
2010-01-03T17:24:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	There you go, so you're using metacity. If you want more effects you should use compiz. Which video card do you have as reported by the output of 'lspci|grep VGA'?
2010-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	sis mirage grafic 32mb onboard
2010-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	Ah well you can't use compiz then
2010-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	With metacity, you can have transparent window borders and even real terminal transparency, but not drop down menu transparency afaik
2010-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	The good news is you can get a video card capable of running compiz for $10USD if that is an option fro you
2010-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	Any nvidia or ati card made in this century should be able to run compiz :)
2010-01-03T17:29:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	v
2010-01-03T17:29:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	On ebay? or anywhere on the internet probably
2010-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	ecart	soreau	ebay is fraud; /
2010-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	soreau	ecart	Yes, you must be carefully when making any internet based purchase
