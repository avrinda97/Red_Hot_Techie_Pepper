2010-02-04T09:20:00.000Z	sacarlson		How can I get mysql to install on Ubuntu 9.1?  I tried 5.0 and 5.1 both got stuck in install.  When I tried to unistall I also had problems.  I now have them deleted.  what should I do to install a working mysql?
2010-02-04T09:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	where did you try to install them from?
2010-02-04T09:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	I used synaptic
2010-02-04T09:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	can you define "got stuck"?
2010-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	well I didn't write it down but I can try again and tell you.
2010-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	should I just try install lamp?
2010-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	sure.  My guess is that you didn't expand the little window that asks you for sql root password.
2010-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	from tasksel?  You could, if you want it.
2010-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	no I got that far
2010-02-04T09:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	huh, that's odd.  Maybe you should try from the command line so you can see any error messages that crop up.
2010-02-04T09:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	I also tried tasksel but now I have a clean start so I'll try tasksel again
2010-02-04T09:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	yes this time i'm using the command line with tasksel
2010-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	after running tasksel and selecting lamp-server I saw no errors and looks like mysql is installed when I checked in synaptic but I see no demon running
2010-02-04T09:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	what happens if you start it manually?  'sudo service mysqld start'
2010-02-04T09:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	unrecognized service
2010-02-04T09:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	try mysql instead of mysqld - I can't remember
2010-02-04T09:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	when I deleted it I also deleted the files with mysql in /etc/init.d  maybe those were still needed?
2010-02-04T09:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	uh, apt should have replaced them when you reinstalled
2010-02-04T09:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	nothing with the word  ls /etc/init.d/*my*  nothing there
2010-02-04T09:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	did you install the mysql server or just the client?
2010-02-04T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	I installed lamp
2010-02-04T09:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sacarlson	well, something's still messed up from before.  Try doing an install --reinstall of the server package
2010-02-04T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	I just ran mysqld-safe and that brings up something
2010-02-04T09:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	tonyyarusso	now I see a mysqld running
