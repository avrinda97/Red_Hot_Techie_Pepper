2004-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	Riff		these icons better end upstream
2004-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	i just nicked the netapplet ones for now
2004-09-11T14:26:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	but decided not to use those anyway
2004-09-11T14:44:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	what does it do for machines that don't have batteries?
2004-09-14T10:18:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	let me know what you think about the battstat/wifi icons
2004-09-14T10:19:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I haven't seen them yet, are they going upstream?
2004-09-14T10:21:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	if they don't suck
2004-09-14T10:22:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I haven't used updated ubuntu yet, so I haven't seen them
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I want to see gnome 2.10 with HAL for gnome-vfs
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	well, 2.8 has support for it, but i'm not entirely confident is stable :)
2004-09-14T10:25:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I'm using it at the moment
2004-09-14T10:25:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	see that image?
2004-09-14T10:26:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	the images seem cool
2004-09-14T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	yeah
2004-09-14T10:28:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	so it's not as "insanely" cool as I'd thought
2004-09-14T10:30:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	not really, gnome-vfs (and thus gnome-vfs-daemon) can be used in non-gnome apps
2004-09-14T10:30:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	excellent point
2004-09-14T10:33:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	gconfd does a lot of caching and deals with policy shit
2004-09-14T10:34:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	how would you do multiple session caching?
2004-09-15T11:46:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	i've just ordered a dell x300
2004-09-15T11:46:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I dislike Dell immensely due to my bad experiences with them, as a result I haven't looked at their product range
2004-09-18T15:27:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	you are obsessed with ISDN
2004-09-25T06:59:00.000Z	jdub	Riff	no, no howl
2004-09-25T06:59:00.000Z	Riff	jdub	I can't compile it
