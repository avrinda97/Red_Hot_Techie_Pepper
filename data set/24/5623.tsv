2007-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		you can manually create partitions and chose a number of file systems to use
2007-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		and format in the fs of your choice
2007-01-19T07:32:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		I don't know if the Ubuntu installer has a verbose option for partitioning.
2007-01-19T07:33:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		Does anyone know what FS Ubuntu 6.10 uses by default?
2007-01-19T07:33:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	ext3
2007-01-19T07:33:00.000Z	NeoGeo64	brianski	why not ext4? it just came out
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	uh, you just answered your own quesgtion
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		no i mean it just came out
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		they said its stable
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	are you being serious?
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		and its been added to the kernel
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		yes
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	brianski		if you want the bleeding edge, run another distro
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		i read it on slashdot
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	first, how would a system that was released in october default to a filesystem that was released today
2007-01-19T07:35:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	second, why would you want to use that format until it's been battle tested?
2007-01-19T07:35:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4
2007-01-19T07:35:00.000Z	brianski	NeoGeo64	yes, and?
2007-01-19T07:35:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		u asked if i was joking
2007-01-19T07:35:00.000Z	NeoGeo64		so i gave a link
2007-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	brianski		hot damn
2007-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	brianski		i meant are you joking that a beta filesystem would be made the default on an os that was released before it was even announced
2007-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	brianski		but i guess that was lost on you.
2007-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	NeoGeo64	brianski	thats not an excuse
