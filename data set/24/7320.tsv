2005-02-10T09:25:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		Couldn't find package alsa-conf
2005-02-10T09:26:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		whoops
2005-02-10T09:26:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		says it's installed :S

2005-02-10T09:29:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		The laptop is a few months old actually. Ubuntu is the first system to get this much working. Only thing I'm having a problem with is sound.
2005-02-10T09:30:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		What's that supposed to do?
2005-02-10T09:30:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		it let me do updatedb now
2005-02-10T09:30:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	Ubuntu removed alsaconf, because it's largely useless.
2005-02-10T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	what sound chipset are you using?
2005-02-10T09:32:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO	crimsun	- Analog Devices AC '97 SoundMAX Codec
2005-02-10T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	lsmod|grep ^snd_intel8x0
2005-02-10T09:34:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	blacklist the modem module: echo snd-intel8x0m | sudo tee -a /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-02-10T09:35:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	when you next boot, sound should work.
2005-02-10T09:40:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	are the channels unmuted?
2005-02-10T09:41:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	in a terminal, execute: alsamixer
2005-02-10T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	does /proc/asound/cards list your chipset?
2005-02-10T09:45:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO	crimsun	been a while since I've done anything in linux. How do I check from the terminal?
2005-02-10T09:45:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	in a terminal, type: cat /proc/asound/cards
2005-02-10T09:47:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	aplay -Dplughw:0 some.wav
2005-02-10T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	use gedit
2005-02-10T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	ChaosZ3RO	unless you meant from the command line, in which case you'd use $EDITOR
