2005-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	david_m_e		grrr.... i feel stupid... how do i find all files on a Linux file system matching a particular wildcard? i am trying to find out if <stdio.c> is part of any of the development tools included in the base distrib of Ubuntu, but "ls *.c" only gives me files in root; "ls /*/*.c" only gives me files one dir down, etc... how do i search for a file anywhere on the file system?
2005-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	david_m_e		hail czr!
2005-12-17T17:26:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	^
2005-12-17T17:26:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	'locate stdio.h' will search a daily-updated db for files on disk, too (-r lets you use a regexp)
2005-12-17T17:26:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	apt-file and packages.ubuntu.com let you search for files in packages you may not have installed yet
2005-12-17T17:27:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	stdio.h is in libc6-dev, but you need build-essential if you want to install anything
2005-12-17T17:30:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	how good a C++ programmer are you?
2005-12-17T17:30:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	more like novice
2005-12-17T17:31:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	in the sense that you as a skilled C++ would spank you as a newbie python one
2005-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	go to the keybindings dialog and bind winkey to the gnome menu
2005-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	thanks
2005-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	text selection is toolkit and app-specific, but shift-left/right works fine for me in firefox at least
2005-12-17T17:38:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	what is "gui mode"?
2005-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	good question; i wanted to find out myself; it sounded nice
2005-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	gcc has nothing to do with guis at all
2005-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	ah, gvim
2005-12-17T17:40:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	gvim: command not found
2005-12-17T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	dpkg -l build-essential | tail -n1
2005-12-17T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	remember printf for C++ is in cstdio, tho
2005-12-17T06:46:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	that may be the problem
2005-12-17T06:48:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	time to show us the code and the command line oyu ran, in #flood
2005-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	it checks on boot to see if you have software raid it should be dealing with
2005-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	bob2	david_m_e	it does nothing if you don't have any
2005-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	david_m_e	bob2	Seveas thanks
