2007-12-09T21:12:00.000Z	Roman123		Hi! I'm trying to install XEN following  http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu-7.10-server-install-xen-from-ubuntu-repositories-p2 But in the debootstrap step the command xen-create-image dies. Any Xen expert here who knows this problem?
2007-12-09T21:13:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	you should pastebin the output, or tell us what the error was when it died
2007-12-09T21:14:00.000Z	Roman123		it is a kernel oops :(
2007-12-09T21:14:00.000Z	Roman123		there is a posting at ubuntuforums but without a replay :(
2007-12-09T21:15:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	well then link to it, otherwise it will be tough to get help since you don't mention the actual error in your question
2007-12-09T21:18:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	one moment. I'm trying to find the logfile entries
2007-12-09T21:24:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	It starts with BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00100100
2007-12-09T21:24:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	I would pastebin the whole output, it will definitly help debugging
2007-12-09T21:25:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	done
2007-12-09T21:25:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	url?

2007-12-09T21:26:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	what error did the xen-create-disk-image (or whatever it is) display?
2007-12-09T21:27:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	none
2007-12-09T21:27:00.000Z	Roman123		the system crashes
2007-12-09T21:27:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	what command did you run? (with arguments etc)
2007-12-09T21:27:00.000Z	Roman123		xen-create-image --hostname=starmaclinux1.sinh.us --size=20Gb --swap=256Mb --ip=192.168.1.21 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=192.168.1.1 --force --dir=/home/xen --memory=256Mb --arch=i386 --kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-xen --initrd=/boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-xen --debootstrap --dist=etch --passwd
2007-12-09T21:30:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	any ideas?
2007-12-09T21:30:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	just goes to ask a side question, any reason you're install etch instead of gutsy?, but besides that I would try making sure the /home/xen dir is there, other then that I have no idea, it's wierd that you get a kernel panic. You can always install without the xen create image, there are tuts online that walk you through creating the xen config by hand
2007-12-09T21:31:00.000Z	Roman123	kelsin	I want a simple debian based host. But I can try gutsy
2007-12-09T21:31:00.000Z	Roman123		thanks
2007-12-09T21:31:00.000Z	Roman123		I'll try later
2007-12-09T21:31:00.000Z	Roman123		brb
2007-12-09T21:31:00.000Z	kelsin	Roman123	yeah I would drop xen-create-image and do it by hand, debootstrap is a very simple command, let me see if I can find the guide I used
