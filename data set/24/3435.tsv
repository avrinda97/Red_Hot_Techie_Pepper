2008-01-31T03:36:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		Do I have much chance of customising a LiveCD inside a LiveCD with 2gb RAM?
2008-01-31T03:36:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		dual-booting?
2008-01-31T03:37:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd		'Cause I've partitioned my HDD to death and I want to run an OS from RAM
2008-01-31T03:37:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	that would require loading the OS into ram every time you boot
2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	which...would be slow
2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	it would also mean that you can't install any new programs...you can, but it will all be lost if you need to reboot
2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	that's what SSD's are for
2008-01-31T03:38:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	you can create a ramdisk if you really want to
2008-01-31T03:39:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	this is what SSDs are made for...you can get one large enough to hold your OS for not too much $$$
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd	nemilar	SSDs?
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd	nemilar	you snooze you lose?
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	Solid State Drives.
2008-01-31T03:40:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	they're basically flash memory that acts as a hard drive...the Next Big Thing
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	it's not quite as fast as RAM, but you don't loose all the data when your computer shuts down, or hibernates
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	it's flash-based, so it's much faster
2008-01-31T03:41:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	they last longer than conventional HDDs
2008-01-31T03:43:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	SSD != RAM drive
2008-01-31T03:44:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	/tmp is usually in RAM
2008-01-31T03:46:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	are you speaking of D-mn Small Linux?
2008-01-31T03:46:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	DSL isn't really for a desktop...it's very, very minimal
2008-01-31T03:47:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	it's used mostly as a rescue distro, with certain uses in small devices that don't need many programs
2008-01-31T03:48:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	DSL isn't for desktop use
2008-01-31T03:55:00.000Z	nemilar	Nihilist_Nerd	if you create it, it's automatically GPL'd
2008-01-31T03:55:00.000Z	Nihilist_Nerd	nemilar	okay, i'm not that familiarwith theasoftware licenses, but i'll take your word for it
