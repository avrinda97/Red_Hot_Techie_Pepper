2009-12-06T07:17:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	are the apps not playing at all, or are you having audio issues?
2009-12-06T07:19:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	which player? u have the medibuntu repository in ur apt?
2009-12-06T07:19:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	how do i get medibuntu
2009-12-06T07:21:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	use rhythmbox. if it's having problems (like codecs), you need to allow the download of codec driver
2009-12-06T07:22:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	yes thats the exact problem - how do dl codec
2009-12-06T07:22:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	no packages with the requested plugins found: mpeg-1 layer 3 mp3 decoder
2009-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	dude! medi-frikkin-buntu! add it to ur repository & update
2009-12-06T07:23:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	howwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
2009-12-06T07:24:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2009-12-06T07:25:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	if you go to www.medibuntu.org, click on "repository howto", it's all explained plain & simple
2009-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	it doen't matter; once you've added the medibuntu repository, it's loaded as needed
2009-12-06T07:27:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	have you actually done the effort of going to the site & following the guide?
2009-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	the problem is not the OS, but the dodgy codecs your media's encoded in
2009-12-06T07:29:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	oh yea, mp3 codecs are real dodgy
2009-12-06T07:31:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	dude! please pay attention! people are taking time to help you out. go to www.medibuntu.org, click on the howto-link & add & update your repository. it's 3 click & a copy & paste. if you're not willing to do something so simple, then give me root ssh admin to you box & we'll fix it FOR you
2009-12-06T07:31:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	i already told you five times that i did that and i keep asking "what's next" or rephrase it to "then whta?" and you obviously dont get that
2009-12-06T07:31:00.000Z	AnonYmous2	nakake	you DO NOT need to explicitly add codecs; the medibuntu allows it to be dome automatically. you've been told this a few times now
2009-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	nakake	AnonYmous2	then what?
