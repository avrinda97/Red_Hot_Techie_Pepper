2006-06-23T15:21:00.000Z	terrapen_		hi.  anybody seen a problem where screen(1) does not bind the backspace key correctly?
2006-06-23T15:22:00.000Z	terrapen_		I've never had this problem with screen(1) on any other platform.  Currently, I have to do Control-H to delete
2006-06-23T15:23:00.000Z	terrapen_		y'all must not use screen very often :)
2006-06-23T15:25:00.000Z	terrapen_		sure, you can delete .. :)
2006-06-23T15:25:00.000Z	terrapen_		but you will be deleting the directory under youself
2006-06-23T15:26:00.000Z	terrapen_		ok, i'll ask just one last time...does anybody here use screen(1) on ubuntu?
2006-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	yes.
2006-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	but you have to ask again.
2006-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	terrapen_	judah	how did you get your backspace key to work properly? :)
2006-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	well.. it just works.
2006-06-23T15:27:00.000Z	terrapen_	judah	bummer...mine does not
2006-06-23T15:28:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	check to make sure you're using the correct keyboard map
2006-06-23T15:28:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	also do you have the TERM environment variable set?
2006-06-23T15:29:00.000Z	terrapen_	judah	yup... xterm-color
2006-06-23T15:29:00.000Z	terrapen_		same as i've had it set for years
2006-06-23T15:29:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	try to set it to xterm
2006-06-23T15:30:00.000Z	judah		i get Wuff ------ Wuff !!!  when it's set to xterm-color
2006-06-23T15:30:00.000Z	terrapen_		ahh
2006-06-23T15:30:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	however.. you can use ctl + u to clear a whole line if you're stuck .
2006-06-23T15:30:00.000Z	terrapen_		indeed that fixes it...yup, know about ctrl-u
2006-06-23T15:31:00.000Z	terrapen_		ok, that's probably a flaw in ubuntu's termcaprc
2006-06-23T15:31:00.000Z	judah	terrapen_	and ctl + h to single backspace
2006-06-23T15:31:00.000Z	terrapen_		err termcap
2006-06-23T15:31:00.000Z	terrapen_	judah	of course
