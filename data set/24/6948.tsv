2005-06-05T11:47:00.000Z	bob2		it's trivial
2005-06-05T11:47:00.000Z	bob2		and already done
2005-06-05T11:47:00.000Z	bob2		gdmflexiserver does that
2005-06-05T11:48:00.000Z	bob2		there's just no useful UI for it
2005-06-05T11:48:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	but how can i set the gdm to spawn the new login on a different xserver, as well as make sure that when the screen goes to screen saver, it reverts to gdm?
2005-06-05T11:48:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	I don't know
2005-06-05T11:48:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	 can i, right now, implement this or not?
2005-06-05T11:48:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	of course
2005-06-05T11:49:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	could there be any consideration to using gperfection icon theme in ubuntu soon?
2005-06-05T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	"dramatically better" is of course subjective.  it could be proposed if it's Free and everything
2005-06-05T11:51:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	screenshot url?
2005-06-05T11:51:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	one sec
2005-06-05T11:52:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	notice how it doesn't look all shiny like plastik, but still looks more modern?
2005-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	what do you think?
2005-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	the folder icon is a bit lame
2005-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	very gnome 1.4-y
2005-06-05T11:56:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	what on earth are you talking about?!  it's the SAME FOLDER icon as in gnome currently, just slicker around the edges.
2005-06-05T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	meh, I think the current icon theme in gnome isn't all that hot either
2005-06-05T11:58:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	well, gperfection is like gnome but way more modern looking.  i challenge you to find a theme with a better looking directory icon.
2005-06-05T12:05:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	it's in hoary and has been for months
2005-06-05T12:05:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	apt-cache search openoffic
2005-06-05T12:05:00.000Z	BR0KEN	bob2	whenever i do an apt-get dist-upgrade it never has upgraded.
2005-06-05T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	er, of course, it's not the default since it's buggy and brand new
2005-06-05T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	BR0KEN	you need to install it if you want it
