2007-05-22T16:44:00.000Z	wastedfluid		Pelo; that synaptics guide isn't my problem.. I just looked..
2007-05-22T16:45:00.000Z	wastedfluid		I'm having the problem as to trying to "move" your cursor w/ the touchpad will click.. it will paste.. drag... and it's making it really hard to use the touchpad at all.
2007-05-22T16:45:00.000Z	wastedfluid		Okay, thanks Pelo.
2007-05-22T16:47:00.000Z	wastedfluid		Pelo; I understand.  I've been looking for a fix, and I found one on a gentoo wikipedia.. but I can't use it.  I tried to install gsynaptics, but it doesn't like my atk package
2007-05-22T16:47:00.000Z	wastedfluid		so I'm just at a loss.
2007-05-22T16:47:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	it's a pain, yes: you can add Option "TouchpadOff" 2 to /etc/X11/xorg.conf under the Synaptics Touchpad section, that will turn off all scrolling.
2007-05-22T16:48:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	man synaptics has a whole bunch of things you can adjust, I just used that as a hammer on that problem
2007-05-22T16:49:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	there's some info on turning on SHMConfig (sp?) and then you can interactively change the stuff (ie, experiment)
2007-05-22T05:40:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	add Option "SHMConfig" "On" to the synaptics section of /etc/X11/xorg.cof
2007-05-22T05:40:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	then you'll need to log out, hit ctl-alt-backspace and log back in (may be overkill, but it works every time)
2007-05-22T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/Xorg.conf; but first do cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf to the Desktop
2007-05-22T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	backup before editing, always :)
2007-05-22T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	yes
2007-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	back to my original one: I set option TouchpadOff to 2, it killed it all :)
2007-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	no, I still had mouse control, that turned off the touching being interpreted as mouse clicks
2007-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	Option "TouchpadOff" 2
2007-05-22T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	no, see man synaptics: it'll explain
2007-05-22T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	I have to go, I'll miss my carpool
2007-05-22T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	one sec
2007-05-22T05:56:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	yes
2007-05-22T05:56:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	I'm off, I'll be back 9am pst
2007-05-22T05:59:00.000Z	wastedfluid	nickrud	Wow!
2007-06-16T06:02:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	you probably need libssl-dev
2007-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	nickrud	wastedfluid	it was libssl-dev
