2009-04-24T01:09:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	you are on a cable modem? with or without a router behind that?
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	did you power each down everything, and then power back up; cable modem first, then the router, then the PC
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	couple minutes inbetween each too
2009-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	ah maybe not, i'll try restarting once more, i did it the other way e.g. powered down cable, router but had pc on, i'll go try it again
2009-04-24T01:11:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	it's more about the order when you power back up
2009-04-24T01:11:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	because the error message that pops up in a bubble did change after i restarted the modem and router
2009-04-24T01:11:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	gotta do the pc last
2009-04-24T01:11:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	at first it was saying it couldn't get an ip and then it said it was getting d/c from the network
2009-04-24T01:11:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	I know -- I saw you posts :)
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	i'll let you know how it goes, ty for the help i might wait a bit though cause apparently i downloaded 8.10 last night and so i'm getting the 9.x right now
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	I'll be here
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	cheers
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	remember the correct power up order..OK?
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	ya :)
2009-04-24T01:12:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	cable modem, router , PC
2009-04-24T02:06:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	i got it to work, i think it was the restarting but if it wasn't, the restarting fixed it :) now to wait to download 9.x and reinstall, hahah, cheers mate, thanks again
2009-04-24T02:07:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	very good my friend -- try Xchat for IRC
2009-04-24T02:15:00.000Z	mrwes	PassePartouT	I told you it was all about the proper power up sequence :)
2009-04-24T02:15:00.000Z	PassePartouT	mrwes	haha yeah, brings me back to the days of win98 when your ethernet falls out and you need to restart just to get internet again :P picky procedures but at least they always work :P
