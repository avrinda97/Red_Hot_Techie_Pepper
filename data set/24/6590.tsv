2006-06-11T07:08:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	might be easier to clear it via the browser
2006-06-11T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	that looks like a problem with the turbogears website.
2006-06-11T11:26:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	when i was still is breezy someone help me intall the turbogears and it was a success.
2006-06-11T11:26:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	but when i reformated my computer and upgraded to Dapperdrake. doin the same process doesnt work
2006-06-11T11:27:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	it could be the website. or there should be another alternative
2006-06-11T11:27:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	right, but it's a problem with their website, if you look, you see it can't find a file on their site.  Ubuntu has nothing to do with it.
2006-06-11T11:27:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	thanks. 90% it could be
2006-06-11T11:27:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	contact their support, since if they fix their site, or their setup script, it should work.  Ubuntu has no control over either.
2006-06-11T11:28:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	did you tried to install it??
2006-06-11T11:28:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	I did not.
2006-06-11T11:29:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	how were you able to say that its the problem of their backend??
2006-06-11T11:30:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	because the error the script gave,says it can't find a file on their site.
2006-06-11T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	Ubuntu doesn't control that script, or their site, so it's obviously not ubuntu related
2006-06-11T11:32:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	did you also checked this??? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15509
2006-06-11T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	yes, that's what I was looking at.
2006-06-11T11:33:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	So i just have to wait for them to fix the site then
2006-06-11T11:34:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	right.  You might try asking them about it, via email or if they have a forum, or whatever.  It's a problem they need to deal with, not anything Ubuntu can do about it.
2006-07-19T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	remove the # to uncomment
2006-07-19T10:24:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	but why does Flash MX in Wine hq tells me to uncomment where i dont have something to uncomment
2006-07-19T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	because the tutorial isn't designed for ubuntu maybe.
2006-07-19T10:27:00.000Z	harry	Flannel	it exactly said Ubuntu 6.06
2007-03-31T09:25:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	yep.  And there are even services that'll do a dynamic IP redirect thing, check out dyndns and others
2007-05-12T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	check out AptOnCD
2007-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	Flannel	harry	Pidgin will be in Gutsy.  It's not in anything
