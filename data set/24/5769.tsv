2007-03-10T15:24:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	I tried that, but that didn't work either.
2007-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	are you on dapper or edgy?
2007-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	how can I check?
2007-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	lsb_release -a
2007-03-10T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	er... Are you on linux?
2007-03-10T15:26:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	yea....
2007-03-10T15:26:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	You're using what flavor of ubuntu?
2007-03-10T15:26:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	I don't know =P
2007-03-10T15:26:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	Ubuntu? Kubuntu? Xubuntu?  What did you install?
2007-03-10T15:26:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	I didn't do that install myself.
2007-03-10T15:27:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	The docs say it is "Ubuntu 6.06"
2007-03-10T15:27:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	I see.  Ok, well, uh, what color is the desktop?
2007-03-10T15:27:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	well, I'm logged in via SSH from a RHEL machine... I don't see what desktop color would tell you...
2007-03-10T15:28:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	What does 'uname -a' give?
2007-03-10T15:29:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	Er... did you compile your own kernel?
2007-03-10T15:30:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	the guy that setup the machine did.
2007-03-10T15:30:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	But I don't see what that has to do with installing xemacs?
2007-03-10T15:31:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	Well, we were trying to figure out what eversion of ubuntu you had.  But, honestly, I don't think you're running Ubuntu.  Or, well, if it is, its... far from stock.  You apparently have no hostname, and the lack of lsb_release frightens me as well.
2007-03-10T15:31:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	but, you need to enable the universe repository, xemacs21 is in universe.
2007-03-10T15:32:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	I think he stripped it down to remove some of the "cruft" and save space.
2007-03-10T15:32:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	er... that's hardly cruft.  Its.. quite essential.
2007-03-11T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	not that I'm aware of.  What do you need help configuring?
2007-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	arrummzen	Flannel	I want to configure Apache2 to host a Django web app.
2007-03-11T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	arrummzen	What does Django need?
