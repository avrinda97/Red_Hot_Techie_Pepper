2010-07-23T20:25:00.000Z	metalgeek		hi, is there any reason why gdesklets might not work for Ubuntu 10.04?
2010-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	sipior	metalgeek	is this a roundabout way of saying "gdesklets doesn't work on my 10.04 system"?
2010-07-23T20:28:00.000Z	metalgeek	sipior	,your one sharpe cookie, i feel stupid, but i don't know the file structure of Ubuntu well enough yet to even know where to start. I've only been using linux for a week ;)
2010-07-23T20:28:00.000Z	sipior	metalgeek	what happens if you try "gdekslets" from a terminal?
