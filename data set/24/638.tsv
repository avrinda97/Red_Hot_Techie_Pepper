2011-04-23T11:08:00.000Z	chaembian		Powercut... just got back.
2011-04-23T11:09:00.000Z	chaembian		lock-up in the recovery console as well
2011-04-23T11:09:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	What are you trying to do?
2011-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	On a live session?
2011-04-23T11:19:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	I'm on IRC from my desktop
2011-04-23T11:21:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	I think I may have missed your problem. Can you explain whats wrong, when the lockups happen, what gpu you have etc?
2011-04-23T11:27:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	Sure. Its a Toshiba Satellite A200. Core 2 Duo T7500, Phoenix bios, intel 965gm chipset
2011-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	What gpu do you have?
2011-04-23T11:30:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	Do you have any other operating system installed to test if the same problem happens? (if it does, it could be a hardware failure)
2011-04-23T11:31:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	Nope, I wiped the Windows it was running before.
2011-04-23T11:36:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	If I were to guess, Id say hw failure but i really didnt read any of your messages because..
2011-04-23T11:47:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	OK, there is a "ACPI: If "acpi_apic_instance=2" works better, notify linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org" -- but both default and acpi_apic_instance=2 yields the same thing.
2011-04-23T11:47:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	When I had JFS the system would lock-up only after a while. With EXT4, its under five minutes.
2011-04-23T11:48:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	Was that better?
2011-04-23T11:49:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	took few mins to understand that you're invoking bot to make common statements
2011-04-23T11:50:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	You probably should try to look at some logs. Is it a hard lock? Or does X just hang? could be a hard drive failure or anything
2011-04-23T11:52:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	as far as I can tell, hardware is good. The laptop is my dad's and he's been mainintaining it real well.
2011-04-23T11:53:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	What is a hard lock? I did 'watch -d cat /proc/interrupts' and saw the IO-APIC-Edge-timer freeze during the lock up.
2011-04-23T11:57:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	during googling, I came up with another thread where i7 had similar lock-up issues. I came across 'watch -d cat /proc/interrupts' from there.
2011-04-23T11:58:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	Try getting the information from /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages
2011-04-23T12:00:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	no obvious errors there, to the extent I can see. what should I be looking out for?
2011-04-23T12:01:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	No idea really, as I dont know what is causing your lockup. (you should be looking for some hint as to why its locking up)
2011-04-23T12:02:00.000Z	chaembian	soreau	OK, thank you!
2011-04-23T12:02:00.000Z	soreau	chaembian	Does this also happen in a live session btw?
