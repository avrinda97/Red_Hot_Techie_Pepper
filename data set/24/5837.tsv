2008-03-21T18:24:00.000Z	wubrgamer		32bit, it's the most compatible, and there is no good flash on 64bit
2008-03-21T18:25:00.000Z	wubrgamer		anybody know how to get X running from scratch ? I just don't know what packages I need to install
2008-03-21T18:26:00.000Z	waylandbill	wubrgamer	installing a desktop environment should pull in X.
2008-03-21T18:26:00.000Z	wubrgamer		openbox isn't a DE
2008-03-21T18:27:00.000Z	wubrgamer		you just said something about wireless cards to a question about X, anyway thanks Slart, you might want to take a break from helping these n00bs
2008-03-21T18:28:00.000Z	wubrgamer		haha, xserver doesn't pull in xorg ?
2008-03-21T18:28:00.000Z	wubrgamer		that's silly
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	waylandbill	wubrgamer	xserver-xorg ?
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		what wouldn't a full X be ?
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I'm trying to keep it as minimal as possible,
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		and I don't want a window manager if I can help it
2008-03-21T18:30:00.000Z	wubrgamer		no no no
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I meant display manager
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		GDM, XDM, KDM, WDM etc
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	waylandbill	wubrgamer	openbox depends on X libs, so it should pull in x for you.
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		I thought ndiswrapper was a wireless thing exclusively...
2008-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	wubrgamer		huh
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		openbox doesn't pull in much
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		anyway, I JUST got it working
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		turns out I installed everything in the world BUT xorg
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	waylandbill	wubrgamer	that's interesting as I'm looking at the list of dependencies.
2008-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	wubrgamer		gutsy ?
2008-03-21T18:33:00.000Z	wubrgamer	waylandbill	gutsy ?
2008-03-21T18:33:00.000Z	waylandbill	wubrgamer	yes
