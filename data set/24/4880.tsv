2006-12-23T12:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	any idea what the make of the remote is?
2006-12-23T12:38:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	is this it? http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MCE_Remote
2006-12-23T12:41:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	ok, saying what?
2006-12-23T12:42:00.000Z	timo901	un_operateur	first i cd to /usr/src/lirc-0.8.0
2006-12-23T12:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	because usually you need to run a ./configure first  -- and there might be other steps you need to take
2006-12-23T12:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	why don't you have a try now -- see what errors you get, i'd like to see how it works too :)
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	first things first -- read the README and INSTALL files
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	they'll have information on any obscure steps you might need to take
2006-12-24T08:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	run the glxgears program
2006-12-24T08:13:00.000Z	timo901	un_operateur	 gears has always worked
2006-12-24T08:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	the load which it puts on the system should be greatly lessened if the right drivers are installed
2006-12-24T16:29:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	you could try something new out -- like sdm
2006-12-24T16:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	timo901	what works works :)
