2006-06-12T15:23:00.000Z	rixxon		i want to send mp3s to my sisters mobile phone over ir, my laptop has ir etcetera, but what to do?
2006-06-12T15:24:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	are you using irda?
2006-06-12T15:25:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	hm? probably not since i don't know. i tried to send from the phone to the laptop, it said no receiver available (kinda)
2006-06-12T15:25:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	i guess my ir port is inactive
2006-06-12T15:25:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	I asume your ir hardware is supported
2006-06-12T15:25:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	no idea. should i try irda-utils or gsm-utils or something?
2006-06-12T15:26:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	yes
2006-06-12T15:26:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	which one? :P
2006-06-12T15:27:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	irda-utils are command line tools
2006-06-12T15:27:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	don't i need to enable my ir port with something?
2006-06-12T15:28:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	you need ensure that it's turned on in the bios
2006-06-12T15:28:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	oh :p
2006-06-12T15:28:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	been there many times, can't recall anything regarding ir
2006-06-12T15:28:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	how is your irda connected to the computer?
2006-06-12T15:29:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	laptop, built in
2006-06-12T15:29:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	it will be in the serial port part of the bios
2006-06-12T15:30:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	is tnere no easy way, like i put the mobile in front of my ir port, and some kind of /media drive shows up? :S
2006-06-12T15:31:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	that's how i'd like it anyway, like a usb memory or something
2006-06-12T15:32:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	the problem is that irdais based on serial ports and usb is far far newer and serial ports don't have the ability to even tell you about the device your working with, it's just poke out the instructions and hope someting is listening
2006-06-12T15:33:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	oh, i guess i can understand that. i do know it can tell if something responds though
2006-06-12T15:33:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	but perhaps not really create a true connection
2006-06-12T15:33:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	btw, i recall now, IR have worked in windows before, so it is probably enabled in bios
2006-06-12T15:34:00.000Z	_doctormo	rixxon	yes it's got certain protocalls ect, certain things it expects in response. the best thing I find is to cat /dev/irda and poke the dive at it because the device will shop data in the cat as it tries to connect to the computer
2006-06-12T15:35:00.000Z	rixxon	_doctormo	or maybe the irdaping command line tool i just installed...
