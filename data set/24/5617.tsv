2006-06-19T12:13:00.000Z	mooseman089	nekostar	for some reason recently ubuntu will randomly stop accepting connections like ssh, ftp, http, and vnc for no known reason
2006-06-19T12:13:00.000Z	nekostar	mooseman089	it just kills the net kinda and then eventually lets it back ?
2006-06-19T12:14:00.000Z	mooseman089	nekostar	if i still have a active connection like vnc session its fine but if i try to start another it just times out and nothing happens
2006-06-19T12:15:00.000Z	nekostar	mooseman089	yeah im familiar with that.. but the other person i know who has that is on windows
