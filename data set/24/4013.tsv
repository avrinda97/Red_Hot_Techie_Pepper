2008-08-20T02:38:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	what is the output of lspci | grep Network
2008-08-20T02:39:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	then type 'lspci | grep Network' if you get nothing try 'lspci'
2008-08-20T02:39:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	that will output all the pci hardware devices you have, specificall yyour wireless card, so you can get it fixed
2008-08-20T02:40:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	np.  It's shift + the button above enter
2008-08-20T02:43:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	ok, i'm about to give you a link with a lot of stuff you can just copy and paste, post here if you have issues, as you might have on a few steps. http://invaleed.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/install-bcm94311mcg-wlan-mini-pci-ubuntu-710/
2008-08-20T02:44:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	before you start, do you have a wired connection?
2008-08-20T02:45:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	ok, it'll be a *lot* easier if you can plug it in and connect to the internet via that way so you don't have to manually download on another computer and transfer it to your laptop
2008-08-20T02:47:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	ok, one second before you start
2008-08-20T02:47:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	for every instruction where it says "vim" type "gedit" instead
2008-08-20T02:48:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	that should be it
2008-08-20T02:48:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	it's a more freindly text editor
2008-08-20T02:50:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	the top? just copy and paste (use control +shift + v to paste in terminal) one line at a time
2008-08-20T02:51:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	I don't understand
2008-08-20T02:51:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	you have applications - accesories - terminal open?  Follow the instructions on the page, copy and pasting everything that looks like a command
2008-08-20T02:51:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	the instructions are on that page
2008-08-20T02:52:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	http://invaleed.wordpress.com/2007/11/20/install-bcm94311mcg-wlan-mini-pci-ubuntu-710/
2008-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	where it says "add this line" just paste it on a new line at the bottom.  I don't see where you see "replace" this line
2008-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	if you have any other questions, just ask the channel, i have to go for a few minutes
2008-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	RequinB4	frosty	yes, new line at bottom
