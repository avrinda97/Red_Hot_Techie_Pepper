2009-11-22T02:48:00.000Z	coachz		what is BSSID in my wireless setup please ?
2009-11-22T02:49:00.000Z	coachz		the SSID ?
2009-11-22T02:49:00.000Z	coachz		i have an SSID
2009-11-22T02:49:00.000Z	coachz		and in the admin panel for the wireless it's called SSID wireless network name
2009-11-22T02:50:00.000Z	coachz		but there is a mac address box right below BSSID on the ubuntu wireless config panel
2009-11-22T02:52:00.000Z	coachz		the web says  BSSID is randomly generated for the network in question
2009-11-22T02:52:00.000Z	coachz		i have no idea what it is though
2009-11-22T02:54:00.000Z	coachz		per yahoo  SSID stands for Service Set Identifier.  BSSID stands for Broadcast Service Set Identifier.  They are exactly the same thing. It is the 'name' of the wireless network that shows up under network connections.
2009-11-22T02:56:00.000Z	coachz		how come Apply is greyed out in adding a wireless connection
2009-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	coachz		how can i add a wireless point if Apply is greyed out ?
2009-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	it should turn solid (no longer greyed out) if you filled out all necessary info
2010-07-17T16:59:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	no need to complain about redhat doc in #ubuntu ...
2010-07-17T17:01:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	we would need details on what you are trying to do
2010-07-17T17:02:00.000Z	coachz	oCean_	 sorry, i have 2 files and 2 dirs i'm trying to zip up tiny and move
2010-07-17T17:03:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	tar archive.tar file1 file2 directory1/* directory2/* would make archive.tar of those files/directories specified. Use bzip2 archive.tar to compress the .tar to .tar.bz2
2010-07-17T17:04:00.000Z	coachz	oCean_	how would i do it all on one line ?
2010-07-17T17:05:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	add "j" to the tar options
2010-07-17T17:06:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	no the "j" option does that for you, see "man tar"
2010-07-17T17:09:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	but now I told you howto, right?
2010-07-17T17:10:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	okay once more, hold on
2010-07-17T17:11:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	tar cvfj myarchive.tar.bz2 file1 file2 directory1/* directory2/*
2010-07-17T17:11:00.000Z	oCean_	coachz	you're most welcoem
2010-07-17T17:19:00.000Z	coachz	oCean_	 that screwed me up
2010-07-17T17:24:00.000Z	coachz	oCean_	?
