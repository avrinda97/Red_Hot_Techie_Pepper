2008-12-15T23:45:00.000Z	DasEI		 Marfi:HAL = Hardware Abstraction Layer, watch /var/log/syslog for further hints
2008-12-15T23:46:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	scanning it now. thats a big file.....
2008-12-15T23:50:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	a quick n simple try is reinstallation of hal
2008-12-15T23:51:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	tried it, and still didn't initialize back up. found one thing that looks odd in the syslog, though. "failed to load module 'module-hal-detect' " under pulseaudio
2008-12-15T23:52:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	which soundcard ? (lshw)
2008-12-15T23:52:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	sound works fine. ill get the model for you, hold on
2008-12-15T23:53:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	nvidia mcp51 audio driver
2008-12-15T23:56:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	if it's pulse causing the trouble, alsa should work fine, too
2008-12-15T23:56:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	then...how do i go about fixing the HAL problem?
2008-12-16T00:01:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	disabled pulse, set it to alsa, and restarting. also caught a glimpse, and it said to make sure dbus is starting
2008-12-16T00:04:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	disabled pulse, and still the same problem.
2008-12-16T00:05:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	: did you reboot or restart hal n dbus (soundserver?)
2008-12-16T00:05:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	rebooted the computer, thinking that would do it
2008-12-16T00:05:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	: nice hope, yes.. paste your syslog
2008-12-16T00:06:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	: and kernel.log, too
2008-12-16T00:06:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	i got the first ubuntu sound when the login screen comes, but don't know after that. hold on, let me grab it
2008-12-16T00:12:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	same thing in the syslog file, except its still booting the pulseaudio. how do i disable it?
2008-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	: can we see syslog and kernel.log ?
2008-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	it screwed up, and im just gonna do a reinstall of it, and hope that gets it back up
2008-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	:or you have some patience and wait for better advice ..
2008-12-16T00:18:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	i've been working on it for the past 6 hours....it won't even let me log in now
2008-12-16T00:18:00.000Z	DasEI	Marfi	give it a rest then
2008-12-16T00:19:00.000Z	Marfi	DasEI	hes leaving in the morning. =)
