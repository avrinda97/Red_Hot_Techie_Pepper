2007-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	he seems to be on a monologue... talking to him has no effect
2007-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Just hope he dosent drift into a troll
2007-07-28T16:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Where do you get tremulous and how hard is it to install?
2007-07-28T16:20:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	what?! how?
2007-07-28T16:22:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	ah, did it download it first?
2007-07-28T16:23:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	trry using synaptics, and select the package "tremulous"
2007-07-28T16:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Same error unable to install unmet dependencies
2007-07-28T16:24:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	do you have the universe repository added?
2007-07-28T16:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	No biggie just wanted you to know
2007-07-28T16:25:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	hmmm, that's really weird. I guess you can always get the standalone installer from http://tremulous.net/files/
2007-07-28T16:28:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	so, what version of libopenal0a does it need, and which version do you have?
2007-07-28T16:28:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	don't give up, tremulous is the best game in the entire world!
2007-07-28T16:29:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	oh, Dapper! hmm, I've only ever used it on edgy and feisty...
2007-07-28T16:30:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	OK then, just remember this game for the time when you upgrade to a later ubuntu version
2007-07-28T16:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Depends: tremulous-data (>=1.1.0-1) but it is not installable
2007-08-22T07:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	I disagree
2007-08-22T07:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Feisty is latest stable
2007-11-28T02:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	Drop it..
2007-11-28T02:03:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	no you
2007-11-28T02:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	You are being disrespectfull to the entire channel..
2007-11-28T02:04:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	thank you for your input. I like collaberating with you like this
2007-11-28T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	he dosent care.. he already knows it all
2007-11-28T03:24:00.000Z	pete83	Jack_Sparrow	yes he seems to be pretty attached to his bootloader. Gosh, aren't we all...
2007-11-28T03:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pete83	:)
