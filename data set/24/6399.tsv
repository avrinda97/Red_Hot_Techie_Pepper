2005-10-22T05:43:00.000Z	tidalwav1		Hi, guys, I haven't been in here in a while ;)
2005-10-22T05:43:00.000Z	tidalwav1		little problem, and I know 3000 other people on the forums have the same one: the NVIDIA driver doesn't work.
2005-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	tidalwav1		I have a pretty old card that worked fine with nvidia-glx before Breezy, and now, nothing.
2005-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	tidalwav1		tiglionL try glxgears
2005-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	tidalwav1		what exactly happens, tk
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tidalwav1		tiglion: see? ;)
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tidalwav1		vanish: you probably need libmad
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tidalwav1		or something
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tidalwav1		tiglion, I have the same question.
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tidalwav1		tiglion: you never noticed before? :P
2005-10-22T05:45:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	i get a black screen when gdm should give a log in screen. it's completely frozen and doesn't let me restart X or anything
2005-10-22T05:46:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	Weird. Was it working before? And is your name a starwars reference? ;)
2005-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	yes thank you for noticing! I just did a clean install from cd and the first boot postinstall went fine, but then I rebooted and it doesn't come up
2005-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	did you install anything weird that would have killed X in between those two times?
2005-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	the only way it comes up is by going into recovery mode and then # gdm or startx as root
2005-10-22T05:48:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	no, i just set up the repositories and upgraded like 3-4 packages that it called for and that was it
2005-10-22T05:50:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	No idea why your x broke :P
2005-10-22T05:51:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	I think there's a command to reconfigure X manaully but I forget what it is :P
2005-10-22T05:52:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	i can start gdm manually from command line by recovery mode, why won't it start otherwise?
2005-10-22T05:52:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	ah, I misread what you wrote.
2005-10-22T05:53:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	no problem. this happened to me before with the preview release. i thought it was just going to work itself out by the final
2005-10-22T05:54:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	could it have something to do with the .xsession file?
2005-10-22T05:55:00.000Z	tk401	tidalwav1	I'm not sure what that file does actually, i'm still kinda new to linux
2005-10-22T05:55:00.000Z	tidalwav1	tk401	so am I :P but try looking at the end of that file and see if you see anything about gnome-session
