2007-10-25T18:54:00.000Z	Seivan|		Is there like a WAMP but for linux to get via synaptic?
2007-10-25T18:54:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	what is "WAMP"?
2007-10-25T18:54:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	windows apache mysql php
2007-10-25T18:55:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	but instead of windows, maybe linux
2007-10-25T18:56:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	it doesnt work, there is no lamp-server
2007-10-25T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	you need to be more specific.  What exactly did you do and what exactly was the outcome?
2007-10-25T18:57:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	sudo apt-get install lamp-server
2007-10-25T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	take a closer look at the wiki page, that's not what it says
2007-10-25T18:58:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	I did tried taskel but it just freezes at 0%
2007-10-25T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	wait a few minutes
2007-10-25T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	if that doesn't work, follow the rest of the page
2007-10-25T18:59:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	but I want lamp, not standalone apache and php and mysql
2007-10-25T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	that's what lamp is...
2007-10-25T19:01:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	yeah but LAMP comes ready configured :/
2007-10-25T19:02:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	LAMP is just an acronym.  Apache, mysql, and php come configured in ubuntu too after you install them
2007-10-25T19:03:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	roger, thanks =)
2007-10-25T19:04:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	why doesnt tasksel work?
2007-10-25T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	I don't know
2007-10-25T19:04:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	it just freezes at 0%, cant cancel it either, I got gutsy
2007-10-25T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	see if there are any bugs reported at bugs.ubuntu.com
2007-10-25T19:06:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	what about myPHPAdmin or sqlLIte
2007-10-25T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	Seivan|	those are in the repositories as well
2007-10-25T19:07:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	now I have installed them all.. how do I controll the webserver and stuff?
2007-10-25T19:07:00.000Z	Seivan|	jrib	where is the "control panel"
