2005-09-06T13:32:00.000Z	traveller		it seems like smeg is not available for amd64
2005-09-06T13:34:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	i can teach you how to manually add in gnome menu entries
2005-09-06T13:37:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	that would be nice
2005-09-06T13:37:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	in /usr/share/applications/ there are a lot of .desktop files, make a copy of one and edit the variables inside (very easy)
2005-09-06T13:37:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	if you need help ask me
2005-09-06T13:38:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	i'll look around, thanks
2005-09-06T13:38:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	to edit .desktop files you can use any text editor
2005-09-06T13:39:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	and if you can't do it, i can make one for you :)
2005-09-06T13:40:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	i don't see any .desktop files
2005-09-06T13:40:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	it won't show as .desktop if you just go to the folder, but they are all .desktop files
2005-09-06T13:40:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	do this in a terminal and you'll see
2005-09-06T13:41:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	ls /usr/share/applications
2005-09-06T13:41:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	if you want, private message me and i'll help you step by step
2005-09-06T13:42:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	oh ok...i found it....wasn't used to this type of tab completion
2005-09-06T13:44:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	here's an example of a .desktop file i made for ppracer (the racing game) http://rafb.net/paste/results/PhYo8d66.nln.html
2005-09-06T13:44:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	thanks
2005-09-06T13:45:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	the only hard part is "Categories=" (getting it to appear in the right submenu)
2005-09-06T13:47:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	if you want to (for example) get something to appear in the internet menu, look at the .desktop of a program in the internet menu (for example gaim) and see what the Categories= is set to
2005-09-06T13:47:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	will do
2005-09-06T13:48:00.000Z	omp342		and to create a .desktop file in that folder you'll need to be root... i believe it's the sudo command in ubuntu (i don't use ubuntu)
2005-09-06T13:48:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	^^
2005-09-06T13:49:00.000Z	traveller	omp342	no worries, i'll get all that sorted
2005-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	okay, and for it to appear in the menu you'll either have to restart X or write "killall gnome-panel" in a terminal (it will close gnome-panel and reopen it)
2005-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	omp342	traveller	if you need anything else, ask :)
