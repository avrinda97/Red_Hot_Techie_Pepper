2005-04-18T11:05:00.000Z	vessuvius		Does anyone know where the kernel sits and what its name is for hoary?
2005-04-18T11:06:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	run "uname -r" in a console. The kernel is in /boot
2005-04-18T11:08:00.000Z	vessuvius	trygvebw	I'm trying to tell Grub where it is, can't boot into it right now :-/
2005-04-18T11:26:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	no
2005-04-18T11:26:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	i have been running Hoary since october, and i have had nearly no issues/problems
2005-04-18T11:27:00.000Z	vessuvius	trygvebw	do you know anything about how an upgrade will work from the rc to the release?
2005-04-18T11:27:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	It will work very good :)
2005-04-18T11:51:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	I have never used anything else than just / and swap
2005-04-18T11:53:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	it's just a waste to but everything else than /home / and swap on different partitions
2005-04-18T11:54:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	yeah
2005-04-18T11:54:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	on older distributions it could've been smart, but not on Ubuntu
2005-04-18T11:55:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	:P
2005-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	depends on your use
2005-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	vessuvius	trygvebw	do you prefer reiser or ext3?
2005-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	reiserfs
2005-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	i think it's a lot more stable
2005-04-18T12:01:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	i *don't* think that you have to do any of them bootable, but in case, just make /boot bootable :)
2005-04-18T12:02:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	yeah
2005-04-18T12:02:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	what do you mean?
2005-04-18T12:03:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	i don't think that that matters for linux
2005-04-18T12:04:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	yeah, probably :) so put / on the outside
2005-04-18T12:10:00.000Z	vessuvius	trygvebw	do you think 20 GB is plenty for /?
2005-04-18T12:10:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	yup, more than enough :)
2005-04-18T12:15:00.000Z	trygvebw	vessuvius	make sense: no such target: sense
