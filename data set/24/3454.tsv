2009-12-29T04:17:00.000Z	froglet		I tried to install Ubuntu remix alongside openSUSE and I messed it up, perhaps because I set Ubuntu to share /boot partition.  What is the correct way of doing it?
2009-12-29T04:17:00.000Z	froglet		I am reinstalling Ubuntu Netbook Remix now and will install Ubuntu later
2009-12-29T04:18:00.000Z	froglet		I am reinstalling Ubuntu Netbook Remix now and will install openSUSE
2009-12-29T04:18:00.000Z	froglet		later

2009-12-29T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	froglet	it read like a disgruntled ubuntu ad a say to suse, my bad, sorry
2009-12-29T04:21:00.000Z	froglet	ActionParsnip	no no, I should have explained it better
2009-12-29T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	froglet	you can install both next to each other, they are essentially te same OS
2009-12-29T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	froglet	if you reinstall, partition the drive(s) with free space with which to use for ubuntu
2009-12-29T04:22:00.000Z	froglet	ActionParsnip	did I mess it up because I tried to use the same /boot partition for Ubuntu that I used for openSUSE?
2009-12-29T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	froglet	should be ok provided there is space and you didnt tell the installer to format it
2009-12-29T04:23:00.000Z	froglet	ActionParsnip	I am stumped then.  I will keep trying until I get it right
2009-12-29T04:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	froglet	you should have one
