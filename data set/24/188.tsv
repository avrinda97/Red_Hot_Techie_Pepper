2012-03-29T20:23:00.000Z	SubD		i'm trying to get into my share on ubuntu 10.04.4 wich I used to be able to do, but now I cant, all I get is this error http://pastebin.com/jvGbsp3D any one know what went wrong?
2012-03-29T20:25:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	can you ping the XBMC box?
2012-03-29T20:26:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	yea, and I can putty to it, just cant access it's shares
2012-03-29T20:27:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	what's changed since it did work?
2012-03-29T20:28:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	all I did was deleting a folder within a shared folder, and restarting, nothing else that I can think of
2012-03-29T20:28:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	no upgrades recently?
2012-03-29T20:29:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	is the share completely open for guest access or is it password locked?
2012-03-29T20:31:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	I did upgrade from 10.04 to 10.04.4, but that a little before the trouble, it should have password on it. I did ad a user to samba, and made a password to the XBMC access becouse of my android remote control
2012-03-29T20:33:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	did you configure the share via samba.conf ?
2012-03-29T20:36:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	yes, I added this http://paste.ubuntu.com/905872/
2012-03-29T20:37:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	ah ok that's a guest enabled share then. so no password config. run 'testparm' on that box via SSH. also, what Windows version is it trying to connect to that share?
2012-03-29T20:39:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	http://paste.ubuntu.com/905873/ i'm running win7
2012-03-29T20:39:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	have you installed any Games for Windows Live recently? that sometimes breaks samba
2012-03-29T20:41:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	nope, all I have installed for some days is Comodo internet security
2012-03-29T20:41:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	ah well that could possibly be messing with things
2012-03-29T20:42:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	I've used comodo for years, and never had any trouble with it :/
2012-03-29T20:44:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	I tried disabling all services in comodo, and exit it, still get that damn error :/
2012-03-29T20:45:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	almost sounds like it's not even running on the server end - tried restarting/starting the samba services?
2012-03-29T20:47:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	I've tried restarting/stoping/starting the smbd and even reestarted and shutdown the PC, no luck there
2012-03-29T20:48:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	clean starts and stops i take it? checked in the logs too?
2012-03-29T20:49:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	explain "clean" starts and stops please?
2012-03-29T20:49:00.000Z	daftykins	SubD	no error messages spewing anger :D
2012-03-29T20:50:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	ah lol, yeah clean start stop etc. no errors
2012-03-29T21:05:00.000Z	SubD	daftykins	this is the latest logs I have from samba http://paste.ubuntu.com/905910/
