2007-12-07T14:05:00.000Z	gaten		why won't nautlus show one of my local mounted drives? it shows every other one, except for my "winshare" drive. is it because it's fat32?
2007-12-07T14:05:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	probably.  if you made it skinny32, it might want to see it.
2007-12-07T14:06:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	anyway to force it to show up?
2007-12-07T14:06:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	you could try to mount it manually.  check "mount --help"
2007-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	it mounts fine. it just doesn't show up in Nautilus
2007-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	something like "mount -t vfat /dev/hdaX /mnt/windows" or whatever where X is the partition number.
2007-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	oh
2007-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	uh...  where is it mounted?
2007-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	/media, like everything else
2007-12-07T14:08:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	and yes, i can read and write files to it
2007-12-07T14:09:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	not the point.  is there anything on it?
2007-12-07T14:09:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	oh yes, tons of stuff. and i can access it all
2007-12-07T14:09:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	but it just won't show up in nautilus?
2007-12-07T14:10:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	correct
2007-12-07T14:11:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	yes, for all intents and purposes, it works perfect. wait, let me amend my problem. it doesn't show up on the left hand side in nautilus, in the "shortcut" tree menu. i can browse to it by going to /media, but i can't see it listed in the shortcuts
2007-12-07T14:12:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	browse to /media/ and drag the folder to the shortcuts side (usually the bottom half)
2007-12-07T14:13:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	nope. this is in tree view, btw
2007-12-07T14:14:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	no clue how to get it there.
2007-12-07T14:14:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	all well, no one else does either :P i find it very odd. oh well, thanks anyway
2007-12-07T14:15:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	i'm looking at my .nautilus directory in my home folder.  i suggest you do the same
2007-12-07T14:16:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	you might find help in that folder
2007-12-07T14:16:00.000Z	gaten	AgentHeX	thanks, ill try that
2007-12-07T14:17:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	could, of course, be that Trash was in my history, but you never know...
2007-12-07T14:17:00.000Z	AgentHeX	gaten	yeah...  no dice finding Desktop in there
