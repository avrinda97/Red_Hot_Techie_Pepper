2008-11-23T06:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	did you set your root correctly?
2008-11-23T06:23:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		if you want to know something about my system you are going to have to give me a command to get that info
2008-11-23T06:23:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		let me recap what I have done so far
2008-11-23T06:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	that doesn't help, sorry. i'm asking if you ran a certain command within grub to set it right.
2008-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	Greencoat19821	Gnea	which command
2008-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	the command to set the root device
2008-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		duh, what is that command
2008-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	Gnea		it's in the HOWTO
2008-11-23T06:24:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		right and if the how to was working fo rme, do you think I would be here asking for help?
2008-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		ok the output of "find /sbin/init" is (hd0,0)
2008-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		Ok maybe I should point out that I have NO idea how to use GRub
2008-11-23T06:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	specifically, http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-natively.html#Installing-GRUB-natively spells it out
2008-11-23T06:27:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		already been there n8tuser
2008-11-23T06:27:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		I'm not usually spoonfed, I
2008-11-23T06:28:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		've just never ever used grub beyond letting it boot my regular image
2008-11-23T06:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	please, read the URL and do some testing on your own with it... you can use the tab-key with the find command
2008-11-23T06:28:00.000Z	Greencoat19821		and if I'm not learning from the faqs should I just give up and shoot myself or come here and ask for help?
2008-11-23T06:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Greencoat19821	you should probably de-stress yourself before continuing
