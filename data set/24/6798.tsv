2005-10-08T13:32:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	it's ok to remove gnome, you can install any windows manager you like, such as KDE, xfce, etc
2005-10-08T13:32:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	but if you have a lot of hdd space, try to install other window manager without removing gnome
2005-10-08T13:33:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	if you satisfied, then you may remove gnome :)
2005-10-08T13:33:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	personally i prefer gnome
2005-10-08T13:34:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	then try installing kubuntu-desktop
2005-10-08T13:34:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2005-10-08T13:35:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	and you could always run kde apps in gnome
2005-10-08T13:36:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	HappyFool said the package name is kstars, try installing it and run it in gnome
2005-10-08T13:37:00.000Z	Belutz	sambagirl	it's ok
