2010-04-14T12:06:00.000Z	TyanColte		i still want win7 to be my default OS it's just when i reboot while in ubuntu i want it to automatically restart with ubuntu instead of defaulting to win7

2010-04-14T12:11:00.000Z	TyanColte		i love my dual boot, i just want to be able to have it automate the reboot process when i have to reboot ubuntu, i can already do this in windows using iReboot
2010-04-14T12:11:00.000Z	TyanColte		and i can actually reboot into ubuntu from windows using ireboot
2010-04-14T12:12:00.000Z	Vigo	TyanColte	Did you set the boot option?
