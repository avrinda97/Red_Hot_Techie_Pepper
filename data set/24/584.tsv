2011-10-19T15:51:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	xD
2011-10-19T15:52:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	No joy?
2011-10-19T15:53:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- I wrote the response to the bot.. xD " done and done. Still nothing. (that is, I don't remember the root password either. And that link si what I was talking about)"
2011-10-19T15:53:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	What do you mean, root password?  Did you create a root password?  (Because normally, there isn't one.)
2011-10-19T15:54:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- I don't remember creating one. But when I go into recovery mode, then root, it says 'please enter root password for maintenance'.
2011-10-19T15:55:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	If you have followed the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword and still can't recover, I don't know.  Accept that you could boot from the CD and use sudo to edit shadow file.
2011-10-19T15:57:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- ok , different question then. How can I tell 'ls' command to write the full path of a file each time? such that if I use 'ls -R | grep passwd' i'll ge the full path?
2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	You might try and  edit /etc/shadow  go to original user and delete all between first and second colons (:)
2011-10-19T16:06:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	More-than-likely, only the original user has admin priviledges and so that is the one you need.
2011-10-19T16:06:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- anyway to create new user editing the file rather than editing?
2011-10-19T16:06:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- I just want any user, so I can login into my normal shell with all the commands. At least for nwo, anyway.
2011-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	I really dont' know why the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword#The_Other_Way  or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword  didn't work for you.  Did you do exactly as instructed?
2011-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	yes. First way didn't work because of the 'Give root password for maintenance'. Second way didn't work because I don't have any kernel in my boot list. Third way is where i'm at now, but there is no passwd utility from some reason.
2011-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- well, there is one thing. At first I tried editing the 'normal' image (init=/bin/bash) and entering it, but it just didn't run anything after I booted (F10 or ctrl-x). So I did the same fro the recovery mode and used it. I'm there now.
2011-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	You don't have a kernel?
2011-10-19T16:10:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- it's not listed. there are 4 entries in the list: (1) Ubuntu, with Linux .. (2) same thing, (recovery mode) (3) Memory test (4) Memory test with some extra details.
2011-10-19T16:11:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	Those ARE your kernels.  You have been given adequate information, you just need to sort though it and puzzle it out.  Any more conversation will only cloud the issue.
2011-10-19T16:11:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- "sort though" ? waht does it mean?
2011-10-19T16:12:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	Read, follow instructions.
2011-10-19T16:12:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- anyway then yes, I did the second way. I entered using init=/bin/bash , and entered. no passwd, as I said. I am getting a few errors at the end, when booting it up though:
2011-10-19T16:15:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- works!
2011-10-19T16:16:00.000Z	usr13	Saw	Not only does that mean that the filesystem was not recognized.... ok got it..?
2011-10-19T16:16:00.000Z	Saw	usr13	- I checked out the options, used 'mount -a' !
