2005-02-14T13:59:00.000Z	KBJ		Ya! win2k could not even formate my hard drive?
2005-02-14T14:00:00.000Z	KBJ		it was working good when i had Win xp!!
2005-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	KBJ		no not anymore
2005-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	KBJ		i don't believe in dual boot... ;)
2005-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	KBJ		hehe... yep
2005-02-14T14:02:00.000Z	KBJ		a 256 mb swap and a 13 gb reiserfs partition... all made during the ubuntu install
2005-02-14T14:04:00.000Z	KBJ		first boot after the install
2005-02-14T14:04:00.000Z	KBJ		i can boot on a livecd and then chroot into it... but i don't know what to do to fix it...
2005-02-14T14:05:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	...um.  Fix what?
2005-02-14T14:06:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	...I joined in the middle of your comments.
2005-02-14T14:07:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	Ok.  If you're chrooted, you can rerun the grub installer.  So: boot.  cd to /.  'chroot .'
2005-02-14T14:07:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	...at which point you want to google for Grub error 17.  Sure that isn't 15?
2005-02-14T14:08:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	pinfo grub shows 17:   Cannot mount selected partition
2005-02-14T14:08:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	What filesystem for that partition?
2005-02-14T14:08:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	...and are you sure you've got the right root partition specified?
2005-02-14T14:12:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	if you're single-booting, /dev/hda.  if you're mutli-booting, depends on the bootloader you plan to use, but /dev/hda is still possible.
2005-02-14T14:12:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	/dev/hda2 if you plan on using NTLDR.EXE.
2005-02-14T14:15:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	lilo should work with reiserfs.
2005-02-14T14:16:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	It's worth a shot, easy enough to try.
2005-02-14T14:16:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	...and lilo error messages are generally better understood than GRUB.
2005-02-14T14:23:00.000Z	karsten	KBJ	You can fetch DEBs manually and install them.  or chroot into your distro and fetch from within it.
2005-02-14T14:37:00.000Z	KBJ	karsten	you still there?
