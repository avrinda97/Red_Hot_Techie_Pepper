2008-04-04T22:11:00.000Z	Bunjo		Does Visiontek ATI X1650 PRo work on ubuntu 7.10 ?
2008-04-04T22:11:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	it'll work
2008-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	what's the error?
2008-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	when the first screen appears I hit enter (or any other key) to get the live mode running, but I get "err8"
2008-04-04T22:14:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	interesting - do you get to the point where you can format the drive?
2008-04-04T22:14:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	I only get to the first menu where I choose to install run live mode etc.
2008-04-04T22:15:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	so you can't even boot into the live cd?
2008-04-04T22:15:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	: exactly
2008-04-04T22:15:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	and this same system previously had ubuntu installed?
2008-04-04T22:15:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	but the funny thing is, that kubuntu 7.4 runs (I want to change it to ubuntu 7.10)
2008-04-04T22:17:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	I had ubuntu installed (and upgraded to 7.10) but I got this new graphic card, since then it was not working, so I successfully installed kubuntu 7.4 but I want to go back to ubuntu 7.10 and I can't :)
2008-04-04T22:17:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	easy
2008-04-04T22:17:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	install kubuntu
2008-04-04T22:17:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	then do apt-get ubuntu-desktop
2008-04-04T22:18:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	that make sense?
2008-04-04T22:19:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	yes it does, but I am unable to configure my wireless under kubuntu
2008-04-04T22:19:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	there are no wired controllers?
2008-04-04T22:19:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	may have to go wired while you do the desktop upgrade
2008-04-04T22:20:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	OK I guess I would have to move my furniture to get to the dsl router then
2008-04-04T22:21:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	sorry - I can't think of any alternative - it's possible that the desktop upgrade will fail
2008-04-04T22:21:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	Thank you for the help, I shall get back here once I am finished with the upgrade
2008-04-04T22:21:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	The system that I have with a x1650 is a 965 chipset so I can't even install /nix on it
2008-04-04T22:22:00.000Z	Bunjo	xFlipx	Lucky me then
2008-04-04T22:22:00.000Z	xFlipx	Bunjo	good luck :)
