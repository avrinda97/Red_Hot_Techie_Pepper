2008-03-04T13:51:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	whats the error be a bit more specific
2008-03-04T13:54:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	do you still have windows installed?
2008-03-04T13:55:00.000Z	Amir880	Dangermike	i did a restart which would do the same as shutdown
2008-03-04T13:58:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	i need to do some googling but firefox is seg faulting :( trying to look it up now
2008-03-04T14:01:00.000Z	Amir880	Dangermike	any luck?
2008-03-04T14:02:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	lol installing epiphany now
2008-03-04T14:03:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	it would probably be easier to do it via gparted on the live cd
2008-03-04T14:03:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	you will need (want) to create an ext2 or ext3 partition and a swap partition
2008-03-04T14:04:00.000Z	Amir880	Dangermike	im totally lost
2008-03-04T14:04:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	well at least your eager to learn ill find an article that explains it
2008-03-04T14:05:00.000Z	Amir880	Dangermike	is that why its not working? my partition is NTFS
2008-03-04T14:05:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	swap and your ext2/3
2008-03-04T14:08:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	sorry i cannot keep my browser open long enough to read the articles to see if their worth anything to read i would google  'ubuntu ext3 and ntfs' choose the ubuntu forums link theres a wikipedia link and a ubuntu starters guide link
2008-03-04T14:10:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	google the error it came up with results
2008-03-04T14:10:00.000Z	Dangermike	Amir880	i just couldnt read the articles :(
