2006-08-09T09:16:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	what does 'cat /etc/resolv.conf' say? maybe one of your dns servers
2006-08-09T09:16:00.000Z	LethalSword	scrappy_	how do i read that?
2006-08-09T09:17:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	you can just cat it or gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
2006-08-09T09:18:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	i was thinking the first server or two wasnt working and that was causing it to be slow
2006-08-09T09:19:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	maybe do dig google.com
2006-08-09T09:19:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	what server does it say you router or one of the others
2006-08-09T09:21:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	the command 'dig something.com' should respond with dns info and tell you which server it used.  if your router is the server maybe remove the other entries from resolv.conf file.. or vice versa
2006-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	yeah id remove everything but that from resolv.conf and see if web pages are faster
2006-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	or just add a # in front to comment them out
2006-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	im not sure what that is i dont have it in my file
2006-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	np
2006-08-09T09:38:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	youll have to get a wireless card. thats what neighbors are for
2006-08-09T09:39:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	nah as long as you dont login to their router because you need to forward a port so something.. :)
2006-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	scrappy_	LethalSword	you dont have to worry about it is sort of an automatic process in ext3 i think
