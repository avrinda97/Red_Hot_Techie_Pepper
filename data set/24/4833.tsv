2008-03-21T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight		which library allows me to execute sun java 6 thru the firefox browser?
2008-03-21T06:59:00.000Z	xtknight		i am trying to get sun java as a plugin to my firefox but not icedtea or any of the alternatives which seem to fail each time i try them
2008-03-21T06:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	any java install is going to do the plugins right
2008-03-21T06:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	jre package ?
2008-03-21T07:01:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	need to run it in compatibliity mode, see google
2008-03-21T07:04:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	the java plugin isn't available in x64
2008-03-21T08:00:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	no
2008-03-21T08:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	.bash_profile runs only on login shells, .bashrc will run on any shell
2008-03-21T08:17:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	does gdm login constitute a "login shell" then?
2008-03-21T08:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	it does, but it's not bash heh
2008-03-21T08:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	 i mean is bash profile run after logging into gdm?
2008-03-21T08:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	no
2008-03-21T08:35:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	well i hope it was rewarding

2008-03-22T07:00:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	dmraid isn't applicable to him at all
2008-03-22T07:00:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	he's using real hardware raid
2008-07-05T11:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	i'm not sure if there is any way to manually set a cpu frequency like that
2008-07-05T11:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	stop powernowd
2008-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	not sure why you'd want to do that, it's just wasting power, but powernowd is what you want to get rid of
2008-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	i see, that did it
2008-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	it shouldn't be noticable
2008-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	he's using a usb sound card that isn't listed there
2008-07-07T08:16:00.000Z	Fryguy--	xtknight	the device isn't listed
2008-07-07T08:17:00.000Z	xtknight	Fryguy--	hehe i know
