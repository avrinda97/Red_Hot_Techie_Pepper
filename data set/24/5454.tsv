2009-05-11T18:03:00.000Z	dr4g		Hi there i'm trying to add my user to the sudoers list, and have a question. I've been told to add my user account to the 'admin' section but i do'nt want to screw anything up. http://pastie.org/474394 - My user account i wish to add to the sudoers account is 'mediacorp' how should i ammend my /etc/group file accordingly. (see pastebin url)
2009-05-11T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	sudo adduser mediacorp admin
2009-11-23T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	netstat -putan | grep 3306
2009-11-23T20:46:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	can you help me identify if this is listening to external connections ?
2009-11-23T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	127.0.0.1:3306 <<< seems to be listenning in localhost == 127.0.0.1
2009-11-23T20:47:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	is this enough to allow remote MySQL connections? I'm wondering if it's a router or firewall issue to not allow :3306 connections ?
2009-11-23T20:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	no; it should be listening in the LAN ip not in the localhost ip
2009-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	never configured mysql so i dunno where you change the iface/ip it binds to
2009-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	alright thanks for your assistance.
2009-11-23T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	check the main conf file
2009-11-23T20:49:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	i'm there.
2009-11-23T20:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-enable-remote-access-to-mysql-database-server.html is this keyword --> bind-address=YOUR-SERVER-IP
2009-11-23T20:54:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	i've been instructed to comment this line out instead. I think it's my firewall
2009-11-23T20:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	if you just comment out how can mysql know where to bind?
2009-11-23T20:55:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	i'm not sure but the #mysql guys informed me to do that. It must have system defautls.
2009-11-23T20:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	ok
2009-11-23T20:56:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	looks like a firewall issue.
2009-11-23T20:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	did you installed a firwall ? ubuntu has no fw by default
2009-11-23T20:59:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	yes. thanks for your help. c ya
2010-01-14T05:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	super button == windows button on most keyboards
2010-01-14T05:00:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	thankyou.
2011-01-20T01:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	libcurl?
2011-01-20T01:53:00.000Z	dr4g	erUSUL	sorry i thought i was in ##php
2011-01-20T01:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	dr4g	:P
