2006-04-10T11:23:00.000Z	Zoo	eobanb	, did you burn the image right, or are you using the official ubuntu cd?
2006-04-10T11:24:00.000Z	Zoo		also, my friend complained when he uses the 64 version of ubuntu, he told me off, but then he smiled
2006-04-10T11:24:00.000Z	eobanb		zoo: i've tried with a burned 5.10 and a shipped 5.04 and they both dont work
