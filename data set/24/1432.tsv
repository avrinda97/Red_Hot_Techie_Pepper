2010-02-09T23:14:00.000Z	becker_11		Hi I've found a ssh tutorial and it says to enter "ssh yourusername@yourhomeaddress" but I've only got an ip not a domain and I couldn't get it too work
2010-02-09T23:14:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	do this:  ssh yourUserName@yourIPAddress
2010-02-09T23:15:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	silly question but I was entering xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx should I have left out the periods
2010-02-09T23:15:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	no, leave the periods.  for example: ssh Trek@127.0.0.1
2010-02-09T23:16:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	if I were connecting to the right username and computer :P
2010-02-09T23:16:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	okay well when I did that I was getting a cursor blinking but no prompt so I ctrl +c out of it
2010-02-09T23:16:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	shouldn't I have gotten a prompt?
2010-02-09T23:17:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	is port 22 open?  did you install the ssh packages?
2010-02-09T23:17:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	yeah I forwarded port 22 and installed openssh-server
2010-02-09T23:18:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	maybe I haven't actually got it running
2010-02-09T23:18:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 did you reboot your comp?
2010-02-09T23:18:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	no haven't rebooted
2010-02-09T23:19:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 do this in command line: apt-get install --reinstall openssh-server
2010-02-09T23:19:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 it should also find the dependencies
2010-02-09T23:19:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 if that doesn't work, then it might not be installed:  apt-get install openssh-server
2010-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 then accessing it externally is the issue...
2010-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 do you use a firewall on your comp?
2010-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	router
2010-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	no firewall
2010-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 is IP tables blocking incoming traffic?
2010-02-09T23:21:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	if it is I haven't set it up
2010-02-09T23:21:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	 i'll assume its not blocking traffic...
2010-02-09T23:32:00.000Z	Trek	becker_11	perhaps that was the case, wrong IP.  try using the IP on whatismyip.com
2010-02-09T23:34:00.000Z	becker_11	Trek	that ip is incorrect my isp must have a transperant proxy or something I've just got the correct ip from my router config
