2009-03-24T09:25:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	ok thanks just a sec

2009-03-24T09:29:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	btw this thing started after I installed the Compiz thing
2009-03-24T09:30:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	awesome. let's go step-by-step here... let's start by turning compiz off (just put it into regular graphics mode)
2009-03-24T09:31:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	ok done - whoa its back - but no effects?
2009-03-24T09:32:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	so I can't use compiz now? i was planning on showing the desktop bling bling to my sister so i could convince her to use ubuntu
2009-03-24T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	you might want to try changing to something other than stardust (like the default)
2009-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	ok i set theme to Human and then turned on Extra Effects again. Again the window decorator just disappeared...
2009-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	hrm. try this: make a whole new user account, login with it, turn compiz on. does it happen with that account as well?
2009-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	ok I will log into that account, but that would take a while
2009-03-24T09:38:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	brb
2009-03-24T09:56:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	same thing here look: http://img15.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotmeo.png
2009-03-24T09:57:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	also my terminal is blank - i am using xterm, but gnome-terminal is just a white sqaure
2009-03-24T09:57:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	what graphics card and which driver are you using?
2009-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	nvidia geforce 2 mx 400 96 driver from repos
2009-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	got it. i wouldn't recommend using compiz with it.
2009-03-24T09:59:00.000Z	Gnea	whou	the card is too old to support it properly
2009-03-24T10:00:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	pHreaksYcle: but it worked for 2 days
2009-03-24T11:20:00.000Z	whou	Gnea	I have managed to make it work
