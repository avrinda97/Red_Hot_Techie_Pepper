2009-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	H4ck3r		How to change my  /etc/shadow file encryption mode from default SHA2 to MD5?
2009-03-23T07:32:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	doesn't it just use crypt()
2009-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	I know but i dont know what to do next
2009-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	let me read the docs on crypt and I'll get back to you in a sec
2009-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	H4ck3r		thank you
2009-03-23T07:34:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	do you know some general programming?
2009-03-23T07:34:00.000Z	H4ck3r		yes
2009-03-23T07:35:00.000Z	H4ck3r		I mean I want to change the system like this:
2009-03-23T07:35:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	alright so the crypt function takes two arguments, the key and a salt, if the salt starts with $1$ it will use md5
2009-03-23T07:36:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	I can generate a new user passwordwith md5
2009-03-23T07:37:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	what are you trying to do exactly?  be specific
2009-03-23T07:37:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	but what i'm asking now is how to change ubuntu to use only md5 instead of sha2: for example: I typed $passwd and I changed  my password. The new password will be $1$ in /ec/shadow instead of $6$
2009-03-23T07:40:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	do you have a page that says what the difference algorithms are identified as in the shadow file, e.g. $1$ is md5 $6$ is sha2
2009-03-23T07:40:00.000Z	H4ck3r		yes
2009-03-23T07:40:00.000Z	H4ck3r		my system is using $6$ which is SHA2
2009-03-23T07:41:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	I mean how do you know that is sha2?
2009-03-23T07:41:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	I'm not doubting you I'm just looking for a source
2009-03-23T07:41:00.000Z	H4ck3r		I searched on google
2009-03-23T07:46:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	when passwd.c is compiled, there are a bunch of macros that determine what algorithm it uses
2009-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	nvm,  I just figured out we can use chpasswd with -c option to determine which kind of algorithm to be used
2009-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	however , passwd doesnt support this
2009-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	:)
2009-03-23T07:48:00.000Z	nickgarvey	H4ck3r	passwd doesn't support chpasswd or doesn't support the algorithm you want to use?
2009-03-23T07:49:00.000Z	H4ck3r	nickgarvey	passwd doesnot support option for user to specify which encryption method to be used to encrypt the password
