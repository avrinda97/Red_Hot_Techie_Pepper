2005-05-10T12:45:00.000Z	zxc		Yeah it sucks as I need it for BBC radio but nothing I can do. But it's affecting my browsers so I need to unistall it but I can't >_<.
2005-05-10T12:45:00.000Z	sig	zxc	yes you can
2005-05-10T12:45:00.000Z	sig		how did you install it?
2005-05-10T12:45:00.000Z	sig		via the ubuntuguide.org howto?
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	zxc	sig	I did it using the .bin
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	sig		do you still have the .bin file
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	zxc		does that mean it works for AMD64? As the forums say it doesn't
2005-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	sig		there should be a switch for that .bin to uninstall
2005-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	zxc		hmm, it doesn't work now
2005-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	sig		try: ./realplayerblah.bin --uninstall
2005-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	zxc	sig	how would I do it if the realplayer bin is in my home dir?
2005-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	sig		do it there
2005-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	sig		first I'd open synaptic and search for "realplayer"
2005-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	sig		sometimes synaptic recognizes that stuff
2005-05-10T12:50:00.000Z	sig		it it does, select it for uninstallation
2005-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	zxc		what would my home dir be?
2005-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	sig		 /home/name
2005-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	sig		name being your username
2005-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	sig		sudo -s
2005-05-10T12:52:00.000Z	sig		try that
2005-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	sig		because by ubuntu default su is off
2005-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	zxc		Bob@ubuntu:~$ /home/perminder RealPlayer10GOLD.bin --unistall
2005-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	zxc		bash: /home/Bob: is a directory
2005-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	sig	zxc	just cd to it
