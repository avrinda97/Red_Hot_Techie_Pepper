2012-04-14T00:25:00.000Z	thundx	jola	looks like your disk is bad
2012-04-14T00:36:00.000Z	thundx	jola	you familiar with dd ?
2012-04-14T00:36:00.000Z	jola	thundx	I only know that it does raw copy
2012-04-14T00:37:00.000Z	jola	thundx	but how can I copy from it if I can't mount it?
2012-04-14T00:39:00.000Z	jola	thundx	how long is it supposed to take? it runs for more than 10 secs now
2012-04-14T00:39:00.000Z	jola	thundx	ssta, it's a 53GB partition on a 160GB drive
2012-04-14T00:40:00.000Z	jola	thundx	is it 512 MB? or byte?
2012-04-14T00:41:00.000Z	jola	thundx	but why does that depend on the partition size?
2012-04-14T00:41:00.000Z	jola	thundx	how long it takes
2012-04-14T00:43:00.000Z	jola	thundx	ssta, so how long should I wait until I know if it hangs? (the partition is 80GB)
2012-04-14T00:44:00.000Z	jola	thundx	why pipe it to /dev/null though. wouldn't it be better to save it in a file?
2012-04-14T00:44:00.000Z	jola	thundx	what amount of "blocks copied" could be considered kosher after x minutes?
2012-04-14T00:53:00.000Z	jola	thundx	it's a xp partition
2012-04-14T00:58:00.000Z	jola	thundx	there are 61 GB used on the external disk. it's vfat
2012-04-14T01:00:00.000Z	jola	thundx	a second partition on the external drive? with gparted?
2012-04-14T01:04:00.000Z	jola	thundx	wtf, gparted says "unable to find mount point" but for the external drive!! /dev/sdb1
2012-04-14T01:05:00.000Z	jola	thundx	yes
2012-04-14T01:12:00.000Z	jola	thundx	I quit gparted, unmounted the external disk, started gparted, but now it's "Searching /dev/sdb partitions..." since minutes
2012-04-14T01:16:00.000Z	jola	thundx	what should I do, mount it and try to reformat?
2012-04-14T01:21:00.000Z	thundx	jola	if you don't need the data on the drive, then yeah that's what I would do
2012-04-14T01:21:00.000Z	jola	thundx	I do need it
2012-04-14T01:21:00.000Z	jola	thundx	it doesn't mount :/
2012-04-14T01:24:00.000Z	jola	thundx	ok, I mounted it successfully on /mnt, gparted doesn't complain anymore. can I create a new 85GB partition in the free space? is it contiguous?
2012-04-14T01:31:00.000Z	jola	thundx	will removing the partition delete the data? can I remove the partition and create a new one over the old data?
