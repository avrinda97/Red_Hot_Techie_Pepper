2012-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	the_dark_knight		Hi, how do I restart a process immediately after it get aborted, like restarting it after reboot. I want some of my process to be allways up and running. I am talking about the gearman workers (prcesses) if anybody know gearman. Please help, I have been searching for it for a long time and I have lost hope.
2012-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	are you using upstart to manage it?
2012-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	I don't know upstart. Is it some program?
2012-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	upstart is ubunut's init daemon
2012-10-31T13:47:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	how do you start this gearman software?
2012-10-31T13:47:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	but it will be only for the reboot condition. what for the fail/abort
2012-10-31T13:48:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	you have to install gearmand first and start the gearmand daemon like gearmand -d
2012-10-31T13:48:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	upstart provides facilities to respawn processes (see "respawn" in the upstart cookbook)
2012-10-31T13:49:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	Started reading respawn and upstart hold on.
2012-10-31T13:51:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	anyway, the other options I know about are daemontools and just using a "while true; do COMMAND; done" loop.  upstart is probably the "nicest" way I know about
2012-10-31T13:52:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	started readin the man page for upstart and it looks goood
2012-10-31T13:52:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/
2012-10-31T14:04:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	Slart, I think the upstart or init is for the reboots and respawn is to restart after every abort. Also I don't have /etc/inittab what do I need for this?
2012-10-31T14:04:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	Slart, respawn looks promising
2012-10-31T14:04:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	"respawn" is something you can add to an init job configuration.  I don't know why you are looking for /etc/inittab
2012-10-31T14:06:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9072879/how-to-use-linux-software-watchdog this link was given to me by Slart . I was referring to it from the discussion on this links
2012-10-31T14:06:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	ubuntu uses upstart, read the upstart docs
2012-10-31T14:08:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	you can ask the #upstart guys if upstart will respect the "respawn" lines in /etc/inittab but I doubt it
2012-10-31T14:08:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	thus why I said you would need to create an upstart job and include "respawn" in it.  See the upstart cookbook for examples of this
2012-11-01T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	you need to enable user jobs in upstart
2012-11-01T16:36:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	not getting you.
2012-11-01T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	upstart isn't configured to check user's ~/.init by default in ubuntu
2012-11-01T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	the_dark_knight	afaik
2012-11-01T16:37:00.000Z	the_dark_knight	jrib	modified .conf file http://www.bpaste.net/raw/i2Fs9WlAWgkzeAH3gz3e/. log prints it till " just before starting the worker"
