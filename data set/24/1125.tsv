2011-11-22T05:41:00.000Z	slgma		anyone know why some windows arent themed in XFCE (like brasero for example)
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	Artemis3	slgma	perhaps its using gtk3? you should avoid brasero and use xfburn... seriously.
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	slgma		xfburn doesnt work for me
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	slgma		just spins my disk really loudly and doesnt ever stop
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	slgma		i prefer gnome programs Artemis
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	slgma		thunar isnt bad
2011-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	Artemis3	slgma	your call, my experience with brasero has been the complete opposite.
2011-11-22T05:43:00.000Z	slgma		brasero is extremely stable for me
2011-11-22T05:43:00.000Z	slgma		rarely ever fails
2011-11-22T05:43:00.000Z	slgma		xfburn sounded like it was gonna burn up my disk drive
2011-11-22T05:44:00.000Z	slgma		gnome-baker is good too
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	Artemis3	slgma	should be a problem with wodim, after all xfburn is a simple front end, much like gnomebaker used to be. brasero on the other hand... takes over the drive, if brasero ever crashes, goodbye to burning (or reading) until restart, that was my experience with it. Oh, and doesn't play along with k3b either
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	slgma		so how do i change the gtk theme from xfce? i want brasero and nautilus to look the same as everything else
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	slgma		i hate k3b
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	slgma		and all things KDE
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	slgma		KDE is the worst thing to happen to linux since unity
2011-11-22T05:45:00.000Z	slgma		even though KDE was first
2011-11-22T05:46:00.000Z	Artemis3	slgma	in Appearances you change the gtk2 theme...
2011-11-22T05:46:00.000Z	slgma		doesnt work for me
2011-11-22T05:47:00.000Z	slgma	Artemis3	it doesnt effect the gtk apps when im using xfce
2011-11-22T05:48:00.000Z	slgma		it did in ubuntu 11.04
2011-11-22T05:48:00.000Z	slgma		ever since unity became part of ubuntu, upgrades have been hell
2011-11-22T05:48:00.000Z	slgma		all kinds of stuff messes up and stops working
2011-11-22T05:49:00.000Z	Artemis3	slgma	are you sure its not only a few apps like you said? is leafpad and friends not changing appeareance?
