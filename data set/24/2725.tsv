2010-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	Coolslai		its so cofuzzling

2010-10-14T13:11:00.000Z	Coolslai		i have it installed and running fine... i just need i tsetup
2010-10-14T13:12:00.000Z	Coolslai		i have nero i think
2010-10-14T13:12:00.000Z	Coolslai		wbut i dont have the iso
2010-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	Coolslai		i download and its WinRar
2010-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	that's because winrar associate with .iso file
2010-10-14T13:13:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	forget winrar and just burn it with a image burning software
2010-10-14T13:14:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	for your own good, change Windows file explorer preferences to not to hide known filename extension
2010-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	those you get from http://ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download  are ISO   (disc image)
2010-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	WinRar is involved here because when you install WinRar, you tell it to be the default application to handle ISO too
2010-10-14T13:15:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	but winrar could only extract ISO,  not burning to disc
2010-10-14T13:18:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	you don't have to redownload.... it is just WinRar registers itself as the default application to handle ISO
2010-10-14T13:18:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	seriously, set not to hide file name extension in explorer,  it helps
2010-10-14T13:19:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	screw winrar
2010-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	kai696 you don't "unrar" an ISO... but extract it.   WinRar could extract ISO, yes/
2010-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	do you want to burn to disc or what?
2010-10-14T13:22:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	use USB drive then
2010-10-14T13:25:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	you could dual boot
2010-10-14T13:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	Coolslai	tell wubi to use the iso you just downloaded (which is itself)
