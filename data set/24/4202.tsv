2007-06-10T14:48:00.000Z	tom_24		Hey Guys! I have been playing with ubuntu on my spare HDD (about 10GB) but want to transfer ubuntu only my master drive (more space, etc) Any tools or tips anyone has for this task?
2007-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	tom_24		Phixnay - guess your still stuck in the same position? Am i best just re-formatting and starting over you think? =(
2007-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	no, it's definitely doable, and I've done it, I just don't know the best way
2007-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	Ok - guess i will have to do a little more snooping about - any ideas at all where i should start?
2007-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	I started moving the files with the command line, but I got impatient and ended it right it the middle of what it was doing - that wasn't too smart : )
2007-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	I'm sure the people in here know, you just have to be a little patient for someone to notice
2007-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	heh - i bed that caused a few issues =/
2007-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	lol it did :).
2007-06-10T14:57:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	Thanks Man - i shall keep the hunt on - if i get anyhthing il let you know =)
2007-06-10T14:57:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	ok, good luck
2007-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	I thought of a solution for you
2007-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	oh?
2007-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	you could install ubuntu from scratch on your hdd, then copy your directories from your old one
2007-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	you could also create a separate partition for /home
2007-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	good idea- only problem is (i could be wrong) i will lose all my settings (I just got my ATI card playing ball - im sure you have heard of the horror stories?"
2007-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	yeah, I'd hate to go through all the configuration on this computer again as well :)
2007-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	if I'm correct, though, most of it is kept in /etc
2007-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	yeah
2007-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	i think you have just wiped out my entire afternoon tommorow :)
2007-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	I guess your safest route would be to keep checking back in here for someone who's done this kind of thing before
2007-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	lol, just a suggestion (and probably not a very good one)
2007-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	that I can help you with
2007-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	phixnay	tom_24	use gparted, it's good
2007-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	tom_24	phixnay	- Thanks =D *downloads*
