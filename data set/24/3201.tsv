2010-05-18T23:50:00.000Z	Darkstep		When installing Ubuntu on windows what's the difference between the installation sizes ?
2010-05-18T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	you mean Wubi?
2010-05-18T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	Wubi is ok for short term Ubuntu useage, when it works,  in the long run a proper partitioned install is better :)
2010-05-18T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	if I remember correctly to do with perfromance/speed
2010-05-18T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	the Wubi installer will probably mention that in fact, well did when I tried to do Wubi just to try not that long ago.  Also when it comes to data
2010-05-18T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	if your install mess's up not so easy to get to,  if you done a partitioned install, just stick in Live CD,  access the partition and get hold of the data
2010-05-18T23:52:00.000Z	Darkstep	sebsebseb	I see.
2010-05-18T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	then of course if Windows messes up enough, Wubi will also mess up.  Also if Windows hasn't been disk defragmented for a long time, that can slow down Wubi/Ubuntu
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	well as far as I know for that last thing.
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	Darkstep	sebsebseb	I'm afraid of dual booting, cuz' of problems with grub
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	Oh? what kind of problems? What problems?
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	Darkstep	sebsebseb	its hard to remove Ubuntu froam a dual boot
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	not that difficult
2010-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	delete the Ubuntu partition,  then let the Windows CD/DVD  do it's thing ot hte MBR
2010-05-18T23:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	there seems to be another way using a command instead of Windows CD, but I don't know the details
2010-05-18T23:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	Have you tired Ubuntu before?
2010-05-18T23:54:00.000Z	Darkstep	sebsebseb	Can you point me to somewhere ?
2010-05-18T23:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	so put it on a dual boot?
2010-05-18T23:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	most properly experienced users will recommend against Wubi
2010-05-18T23:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	or so it seems anyway
2010-05-19T00:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	I understand that your a bit worried about something happening so you  suddenly can't boot up XP,  however maybe you don't need WIndows at all.  There are alternatives for most Windows only apps that are any good.  You can run quite a lot of stuff in Wine as well.
2010-05-19T00:01:00.000Z	Darkstep	sebsebseb	I need Windows for programming
2010-05-19T00:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	plus if you don't  use Windows,  or at least not a pshyical install,  you get security advantages,  If your RAM can handle it and such, you can virtual machine Windows inside Ubuntu for most apps.
2010-05-19T00:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Darkstep	need WIndows  for programming ?
