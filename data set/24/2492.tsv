2010-08-26T04:48:00.000Z	cromag		Hello, i am trying to get boxee running whilst no monitor is plugged into my Ubuntu box. I've tried a couple of small things with xorg.conf but i do not seem to be successfull. Is there a way to trick X (i believe the problem lies there) to think there IS a monitor and run in $resolution mode ? (does it all make sense ?)
2010-08-26T04:49:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	how do you expect that to work? what's not working?
2010-08-26T04:49:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	use remote desktopping?
2010-08-26T04:49:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	my x tells me it goes to failsafe mode
2010-08-26T04:49:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	i use wine for remote desktop, i got that working with tweaking xorg.conf - boxee just wont run.
2010-08-26T04:50:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	can you set up a remote desktop? and view the desktop to run boxee that way, and why do you wanna run it without a screen?
2010-08-26T04:50:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	it wont run, i tried that.
2010-08-26T04:50:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	wine? what?
2010-08-26T04:51:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	i want to run it because i'm at work, and the monitor is off now. (and wine = teamviewer IN wine sorry)
2010-08-26T04:51:00.000Z	cromag		and i want to work with it
2010-08-26T04:52:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	well try getting a native thing going for a remote desktop server, and also boxee in work? I can't commend that...
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	cromag		i believe the problem is the lack of 3d or glx, which wont start without monitor.
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	cromag		the remote dekstopping is not a need to have at this point
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	can't you leave the monitor lugged in?
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	mickster04		plugged*
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	cromag		it's off, but plugged in.
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	mickster04		ok
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	mickster04		humm
2010-08-26T04:53:00.000Z	cromag		fg
2010-08-26T04:54:00.000Z	mickster04	cromag	when it says it goes into failsafe does it say why?
2010-08-26T04:54:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	yes, it misses a screen /device
2010-08-26T04:55:00.000Z	mickster04		oh yeah...
2010-08-26T04:55:00.000Z	mickster04		ermmm..thats beyond my capabilities..but it relates to how ubunbtu handles monitors turning off... its some clever stuff to make sure ubuntu doesn't craswh basically
2010-08-26T04:56:00.000Z	cromag	mickster04	yeah, i believe thats why BulletProffX was invented :)
