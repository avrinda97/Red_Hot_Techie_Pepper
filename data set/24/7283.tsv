2005-03-04T06:06:00.000Z	silverbirch		I can't see what swap is using - but then I am not familiar withthis stuff
2005-03-04T06:07:00.000Z	silverbirch		df -h gave me hda1 at 11 Gb which is more than I remember trying to give it
2005-03-04T06:08:00.000Z	silverbirch		df -h gave me hda1 19G - somewhat more than I thought I had allocated
2005-03-04T06:08:00.000Z	silverbirch		doesn't chat work while a konsole open?
2005-03-04T06:10:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	chat with a konsole .., what do you mean
2005-03-04T06:20:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	OK, have you experienced hardware problems already
2005-03-04T06:20:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- yes -using mandrake 10.1 for two weeks - Sony DSC-W1 not supported, and Canon 3000F not supported.
2005-03-04T06:23:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- that is what I was led tobelieve - that it is posibble to use them - but I am new to linux
2005-03-04T06:31:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	it may, I have never trusted a linux installer to auto add another distro, it will add windows, but mandrake may dissappear, partitions can get a bit scary too
2005-03-04T06:32:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- I just hate to be without my computer if anything goes wrong
2005-03-04T06:34:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- okay thanks
2005-03-04T07:17:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	I presume there is no free space on the drive
2005-03-04T07:20:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	mcc will have those tools
2005-03-04T07:21:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- only time I used mcc was with line by line instructions from a LUG person
2005-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	but its a graphical tool :)
2005-03-04T07:28:00.000Z	bascule	silverbirch	er didn't quite understand the last question. On a side note the <tab> key does nick completion .. :))
2005-03-04T07:29:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- I was following your last comments - whcih I thin were related to another post - it is my extreme ignorance which causes this!
2005-03-04T07:33:00.000Z	silverbirch	bascule	- time will tell!
