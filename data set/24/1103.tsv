2010-07-16T10:59:00.000Z	YunIntegral		can i run Adobe PhotoShop CS3 in my ubuntu?
2010-07-16T10:59:00.000Z	YunIntegral		except use VirtualBox
2010-07-16T10:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	in Wine probably
2010-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	uhmm I think you may have to configure Photoshop CS3 before it works well in Wine, not exactly sure
2010-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	YunIntegral	sebsebseb	thx :)
2010-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	appdb tends to not be that up to date, from what I have seen, but could be useful
2010-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	no probls, good luck
2010-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	altough Gimp is pretty good, when you know how to use it properly
2010-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	also there is a single window user mode for the development version
2010-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	and you might find Inkscape useful for something as well
2010-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	YunIntegral	sebsebseb	i also use it
2010-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	What kind of graphics are you making?
2010-07-16T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	For what kind of website?
2010-07-16T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	well if its a good enough site,  and interesting, maybe give me the link :D
2010-07-16T11:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	oh so the website won't be in English? whats it about?
2010-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/07/paintnet-clone-pinta-04-released.html
2010-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	if you know Paint.NET from Windows, well its like that
2010-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	no
2010-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	differnet types of graphics programs
2010-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	I know this is for kids really, but  Tuxpaint is one of the best drawing programs for Desktop Linux :)  has nice ready to use images as well
2010-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	no
2010-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	its an alternative to Paint.net which is quite popular in Windows
2010-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	I woudn't compare either of those programs to Photoshop like airtonix is doing
2010-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	YunIntegral	Pinta hasn't been around for that long, but by the sounds of it is a good program,  you will find that Photoshop can do much more though
