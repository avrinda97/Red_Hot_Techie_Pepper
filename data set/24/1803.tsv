2010-01-15T09:07:00.000Z	user123		how can I modify grub2 so that I can allow more time to select the OS before booting
2010-01-15T09:08:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	try installing package startupmanager
2010-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	do you know if its possible to install it offline?
2010-01-15T09:10:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	well, you will have to dl it from internet, but if you can't i'll tell you how to do it by editing grub's menu.lst
2010-01-15T09:11:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	please tell me how to do it by editing the menu.lst
2010-01-15T09:13:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	press alt+f2 and enter this "gksu gedit /etc/default/grub"
2010-01-15T09:17:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	ok, then?
2010-01-15T09:20:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	there is a line "GRUB_DEFAULT = 0", is this the line I need to modify?
2010-01-15T09:22:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	no, you have to modify the line that begins with "GRUB_TIMEOUT" and change the value to the number of seconds you want
2010-01-15T09:24:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	its done, but the problem is that I have windows and ubuntu installed both at the same time, but it access ubuntu directly and it is not showing the booting menu
2010-01-15T09:24:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	it already has the GRUB_TIMEOUT = 10
2010-01-15T09:25:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	if you want it to show the menu then change GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT from 0 to a number of seconds
2010-01-15T09:26:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	also you can change GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET from true to false, to show a countdown
2010-01-15T09:27:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	thank you
2010-01-15T09:28:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	dont forget to run in a terminal "sudo update-grub" or the changes won't take effect
2010-01-15T09:28:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	thank you
2010-01-15T09:38:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	ir didn't work, it only shows a conuntdown
2010-01-15T09:40:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	i'm sorry, didn't you wanted a delay? maybe i didn't understood correctly
2010-01-15T09:41:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	well, yes, thats what I thought the problem was, but now I see it isnt
2010-01-15T09:42:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	then what is it?
2010-01-15T09:43:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	well, I am not familiar with grub2. I cannot see the screen with the options where I can select the OS and boot it
2010-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	i'm not very familiar with grub2 either, i'm used to grub1. run the gsku gedit /etc/default/grub again to check if all is in order
2010-01-15T09:49:00.000Z	user123	hattoricaca	Yeah, I already did this but everything seems to be fine
2010-01-15T09:50:00.000Z	hattoricaca	user123	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 says the menu won't show unless GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT is commented with a # character at the beginning of the line
