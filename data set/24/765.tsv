2011-01-31T19:37:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	so run it in wine
2011-01-31T19:37:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	it's a security camera
2011-01-31T19:37:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	yes, and it has a make/model
2011-01-31T19:37:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	you can't get it off of the camera itself?
2011-01-31T19:38:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	from strings player.exe i get at the end of file TibetSystem.DVR
2011-01-31T19:39:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	try it like this:  strings -a player.exe | less
2011-01-31T19:39:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	tried vbox with record my desktop but it doesn't show anything but blank
2011-01-31T19:39:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	it has DRM
2011-01-31T19:40:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	tried strings filename.exe | grep -i drm with no output
2011-01-31T19:41:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	no, I mean that it is using Digital Rights Management, so you cannot record the video using a screencapture unless you record it outside of vbox
2011-01-31T19:42:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	tried also in windows and it has some sort of Digital Rights Managment because in windows it records a blank screen
2011-01-31T19:42:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	then don't record it in windows
2011-01-31T19:42:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	somehow the player passes the driver or something so the recording program cannot capture it
2011-01-31T19:43:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	this the files objdump -x , http://pastebin.com/SYAk3XJ7
2011-01-31T19:43:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	yeah, that's not going to work
2011-01-31T19:47:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	see, you just legitimized what we said.
2011-01-31T19:47:00.000Z	Gnea	MichaelDobrovits	sorry for your friend's loss, not sure why someone would want to steal a dog in the first place.
2011-01-31T19:50:00.000Z	MichaelDobrovits	Gnea	that's what i said when it happened. it's not even a special breed it's just some mix, anyway thank you all.
