2008-08-30T07:10:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	have you gotten songs on your ipod at all?
2008-08-30T07:11:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	yes
2008-08-30T07:12:00.000Z	outbriber		so when you try to play the songs on your ipod on your computer, Amarok freezes?
2008-08-30T07:12:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	yes
2008-08-30T07:13:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	Hmm. Since it would be playing the songs over wifi (the only way as of yet with the iPod Touch), chances are it is just really slow.
2008-08-30T07:13:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	When I load songs onto mine, whatever program freezes for a while while it loads, it does everything very slowly over wifi
2008-08-30T07:13:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	so, what do you suggest? because these songs don't play at all
2008-08-30T07:14:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	Can you copy them back from the ipod onto the computer? That would make them play faster.
2008-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	Streaming the songs from the ipod over wifi (for some reason the ipod's wifi is pretty slow) is always going to be pretty slow.
2008-08-30T07:15:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	but, they have very awkward names
2008-08-30T07:17:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	making them hard to copy to the computer or you just don't want them on the computer?
2008-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	i could, but i prefer to use the ipod-touch.  But, if this is the only way it will suffice.
2008-08-30T07:19:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	It should work eventually, it will probably 'skip' as it loads the next bit.  You said it freezes when you generate a playlist, does it freeze trying to play a single song?
2008-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	I'm trying to copy the music over from a second partition now, but its erroring up as I'm copying it. Any idea why?
2008-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	What is the error?
2008-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	permission to read. Duh, that explains it. now how to fix that.
2008-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	i can play the music though
2008-08-30T07:22:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	So you can play the music from the ipod now?
2008-08-30T07:23:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	no i can play the music over from my second partition, but i would still like it copied over into banshee or  amarok
2008-08-30T07:23:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	Is the second partition on your hdd or is the second partition the ipod?
2008-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	hdd
2008-08-30T07:25:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	I don't know all that much about hdd partitions, so I'm not sure how to get music from there to amarok on your first partition
2008-08-30T07:26:00.000Z	Hika42	outbriber	okay, thanks for your help anyways i'll play around with it somemore
2008-08-30T07:27:00.000Z	outbriber	Hika42	np
