2008-05-11T23:18:00.000Z	gaintsura		anyone know why thunderbird says its running, when its really not?
2008-05-11T23:19:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	cos it is running, open a terminal and type "top" then press the letter "u" then type your username - you can then type "k" and kill your instances of thunderbird by putting in the numbers on the left hand side of the screen
2008-05-11T23:22:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	its not in there
2008-05-11T23:22:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	mozilla-thunder
2008-05-11T23:23:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	it is not in there at all
2008-05-11T23:23:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	type q to leave top
2008-05-11T23:23:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	type killall thunderbird
2008-05-11T23:24:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	'no process killed'
2008-05-11T23:24:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	then it is not running
2008-05-11T23:24:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	when I type thunderbird into the console or try to run it from the desktop.. it says thunderbird is running but not responding, please kill thunderbird or reboot your system.. I've rebooted, but it still says the same thing
2008-05-11T23:27:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	do this ps auwx > foo and paste that output into http://paste.ubuntu.com and gove me the url
2008-05-11T23:27:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	hold, pasting
2008-05-11T23:28:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11473/
2008-05-11T23:28:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	give me a moment please
2008-05-11T23:29:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	np, take your time
2008-05-11T23:31:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	do me a favour try to start it from a command prompt and read the contents of that terminal rather than the error onscreen
2008-05-11T23:31:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	no output to terminal, just an error window as I described earlier
2008-05-11T23:32:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	and all it says is that you should choose what?
2008-05-11T23:33:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	'Thunderbird is already running, but not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the exsisting thunderbird process, or restart your system
2008-05-11T23:34:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-05-11T23:36:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	I'm on 8.04
2008-05-11T23:36:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	that is like there is a lock file but that does not make sense
2008-05-11T23:37:00.000Z	gaintsura	ompaul	I know, hence my confusion
2008-05-11T23:41:00.000Z	ompaul	gaintsura	how about this ls -a | less find the directory for thunderbird cd into the "profile" remove the lock file there
