2007-05-04T15:04:00.000Z	Ace2016	jay__	remove the kernel your trying to install now, and the oldest kernel you have installed, don't touch the one your using now
2007-05-04T15:11:00.000Z	Ace2016	jay__	very bad idea
2007-05-04T15:11:00.000Z	Ace2016	jay__	very very bad
2007-05-04T15:11:00.000Z	Ace2016	jay__	almost insane
2007-05-04T15:12:00.000Z	Ace2016	jay__	go there and check you have at least one kernel remaining
