2011-12-15T12:44:00.000Z	srfc21		I need some help installed rubygems 1.8.12 on Ubuntu 10.10
2011-12-15T12:44:00.000Z	srfc21		I ran the updater and now all the files in /var/lib/gems/1.8 have disappeared.
2011-12-15T12:45:00.000Z	srfc21		removing and reinstalling the package using aptitude will not resolve.
2011-12-15T12:46:00.000Z	srfc21		but that didn't help either. Also tried aptitude reinstall rubygems.
2011-12-15T12:47:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	are you building a development machine or a production one?
2011-12-15T12:47:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	production
2011-12-15T12:48:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	have your tried rvm?
2011-12-15T12:48:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	rvm yields "command not found"
2011-12-15T12:49:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	nope rvm is a ruby version management app
2011-12-15T12:49:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	separate package install?
2011-12-15T12:50:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ its very safe on multi version of rubies
2011-12-15T12:51:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	Yikes, there's no way to resolve this using the native package management tools?
2011-12-15T12:51:00.000Z	srfc21		I would be happy just to get my /var/lib/gems/1.8 files back..
2011-12-15T12:52:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	You can delete the ruby folder under /usr/local/lib/
2011-12-15T12:52:00.000Z	srfc21		I've got /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8 and /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1
2011-12-15T12:54:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	yap that's the installation path of ruby you can delete that and under /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin delete file ruby and other ruby executables
2011-12-15T12:54:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	and then what, reinstall the rubygems distro package?
2011-12-15T12:55:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	yap but i prefer using the rvm tool
2011-12-15T12:55:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	alright, thanks for the rvm tool tip, I'll give that a shot and then go nuclear if necessary.
2011-12-15T12:56:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	no prob mate welcome
2011-12-15T12:56:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	One more quick question: is it normal to have these sorts of version problems with Ruby on Ubuntu?
2011-12-15T12:57:00.000Z	srfc21	devkorcvince	Or did I screw something up from the initial install?
2011-12-15T12:57:00.000Z	srfc21		I was originally just trying to get a diaspora pod up and running on an Ubuntu 10.10 VPS using these docs https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-on-Ubuntu
2011-12-15T13:00:00.000Z	devkorcvince	srfc21	yap ubuntu can't support multi ruby version
