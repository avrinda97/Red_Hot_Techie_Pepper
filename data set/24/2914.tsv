2008-06-28T04:24:00.000Z	bibi__		Can I install ubuntu withouth altering existing partition table?
2008-06-28T04:24:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	no
2008-06-28T04:25:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	Jordan_U: I have another linux distro. and I want ubuntu to be installed on /dev/sda7 , other partitions unchanged.
2008-06-28T04:26:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	so you have a prepared place for it?
2008-06-28T04:27:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	if that is the case then still no unless you also have prepared a swap space
2008-06-28T04:29:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	it will still alter existing partition table, which was your question
2008-06-28T04:29:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	so there is just no way
2008-06-28T04:31:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	if you prepared (PRE) a space for /, and for swap, then yes and no,,, no only by technicality
2008-06-28T04:33:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	if you had set up for prior, then the partition table is "changed" but to the way you designed
2008-06-28T04:35:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	not sure what you are really asking,,, so i am being direct to your question
2008-06-28T04:35:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	I do not care about other OS (if it is bootable afterwards or no). I just want to install ubuntu say on /dev/sda7 and preserve data thatas on /dev/sda8 withouth having to backup.
2008-06-28T04:37:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	You mean if I had a free space instead of /dev/sda7 I could install ubuntu there withouth touching /dev/sda8?
2008-06-28T04:40:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	no, not what i  mean
2008-06-28T04:42:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	and yes,,, but would change the partition table that was your original question
2008-06-28T04:42:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	jordan_U: basically what I want is following. right now I have two partitions /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8. my home (GBs of data) is mounted on /dev/sda8 everything else (/etc /boot /log ...) is on /dev/sda7.  I want to install ubuntu on /dev/sda7 and I want all the data to be left untouched on /dev/sda8 (mount it later as my home directory). Is it doable with ubuntu installer or would I have to backup entyre home directory and write it bac
2008-06-28T04:42:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	but that leaves the question,, where do you install grub?
2008-06-28T04:44:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	yes do-able, never advisable without backup,, but yes
2008-06-28T04:54:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	alternate cd has more config options in install
2008-06-28T04:59:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	If I created some free space on my device, would I be able to install ubuntu there and mount already existing ext3 partitions afterwards?
2008-06-28T05:04:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	ok, example only!,,, i have a 160gb hd mounted as /home,, another 160gb hd mounted as /var, which are both in the file-system
2008-06-28T05:06:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	I have both partitions on the same hd. I guess my only option is to make the actual backup.
2008-06-28T05:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	well, i would suggest that anyway, but, you seem to know what you are doing , and if you know for sure where to install and what to mount others as,,, well its up to you,,,
2008-06-28T05:11:00.000Z	bibi__	SeaPhor	thanks
2008-06-28T05:12:00.000Z	SeaPhor	bibi__	i hope i helped,,, you can find me in #SeaPhor or #Digital-it
