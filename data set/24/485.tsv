2011-08-11T07:46:00.000Z	evan_		hey everyone. I just downloaded an update from update manager this morning for adobe flash 64 plugin, and now I am having problems with flash player.
2011-08-11T07:47:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	 downloaded from where?
2011-08-11T07:47:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	ubuntu update manager
2011-08-11T07:48:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	using firefox?
2011-08-11T07:48:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	yes firefox
2011-08-11T07:49:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	linuxuz3r go into firefox  tools tab and addons and search for "flash aid" install it and then run the wizard it will fix your problems
2011-08-11T07:52:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	I just tried that and still no fix. It actually froze now when I tried a youtube video
2011-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	did you run the wizard ?
2011-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	yes. I am running stable flash version to see if that helps
2011-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	I tried wizard like it said but just froze
2011-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	you may need to kill everything else ... then run the wizard
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	ok I ran quick mode and selected install stable flash and now it works :)
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	that is the only work around i have found as of right now for flash on a X64 system
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	so it did help :)
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	yea it works. thank you sir :)
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	 no problem glad i could help :)
2011-08-11T07:55:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	I think it downgraded it but atleast it works now
2011-08-11T07:56:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	they are working on a stable version for the X64
2011-08-11T07:56:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	ya I guess i better wait before I try installing it from the update manager
2011-08-11T07:57:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	i'm just going to wait till "flash aid" says it's stable lol
2011-08-11T07:57:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	good idea lol
2011-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	a thought.... you may want to go back to the package manager... uninstall that one and then run flash aid again to see if it can install the X64
2011-08-11T08:01:00.000Z	evan_	Blade20	I see here in the package manager that I have flashplugin-installer checked and there is a flashplugin64-install at version 11.0.1.98 not installed
2011-08-11T08:02:00.000Z	Blade20	evan_	you may want to give that a try then.... most it will do is mess up and you uninstall it
