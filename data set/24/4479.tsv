2007-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	deCon		do i NEED to backup my /home if it has its own partition while upgrading to Feisty
2007-04-20T10:49:00.000Z	billy	deCon	always a good idea.  :_
2007-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	deCon	billy	where to ?
2007-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	deCon	billy	necessary...or can i squeeze through
2007-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	billy	deCon	to a DVD.  :)
2007-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	deCon	billy	will it overwrite it?
2007-04-20T10:50:00.000Z	billy	deCon	just be really sure to read everything carefully, as in, don't tell it to format /home.  :)
2007-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	deCon	billy	i had a feeling it would be smart. Yay Ubuntu!
2007-04-20T10:51:00.000Z	billy	deCon	no.  it won't be overwritten.  It's smart, but you have to tell it that /media/sda2 is to be mounted on /home.
2007-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	deCon	billy	qua? why sda2?
2007-04-20T10:53:00.000Z	billy	deCon	well, honestly that was only an example.  it may read something different.  but you need to know the device name of your /home partition.  sudo fdisk -l in terminal.
2007-04-20T10:55:00.000Z	deCon	billy	you mean /dev/sda2 or media/sda2?
2007-04-20T10:56:00.000Z	billy	deCon	by default, Feisty will want to mount your current /home partition to /media/sda2.  There will be a point int the install process when you will be able to change the mount point to /home.
2007-04-20T11:51:00.000Z	billy	deCon	what you're wanting to do is called a "Knoppix install."
2007-04-20T11:51:00.000Z	deCon	billy	whys that?
2007-04-20T11:52:00.000Z	billy	deCon	boot from iso image.
2007-04-20T11:52:00.000Z	deCon	billy	update is working :D.
2007-04-20T11:54:00.000Z	deCon	billy	how can i boot from iso, this is taking too long
2007-04-20T11:55:00.000Z	billy	deCon	you're upgrading now?
2007-04-20T11:55:00.000Z	deCon	billy	trying, however it is stuck on 48 of 70 pieces
2007-04-20T11:56:00.000Z	deCon	billy	nevermind, its on 52 now..i guess the server load is tremendous, ill come back in a bit
2007-04-20T11:56:00.000Z	billy	deCon	yeah man.  they're bogged totally.  just relax.
2007-04-20T11:57:00.000Z	deCon	billy	i can understand, this is one hot pancake lol. i'm hoping to revamp an old p2 with this tonight
