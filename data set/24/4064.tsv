2007-10-26T22:00:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	i find XDMCP to be the best in simple thin client tech
2007-10-26T22:01:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	sun ray love? Im sitting outside drinking pineapple smoothies :)
2007-10-26T22:01:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	whether it can do what you want or not is another questions
2007-10-26T22:01:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	lol, as in SUN lol. you know SUN
2007-10-26T22:01:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	if your in the UK not he paper ok :P
2007-10-26T22:02:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	it does the job but I want to be able to have the session keep going even after the user logs off. I want this so my parents can for example do something on the kitched thin client, then head outside and use that one and just resume where they left off.
2007-10-26T22:02:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	lol
2007-10-26T22:02:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	yes, have you ever had the opertunuty to see SUN thin clients in action? with their little secure cards?
2007-10-26T22:03:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	again, XDMCP is probably what you want to look at, i tell you what, since i want the functionality you describe as well, i'll check out whether it hands session saving :d
2007-10-26T22:03:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	I use homemade thin clients :)
2007-10-26T22:04:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	keeping the session open is what I want, so if someone starts listening to music (its tied with a house-wise audio system) and shuts down the thin client, the music continues to play.
2007-10-26T22:04:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	woohah, i don't even think SUn can do that.
2007-10-26T22:05:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	lol
2007-10-26T22:05:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	in that case, you would have WINAMP for say, running on the server, and use the thin client, to Remote Control it. not winamp rather XMMS or somethign that has remote control features. i don't know which linux music app can handle this
2007-10-26T22:05:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	it works great if I log in locally to the server and the thin clients connect to the already existant session, but I want to be able to login...wait, how can I make it so a user gets logged on automatically (I dont mind security issues)?
2007-10-26T22:06:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	there is an automatic login option in the login options :)
2007-10-26T22:06:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	I only see a username field, no password? Does it fill that it itself?
2007-10-26T22:07:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	i don' think it cares about the password
2007-10-26T22:07:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	alright, let me try rebooting and see if it works.
2007-10-26T22:07:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	try it, other wise you might find you can set the password to nothing with the cmd line :)
2007-10-26T22:07:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	i believe you will need to do a full restart as restarting X will not cause the auto login i do not beleive
2007-10-26T22:07:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	i use that feature in work :S
2007-10-26T22:08:00.000Z	Creed	bofh80	yeah, full restart :( That means Ill get booted off IRC...stupid proxy.
2007-10-26T22:08:00.000Z	bofh80	Creed	aww ;p
