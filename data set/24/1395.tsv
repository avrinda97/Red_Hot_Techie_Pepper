2010-04-13T23:57:00.000Z	Pici	sweb	This isn't the place to file bug reports. use http://bugs.ubuntu.com, and thats not really a bug anyway, you shouldn't be replacing key system components like that and expect everything to Just Workâ„¢
2010-04-23T18:55:00.000Z	Pici	sweb	That is more appropriate for #vbox
2010-04-23T18:58:00.000Z	sweb	Pici	vbox need BIOS configure for using hardware simulation
2010-04-23T18:58:00.000Z	Pici	sweb	You're asking about configuring vbox.  Surely vbox's support channel would know more about that than we would.

2011-12-24T01:39:00.000Z	Pici	sweb	Is there a reason that 5.3.2 is not good enough for you?
