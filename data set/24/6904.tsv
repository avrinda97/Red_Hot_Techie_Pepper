2005-07-16T10:59:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	oh my god.
2005-07-16T10:59:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	never heard something as crazy as this
2005-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	so that guy is probably a master in linux without even knowing it
2005-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	great story
2005-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	try to install the parser package manually, download here: http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MS/MSERGEANT/XML-Parser-2.34.tar.gz
2005-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	maybe that works
2005-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	I suggest to try the apt-get first
2005-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl package (I guess)
2005-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	no problem, but not totally sure of the command
2005-07-16T11:13:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	yeehaa
2005-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	what errors?
2005-07-16T11:17:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	think you need to install the latest versions of gtk + , gconf, libgnomeui ...
2005-07-16T11:17:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	use synaptic
2005-07-16T11:17:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	and don't forget the dev packages (helps for me)
2005-07-16T11:23:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	not working?
2005-07-16T11:23:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	your choice, too bad
2005-07-16T11:24:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	I just mean it's a pity the errors didn't worked out
2005-07-16T11:24:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	what package exactly is it you want to install?
2005-07-16T11:26:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	can't find anything of it on google. I guess it's not well maintained
2005-07-16T11:26:00.000Z	trauma	ChurcH_of_FoamY	small chance that a 0.01 would work out well
