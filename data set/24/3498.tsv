2009-11-29T05:40:00.000Z	odie5533		How do I set WPA encryption from the terminal?
2009-11-29T05:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	check the wpasupplicant docs
2009-11-29T05:41:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	where is the conf file located?
2009-11-29T05:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
2010-03-10T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	it should mount as /media/cdrom0 due to /etc/fstab defining it
2010-03-10T05:57:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	it's not listed in fstab
2010-03-10T05:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	you should have a line like: /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
2010-03-10T05:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	if not, add it
2010-03-10T06:04:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	adding the line to fstab fixed it. Thanks!
2010-03-10T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	suprised you not got it man, glad you got the gold
2011-06-30T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	by default compiz, if no 3D accelleration is available then metacity
2011-08-01T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	the link will have the same access rights as the file you link to
2011-08-01T01:40:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	o
2011-08-01T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	the comamnd I made ubootu give will fix it
2011-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	kill -9 is the biggest hammer
2011-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	do you have software centre open etc?
2011-08-01T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	its the pretty interface folks use to install software
2011-08-01T05:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	another app which should be closed is synaptic
2011-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	me too, new users will use the gui though
2011-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	does ubottu's command not work?
2011-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	It responded, "dpkg: error: dpkg status database is locked by another process"
2011-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	odie5533	ActionParsnip	so nope, didn't work.
2011-08-01T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	strange, that should clear that off. What is the output of:  ps -ef | grep dpkg
2011-08-01T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	odie5533	probably easier ;)
