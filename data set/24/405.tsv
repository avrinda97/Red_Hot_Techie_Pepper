2011-10-02T10:36:00.000Z	tatego		Hello! I formatted 8GB usb flash drive to ext2 to transfer files over 6GB from laptop to desktop. I got a new laptop in which I want to install ubuntu. But while installing it via liveUSB the installer detected the 8GB usb and I by mistake selected it for installation. Now my usb drive contains Ubuntu in 8GB and the laptop HDD OS Windows remains the same. How can I revert it? Everytime I try to boot without usb it gives grub error but
2011-10-02T10:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	do you have a windows install or recovery disc?
2011-10-02T10:38:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	Umm... no. How it would have helped?
2011-10-02T10:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	you could get windows back for the moment, you asked how you could revert it I assume the windows n= boot all by utself
2011-10-02T10:40:00.000Z	urlin2u		itself*
2011-10-02T10:40:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	I can boot to Windows as well as Ubuntu with usb drive but without usb it gives grub error.
2011-10-02T10:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	what us it you want then I'm confused, you can just do a ubuntu install and make sure grub goes to the HD's mbr, and you will be set. But you I assume know the partiton amounts and limitations, and whether you have a sstandard mbr set up not a gpt.
2011-10-02T10:44:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	It used to boot directly to Windows before installation. But during installtion, it detecgted Windows HDD and USB drive that it installed bootloader in HDD and Ubuntu in USB keeping Windows same. What I want is that to do is to have Windows boot directly without grub menu or anything. I did this by mistake so want to revert back to what it was then install Ubuntu properly. I see grub error without usb drive ...
2011-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	I thought so that is why I asked if you nhad ethier windows disc that is how you fix that, although we can use another bootloader called lilo from a ubuntu disc.
2011-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	How to do it with Ubuntu disc?
2011-10-02T10:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	first lets get some info, can you confirm that the windows internal drive is not a gpt, or other than a standard set up using the mbr to boot from.
2011-10-02T10:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	really if you can boot to windows now you should burn a recovery disc, and are you backed up?
2011-10-02T10:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	with a recovery disc you can fix this using MS tools.
2011-10-02T10:54:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	I can boot to Windows with usb, yes. While installation it considered usb as hard disk drive something. I'll try to get receovery disk. What will I have to do with the recovery cd?
2011-10-02T10:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	the recovery disc boots so choose the repair go to the terminal offered and run bootrec.exe /fixmbr  if that doesn't work it is just a matter of figuring out the partitions, where the boot flag is and the boot files we have a script for that no big deal.
2011-10-02T10:56:00.000Z	urlin2u		bootrec.exe /fixmb  in one line easier to read tatego
2011-10-02T10:57:00.000Z	tatego	urlin2u	From what I understand, it has instaleld bootloader in Windows HDD, is there any way to delete that loader and let it boot directly to Windows?
2011-10-02T10:57:00.000Z	tatego		I see
2011-10-02T10:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	sorry bootrec.exe /fixmbr
2011-10-02T10:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	you need to run this script then from ubuntu and pastebin it. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/  I will also say that I'm getting ready to crash so the faster yo9u can get stuff posted I can help you.
2011-10-02T11:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	the bootscript will tell if you actual put grub in windows, I doubt it unless you have been trying to fix it if the thumb is booting windows.
2011-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	urlin2u		and if the thumb is booting windows*
2011-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	did you get this, you need to run this script then from ubuntu and pastebin it. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/  I will also say that I'm getting ready to crash so the faster you can get stuff posted I can help you
2011-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	tatego	and this the bootscript will tell if you actual put grub in windows, I doubt it unless you have been trying to fix it if, and the thumb is booting windows.
