2011-03-11T03:16:00.000Z	teropafu		help i installed testdisk but i dont know how to access it. it doesnt appear in System
2011-03-11T03:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	its a cli command
2011-03-11T03:17:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 how do i add it to System?
2011-03-11T03:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	you won't really,it runs in terminal.You can add it then tell it to run in terminal but you may as welljust run: sudo testdisk
2011-03-11T03:20:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 i saw a video where the user goes to system > administration > partition editor but i don't have 'partition editor' in administration
2011-03-11T03:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	thats gparted
2011-03-11T03:24:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 ok now i see gparted partition editor, thanks
2011-03-11T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	np :)
2011-03-11T03:28:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 oh gparted partitions editor isnt associated with testdisk?
2011-03-11T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	no, its different
2011-03-11T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	if you only have 30Gb partitioned and 270Gb unpartitioned
2011-03-11T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	but you get the idea
2011-03-11T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	wrong target, sorry
2011-03-11T03:37:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	i'm not sure if i have 270 gb unpartitioned or not.  i want to recover data from the '30 GB Filesystem'.  can i just go ahead or is the disk being detected as 30 gb going to pose a problem?
2011-03-11T03:43:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 so if the 270 gb turns out to be unpartitioned, then i need to fix it so that it shows up as 300 gb filesystem?
2011-03-11T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	you can partition with parted. sudo fdisk -l   will show what's going on
2011-03-11T03:44:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 i'm not sure but i might have partitioned the 30 gb when i accidentally installed ubuntu on it
2011-03-11T03:48:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 will this partition be a problem for testdisk
2011-03-11T03:48:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 this partition issue, i meant
2011-03-11T03:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	you only need testdisk if your FAT gets corrupted
2011-03-11T03:51:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 as far as i know the FAT isnt corrupted. i just want to recover the files that were lost from the formatting and i thought testdisk might do it
2011-03-11T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	sure, you can also use it with foremost :)
2011-03-11T03:52:00.000Z	teropafu	ActionParsnip	 so can i just disregard the fact that it shows up as '30 gb filesystem' and proceed with testdisk?
2011-03-11T03:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	teropafu	you can use testdisk to make a 300Gb partition the fsck it
