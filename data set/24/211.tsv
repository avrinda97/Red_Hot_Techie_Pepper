2012-11-10T03:26:00.000Z	PoolShark_		I believe the acceptable term is developmentally delayed
2012-11-10T03:26:00.000Z	PoolShark_		"retarded" is not the preferred nomenclature
2012-11-10T03:27:00.000Z	PoolShark_		anywya, anyone know if the SSD caching in H77 works in Linux, or more specifically, is the caching handled natively by the motherboard, completely transparently to the O/S, without the use of a driver - or is a driver required?
2012-11-10T03:28:00.000Z	PoolShark_		that generally means X isn't running
2012-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	PoolShark_		if X was active, vidalia would not give you that error message
2012-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	So how am I using xchat ?
2012-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	the evidence says you aren't
2012-11-10T03:30:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	and you're trying to start vidalia from a shell? or from an icon?:
2012-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	I've tried both, Icon gives me permission errors
2012-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	then there's probably something wrong with permissions
2012-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	I'm aware of that
2012-11-10T03:31:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	so why not fix them and see if the error goes away?
2012-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	 Well this was my original question, But apparently I don't have X running
2012-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	do you want my help?
2012-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	Well IF you can help. And not telling me X isnt running.
2012-11-10T03:33:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	are you sure your X server is running on 0.0?
2012-11-10T03:33:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	and not 1.0 or 0.1 or sometihng?
2012-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	I'm sat at my machine now, it's a fresh install
2012-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	Do you know anything about the error i'm interested in ?
2012-11-10T03:38:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	no, I guess I don't. I'll leave you alone now
2012-11-10T03:42:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	are you going to answer my question about how you installed vidalia?
2012-11-10T03:42:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	I asked you quite a while ago
2012-11-10T03:42:00.000Z	Emery	PoolShark_	The only way you can install vidalia.
2012-11-10T03:43:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Emery	just answer my question. What method did you use to install vidalia?
