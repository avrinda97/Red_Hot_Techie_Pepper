2012-10-22T16:27:00.000Z	michealPW		When I try to checkout the latest supertux source from SVN I get the following error ("Password for '(null)' GNOME keyring:") anyone know what it is? It says in the manual that "everybody is granted anonymous read-only access" :\
2012-10-22T16:27:00.000Z	michealPW		It seems to want me to enter a password, which I don't have hehe
2012-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	michealPW		Oh
2012-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	michealPW		hehe thx Patrick :)
2012-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	michealPW		Hrmm, it kind of worked. I got passed that authentication but then I get a 500 internal server error, something about the "OPTIONS" :\
2012-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	michealPW		"svn: Server sent unexpected return value (500 Internal Server Error) in response to OPTIONS request for 'http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux'"
2012-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	do they have instructions on their site for how to checkout the files (and use SVN)?
2012-10-22T16:34:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	you could check the debian repositories for the latest version then.
2012-10-22T18:41:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping
2012-10-23T17:48:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	it should be in /home/username/.face
2012-10-23T17:48:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	That's what everybody tells me and it's the only thing I can find on Google... But ~/.face does not exist :(
2012-10-23T17:49:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	did you try ls -l in your home directory?
2012-10-23T17:49:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	sorry ls -la
2012-10-23T17:50:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	I think that's the old GNOME v2 location, mate. That location does not exist on these newer GNOME 3 systems, it seems.
2012-10-23T17:50:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	They use something called "AccountServices", whatever that is :p
2012-10-23T17:51:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	I have it in my home directory.
2012-10-23T17:52:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	Hrmm, that's interesting. Maybe I don't understand ~/.face... Maybe that's for what's currently selected as your default? Like.. When you select an avatar, maybe it copies it var /var/wherever into ~/.face
2012-10-23T17:53:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	My problem is I swapped out LightDM for KDM.. When I open the "About Me" in KDE, I have no icon selected. When I try to choose one, I only have very limited options, none of the options available in LightDM/GDM.. So what I want to do is symlink all those nice avatars that LightDM/GDM have so they're available in KDM/KDE
2012-10-23T18:01:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	Ah, so that's why.. GDM is what looks in ~/ for a .face and if not found it looks for a ~/.face.icon. If still not found it'll read your gnome config for the location.. So really my question should not be where GDM is storing it, but where Ubuntu's LightDM stores it? :P
2012-10-23T18:02:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	why were you looking for it anyhow?
2012-10-23T18:02:00.000Z	michealPW	PatrickDickey	I want to make symbolic links to all these avatars and put the links in the directory KDM looks for avatars. I stopped using LightDM and I use KDM instead (But KDM by default has really ugly icons and there's not many to choose from.)
2012-10-23T18:02:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	it probably still uses the Gnome config to find the location, so I'd check that first.
2012-10-29T04:27:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	which cards does that work with? Is that the one that won't work with anything older than a HD 5000 series?
2012-10-29T04:49:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	michealPW	It sounds like the janitor removed a compiled file that's required.  Probably needs to reinstall the graphics driver.
