2007-04-23T10:19:00.000Z	oopsien00b		i desesperately need help
2007-04-23T10:20:00.000Z	oopsien00b		erUSL: the only way i can disable it that I know is by launching beryl
2007-04-23T10:20:00.000Z	oopsien00b		but launching beryl freeses my pc
2007-04-23T10:20:00.000Z	oopsien00b		there must be another way
2007-04-23T10:21:00.000Z	oopsien00b		how can i disable XGL rendering or make it NOT freeze in beryl??
2007-04-23T10:22:00.000Z	oopsien00b		without launching beryl? Because Beryl loads it and that's why freezes my pc
2007-04-23T10:22:00.000Z	oopsien00b		can anyone please help me my problem sounds simple
2007-04-23T10:23:00.000Z	oopsien00b		im sure i could fix it by correcting 1 line in beryl
2007-04-23T10:23:00.000Z	oopsien00b		but i tried reinstalling it and it doesnt fix it
2007-04-23T10:23:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	whats the problem ?
2007-04-23T10:23:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	beryl is set to force use XGL rendering, but XGL rendering freeses my PC
2007-04-23T10:25:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	i want to reset rendering to "automatic" but i can't find out how without launching beryl, which freezes my PC
2007-04-23T10:25:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	launch berly-manager, right click it on your task bar, select Advanced Beryl Options -> Direct Rendering Platform   and select something other than XGL
2007-04-23T10:25:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	but it starts by loading XGL which freeses the PC before I have time to do that
2007-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	uhm..holdon then..let me see if i can find a config file for it somewhere...
2007-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	still here?
2007-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	yes i am here
2007-04-23T10:31:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	in your home directory there should be a file called .beryl-managerrc
2007-04-23T10:31:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	edit the line in it that says "platform=" make sure it says "platform=0"
2007-04-23T10:32:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	there's only a .beryl folder, not a .beryl-manager folder
2007-04-23T10:32:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	it's not a folder, it's a file
2007-04-23T10:35:00.000Z	oopsien00b	bluefox83	using the terminal gedit .beryl-manager in my home directory gives me an empty file
2007-04-23T10:35:00.000Z	bluefox83	oopsien00b	just run "beryl-manager" from terminal, it will open the manager without launching beryl
