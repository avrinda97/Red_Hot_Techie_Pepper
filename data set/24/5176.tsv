2006-12-27T13:18:00.000Z	violot		Open SuSE 64 bit was slower than Ubuntu 64 bit, so that's why I switched to Ubuntu after SuSE 10.1 came out after being with SuSE since 9.1
2006-12-27T13:20:00.000Z	violot		(on SuSE)
2006-12-27T13:20:00.000Z	violot		My 64 bit Ubuntu is the most stable machine I've used believe it or not.
2006-12-27T13:20:00.000Z	violot		64 bit Edgy.
2006-12-27T13:21:00.000Z	violot		Yeah, if you don't want WINE, 64 bit is great actually for me.
2006-12-27T13:21:00.000Z	violot		Flash works though.
2006-12-27T13:21:00.000Z	violot		I had my video drivers installed though.
2006-12-27T13:21:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	yeah i agree, even if you want wine it can be done - i did it
2006-12-27T13:22:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	yeah i had twinview working for me too it rocks :D
2006-12-27T13:23:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- what version of nvidia-glx are using?
2006-12-27T13:23:00.000Z	violot	petriborg	ummm
2006-12-27T13:24:00.000Z	violot	petriborg	1.0-9629
2006-12-27T13:24:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- did you have to install other repositories to make that work or ?
2006-12-27T13:25:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- so you did them manually?
2006-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- ok how does that work though when you have an update to the kernel?
2006-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	violot	petriborg	I don't remember XD
2006-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- no it has 32bit too
2006-12-27T13:26:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- :(
2006-12-27T13:28:00.000Z	violot	petriborg	try going to #ubuntu-xgl and asking who owns http://nvidia.limitless.lupine.me.uk/
2006-12-27T13:30:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- yeah i'm just reluctant to jump to edgy without knowing how that will turn out - i have a very nice stable dapper but has old 8776 drivers on it
2006-12-27T13:36:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- one last question, you ever update you're kernel yet since installing this beryl guys nvidia stuff?
2006-12-27T13:39:00.000Z	violot	petriborg	I run 2.6.17-10-generic
2006-12-27T13:39:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	- ok thanks
2006-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	petriborg	violot	did you're old dapper x config work in edgy too?
