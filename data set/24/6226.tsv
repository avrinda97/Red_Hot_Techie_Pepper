2005-12-06T15:04:00.000Z	Going		Greets, is this the proper channel to find help using Ubuntu?
2005-12-06T15:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Thats why its called #ubuntu
2005-12-06T15:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Recognised or mounted?
2005-12-06T15:07:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Do you know what device the fat32 partition is?
2005-12-06T15:08:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	What do you mean by 'what device'?
2005-12-06T15:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	like /dev/sba1 or whatecer
2005-12-06T15:09:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	I mean, it is basically an external hard drive that I've divided into two partitions.
2005-12-06T15:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Yep, but the partitions are recognised differently
2005-12-06T15:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Can you easily plug in / unplug the drive? i've never used a external hdd before.
2005-12-06T15:11:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	I partitioned it using Partition Magic 8, and this is the first time I've plugged it into a Linux box, so I don't think it has a Linux file structure built in yet.
2005-12-06T15:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	It won't have.
2005-12-06T15:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	And it doesn't need it ;-)
2005-12-06T15:12:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	I can easily unplug it if I go to the desktop, click on the icon for the partition it does recoginize, and select "Unmount Volume"
2005-12-06T15:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	I meant physically unplug it.
2005-12-06T15:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Mounting / Unmounting is something different
2005-12-06T15:13:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	Just noticed the private chat room...  will jump onto that.
2005-12-06T15:16:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	Are you receiving my messages in the private room?
2005-12-06T15:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	No
2005-12-06T15:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Are you using XChat?
2005-12-06T15:16:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	Eh, I'll stick to this then.
2005-12-06T15:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Ubotu is a bot ;D
2005-12-06T15:18:00.000Z	Going	Stormx2	Eh, one sec, ompaul just messaged me about obotu or something...  I may have to quickly register.
2005-12-06T15:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Yeah, @ is used on some IRC clients to signify "operator" status, but that doesn't apply here really.
2005-12-06T15:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	Going	Try /msg nickserv register PASSWORD
