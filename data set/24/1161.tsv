2010-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	chalk		hi, i want to download ubuntu 9, is there a download link for that?
2010-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	ubuntu.com
2010-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i'm only to able to find ubuntu 10, not 9
2010-06-04T05:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	ah.. why 9? 9.10 is end of life 18 months from Oct 2009
2010-06-04T05:06:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i cannot connect to the internet, listen to music, or even shut down the computer when using ubuntu 10
2010-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	end of life?
2010-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	better to find out why.. perhaps is an ACPI issue.. music? mp3's?  you have to install the codec for that.. end of life means the version will no longer be supported
2010-06-04T05:08:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i'm thinking it's the kernel, it happened with all distros that used that kernel
2010-06-04T05:08:00.000Z	chalk		i'm not good with linux
2010-06-04T05:08:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i can't even install anything without the internet connection
2010-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	It really sounds like you have several issues going on.. internet is one.. with that you can do a full upgrade.  I believe there is a new kernel or updates to the existing one.. are you wireless?
2010-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	yes
2010-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i'm using a different distribution... i have 10.04 on another cd but i'm planning on erasing it and put 9 inside
2010-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	wireless can be an issue.. if you want to attempt to connect with it again.. make sure your router is broadcasting the ssid and has all encryption (wep, wpa, etc) turned off.. once it's connected then tweek
2010-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	Scunizi		!unrar > Fudge
2010-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	i've done that before, able to connect for a few seconds with 4220b/s download
2010-06-04T05:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	do you have the ability to plug the computer directly into the internet via a wire?  you can do that and do the updates.. then try again.. sometimes network-manager is just interfearing and might work with wicd instead.
2010-06-04T05:12:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	no, not really
2010-06-04T05:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	you didn't install the server version did you?
2010-06-04T05:13:00.000Z	chalk	Scunizi	no, i know what i downloaded
2010-06-04T05:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	just asking.. you might be able to get the 9.10 version by using torrents..
2010-06-04T05:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	http://ubuntu.media.mit.edu/ubuntu-releases/9.10/
2010-06-04T05:15:00.000Z	chalk		thanks scunizi
2010-06-04T05:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	chalk	good luck
