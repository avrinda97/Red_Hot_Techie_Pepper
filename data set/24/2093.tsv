2009-08-22T01:53:00.000Z	nmvictor		I wanted to upgrade my kernel to the one in jaunty,should be 2.6.28.(14/15)-generic, i know it comes with ext4.filesystem and thats which is one of the reasons i need the kernel-update.Im in intrepid and i dont intend to move to jaunty anytime soon, will upgrading to the jaunty-shipped kernel pose a threat to my data due to the ext3  to ext4 filesystem?
2009-08-22T01:53:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Jaunty defaults to ext3 itself, ext4 is an option you can choose
2009-08-22T01:54:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	so,the option is during installation or the download?
2009-08-22T01:55:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	During installation, I can't remember exactly when but you're explicitly given the choice of filesystems at some point in the install process
2009-08-22T01:55:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	In either case if you upgrade to Jaunty it's not going to automatically "upgrade" your partitions to ext4 anyway, so you shouldn't need to worry unless you choose it yourself
2009-08-22T01:57:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	im still on intrepid, with the third extended filesystem will opting for ext4 pose a threat to my data?
2009-08-22T01:57:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Well, I haven't experienced any data loss with it myself, but ext4 is not considered a "production" filesystem yet, it's just too new...and in the case of some earlier versions of KDE 4 and ext4 combinations there were actual data loss issues
2009-08-22T01:58:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	I would say go with ext4 if you specifically need a feature in ext4
2009-08-22T01:59:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	i need the efficiency it comes with,its definitely better than ext3.isnt it?
2009-08-22T02:00:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Not particularly, it does offer the capability of handling larger filesystems on 64 bit machines
2009-08-22T02:01:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	There are some features to reduce fragmentation of large files as well, but I don't know if it's worth risking _losing_ your files just to get those features
2009-08-22T02:02:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	do you mind giving me a oneline command(tasksel/aptitude) that will help me update to the kernel in jaunty(im not even sure about its version digits).im completely put off with the word compile whenever it is placed next to the word kernel
2009-08-22T02:02:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	I'd recommend you look at the "disadvantages" section here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4
2009-08-22T02:03:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	thanks
2009-08-22T02:03:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Are you running Intrepid? I don't think that it's possible to run a kernel from a later distribution on an earlier one unless you do compile it
2009-08-22T02:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	i guess that leaves me no choice than an upgrade, im prepared to stick to intrepid for any other reasons except the kernel.
2009-08-22T02:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	just a query,do you know how to compile?
2009-08-22T02:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	the kernel?
2009-08-22T02:06:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Well, how you compile something depends on what you're compiling :> There are instructions on the Ubuntu wiki that will tell you how to compile your own kernels and install them as proper Ubuntu packages, however
2009-08-22T02:10:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	ok,the only bad thing is the integrity of the archive that the kernel comes with, i downloaded 2.6.30.* version for some 'edu_purposes' and couldnt extract using nautilus, so i had to use the tar at the terminal which also echoed an error message after the extraction.How does one gamble a whole system with such minor integrity errors?
2009-08-22T02:18:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	Well a corrupt download could happen for any number of reasons, which sounds like what happened...you might want to download it again and then check the md5sum against the one posted on the download page to make sure it matches
2009-08-22T02:18:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	As an aside, though, if you're thinking of upgrading to Jaunty just to get ext4, then stick with Intrepid, unless there's a feature in ext4 that you absolutely must have
2009-08-22T02:21:00.000Z	nmvictor	orochi	thanks, thats important.hadnt thougt of md5sum
2009-08-22T02:21:00.000Z	orochi	nmvictor	np
