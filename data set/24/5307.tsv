2006-08-20T14:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	you will find a useful url from the bot "ubotu"
2006-08-20T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	what are the specs for the machine? (you can do a server isntall)
2006-08-20T15:13:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	It's a celeron 466mhz, 128MB's ram - 40gb drive
2006-08-20T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	so you really could try xubuntu with that much ram
2006-08-20T15:16:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	KDE and Gnome should be able to run in a 128mb environment - What about said alternate-install cd - I assume it's available for download on the ubuntu servers... does it have the old text based install?
2006-08-20T15:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	afik it does
2006-08-20T15:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	the ultimate is to install the "server" version and add >> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop << after that
2006-08-20T15:18:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	ok - I was attempting that but could not seem to get the install cd to like the command - documentation just says type server and go - which would work on the breezy cd - but on the dapper cd it gives me an error
2006-08-20T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	I would not run ubuntu (GNOME) without 256megs and I note the install cd suggest 192megs
2006-08-20T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	the server cd is all command line
2006-08-20T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	or ncurses to be more accurate
2006-08-20T15:19:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	alright so either way I need a different cd
2006-08-20T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	I think so
2006-08-20T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	and for speed do it this way
2006-08-20T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	server then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-20T15:21:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	does that box have a seperate video card?
2006-08-20T15:21:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	yes
2006-08-20T15:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	that is good so you will not be sharing your ram with the video card
2006-08-20T15:22:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	No I thought of that - the pain is I just want to get the system running - the ram will be upgraded in a couple weeks - till then I just want to get it going for coding...
2006-08-20T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	so get the server cd already :)
2006-08-20T15:27:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	I'm curious - will the alternate install cd work the same as installing the server cd and then installing desktop? or what is the alternate install cd?
2006-08-20T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	it will have you not downloaded it already?
2006-08-20T15:29:00.000Z	Routh	ompaul	nope - just have the desktop cd - I'm going to try the alternate install
2006-08-20T15:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Routh	I am trying to find you a doc that will tell you the differences
