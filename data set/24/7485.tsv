2005-01-28T13:59:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	does sysresccd have ntfsresize?
2005-01-28T13:59:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	 I think
2005-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	thanks.
2005-01-28T14:03:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	ntfsresize - Resize an NTFS partition without losing data -- is in ntfsprogs, going to try it out, thanks, found out at http://packages.debian.org/unstable/otherosfs/ntfsprogs
2005-02-19T11:52:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	fix what? looks ok to me
2005-02-19T12:21:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	lol
2005-02-19T12:23:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	 I have to rebuild the kernel with PaX and netdev-random
2005-02-19T12:25:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	ubuntu kernel on the desktop with PaX? and what is netdev-random?
2005-02-19T12:25:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	 netdev-random gathers random data based on the timing f network card interrupts
2005-02-19T12:25:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	and yeah I use grsecurity on the desktop
2005-02-19T12:26:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	 it only breaks a handfull of things, which are easily worked around with chpax/paxctl (I wish paxctl could nuke PT_GNU_STACK)
2005-02-19T12:29:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	i don't run that stuff on the desktop at least now, think ubuntu is working on some measures for that, thanks to the link you provided at ubuntu's site i saw
2005-02-19T12:29:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	stuNNed	 yeah, the hardened debian project and some of the ubuntu devs like pitti are going at it :)
2005-03-10T09:12:00.000Z	stuNNed	bluefoxicy	:P
