2008-04-23T19:52:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	Sorry it was on. I turned it off from the router. And am now restarting it. Ok finally it stops working!
2008-04-23T19:52:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	struggling with semantics :)
2008-04-23T19:54:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	You know/
2008-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	What is the place where network-admin stores all my 'locations' data?
2008-04-23T19:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	I don't know that, sorry
2008-04-23T19:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	the main config file is /etc/network/interfaces - possibly the other info is stored in a dot file (in  .gnome2/ or something - but as I said, I don't actually know that
2008-04-23T20:05:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	OK i keyed in my network info in the network-admin. Now when i ping my router it says Network is unreachable.
2008-04-23T20:28:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	there?
2008-04-23T20:30:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	I have to turn off firestarter now to browse.
2008-04-23T20:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	well, that's a firewall config issue,. right ?
2008-04-23T20:31:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	It has_now_become a firewall config issue
2008-04-23T20:31:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	Before the whole network-manager uninstall thing it didn't happen. What should I do?
2008-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	think?  You probably need to look at your firestarter settings, yes ?
2008-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	Yes.
2008-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	can you help?
2008-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	...
2008-04-23T20:33:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	Thought you do understand that re-configuring the network has made it a firewall config issue don't you?
2008-04-23T20:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	just ask the channel - there are currently 1370 othher people here you know
2008-04-23T20:33:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	sorry.
2008-04-23T20:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	I can't solve all your problems :)
2008-04-23T20:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	hint: check outgoing permissions on port 80 in firestarter
2008-04-23T20:35:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	If only I knew how.
2008-04-23T20:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sdakak	open firestarter, click the help button. Alternatively, visit the firestarter home page
2008-04-23T20:36:00.000Z	sdakak	thoreauputic	I would better feed myself first. Thank you :)
