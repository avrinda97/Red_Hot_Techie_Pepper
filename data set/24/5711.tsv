2006-09-07T09:39:00.000Z	Tonren		Gah... maybe I SHOULD move to a different distro.
2006-09-07T09:40:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 why ubuntu rocks
2006-09-07T09:40:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	There are just all of these freaking GUI applications and NONE of them work, and everything is just a How-To as opposed to a... a WHY-to.
2006-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 that is a KDE/Gnome complaint, not an Ubuntu complait :)
2006-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	Well, I can't figure out how to get rid of them, and no one else seems to know either.  :\  Maybe I should just reinstall again...
2006-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 what are you trying to get rid of?
2006-09-07T09:42:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 services that start on boot?
2006-09-07T09:42:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	I'm trying to stop postfix from booting because it's not configured properly and gives errors every time I dhclient, and I don't need it.  I'm trying to get rid of networkmanager applet, but no matter how many times I disable it in session manager, it keeps coming back.
2006-09-07T09:43:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 np, update-rc.d -f postfix remove
2006-09-07T09:44:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 you can use that same syntax to remove anything in /etc/init.d/ or add like update-rc.d -f fooapp defaults
2006-09-07T09:44:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	So, /etc/init.d just contains a bunch of symlinks..?
2006-09-07T09:45:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 no, that is where the real files are, they are symlinke to /etc/rcX.d/ where x = runlevel
2006-09-07T09:46:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 take a look at /etc/inittab
2006-09-07T09:56:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 holy cow that is a beefy question. Gnome/KDE = windowing environments  KDM/GDM/XDM are display mangers (the control the X session start and stop and login) Metacity/Enlightenment/FVWM/Fluxbox are all window managers (the control the look and feel of the windows,task bars, background, etc) GTK is a toolkit to develope Gnome apps as Qt is a toolkit to develope KDE apps and so on
2006-09-07T09:56:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	So *DM are all pretty basic, huh?
2006-09-07T09:57:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	Dr_Willis: So, Fluxbox actually runs on top of... what?  GNOME?
2006-09-07T09:57:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 basicall, in a nut shell, GDM is written with GTK, KDM is writting with Qt, XDM is written with TCL (I think)
2006-09-07T09:58:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 so Kaps are Qt Gapps are GTK, just different developing toolkits/libraries
2006-09-07T09:59:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 no, fluxbox is a window manager only
2006-09-07T09:59:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 you are smart, and quick
2006-09-07T10:01:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 just read. man foo, info foo, less /usr/share/doc/foo/foo.txt google foo, read
2006-09-07T10:01:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	Trust me, man, you just recited my own mantra to me
2006-09-07T10:02:00.000Z	AAA	Tonren	 and ask questions, and break your box, then fix it :: lather,rinse,repeat
2006-09-07T10:02:00.000Z	Tonren	AAA	Dr_Willis: It's just that I'm a college student, and while I don't LIKE having information spoon-fed to me, it's just SO time consuming to find exactly the piece of information I'm looking for...
