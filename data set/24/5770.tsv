2006-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	iNiku		how would you guys install dapper on an existing system that has /home (which needs to be preserved) on LVM?
2006-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	you need alternative cd to do lvm
2006-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	okay, can that install on pre-existing logical volumes, preserving /home?
2006-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	Yep
2006-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	Go on expert mode (to make sure)
2006-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	does it also handle /root on lvm?
2006-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	lvm on top of md, even
2006-06-01T08:43:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	erm, / on lvm+md, obviously, not /root
2006-06-01T08:43:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	I have never tried it but i think it does (tried lvm of /home though)
2006-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	I would guess ath_hal should do it
2006-06-17T10:15:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	the interface doesn't show up at all
2006-06-17T10:15:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	hmm, just tried blacklisting the madwifi stuff and loading the -ng modules manually but it's not working
2006-06-17T10:16:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	have you been able to use the -ng modules that come with ubuntu?
2006-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	No I am trying to setup my ubuntu server with madwifi-ng (its running the standard kernel at the moment) (because hostapd in ubuntu is compiled against madwifi-ng)
2006-06-17T10:18:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	looks like the ubuntu -ng modules are not working at all for some reason
2006-06-17T14:56:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	I try to avoid that
2006-06-17T14:57:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	me too, used to have to do it in the old days, though
2006-06-17T15:02:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	yes, if they have the permissions. more useful is to just connect to your screen session from several terminals, either windows side by side or, say, from your home and work machines
2006-06-17T15:03:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	like, I always have irssi running under screen and I connect to the same screen from the laptop and desktop at home and from my work machine
2006-06-17T15:04:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	I have used it before but I don't need it most of the time
2006-06-17T15:05:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	I use it all the time. also, for work stuff, I may have all my connections to the servers under screen, then have a bunch of terminals open side by side connected to the same screen but showing different "windows"
2006-06-17T15:06:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	that way the connections will stay there even if I lose network or put the laptop to sleep or whatever
2006-06-17T15:06:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	iNiku	I try not to have loads of connections to servers open (use ssh-agent) and can connect very quickly if I need to
2006-06-17T15:09:00.000Z	iNiku	h3sp4wn	I often need to be running stuff on several servers at the same time, or looking at logs, or whatever... using screen and multiple xterms is very handy for that
