2004-10-13T15:49:00.000Z	dies_irae		Ah, ok I didn't know the kernel command. I have no devices hooked up. I will try that, thanks.
2004-10-13T15:51:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	that doesn't look very good anyway, you might not be able to use USB. what kernel do you have?
2004-10-13T15:52:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	googling for the problem found number of reports, but no clear answer.. usually people have a specific problem with a flash disk or scanner, not hub itself
2004-10-13T15:52:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	apart from kernel, what motherboard do you have?
2004-10-13T15:55:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	you don't need to save it, just use it.
2004-10-14T16:03:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	i am not in ubuntu right now (plain debian), is there some "failsafe" recovery or whatever option in grub?
2004-10-14T16:07:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	nah, don't give up... it ought to be possible to disable it even in ubuntu kernel, otherwise you can compile your own (i do it for instance)
2004-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	thats the latest
2004-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	could you try knoppix again and somehow save output of "dmesg", "lspci -vvv" and "lsmod" ?
2004-10-14T16:25:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	if you do "nousb" you should definitely see no usb initialization
2004-10-14T16:25:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	unless it is userland which kernel doesn't manage to stop.. i am not sure about this... can you see some "kudzu" before that point?
2004-10-14T16:26:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	right
2004-10-14T16:28:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	what i meant is that despite the kernel setting a userspace configuration tool called kudzu could have tried to modprobe the USB module "behind your back".. which is a wild theory as USB is not supposed to work at that point anyway because kernel doesn't allow it at all... but if usbcore is a module as well, things can happen
2004-10-14T16:29:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	go on with getting that info... if I can't crack it you will still need to post that on mailing list and quite likely a bug report will deveop from that as I suspect something is rotten in the distro
2004-10-14T16:38:00.000Z	dies_irae	Qua	I uploaded the contents to http://www.ame-tsuchi.com/ubuntu/ in three files. I'll be right back, pasta on stove
2004-10-14T16:38:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	DCC SEND some this way ;)
2004-10-14T16:46:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	back yet?
2004-10-14T16:52:00.000Z	dies_irae	Qua	yes
2004-10-14T16:53:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	you have a HW problem with your particular model, see exactly the same problem report here: http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-July/msg01307.html
2004-10-14T16:53:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	what i recommend is to send it to mailing list *and* file it in bugzilla because it has not been reported for ubuntu yet
2004-10-14T16:54:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	it has nothing to do with ubuntu as it has nothing to do with fedora it has been reported for, but it will make people aware of the problem
2004-10-14T16:54:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	next step it to report it to people who actually can fix it and that is the kernel USB developers
2004-10-14T16:56:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	in the meantime, if you dare, you can compile your own kernel, fishing out the config from loopback-mounted iso image, so that ubuntu will be happy with it.. and disable all usb altogether
2004-10-14T16:57:00.000Z	Qua	dies_irae	actually you can ask the mailing list how comes "nousb" doesn't work ?!? this is the right thing to do... it must be possible to disable it. but USB kernel team could fix it for your model for good, so tell them please
