2007-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	mayorbuttes		directx for linux isn't known as wine =/
2007-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	mayorbuttes		you're thinking openGL which is what linux uses.
2007-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	mayorbuttes		dx is proprietary windows
2007-05-05T11:29:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	that depends on for what you're using it
2007-05-05T11:30:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	OpenGL is nice because it's crossplatform and usable even on fat mainframes.
2007-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	That does no good if you're a modern gamer ;)
2007-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	OpenGL isn't made for just games. It's used for all types of games.
2007-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	it's used for all types of applications I meant
2007-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	You're missing the point ;). DX out performs OpenGL in modern day videogames.
2007-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	So if you value performance, you go with DX. If you value morality and portability, you go with opengl.
2007-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	I wouldn't know. It's not really my issue.
2007-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	I'm not playing that many games and I'm not using Ubuntu for games.
2007-05-05T11:33:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	I'm not posing it as morality
2007-05-05T11:33:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	No one is, and that's understandable. However when you say it's "better", there really should be some type of explanation.
2007-05-05T11:34:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	It's better for some situations but not so nice for others. I'm not sure about DirectX so I can't comment on it.
2007-05-05T11:34:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	Now i'm really interested. In what areas would opengl come out on top of dx in your opinion?
2007-05-05T11:35:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	it's better for huge fat scientific graphical modeling under mainframes because it's the only option
2007-05-05T11:35:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	DirectX is tied to the win32 OS.
2007-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	ctrl+alt+F1->F6
2007-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	I mean permanently
2007-05-27T09:44:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	sudo apt-get remove xserver ubuntu-desktop
2007-05-27T09:44:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	Lilacor	hah, no no :p. I mean, I just don't want to login via a gui. I still like xserver
2007-05-27T09:46:00.000Z	Lilacor	mayorbuttes	then just remove ubuntu-desktop and take the xserver out of your rc files
