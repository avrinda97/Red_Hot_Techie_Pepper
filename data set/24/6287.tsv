2006-01-17T06:45:00.000Z	navarone		luisito..try mounting in in /media
2006-01-17T06:47:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	but it tells me hda doesn't exists
2006-01-17T06:47:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	try command "fdisk -l" in terminal and see what it says
2006-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	this is strange, only /hda/sda1 is shown
2006-01-17T06:53:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	it seems the MB doesn't detect the HD
2006-01-17T06:54:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	I'll shutdown and check connectioncs
2006-01-17T06:54:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	nope, the disk I'm trying to mount have windows
2006-01-17T06:56:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	It doesn't show any output, only showed the USB drive
2006-01-17T06:58:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	I have ubuntu installed on my slave disk "hdb"
2006-01-17T06:59:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	no. Strange, don't u think?
2006-01-17T07:00:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	 paste a copy of fstab into pastbin
2006-01-17T07:03:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	here you have it  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6978
2006-01-17T07:06:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	check out that url
2006-01-17T07:25:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	  check this url...
2006-01-17T07:26:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	I have it thank you. It seems the cable of the disk was bad connected.
2006-01-17T07:27:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	but now I can mount it but can't view the contents of the directory :/
2006-01-17T07:28:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	what command did you use to mount drive?
2006-01-17T07:28:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /home/luisito/Desktop/disco
2006-01-17T07:29:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	I also did sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/disco/
2006-01-17T07:30:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	I don't understand why It keeps telling me those things, I have done it before and worked great
2006-01-17T07:31:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	in hd and live cd versions
2006-01-17T07:32:00.000Z	navarone	luisito	you can get the drive to automount if you like...typw !diskmounter and go to url ubotu provides. You can dl a script that will edit your fstab and provide automounting. I have used twice and no probs
2006-01-17T07:36:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	now I did it with diskmounter and it worked.
2006-01-17T07:40:00.000Z	luisito	navarone	but now I'm intrigued why it didn't work?
