2007-01-26T10:41:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	useradd
2007-01-26T10:45:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	and you are typing the right password?
2007-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	go back into single user mode and use useradd to give yourself a home dir
2007-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	shifteh	DBO	: how do i give myself a homedir
2007-01-26T10:47:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	in all actuality useradd should have already made it...
2007-01-26T10:47:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	show me the entry in /etc/passwd for your new user
2007-01-26T10:49:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	cat /etc/passwd
2007-01-26T10:50:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	what distro are you using exactly?
2007-01-26T10:51:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	does "ls -l /home" show and entry edwin
2007-01-26T10:53:00.000Z	shifteh	DBO	: negative
2007-01-26T10:54:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	"sudo mkdir /home/edwin" then "sudo chown -R edwin:edwin /home/edwin"
2007-01-26T10:55:00.000Z	DBO	shifteh	if you look for the user with userid 1000 that was your first username made
