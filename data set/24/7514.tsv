2004-12-11T14:38:00.000Z	wig		hey, does ubuntu come with GCC?
2004-12-11T14:40:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	maybe you haven;t installed it?
2004-12-11T14:40:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	i thought it came standard.
2004-12-11T14:41:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	heh.. one must choose to install it, iirc
2004-12-11T14:41:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	it didn't give me any options.
2004-12-11T14:41:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	i just put the cd in, and it did whatever it does.
2004-12-11T14:41:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	damn.
2004-12-11T14:42:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	doesn't matter, i dont got internet connection on ubuntu

2004-12-11T14:43:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	eh?
2004-12-11T14:44:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	the packages should be on the cd. hence, if you setup apt to use the cd as a package src, then you should just be able to apt-get install gcc
2004-12-11T14:47:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	you're best in asking how to setup a cd as a package source
2004-12-11T14:47:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	how do i setupi a cd as a package source
2004-12-11T14:53:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	apt-cdrom add; apt-get install gcc
2004-12-11T14:53:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	alrighty
2004-12-11T14:56:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	like i said earlier:: GET gcc installed first!
2004-12-11T14:57:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	i just want all my info right now, cause it's a bitch rebooting
2004-12-11T14:57:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	reboot what? after installing gcc?
2004-12-11T14:57:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	im on windows now
2004-12-11T14:59:00.000Z	freakabcd	wig	those will work like a charm!

2004-12-11T14:59:00.000Z	wig	freakabcd	but goddam 2.6.n is tuff.
