2011-07-20T03:30:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	make all the numbers different
2011-07-20T03:31:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	the Pin-Priority settings?
2011-07-20T03:31:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	twice 1000 is it good?
2011-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	it seems that there's no package available for it in natty-security
2011-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	if i comment out the natty-security entry then it works
2011-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	but what if a natty security package is introduced in the future?
2011-07-20T03:34:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	that's mine yesterday pinning prefs http://paste.ubuntu.com/647719/ but i can't make it usefull
2011-07-20T03:35:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	aptitude search puppet
2011-07-20T03:39:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	this works: http://paste.ubuntu.com/647723/
2011-07-20T03:39:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	but i guess that works before there's no puppet package available in natty-security? what if an update is published there
2011-07-20T03:40:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	no package?
2011-07-20T03:40:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	it is in (debian) testing now, i think it must be in Natty
2011-07-20T03:40:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	i'm saying i think it's in natty, but not in natty-security
2011-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	%
2011-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	so i have to comment out those lines (see pasebin) for natty-security, then it works when i try "apt-get install puppet"
2011-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	so make 400 401 500 501 why not?
2011-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	but this means that i'm ignoring any security updates for the package that might be published in the future?
2011-07-20T03:43:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	oh yeah u have commented'em
2011-07-20T03:43:00.000Z	jefimenko	wechat	it breaks if i uncomment it and set the priorities to 400, 401, 500, 501
2011-07-20T03:44:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	hm why not to use something like hold in dpkg or aptitude ?
2011-07-20T03:45:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	hardly say for me i never use it. it is in debian "apt-get -t stable install package" but for you ...
2011-07-20T03:47:00.000Z	wechat	jefimenko	"aptitude  forbid-version" - this is what u need?
