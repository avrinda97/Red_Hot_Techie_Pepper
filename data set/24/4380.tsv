2007-04-30T06:08:00.000Z	renato_		hi there !
2007-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	renato_		I am kind of desperate... I just installed xubuntu in my wife's (very old) notebook, but I cant set up its internet connection
2007-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	renato_		I am using a motorola 5120 cable modem
2007-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	renato_		someone could help ?
2007-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	are you using dhcp ? if so plugging in the cable should make it 'just work'
2007-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- how can I check if the dhcp is enabled?
2007-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	im not sure about xfce's network tools, but you can check manually by looking at /etc/network/interfaces
2007-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- I am opening the file right now
2007-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- just one sec please
2007-04-30T06:11:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	no prob
2007-04-30T06:12:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- there isn't any reference to dhcp... the content of this file is: auto lo  and iface lo inet loopback
2007-04-30T06:12:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	is there anything else in the file? it should show eth0 or another device for your ethernet / wireless adapter
2007-04-30T06:12:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- nope
2007-04-30T06:13:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- just that
2007-04-30T06:13:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	hmm then maybe the network connection is not detected
2007-04-30T06:13:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	can you run the following commands and pastebin the output, sudo ifconfig and sudo lspci and sudo lsmod
2007-04-30T06:13:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- ok
2007-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- sorry for the delay... I had to run the commands in her computer, copy into a usb key so than I could send it to you
2007-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- do you mind if I send you this file (result.txt) ?
2007-04-30T06:24:00.000Z	sn0	renato_	put the text onto a pastebin
2007-04-30T06:25:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- sorry mate... but I am kind of newbie here... what is a pastebin ?
2007-04-30T06:26:00.000Z	renato_	sn0	- so... I just post the content of this file, here... is it correct ?
