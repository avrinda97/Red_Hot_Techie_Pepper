2008-07-21T22:57:00.000Z	rgravener1		my sudo apt-get install letter <tab> isn't functioning, any suggestions?
2008-07-21T22:58:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	does   sudo apt-get in<tab> work?
2008-07-21T23:02:00.000Z	rgravener1	unop	no
2008-07-21T23:02:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	and you are logged on as your current user right? not root?
2008-07-21T23:02:00.000Z	rgravener1		i'm on as root
2008-07-21T23:03:00.000Z	rgravener1		command line only
2008-07-21T23:03:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	how did you become root?
2008-07-21T23:03:00.000Z	rgravener1	unop	just wiped the system clean and i'm root, haven't set up any users yet
2008-07-21T23:04:00.000Z	rgravener1		ok i logged in as a differnt user
2008-07-21T23:04:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	i'm not sure how you got to be where you are now .. but anyway,   source /etc/bash_completion  # if the file does not exist, install the bash_completion package and try again
2008-07-21T23:05:00.000Z	rgravener1		whats the easiest way to add a user to sudoers
2008-07-21T23:05:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	make him a member of the admin group
2008-07-21T23:06:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	well, if you installed ubuntu normally, you shouldn't have to do this
2008-07-21T23:07:00.000Z	rgravener1	unop	its a server and i didn't install it.
2008-07-21T23:07:00.000Z	rgravener1		slicehost let me choose from a few os's and i picked ubuntu since its like debian
2008-07-21T23:07:00.000Z	rgravener1		but obviously they give me a bare bones setup
2008-07-21T23:08:00.000Z	rgravener1		one more question, how do I add a user to a group?
2008-07-21T23:08:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	ok, well, by default - member of the admin group can use sudo - perhaps its the way you do it on a slicehost setup too
2008-07-21T23:08:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	sudo adduser user group
2008-07-21T23:08:00.000Z	rgravener1		i made a group sudoers
2008-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	usually there is no sudoers group unless one was made
2008-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	rgravener1	unop	yea i'm going to add the sudoers group to the sudoers file
2008-07-21T23:10:00.000Z	unop	rgravener1	well, check if the admin group exists and is in the sudoers file -- that should works instead of creating a new group
2008-07-21T23:10:00.000Z	rgravener1	unop	nah its not there, only root
