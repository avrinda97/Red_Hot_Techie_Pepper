2008-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gamerguy2k8	 you might want to check the ubuntu forums for your specific chipset.
2008-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis		I dont use intel. so cant say much more then ti suggest that.
2008-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		no i know my chipset supports 3d, it works in suse out of the box
2008-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!intel
2008-05-01T18:21:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		i just dont know where in gnome to go to actually change my settings
2008-05-01T18:21:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		ive never used gnome
2008-05-01T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gamerguy2k8	 if you knew the proper name of the driver to put in the xorg.conf - you could just edit the xorg.conf - or use the command like tool to  reconfigure X.
2008-05-01T18:21:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		lol i have no idea what that means willis
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		and pici, hardware drivers says theres no proprietary drivers installed in my system
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		im given no option to change any
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8	bazhang	theres no way to change my video card driver in there i already looked
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		intel GMAX3100 aka GMA965 chipset pici
2008-05-01T18:22:00.000Z	gamerguy2k8		3d works out of the box in suse so i dont see why it shouldnt in ubuntu
2008-05-01T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gamerguy2k8	 because suse may of configured somthing differently, or included some drivers that ubunt couldent.
