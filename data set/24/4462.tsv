2009-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	what are you trying to do?
2009-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	http://www.haskell.org/soe/software1.htm, and specifically, add something to my path var
2009-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	for permanent purposes?
2009-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	ie. through logouts/reboots
2009-01-07T09:33:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	yeah, i think so
2009-01-07T09:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	so you need to edit .bashrc in your home directory
2009-01-07T09:34:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	well, i'm not sure if this value only is used by the install script, or if its used by the program itself later
2009-01-07T09:34:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	oh let me look
2009-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	nah it looks like you only need it for the install
2009-01-07T09:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	so you would just do ...
2009-01-07T09:36:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	ok, trying now
2009-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	i believe the path i want to add is /usr/lib64/ghc-6.8.2, does that look right to you?
2009-01-07T09:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	ummm /usr/lib/ is already in your path I think
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	if you just install ghc from the repos, it should be in your path
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	Its in the repositories
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	sudo apt-get install ghc
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	yes, that's what i did
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	then its in your path already
2009-01-07T09:38:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	ok, so it looks like i don't need to do anything for step one?
2009-01-07T09:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	yes
2009-01-07T09:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	you should be good
2009-01-07T09:40:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	hm, actually it looks like some problem has been miraculously solved.  perhaps the opengl package that i had installed needed a hibernate to kick in or something
2009-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	pyrak	Cpudan80	pm
2009-01-07T09:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	pyrak	go ahead
