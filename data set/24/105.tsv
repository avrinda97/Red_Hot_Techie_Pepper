2012-08-19T03:25:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Try to check with "xset m" if you can modify the mouse pointer speed.
2012-08-19T03:34:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	any tips on what numbers to give it?  the slightest movement on the touchpad makes the mouse cursor jump many pixels
2012-08-19T03:34:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Did you try the command I suggested?
2012-08-19T03:35:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	xset m?  yeah playing with it now
2012-08-19T03:37:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	it actually seems more precise vertically
2012-08-19T03:42:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Well, you may need to create an xorg.conf file. Pease can you let me know your ThinkPad X model again?
2012-08-19T03:42:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	X230
2012-08-19T03:49:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	According to my finding it shoudl use the synaptics driver.
2012-08-19T03:52:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	I mentioned this because it could have been detected as PS/2 Mouse.
2012-08-19T03:53:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	'xinput' shows SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad
2012-08-19T03:55:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Excellent. Now we need to figure out if X loads the driver. Can you check with your Xorg.0.log in /var/log? It shoudl tell how the drivers are loaded.
2012-08-19T03:57:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Also, you may need to create an xorg.log (Xorg :1 -configure > ~/xorg.conf.new) as root
2012-08-19T03:57:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	yeah it looks like the synaptic driver, x-axis range 1472-5768, y-axis 1408-5062
2012-08-19T04:02:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	That means you're almost there. Once you have created the file check if you're not using an xorg.conf already. The file is in /etc/X11. If not you can copy your ~/xorg.conf.new to /etc/X11/xorg.conf. With this nothing will have changed yet. You then need to see if there are parameters to modify the settings. On a side note, can we be sure the driver isn't loaded twice?
2012-08-19T04:03:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	should it be in lsmod?
2012-08-19T04:04:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Not sure if it is displayed twice. I can't check as I dont have hardware and the issue. Just give it a try.
2012-08-19T04:08:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	the generated xorg file doesn't mention synaptic
2012-08-19T04:10:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	That's odd. Can you pastebin the newly created xorg.conf please?
2012-08-19T04:12:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	http://pastebin.com/Te893NQB
2012-08-19T04:13:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	I can't look up at the moment. :-( The network link is too slow. The ISP is working on their routers.
2012-08-19T04:17:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	I recommend you sum up what's been done and refer to the pastebin output. I can't help you with it any further as I have uplink issues.
2012-08-19T04:18:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	could be related to HorizResolution property of the synaptic driver, trying to figure out how to experiment with it
2012-08-19T04:19:00.000Z	W4sp	ianm_	Cool, you'll get there. I'm sure. That shoudl address the issue.
2012-08-19T04:24:00.000Z	ianm_	W4sp	thanks for the help
