2005-06-28T15:03:00.000Z	Crasp		hi.
2005-06-28T15:04:00.000Z	Crasp		for some reason i cannot change my search engine in firefox on ubuntu
2005-06-28T15:04:00.000Z	Crasp		any idea how to fix this?
2005-06-28T15:04:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	how are yo utrying to do it?
2005-06-28T15:05:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	using the search bar that ships with the default firefox
2005-06-28T15:05:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	normally i could change search engines in it, but for some reason my ubuntu install doesn't allow me
2005-06-28T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	you're not being specific enough.  clickiong on the magnifying glass should show you a menu.
2005-06-28T15:07:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	lol not specific enough?
2005-06-28T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	... does that not work?
2005-06-28T15:08:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	i don't see a magnifying glass
2005-06-28T15:08:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	i mean the default search bar that is on the right of the address bar on the default firefox install
2005-06-28T15:08:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	normally i can see icons there (google, other random search engines)
2005-06-28T15:09:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	but i can't choose any other search engine cause i don't see any icons, neither will it let me change it in any way
2005-06-28T15:09:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	that's very odd, I don't know what could do that
2005-06-28T15:10:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	well i was hoping it was a known issue :)
2005-06-28T15:23:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	apparently it was my theme that destroyed the magnifying glass icon :/
2005-06-28T15:25:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	yeah, sorry. On other installs the theme works without any problems tho
2005-06-28T15:25:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	perhaps it has something to do with ubuntu still using 1.0.2 or so and the theme that is perhaps only 1.0.4 compatible
2005-11-06T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	it's known to be basically useless, yes
2005-11-06T15:07:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	is there any way i can fix it?
2005-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	Crasp	get rid of it and use the mplayer mozilla plugin, I'd think
2005-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	hmm ok i'll try that then
2005-11-06T15:22:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	do you perhaps have any idea how i tell firefox to not use totem but mplayer?
2005-11-06T15:22:00.000Z	Crasp	bob2	i installed mozilla-mplayer
