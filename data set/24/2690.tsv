2009-04-23T20:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tanveer	might have some issues with  upgrading now though, since download servers are packed
2009-04-23T20:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tanveer	also if you want the new optional  Ext4 file system, you got to clean install really, and set up those partitions yourself

2009-05-22T00:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tanveer	Berl was a fork of Compiz Fushion,  and they became one  quite a while ago, so Beryl is no longer made

2009-05-25T01:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tanveer	yeah adding shortcuts/launchers for stuff,  that's something Windows does better,  it's a little confussing with Gnome,  maybe not so bad with KDE, but probably similar
2009-05-25T01:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tanveer	where is your PSP folder?
