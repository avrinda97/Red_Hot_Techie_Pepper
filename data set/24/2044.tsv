2009-10-09T02:20:00.000Z	GhostDog		Hi, I think I have a problem with a simple solution. I have intel graphics and was using the bleeder updates and the latest one killed X.. or something. Check out http://pastebin.com/d7cc54391 for the x failsafe log
2009-10-09T02:21:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	that version was built under a xen kernel ... you arn't running xen are you?
2009-10-09T02:22:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	not to my knowledge. virtualbox?
2009-10-09T02:22:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	bad driver version, not going to work ... are you running virtualbox?
2009-10-09T02:23:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	im running off low graphics mode atm. yes i run virtualbox
2009-10-09T02:23:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	vbox within ubuntu ... or ubuntu within vbox?
2009-10-09T02:24:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	vbox within ubuntu
2009-10-09T02:24:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	windows xp guest
2009-10-09T02:25:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	go into synaptic ... remove the bleeder, then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-intel
2009-10-09T02:26:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	will do thanks
2009-10-09T02:26:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	np
2009-10-09T02:28:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	I ran the commandline, it thought for about one and a half one-one-thousands, no output. Is that right?
2009-10-09T02:29:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	yep, now go into your /etc/X11 directory and look for  a backup file of xorg.conf that is older than your error and rename it to xorg.conf and restart X
2009-10-09T02:29:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	thanks
2009-10-09T02:34:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	terribly sorry but could you please tell me how to rename the file in the command line, i can't do it with gui as it is root
2009-10-09T02:36:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.whateveritis  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-09T02:36:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	looks good
2009-10-09T02:45:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	any luck?
2009-10-09T02:45:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	heya. looks like a kernel problem.
2009-10-09T02:45:00.000Z	fccf	GhostDog	what kernel do you have ... uname -a
2009-10-09T02:46:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	actually i also booted into an old kernel with grub come to think of it. let me try a normal boot
2009-10-09T02:54:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	oops. ill bother you again after i try to reinstall the driver
2009-10-09T02:58:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	all right, i'm at a loss. I believe the problem is it is not recognizing the driver or no driver is installed or something similar. on boot up i get error can't find intel EE 00 or something similar and then it goes into what seems to be some sort of lesser back up GUI where I can 'reconfigure graphics settings' 'troubleshoot' 'drop to commandline' etc
2009-10-09T03:00:00.000Z	GhostDog	fccf	I should rprobably also mention that for months I have been getting error 26fs where I can continue by hitting space or pick a graphics mode. i hit space and it works fine. this was after some particular bleeder upgrade.
