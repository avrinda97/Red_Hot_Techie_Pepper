2010-01-08T20:38:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	how do you install ubuntu???
2010-01-08T20:38:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	boot to CD, format the old dog, and ta da!
2010-01-08T20:38:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	thats what i am having prob with
2010-01-08T20:39:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	oh sorry I may have missed some stuff, I just saw issues with the LIVE CD demo... let me go back and read through all of the convo
2010-01-08T20:41:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	so you have tried the install option too? You only mentioned that the demo wouldn't boot...
2010-01-08T20:42:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	yeah i did try to install and some thing  happens
2010-01-08T20:43:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	ah okay... well it most likely either a) doesn't have the juice or b) some hardware is not compatible
2010-01-08T20:44:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	but question, i am downloading the srvr edition now... and it is amd64, the srvr is 32bit intel...
2010-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	won't run
2010-01-08T20:45:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	so what you suggest then me to do
2010-01-08T20:47:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	hold the phones... do you have a quad core Xeon in there?
2010-01-08T20:47:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	or is it the older server?
2010-01-08T20:48:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	its a Dell Power Edge with pentium D
2010-01-08T20:49:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	okay so you need to DL the 32bit ISO for ubuntu, althought I don't recommend server for daily use... unless you are familiar with CLI and ubuntu in general
2010-01-08T20:49:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	and depending on what your goals are with this box, fileserver? webserver? other?
2010-01-08T20:51:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	looks like i am going back to Debian
2010-01-08T20:53:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	http://www.ubuntu.com/GetUbuntu/download
2010-01-08T20:59:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	you said it was 32bit
2010-01-08T21:00:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kneeskrap3r	typo i apologize
2010-01-08T21:00:00.000Z	kneeskrap3r	McL0VIN	no prob, the other thing is that a Pent D is 32bit in my xp... so I think you do want 32, not to mention that 32 still runs on 64 hardware :) :)
