2011-02-08T00:50:00.000Z	Kingsy		I could just do a standard erase/install but that means I wouldnt have sda as /home which would be nice
2011-02-08T00:50:00.000Z	Kingsy		could someone offer some advice on how I cuold do this?
2011-02-08T00:51:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	i just do / and swap :)
2011-02-08T00:51:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- what do you mean?
2011-02-08T00:51:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- I know there is no need but for my circumstance it would be very useful
2011-02-08T00:54:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- you tell me is this correct          sda1 ext4 format /home      sdb1 ext3 format /boot        sdb5 format swap     sdb6 ext4 format /   Bootloader:Device for bootloader installation    /dev/sdb
2011-02-08T00:54:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	no, it formats your home
2011-02-08T00:55:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- I don't need a backup.. this is a clean install
2011-02-08T00:56:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	ok then it looks fine. you dont really need /boot
2011-02-08T00:56:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- ok, and I am right in saying  bootloader installation would be /dev/sdb    ?
2011-02-08T00:57:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- no, I would never use grub rescue I am just trying to boot the system
2011-02-08T00:57:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	well you don't need /boot but it doesn't harm either.
2011-02-08T00:58:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- well if you you are saying is true then it doesnt work.. I have done that 5 times
2011-02-08T00:59:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	dont what 5 times? that setup?
2011-02-08T00:59:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- yup
2011-02-08T00:59:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- sdb is 16GB sda 4GB
2011-02-08T01:00:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	2 GB swap on sdb, remaining 14 GB / ... sda = /home. install bootloader to sdb
2011-02-08T01:01:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- done that.. it doesnt work
2011-02-08T01:01:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- perhaps it was cos I had a /boot partition could that cause it to fail?
2011-02-08T01:02:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	how did it fail?
2011-02-08T01:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- when I booted up it said it couldnt find grub then gave me a grub rescue prompt
2011-02-08T01:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	genjix	- 5 times in a row
2011-02-08T01:03:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	ok do this then. im not sure how to do it in the ubuntu installer then mark the / parittion as bootable
2011-02-08T01:05:00.000Z	genjix	Kingsy	oh yeah you need to change your BIOS to boot sdb first
