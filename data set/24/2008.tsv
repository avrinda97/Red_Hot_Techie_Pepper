2009-11-28T11:32:00.000Z	blz		Is there an equivalent of Acronis TrueImage for ubuntu?  I've heard good things about clonezilla and dd_rescue, but I'm looking for something with compression, scheduling, and incremental backup capabilities.  Does this exist?
2009-11-28T11:33:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	partimage is cool for backups too.
2009-11-28T11:34:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	look in software center for backup. There are many I believe.
2009-11-28T11:34:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Im not sure many of them have ext4 support yet.
2009-11-28T11:35:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 aah good point. it's still pretty new
2009-11-28T11:35:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	I simple drag and drop of your home folder to an external drive is so easy to do.
2009-11-28T11:35:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 yeah, i do like the idea of byte-for-byte backup though
2009-11-28T11:36:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	byet for byte is what dd does and it is very unefficient use of space unless you pipe it to gzip etc.
2009-11-28T11:45:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	If grid gets updated with screen edge optiosn then the keystrokes are the only option at the moment.
2009-11-28T11:37:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Your probably not gonna get a byte for byte incremental backup solution cause the file system has to be unmounted. So not possible.
2009-11-28T11:38:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 i realize that linux is not windows, but doesn't acronis do byte-for-byte on a mounted filesystem?
2009-11-28T11:38:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Apples to Oranges
2009-11-28T11:39:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Why would you want to backup empty sectors anyways?
2009-11-28T11:39:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 well i don't.  I really just want to back up the entire system. config files, apps, data, etc...
2009-11-28T11:40:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Back In Time is mentioned by Robby Ferguson on category5.tv and its supposed to look for new files on the system and back em up for you. Check that out.
2009-11-28T11:40:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 that sounds very interesting actually

2009-11-28T11:42:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	Compiz plugin named Grid does just that with simple numpad keystrokes.
2009-11-28T11:43:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	 but it's keystrokes only?  i guess that's better than nothing
2009-11-28T11:44:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	CTRL+ALT+numpad4 will switch the window to left side of screen and goes between 1/2, 1/3 of screen etc.
2009-11-28T11:44:00.000Z	blz	linuxguy2009	hmm no numpad though
2009-11-28T11:45:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	set your own keystrokes.
2009-11-28T11:46:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	I use that plugin all of the time when multitasking instead of manually resizing all my windows to see them all.
2009-11-28T11:47:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	blz	BTW Im sure the grid plugin does much more than win7 does. It can split the screen in 1/4, 1/3, 1/2.
