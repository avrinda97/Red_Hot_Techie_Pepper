2006-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Xoritor		anyone using dapper (amd64) having issues with nvidia drivers
2006-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Xoritor		?
2006-04-25T08:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	Dapper recently upgraded nvidia driver and some people are having problems. Try #ubuntu+1
2006-04-25T08:26:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	no one is answering me over there... so i tried here ;-)
2006-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	Well I broke mine with the nvidia package, so now I am soley using that (I don;t want to upgrade my kernel just for nvidia driver)
2006-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	Only problem is Xgl doesn't work now. Oh well, it's too young at the moment
2006-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	lol
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	yea... i hear ya
2006-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	i dont care bout it too much but would like to have the ability to play nwn this weekend...
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	Well you can get the nvidia package and give it the option "--x-module-dir=/usr/lib/Xorg/modules" or something very similar. You won't have Xgl though
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	i dont care about xgl
2006-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	i just care about glx
2006-04-25T08:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	Then use that. Just remembered it's "modules" not "module" though. That's what was up with it
2006-04-25T08:30:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	what package the one from invidia?
2006-04-25T08:31:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	And be glad that I told you that option. Then you won't have to look through IRC logs in a console. I mean the official ".run" file from their site
2006-04-25T08:31:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	cool beans superaman... you rock!
2006-04-25T08:31:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	that wont hork anything else will it?
2006-04-25T08:31:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	I think that was a compliment. Than you
2006-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	lol... sorry im a bit goofy this evening
2006-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	I haven't had any problems. It's just that the option which gets it to work also restricts it to Xorg only (bye bye Xgl)
2006-04-25T08:33:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	no problems there, i just want a bit of nwn for the weekend ;-)
2006-04-25T08:40:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	thanks again!
2006-04-25T08:40:00.000Z	Xoritor	Warbo	ill give that a shot if its not "fixed" before my nwn fest this weekend
2006-04-25T08:40:00.000Z	Warbo	Xoritor	OK, but if you do then keep the NVidia .run file so you can use --uninstall
