2010-07-03T13:05:00.000Z	xtheunknown0		I can't login!
2010-07-03T13:06:00.000Z	xtheunknown0		Can someone please help me with my login problems?
2010-07-03T13:08:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	also try "failsafe" option in the login window
2010-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	did you try the "failsafe" option in the login window?
2010-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	it's in the session drop down box iirc
2010-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	where you type your username/password, there should be a drop down box for session, and in there, there should be a "safe" option or some such
2010-07-03T13:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	i don't use gdm, but i think it's a different drop down box than that
2010-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	there are no other clickable items on my login screen
2010-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	i'm pretty sure there is, make sure your username is selected, and i think it's along the bottom
2010-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	- Well it isn't - it's just language and keyboard - not that different to http://images.pcworld.com/howto/graphics/158059-Ubuntu-18-Login-Screen_copy_350.jpg after clicking on username
2010-07-03T13:23:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	in that version, you would use the "Select Session..." option in the menu, but i think the new version is a bit different
2010-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	for example, this: http://ubuntu-pics.de/bild/20128/gdm_screenshot_buzQpR.png  do you see the Sessions drop down?
2010-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	no
2010-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	or with the default theme: http://www.debianadmin.com/wp-content/gallery/1004/1.png
2010-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	no again
2010-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	i suppose it's possible you delete gnome.  you could try to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package and have it dragged back in
2010-07-03T13:30:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	other than reinstalling gnome (as above), I'm not sure what else you could do.
2010-07-03T13:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	like i said before, you're best bet is probably just to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package to drag in all the crap you probably need to get up and running (ie. gnome)
2010-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	the mirror works fine here through firefox, are you connected to the net?  can you ping that address?
2010-07-03T14:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	try pinging google.com or other websites
2010-07-03T14:11:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	is there no way to use a hard wired connection temporarily?
2010-07-03T14:12:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	Oh ok
2010-07-03T14:25:00.000Z	codebrainz	xtheunknown0	have you run apt-get update? does that run fine?
2010-07-03T14:25:00.000Z	xtheunknown0	codebrainz	no, lol
