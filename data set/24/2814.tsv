2008-08-30T20:28:00.000Z	saiki		how does one make a zip/tar/rar a .deb?
2008-08-30T20:28:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	I told you before.  Did you read the documentation ubottu sent you?
2008-08-30T20:29:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	yes, but it didn't make sense to me
2008-08-30T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	you should ask questions about what didn't make sense then...
2008-08-30T20:30:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	I'm not linux-smart, I'm trying to be though
2008-08-30T20:30:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	nd um... none of it made sense..
2008-08-30T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	then you need to start somewhere else
2008-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	trying to get 2 more things done, idjc 0.7.9 and dolphin
2008-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	don't know what those are, try asking the channel
2008-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	if I knew how to .deb things it would make installing them MUCH easier
2008-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	idjc is a dj client similar to windows's SAM, and dolphin in a gamecube emulator
2008-08-30T20:36:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	and the idjc in the repos is .4, the new ones are out
2009-04-29T04:52:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	non-system deb isn't really well-defined, but no, you have no guarantee that they will work.  What exactly are you trying to do?
2009-04-29T04:53:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	I'm refering to things like singularity and scatterbrauten (a 1st person shooter)
2009-04-29T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	sauerbraten?
2009-04-29T04:54:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	sauerbraten_0.0.20080620.dfsg-1_i386
2009-04-29T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	sauerbraten is in the repositories
2009-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	I have a backup of the things I installed on ibex
2009-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	what is the issue with installing from the repositories?
2009-04-29T04:55:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	long story, but I'd like to save time
2009-04-29T04:56:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	then check if the dependencies are satisfied... try to install it and see if gdebi complains
2009-04-29T04:56:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	I know I have them. I was just wondering if it's safe to install them
2009-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	saiki	as long as you read what I just said, yes
2009-04-29T04:57:00.000Z	saiki	jrib	okies, thx
