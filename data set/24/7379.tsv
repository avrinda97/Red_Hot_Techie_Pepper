2005-10-19T14:06:00.000Z	sally_		anyone who has some crap looking fonts and font sizes in firefox give this a try: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts ... who knows why it's not done by default
2005-10-19T07:54:00.000Z	sally_		when I go to add applications and search for apt, the package apt-listchanges doesn't show up, but from a console I can do sudo apt-get install apt-listchanges and it is downloaded and installed.  Why doesn't apt-listchanges show up in "add applications"
2005-10-19T07:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	becuse if all the apps available were there, you would have 17 000 choices :)
2005-10-19T07:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	everything shows in synaptic package manager though
2005-10-19T07:57:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	do you know what the criteria is for allowing packages to show up there?  or where I can find it?
2005-10-19T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	no, sorry - but if you want to browse, just use the more advanced synaptic
2005-10-19T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	I believe there's an "advvnced" button in breezy that starts synaptic anyway
2005-10-19T07:59:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	ok  thanks.  yeah I found it
2005-10-19T07:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	 :)
2005-10-19T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	supported packages
2005-10-19T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	i.e. ones in the "main" repo
2005-10-19T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	the others are "community supported"
2005-10-19T08:25:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	ok thanks
2005-10-25T05:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	once a new version is released, only bug fixes and security updates
2005-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	if you want constant new stuff, you would track the new development version
2005-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	is that ubuntu's version of debian unstable?
2005-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	not exactly, no
2005-10-25T05:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	it's the development version which would release each 6 months
2005-10-25T05:53:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	oh I see... do you use it?  is its stability comparable to that of debian unstable?
2005-10-25T05:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	ubuntu uses a different model from debian's
2005-10-25T05:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	no, I'm still using the older version ;) But breezy is "stable"
2005-10-25T05:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	the new dev version will be "dapper"
2005-10-25T05:54:00.000Z	sally_	thoreauputic	have they started dapper yet
2005-10-25T05:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	sally_	I don't think so - it's only a few days since breezy was released
