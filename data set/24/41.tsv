2012-10-09T20:06:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	ikonia> I'd suggest removing those apache packages, clearing the cache and trying again  <--
2012-10-09T20:07:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	why do i have to remove the apache package
2012-10-09T20:07:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	ask ikonia, that's what ikonia suggested
2012-10-09T20:07:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	i an an nginx user, not apache :P
2012-10-09T20:08:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	where is ikonia  recommendation for me to remove the packages
2012-10-09T20:09:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	i think reading your scrollbacks might be a good idea :P
2012-10-09T20:10:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	 just be straight  why do i have scrollback
2012-10-09T20:10:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	if you know what to help me be open and not as done before
2012-10-09T20:11:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	i was being kind, giving you the scrollbacks of what ikonia said.  there's a *reason* scrollbacks exist.  ikonia gave you a suggested method, and a suggested possible cause, such that packages may have already been installed which therefore break things.  uninstalling, updating the apt data, and then reinstalling might fix it
2012-10-09T20:12:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	and the problem in ikonia comment  wasnt mentioned me in that post
2012-10-09T20:12:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	so in a sense, reiterating what ikonia said, whether i copy-paste scrollbacks or not, is actually trying to help
2012-10-09T20:12:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	that's not our problem?
2012-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	did you uninstall the apache packages first?
2012-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	nop
2012-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	i didn't
2012-10-09T20:22:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	you need to do that first, otherwise the older package data won't be cleared when you update the cache.
2012-10-09T20:22:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	then you need to clear the apt cache, and then update apt again
2012-10-09T20:22:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	otherwise it'll not do squat.
2012-10-09T20:23:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	i think you and ardchoille there is a difference with what you are telling me
2012-10-09T20:25:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	ardchoille tells me that to clear the cache and you u tell me to remove the package  first and then cache
2012-10-09T20:25:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	clearing the cache is the same thing, though.  and if you read the scrollbacks, ikonia suggested removing the packages as well
2012-10-09T20:25:00.000Z	chinneseproduct	TheLordOfTime	which one of can i follow
2012-10-09T20:27:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	chinneseproduct	i have to head to a dev meeting for a project I am on, i don't have the extra 12 minutes to give you the full command, and i'm actually late for that meeting :p
