2005-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	cache most likely.
2005-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	Also some memory is locked away in the kernel.

2005-09-14T07:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	free -mt usually makes the numbers add up (more correctly) iirc
2005-09-14T07:51:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	how are u @ keyboards ubuntu does not give me an option for a 85 key KB lots of apps dont work well because i had to chose the 102 key KB
2005-09-14T07:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	You'll need to try someone else or perhaps your favorite search engine. :)
2005-09-14T07:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	However I would believe that 85 key kbds would be supported in atleast us/uk layout.
2005-09-14T07:54:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	had no luck in 2 years searching just thought i ask thanx
2005-09-14T07:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	Well, I'm sorry I can't help. :)
2005-09-14T07:56:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	don't b sorry it will b worked out some day :)
2005-09-14T08:09:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	i foget what i dled but my screesaver is really awsome than the default gnome xsreensaver i dled mostly libs.
2005-09-14T08:01:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	elaborate on that
2005-09-14T08:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	on what?
2005-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	You can run a screen saver in the root window (desktop window) of X, however metacity or nautilus comandeer the root window and show their own (in this case not so nice) graphics there.
2005-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	If you try other windowmanagers that don't comandeer that window you can run /usr/lib/xscreensaver/glmatrix -root to put it in the root window for added eye candy points with the lads.
2005-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	There shoul (as in ought to be) a way to have metacity or nautilus release the root window so you could do that very same thing in gnome.
2005-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	I just don't know how.
2005-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	rafter	That good enough? :)
2005-09-14T08:12:00.000Z	rafter	BlueEagle	i do my best work when i'm drunk get nice results just cab't remember how
