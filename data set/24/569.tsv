2011-05-30T04:16:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	whats your wireless device chipset?
2011-05-30T04:17:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	I do not use wireless
2011-05-30T04:17:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	oh ok, thought you said you had a wireless prob.
2011-05-30T04:19:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	thanks anyways...it is not really a problem just was curious why my ip is different in xubuntu than it is in windows
2011-05-30T04:19:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	hard telling... most routers you can tell them to assign an IP to a particular PC.
2011-05-30T04:20:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	if you've not manually assigned IP's from the router, maybe something had the other Ip occupied when you turned on Ubuntu?..
2011-05-30T04:20:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	no router either
2011-05-30T04:20:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	no router?.. then how do you have an IP.
2011-05-30T04:21:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	dhcp enabled get ip from cable company
2011-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	if it is giving you a wireless signal, it is a combination router/modem
2011-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	can you connect more than 1 device at a time to it?
2011-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	no wireless and no I can only connect my computer to it
2011-05-30T04:26:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	meaning, can you have more than 1 wireless device, or 1 wired and 1 wirelss, device.
2011-05-30T04:27:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	can you look at the model name/number on the router and tell me what it is... i find that pretty hard to believe
2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	all it says on a lable is ambit and it only has one input from you ethernet cable
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	ok, can you have a wired connection, and a wireless connection? (at the same time?)
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	no
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	wel, i'd be really interested in hear the model # of that router.
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	the strange thing is if I do a cold boot I get the same ip as windows
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	i dunno, what you're saying really doesn't make sense
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	is it giving you a 192.168.x.x IP?
2011-05-30T04:32:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	no- it has nothing to do with an internal ip - it is only the public ip that changes...like I said it is not a problem I was just curious as to why
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	KM0201	lapaga	dunno, hard telling
2011-05-30T04:34:00.000Z	lapaga	KM0201	if you do a whois on me...the ip that is showing is not the same as windows is what I mean
