2007-10-07T06:22:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	well hold on
2007-10-07T06:26:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	I can't seem to find anything did you try using the restricted drivers manager?
2007-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	bug #98641
2007-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	there is a fix for it.
2007-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	you need a file out of the nvidia.com driver  there are directions on the bug for a fix
2007-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	no
2007-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	it should be a launchpad site
2007-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	launchpad.net/98641
2007-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	sry launchpad.net/bugs/98641
2007-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	they basically explain downloadign the nvidia drivers extracting the contents and copying the proper file.  I'm assuming you'll still need nvidia-glx-new installed for this to work.  but the page will be more helpfull
2007-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	its the driver but its missing a file.  Just double check the bug and make sure you need that for the fix to work.
2007-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	its an older version
2007-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	DARKGuy controlling it using screen might be an issue but youu could certainly start another X on the other vc
2007-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	I dunno if I would create the link like he did I would cp the file there.
2007-10-07T06:53:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	sudo cp /home/sarah/libnvidia-wfb.so.1.0blah /usr/lib/xorg/modules
2007-10-07T06:53:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	then make the link from /usr/lib/xorg/modules/libnvidia-blah to /usr/lib/xor/modules/libwfb.so
2007-10-07T06:54:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	the version may be different on yoru file also try using tab completeion  typing the first part of the filename and hitting tab
2007-10-07T06:55:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	the name isn't blah
2007-10-07T06:55:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	type in sudo cp /home/what ever your username is/libnvi(tab>  hit the tab k to autocomplete
2007-10-07T06:56:00.000Z	h1st0	Sarah	also dpeends on where you extracted  it.
