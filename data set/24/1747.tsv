2010-05-09T11:07:00.000Z	musca	robertzaccour	broken download, burnt to broken cdrom
2010-05-09T11:07:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	memory on one netbook is 512mb on the other is 1gb
2010-05-09T11:08:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	what am i looking for in memtest?
2010-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	musca	robertzaccour	memtest list errors in red colour
2010-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	it doesn't list anything
2010-05-09T11:10:00.000Z	musca	robertzaccour	let it test at least 15 minutes
2010-05-09T11:11:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	could it possibly be a bad flash drive?
2010-05-09T11:13:00.000Z	musca	robertzaccour	well, it is possible, but more likely a broken download
2010-05-09T11:13:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	i first tried downloading it and using startup disc creator, then that didn't work so i deleted the download and had unetbootin download and mount it for me, and same issue
2010-05-09T11:16:00.000Z	musca	robertzaccour	well - maybe unetbootin failed? i didn't try it with lucid
2010-05-09T11:16:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	unetbootin was the second method i tried, first was download and mount with SDC
2010-05-09T11:23:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	still no errors
2010-05-09T11:23:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	on the memtest i mean
2010-05-09T11:36:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	i did yet a 3rd download and same thing. could it be the download mirror?
2010-05-09T12:29:00.000Z	robertzaccour	musca	i keep having that same issue. i'm downloading from the canada mirror now
