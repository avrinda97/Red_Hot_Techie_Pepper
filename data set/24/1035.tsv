2010-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	rodeo_		Hi!
2010-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	rodeo_		  Any one for help please
2010-08-30T07:57:00.000Z	rodeo_		Ok! On desktop layout for applications, their is no search option in ubuntu?
2010-08-30T07:58:00.000Z	rodeo_		I am installing softwares, but they are not enlisted in the list, how do I find them
2010-08-30T07:58:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Tracker. That's what you'll want.
2010-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Alternatively, you can try Beagle. I don't myself use either service (I use Gnome-Do to search files), and I can't remember which was better.
2010-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	rodeo_	avi_	where do I get that 'Tracker"
2010-08-30T08:00:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	sudo apt-get install tracker beagle -- that would get you both.
2010-08-30T08:00:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Or pop up the Ubuntu Software Center and search for "beagle" or "tracker"
2010-08-30T08:01:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Actually, i'd use beagle.
2010-08-30T08:01:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	I just checked, it's more integrated in the Gnome UI.
2010-08-30T08:01:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Sure thing.
2010-08-30T10:39:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Refresh my memory, who are you :-)
2010-08-30T10:39:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	ah ah ah! I remember. How'd that work out?
2010-08-30T10:40:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Right tracker and beagle.
2010-08-30T10:40:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Ah, like an application launcher?
2010-08-30T10:42:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Well I've no real experience in mint, not can I explain the software list not updating. however, I can say that a fantastic app launcher is Gnome-Do.
2010-08-30T10:43:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Simply start typing the name of an app, and it finds it and then hit enter to launch it.
2010-08-30T10:43:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	sudo apt-get install gnome-do
2010-08-30T10:43:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Or search in software center
2010-08-30T10:44:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	good luck!
2010-08-30T10:48:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Great! Gnome-Do is a fantasic little app, I use it 100x a day, seriously. :D
2010-08-30T10:49:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Lol you sound like me a year ago! Good luck man.
2010-08-30T10:50:00.000Z	avi_	rodeo_	Peace.
