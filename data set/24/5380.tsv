2006-08-10T13:44:00.000Z	cica		hi guys :-)
2006-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	cica		can anyone advise how to update/upgrade my Ubuntu box (totally new to this). Know it's apt-get or something similar...
2006-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	upgrade from what to what?
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	to the latest kernel
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	dont do any major upgrades from breezy to dapper or anything with those commands
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	but if you already have dapper it should be ok
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	I have Ubuntu 5.10
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	then you should check the wiki
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	wikipedia you mean?
2006-08-10T13:47:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	there is an entry for how to upgrade to dapper properly, if yournot careful you will screw up your system
2006-08-10T13:47:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-08-10T13:47:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	I appreciate that mate... I'll have a look :-)

2006-08-10T13:52:00.000Z	Intangir	cica	you updating now?
2006-08-10T13:54:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	no... downloading image from: http://ftp.ticklers.org/releases.ubuntu.org/releases/6.06/.

2006-08-10T13:56:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	ok I'll take a look again
2006-08-10T14:09:00.000Z	cica	Intangir	think I've got it upgrading now. Made a few changes to the following file /etc/apt/sources.list and went ahead with sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
