2008-07-21T12:13:00.000Z	boGGdy		:( too much work. I have over 200 GB of stuff
2008-07-21T12:14:00.000Z	boGGdy		what if I drop in another HDD, an old IDE? would 13Gb be enough?
2008-07-21T12:14:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	plenty
2008-07-22T11:04:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	do you have more than one hd
2008-07-22T11:04:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	only one. i have removed the windows one (sata) to not mess up smething
2008-07-22T11:05:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	is your BIOS set to IDE
2008-07-22T11:06:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	like... to work with IDE devices?
2008-07-22T11:07:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	yes...might be that the BIOS is setting the drive to SATA
2008-07-22T11:07:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	in the POST screen i see my hdd on IDE
2008-07-22T11:09:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	I checked the partitions. they have /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2. shouldn't they be hda1 and hda2?
2008-07-22T11:13:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	still here?
2008-07-22T11:14:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	yes...I'm trying to come up with the easiest way to fix GRUB
2008-07-22T11:14:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	you seen my q about the partitions?
2008-07-22T11:15:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	kernel uses sda now for most hd configurations
2008-07-22T11:15:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	ok, i thought it was helping you  :(
2008-07-22T11:16:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	ubuntu boots live and installed correct
2008-07-22T11:18:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	yes, it does boot from live cd and I think it's installed correct, how do I know that?
2008-07-22T11:19:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	did you reconnect the drive before rebooting?
2008-07-22T11:22:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	need to make the drive master
2008-07-22T11:22:00.000Z	boGGdy	wbmj	and install again?
2008-07-22T11:25:00.000Z	wbmj	boGGdy	that's why I didn't want to recommend fixing Grub
