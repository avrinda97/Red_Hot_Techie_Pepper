2008-02-01T03:12:00.000Z	Dmole		can anyone tell me what is happening with the escape sequences in this BASH command?:          export com=`echo "$com" | perl -pi -w -e 's/\\/\\\\/g;'`;
2008-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	\\ is \
2008-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	yah I want \ to be replaced with  \\ but i get this error :         Substitution replacement not terminated at -e line 1.
2008-02-01T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	I don't know perl, but sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' should work
2008-02-01T03:15:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	VIM shows it as purple not the normal red for escape sequences
2008-02-01T03:16:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	hmm ok, maybe I'm wrong with sed (just tried).  Let me play
2008-02-01T03:22:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	hmm, no it's working fine with sed as I posted
2008-02-01T03:23:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	echo '\\\\' | perl -pi -w -e 's/\\/\\\\/g;'  works here too
2008-02-01T03:24:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	yah i think it's the export ''; that is messing up the escape
2008-02-01T03:25:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	the whole command was this:                  export com=`echo "$com" | perl -pi -w -e 's/\\/\\\\/g;'`;
2008-02-01T03:26:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	yeah, that's a pain.  You should try #bash
2008-02-01T03:27:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	lol silly me. thanks.
2008-02-01T03:31:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	good call they said: "\amethyst> Dmole: use $( ) instead"
2008-02-01T03:31:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	hmm, does that work?  I thought I tried that
2008-02-01T03:33:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	this worked:             export com=$(echo "$com" | perl -pi -w -e 's/\\/\\\\/g;');
2008-02-01T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	interesting, that works in bash, but not zsh
2009-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	mpd?
2009-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	mpd have dynamic playlists?
2009-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	what is a dynamic playlist?
2009-12-16T03:43:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	I want to be able to add tracks to a currently playing playlist from the CLI (I tried named pipes with mplayer buy it was fail)
2009-12-16T03:43:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	yeah you can do that of course
2009-12-16T03:44:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	nice I'll install it now and give it a try
2009-12-16T03:45:00.000Z	jrib	Dmole	mpd is the daemon, mpc is a nice client for creating binds, ncmpcpp and ncmpc are two nice cli clients, and sonata is a nice gtk client
2009-12-16T06:15:00.000Z	Dmole	jrib	mpd+mpc looks perfect but it's not working for me... did you have to do anything after install?
