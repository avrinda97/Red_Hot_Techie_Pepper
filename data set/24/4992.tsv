2007-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	the site you will be showing me output of the commands I tell you to run is paste.ubuntu-nl.org. I would like you to run sudo aptitude update in a terminal, and show me the output. Also, I would like to see the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list file on the same web site pastebin
2007-01-10T13:51:00.000Z	Tree	dabaR	its updating now u gave me that command but its still broken cos i cant use add/remove
2007-01-10T13:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	wait til it is done, and show me the output+sources.list in the pastebin.
2007-01-10T13:53:00.000Z	Tree	dabaR	what was the command to open sources.list with admin?
2007-01-10T13:54:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-10T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	close your synaptic.
2007-01-10T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	run sudo aptitude update again, and post the output of it again, and give me a link, pls.
2007-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	then close synaptic, run "sudo aptitude update;sudo aptitude -f install;sudo aptitude install -f;sudo apt-get -f install;sudo apt-get install -f"

2007-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	good work.
2007-01-10T14:30:00.000Z	Tree	dabaR	would you know how to install jdk??
2007-01-10T14:30:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	that is simple. I think...
2007-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	just install sun-java5-jdk through synaptic, after enabling the multiverse repository in synaptic.
2007-01-10T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	are you still trying to install the jdk?
2007-01-10T14:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	does aptitude search jdk return anything?
2007-01-10T14:39:00.000Z	dabaR	Tree	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, edit line "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe main restricted", change to "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe main restricted multiverse", save, close. run "sudo aptitude update". then see whether you get results from aptitude search jdk
