2006-06-16T12:14:00.000Z	ScatterBrain		I'm having trouble with Openssl, x509 certificates and Windows, someone wanna help?
2006-06-16T12:14:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	does it apply to ... Ubuntu?
2006-06-16T12:15:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	I'm creating the certificates on an Ubuntu server, trying to use them for an VPN running on Ubunutu.  And I can't find the OpenSSL channel.
2006-06-16T12:15:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	what's your problem?
2006-06-16T12:15:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	I don't know much about VPNs...but i know a little about openssl+apache
2006-06-16T12:16:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	following the guide written by Nate Carlson, I've created a CA, and self-signed certificates.  When I try to import them into my Windows clients, they say the CA isn't supposed to be creating certificates.
2006-06-16T12:17:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	Did you self sign the certs, or did you use the CA to sign the certs you generated yourself?
2006-06-16T12:17:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	I used the CA.
2006-06-16T12:18:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	so your windows client isn't trusting the CA?
2006-06-16T12:18:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	or does it say your CA wasn't supposed to sign certs? that wouldn't make sense -- that's the CA's jobs
2006-06-16T12:18:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	it says the latter.
2006-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	I know.  That's what's got me puzzled.
2006-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	you generated the .key via: openssl genrsa 512/1024 > whatever.key;openssl req -new -key whatever.key > whatever.csr
2006-06-16T12:20:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	then, using your existing CA, did: openssl ca -policy policy_anything -out whatever.crt -infiles whatever.csr
2006-06-16T12:20:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	No.  I used CA.sh -newca to generate the CA.  THen I used CA.sh -newreq to generate the client certificates.
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	try doing it the way i just said :)
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	Then I used CA.sh -sign to sign them.
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	that way you're generating the certs with SSL, and signing them with the CA
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	Spec		err, openssl*
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	OK.  I'l try.
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	you've done -newca?
2006-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	you do need to do that, in order to sign the .csr with your CA to produce a .crt :p
2006-06-16T12:22:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	Spec	Yeah I've done the -newca bit.
2006-06-16T12:22:00.000Z	Spec	ScatterBrain	k', if you need help following the commands i gave you send me a PM and i'll tell them to you in order :p
