2009-04-18T18:16:00.000Z	Noqq		musikgoat|eee:: I'm not really that kind of computer user. I don't know how to partipate free space.
2009-04-18T18:16:00.000Z	Noqq		So I got redirected to Wubi.
2009-04-18T18:16:00.000Z	Noqq		Ye that, sorry.
2009-04-18T18:17:00.000Z	Noqq		Right now, I'm installing Ubuntu (With Wubi) on my Netbook, installing at C:\
2009-04-18T18:17:00.000Z	Noqq		If the method I'm doing right now, won't work, I will check out Unetbootin.
2009-04-18T18:18:00.000Z	Noqq		Ok
2009-04-18T18:18:00.000Z	Noqq		Howeve, I just installed Ubuntu at D:\, but I didn't got the Dual Boot screen. It went in XP right away. =\
2009-04-18T18:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	chagne your boot drive in the bios for the one with ubuntu on it
2009-04-18T18:19:00.000Z	Noqq	Pelo	Yes, I think it was that, like I said, I'm not that into pc's yet, so I forgot about that one. However, Ithink it will work now, Cause it's now installing to C:\
2009-04-18T18:20:00.000Z	Noqq		Will it not affect Windows main folder? Cause that one is also in C:\
2009-04-18T18:20:00.000Z	Noqq		That's the only thing I'm abit scared of. Although you hear Wubi is a good program that doesn't affect other programs.
2009-04-18T18:20:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	assuming you made a new partition on your c drive to put ubuntu on , no it should not affect windows
2009-04-18T18:21:00.000Z	Noqq		Ye, I choose in Wubi Installer, that it needs to get unpack to C:\ using 10gb.
2009-04-18T18:21:00.000Z	Noqq		Is that good?
2009-04-18T18:21:00.000Z	Noqq		Or do I need to do something else with partitioning my C:\ boot?
2009-04-18T18:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	I'm not all that familiar with wubi, it's not like a real ubuntu install, but it will not affect your windows , it's kind of like a trial install
2009-04-18T18:23:00.000Z	Noqq	Pelo	Ow, that kinda dissapointments me to hear. Ow well, If it works, I'll work with Wubi's Ubuntu for some days, than in the meantime I'll try getting the bootable USB.
2009-04-18T18:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	if you already installed, ubuntu on your d drive , not using wubi, you already have a full ubuntu instalation,  you just need to boot the d drive when you want to use ubuntu
2009-04-18T18:25:00.000Z	Noqq	Pelo	And thats in the BIOS? That was sometihng with.. pressing F8 at start?
2009-04-18T18:25:00.000Z	Noqq	Pelo	I prefered the Dual Boot, like it was explained in the tutorial I followed hough.
2009-04-18T18:26:00.000Z	Noqq		Yes, but snce it didn't worked when I installed it to D:\. (Windows is on C:\)
2009-04-18T18:26:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	on some computer,  pressing f8 will give you a boot drive selection,  (pressing f8 a boot),  on others you need to hit del or another key and get in the setup screen for your computer ( also at boot) and change it manualy there,
2009-04-18T18:26:00.000Z	Noqq	Pelo	But when I choose D:\ as boot, I still won't get Dual Boot, right? Then I need to hit F8 lateron if I want Windows.
2009-04-18T18:26:00.000Z	Pelo	Noqq	 assuming grub is configured correctly, you can just boot from the ubuntu drive and the ubuntu boot menu , should have noticed the windows installation on your computer and added it to the list of bootable OS
