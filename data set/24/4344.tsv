2007-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	hikyuu_	sanityx	yes
2007-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	hikyuu_	sanityx	it even has a GDDB for it
2007-05-02T13:55:00.000Z	hikyuu_	sanityx	its just something to do with my X.org configuration, since SL complains about it too
2007-05-02T13:55:00.000Z	hikyuu_	sanityx	apparently, even tho i set it to 24bit, i still cant achieve 32bit

2007-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	sanityx	hikyuu_	Huh? Why can't you search for bands.
2007-05-02T14:04:00.000Z	sanityx	hikyuu_	Just browse the music torrents sections
