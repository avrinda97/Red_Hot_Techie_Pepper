2009-02-26T02:03:00.000Z	Poundo		is there an rpm or deb on it how do I find out
2009-02-26T02:03:00.000Z	Poundo		ok what then
2009-02-26T02:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	is EMACs not good for you?
2009-02-26T02:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	anyways:   sudo apt-get install bluefish
2009-02-26T02:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	always search the repos first
2009-02-26T02:05:00.000Z	Poundo	Titan8990	apt-get not on the machine
2009-02-26T02:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	are you not running ubuntu? this is the ubuntu support room
2009-02-26T02:06:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	im guessing you didn't install this os?
2009-02-26T02:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	alright, so let me get this straight, you have an OS, but you don't know what it is
2009-02-26T02:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	you want a program, but you don't know what package manager it uses
2009-02-26T02:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	are you being serious?
2009-02-26T02:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	all linux is GNU/Linux....
2009-02-26T02:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	so now we have narrowed it down to around 100 distros
2009-02-26T02:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	where did you get this computer?
2009-02-26T02:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	with the given information, the best I can do is recommend you manually compile the source code
2009-02-26T02:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	which package manager are you using?
2009-02-26T02:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	nvm, I thought you were saying you figured out the package manager....
2009-02-26T02:13:00.000Z	Poundo	Titan8990	Thats the question which package manager can i use on RPM shows up but some one said that was a bad idea
2009-02-26T02:14:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	its dependant on your distro
2009-02-26T02:15:00.000Z	Poundo	Titan8990	round and round. How do i find out what the distro is?
2009-02-26T02:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	debian, ubuntu and derivitives use aptitude,  suse and derivitives use yast,  rhel and dervitives use yum,  and gentoo, bsd and dervities use portage and pkg
2009-02-26T02:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	ask the person that installed it
2009-02-26T02:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	Poundo	sometimes uname -r will do it, not always
