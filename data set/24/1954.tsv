2009-06-09T07:24:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	do not use the x-org driver with the 4850 it did bad things to my computer :)
2009-06-09T07:24:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	which should I use instead then?
2009-06-09T07:25:00.000Z	Guthur		xcp like others said, use the ones from ATI website
2009-06-09T07:25:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	oh... by xorg driver you mean the one that comes with ubuntu?
2009-06-09T07:25:00.000Z	Guthur		xcp ya sorry maybe i missed something
2009-06-09T07:26:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	when you used the Ubuntu driver, have you had any problems with xorg memory usage?
2009-06-09T07:26:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	i had problems getting ubuntu to boot again, i had video corruption and couldn't get into the OS at all, had to reinstall in the end
2009-06-09T07:26:00.000Z	XCP		oh
2009-06-09T07:26:00.000Z	XCP		sorry to hear that
2009-06-09T07:27:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	nah it wasn't that bad i had only installed it anyway, no lose or anything, just a bit of a waste of time :)
2009-06-09T07:27:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	but the official ATI driver works fine
2009-06-09T07:28:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	glad to hear that... I just downloaded it and ran the .run file... do I have to do anything else after that or does the .run file everything for me?
2009-06-09T07:29:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	i think thats all i did, just ran it with sudo, and it was good to go :)
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	wish me luck, I gonna restart now :)
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	I'm running x64 though, which might have been my initial problem
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	XCP		me too, Guthur
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	well then definitely stick with the official, hope it works as well for you :)
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	XCP		thanks :)
2009-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	XCP		bbl
2009-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	XCP	Guthur	restart succeeded, how can I test if the driver is actually active?
2009-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	you can go to terminal and type - aticonfig --list-adapters
2009-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	ignore that first  -  its confusing, just ~$ aticonfig --list-adapters
2009-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	for a list of tweaking functions enter ~$ aticonfig
2009-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	Guthur	XCP	you can also go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
