2011-05-31T04:25:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Yup
2011-05-31T04:25:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Unless he is willing to mount more.
2011-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	users-admin appears to be a GUI app - gksu is more appropriate
2011-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Yes, just realised, silly idea to have it in gui.
2011-05-31T05:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	just FYI (not related to present support) starting users-admin as a member of admin (sudo) vs starting with "gksu users-admin" resulted in slightly different results on my system
2011-05-31T05:13:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	gksu users-admin just froze on my system, you would want to inspect launche (drag item from menu to desktop and right-click))
2011-05-31T05:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	i don't really see a use for users-admin
2011-06-02T02:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	thanks
2011-06-02T02:41:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	hm, I think he can just export PATH, or source .bashrc
2011-06-02T02:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	true!
2011-06-21T05:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	i386 is i686 from an Ubuntu perspective
2011-06-21T05:49:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	ok, Is there tool retty-like for 64bit server?
2011-06-21T05:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	no idea.
2011-06-21T05:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	couldn't you accomplish the same thing with screen?  I'm not entirely clear what retty does...
2011-06-21T05:53:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Like an idiot, started crawler out of screen (well tmux), but there is tool called gbd
2011-06-21T05:54:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Sorry, gdb
2011-06-21T05:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	GNU Debugger?
2011-06-21T05:55:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	yes, how to: http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/02/27/redirecting-output-from-a-running-process/
2011-07-07T03:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	"You need also vesa driver to use mplayer in tty" or just "..-vo aa.." ;)
2011-07-07T03:54:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	hehe
2011-07-07T03:55:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	Usually I watch Matrix this way....
2011-07-07T03:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	makes it more accurate eh?  ;)
2011-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	qin	ZykoticK9	So, you are hardliner, comrade.
2011-07-07T08:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	qin	i guess?  I even use "gnu/linux" whenever i can ;)
