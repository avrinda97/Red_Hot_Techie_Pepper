2011-11-23T14:28:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	You too, you too.
2011-11-23T14:18:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Ugh... everything crashed.
2011-11-23T14:19:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	I was going to, but I was in the process of disabling and enabling according to that list.
2011-11-23T14:19:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	I told you to do that while metacity was running
2011-11-23T14:19:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	What??
2011-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Ugh.
2011-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	You said it long after I had already been looking at the compiz-settings-manager
2011-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	anyway, when compiz crashes you can just go to tty and run 'DISPLAY=:0 metacity --replace'
2011-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Okay. But when things crashed before, I lost the list of things you'd been saying.
2011-11-23T14:21:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	That means your IRC cleint sucks ;)
2011-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	So what plugins + how can I set metacity as a fallback?
2011-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	Do yourself a favor and use a real client like xchat instead of the web interface
2011-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	I hardly know how to use irc, honestly. I use webchat.freenode.net
2011-11-23T14:23:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	When my boyfriend is back for Winter break, it's the first thing I'll ask him, i promise.
2011-11-23T14:23:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Okay
2011-11-23T14:24:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Fair enough. You've been more than patient.
2011-11-23T14:24:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	Ask him what? xchat is easy to install..
2011-11-23T14:25:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	How to use IRC. It baffles me. I have an easier time playing with C than I do with this, and I have zero background in programming.
2011-11-23T14:26:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	xchat is very easy to use. just apt-get install it and ubuntu channel is the default I believe
2011-11-23T14:26:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Anyway, I really appreciate all your help, honest. But I have to call it a night. I've been sick for like three days, I'll try what you said in full later and hope it goes well, otherwise I'll pop into the forums.
2011-11-23T14:27:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Thanks so much
2011-11-23T14:27:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	pop into #compiz, it's easier to chat there
2011-11-23T14:28:00.000Z	sln45_	soreau	Oh, perfect. That's exactly what I'll do. Gosh, I really should have done that in the first place
2011-11-23T14:28:00.000Z	soreau	sln45_	have a good night, I'm out too
