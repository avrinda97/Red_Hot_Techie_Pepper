2008-03-09T02:26:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle		Hey all, I'm back.  i was wondering if anyone has experience with making it so that I don't need to sudo all the fricking time.  Can I change my user account access level to root?
2008-03-09T02:26:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle		OK, why shouldn't I?
2008-03-09T02:27:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	If you need a root shell you can use 'sudo -s'
2008-03-09T02:27:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 That's all I was looking for.  Thanks!
2008-03-09T11:23:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	I don't think anyone has gotten around the DRM on those, but I could be wrong
2008-03-09T11:24:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	look here:  http://tinyurl.com/24wzet
2008-03-09T11:24:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 That page is valid, assuming that you're using the default bash shell that's included with ubuntu.
2008-03-09T11:25:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	I don't mean launching things from the shell - I'm talking about for applications launched from the gnome-panel for example
2008-03-09T11:26:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	Unless those are supposed to check .bash_profile too?
2008-03-09T11:26:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 Sorry, I miss-understood what you were trying to do.  Would it be possible for you to clarify?
2008-03-09T11:28:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	Sure - I've installed a kde program from source into /usr/local. It has some plugins which reside in /usr/local/lib/kde3, but when I launch the program KDE doesn't know to look there.
2008-03-09T11:28:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	I need to set $KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr
2008-03-09T11:29:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 lol.  I wish that I had enough experience to answer that question.  I'm sorry.
2008-03-09T11:29:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	no problem, I think did answer it actually :) I put it in my .bashrc, but not .profile. I think it's working now
2008-03-09T11:29:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	(with it in .profile that is)
2008-03-09T11:31:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	Ack, it didn't do it :/ Right now I'm launching it from a script to set the variable but I don't want to run into this problem again
2008-03-09T11:32:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 I'm using mostly commandline and icewm for my x windows experience.
2008-03-09T11:32:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	Well, first I doubt they'd convert to mp3 since they developed their AAC format and it fuels their iPod sales
2008-03-09T11:33:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	I hear you, my file manager is a sticky terminal :)
2008-03-09T11:34:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 (on the subject of music w/ drm) If I purchased the music legally, I should have the right to do with it what I wish.... right?
2008-03-09T11:35:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	Of course, but that's not how the record companies think
2008-03-09T11:36:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 So I just start buying non-drm stuff, and forget about all that music that's got the drm?
2008-03-09T11:39:00.000Z	farruinn	SeanInSeattle	I guess, or buy the CDs and rip them to a non-drm'd format.
2008-03-09T11:39:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	farruinn	 Funny, I think its been more than ten years since I bought a CD.
