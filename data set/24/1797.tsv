2009-08-19T21:36:00.000Z	urthmover		hmm sound works in Skype and at the login prompt but nowhere else....what can I do to resole this?
2009-08-19T21:37:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	what kind of problem are experiencing?...
2009-08-19T21:38:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	I do not hear sound from many apps.  I do hear sound when I login and on Skype.  but not in vlc or when I use preferences > sound > test button
2009-08-19T21:38:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	you mean with music you've got problems right?..
2009-08-19T21:39:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	music or videos or ubuntu sound events
2009-08-19T21:40:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	if I can get the System > Preferences > Sound Preferences ... test buttons and such to work  I think that will solve my problems.
2009-08-19T21:40:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	is it codecs problem?.. or you can't hear nothing at all...
2009-08-19T21:41:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	I hear nothing when I press the Test buttons ..(any of them) on my Sound Preferences
2009-08-19T21:41:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	go to: system -> preferencies -> sound preferencies
2009-08-19T21:41:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	try to use different modules...
2009-08-19T21:42:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	for example: use ALSA, then try with OSS, switch different modules and le me know if something works..
2009-08-19T21:43:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	ok OSS ones work.  is that going to be a problem that ALSA or autodetect does not work?
2009-08-19T21:43:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	yes, exactly.. :-)
2009-08-19T21:43:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	use OSS and relax.. :-D
2009-08-19T21:44:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	ok thanks for your help
2009-08-19T21:44:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	you're welcome... ;-)
2009-08-19T21:45:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	ugg still no sound in vlc .... or xbmc  I guess I have to go manually configure them to use OSS now too?
2009-08-19T21:46:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	vlc somewhere there should have option to change default module...
2009-08-19T21:46:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	switch it use OSS instead of ALSA..
2009-08-19T21:47:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	there is  I've got vlc working using OSS .... now I'm digging around in XBMC.....I wonder what has happened that Auto (in sound preferences has stopped working)
2009-08-19T21:47:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	there could be lots of problems...
2009-08-19T21:48:00.000Z	urthmover	miko1	thanks for giving me something to work with
2009-08-19T21:48:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	you're welcome, always glad to be helpful... :-)
2009-08-19T21:49:00.000Z	miko1	urthmover	sorry, i have to go now....
