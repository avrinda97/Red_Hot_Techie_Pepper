2011-08-18T03:19:00.000Z	daavis_		so, the question is what is the name of login screen which goes there by default ?

2011-08-18T03:21:00.000Z	daavis_		nvidia
2011-08-18T03:22:00.000Z	daavis_		installation of driver ruined it

2011-08-18T03:25:00.000Z	daavis_		ok, i will
2011-08-18T03:26:00.000Z	daavis_		glxinfo is not installed
2011-08-18T03:26:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	   sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
2011-08-18T03:27:00.000Z	daavis_	coz_	 done
2011-08-18T03:28:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	  now you should be able to run glxinfo
2011-08-18T03:29:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 dual video chipsets?
2011-08-18T03:29:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 I didnt see the output of  this command ,,,    lspci | grep -i vga
2011-08-18T03:30:00.000Z	daavis_	coz_	here?
2011-08-18T03:30:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 yes
2011-08-18T03:31:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 then Gentoo64   was correct,, you most likely will not be able to run the nvidia driver with that configuration,, I have seen strange things happen when both drivers where installed includkng  a complete upside down and reversed , but fully funtional desktop
2011-08-18T03:37:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 you already uninstalled nvidia driver?
2011-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	daavis_	coz_	yea
2011-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 through jockey-gtk...yes?
2011-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 right that would have bee jockey-gtk
2011-08-18T03:39:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 and you rebooted afterwards...yes?
2011-08-18T03:39:00.000Z	coz_	daavis_	 then the nvidia driver is still  active until reboot
