2006-06-08T07:09:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	I am truly a newbie in linux world and I just got fglrx work with my Radeon 850XT, only problem is I can't get 1280x960 resolution
2006-06-08T07:12:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	what have you done so far ?
2006-06-08T07:12:00.000Z	chamo	Hawkins	I have tried most of the steps found on the net.
2006-06-08T07:14:00.000Z	chamo	Hawkins	I have all the repo well configured. I had XGL working well. I have updated kernel (to 2.6.15-23-686) and I have reinstalled xorg-driver-fglrx + linux-restricted-modules-XXXXXX coreseponding.... And my xorg.conf has the line "Driver "fglrx" in it.
2006-06-08T07:14:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	I had to add fglrx into modules file which is loaded at boot
2006-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	I don't remember where it was located, but I'm searhing it at the moment
2006-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	you're right
2006-06-08T07:16:00.000Z	chamo	Hawkins	any other idea ?
2006-06-08T07:16:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	sudo gedit /etc/modules
2006-06-08T07:17:00.000Z	chamo	Hawkins	fglrx is in the modules to load file
2006-06-08T07:18:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	hmm... I didn't have it there first... I think just a plain booting system might help
2006-06-08T07:18:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	at least it made my driver work, if not, we should check your xorg.conf... or ask somebody who has been using linux more than one day :)
2006-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	roger, I'll put it there. I installed Dapper 32bit just recently and then installed fglrx
2006-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	and dou213 here's my xorg.conf at the moment http://pastebin.com/767290
2006-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	Hawkins	chamo	I have no idea about those, I can only help a bit with ATI + fglrx stuff
