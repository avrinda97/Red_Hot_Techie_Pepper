2006-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	anymo		can somebody explain me is the linux-image the kernel, I mean the kernel itself?
2006-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	anymo		I have installed three packages of linux-image
2006-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	anymo		so does that mean I have three kernels installed?
2006-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	anymo		sorry if it's stupid question but I'm not sure so I'm asking...
2006-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	it's quite possible
2006-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	so what is kernel-image?
2006-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	I've been upgrading ubuntu so I got new kernel
2006-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	it's the kernel
2006-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	so the kernel image is the very kernel itself... and what about other things?
2006-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	older versions of the kernel aren't removed (unless you do it explicitly) to allow you to go back to an older one if the new one has problems
2006-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	so what else is considered to be kernel...
2006-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	where are other dirs or kernel-image is kernel and other things are not directly connected to kernel?
2006-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	basically what do I get by downloading kernel sources for example.. if you could put it that way please ...
2006-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	kernel sources are needed if you are going to be compiling custom modules etc
2006-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	but are kernel modules strictly related to kernel version or they're independent and kernel-image is what the very kernel is all about?
2006-04-18T13:58:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	I was googling about this stuff and as far as I understud it's that way... kernel-image is the kernel and modules are used with kernel...
2006-04-18T13:58:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	that's correct
2006-04-18T13:59:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	so, now when I'm sure that this latest kernel works it's okay to remove kernel-images I supose, is there anything else I shoud remove or other things are not kernel specific version related?
2006-04-18T13:59:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	use synaptic to remove old images, don't just delete the files
2006-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	yes I ment through synaptic, but that's all I need to remove, there are no other specific kernel version related things?
2006-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	I just want to learn about this stuff since I haven't studied it before :)
2006-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	sorry for bothering you, but I didn't really understand this stuff so I didn't want to mess up the system...
2006-04-18T14:02:00.000Z	anymo	polpak	thanks very much for explaining this to me.. I think I got it now :)
2006-04-18T14:03:00.000Z	polpak	anymo	sure, no problem
