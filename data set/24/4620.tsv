2007-02-23T09:52:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	I've just googled for lararus and its a family tree app - what type of app is this

2007-02-23T09:53:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	what type of applicationis it
2007-02-23T09:53:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	I can find out the details on the apckage to see if its compattible
2007-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	one moment
2007-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	there are many ubuntu version
2007-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	I know - I want to see if its compatible with 6.10
2007-02-23T09:56:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	you can give it ago - there is little information on that package but it "looks" like its built against debian not ubuntu
2007-02-23T09:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	as I said - you can try it - but it does look like its built against debian
2007-02-23T09:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	where is the file
2007-02-23T09:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	move it to somewhere like your home dir or /
2007-02-23T09:59:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	reading some notes - you may have issues with some gtk updates on edgy 6.10 with that deb
2007-02-23T09:59:00.000Z	ikonia_	jernej	doesn't look anything major though
