2010-12-15T19:39:00.000Z	seul		nothingalspecial: ok. I want to use SCSI3 and #3 with the status primary. But when i click enter, it just says that the partition if formatted with ntfs and i get some options
2010-12-15T19:40:00.000Z	rigved	seul	you must have formatted the partition earlier when installing windows. just format it if you are sure that it is not the windows partition
2010-12-15T19:41:00.000Z	seul	rigved	what do you mean? It is formatted from windtows to NTFS. Doenst that work?
2010-12-15T19:42:00.000Z	rigved	seul	yes it does. delete it and format it as ext4
2010-12-15T19:42:00.000Z	rigved	seul	are you sure it's not the windows one?
2010-12-15T19:43:00.000Z	seul	rigved	yes i am very sure :) so now it says pri/log and that is free space. Should i just click enter now?
2010-12-15T19:44:00.000Z	rigved	seul	yes. format it as ext4, set as bootable and mount point as /
2010-12-15T19:44:00.000Z	rigved	seul	also you need one more partition as swap
2010-12-15T19:45:00.000Z	seul	rigved	should i use Primare or logical? Got those two options
2010-12-15T19:45:00.000Z	rigved	seul	primary
2010-12-15T19:45:00.000Z	rigved	seul	primary for swap also
2010-12-15T19:46:00.000Z	seul	rigved	ok. Now should i choose "done setting up the partition? Or what?
2010-12-15T19:46:00.000Z	rigved	seul	yes
2010-12-15T19:46:00.000Z	rigved	seul	did you set it as bootable and the mount point as /
2010-12-15T19:47:00.000Z	seul	rigved	i didnt really get to choose. Says mount options are defaults, and bootable flag is off..
2010-12-15T19:47:00.000Z	rigved	seul	select the partition again
2010-12-15T19:48:00.000Z	rigved	seul	the select the mount point
2010-12-15T19:48:00.000Z	rigved	seul	set it as /
2010-12-15T19:49:00.000Z	seul	rigved	it already was set as such.
2010-12-15T19:49:00.000Z	rigved	seul	ok. now set it as bootable
2010-12-15T19:50:00.000Z	seul	rigved	How?! Because when i click bootable flag it just loads for a second and then it just says "off" still.
2010-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	rigved	seul	you should be able to set the partition as bootable
2010-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	seul	rigved	fuck this alternate version.. I'm so close to just download the normal version again.. The reason i took this one is because the normal one was so slow. This is now worth it.
2010-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	rigved	seul	ok
