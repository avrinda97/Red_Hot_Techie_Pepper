2009-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		well, I'm old school Unix person.. but I haven't touched it in over 10 years
2009-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		it's interesting
2009-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		I like the idea of open source and FREE
2009-05-25T11:24:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		maybe you can give me some hints on how to activate the desktop enhancements in Gnome?
2009-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		I have onboard graphics
2009-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	iceroot	BeatlesFan	you mean compiz?
2009-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		compiz
2009-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		yes
2009-05-25T11:25:00.000Z	iceroot	BeatlesFan	systems-settings-appereance (i think is the english translation)
2009-05-25T11:26:00.000Z	BeatlesFan	iceroot	right, but when I change it to Normal or Enhanced, it says can not enable
2009-05-25T11:26:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		and the only option is to click "ok"
2009-05-25T11:26:00.000Z	iceroot	BeatlesFan	which onboard card?
2009-05-25T11:27:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		hang on, let me check, I used to know

2009-05-25T11:27:00.000Z	iceroot	BeatlesFan	its ok to know if it is intel, nvidia or ati
2009-05-25T11:27:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		it's intel
2009-05-25T11:27:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		I know that for sure
2009-05-25T11:28:00.000Z	iceroot	BeatlesFan	hm then 3d should work out of the box with the open source driver
2009-05-25T11:30:00.000Z	BeatlesFan		irceroot, not sure, how do I check?
