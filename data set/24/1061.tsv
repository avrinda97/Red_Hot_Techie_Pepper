2010-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		<robyromania> hi, can you recommend me the best video player/codec in ubuntu to play HD content? <--- maybe mplayer can partially handle BD but i don`t recall having read about BD protection being cracked
2010-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		<robyromania> <Fate_Testarossa> what do you mean my BD? <--- didn`t you ask about blu-ray?
2010-08-08T13:56:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		!stab abhijit
2010-08-08T13:56:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		what, no stabbing service?
2010-08-08T13:58:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		why are you !tab`ing others?
2010-08-08T13:59:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		what if want to copy the line i`m responding to?
2010-08-08T13:59:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		you don`t expect me to retype it, do you?
2010-08-08T14:00:00.000Z	robyromania	Fate_Testarossa	so what's the best codec for decoding mkv in mplayer? i have a 3 ghz pentium 4
2010-08-08T14:00:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		mkv is a container
2010-08-08T14:00:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		codecs are different thing
2010-08-08T14:01:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		but i reckon you`ve got AVC (also called H.264 among other names) there
2010-08-08T14:01:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		which means you want ffh264 (FFmpeg H.264 implementation)
2010-08-08T14:01:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		if it`s available, mplayer will use it
2010-08-08T14:02:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		btw, it`s compiled in mplayer
2010-08-08T14:02:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		at least usually
2010-08-08T14:02:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		no idea about precompiled mplayer builds in ubuntu as i build it myself
2010-08-08T14:02:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		oh
2010-08-08T14:02:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		right
2010-08-08T14:03:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa	robyromania	you could try vlc for starters
2010-08-08T14:04:00.000Z	robyromania	Fate_Testarossa	ok, thanks. i'm not really a starter, there's just a lot of codecs and it takes me too much time to test them all, with all the options. i thought, maybe i find someone experienced in HD vide decoding
2010-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa	robyromania	oh you meant that by hd
2010-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		:D
2010-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	Fate_Testarossa		vlc is pretty bad
2010-08-08T14:06:00.000Z	robyromania	Fate_Testarossa	yeah, i meant high definiton. like 720p and 1080p
