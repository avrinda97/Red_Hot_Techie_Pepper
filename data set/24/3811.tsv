2007-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	hitomaro		thanks anyways
2007-10-06T07:54:00.000Z	hitomaro		I'm having a problem getting into ubuntu
2007-10-06T07:54:00.000Z	hitomaro		x-server error
2007-10-06T07:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	but you can get to the terminal prompt?
2007-10-06T07:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	type the following into a terminal.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-10-06T07:58:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	thats it?
2007-10-06T07:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	that will reconfigure your X which is the gui.. if you have issues that's where you start.
2007-10-06T07:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	after running through the prompts and it finishes, type... startx
2007-10-06T10:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	were we talking earlier about getting your gui running?  Did it work?
2007-10-06T10:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	good..
2007-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	should I just buy a new motherboard?
2007-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	why?
2007-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	I've been away for a while
2007-10-06T10:36:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	I've been having compatibility issues with ubuntu on this pc, my pc downstairs works smoothly but with this is nothing but headacke
2007-10-06T10:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	what's happening.
2007-10-06T10:38:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	It's just my video card and my onboard not listening to one another I presume when it comes to ubuntu, I bought a new graphics card because of this very reason but it's still the same problem, my conclusion is that it has to be my motherboard thats causing all this mess
2007-10-06T10:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	are you trying to use two monitors? one on the onboard graphics card and the other on .. the other.?
2007-10-06T10:40:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	I'm using one single monitor at the moment
2007-10-06T10:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	you may have to manually tweek /etc/X11/xorg.conf to get the other card working.  First you'll have to identify it's location, as in buss id and use that. I'm not sure how to do that actually..maybe with "lspci"
2007-10-06T10:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	then change the driver to nv if it's set to vesa or i810 or intel.  Then install nvidia driver from synaptic.
2007-10-06T10:48:00.000Z	hitomaro	Scunizi	ok I'll try that
2007-10-06T10:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	warning.. messing with xorg.conf can drive you nuts and render the gui inop. make a backup before tweeking.
2007-10-06T10:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	hitomaro	also changes won't take effect until you ctrl-alt-backspace.  if the gui doesn't work ctrl+f2 to get to a terminal prompt to fix it then startx to start it and ctrl+f7 to get to the gui screen
