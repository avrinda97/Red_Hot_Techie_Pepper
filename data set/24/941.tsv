2012-05-08T14:19:00.000Z	miscni		just curious, does others also have trouble with, to install teamviewer on Ubuntu 12.04???
2012-05-08T14:19:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	it installed fine for me
2012-05-08T14:19:00.000Z	miscni	KM0201	I get a weird message, about it is not possibul to remove Essencial data
2012-05-08T14:20:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	are you using a recently downloaded package?.. or is this an old package you downloaded ?.. there were some changes to the way ubuntu does things, and teamviewer released a new package to adapt to that
2012-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	miscni		just got the new one downloaded from Teamviewer
2012-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	miscni	KM0201	just got the new one downloaded from Teamviewer
2012-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	i assume you're using 64bit?
2012-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	miscni	KM0201	actaully no, I am using 32
2012-05-08T14:21:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	now that i'm not sure, i've always heard this problem affecting 64bit users
2012-05-08T14:22:00.000Z	miscni	KM0201	yeah that I have noticed on the forums... maybe it is just a error 39Â½ from my side, I will try something... 2 sec

2012-05-08T14:25:00.000Z	miscni	KM0201	just downloaded the 64-bit version, and that is installed correctly, but my system is 32-bit, there is something that doesn't make sense
2012-05-08T14:25:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	yeah, something doesn't make sense there

2012-05-08T14:27:00.000Z	KM0201	miscni	well, it may not, but.. that's what you're using
