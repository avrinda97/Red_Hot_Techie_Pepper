2005-03-03T12:33:00.000Z	kreiger		anybody know what folder i have to add gnome window borders to?
2005-03-03T12:35:00.000Z	kreiger		how does one switch the default window manager?
2005-03-03T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	use the configuration editor
2005-03-03T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	xfwm4 works well as a window manager with gnome, but there's a less-than-trivial race condition with the session manager
2005-03-03T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	between gnome-session->gnome-settings-daemon and xfce4-mcs-manager
2005-03-03T12:44:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	gnome-session starts a program that conflicts with one that xfwm4 depends on
2005-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	no, they won't crash. one of them will just spit out error messages.
2005-03-03T12:50:00.000Z	kreiger	crimsun	on a constant basis?
2005-03-03T12:51:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	no; it's a race condition, and it's not pinnable.
2005-03-03T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	sudo aptitude purge something
2005-03-03T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	or purge the dependency
2005-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	3.8? warty includes 4.0.5
2005-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	I don't know - why did you want to?
2005-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	it's highly recommended that you _do_ apt-get it
2005-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	or use a package manager to install the version in 'universe'
2005-03-03T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	that's a metapackage
2005-03-03T13:19:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	not necessary, just install 'xfce4'
2005-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	eh? No need to "install it" if you've installed 'xfce4'.
2005-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	just log in choosing the "XFce session" in the graphical log in (under Session)
2005-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	false.
2005-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	kreiger	crimsun	you got one too?
2005-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	no, my roommate, who was online earlier, has one
2005-03-24T08:42:00.000Z	crimsun	kreiger	3"
