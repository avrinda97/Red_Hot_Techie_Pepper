2007-10-07T06:23:00.000Z	JamoSmith		how do I allow ppl to connect to my ubuntu machine without me first logging into it. ie) when they connect they must start their own session
2007-10-07T06:24:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	through what protocol?
2007-10-07T06:24:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	vnc?
2007-10-07T06:26:00.000Z	JamoSmith	usser	I just explored 'Remote Desktop' from the preferences and it seems that's only sharing the desktop opposed to letting users have their own
2007-10-07T06:26:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	oh that actually there are a lot of options )
2007-10-07T06:27:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	hang on i look up a faq, ive never done it myself
2007-10-07T06:27:00.000Z	JamoSmith	usser	thank you
2007-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	JamoSmith	usser	did you find anything?
2007-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	cant find it
2007-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	JamoSmith	usser	so you're saying that you believe I shoudl be enable Remote Desktop beyond the scope of a single existing session
2007-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	no not that
2007-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	usser	JamoSmith	there should be something like xdmcp server
2007-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	JamoSmith	usser	can you say whether or not this process would be complicated for a noob or not? if so, I'll just use the remote desktop and call it a good day for now
