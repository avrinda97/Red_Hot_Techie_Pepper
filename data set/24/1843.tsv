2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	infid		i haved 6gb of ram and yet everytime i start upfirefox it takes like 10 seconds before that spinning loading icon thing stops. What's up with that?
2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	infid		i dont even have any plugins installed in it
2010-01-15T03:19:00.000Z	infid		and only one tab
2010-01-15T03:20:00.000Z	infid		firefox doesnt seem to do this on my netbook
2010-01-15T03:21:00.000Z	infid		can it hurt my battery to have my powersupply plugged into my Eeepc 24/7. ie can it overcharge the battery?
2010-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	no not overcharged but memory-effect because its using the battery not the powersupply directly
2010-01-15T03:22:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	remove the batterie if you dont need it
2010-01-15T03:23:00.000Z	infid	iceroot	well i still unplug it and just go off the battery a few hours a day
2010-01-15T03:23:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	ok
2010-01-16T02:31:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	dash is the default shell on ubuntu, debian is still using bash but squeeze will change to dash too
2010-01-16T02:32:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	ubuntu is using dash
2010-01-16T02:44:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	lm-sensors
2010-01-16T02:51:00.000Z	infid	iceroot	i ran sensor-detect and it sayd 'required module f8000 is not currently installed' how do i install it?
2010-01-30T13:27:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	LTS
2010-04-25T01:46:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	because http:// is missing?
2010-07-02T22:23:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	sudo apt-get install slapd
2010-07-02T22:23:00.000Z	infid	iceroot	i mean an existing one that i dont have to set up
2010-07-02T22:23:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	cant imaging someone is giving you write-access to slapd
2010-07-02T22:24:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	#slapd
2010-07-02T22:25:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	#ldap
2010-07-02T22:27:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	depending what you want, search, modify, dump
2010-07-02T22:27:00.000Z	iceroot	infid	ldapsearch -x uid=foobar
