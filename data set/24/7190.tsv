2005-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		or does it install everything on the cd at once?
2005-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		i mean like packages :P
2005-03-29T08:01:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		oh, so its too much of a hassle to do i guess?
2005-03-29T08:02:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		whoa, thenuke you use ubuntu? :P
2005-03-29T08:02:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		ah... so it would be expert on boot
2005-03-29T08:03:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		cause, i dont have much space left, after partitioning
2005-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		2gb

2005-03-29T08:05:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^		and also what i think is weird... is that ubuntu is giving out free cds?!
2005-03-29T08:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	not weird, clever - the user base is buiding fast
2005-03-29T08:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	the idea is to order a few and give them to friends
2005-03-29T08:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	probably not
2005-03-29T08:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	the problem is specific to rar - unrar
2005-03-29T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	probably because it's gtk 1.2 and looks kind of odd (nice file manager though)
2005-03-29T08:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	ah Ok - didn't know that - thanks
2005-03-29T12:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	the amn himself I believe - mark Shuttleworth
2005-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	he's the guy with the money and the founder, yes

2005-04-12T15:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	ssh IP.of.box  or ssh nameofbox
2005-04-12T15:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	telnet is evil

2005-08-10T05:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	^thehatsrule^	I think he's a bit preoccupied right now ;)
