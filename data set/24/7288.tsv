2005-04-25T08:42:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	are you trying to figure out how to dump a partition from one to the other ?
2005-04-25T08:42:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	correct
2005-04-25T08:42:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	and make it bootable
2005-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	oh ok, well I mirror my linux partition daily with rsync
2005-04-25T08:44:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	would you recommend partimage if i dont know what the hell im doing
2005-04-25T08:44:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	I've got no experience with it ... only rsync to prevent me screwing up my system..AGAIN
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	so rsync can copy my partition to a freespace one, directly?
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	if so, would you point me to a tutorial of how to do this, or maybe how you do it
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	as I said, I do a direct dump of my partition daily
2005-04-25T08:45:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	is the copy bootable?
2005-04-25T08:46:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	it's not bootable because I choose not to boot to it, you would need to install a boot loader to it's MBR but that's a piece of piss
2005-04-25T08:47:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	why cant i use grub and change the root fs
2005-04-25T08:47:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	my daily cron is sudo rsync -au --exclude "/media" --exclude "sys/" --exclude "proc/" / /media/downloads/Linux so it syncs everything except media, sys and proc ...and it backs it up to /media/downloads/Linux
2005-04-25T08:49:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	but where does it put the copy?
2005-04-25T08:50:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	so the only modifier i need is -a?
2005-04-25T08:51:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	-a does an archive of the files, so maintains all sym links and permissions
2005-04-25T08:51:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	i dont understand why an archive would keep symlinks/permissions
2005-04-25T08:52:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	do a man rsync to understand :)
2005-04-25T09:08:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	can i see your cron daily again?
2005-04-25T09:10:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	if you didnt exclude media, would it be caught in a loop?
2005-04-25T09:12:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	should i exclude sys and proc as well?
2005-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	assuming i want to make the copied files bootable at somepoint
2005-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	membreya	Coily	I exclude sys because it hangs my system..but im not 100% sure of it ...proc I exclude because it's virtual :)
2005-04-25T09:14:00.000Z	Coily	membreya	so an empty proc folder wouldnt stop ubuntu from booting?
