2011-03-07T10:36:00.000Z	j_ayen_green		something autoloaded the file system ... how can I 'unbusy' it so I can run fsck?
2011-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	j_ayen_green		what's the ubuntu equivalent of pmount?
2011-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	what is pmount?
2011-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	I was told to enter that to see if something had privately mounted the file system, since it is busy, but it's not a command
2011-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	it is a waper arround mount
2011-03-07T10:41:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	ah, ok. well, i have a catch 22.. fsck returns /dev/sda1 is busy or mounted. umount says not mounted. mount -t ext4 says nothing, but then still cannot umount
2011-03-07T10:41:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	type mount
2011-03-07T10:42:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	mount doesn't show it (or any ext4) mounted... just /dev/sr0 and dev/loop0 (running from an .iso as 'try' instead of 'install')
2011-03-07T10:43:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	did you ever mount it or place it in fstab?
2011-03-07T10:44:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	it had been mounted as my file system, then i had a hang. did the magic sysrq keys, and then every boot put me in grub. So i just booted from the livecd iso, selected "try ubuntu" rather than installing, and the file system shows in fdisk, but I cant get to it
2011-03-07T10:46:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	this seems to be where I'm at...at the beginning of this post http://www.uluga.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1682038
2011-03-07T10:46:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	I dont think ubuntu auto-mounts stuff that is not in fstab, it could be seeign that it dected it but did not mount it but shows up under places area
2011-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	the file system shows in the places pulldown...is that what's making it busy?
2011-03-07T10:48:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	no ieda
2011-03-07T10:55:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	do you want to keep dnome on system?
2011-03-07T10:55:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	yes, I just want to try to prevent it from autoloading that file system so I can run fsck
2011-03-07T10:57:00.000Z	shaghost	j_ayen_green	well i can tell you the simple way or complex =P   simple: break x-server (this i have done a _LOT_ on axadent
2011-03-07T10:58:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	so no keystroke to boot to cli or something? again, i'm booting from the .iso read-only, that said, how would I break X if that's the option?

2011-03-07T11:03:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	shaghost	yeah... i'm booting from a livecd to get at the old filesystem ... but gnome seems to have made it busy
