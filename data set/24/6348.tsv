2006-10-20T11:44:00.000Z	JaytheGreat		hey guys
2006-10-20T11:45:00.000Z	JaytheGreat		how do I set up 2 different hard drives (one with XP and one with ubuntu) ?
2006-10-20T11:46:00.000Z	JaytheGreat		lol y u ignore me?
2006-10-20T11:47:00.000Z	JaytheGreat		where do I type in !dualboot?
2006-10-20T11:47:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	nowhere. you have a private message from Ubotu
2006-10-20T11:54:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	you mean you can't boot from the Ubuntu Desktop CD?
2006-10-20T11:55:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	what set up? i'm not following you anymore... 1) do you have ubuntu installed but can't get to it, or you haven't managed to get it installed yet?  2) if you have ubuntu already installed, did you change your IDE setup and then ubuntu stopped working?
2006-10-20T11:56:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	then it probably just means that your BIOS is set up so that the XP hard drive has a chance to boot first
2006-10-20T11:57:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	try going into the BIOS and change the settings so that the *other* drive is the first boot drive
2006-10-20T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	anyway, if the drive that's at the "middle" connector of the cable is the Master, and the one that is at the "far" end of the cable is the Slave, that's a wrong setup (at least if you have a modern ATA cable). The Master should be at the "far" end of the cable, always
2006-10-20T11:59:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	that the Master drive (i.e. the "Windows XP" drive, where you said the jumpers are set to Master) appears to be attached at the middle connector of the cable.
2006-10-20T12:01:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	yes i know it is the IDE cable. i am saying that you've got the drives swapped. the master should be at the end of the cable, and the slave at the middle
2006-10-20T12:02:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	that depends on the particular drive i suppose, i don't know the pin configurations. most drives have schematics for the pins drawn on them. you could just set both drives to Cable Select
2006-10-20T12:03:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	yeah, but you probably have it already installed... just on the wrong drive, i'd suppose
2006-10-20T12:04:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	(by the way, the IDE cable should also have a color code: Blue goes to the motherboard, Black goes to the master, Gray goes to the slave)
2006-10-20T12:04:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	no, you can't install Grub from XP. you can install it by booting the Ubuntu CD. or, IMHO, you could just try going into the BIOS and changing your boot drive to the other drive, and see if that works
2006-10-20T12:06:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	if after doing what i said Grub works correctly, it should give you a choice for booting XP instead of Linux.
2006-10-20T12:07:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	I don't really know, it depends on what precisely the Ubuntu installer did, and how the drives were set up originally. I'd try with just the BIOS first -- although, if your drives are actually set incorrectly (i.e. Black is not the master and Gray is not the slave), you should still change that
2006-10-20T12:09:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	alright, then i suggest you just try changing the boot drive from the BIOS. if that fails, you can always change it back at least.
2006-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	so, Grub is loading, and it can start both XP and Linux, but the Linux fails starting, while XP works ok?
2006-10-20T12:21:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	ok, so to get back to XP you had to change the BIOS settings again?
2006-10-20T12:22:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	when you say "the ubuntu screen" you mean the graphical splash screen?
2006-10-20T12:24:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	well, then i think Grub is loading. i believed it should show a menu by default, but apparently it doesn't. anyway, if you press Esc at the right time during boot (i.e. after the BIOS gives way to the system, i.e. just keep pressing Esc like mad until you see a menu), you can change the Grub options. i suspect that your Grub is trying to set the wrong root device for Ubuntu. when you see the Grub menu, go to the entry for Ubuntu,
2006-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	LjL	JaytheGreat	there are many "black screens" that i can think of during a system's boot process... no, press Esc *before* the splash loads. basically, start pressing it at the BIOS screen, and press it a couple of times
