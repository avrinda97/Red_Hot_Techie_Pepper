2006-05-19T14:25:00.000Z	delmar		So.. Evolution blows chunks and crashes every 30mins for me... Thunderbird 1.0(whatever it was) messes up my email ... Thunderbird 1.5.2(or whatever it is) does the same thing...is there any decent mail package for linux/ubuntu that even bloody works?
2006-05-19T14:26:00.000Z	delmar		heh
2006-05-19T14:26:00.000Z	delmar		Firefox 1.08 is one of the few things that so far.. hasn't given me trouble at all
2006-05-19T14:28:00.000Z	delmar		This Dapper thing i hear about.. this is the next ubuntu version up? im running ubunty 5.10.. is it easy to upgrade/migrate or is it better to re-install from cd/dvd ? or should I not bother with Dapper? whats different?
2006-05-19T14:28:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	easy to upgrade
2006-05-19T14:28:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	whats different... just later packages?
2006-05-19T14:28:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	more like.. debian sid/unstable ?
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	be like going from sarge to sid ?
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	newer packages, more work done on making it user friendly, is faster, and will be supported for approximately eleventy billion years
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	ok so only 3 years of support, but that's a lifetime
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	yep. so i should upgrade?
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	when it goes stable, yeah
2006-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	i would recommend that :)
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	ive been playing with Debian "unstable" for years. prefer that because the packages are much newer
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	so if its like that.. i might as well gib that a go
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	heh, i hated unstable
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	when i ran debian, i was one of the few who actually ran stable
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	do u run Dapper now?
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	yes, in fact im running dapper beta, oddly enough
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	well i certainly don't run unstable on my colo server... its not for playing with :P
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	spikeb	delmar	i dont plan on upgrading until the next long term service release comes out, though :)
2006-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	delmar	spikeb	ok.. so I take it I just need to change some apt sources, apt-get update, and dist-upgrade and its on the way.. or is there more too it? hrm.
2006-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	spikeb		!upgrade
