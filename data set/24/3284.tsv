2008-03-06T18:08:00.000Z	swoopdk		and now i dont have a link to the desktop there anymore :(
2008-03-06T18:08:00.000Z	swoopdk		how can i restore that ?
2008-03-06T18:08:00.000Z	apo	swoopdk	Make a symlink
2008-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	swoopdk		i kinda just need to original "Desktop" folder/link back
2008-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	apo	swoopdk	ln -s ~/desktop ~/Desktop
2008-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	swoopdk	apo	will not work
2008-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	swoopdk		Desktop isnt there anymore
2008-03-06T18:09:00.000Z	swoopdk		i already renamed Desktop to desktop
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		... surely, the folder's still there?
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	swoopdk		the folder is
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		Well, then do that.
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	swoopdk		but it doesnt show its content on my desktop anymore
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		Obviously
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		It's searching for it in ~/Desktop
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		Not ~/desktop
2008-03-06T18:10:00.000Z	apo		That why I want you to make a symlink.
2008-03-06T18:12:00.000Z	swoopdk	apo	i renamed it back to Desktop but still nothing
2008-03-06T18:12:00.000Z	apo	swoopdk	Try restarting nautilus
2008-03-06T18:12:00.000Z	swoopdk		i can make the symlink easily (didnt think of it before i renamed of course :( )
2008-03-06T18:13:00.000Z	swoopdk		killall nautilus and nautilus ?
2008-03-06T18:13:00.000Z	apo	swoopdk	Yes
