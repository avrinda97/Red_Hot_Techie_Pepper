2011-04-30T11:56:00.000Z	virgilivs		maybe it installed another one that has higher priority in your environment
2011-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	virgilivs		damn it... why did I upgrade just to have these stupid new panels imposed on me
2011-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	you can change to classic or some other desktop
2011-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	do you have any idea how to re-upgrade? Mine did not compelte.
2011-04-30T11:59:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	first try sudo apt-get install -f to resolve any hanging issues and then apt-get update followed by apt-get upgrade
2011-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	thnaks, I'll try
2011-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	it told me to run dpkg --configure a.... oy vey
2011-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	what happened when you tried that?
2011-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	it's doing it... just taking forever as expected. it's just that its 3AM here
2011-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	I'm used to Arch Linux idiosyncrasies and updating things incrementally
2011-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	I find the best way is to start the upgrade about a month out while in beta and then just let it gradually upgrade... by opening day, its all done
2011-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	i'll try to remember that
2011-04-30T12:09:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	well, I tried apt-get update and upgrade and it thinks everythnig is fine
2011-04-30T12:09:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	but what does it know
2011-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	type lsb_release -a and see what it tells you
2011-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	everything reads nominal
2011-04-30T12:11:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	than you should be ok... what seems missing?
2011-04-30T12:12:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	not sure. the upgrade failed at configuring udisks with "5 minutes remaining" for the entire upgrade process. The system completely froze. I had to manually restart
2011-04-30T12:12:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	so is anything not working at the moment?
2011-04-30T12:13:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	not that I can tell, but it's still significant that it didn't finish, dont you think? it means there are now possibly dependency problems
2011-04-30T12:14:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	apt-get install -f should fix all dep problems
2011-04-30T12:15:00.000Z	virgilivs	jiohdi	then I'm totally confused about what it was doing.
2011-04-30T12:15:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	seems like you made it
2011-04-30T12:16:00.000Z	jiohdi	virgilivs	system issues can resolve on restarts
