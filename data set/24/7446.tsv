2004-11-27T09:57:00.000Z	FTTP	fubarpa	 My refresh rate went up from 75 to 85 but i can do alot higher, someone said it was due to the x.org
2004-11-27T09:57:00.000Z	FTTP		i dunno
2004-11-27T09:57:00.000Z	FTTP		i reported it as a bug tho since i can do 100+ in windows and other linuxes
2004-11-27T09:57:00.000Z	FTTP		err not sure about the other linuxes actually
2004-11-27T09:58:00.000Z	fubarpa		I haven't tested XOrg that much...  I've got an ATi card here
2004-11-27T09:58:00.000Z	FTTP		i thought it was but not 100% sure
2004-11-27T09:58:00.000Z	FTTP	fubarpa	 ubuntu has so much potential
2004-11-27T09:58:00.000Z	FTTP		the stock installer is horrible tho
2004-11-27T09:58:00.000Z	FTTP		and it needs more polish
2004-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	FTTP		the interface and everything is nice
2004-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	FTTP		its really nice for a 1st release
2004-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	fubarpa	FTTP	Agreed.  I'm quite happy with my switch from Gentoo
