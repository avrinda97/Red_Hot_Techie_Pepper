2008-09-16T20:52:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	no, xfce is not lighter than flux
2008-09-16T20:52:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	im using this laptop as a media pc, im running boxee, so i never even see the desktop unless I have to make some changes on the back end, what it looks like is not important, strickly lightweight and speed is all that matters
2008-09-16T20:53:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	ah, neat.
2008-09-16T20:53:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	have any suggestions
2008-09-16T20:54:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	are you already running the alternative version?
2008-09-16T20:54:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	no this originally was a mythbuntu install, i just install ubuntu desktop over it and removed all mythbuntu related packages
2008-09-16T20:55:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	if you're looking for a very very stripped down version of linux, you may want to consider looking into DSL (damn small linux)
2008-09-16T20:56:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	it isn't a ubuntu variant (I think it's a debian or knoppix variant) but their goal was to get it down to 50 mb.
2008-09-16T20:56:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	boxee is only really being developed for ubuntu based distros right now, and its running great, im not looking to test in on other distros right now if you know what i mean lol ;)
2008-09-16T20:56:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	 haha
2008-09-16T20:56:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	if it ain't broke....
2008-09-16T20:56:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	true that
2008-09-16T20:57:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	so you think maybe an alternate install of xfce?
2008-09-16T20:58:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	or maybe just an xubuntu install and uninstall all the crap i don't need
2008-09-16T20:58:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	yeah, if you want to stick within ubuntu-type distros, you might want to check out the alternate install of xubuntu.
2008-09-16T20:59:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	I have xubuntu 8.04 running of an acer aspire one (1.6 ghz / 1 g ram) and it flies pretty well.
2008-09-16T21:00:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	maybe i will do that, the normal xubuntu install will be much easier to get up and running with boxee so I don't exclude things I may need for it to run
2008-09-16T21:01:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	does xubuntu use xorg.conf? it took a long time for me to configure that properly to get my 42in widscreen to display at full resolution 1366x768
2008-09-16T21:02:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	if i can't get the res right, whats the point of a media pc ya know?
2008-09-16T21:03:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	haha, it should.  I don't know about conf difference between xfce and gnome.
2008-09-16T21:03:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	im going to install the xubuntu-desktop package and test boxee out on it then if all goes ok i'll do a fresh install
2008-09-16T21:04:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	cool.  good luck!  I gotta run.
2008-09-16T21:04:00.000Z	shawnrgr	flailingmaster	thanks for the help
2008-09-16T21:04:00.000Z	flailingmaster	shawnrgr	np.
