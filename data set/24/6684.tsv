2006-05-27T16:42:00.000Z	sybariten		what _is_ a subversion server ?
2006-05-27T16:43:00.000Z	sybariten		hm, nothing for a guy who hasnt learned to use cvs yet i guess
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	sybariten		what does that mean
2006-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	sybariten		ok how do i find out which version of ubuntu i am running ?
2006-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	lsb_release -a
2006-05-27T05:01:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	thank you
2006-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	packages that are from a later version of ubuntu but have been rebuilt for the current version
2006-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	yes
2006-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	lftp
2006-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	console ?
2006-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	yes
2006-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	ok ... as i said, i want a really advanced ftp client ...
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	I doubt any graphical client will be "really advanced", whatever that means
2006-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	ok we can turn this into a lengthy flamewar of whether its elite or not to run GUI tools, but i want something that can give me a nice bookmark list
2006-05-30T08:01:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	maybe gftp then
2006-05-30T08:02:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	google sftp
2006-05-30T08:02:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	sftp and ftp are completely different
2006-05-30T08:02:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	not from a users perspective, no
2006-05-30T08:03:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	irrelevant
2006-05-30T08:03:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	no .... its not ... i know that you're trying to teach me something or show that i'm wrong, but puhhleease
2006-05-30T08:04:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	my point is entirely valid. ftp is an insecure protocol, sftp is a secure protocol, the two are different, even though some graphical clients hide the differences. Look at gftp or filezilla - beyond that, nautilus' support for ftp/sftp, or lftp/ncftp you're pretty much out of options
2006-05-30T08:06:00.000Z	sybariten	Ng	i know too that sftp != ftp, that ftp is insecure, etc yadda yadda yadda and we can prolly go on all afternoon on who is "right" and not, but the fact remains the same: i was just looking for a client that handles secure file transfers as well as normal ftp, and does it elegantly
2006-05-30T08:06:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	well I've given you as many answers are there are, so you can continue to argue the point to yourself in #ubuntu-offtopic or actually go and investigate the options I suggested
2006-05-30T08:10:00.000Z	Ng	sybariten	I wasn't pushing my personal preferences on you, I was just telling you the truth. As I also said, if you want to rant, this is not the place.
