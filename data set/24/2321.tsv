2009-06-29T21:11:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		We have recently had to expand out subnet and I had to change my Jaunty desktop from a 10.1.1.x, 255.255.255.0 address to a 10.1.2.x, 255.255.252.0 address.  My problem is that I can only see about 1/2 the computers on the that still have the 10.1.1.x, 255.255.255.0 configuration.  Does the subnet matter on the other computers?
2009-06-29T21:11:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	yes
2009-06-29T21:12:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		why can i see 1/2 the computers then?
2009-06-29T21:13:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		We will not be able to change all of the subnets right away, is there any way around it?
2009-06-29T21:13:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	it may be becase of your switch and it may be misbehaving drivers.  But EVERYTHING you want to communcate must be ont eh same subnet otherwise its looking for the bordcasts int he wrong place(technically what your are doing is called suprtnetting)
2009-06-29T21:14:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	wow so it could be with the switch?
2009-06-29T21:14:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	do you have a layer 2 switch?
2009-06-29T21:14:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	yeah
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	then it may be "helping" you find the arp's of those boxes.  Really thoguh go fix your network
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	and that is why some are working and some not?
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	posibly
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	and others, thanks for the help
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	it also may just be the local arp cache of the systems
2009-06-29T21:16:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	i could see that
2009-06-29T21:16:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	no way around it then?
2009-06-29T21:16:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	i would have to route the traffic
2009-06-29T21:16:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		and have two different 255.255.255.0 networks right
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	sure, go set the netmask of all the boxes on it correctly and do not mix two networks on the same wire
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	we have a 20 year old Vax that no one knows how to change
2009-06-29T21:18:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	I would go find someone who does know, that or put a router in front of it and keep its network seperate
2009-06-29T21:18:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	again thanks for the help
2009-06-29T21:19:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	for that matter if you have a vax I would assume you have real rotuers, setup two more more vlans and put the vax on one and the rest on the other then route the two togehter
2009-06-29T21:20:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	mdm	that is a possibility
2009-06-29T21:22:00.000Z	mdm	BobTheBruin	really though I would find someone who knows OPenVMS and can set it.  Changing its IP is not that hard.
