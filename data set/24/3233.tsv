2008-07-19T15:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Lvl21nerd	ubuntuforums.org
2008-07-19T15:44:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd	RattX	: very helpful ...
2008-07-19T15:44:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		forums are slow though...
2008-07-19T15:44:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Lvl21nerd	don't want fast, or slow, hmm
2008-07-19T15:44:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		this is fast yes....but my eyes are nearly bleeding from sorting the text
2008-07-19T15:45:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd	RattX	: no need to be so rude
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		ok well how do i setup the swap partition on hardy 64bit
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		during installation or after?
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		yes
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		Vista
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		on 2 different hard drives
2008-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		both SATA II
2008-07-19T15:48:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		2 hard drives / both SATA II / Vista on one and Hardy 64bit on the other / have yet to get a decent explanation anywhere on the net
2008-07-19T15:52:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		ok i guess my next question is how to get flash plugin for firefox to work
2008-07-19T15:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Lvl21nerd	I'd solve both issues by removing the Vista HDD and installing 32bit Ubuntu on the 1st HDD (then when done, plug in the Vista drive as the second and add a GRUB entry to boot it)
2008-07-19T15:57:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		thx DistroJockey....but how do i add the grub entry....sry im very new at this
2008-07-19T15:57:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		ty MaximLevitsky i will try that
2008-07-19T15:58:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		do i just input that command or do i have to put something else in once that is input
2008-07-19T15:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Lvl21nerd	an entry like the following in  /boot/grub/menu.lst  should do the job:  http://pastebin.com/ma64d0d7
2008-07-19T15:59:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		very good ty
2008-07-19T16:00:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		and i take it that there is an IRC client for Ubuntu?
2008-07-19T16:00:00.000Z	Lvl21nerd		would only make sense
2008-07-19T16:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Lvl21nerd	pidgin by default, but xchat is recommended
