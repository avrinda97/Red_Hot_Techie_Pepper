2007-11-17T22:36:00.000Z	greencookie		hello
2007-11-17T22:38:00.000Z	greencookie		my desktop's ctr+alt+f1 function doesnt work anymore. Could someone let me know how I can fix that?
2007-11-17T22:40:00.000Z	greencookie		is there a way to enable/disable the alt+ctrl+fx keyboard shortcuts?
2007-11-17T22:40:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	it's a menu item
2007-11-17T22:41:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	oops, no it's not
2007-11-17T22:41:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	can u point me out?
2007-11-17T22:41:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	oh ok.
2007-11-17T22:41:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	system consoles are not configurable
2007-11-17T22:42:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	on my desktop with gutsy, the ctrl+alt+fx keys dont work. any idea what the problem could be?
2007-11-17T22:42:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	they don't work?  that would be very unusual.  have you mapped the ctrl or alt keys?
2007-11-17T22:43:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	yes, in keyboard panel of gnome. how do i unmap/default it?
2007-11-17T22:45:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	Can you try creating a new user and seeing if it happens under that account?
2007-11-17T22:45:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	I hadn't thought about that. Brb.
2007-11-17T22:48:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	It still doesnt work even when i log in as new admin user.
2007-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	This is weird, but at least you don't have to much with your GNOME settings.
2007-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	I dunno, I only have gnome on my desktop no kubuntu.
2007-11-17T22:50:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	I don't know what to tell you next.
2007-11-17T22:50:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	lol. its cool, ill try to figure it out.
2007-11-17T22:51:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	sounds like a hardware issue
2007-11-17T22:51:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	bios??
2007-11-17T22:53:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	lol I have no idea. my computer does hang every now and then on boot at the bios check.
2007-11-17T22:54:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	might be worth your time exploring the keyboard settings there -- or trying a different default keyboard in GNOME
2007-11-17T22:54:00.000Z	greencookie	desertc	will do. Thanks a LOT for hearing me out:
2007-11-17T22:54:00.000Z	desertc	greencookie	You bet.
