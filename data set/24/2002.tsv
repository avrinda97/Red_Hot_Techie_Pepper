2009-05-25T09:42:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		why do I have to click my drive so that ubuntu "detects" it
2009-05-25T09:43:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		for example the screen is white before I open my drive first time after boot
2009-05-25T09:43:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		because the wallpaper is loaded from there
2009-05-25T09:44:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	what do you mean?
2009-05-25T09:45:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		hapreet_: the wallpaper is loaded from my other drive, the screen stays white until I open the drive for the first time
2009-05-25T09:45:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	so you saying is you have more than one drive on your system and wallpaper is loaded from the other drive and you have to click onthat drive tohave the wallpaper working?
2009-05-25T09:45:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		and it puts the icon to the desktop
2009-05-25T09:45:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu	harpreet_	yea
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	because, your other drive requires authorization as sudo to access files from there, its a security feature ubuntu has
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		aha
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		can it be overwritten?
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	yes
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		right, how is that done?
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		:)
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	when you click on the other drive, ask it to automount
2009-05-25T09:46:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu		okay
2009-05-25T09:47:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	and you can go on system > login window >automatic logon
2009-05-25T09:47:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	i assume you put password to connect to otherdrive when you have to click on that right?
2009-05-25T09:48:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu	harpreet_	umm, no :/
2009-05-25T09:49:00.000Z	harpreet_	tuhis-ubu	then you have to manually edit a file to automount your other partition as boot
2009-05-25T09:49:00.000Z	tuhis-ubu	harpreet_	how do I do that?
