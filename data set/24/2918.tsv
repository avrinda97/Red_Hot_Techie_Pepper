2009-02-08T19:12:00.000Z	uni4dfx		my win key doesn't work... i need to reinstall ubuntu for that right?
2009-02-08T19:13:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	no, you don't need to reinstall. the key very likely just isn't configured right
2009-02-08T19:14:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	how do i check if it's configured right
2009-02-08T19:20:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	found that? in the keyboard setup application there's a tab called "layout", where you find a button "other options" there you can open a menu in which you can for example set up a specific behaviour for the alt/ and win keys.
2009-02-08T19:21:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	yea i found it, the current alt/win option is "default"
2009-02-08T19:22:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	then try to set it to "Meta is mapped to the Win-keys"
2009-02-08T19:23:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	tried, but it still won't show up in xev
2009-02-08T19:24:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	ok. then you checked if you setup the right keyboard layout? (in the GUI and in you Xorg.conf)
2009-02-08T19:26:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	yes... though i can't seem to select a default layout in the Keyboard settings.. all the optionboxes are unselected
2009-02-08T19:28:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	weird, but i just reproduced the behavior of the win key not showing up in xev when I put it's behavior to default. Selecting the default layout doesn't work?
2009-02-08T19:29:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	will it make it default if i just have one layout in that list?
2009-02-08T19:29:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	even though the "Default" optionbox is unchecked
2009-02-08T19:30:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	I'm not sure, but I here also have only one layout and it's selected
2009-02-08T19:31:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	just to show i'm not making stuff up: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/121855/Screenshot-Keyboard%20Preferences.png
2009-02-08T19:31:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	I believe you, I had that too some time ago
2009-02-08T19:34:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	i think the entire ubuntu keyboard/key mapping and layout business is a total mess
2009-02-08T19:34:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	you're using a logitech g15? it seems to be a bit tricky... already checked that: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LogitechG15 ?
2009-02-08T19:35:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	the thing is, it was all working until i installed and removed scim
2009-02-08T19:35:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	it's at least a bit weird
2009-02-08T19:42:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	never tried scim, so i can't really help there. If you know where the scim configuration is stored, you could try to remove this
2009-02-08T19:42:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	the scim configuration is scattered all over the system, and i have no idea how it interacts with with xmodmap either
2009-02-08T19:43:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	that's why i wish to reinstall all the X-related config files
2009-02-08T19:44:00.000Z	W_McL	uni4dfx	did you already try to rename the gnome related configuration directories to see if it works with a new clean gnome config? this might safe you reinstalling all X related stuff#
2009-02-08T19:45:00.000Z	uni4dfx	W_McL	i don't think a local user config is the problem,... it's probably global, but i can try to make a new user just in case, hold on
