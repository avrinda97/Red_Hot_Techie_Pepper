2005-10-02T08:47:00.000Z	difeta		I've upgraded to ubuntu and I'm running an nvidia card, when i try to startx I get an error that says caught singal 11. The log does not have any extra information. Any ideas?
2005-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	what kernel?
2005-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent 2.6.12-9
2005-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	difeta	mrimbert	nope.
2005-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	apt-get install linux-modules-restricted-2.6.12-9
2005-10-02T08:51:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	then go into xorg.conf and change /usr/lib/X11/fonts/blah to /usr/share/X11/fonts/blah
2005-10-02T08:51:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	and you may need to change your keyboard driver name from keyboard to kbd
2005-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	i assume you are in the same position i was earlier. using nvidia driver, dist-upgrade to breezy, and xorg wont start up
2005-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent thats right
2005-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	difeta	mrimbert	thanks
2005-10-02T08:52:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	if you check those things i told you it should come up nicely
2005-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	and you may want to change firefox fonts to bitstream fonts because they look nasty otherwise
2005-10-02T08:54:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent none of that worked. Whats wierd is I can use the vesa or nv driver. But not the nvidia driver
2005-10-02T08:55:00.000Z	adjacent		do you have the 2.6.12-9 restricted modules?
2005-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent yes, I have the proper restriced modules
2005-10-02T08:57:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	if there is nothing in /var/log/Xorg.0.log im stumped too. sorry
2005-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent when i attempt to startx I see an nvidia logo, but the X log says something like. "agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 0000:01:00.0 into 4x mode"
2005-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent thats the last line.
2005-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent I'd like to jsut reinstall the whole dang thing. But for some reason cdrecord wont work either
2005-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	looks like a bug. possibly downgrade udev
2005-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent in cdrecord?
2005-10-02T09:04:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	im not sure. but it sounds like hotplug or udev is having a problem....
2005-10-02T09:04:00.000Z	difeta		adjacent Then I'll boot into knoppix, burn the cd and reinstall this bad boy. I suspect m cutomization have cased problems
2005-10-02T09:04:00.000Z	adjacent	difeta	good luck
