2010-11-18T09:57:00.000Z	Ronaldlo		I have a iMac G4. I installed the alternate community port for ppc. Yet at the boot screen it never loads past two dots.
2010-11-18T09:57:00.000Z	Ronaldlo		Any thing I could do?
2010-11-18T09:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	does your memory test as healthy?
2010-11-18T10:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	hold shift at boot, select memtest
2010-11-18T10:11:00.000Z	Ronaldlo	ActionParsnip	not much happened when I held shift. yaboot, the to the ubuntu 10.10 splash screen, then nothing. When I held shift, it had a black screen for a long time.

2010-11-18T10:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	its before the splash shows
2010-11-18T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	thats how its done in grub2
2010-11-18T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	if you have the liveCD you can test there too
2010-11-18T10:43:00.000Z	Ronaldlo	ActionParsnip	I realized that the load goes farther when holding down shift. Any other keys I can hold to get it to the very end ;)
2010-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	Ronaldlo	ActionParsnip	Do you do this as a job? Or are you just really really cool anyhow? ;)
2010-11-18T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	depends on demand I guess
2010-11-18T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	you could as a pal with a whizzy connection to make you a cd or usb. If you don't want/can't download the cd yourself
2010-11-18T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	CDs are 700mb
2010-11-18T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	so a mac can't boot usb?
2010-11-18T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	if you can boot floppy there is a floppy image you can boot to, to kick of the usb installer
2010-11-18T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	head over to the pendrivelinux site. The image is there
2010-11-18T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	if they have a ppc one, yes :) otherwise no :(
2010-11-18T12:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	its a decent distro
2010-11-18T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	could use the minimal ppc iso, then install lubuntu-desktop for super lightness :)
2010-11-18T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	there's 32bit ppc minimal. And 64bit ppc minimal. Result!
2010-11-18T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	use the one ubottu gave
2010-11-18T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	minimal gives kernel + bootloader + modules
2010-11-18T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ronaldlo	experiment with different distros if you like, each has advantages
