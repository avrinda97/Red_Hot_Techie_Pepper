2011-12-30T11:16:00.000Z	matt3940gmail		ok this sound stupid but to talk to someone you have ton type ther nick in every time you say something to them
2011-12-30T11:18:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	also might trigger an alert that a message is being directed to the user in their IRC client, when you mention their username
2011-12-30T11:21:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	do u use a linux machine only i am looking for a good windows emmulator
2011-12-30T11:22:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	I rarely use Windows, but VirtualBox is a FLOSS virtual machine that will let you run Windows inside a virtual machine inside Ubuntu. You can install VirtualBox from the Ubuntu Software Centre.
2011-12-30T11:23:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	or, you can check out Wine, which lets you run some Windows applications from GNU/Linux (rather than running the whole operating system, like with VirtualBox
2011-12-30T11:25:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok i will try that i have 3 programs that do not support linux i tryed wine but so far no luck i am out of my ellemt here in linux i was preety good with windows but after vista i begain to hate it
2011-12-30T11:27:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	ok, try VirtuaBox. Might take some effort to set up (you have to install Windows inside the virtual machine), but search the web for tutorials, and once you get it running you'll be able to run those programs inside the virtual machine no problem.
2011-12-30T11:30:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok i am now on a search for a windows os to give it i used vbon my windows maching so i kina know whats going on with it but in the fusteration a week ago i formatted my hd windows bye bye
2011-12-30T11:31:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	it's easier to reinstall anyways. Do you have a Windows install CD?
2011-12-30T11:34:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	sorry forgot to tag that one
2011-12-30T11:35:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	I prefer xp over vista myself
2011-12-30T11:37:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok one thing with ubuntu 10 . 4 how do i get it to stop asking for password every time i go to install something fromsoftware center
2011-12-30T11:37:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	usually it remembers your password for at least a little while? like, 5 or 10 minutes at least, I think? I'm on 11.10 though.
2011-12-30T11:39:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok when you go to a diffren verision ex.10.4  to 11.10 will i loose all my data
2011-12-30T11:40:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	nope, upgrades are pretty smooth, but you can't skip versions (so you'd have to upgrade three times, 10.04 => 10.10 => 11.04 => 11.10)
2011-12-30T11:41:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	I started out with 6.06 for awhile, as the LTS in 2007, then went through a series of upgrades to catch up to the regular releases after a few months... probably worth it, unless you really need the stabilty of an LTS (12.04 is supposed to be an LTS anyways, I think)
2011-12-30T11:46:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	If you don't want to wait for 12.04 and want to go through 10.10 and 11.04 to 11.10, you would go to System > Administration > Update Manager I believe. You have to make sure that under System > Administration > Softwware Sources, it's set to notify of normal releases and not just LTS
2011-12-30T11:51:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	ubuntu.com download is for new installs, Update Manager for upgrades
2011-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok now i see i checked for new uddates last night and it sayed i was up to date but i just looked and i was set on lts only so i am going to set it to normal
2011-12-30T11:55:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	see message above for you
2011-12-30T11:56:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	it says 10.10 is available will the comp. shut down during or after the upgrade
2011-12-30T12:00:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	shut down after, it usually takes me 1.5 hours for the download portion and half an hour for the upgrade portion of the whole thing, give or take 20 minutes
2011-12-30T12:01:00.000Z	balleyne	matt3940gmail	gotta run, best of luck
2011-12-30T12:01:00.000Z	matt3940gmail	balleyne	ok thanks
