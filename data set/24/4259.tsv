2007-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	wastedf		but grub can't find it, but i redirected the menu.lst
2007-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	wastedf		updated the UUID, and the root hd
2007-07-04T12:05:00.000Z	wastedf		I updated fstab.. fstab doesn't activate until you boot, right?
2007-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	wastedf		well, i can't even get past grub.. so fstab is useless to me now; what does device.map do, holycow?
2007-07-04T12:06:00.000Z	wastedf		I changed all five of them.. I had 5 test options, i changed 'em all
2007-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	wastedf		I'm guessing I guessed the root            (hd0,1) wrong..  how can I doube check holycow?
2007-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	wastedf		kopt ??
2007-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	wastedf		I updated the UUID too
2007-07-04T12:07:00.000Z	wastedf		just copy/pasted from dumpe2fs
2007-07-04T12:08:00.000Z	wastedf		i'm on the live cd now :p
2007-07-04T12:09:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	correct
2007-07-04T12:09:00.000Z	wastedf	holycow	do you know where I can verify what root hd setting grub uses?
2007-07-04T12:10:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	just tray /dev/hda or similar
2007-07-04T12:10:00.000Z	wastedf	holycow	-> root            (hd0,1) is what I have.  It needs to boot off hda2.  I read a tutorial that said hda2 = minus one = '1"
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	lol i can't remember :)
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	wastedf		shiat
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	wastedf		it's got to be
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	lol sorry, i had a few beers
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	wastedf		the root.. because the root=UUID= in the kernel line is right
2007-07-04T12:11:00.000Z	wastedf		so it HAS to be the root hd0,1 line
2007-07-04T12:12:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	ah i see feisty does menu.lst a wee bit different
2007-07-04T12:13:00.000Z	holycow		i'd haveto play with it to see exactly what its doing, on dapper its a bit simpler although the mechanics are probably the same
2007-07-04T12:14:00.000Z	wastedf	holycow	got one more second?  I ran grub off the live cd.. it foun the rot.. but setup isn't a recognized command to write it to the MBR
2007-07-04T12:14:00.000Z	holycow	wastedf	yeah there is a weirdass way to run it, i forget, i once had to do it and decided reinstalling from scratch was easier.  you will haveto google that too
