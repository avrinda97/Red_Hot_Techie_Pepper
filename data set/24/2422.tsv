2009-02-25T16:29:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	not sure if you were refering to my questions, but i have checked the compiz resize and move plugins and gnome keyboard settings,, they're not available.

2009-05-06T14:17:00.000Z	shadeslayer	NET||abuse	strange,i can see it quite clearly.....ah,did you set it to scan recursively?
2009-05-06T14:17:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	you sure? banshee  1.2.1

2009-05-06T14:19:00.000Z	shadeslayer	NET||abuse	no idea then....maybe its under edit > prefrences
2009-05-06T14:19:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	been looking through all dialogs, just not seeing anything.
2009-05-06T14:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	i have to import again or else it doesn't pick anything up.. but now it's 56% through the scanning,, and the scan has frozen
2009-05-06T14:22:00.000Z	shadeslayer	NET||abuse	http://www.nabble.com/Doesn%27t-pick-up-music-files-td20282994.html
2009-05-06T14:23:00.000Z	shadeslayer	NET||abuse	i think you have to import the folder again
2009-05-06T14:25:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	i've tried, the scanning dialog hasn't gone past 56% since 4 minutes ago
2009-05-06T14:25:00.000Z	shadeslayer	NET||abuse	very large audio file? :P
2009-05-06T14:26:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	shouldn't be too big a file in there at all... one album rap perhaps, only 70MB, shouldn't cause an issue.
2009-05-06T14:27:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	yeh, it's just sitting there using 46% cpu in sysmonitor, and not proceeding.
2009-05-06T14:28:00.000Z	NET||abuse	shadeslayer	wish i could see which file it's touching
