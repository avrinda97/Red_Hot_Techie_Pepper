2005-05-11T16:38:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: how can I put it back in a new tab?
2005-05-11T16:38:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	maybe in the Tab section of preferences, Open utilities in Tabs? not sure tho
2005-05-11T16:39:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: Okay... I've check everywhere ... no idea where the config could be.... anybody know where I can find that?
2005-05-11T16:42:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: nope... still dosen't work.....
2005-05-11T16:44:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	not sure it can be done
2005-05-11T16:45:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: it was working before... I don't know what I done to broke it... but I'm sure it was working... so dumb I am!
2005-05-11T16:45:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	its always been like that here
2005-05-11T16:46:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: really??? humm... maybe I mix thing with windows....
2005-05-11T16:47:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	i've asked a friend, he doesn't know either. He says that he uses kde's window controller to prevent it from stealing focus, but i don't know what else you could do
2005-05-11T16:48:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: Okay.... thanks for your help... I least I will not waste my time on that non existent problem :)
2005-05-11T16:49:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	its really annoying tho, maybe worth filing a bug if it doesn't already exist
2005-05-11T16:49:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: It was working on previous release?
2005-05-11T16:50:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	you could try this: prefs/interface/tabs focus new tabs/never
2005-05-11T16:55:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: it dosen't work ... but forget it... I will live with that :)
2005-05-11T16:55:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	i'm asking in #xchat
2005-05-11T16:55:00.000Z	Bily	mdke	: okay!
2005-05-11T16:58:00.000Z	mdke	Bily	it is: settings > preferences > tabs > open utilities in > TAB
