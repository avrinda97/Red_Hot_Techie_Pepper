2008-03-09T20:18:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	err
2008-03-09T20:18:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	...you shouldnt be missing that file
2008-03-09T20:19:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	i have tried that in "several installations", never produced a result for me
2008-03-09T20:20:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	the file exists there, when i browse from nautilus
2008-03-09T20:20:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	are you trying to find as normal user, or sudo?
2008-03-09T20:23:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	i dont know why he's using find tho.. all it's going to do is say "LOL there's a file here"
2008-03-09T20:23:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	it isnt going to say anything about where the boot partition is
2008-03-09T20:23:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	not really
2008-03-09T20:24:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	^
2008-03-09T20:24:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	thats fine, but all 'find' does is locate a file.  that's it.  it isnt going to tell you what the file contains.
2008-03-09T20:25:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	correct
2008-03-09T20:29:00.000Z	vox	Gurpartap	if you want to know what device you boot from, asfar as grub is concerned, simply 'cat /boot/grub/menu.lst'  and look at the first entry
2008-03-09T20:30:00.000Z	Gurpartap	vox	(hd0,4) :D
