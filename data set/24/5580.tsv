2006-06-12T10:54:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		hey guys, can any of you recommend a good application for docking software to the system tray?
2006-06-12T10:54:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		I heard of kdocker, is that good?
2006-06-12T10:54:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		does ubuntu support that natively or do I need a 3rd part yapp
2006-06-12T10:56:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		just looking to dock applications to the system tray, apps like Thunderbird and XMMS
2006-06-12T10:57:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		so, any recommendations on docker apps?
2006-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		guys, does anyone have a recommendation on a docker app?
2006-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		guys, I'm sure no one really sees my messages because there's so many in here. I'm looking for a docker application that allows me to dock running software to the system tray and remove it from the task bar (applications like thunderbird and xmms that are usually always running). Any recommendations would be GREATLY appreciate, thanks guys!
2006-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	RamiKassab_		sorry for it being so long, I had asked like 4 times but I don't think anyone say the messages
