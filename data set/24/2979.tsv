2008-06-28T00:43:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		how can i find out what my windows HDD address is? i.e. (hd0,0) i am running a dual boot system and need it for the grub boot loader, dont know how to extract that info with ubuntu tried fdisk -l in a terminal but it just spit me back out to user@computer prompt
2008-06-28T00:43:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	Did you use wubi?
2008-06-28T00:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	(hd1,0)
2008-06-28T01:07:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	still no luck with the bootloader still hanging when i select windows, it goes to black screen with "Starting up ... " in white letters and just sits there i have to ctrl+alt+del to restart my computer.... and i have to change the boot sequence in my bios to boot into windows
2008-06-28T01:08:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	You could just keep guessing at it, just push 'e' at the boot menu and keep trying (hdX,0)
2008-06-28T01:11:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	i tried hd0,0 hd 1,0 hd0,1 hd 1,1 all to no avail, i don't think it would be anything else, i changed the boot order to install windows to my slave drive because i installed windows after ubuntu, could that be a possible problem?
2008-06-28T01:11:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	Installing Windows after Ubuntu is always tricky. I don't have that much experience with it, but the grub factoid supposedly has a great howto, don't know if that's what you were following or not
2008-06-28T01:15:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	i even saved that webpage so i could copy and paste the lines to make sure i didnt typo, just changed the hd location accordingly
2008-06-28T01:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	Hmmm, but you can still boot from Windows? what does your sudo fdisk -l say again?
2008-06-28T01:16:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	yeah i can still boot into windows but i have to change my boot sequence, how do i pastebin? i will pastebin the result of fdisk -l
2008-06-28T01:21:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	i guess this is the URL? http://paste.ubuntu.com/23358/
2008-06-28T01:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	So sdb1 is definitely your Windows install? Not hde1?
2008-06-28T01:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	Ok, I guess the next thing to do would be to pastebin the contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-28T01:26:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	http://paste.ubuntu.com/23360/ contents of /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-28T01:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	I dunno... start spamming grub-install :P or ask advice from someone smarter than me :-/
2008-06-28T01:29:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	lol thanx anyways
2008-06-28T01:31:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	nah you got me a little better of an understanding as to why i should have left it the hell alone lol
2008-06-28T01:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	That idea made sense in my head. setup BIOS such that it avoids grub and automatically boots into windows. Once that is going use a live-cd to boot into Ubuntu and then do a grub-install on the primary drive
2008-06-28T01:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	But I fail a lot, so take it for what it's worth
2008-06-28T01:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	I think you need to set your BIOS up so that it automatically boots into Windows, and then once you've done that, boot to a live-cd and do a grub-install on the windows drive
2008-06-28T01:40:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	that may work i think i changed the boot sequence before i reinstalled grub
2008-06-28T01:40:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	Right, and that's what's ticking windows off
2008-06-28T01:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	KRaZy_WaKa	So get it setup such that you can boot into Windows and Windows only, then live-cd it, then grub-install it, best thing I can think of
2008-06-28T01:46:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	ASULutzy	ah well time to reboot, reinstall grub hopefully i get it right this time, will return with the results lol
