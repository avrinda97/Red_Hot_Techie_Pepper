2008-12-10T19:15:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	system - preferences - sound is a good place to start from..
2008-12-10T19:16:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	I have had no problem with sound on this machine since Ubuntu 6.x sometime during 8.04 it stopped. I tested recently with a 7.4 live cd and it was fine. have now upgraded to 8.10 and still no sound
2008-12-10T19:17:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	i lost count of how many people encountered problems with sound on 8.10
2008-12-10T19:18:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	my problems started with 8.04
2008-12-10T19:18:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	choose the proper device first, then try alsa as output
2008-12-10T19:19:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	in regards to "chose proper device" is that via asoundconf ?
2008-12-10T19:21:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	right click on your volume icon, choose preferences i think then a dropdown box may have options
2008-12-10T19:24:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	don't mean to be a pain, and I  understand you are probably tired of the same old same old.. how do I know what the right device is ?
2008-12-10T19:25:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	in my experience i try everything until it works.
2008-12-10T19:26:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	which devices do you show?
2008-12-10T19:26:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	for example my first one is 'Intel ICH5 (Alsa mixer) but a second list show options like 'Master, PCM...'
2008-12-10T19:27:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	use the intel, thats onboard sound chip, open controls and un-mute and set levels
2008-12-10T19:28:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	second device 'Analog Devices AD1985 (OSS...)'
2008-12-10T19:29:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	try both, i wish i could be more specific.
2008-12-10T19:30:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	what are options in the second list, like 'Master, Master Mono, PCM' should these be selected also ?
2008-12-10T19:31:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	yes, set those levels up high, especially master and pcm
2008-12-10T19:32:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	I don't mean in the levels, but in the speaker icon preferences
2008-12-10T19:34:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	when you right click, choose open controls, check the controls, if that doesnt work, change device and try controls again.
2008-12-10T19:35:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	it takes toying with but it'll work eventually.
2008-12-10T19:37:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	awesome you are a champion. One of the setting using the Intel device had option 'Exchange Front/Surrond' ticked.. turned it off and I have sound. Although I have loud buzzing/ringing
2008-12-10T19:38:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	try muting your mic or auxilary
2008-12-10T19:41:00.000Z	hipitihop	gnutron	yip that helps but not totally gone. as you say, have to play around. I now know enough to be dangerous. thanks
2008-12-10T19:41:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	good luck, i know its frustrating
2008-12-10T19:44:00.000Z	gnutron	hipitihop	do try to use alsa not oss in sound / preferences
