2008-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	desolate		!tab what
2008-06-08T08:15:00.000Z	desolate		Should i just dive straight into ubuntu and start playing with it, or read up on it first?
2008-06-08T08:16:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	whichever you prefer.
2008-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	To use linux, you have to realize it is not better or worse than windows or OSX, it is (first and foremost) DIFFRENT.
2008-06-08T08:20:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	well i've played with it a bit and im just alittle hesitant I don't want to start messing around and make a mess of it
2008-06-08T08:21:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	try using a live disk for a whole day (use a usb drive for saving) and see how it works.
2008-06-08T08:22:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	I do want to add some of the great desktop features i've seen. Like the burning/sparkling, cube, the icons on the bottom like mac, stuff like that.
2008-06-08T08:23:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	most of the fancy features are enabled by default on Hardy Heron (current version) if your graphics card is supported.
2008-06-08T08:24:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	well i have a radeon 1900xtx should I download drivers? If so where?
2008-06-08T08:25:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	I don't know how well the 1900xtx is supported. You would need to research that a little bit. It would likely need a reboot or two (after installation) to get the fancy effects working.
2008-06-08T08:26:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	you should be able to download them through the restricted drivers manager once you install. Not possible to use from the live disk directly IIRC
2008-06-08T08:29:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	oh i see so heron has most of those features already?
2008-06-08T08:30:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	yep. they just need enabling once the graphics drivers are in place. Hardy does its best to have the drivers ready for you, and if so, the neat graphics will be pre-enabled
2008-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	had i not had heron and had to go about getting those features what would i do?
2008-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	see the terminal is where I get lost I have no idea how to use the terminal
2008-06-08T08:34:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	that is why we are around to help. Just come and ask.
2008-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	awesome should i ditch windows?
2008-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	at this point all i need to do is backup my media and im good to go it seems
2008-06-08T08:35:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	try dual booting until you are comfortable, or use a spare machine.
2008-06-08T08:36:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	for programs like itunes, mirc, aim, and other games do i need emulators?
2008-06-08T08:37:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	I've had good luck using amarok for my ipod's music management. Pidgin (included) is excellent for AIM/MSN/YAHOO replacement and xchat is good for irc
2008-06-08T08:37:00.000Z	desolate	BZWingZero	so i can still talk to people on aim using pidgin, and i can still use an ipod with banshee/amarok
2008-06-08T08:38:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	yes, you can use pidgin for aim (there is even a windows version available). I haven't used banshee but amarok worked fine for me. However it doens't do itune's DRMd files.
2008-06-08T08:39:00.000Z	BZWingZero	desolate	not a problem.
