2010-03-17T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	what do you get?
2010-03-17T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	can you boot to recovery mode root console?
2010-03-17T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	is it named busybox?
2010-03-17T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	please use my nick at the start of lines, its very confusing otherwise, you can use tab to complete nicks
2010-03-17T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	i see ok then your grub is borked
2010-03-17T14:28:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: what do I have to do in order to recover from there?
2010-03-17T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	do you know which partition your boot is on?
2010-03-17T14:29:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: nope I know that it is on my third disk
2010-03-17T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	this will help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 scroll to "command line and rescue mode"
2010-03-17T14:30:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: lettme check this one
2010-03-17T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	i havent used wubi (and think the idea stinks) so you cannot boot to liveCD to fix grub but the guide should tell you how to kick the boot off manually then you can fix grub on the desktop
2010-03-17T14:31:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: I hv used wubi installed under Win XP
2010-03-17T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	i know, thats gonna really hold back on what you can do to fix this
2010-03-17T14:33:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: is it advicable to uninstall and reinstall this?
2010-03-17T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ramsrambo	if its a clean install, why not. Did you MD5 test the wubi file you downloaded?
2010-03-17T14:34:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	: Nope I did not do that How can I do that?
2010-03-17T14:35:00.000Z	Ramsrambo	ActionParsnip	 : How can I check the ISO image for MD5?
