2005-07-09T08:13:00.000Z	luminerd		yay :) GIMP!!
2005-07-09T08:13:00.000Z	luminerd		does Audacity come?
2005-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	come again? audacity does work, but you need to disable esd first.
2005-07-09T08:15:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	esd is the sound daemon that Ubuntu uses by default. And cafuego's right on target - you'll need to enable the universe repository to install audacity.
2005-07-09T08:18:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	alsa can be configured (via dmix) to output multiple sounds simultaneously.
2005-07-09T08:18:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	in fact, it's enabled by default in Breezy.
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	do you have the main repository enabled?
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	luminerd	crimsun	umm, universe/
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	no, main.
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	luminerd	crimsun	how do I do so?
2005-08-10T09:20:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-08-10T09:20:00.000Z	luminerd	crimsun	do what?
2005-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	open a konsole and type sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	luminerd	crimsun	well I know that but edit it with what? sorry
2005-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	luminerd	crimsun	so what do I add?
2005-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	crimsun	luminerd	you need a line containing main
