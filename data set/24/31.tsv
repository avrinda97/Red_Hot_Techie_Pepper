2012-10-29T17:43:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	what commadn to cehck the version of xorg?
2012-10-29T17:44:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	I'll look into that. I'm not sure right off-hand.
2012-10-29T17:47:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	X -version
2012-10-29T17:48:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	X.Org X Server 1.13.0
2012-10-29T17:49:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	so i guess my card falled on the affected radeon card series
2012-10-29T17:49:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	I guess so. You could try the third option (adding the ppa, update, upgrade, and install). My X version is 1.12.3 after doing that.
2012-10-29T17:52:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	no, i dont want other ppl repo
2012-10-29T17:53:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	just want official repo
2012-10-29T17:53:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	I'm not sure what to tell you then. I can tell you that I'm using the ppa without any problems.  But, your mileage may vary.
2012-10-29T17:53:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	and I totally respect you for not wanting to use it.
2012-10-29T17:54:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	thanks, i have removed fglrx fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-updates xorg-driver-fglrx
2012-10-29T18:01:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	optraz	I'm not sure what dependencies you need to get it to do the buildpkg portion.
2012-10-29T18:01:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	no, that amd driver does not have for quantal but the link that you gave me said that option is available
2012-10-29T18:06:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	no.. nvm
2012-10-29T18:54:00.000Z	optraz	PatrickDickey	not good... driver install but reso is low
