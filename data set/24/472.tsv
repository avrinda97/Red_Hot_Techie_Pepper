2012-02-19T06:50:00.000Z	p3rsist		Hi. How can I make rsync to not overwrite permissions on destination host?
2012-02-19T06:51:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	-p
2012-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	I tried -p but it preserves permissions from the local host... and try to overwrite destination's permissions. I want to preserver destination's permission
2012-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	-p preserve permissions ( from source ) if you don't it don't use -p nope?
2012-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	okey...but its already preserving from source... and I don't use -preserve...
2012-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	or you can use --chmod or -p with -A = acl
2012-02-19T06:55:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	so you get some permission error when execute rsync?
2012-02-19T06:56:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	I use -zrv and --delete
2012-02-19T06:57:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	try using --chmod= with permission that you want
2012-02-19T06:58:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	--chmod=666
2012-02-19T06:59:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	but what kind of filesystem host have
2012-02-19T06:59:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	ext3
2012-02-19T06:59:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	ok
2012-02-19T07:00:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	there are many option about permission on rsync
2012-02-19T07:01:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	I guess so...but why will it try to preserve permissions if.. i dont ask it to do so...
2012-02-19T07:05:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	so try to set your permission with --chmod
2012-02-19T07:06:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	can I also change remote group ownership with rsync?
2012-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	p3rsist -o owner -g group
2012-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	-o super-user-only
2012-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	look at the man rsync
2012-02-19T07:10:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	so I think that -p preserve permission on destination, not from source
2012-02-19T07:33:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	well I made some test, you can change permission for group and others, using rsync -rzvp --chmod=g+rwx,o+r /source/ destination it sets drwxrwxr-- on destination, you can't change owner
2012-02-19T07:34:00.000Z	exutux	p3rsist	--chmode needs -p
2012-02-19T07:35:00.000Z	p3rsist	exutux	Thanks
