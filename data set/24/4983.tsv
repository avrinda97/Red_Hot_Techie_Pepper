2009-07-02T08:33:00.000Z	shane2peru		I have a serious problem with my network settings on jaunty, how can I purge them and completely install them like the beginning?  I really hate the new jaunty network system
2009-07-02T08:34:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	install wicd and laugh at all the suckers using network manager
2009-07-02T08:34:00.000Z	shane2peru		is there any gui tool to work with network settings?
2009-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	it seems as though they did away with network manager
2009-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	it used to be nice, now it is a nightmere
2009-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	shane2peru		is wicd easy, or is it going to hose my system?
2009-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	^^^
2009-07-02T08:36:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	well I haven't used anything but wicd in over a year now, it's superior to the way they were doing it
2009-07-02T08:37:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	at this point I would try anything, thanks for the tip, installing now.
2009-07-02T08:37:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	will this auto-replace my current messed up network manager?
2009-07-02T08:37:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	I believe it will uninstall it
2009-07-02T08:38:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	been over a year since I did it, I don't quite remember
2009-07-02T08:38:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	it just dumped my applet, and seemingly disconnected me, but here I am. :)
2009-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	how do I edit wicd, or get into it?
2009-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	Applications->Internet
2009-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	ahh, there it is, thanks
2009-07-02T08:40:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	the best part is, once you have everything setup, it will do the network config before login, so you get network before you are even logged in
2009-07-02T08:40:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	cool even got my dns stuff again
2009-07-02T08:40:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	I think in hardy or intrepid it was simple and usable, either intrepid or juanty made a mess out of it, and took away the gui tools to fix things
2009-07-02T08:41:00.000Z	Dulak	shane2peru	I never liked that I didn't get network until after login, that's why I originally switched
2009-07-02T08:41:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	I guess that didn't matter to me so much, just to be able to tinker and configure stuff was what I was lookng for.

2009-07-02T08:42:00.000Z	shane2peru	Dulak	thanks for the tip on wicd, hopefully that will fix my issue, very easy and straight forward to use
