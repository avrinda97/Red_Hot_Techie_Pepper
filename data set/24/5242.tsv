2006-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	Wespe		hi, umount keeps telling me that the device i want to umount is busy. what can I do?
2006-09-16T16:57:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	you're not trying to unmount it while cd'd to it or a subdirectory?
2006-09-16T16:58:00.000Z	Wespe	JosefK	no, and all apps but the console are closed
2006-09-16T16:58:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	cd to it, 'find . -exec fuser {} \;'
2006-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	if nothing shows there, you can always try a 'sudo umount -f *device*'
2006-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	Wespe	JosefK	it gives me .:                   10861c 13978c 14770c
2006-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	Wespe		./o:                  5730c  6149c 28219c  7491c  9317c
2006-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	Wespe		.:                   10861c 13978c 14770c
2006-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	Wespe		./o:                  5730c  6149c 28219c  7491c  9317c
2006-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	JosefK		that'll do :)
2006-09-16T05:00:00.000Z	Wespe		what does that mean?
2006-09-16T05:01:00.000Z	JosefK		they're process id's using the path/files.  presumably one of them will be your shell, and the find
2006-09-16T05:01:00.000Z	JosefK		'ps -ef | grep *process ID*' to figure if it's safe to 'kill *ID*' them
2006-09-16T05:02:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	it looks some things are still cd'd to it.  you should be safe to cd out of it, and kill those IDs.
2006-09-16T05:03:00.000Z	Wespe		flo       7491  6149  0 09:40 pts/3    00:00:00 xmms -p is hanging in there ;)
2006-09-16T05:03:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	there you go then ;)
2006-09-16T05:04:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	if xmms refuses to be killed, you can add -9 (kill immediately) ie. 'kill -9 7491'
2006-09-16T05:05:00.000Z	Wespe	JosefK	yeah, thx. won't umount altough... chacking the IDs again
2006-09-16T05:05:00.000Z	Wespe		checking
2006-09-16T05:05:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	remember to cd to ~ or something first
2006-09-16T05:06:00.000Z	Wespe	JosefK	i did ;)
2006-09-16T05:06:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	erk :/ probably some processes hanging in there
2006-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	Wespe	JosefK	anyway, I will try again after a restart... thx a lot
2006-09-16T05:08:00.000Z	JosefK	Wespe	np :)
