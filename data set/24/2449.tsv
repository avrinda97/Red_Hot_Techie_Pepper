2012-08-03T06:17:00.000Z	Platypus-Man		I have set up samba to share my drives (using Ubuntu as a NAS) and see my /home/user/ folder is shared on the network (can only browse, not change files) - how do I make it so that this folder is not shared? when I go to /home/ and right-click /user/ and view Sharing Options, the "Share this folder" option is unticked
2012-08-03T06:18:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	What?
2012-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	You've set up samba to share your drives?
2012-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	How do you make it so that *what* folder is not shared?
2012-08-03T06:20:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	well, not the drives directly... but the first folder in the drives are shared... but the problem is that /home/user/ is also shared, I don't want to share that
2012-08-03T06:20:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	What *do* you want to share?
2012-08-03T06:21:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	What do you mean "the first folder in the drives"?
2012-08-03T06:22:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	I do want to share my drives with media on, and have already done so, the problem is that my /home/ folder is also shared, and I don't want that
2012-08-03T06:22:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	Well, it appears that is exactly what you've shared.
2012-08-03T06:23:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	so to have any shared folder at all, I need to share my whole home directory?
2012-08-03T06:23:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	Ok then, just share what you want to and not what you don't want to.  NO, you do NOT have to share your whole home directory.
2012-08-03T06:24:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	again, I do _not_ want to share my home dir, but it is shared, and I am asking how to un-share it, since when I click on Sharing Options for the folder the sharing checkboxes are un-ticked
2012-08-03T06:25:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	First, you have to figure out exactly what you've done.  Well, back up and decide exactly what you *want* to do.  Make a directory that you want to share and then just share only that.
2012-08-03T06:27:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	pastebinit /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-08-03T06:28:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1126326/
2012-08-03T06:31:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	Yep, you shared your home folder.    Now, what do you really want to share?
2012-08-03T06:32:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	See lines 342-347 ?
2012-08-03T06:33:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	I only want to share the other drives connected to it, and I have done so successfully... thanks for your help
2012-08-03T06:33:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	Suggestion, create a folder, like maybe "Videos".  Then just share /home/platypus/Videos
2012-08-03T06:34:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	 What you did instead is to share your entire home directory.
2012-08-03T06:34:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	I'm running Ubuntu as a NAS, booting from a USB thumbdrive, and only share the 10 internal drives on it
2012-08-03T06:35:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	That is now what your smb.conf file says.
2012-08-03T06:37:00.000Z	Platypus-Man	usr13	removing and chanign a few lines in the conf resolved it, thanks
2012-08-03T06:37:00.000Z	usr13	Platypus-Man	Okeydokey
