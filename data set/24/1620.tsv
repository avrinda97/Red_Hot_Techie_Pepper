2010-08-13T21:41:00.000Z	bullhorn		i just got back into ubuntu
2010-08-13T21:41:00.000Z	bullhorn		im on my gsm modem, trying to figure how to connect with my ethernet cable modem
2010-08-13T21:42:00.000Z	bullhorn		i think it recognizes it as 'eth0' but i need to write some username and password... im not sure :X
2010-08-13T21:43:00.000Z	bullhorn		any ideas?
2010-08-13T21:43:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	Does your ISP use PPPoE?
2010-08-13T21:43:00.000Z	bullhorn		i am not sure about this
2010-08-13T21:44:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	can you give me the two methods than, for PPPoE enabled and disabled?
2010-08-13T21:45:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	"pppoeconf" in terminal will help you there if you have the details AndrewMC mentions
2010-08-13T21:46:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	 AndrewMC, can we try the without-PPPoE method first and if it fails, ill gtfo back to my windows xp and try to dig out the info..
2010-08-13T21:46:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	well first of all, do you get any kind of IP to your eth0 ?
2010-08-13T21:47:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	how do i check? im seriously new to this..
2010-08-13T21:47:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	open a terminal and type "ifconfig"
2010-08-13T21:47:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	it's a verbose version of the windows "ipconfig"
2010-08-13T21:49:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	i dont see an IP there... i do see some TX and RX data though
2010-08-13T21:50:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	no "inet xx.xx.xx.xx" info?
2010-08-13T21:50:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	this is the closest to that, but no:
2010-08-13T21:50:00.000Z	bullhorn		eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1b:38:70:e8:4f
2010-08-13T21:50:00.000Z	bullhorn		          inet6 addr: fe80::21b:38ff:fe70:e84f/64 Scope:Link
2010-08-13T21:51:00.000Z	bullhorn		got it
2010-08-13T21:51:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	ah k, IPv6.
2010-08-13T21:51:00.000Z	bullhorn		it isnt supposed to be ipv6 afaik... :/
2010-08-13T21:51:00.000Z	bullhorn		its a crappy 2.5mbit cable connection
2010-08-13T21:53:00.000Z	mrb_	bullhorn	what happens if you just open up a webbrowser (without any other NICs connected), are you taken to a login page? Otherwise I would look at finding the details of the ISP config/plan to see if it's PPPoE
2010-08-13T21:53:00.000Z	bullhorn	mrb_	nothing happens, it keeps trying to connect
