2011-01-02T06:39:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		I figured it out
2011-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		Damn firefox wasn't showing the download!
2011-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		>_<
2011-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		It was downloading... I'm sorry.
2011-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		generally Firefox pops up with a window showing a download is running.
2011-01-02T06:40:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		In this case, it didn't.
2011-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		And actually I had an older version of the USB installer I was running
2011-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		so now I'm downloading version 10.10
2011-01-02T06:41:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		On the newer download.
2011-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		What's unetbootin?
2011-01-02T06:42:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	It's a program that helps you put an ISO onto a USB drive
2011-01-02T06:43:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	there are lots of programs that do that, it probably doesn't matter which you use
2011-01-02T06:50:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	tsrk	- Does Bell South even exist anymore?
2011-01-02T06:50:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	No idea, but some of my customers seem to have email addresses from them and some of the emails are getting bounced. I want to see if their servers are rejecting my mail.
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	I think it's part of AT&T or something
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	tsrk	- weird.
2011-01-02T06:51:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	Yeah, email servers are a PITA
2011-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	I'd say you found a bad mirror
2011-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	if you refresh the DL page you'll get a different mirror
2011-01-02T06:55:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	I'm getting 1MB/s from here: http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/ubuntu-releases/
2011-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	and also U of Waterloo is awesome so you should always use their mirrors ;)
2011-01-02T06:56:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	tsrk	- Thanks.
2011-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	tsrk	- it was running at about the same rate the previous one was, so I'll use the torrent.
2011-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	tsrk	Da_Rhyno	ok, torrent will probably be the fastest option
