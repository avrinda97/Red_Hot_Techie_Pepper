2008-03-03T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	if you have a question, ask it.
2008-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	my logitech g5 does not work at all, with any 3d game aplication, is this a known problem?
2008-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	i have no idea... don't even know what a logitech g5 is
2008-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	logitech g5 is a usb mouse
2008-03-03T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	the mouse doesn'tt work at all, or just extra buttons, etc, dont work?
2008-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	thats kinda weird, is it hooked up to a USB port, or do you have it going to a PS2 port w/ an adapter?
2008-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	i have it in the USB port
2008-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	maybe shutdown, and try putting it in the PS2 port w/ an adapter?..
2008-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	I have tried that as well
2008-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	then sorry, i have no logical suggestion
2008-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	no worries, I thank you for your time, I am going to reinstal 6.10
2008-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	not erally sure thats the answer
2008-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	are you stil there?
2008-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	the same mouse works perfect, in 6.10. I just wanted to try out 7.10
2008-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	try googling, "Logitech G5 Ubuntu 7.10", i got several hits, this suggests this si not an isolated problem
2008-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	dohhhh, now i feel like an idiot. LOL  I didn't even think to google it. ROFL
2008-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	it happens
2008-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	wow, allot of editing for a mouse, I am going to go back to 6.10, not worth anymore headache. I have been fighting it two days. :-)
2008-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	seems strange it works under Edgy, but not Gutsy.
2008-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	I hear ya there, doesn't make any sense to me either. I wasnt unhappy with 6.10 at all, just wanted to try 7.10
2008-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	maybe install 6.10, upgrade to 7.04, then upgrade to 7.10
2008-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	blaster	IndyGunFreak	possible that would work, but again, i liked 6.10, so no need to fix what isn't broke. :-)
2008-03-03T07:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blaster	true, other than it will be obsolete here soon
