2006-07-14T09:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	somewhat of a taboo over there?
2006-07-14T09:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	the module is not in repos, that's the problem.
2006-07-14T09:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	ah, bummer
2006-07-14T09:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	first place I looked ;)
2006-07-29T11:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	it appears to not be listening
2006-07-29T11:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	what have you all tried?
2006-07-29T11:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	of significance?  just dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.0
2006-07-29T11:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	confirming no listener, postinsts of other pacakges get no answer when trying to create a db
2006-07-29T11:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	confirming no listener, telnet localhost 6543
2006-07-29T11:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19142
2006-07-29T11:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	it *seems* as though he does not have aoot user or password in mysql
2006-07-29T11:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	hence no ability to freate users or dbs for packages
2006-07-29T11:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	that's the normal setup, there is no correlation between the root user of the system and the root user of mysql.
2006-07-29T11:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	agreed
2006-08-22T15:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	i think custom stuff called "launchpad" now :)  it's a recent thing that it was all-custom
2006-08-22T15:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	all FOSS though, to their pride :)  i'm sure there has to be a d/l link, though i've not seen it
2006-08-22T15:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	would like to see the magic behind that thing.
2006-08-22T15:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	i saw an annoucement about it recently, but i think there is, let me check.  sec...
2006-08-22T15:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	#launchpad has 53 in it :)  they'd know
2006-08-22T15:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	got my answer from the ... faq :)
2006-08-22T15:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	a download link there too?
2006-08-22T15:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	eyequeue	I wish, but I got the info I was after. Its a zope app.
2006-08-22T15:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	ah
2006-08-25T14:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	fyrestrtr	gdebi?
