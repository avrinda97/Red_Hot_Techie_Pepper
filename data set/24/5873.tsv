2006-05-06T06:39:00.000Z	zivak		ok - i just followed instruction under "Resolution is not delivered by the vBios" section... it doesn't work :|
2006-05-06T06:39:00.000Z	zivak		this is a very stubborn problem
2006-05-06T06:41:00.000Z	zivak		is anybody else willing to go thru with me step by step via PM?
2006-05-06T06:42:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	can't get a higher screen res.?
2006-05-06T06:42:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- nope.... the only way i can get to desktop is using VESA
2006-05-06T06:43:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	what video card do you have?
2006-05-06T06:43:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- I'm using Intel Graphic Media Accelerator 950 (HP DV1000t laptop)
2006-05-06T06:44:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	what was the original driver xorg set?
2006-05-06T06:45:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- it picked i810
2006-05-06T06:46:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	what happens when you used that one?
2006-05-06T06:47:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- the error says "failed to start x server (your graphical interface)" so i had to use VESA to get to desktop
2006-05-06T06:49:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	*nod* i couldn'tuse the ati driver on this card, whereas fglrx works fine.  maybe pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log when it fails
2006-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	either that or search the forum for your card/ the driver
2006-05-06T06:50:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- i did.. tried 915resolution... won't work the way i want
2006-05-06T06:54:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	i'm not familiar w/ 915.  did you try reconfigging xorg w/ the i810 driver?
2006-05-06T06:54:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- how do i reconfigure i810 driver?
2006-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ... go through the steps, press default if you don't know what to enter, but choose the i810 driver when prompted
2006-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- i picked i810 and that's what causing the error. failed to start x server
2006-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	so you already ran the reconfig command?
2006-05-06T06:57:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- yup
2006-05-06T07:39:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	i thought your problem was that you were forced to use vesa :-/
2006-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	course it is.  vesa only provides software rendering iirc
2006-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	orbin	zivak	you want ff1.5?
2006-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	zivak	orbin	- yup
