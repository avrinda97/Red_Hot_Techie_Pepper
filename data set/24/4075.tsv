2007-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	aaron	AboSamoor	try this. open your terminal... and run vncviewer
2007-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	can you give me your IP ? you can set VNC in the view mode to be secure. my friend is sleeping
2007-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	aaron		I don't have anything set up.
2007-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	aaron	AboSamoor	are you sure you have vncviewer installed?
2007-08-12T05:13:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	yes, and after i entered that command a dialog box appeared
2007-08-12T05:13:00.000Z	aaron	AboSamoor	if you share the IP you're trying to connect to i can verify that port 5900 is open.
2007-08-12T05:13:00.000Z	aaron		or you can, using nmap. if you're familiar.
2007-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	, sorry. but i can't understand you very well. what do you want me to do ?
2007-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	do you want my IP address ?
2007-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	aaron	AboSamoor	i want the ip that you are trying to connect to.
2007-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	aaron	AboSamoor	it sounds like the server isn't setup properly.
2007-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	AboSamoor		but his PC is off.
2007-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	but his PC is off.

2007-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	AboSamoor	aaron	86.108.46.12
