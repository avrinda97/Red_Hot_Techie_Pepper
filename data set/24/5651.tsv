2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	AJ004		i cant believe google........ they are finally moving over to linux
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	AJ004		about time
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	AJ004		when the next linux distros come out after the google summer of code 2006
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	AJ004		linux is gonna overtake microsoft
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	AJ004		for the first time :)
2006-06-13T05:52:00.000Z	AJ004		which should be fixed by the next release
2006-06-13T05:53:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	legal problems, patents
2006-06-13T05:53:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 All we need is a slightly commercial linux distro or some hackers who make it free even if it has patents
2006-06-13T05:54:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 maybe google could subsidize it for free as well
2006-06-13T05:54:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	some hackers made it: mplayer
2006-06-13T05:54:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	thats a possibility... google could buy the patents and give em back to linux
2006-06-13T05:54:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 I have the easyubuntu package and it still wont run formats correctly
2006-06-13T05:54:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 It installed all the players and codecs too
2006-06-13T05:55:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	is there something else i need?
2006-06-13T05:55:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	compile the software by your self
2006-06-13T05:56:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	the "hackers who make it free even if it has patents" make the code but ubuntu don't ship it
2006-06-13T05:56:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 Like if I watched marissa mayer's video (she works for google....) it wont work on linux
2006-06-13T05:58:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	the buy patents for free software: http://www.openinventionnetwork.com
2006-06-13T06:00:00.000Z	AJ004	kmilo	 i think eventually linux will have no patent issues cause cant google or a big firm just license the patents and give em back free to linux
2006-06-13T06:04:00.000Z	kmilo	AJ004	the Penguin Liberation Front make packages for patent trouble applications
