2008-03-09T03:41:00.000Z	soundray	arooni	it should work. Make sure the guest system has focus while you plug it in.
2008-03-09T03:42:00.000Z	arooni	soundray	i've tried plugging it in every usb port i have and it doesnt show up in lsusb or vbox
2008-03-09T03:42:00.000Z	soundray	arooni	maybe your host system captures it and isolates it from the guest
2008-03-09T03:43:00.000Z	arooni	soundray	how can i stop that
2008-03-09T03:43:00.000Z	soundray	arooni	vbox settings? Unfortunately I don't know anything about those.
