2010-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	gMinuses		my jack sense (plugging in a headset in the jack mutes the speakers) doesn't work in ubuntu (both have sound come out), but it works in windows. is there any way I can fix it?
2010-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	file a bug
2010-10-25T07:46:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	ubuntu-bug -s audio
2010-10-25T07:47:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	I did that, but dev team said it's my motherboard and flag the problem invalid, and I said it works in windows. They said they will look into it and still leave the problem as invalid. I don't know what to do now.
2010-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	"dev team"? which person
2010-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	wait a second, let me see.
2010-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	(hi, i'm one of the developers)
2010-10-25T07:49:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	OMG, really? that's awesome. hope you can help me fix it this time. let me find the ticket for you.
2010-10-25T07:50:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	audio's not my usual area, but...a lot of the bug triagers arent actually developers, so i want to look at the bug report
2010-10-25T07:53:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	I can't seem to find the bug in my bugs section. is it because they flag it as invalid? where can I find it?
2010-10-25T07:53:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	yes, use the advanced search
2010-10-25T07:54:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	here is it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/643745
2010-10-25T07:57:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	btw, I also installed ubuntu 10.10 and the jack sense still doesn't work, if that helps.
2010-10-25T07:59:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	oh. what luke said makes sense.  desktops arent supposed to mute on headphone plugin, just laptops
2010-10-25T07:59:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	is that so? but why windows can support jack sense for my MB?
2010-10-25T08:00:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	its not a lack of detection. its behaviour
2010-10-25T08:00:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	windows is deciding to mute it (for some reason... my win95 and winxp desktops didnt do that...)
2010-10-25T08:01:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	so it's not possible to have jack sense for my computer under ubuntu? is there any way I can make it behave like windows?
2010-10-25T08:03:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	i dont know any automatic settings for that... maybe somewhere in pulseaudio?
2010-10-25T08:04:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	is my ubuntu using alsa right now? how do i switch it to  pulse?
2010-10-25T08:04:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	pulse is installed by default. its an audio server on top of alsa (alsa being the driver)
2010-10-25T08:05:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	thank for the info. i'm a linux n00b. :). where do I tweak its settings?
2010-10-25T08:06:00.000Z	maco	gMinuses	system -> preferences -> sound and you can install pavucontrol for extra control over devices
2010-10-25T08:06:00.000Z	gMinuses	maco	thanks. I will try that.
