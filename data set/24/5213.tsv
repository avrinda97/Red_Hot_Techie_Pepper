2007-07-08T13:29:00.000Z	stefg	head	desktop install basically just copies an image, no way to influence certain packages. you'd need an expert install from an alternate CD
2007-07-08T13:29:00.000Z	head	stefg	the installation process is finished. to be more detailed... we have a feisty server edition and try to install e.g postfix
2007-07-08T13:30:00.000Z	stefg	head	so you're complaining that there are certain dependencies?
2007-07-08T13:31:00.000Z	head	stefg	exactely
2007-07-08T13:32:00.000Z	stefg	head	that's design decisison. (and usually a wise one). what do you think is 'unnecessary' in particular?
2007-07-08T13:33:00.000Z	head	stefg	for example aptitude install postfix tells me that packages like x11-common xaw3dg xcursorgen xfonts-encodings xfonts-utils xlhtml xpdf-common xpdf-utils xutils xutils-dev etc. will be automatically installed... but I'm working without X just a cli based server
2007-07-08T13:34:00.000Z	head	stefg	so why would i possibly need xpdf :)
2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	stefg	head	there's probably some gui configuration-tool that draws a complete X11 install... not to familiar with postfix, but there might be component packages.
2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	head	stefg	what are component packages?
2007-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	stefg	head	the opposite of metapackages :-)
2007-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	head	stefg	:)
2007-07-08T13:37:00.000Z	head	stefg	ok last attempt *g* how is it possible to block packages that i do not want to be installed when installing something
2007-07-08T13:39:00.000Z	stefg	head	this would involve 'force -options for dpkg... don't do that, won't make you happy. you going to fight against apt all the time
2007-07-08T13:40:00.000Z	head	stefg	ok thanks for your effort... i will postpone the installation until i figure it out
2007-07-08T13:42:00.000Z	stefg	head	but afaics postfix isn't dependent on anything X11 (says synaptic). Sure it's postfix that tries to draw all that stuff ?
2007-07-08T13:43:00.000Z	head	stefg	yes i am... i only do aptitude install postfix...nothing else... god, i miss use flags :)
2007-07-08T13:45:00.000Z	head	stefg	kitche: the following is part of the packages that will be installed if i proceed. --> The following NEW packages will be installed: ca-certificates cpp cpp-4.1 defoma emacs21 emacs21-bin-common emacs21-common emacsen-common file gsfonts gsfonts-x11 hyperestraier libestraier8 libfcgi0c2
2007-07-08T13:45:00.000Z	stefg	head	emacs ???
2007-07-08T13:47:00.000Z	head	stefg	yes, do you understand why i don't get it :)
2007-07-08T13:47:00.000Z	stefg	head	there must be something wrong elsewhere
2007-07-08T13:48:00.000Z	head	stefg	thats the thing, because if i try to install postfix with apt-get the only packages that are installed are openssl postfix ssl-cert
2007-07-08T13:52:00.000Z	head	stefg	kitche: thanks for you help....
