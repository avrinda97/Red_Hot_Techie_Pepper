2006-05-23T05:07:00.000Z	Stormx2		Im so tired
2006-05-23T05:08:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	they get a chan #lesser-ubuntu
2006-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	why not kde?
2006-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	Read up ^
2006-05-23T05:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	"Don't question my package management biatch" <-- what are you going to do if you decide you didn't quite ike that kde?
2006-05-23T05:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	Uninstall qt3 like I did last time?
2006-05-23T05:14:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	that's gonna get you rid all the packages.
2006-05-23T05:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	It won't remove it's dependancies though.
2006-05-23T05:14:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	it will.
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	Imagine if a trivial package depended on libc and aptitude uninstalled that. That would be silly
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	trivial?
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	non-essential.
2006-05-23T05:16:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	well anyways, if you decide to remove kde you probably want all of it gone and aptitude pretty much does just that.
2006-05-23T05:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	Samuli^	So does apt-get remove qt3
2006-05-23T05:16:00.000Z	Samuli^	Stormx2	it doesn't. there's still all kde-packages that don't depend on qt3 left.
