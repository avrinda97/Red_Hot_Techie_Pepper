2008-11-11T12:52:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	try the test buttons to ensure your sound is working (from preferences -> sound)
2008-11-11T12:52:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	 cant find the test buttons under sound
2008-11-11T12:53:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	if you open preferences->sound, you sound have a devices tab where you select the driver, beside each selection is a test button

2008-11-11T12:55:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	if you open preferences->sound, you sound have a devices tab where you select the driver, beside each selection is a test button
2008-11-11T12:56:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	ok i'm at the test buttons, what do i do now? click on test and then what?
2008-11-11T12:56:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	see if you have sound correctly
2008-11-11T12:57:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	it should make a sound
2008-11-11T12:58:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	ok it worked, i switched everything to ALSA
2008-11-11T12:59:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	amarok isn't playing the file
2008-11-11T12:59:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	i havent tried amarok, but you may be able to set sound options in it's preferences
2008-11-11T13:01:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	take a look at these links
2008-11-11T13:01:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	what do i do now? i switched everything to alsa and used the testers and wheni play the mp3 no sounds comes out
2008-11-11T13:02:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	im out of suggestions
2008-11-11T13:02:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	i've already got the extended extras i think
2008-11-11T13:02:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	joebodo	is there a way of double checking though? that i've them enabled
2008-11-11T13:04:00.000Z	joebodo	CostaRicanQuaker	from what i can tell, your setup seems good - you can check in administration -> synaptics package manager to see if that package is installed
