2008-11-30T20:54:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	thanks!
2008-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	can u give me a hand
2008-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	sure, I can try
2008-12-02T07:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	If it's the sound issue, I can't help, I don't use sound
2008-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	have you done any kernel updates since the last time you rebooted? I;ve seen some folks saying that the last kernel upgrade messed with sound somehow
2008-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	as a matter of fact, I did an update from the updater that appears in the top, sound WAS working, then I rebooted tonight and boom no sound
2008-12-02T07:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	sounds like the new kernel messed with your sound. I can't help but that info will help you narrow the problem down
2008-12-02T07:16:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	how do i check to see if i have the latest video card drivers
2008-12-02T07:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	update the system (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade) and you'll have the latest of stuff from the repos.
2008-12-02T07:18:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	its all up to date
2008-12-02T07:18:00.000Z	MrCollins	ardchoille	how do I check to see if I am using 3d acceleration in my games like open arena etc?
2008-12-02T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	MrCollins	then you have the latest of your software from the repos, can't get any more up to date than that
