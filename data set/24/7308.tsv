2007-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	robert_		has the latest version of OpenOffice.org ever made anybody's X take a permanent vacation?
2007-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	i have been having an issue with openoffice
2007-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	i thought it was just some setting i had
2007-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	robert_		hm
2007-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	robert_		so it isn't just me
2007-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	can you describe your experience(s) more?
2007-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	robert_	deshantm	my problem happens whenever you try to pull down a menu
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	robert_		it forces me to restart it
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	robert_		er
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	every time? or just once in awhile?
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	robert_		every time
2007-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	i have only had that happen once in awhile
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	it doesn't fully lock the computer... i.e. i can't get in via ssh, but even then it doesn't let me kill X or openoffice etc.
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	robert_	deshantm	hm, calling X a hippie and 'killall -9 Xorg' from console solves it for me
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	robert_		console being ssh
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	robert_		ah
2007-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	robert_		is ssh running on your box?
2007-08-10T09:25:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	yes i have an ssh server running on it
2007-08-10T09:25:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	i never tried the kill -9 for xorg
2007-08-10T09:25:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	i usually just tried doing gdm stop
2007-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	how much RAM on your system... does that seem to be an possible issue... low memory?
2007-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	robert_	deshantm	I dunno, does 3gb often cause a problem with OpenOffice?
2007-08-10T09:30:00.000Z	deshantm	robert_	that is what i have... obviously it shouldn't be a problem... but with firefox agressively caching. etc
