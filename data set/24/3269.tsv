2008-09-26T17:16:00.000Z	dishayu	arvind_khadri	: ï»¿i need to reinstall grub... i added a new HDD and made some modifications to the non-linux partitions of the old one using partition magic in windows... now i'm unable to boot... it gives error 17... i am booted from hardy live cd... please help...  "sudo grub-install /dev/sda1" gives an error "Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device."
2008-09-26T17:17:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	dishayu	you can re-install grub like that... and afaik error 17 is not recoverable
2008-09-26T17:18:00.000Z	dishayu	arvind_khadri	: will reinstalling ubuntu help? i don't have much any data on my linux drives...
2008-09-26T17:19:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	dishayu	yeah that will do... but just try re-installing grub once
2008-09-26T17:20:00.000Z	dishayu	arvind_khadri	: i tried everything google could give me, but reinstalling grub seems like impossible right now, so i guess i'd just reinstall ubuntu, since error 17 is not recoverable...
