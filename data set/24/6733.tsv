2007-04-30T08:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		so theres no way to get the data off the dvd-rw without vista?
2007-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	can you not mount them manually?
2007-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	i don't know how to do that can you assist me
2007-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	try opening them with k3b, it should at least tell you the kind of data contained within
2007-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	open a terminal and type sudo -i
2007-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	from there type mount /dev/dvd /mnt
2007-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	then type ls /mnt
2007-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	i love you man...it worked flawlessly its mounted read only but i don't care ^_^
2007-04-30T08:54:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	good job
2007-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	not vista then ;)
2007-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	it's a really sad os...i feel bad for the people that got stuck with it on there dell's and don't know what to do about windows ME II
2007-04-30T09:06:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	ok i put the next disk in but it still shows the files from the previous disk?
2007-04-30T09:06:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	you will have to run umount /mnt
2007-04-30T09:06:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	then run the other command again with the new disk in
2007-04-30T09:07:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	really, the disks should be mounted automatically when you insert them in ubuntu
2007-04-30T09:07:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	for future reference, there is a nice panel applet that you can add to the the gnome-panel by right clicking it and selecting "add to panel", from there select the disk mounter applet and hit add
2007-04-30T09:08:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	what is the app called?
2007-04-30T09:08:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	disk mounter
2007-04-30T09:09:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	it's in the "add to panel" menu
2007-04-30T09:12:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	it's not showing the disk icon in the bar O-o
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	did you get the disk mounter working?
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	cute_bettong	variant	for some reason the little app isen't showing up not sure why
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	variant	cute_bettong	odd
