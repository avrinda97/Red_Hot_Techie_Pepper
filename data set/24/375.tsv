2012-04-09T15:03:00.000Z	wonderman	kcin	yes, not perfect though
2012-04-09T15:04:00.000Z	kcin	wonderman	how much not perfect? ^_^
2012-04-09T15:04:00.000Z	wonderman		pretty perfect
2012-04-09T15:04:00.000Z	wonderman		but i get issues upgrading kernels
2012-04-09T15:04:00.000Z	wonderman		seems i have to reinstall ATI drivers after this, and ubuntu yet to respond with reasons as to why
2012-04-09T15:05:00.000Z	kcin	wonderman	ahhh, but it's still usable right, just need a little work?
2012-04-09T15:05:00.000Z	wonderman		also depends i guess on how you install the ATI drivers
2012-04-09T15:05:00.000Z	wonderman		you probably should generate distro packages, but i had issues this way so left the isntaller to it
2012-04-09T15:05:00.000Z	wonderman		yes its fine
2012-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	kcin	wonderman	cool, I'll try my luck :)
2012-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	wonderman		think latest are like 12.3 or something now ?
2012-04-09T15:06:00.000Z	kcin		yeah, it's 12.3
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	wonderman		just run the install script
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	wonderman		but run
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	wonderman		aticonfig -f initial
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	wonderman		i think thast the command
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	wonderman		before you reboot
2012-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	kcin		noted
2012-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	wonderman		kcin:
2012-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	wonderman		aticonfig --initial -f
2012-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	wonderman		root has to do this also
2012-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	wonderman		so use sudo
2012-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	kcin	wonderman	thanks
