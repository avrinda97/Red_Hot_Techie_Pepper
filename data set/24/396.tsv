2011-10-08T13:32:00.000Z	Ben64		have you run fsck on the partition
2011-10-08T13:32:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	how would I do that without being able to boot in?
2011-10-08T13:33:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	even the live CD of a previous version, right?
2011-10-08T13:36:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	can you clarify?
2011-10-08T13:37:00.000Z	Ben64	mtnman80	if its formatted ext, check it with fsck in ubuntu livecd, if its ntfs, check it with chkdsk in windows install cd
2011-10-08T13:38:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	I think I'm going to at least try that ... to hold on tight here a sec ...
2011-10-08T13:54:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	ok.  here's the plan.  for some reason, this time when I booted up, it did so normally into Ubuntu.  Strange.  This time I was running a living CD .... and it booted instead off the hard drive into 11.04 as normal.  My BIOS is currently set to boot primarily off the hard drive.
2011-10-08T13:56:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	... so I am going to run fsck and see what the results are.  I will also try "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get upgrade" to make sure I have the most up to date version of the kernel.  I am also going to check to see if all the files on the home match what is on my USB drives ... in case none of this works .... and what "ikonia" has said is true in that my hardware is failing .. which in that case ... my computer is D
2011-10-08T13:57:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	i,.e. perform any necessary backups ... as you just stated ...;
2011-10-08T14:01:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	ok.  the result of "fsck" was that /dev/sdb1 was mounted.  It tells me that if I continue with the disc check, I will cause severe system damage. Should I proceed anyway ... or will I really cause severe system damage?
2011-10-08T14:02:00.000Z	Ben64	mtnman80	you should not fsck a mounted filesystem, thats asking for trouble
2011-10-08T14:02:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	or do I need to run a command in terminal to unmount /dev/sbd1.  Isn't that referring to the USB flash drive?
2011-10-08T14:03:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	No, I am not booting off it currently.  It booted straight off the hard drive this time.  So /dev/sdb1 refers to the hard drive?  I am confused.  Isn't there a command that you can run to check "what is what", I thought?
2011-10-08T14:04:00.000Z	Ben64	mtnman80	if you do "mount" on the command line, you will see where everything is mounted
2011-10-08T14:06:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	ran "sudo fdisk -l" as "theadmin" instructed.  /dev/sdb1 is indeed the main Linus OS.  /dev/sdb2 shows as the "extended" system.  /dev/sdb5 shows as the Linux swap / Solaris.
2011-10-08T14:09:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	where should "/dev/sbd1" be mounted?  I just ran "mount", so I can tell you what it says ...
2011-10-08T14:10:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	it says it is on "/type ext4".  I don't really know what that means, but ...
2011-10-08T14:10:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	so like ... is my OS mounted incorrectly.  Is that the whole problem?  Or is it still something else?
2011-10-08T14:11:00.000Z	Ben64	mtnman80	"on / type ext4" means its the main linux partition
2011-10-08T14:12:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	 yeah.  so no problem there.  should I still run fsck on it, then ... or not?  We need to check the disk.  I should probably take the instructions given by "theadmin" to do fsck on the root filesystem ...
2011-10-08T14:12:00.000Z	Ben64	mtnman80	i'm still confused, is it booting off the "bad" disk? or the external usb one? is there an internal one at all?
2011-10-08T14:13:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	it's booting off the hard drive, which apparently is what "ikonia" said was failing ...
2011-10-08T14:14:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	it's booting off "IDE HDD0", which is the hard drive ... right?
2011-10-08T14:14:00.000Z	mtnman80	Ben64	that is what is set as #1 currently in the boot order in BIOS ...
