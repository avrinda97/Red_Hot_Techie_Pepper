2006-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	christopher_		hey who used FLUX in here?
2006-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	christopher_		whats the root pw to set up the GDM?
2006-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	On Ubuntu, the root account is locked by default. So when prompted for a password, use your regular user password
2006-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	im using FLUX
2006-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	i tried my regular pw and it didnt work
2006-02-21T17:13:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Yes, but gdm starts _before_ your desktop environment does. So it doesn't matter what DE you're using--just run 'gksudo gdmsetup' from the command line or choose System -> Administration -> Login
2006-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
2006-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	It's in your GNOME menu (if you're using GNOME)
2006-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	If you're _not_ using, GNOME, you can still invoke it from the command line with 'gksudo shares-admin'
2006-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Oh hang on--you're using Fluxbox?
2006-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	yeah
2006-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Meeh. Run 'gksudo shares-admin' from a terminal then
2006-02-21T17:23:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Depends on your GUI philosophy, really.  ;-)  If you're a bells-and-whistles kind of guy, you're better off with KDE.  If you just want to get common and simple stuff done, GNOME
2006-02-21T17:26:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	im a newbie but my goal is to do everything i did in windows with more stability and to learn
2006-02-21T17:29:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	what about flux comparing to GNOME? which one is more for newbies and which one more for ppl wanting to learn to do more?
2006-02-21T17:29:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	GNOME is definitely oriented towards novices and newbies who just want to get stuff done. I'd say environments like Fluxbox and Openbox are for more advanced users who want the GUI to stay out of the way
2006-02-21T17:32:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	my intentions is to be able to not need a GUI and to use the best, quickest, most stable way of using a computer system
2006-02-21T17:37:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	If you're running GNOME, you'd go to System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
2006-02-21T17:38:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	FLUX user here
2006-02-21T17:38:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	But since you're the enterprising Fluxbox user, we assume you want to do things the expert way
2006-02-21T17:38:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	yes sir want to learn the whole programming world
2006-02-21T17:39:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Then drop into #fluxbox. ;-)
2006-02-21T17:41:00.000Z	christopher_	nailbiter	how do i connect to that?
2006-02-21T17:41:00.000Z	nailbiter	christopher_	Type '/j #fluxbox' into your IRC client
