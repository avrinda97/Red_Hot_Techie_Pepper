2011-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	corrytonapple		HomePeachesAndcre:  No, it should be 64-bit
2011-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	HotPeachesAndcre	corrytonapple	how do i make is 64bit
2011-05-17T06:44:00.000Z	corrytonapple	HotPeachesAndcre	 You will have to burn a new disc/usb installer and reinstall Ubuntu to your system.
2011-05-17T06:45:00.000Z	corrytonapple	HotPeachesAndcre	 But you have to download the 64-bit version from the Ubuntu site this tinme
2011-05-17T06:45:00.000Z	corrytonapple		*time
2011-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	corrytonapple	HotPeachesAndcre	 64-bit is made so it can use over 4Gb of RAM, also known as memory
2011-05-17T06:47:00.000Z	HotPeachesAndcre	corrytonapple	thank you but i don`t want to lose it install  and download all that stuff again, i think i will keep this version as its safe and secure :)
2011-05-17T06:48:00.000Z	corrytonapple	HotPeachesAndcre	 It is just as safe and secure either way, but if you do not want to go through that trouble right now that is fine.  I understand.
2011-05-17T06:50:00.000Z	corrytonapple	HotPeachesAndcre	 But, since you have a new install, and do not want to loose your documents, I would do it now, or as know, now or never!  If you ever want to, join the Ubuntu Forums at ubuntuforums.org, start a thread, PM me (I am corrytonapple there too) and I will come to the thread and help, as all the other users in the forum will too
2011-05-17T06:50:00.000Z	HotPeachesAndcre	corrytonapple	thank you x
