2007-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	rockets		None of my apps will go fullscreen. Whenever I try to make vlc or totem or whatever go fullscreen, it appears in a window that extends only to the edge of my panel. and it has window borders and everything
2007-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	rockets		Any idea why that might be?
2007-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	do you have XVideo extension in your xorg.conf
2007-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	Should it be enabled or disabled?
2007-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	Should I turn Xvideo on or off?
2007-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	it should be loaded
2007-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	ill check
2007-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	its not loaded
2007-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	under modules just put Load "Xvideo" ?
2007-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	you could also try changing the output device for vlc
2007-08-10T08:07:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	its still not working. loaded xvideo and set vlc to use it
2007-08-10T08:08:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	are you running beryl or something lame like that?
2007-08-10T08:08:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	nope. im using fglrx but no beryl or xgl. and it always worked before
2007-08-10T08:11:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	 I don't get it. Fullscreen always worked before. I'm not using Xgl now for sure.
2007-08-10T08:11:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	try rm ~/.vlc
2007-08-10T08:12:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	yes but this happens in totem too
2007-08-10T08:12:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	what changes did you make, if any, before this problem occured?
2007-08-10T08:12:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	none that i know of!
2007-08-10T08:16:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	hey totem works now that i set it back to totem-gstreamer instead of totem-xine.
2007-08-10T08:17:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	but vlc doesnt work still
2007-08-10T08:17:00.000Z	winndixie	rockets	try deleting the ~/.vlc
2007-08-10T08:17:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	did that
2007-08-10T08:21:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	I got it.
2007-08-10T08:21:00.000Z	rockets	winndixie	Default option was to let the windowmanager handle fullscreening. Disabled that and let vlc handle it. works fine now
