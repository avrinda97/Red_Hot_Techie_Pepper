2006-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	j2daosh		hey aoupi, what is the format for adding a second ServerRoot option to my apache conf?
2006-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	I don't know, didn't even know it was possible :)
2006-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	j2daosh		or rather, how can i jail webusers to a different directory other then /www/data?
2006-11-01T09:26:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	j2daosh have a look in the vhosts
2006-11-01T09:26:00.000Z	j2daosh		rgr
2006-11-01T09:26:00.000Z	j2daosh		no vhost file
2006-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	j2daosh		well i got 2 .so and .load
2006-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	j2daosh		neither of which im qualified to touch :P
2006-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	you don't have a vhosts.d directory?
2006-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	j2daosh		nope
2006-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	I see, gentoo and ubuntu differs in the apache conf then
2006-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	go into the directory with httpd.conf then: grep DocumentRoot *
2006-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	j2daosh		yeah, gentoo is more of a "compile it yourself since you think your so special" distro :P
2006-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	DocumentRoot is what you want to change. that's gentoo in a nutshell :)
2006-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	j2daosh		ok ill have to add a line... there isn't one in the http.conf file
2006-11-01T09:30:00.000Z	j2daosh		well adding the line didn't work
2006-11-01T09:31:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	in /etc/apache2 is there only an httpd.conf file or are there more stuff in there?
2006-11-01T09:31:00.000Z	j2daosh		there is apache2.conf / httpd.conf / ports.conf
2006-11-01T09:32:00.000Z	j2daosh	rebeca	with what?
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	see if there already is any DocumentRoot in any of thoose files
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	j2daosh		mope
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	j2daosh		nope
2006-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	are you sure thoose are all that is in /etc/apache2? no other directories?
2006-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	aoupi	j2daosh	and since you change Listen in httpd.conf, I suggest you change it in ports.conf instead seems like that is the way ubuntu wants it
