2010-01-06T09:57:00.000Z	tawd		ilmatic glad you like it :)
2010-01-06T09:57:00.000Z	militant	tawd	ok, what i'd prefer to do is set vlc as default for all media types... and i did, in Preferred Applications.  but it doesn't seem to pay any attention to that
2010-01-06T10:00:00.000Z	tawd		militant im not sure you could probably google that to find how to set vlc as default
2010-01-06T10:00:00.000Z	militant	tawd	i did, and the instructions it gives make no sense.  yes there's an 'open with' on the right click menu but no button or box to set the selected app as default.  *shrug*
2010-01-06T10:01:00.000Z	tawd		militant i'll brb.  going to google to try to help :)
2010-01-06T10:01:00.000Z	militant	tawd	thanks!  the instructions i found were on an ubuntu site, so ... i dunno
2010-01-06T10:06:00.000Z	tawd		ilmatic download ccsm
2010-01-06T10:09:00.000Z	tawd	militant	you said that you had changed vlc to be default in System > Preferences > Preferred Applications?
2010-01-06T10:09:00.000Z	militant	tawd	yessir
2010-01-06T10:09:00.000Z	tawd	militant	let me see something else real quick, sorry, i'm on dial-up internet at the moment
2010-01-06T10:10:00.000Z	militant	tawd	appreciate the help
2010-01-06T10:12:00.000Z	tawd		militant did you go to a terminal and type cp '/usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop' '/usr/share/applications/totem.desktop'   ?
2010-01-06T10:12:00.000Z	militant	tawd	no, lemme do that
2010-01-06T10:12:00.000Z	tawd		militant ok, i hope it works
2010-01-06T10:13:00.000Z	tawd		militant wait
2010-01-06T10:13:00.000Z	tawd		militant probably make a backup of that file before copying over it
2010-01-06T10:13:00.000Z	militant		alrady did, one sec
2010-01-06T10:14:00.000Z	tawd		militant do  cp /usr/share/applications/totem.desktop /usr/share/applications/tote.desktop.copy
2010-01-06T10:14:00.000Z	tawd		then do the first comand
2010-01-06T10:15:00.000Z	tawd		militant sorry the second one has a typo it should be /usr/share/applications/tote.desktop.copy
2010-01-06T10:15:00.000Z	tawd		militant sorry the second one has a typo it should be /usr/share/applications/totem.desktop.copy
2010-01-06T10:16:00.000Z	tawd		militant sorry, did i make sense?
2010-01-06T10:16:00.000Z	militant	tawd	that worked.  thanks a ton.  i'm sure ther'es more elegant ways but it did the job that's what counts
