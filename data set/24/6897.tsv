2005-06-19T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	a reasonable minimum is probably 5 GB or so; i think the default install is 1.8 GB
2005-06-19T12:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	the default fs is ext3
2005-06-19T12:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	yeah, you'll need a swap partition too
2005-06-19T12:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	i guess ~ 1 GB is about right for swap
2005-06-19T12:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	it's a swap partition. as dabaslon said, let the installer handle that
2005-06-26T12:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	try here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-06-26T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	according to synaptic, it's a 'NeXTSTEP-like window manager for X'
2005-07-07T08:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	try 'apt-cache search pascal' ?
2005-07-14T14:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	what do you want to know? And what are you trying to do?
2005-07-14T14:32:00.000Z	Whistler	HappyFool	i wanna learn how to use netcat i type nc 127.0.0.1:port but it gives me an erros
2005-07-14T14:33:00.000Z	Whistler	HappyFool	i wanna learn how to use netcat i type nc 127.0.0.1:port but it gives me an error
2005-07-14T14:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	try 'nc 127.0.0.1 port'  where port is a number
2005-07-14T14:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	reading the man page would be a good idea
2005-07-16T12:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	you can probably tell grub to boot your mandrake partition
2005-07-16T13:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	so your system is now booting mandrake?
2005-07-16T13:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	there's no need to repeat yourself
2005-07-16T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	try making the one master, the other slave (if they're on the same ide cable -- err, i don't know sata)
2005-07-16T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	i mean, swap the master/slave arrangement
2005-07-16T13:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	ok, then do what anto9us suggested
2005-07-21T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst  (probably what you want)
2005-10-27T07:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Whistler	have you installed 'build-essential' ?
2005-10-27T07:49:00.000Z	Whistler	HappyFool	thx for help i havent thought of that :D
