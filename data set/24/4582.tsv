2007-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	yes
2007-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	How about XQF?
2007-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	nope sorry, what are you trying to do?
2007-06-15T07:32:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	I have a simple custom command that selects the right patch for the game (2.60 and 2.60b) and it seems to work on everything but 2.60b. I get the error unknown version ET 2.60b linux-i386 May 8 2006
2007-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	doesn't the patch overwrite it and "patch" the game?
2007-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	i guess that i edit each installation...i put in the correct patch, but the config goes by date and i think mine is too specific maybe (ex. May 8 2006 11:48pm) instead of (May 8 2006)
2007-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	well, if it's looking for that specific text, then you'll have to edit the search line
2007-06-15T07:37:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	are you sure ET 2.60b, the folder is still 2.60, just patched?
2007-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	it is a 2.60 install with the 2.60b patch
2007-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	does the 2.60b patch rename the folder location though?
2007-06-15T07:40:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	maybe it's an issue with quakestat? I don't know anything about that program
2007-06-15T07:41:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	are you just trying to run ET?
2007-06-15T07:42:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	i can run ET fine...but i just would like it to select the correct patch because i play on many servers
2007-06-15T07:44:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	and what version does it say you are running?
2007-06-15T07:44:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	I guess I didn't realize you could switch back and forth between patches
2007-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	its weird....i had it working before i accidently jacked up my pc when upgrading from edgy...it was sooo easy before.........It says i'm missing a version that i already have and have played on
2007-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	maybe we could tweak the config a little?
2007-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	dunno, I don't have ET installed at the moment
2007-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	I would imagine the version would be hardcoded in
2007-06-15T07:46:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	you don't need it....could you take a look at the config though? URL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25644/
2007-06-15T07:47:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	so what happens when you type, et --version
2007-06-15T07:47:00.000Z	godofredo07	firefly2442	where?
2007-06-15T07:48:00.000Z	firefly2442	godofredo07	wherever you installed ET
