2005-01-04T08:14:00.000Z	killfill_		hey, how do i use xcompmgr?.. i just got it installed...
2005-01-04T08:14:00.000Z	killfill_		how do i enable transparency and the shadows?.l.
2005-01-04T08:14:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	run it from a terminal
2005-01-04T08:15:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	i am sure you dont want it permanently
2005-01-04T08:17:00.000Z	killfill_	ogra	how do i make things transparent?....
2005-01-04T08:17:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	with transset....which is in a similar state i think (didnt try it since weeks)
2005-01-04T08:20:00.000Z	killfill_	ogra	when i execute xcompmgr, should i see something new?.. i.e. shadows?
2005-01-04T08:21:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	yep, if you run the unstable version of ubuntu (hoary ) with xorg
2005-01-04T08:22:00.000Z	killfill_	ogra	i would guess it depends on a window manager that support the extension?
2005-01-04T08:22:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	it only works with xorg, not with xfree86
2005-01-04T08:23:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	so you run hoary....
2005-01-04T08:23:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	you also use the xcompmgr ubuntu package ?
2005-01-04T08:24:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	so why do you think i could help you in here.... if you not even mention you run another distro ?
2005-01-04T08:26:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	this isnt even linux....heh....
2005-01-04T09:04:00.000Z	killfill_	ogra	ive just setup transparency...   i have a Q for you...  do u think moving windows around with this thins enable... is quick enought?
2005-01-04T09:05:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	not on the various implementations i saw until today
2005-01-04T09:05:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	how does it feel ?
2005-01-04T09:06:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	i tried it from the first release on freedesktop with kdrive instead of xfree until today repeatedly every some monts
2005-01-04T09:09:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	nope, its the former tinyX
2005-01-04T09:09:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	it is just a vesa driver
2005-01-04T09:10:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	so the driver itself is slow, additional to the slowness of transset or xcompmgr
2005-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	it has improved over time, but it will not be usable before summer i think
2005-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	but dont tale me to serious.... i am just guessing
2005-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	ogra	killfill_	in my time assumptions
