2009-12-05T18:50:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	thanks, will try that
2009-12-05T19:19:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Anything wrong with it?
2009-12-05T19:23:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	You installed it from the official ubuntu repository right?
2009-12-05T19:24:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	i got it from using sudo apt-get install openoffice.org in the terminal
2009-12-05T19:25:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	How does your other applications look? Does it look like that too?
2009-12-05T19:25:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	only this one only
2009-12-05T19:25:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	i actually installed it last time because my spell check didn't work and someone said reinstalling it might work
2009-12-05T19:26:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Hold on. There might be a package you need to install. Let me search for it.
2009-12-05T19:26:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	okay thank you
2009-12-05T19:28:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Is openoffice.org-style-human and openoffice.org-gnome installed?
2009-12-05T19:29:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	openoffice.org-gnome is not installed
2009-12-05T19:29:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	should i install that?
2009-12-05T19:29:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Yup. See if that helps.
2009-12-05T19:31:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	installed it but still does not help
2009-12-05T19:32:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Play around in the Tools > Options > View or Appearance see if there are any options to change
2009-12-05T19:33:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	looks like i just have one theme called Openoffice.org, wasn't there supposed to be more like gnome human and stuff?
2009-12-05T19:34:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	If you are talking about the scheme under Appearance, I too only have OpenOffice.org. Yet mine look fine.
2009-12-05T19:35:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	ohh
2009-12-05T19:35:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Wait.
2009-12-05T19:36:00.000Z	khensthoth	datta	Is openoffice.org-gtk installed?
2009-12-05T19:36:00.000Z	datta	khensthoth	 yes it is also installed
