2007-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	romunov		i have a problem with my proftpd
2007-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	romunov		when a user tries to download a file, he gets permission denied
2007-06-04T12:08:00.000Z	romunov		even though i've set permission to download (i use gproftpd)
2007-06-04T12:09:00.000Z	romunov		i've set chmod to 755 of the target directory
2007-06-04T12:10:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	and...?
2007-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	romunov	n2diy	well, i'n trying to solve it :>
2007-06-04T12:12:00.000Z	romunov		i'm out of ideas what could be causing this permission denied message
2007-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	you haven't explained what permission you where denied? Or I missed it, 5 only give read and execute permissions, not write permission.
2007-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	romunov		but does he need write permission from my machine?
2007-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	romunov		from what i gather, you only need read?
2007-06-04T12:14:00.000Z	romunov		firejet Synaptic :)
2007-06-04T12:15:00.000Z	romunov	n2diy	i can copy/paste you the error message in private
2007-06-04T12:16:00.000Z	n2diy		! pastebin | romunov
2007-06-04T12:16:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	with pastebin, everybody can look at it.
2007-06-04T12:18:00.000Z	romunov	n2diy	it seems the damn thing works now
2007-06-04T12:19:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	good, you scared it!
2007-06-04T12:19:00.000Z	romunov		it must be my hairy face
2007-06-04T12:19:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	you might want to explore scp, and ssh, a lot more secure than ftp stuff.
2007-06-04T12:20:00.000Z	romunov		i'm not sure my "users" (a friend) will know how to work on that
2007-06-04T12:20:00.000Z	romunov		i will make a note of it, though
2007-06-04T12:20:00.000Z	romunov		i'll check it out when i find the time
2007-06-04T12:20:00.000Z	romunov		i have to study now
2007-06-04T12:21:00.000Z	n2diy	romunov	gl, 73
