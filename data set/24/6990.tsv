2005-08-08T13:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	Konsole is pretty nice
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	it's just a terminal emulator though
2005-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	I use ``juts a terminal emulator'' all day long
2005-08-08T13:20:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	me too :)
2005-08-09T05:58:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	some are
2005-08-09T05:59:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	like libavcodec, which should be enough for 90% of the files out there :)
2005-08-09T05:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	when compiling, I got the ``all'' codecs package ;)
2005-08-09T05:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	no, from the MPlayer site
2005-08-09T06:00:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	it's easier to use the win32-codecs package from marillat. IMHO :)
2005-08-09T06:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	I wanted to compile mine ;)
2005-08-09T06:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	Systm
2005-08-09T06:05:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	ahh, an exception. I don't compile kernels or shells often
2005-08-09T06:05:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	it's not worth the 3% benefit you'll get
2005-08-09T06:07:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	you mean, it uses MMX and SSE versions just by detecting the processor?
2005-08-09T06:07:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	yes
2005-08-09T06:08:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	not on a box that's 256 MB RAM, 1.6 ghz, that can barely play H.264 as it is
2005-08-09T06:09:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	it depends on the codecs. it does that sort of stuff for libavcodec
2005-08-09T06:12:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	so, recompiling mplayer really helped in playing h.264 properly?
2005-08-09T06:12:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	the speed for that on this machine helped
2005-08-09T06:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	Gentoo with -O5 makes Gnome run with decent speed on my old 486
2005-08-09T06:14:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	well, the maximum level of gcc is -O3 :)
2005-08-09T06:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	Gentoo has some -O5 flags, (IIRC after reading the docs)
2005-08-09T06:15:00.000Z	gregg_	Razor-X	so they patched up gcc?
2005-08-09T06:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	gregg_	I believe so, unless I'm just off here
