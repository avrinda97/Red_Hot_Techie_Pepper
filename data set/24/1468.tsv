2010-01-06T02:03:00.000Z	Nightlight		I've got the error "No such file or directory" when running dsh -f <hostlist> script.sh
2010-01-06T02:05:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	 tried "dsh -f <hostlist> path/to/script.sh"?
2010-01-06T02:06:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	yes
2010-01-06T02:06:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	ive tested with absolute path doesnt work
2010-01-06T02:06:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	 also tried "/path/to/dsh -f <hostlist> path/to/script.sh"?
2010-01-06T02:07:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	well dsh does run because it takes the parameters and asks for remote computer passwords
2010-01-06T02:07:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	ah ok, sry cannot help then
2010-01-06T02:08:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	do u know if it works with scripts ?, i've tested with commands and does work
2010-01-06T02:09:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	no sorry, haven't really used dsh yet
2010-01-06T02:09:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	but when I try with a hello world 2 lines shell script, doesnt find it...
2010-01-06T02:10:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	 also tried "/path/to/dsh -f <hostlist> path/to/script.sh"?
2010-01-06T02:10:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	  "dsh -f <hostlist> -e path/to/script.sh"?
2010-01-06T02:11:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	"-e scriptname"  according to http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/clresctr/vxrx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cluster.csm16.cmds.doc/am7cm_dsh.html
2010-01-06T02:11:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	let me test,
2010-01-06T02:16:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	my current ubuntu's dsh doesnt accept -e parameter, like ibm's AIX
2010-01-06T02:17:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	may I have an incorrect dsh version?, i got it with simply with apt-get install
2010-01-06T02:17:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	no, i think it's ok, linux or *buntu version might vary
2010-01-06T02:20:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	could have anything to do the fact that i'm running with sudo ?
2010-01-06T02:23:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	i'm running it with sudo, could that be related to the error ?
2010-01-06T02:25:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	i doubt that. according to authors homepage and dsh man-page, it really seems not to be able to run scripts
2010-01-06T02:28:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	reaching the end of the page http://www.clusterresources.com/products/torque/docs/1.1installation.shtml  shows how to use DSH with the script... could that be so mistaken ?
2010-01-06T02:29:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	i'm actually trying to remotely install Torque Resource manager (PBS)
2010-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	llutz	Nightlight	really odd, but i have no idea how to solve
2010-01-06T02:32:00.000Z	Nightlight	llutz	Thanks very much for your time anyway !
