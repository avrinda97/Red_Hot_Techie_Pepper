2005-04-16T16:52:00.000Z	Archer		can anyone please help me with the installation of Ubuntu? (noob here)
2005-04-16T16:54:00.000Z	Archer		can anyone help me with "configuring apt" during installation of Ubuntu? thanks.
2005-04-16T16:56:00.000Z	Archer		anyone knows how come during installation, "configuring apt", "setting up primary installation repository", it just stop at 25%?
2005-04-16T16:58:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	I had that problem with an early CD of Hoary... I just installed again and it worked. Don't know why it happened
2005-04-16T16:59:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	i tried many times, but its still the same.
2005-04-16T16:59:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	What disc are you using? Hoary RC?
2005-04-16T05:00:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	erm... i think its the latest Ubuntu 5.04, "The Hoary Hedgehog"
2005-04-16T05:02:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	sorry for my ignorance, but i've never touch linux before
2005-04-16T05:02:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	Try burning the CD again
2005-04-16T05:04:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	Ok.
2005-04-16T05:05:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	by the way, is there anything important that i need to know for installtion of Ubuntu? read some of the documentation, but dont understand the commands etc...
2005-04-16T05:06:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	Not really... it mostly configures everything itself.
2005-04-16T05:07:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	there was once i went pass the Apt configuration, then it tried to install for some websites, but all failed. is there anything wrong?
2005-04-16T05:09:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	The 'websites' are the remote repositories.
2005-04-16T05:09:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	what are repositories?
2005-04-16T05:10:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	They're how software is distributed in the Ubuntu world
2005-04-16T05:10:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	but if i can't install them during the installation, that means my OS can't run right?
2005-04-16T05:11:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	No, it means you won't have a bang-up-to-date system when you first reboot
2005-04-16T05:11:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	oh....
2005-04-16T05:11:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	You can then configure it later so that it can access the internet and get the updates
2005-04-16T05:12:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	Repositories are used to fix bugs and security holes, to allow you to search for the best software for your needs, and to keep everything ticking over smoothly
2005-04-16T05:13:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	after all those installation, it ask me for my login and password, i keyed, and it just stayed there, it dosen't go into a desktop or something, how come?
2005-04-16T05:14:00.000Z	Arnia	Archer	It will need to reboot first... I can't remember the exact installer sequence though: can someone else comment? Who's installed hoary more recently than a few months ago :)
2005-04-16T05:15:00.000Z	Archer	Arnia	by the way, thank you very much for the help. I'll go try out the configuring apt part first
