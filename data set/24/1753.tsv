2009-10-31T20:09:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax		the ubuntu update servers are slow on my pc, is that because of 9.10's release or am i having a strange bug, because the rest of my "net" experience with 9.10 is blazing fast
2009-10-31T20:09:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	More than likely the release is causing it.
2009-10-31T20:10:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	ok as long as it's not on my end, LOL
2009-11-01T03:40:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Is it free?
2009-11-01T03:40:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	virtualbox is free to individuals, not business's. so i guess that depends on whom you are...
2009-11-01T03:40:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	individual
2009-11-01T03:41:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	yes then it's free
2009-11-01T03:41:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Which one is from sun?
2009-11-01T03:42:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	try this link this should help you: http://dlc.sun.com/virtualbox/vboxdownload.html#linux
2009-11-01T03:43:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	ohh and all Virtualbox's whether ose or not, is now form sun, sun bought innotek
2009-11-01T03:44:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	oh hehe, i just noticed it
2009-11-01T03:44:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Well, I use the free version and usb isn't enabled in it. I've tried sharing the folder I want to share and then mapping the drive, but it said that access was denied.
2009-11-01T03:44:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	yeah, sun likes to swallow copanies whole, but they are fore the most part the good guys, giving us open solaris, openoffice, and virtualbox
2009-11-01T03:45:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	my usb stuff works great in the free versions, but not in ose
2009-11-01T03:46:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	get it from the website, not from synaptic or add/remove applications
2009-11-01T03:46:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Hmm, I thought OSE was free.
2009-11-01T03:46:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Oh.  Should I remove OSE then?
2009-11-01T03:47:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	it is free, it's the Open Source Edition of the free. The free is completed, closed, and totally functional. the ose is for programmers who want to add to it.
2009-11-01T03:47:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	i would
2009-11-01T03:47:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Ahh, cool.  I've got a saved machine through OSE, is there anything I should do prior to removing OSE to prevent loss of disk space or anything weird like that?
2009-11-01T03:48:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	i would remove ose, and then download it from here: http://dlc.sun.com/virtualbox/vboxdownload.html#linux, (unless your a 64 bit os man)
2009-11-01T03:48:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	i am afraid that question i don't have an answer too.
2009-11-01T03:49:00.000Z	nkei0	Daedalus-Sax	Okay, I'll just make some more space if I need to be.  Partitions are awesome.
2009-11-01T03:49:00.000Z	Daedalus-Sax	nkei0	good luck, i know all my problems went away when i stopped using ose, i hope the same is for you.
