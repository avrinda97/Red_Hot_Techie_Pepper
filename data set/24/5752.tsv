2008-09-15T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	intel have native drivers for linux, they are already in the kernel
2008-09-15T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	what do you want help with exactly ?
2008-09-15T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	what card do you have
2008-09-15T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	you don't need to install a driver
2008-09-15T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	ubuntu should be aware of that card already
2008-09-15T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	thats a different question
2008-09-15T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	what are you trying to connect to ?
2008-09-15T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	what device are you trying to connect to, is it encypted/not encypted
2008-09-15T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	ok - what type of encyption
2008-09-15T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	you need to "know" what encyption it is - don't guess
2008-09-15T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	look in the router config or in the window config for teh encyuption level
2008-09-15T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	it's not professional level to know what encyption method you setup on your router
2008-09-15T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	depends on your router make, consult the documention
2008-09-15T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Mustafa_Kaya	most routers use a web interface
