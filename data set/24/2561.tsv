2008-11-11T06:57:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i just plugged in another computer (nas actually), i want to see if it is on my network -- is there a command-line utility?
2008-11-11T06:59:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i can see the device if i go under windows network -- but how do i find its ip?
2008-11-11T06:59:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i am looking for an ip scan or something like that
2008-11-11T07:01:00.000Z	bonhoffer		maybe i could get this from /dev somehow -- or media ? or fstab
2008-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	bonhoffer		on my old router i could tell a device's ip address . . .
2008-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	bonhoffer		new router doesn't have this
2008-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	bonhoffer		but i think i can get it from the command line
2008-11-11T07:04:00.000Z	bonhoffer		is there anyway to run fstab after i have now made a device available?
2008-11-11T07:04:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	you mean mount -a
2008-11-24T07:14:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	"kant" can you ping this name? maybe your DNS /etc/resolf.conf isnt finding that mahcine
2008-11-24T07:16:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	you should be able to ping your local machine. maybe the name in /etc/hosts is wrong
2008-11-24T07:17:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	just use the IP instead of the host name :p
2008-11-24T07:18:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	then you have to run the command on the other box that has no ssh server but only a client. and connect to the server from there
2008-11-24T07:18:00.000Z	bonhoffer	zsquareplusc	o.k. makes sense
2008-11-24T07:19:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	using scp either source or target can be a remote machine. you can copy in both directions
2008-11-24T07:27:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	pwd >file.txt  ?
2008-11-24T07:27:00.000Z	bonhoffer	zsquareplusc	let me try
2008-11-24T07:28:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	ah, learn about the TAB key filename autocomplete :-)
2008-11-24T07:28:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	and.. you can connect to scp servers with nautilius. use sftp:// URLs in the address bar
2008-11-24T07:29:00.000Z	bonhoffer	zsquareplusc	i'll try nautilus
2008-11-25T06:50:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	you mean like pressing to power button for 5 seconds to switch it off?
2008-11-25T06:50:00.000Z	bonhoffer	zsquareplusc	the only option with ubuntu?
2008-11-25T06:51:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bonhoffer	you might get suspend to work. it works now with 8.10 on my 700. it wasnt woring on the previous version
2008-11-25T06:51:00.000Z	bonhoffer	zsquareplusc	suspend works fine -- if i type pm-suspend
