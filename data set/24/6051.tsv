2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		Please make sure that:
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		 - You are running a v2.6.7 kernel or later
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		 - That you have sysfs mounted /sys
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		 - That you have the core cpufreq and cpufreq-userspace
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		   modules loaded into your kernel
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		 - That you have the cpufreq driver for your cpu loaded,
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		   (for example: powernow-k7), and that it works. Check
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		   'dmesg' for errors.
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		If all of the above are true, and you still have problems,
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	tim_		please email the author: clemej@alum.rpi.edu
