2008-11-27T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	it was inad922 asking
2009-03-16T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	what sort of changes
2009-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	xorg is dynamic but will still read changes in that file
2009-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	VertScrollDelta in the input device section of my synaptics touchpad.
2009-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	is that still a valid parameter in the version ?
2009-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	i tried adding the specific section and enabled shmconfig there but when i use synclient it's still disabled it says.
2009-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	i bet... how else would one want to configure it?
2009-03-16T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	make sure that's still a valid option, that would be the first thing I've check
2009-03-16T17:08:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	it just scrolls way too much if i use the vertical touchpad scroll slider thing.
2009-03-16T17:08:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	that actually doesn't make sense as long as adjusting the other options doesn't even have any effect too.
2009-03-16T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	1.) it's a new version of xorg from different distros checking parameters are valid is wise 2.) it's dynamic - but it still reads from the config file 3.) I've made changes to my own xorg so I know it picks up the changes so there is either a problem with the parameters or the device
2009-03-16T17:10:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	hmmm. well thanks a lot for your help but i really wonder why it doesn't read my settings. also i wonder how i would just change one single option in the input device section without re-specifying all the stuff that usually would get auto inserted or something...
2009-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	how do you know it's not reading your settings ?
2009-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	how do you know those parameters are still valid ?
2009-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	i adjusted some of the parameters i use without effect
2009-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	that is the point I'm making ?
2009-03-16T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	yes, but if the parmeters are not valid any more then they won't take effect
2009-03-16T17:12:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	then they actually would have taken SHMConfig out, which makes the installation of synclient pointless. right?
2009-03-16T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	I dont know - check ?
2009-03-16T17:16:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	hm, it seems that my specification for the device is just wrong, any idea how i could find out what "Identifier" the auto configured device is using?
2009-03-16T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	check the log for a start ?
2009-03-16T17:17:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	i checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-03-16T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	bassliner	that would have been my first call
2009-03-16T17:18:00.000Z	bassliner	ikonia	well i really have no idea what to do there as the way i did it for the last YEARS absolutely doesn't work anymore... it seems that it really got hard to just alter xorg.conf to your needs to me.
