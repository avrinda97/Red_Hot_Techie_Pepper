2007-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	Think_Differentl		I got a problem. Soon as I start up and log in to a gnome session, the panel is nowhere to be found. have to kill it and reboot.
2007-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 ALT+F2 type 'gnome-panel' and run that
2007-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	but it doesn't always startup right away.
2007-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 If that doesn't work try gnome-terminal and run gnome-panel in that
2007-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	But I need it to start up automatically. Get annoying to kill it and restart.
2007-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 Mine doesn't showup in compizfusion somtimes, but its actually there when you click on it it magically appears
2007-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	Hmm. I just installed fusion. Seems that the config app is br0ken, maybe that's it?
2007-09-16T06:52:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 /\
2007-09-16T06:52:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	K, I'll see what happens.
2007-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 Also I think compiz fusion needs to be a bit delayed at start if you know basic shell scripting you can use sleep to wait a little bit
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	Nope, same problem.
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	But I dont start it when I login. I use Beryl-manager to start up the special wm's.
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	http://pastebin.ca/699066 is what i get when I try to run ccsm
2007-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 Looks like you need to install the compiz gconf plugin, also check that your running the uptodate version
2007-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	I'll see.
2007-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	found a package under compiz that seems to be it, installing.
2007-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	http://pastebin.ca/699070 seems like that installing that one package didnt help much.
2007-09-16T07:04:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	any ideas?
2007-09-16T07:05:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 Nope, just make sure your using the very latest build
2007-09-16T07:06:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	very latest build of compiz. checked out at around 1pm.
2007-09-16T07:13:00.000Z	EbilPhish	Think_Differentl	 It might be worth trying to install everything in the repos that looks like its part of compiz
2007-09-16T07:13:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	I think that some of the packages need to be updated.
2007-09-16T07:14:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	if that doesn't work, i'm just going to remove it.
2007-09-16T07:16:00.000Z	Think_Differentl	EbilPhish	FIXED! Turns out that half of the packages were out of date. Should've seen that earilier. Now lets hope gnome-panel runs ok. :)
