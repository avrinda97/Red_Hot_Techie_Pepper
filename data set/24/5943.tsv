2006-03-20T15:40:00.000Z	Titan		Ok, here is an interesting one.  How do when I set the permission for a folder, such as who has write ability and such, ensure that it replecates all they way down to every file within that folder?

2006-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	could have also typed man chmod.. its right there, first page
2006-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	first page of what?
2006-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	man chmod
2006-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	should say only page
2006-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	thanks :)
2006-03-20T15:47:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	ok, I am not understanding this. I have typed: chmod -R /home/titan/WoW   to change it so I have rights to right to everything in that folder but it gives me a 'to few arguments' error.
2006-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	you forgot the permissions. chmod 755 -R /home/titan/WoW
2006-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	except 755 isn't what you want. thats just an example
2006-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	no.. I did not forget it, I just did not know about it =P I am pretty new to linux.
2006-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	woops. typos. chmod -R 755 /some/path
2006-03-20T15:49:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	ahh. well you get it
2006-03-20T15:49:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	ummm... so how do I tell what numbers I type instead of 775, I don't understand those mans. :(
2006-03-20T15:50:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	hrm. thats hard to . that man chmod explains it, but reading that stuff is nearly impossible.
2006-03-20T15:51:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	ya, I do not understand it, oh well I will go back and look again. THanks.
2006-03-20T15:51:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	the first digit is the owners permissions. the second the groups, the third is everyone else. so 755 is owner has permission of 7, group of 5 and everyone else 5
2006-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	so if I say chmod 777 -R /path   then that should set it so everyone has writes to read, write and execute?
2006-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	you got it
2006-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	awsome :) Thanks alot!
2006-03-20T15:53:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	not a good idea. 755 is already a lot of access
2006-03-20T15:54:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	oh ok, I think I am owner anyhow so  Ishould be fine to do 755
2006-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	Titan	jjs01h	it worked, thanks alot for your help. I'm off, got some martial arts to do, thanks again.
2006-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	jjs01h	Titan	np.
