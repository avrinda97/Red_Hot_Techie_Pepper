2009-10-05T11:06:00.000Z	undeclaredx		yeah
2009-10-05T11:06:00.000Z	undeclaredx		its the equivilent of explorer on windows
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	undeclaredx		no I mean I know its KDE vs Gnome
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	undeclaredx		but I'm not really sure what the differences are
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	undeclaredx		I haven't much used it as a desktop..ever
2009-10-05T11:08:00.000Z	undeclaredx		how does it suck?
2009-10-05T11:10:00.000Z	undeclaredx		and make sure wherever you ssh to allows this kind of dynamic forwarding
2009-10-05T11:10:00.000Z	undeclaredx		socks proxy @ localhost:1080
2009-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	undeclaredx		port 1080
2009-10-05T11:12:00.000Z	undeclaredx		For general desktop use, its generally agreed ubuntu is the best? or will I go to #kubuntuand they'll be like "gnome sucks KDE ROOLZ"?
2009-10-05T11:12:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	there are 2versions for a reason
2009-10-05T11:13:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	I really would like to find a good comparison between the two.. but its hard to find a proper google search thus far
2009-10-05T11:13:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	i don't think you will find out so much, compare between gnome.org/kde.org
2009-10-05T11:14:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	all I've heard is KDE is more bloated, but that's it
2009-10-05T11:14:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	you can have both installed at the same time and just switch back and fourth, i guess that's the easiest way of making up your mind
2009-10-05T11:14:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	no shit? how?
2009-10-05T11:14:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	it's not big difference to me thou, basicly the same.
2009-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	just apt-get the proper packages, then when I log in I choose?
2009-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	yes
2009-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	I'll test it out, thanks
2009-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	is there specific packages or do I just go to the package manager type in KDE and its done?
2009-10-05T11:15:00.000Z	rsk	undeclaredx	kubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-desktop depending on what you have installed already
2009-10-05T11:16:00.000Z	undeclaredx		k
2009-10-05T11:16:00.000Z	undeclaredx	rsk	yeah im on ubuntu now
