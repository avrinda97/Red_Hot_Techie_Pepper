2007-07-30T12:40:00.000Z	parawizard		I was wondering about kernels and SMP. I have a ubuntu fiesty and a ubuntu studio installation on two different PCs here. The fiesty sees all 4 cores of my Q6600 CPU but the ubuntustudio does not, on either generic or low latency.
2007-07-30T12:42:00.000Z	parawizard		weird
2007-07-30T12:43:00.000Z	parawizard		Would it be usual for a UbuntuStudio installation to not install for SMP?
2007-07-30T12:43:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	SMP is default enabled in recent kernels
2007-07-30T12:43:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	fiesty installed with smp support on my quad core but in ubuntu studio Its only using 1 core
2007-07-30T12:44:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	check boot options for nosmp. other than that, it is strange
2007-07-30T12:47:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	boot options in menu.lst? If so I dont see any sign of a no smp boot option
2007-07-30T12:49:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	as told it is default enabled with recent kernels
2007-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	could it be that it isnt included in the Ubuntustudio text based installer dvd? should I just reinstall the generic kernel package using synaptic?
2007-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	may be they explicitly set off smp for ubuntustudio, you can always install you kernel anyway
2007-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	if I choose to reinstall the generic packages for both it should work itself out?
2007-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	don'T think so. But trying is better than asking me :)
2007-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	:P I know what to do on gentoo but havent twiddled with ubuntu yet ;p
2007-07-30T12:54:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	don't hesitate to dig through I'd say
2007-07-30T12:54:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	after all , you know everything on linux are files. What could happen worse ?
2007-07-30T12:55:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	indeed :) but its sort of a daisy chain haha. I should really burn some of these wireless drivers etc to a dvd. Need another pc just to get Ubuntu up and running atm
2007-07-30T13:03:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	haha no dice with kernel upgrade to *-16 from *-15 :) I guess my installations config files are building for non smp?
2007-07-30T13:04:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	how no dice ?
2007-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	it is impossible not being able to install a new kernel. IT's just your old system may not boot :)
2007-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	I upgraded to newer kernels but is still no smp (through synamptic)
2007-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	compile it from source
2007-07-30T13:05:00.000Z	parawizard	reverseblade	k hehe the new kernel killed my xgl/ati or something
2007-07-30T13:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	no just reinstall your binary video drivers
2007-07-30T13:32:00.000Z	reverseblade	parawizard	ubuntu uses smp already
