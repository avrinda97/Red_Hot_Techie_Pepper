2008-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	you mount them as iso's in the link vocx gave you
2008-10-05T13:30:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	i only have mdf files no iso. i know though how to mount -o loop /iso/image/files
2008-10-05T13:30:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	i would prefer not to convert them
2008-10-05T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	what does "file" against them show
2008-10-05T13:32:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	i am not too sure what you are asking, but i need to mount mdf files preferly from the terminal but i guess. if i have to do i can do it from a gui front
2008-10-05T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	I'm asking you to run "file" against the mdf files
2008-10-05T13:34:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	vocxi: oh i am sorry. i misunderstood you. thank i will try it now
2008-10-05T13:35:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	vocx: ISO 9660 cd-rom filesystem data udf filesystem data (unknown version, id 'nsr01')
2008-10-05T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	looks like that should work as a loop back file system
2008-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	-mount -o loop but instead of .iso .mdf? or the .mds file?
2008-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	try it, linux see's it as a "image" so it may work
2008-10-05T13:38:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	vocx: wow it worked, i feel retard for nto trying before asking.  thanks
2009-04-29T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	why ? there is nothing wrong with installing with drives in
2009-04-29T13:16:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	of coruse there is nothing wrong with installing these distros onto those formats, but when you mean to install your new OS to a harddrive and NOT wipe out your extra harddrive is not what I wanted.
2009-04-29T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	so basiclly - you made a user error, so you suggest people take out disks to stop them making your personal user error
2009-04-29T13:19:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	it was my mistake to leave the extra harddrive plugged in.  So in the end, I ended up wiping my extra harddrive that I just backed up everything to.  So, for troubleshooting and failsafe would be to remove the external harddrive form the computer.  So for my poor english, I meant to say external not extra harddrive***
2009-04-29T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	swapoff
2009-04-29T20:40:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	I did that sir.  I just to unmont after swapoff it with gparted. At least, I am told...
2009-04-29T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	so whats the problem if you've unmounted it
2009-04-29T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	you don't mount swap
2009-04-29T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sugi	swapoff is effectivly unmount
2009-04-29T20:44:00.000Z	sugi	ikonia	Oh kay, thnak you for the information. The website was miss leading.
