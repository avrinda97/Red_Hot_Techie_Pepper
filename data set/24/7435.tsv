2008-04-27T15:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_		wobbly windows, deskotp cube and rotate cube
2008-04-27T15:15:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	do you know what video chipset/manuf you have?
2008-04-27T15:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	nvidia FX 5200 GT
2008-04-27T15:16:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	e.g. if you have an nvidia chipset you may need to run Applications->System->HArdware Drivers to install the "nvidia" drivers to get wobbly windows?
2008-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	ok, im a little new to this
2008-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	no prob
2008-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	there is no system tab in apps, there is no hardware tab in system tab next to app tab
2008-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	I think* you'll ned the proprietary nvidia drivers (using that "Hardware Drivers" item) and then a reboot
2008-04-27T15:18:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	"applications" menu..  to "System" menu item..
2008-04-27T15:18:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	perhaps right-click on desktop to get the menu?
2008-04-27T15:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	im just booting 8.04 form the cd
2008-04-27T15:19:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	aah.. umnn.. then I dunno.  you might* not be able to test wobly windows with just the live cd..  you might* be able to specify a special boot argument to specify nvidia drivers, but I don't think so.
2008-04-27T15:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	I click apps then system?
2008-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	I'm operating on the assumption* that the nvidia driver is required for compiz (wobbly windows) effects.. which probably* isn't available in the live cd interface.. (but is just a click or two once installed. ?)
2008-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	how would I normally go about it, just to try it anyway
2008-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	incase it does work on the cd
2008-04-27T15:21:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	apps->system->hardware_drivers
2008-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_	tkooda	under the system menu I have pref and admin as the main two
2008-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	tkooda	ubuntu_	graingert confirms that the live cd doesn't have the proprietary nvidia driver required for your hardwrae to utilize the compiz effects (wobbly windows).. ..which I believe* means that you'd need to do an install (or a buncha* work to get it going for each boot on a livecd)
