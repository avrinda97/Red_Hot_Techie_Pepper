2010-09-02T03:38:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	So do I have to worry about people hacking into the root account?
2010-09-02T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	no
2010-09-07T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	why not just use ubuntu?  Why small?  Ubuntu fits on a cd
2010-09-07T04:58:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	Ubuntu doesn't boot from grub nor from the live CD
2010-09-07T04:58:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	rather, I screwed up grub
2010-09-07T04:58:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	how did you install it?
2010-09-07T04:59:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	the same way I tried to do it when it didn't work
2010-09-07T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	huh?  Presumably, you installed ubuntu at some point since it's failing to boot from grub now
2010-09-07T05:00:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	Let me rephrase that; I installed from the Live CD on a USB
2010-09-07T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	ok.  Use that
2010-09-07T05:01:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	I no longer have the USB; I tried reinstalling and booting from it with no success
2010-09-07T05:01:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	they both stopped at one point and didn't continue
2010-09-07T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	boot the cd then.  Make sure you don't have a bad burn
2010-09-11T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	no, you don't need to reinstall
2010-09-11T05:40:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	I just tried the command and I got "No LSB modules are available."
2010-09-11T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	then you aren't using ubuntu
2010-09-11T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	or maybe you didn't type in what ubottu said
2010-09-11T05:42:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	crap, sorry
2010-09-11T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	I guess you forgot the "-a"?
2010-09-11T05:42:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	excuse the language
2010-09-11T05:43:00.000Z	latagore	jrib	Yes I forgot
2011-02-11T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	if you have a router, did you forward the ssh port correctly?
2011-02-11T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	latagore	run « sudo iptables -L ».  That will tell you whether or not it's a firewall issue
