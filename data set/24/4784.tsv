2007-01-13T14:42:00.000Z	pollywog		then you use fakeroot to build them
2007-01-13T14:43:00.000Z	pollywog		this is just different, that's all
2007-01-13T14:43:00.000Z	pollywog		Ubuntu detects all the hardware

2007-01-13T14:45:00.000Z	pollywog		aptitude does not work?
2007-01-13T14:45:00.000Z	pollywog		I did not use it much I like apt
2007-01-13T14:45:00.000Z	jc-denton	pollywog	when i do apt-get update it stops at a certain point
2007-01-13T14:46:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	maybe you need to change the mirrors in sources.list
2007-01-13T14:47:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	apt-get check ?
2007-01-13T14:52:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	you have lots of URI's in your source.list?
2007-01-13T14:52:00.000Z	jc-denton	pollywog	?
2007-01-13T14:53:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	sometimes you need to change a setting in apt.conf to accommodate more URI's
2007-01-13T14:53:00.000Z	jc-denton	pollywog	i did not add or remove anything recently
2007-01-13T14:54:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	try going to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive and adding a couple of mirrors from that page
2007-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	I think maybe there is an extraneous character in the file you are using
2007-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	jc-denton	pollywog	in whcih file?
2007-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	I just found today that my default list contained UK mirrors and that was causing slowness
2007-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	jc-denton	pollywog	apt-get check
2007-01-13T14:58:00.000Z	pollywog	jc-denton	yes I think you have a bad file
