2009-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	Missing method Do.Pl
2009-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	does typing "gnome-do" in a terminal work for you now?  Make sure you close it first
2009-11-06T21:51:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	It does run but I get a [Error 16:50:08.273] Error in RunOnMainThread: Method not found: 'Do.Platform.AbstractApplicationService.RunOnThread'.
2009-11-06T21:52:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	how about the other app you were trying to make startup automaticaly?
2009-11-06T21:52:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	It just aborted on its own right now.
2009-11-06T21:53:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	Dropbox works fine from the terminal no errors there.
2009-11-06T21:54:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	well try giving an absolute path at the start-up setup
2009-11-06T21:55:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	If i was to remove a specific application completely with configuration files. How would I go about
2009-11-06T21:55:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	aptitude purge PACKAGE
2009-11-06T21:55:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	if you want to also remove user settings you need to delete those on your own

2009-11-06T21:56:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	better in what sense?
2009-11-06T21:58:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	I am still tryin to gather the difference between aptitude and apt-get, I have googled it a bit but still not sure.
2009-11-06T21:58:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	so as to which is better
2009-11-06T21:58:00.000Z	jrib	nerve	they are just different front-ends to APT.  aptitude is better
2009-11-06T21:59:00.000Z	nerve	jrib	Thanks a lot buddy Cheers.
