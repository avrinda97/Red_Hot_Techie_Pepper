2006-10-22T16:23:00.000Z	shadowhywind		does anyone know how to unzip 7zip?
2006-10-22T16:25:00.000Z	shadowhywind		ark doesn't let me uncompress it any ideas?
2006-10-22T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	sudo apt-get install p7zip
2006-11-01T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	yes
2007-06-09T06:09:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	what did you do that resulted in that?
2007-06-09T06:09:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	reboot into recovery mode
2007-06-09T06:10:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	reboot into recovery mode and remove yourself from the root group. make sure you are in the admin group, however
2007-06-09T06:11:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	use "deluser <user> <group>" to remove an user from a group, and "adduser <user> <group>" to add it to one
2007-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	... ?
2007-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	do you think it would make sense to remove a group from a user that doesn't yet exist?
2007-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	why did you try to add your user to the "root" group, anyway?
2007-06-09T06:14:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	yes. if you forget the "root" part, however, it will delete your user, so be careful.
2007-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	does "groups" list "admin"?
2007-06-09T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	uhm, that might be slightly over my head, but i think i'd make a *new* group and set the permissions to root:newgroup
2007-06-09T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	then just use root to make any changes, i'm afraid... adding a normal user to the root group can't be a good idea.
2007-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	i'm not sure why it'd kill sudo, but it's something i'd never do for any reason anyway
2007-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	type "groups"
2007-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	did what i suggested not work?
2007-06-09T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	removing the group *from* the user, not removing the group. anyway you typed "deluser shadowhywind root" and then "adduser shadowhywind admin", correct?
2007-06-09T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	it should normally also list a few other groups
2007-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	for me, it lists:   !%1 > %2    (%2, see the private message from Ubotu)
2007-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	meh, nevermind that
2007-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	for me, it lists:   ljl adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip www-data video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
2007-06-09T06:29:00.000Z	LjL	shadowhywind	you probably want to re-add the other groups as well... cdrom, audio, etc. or you won't be able to read from your cdrom or use audio, etc ;)
