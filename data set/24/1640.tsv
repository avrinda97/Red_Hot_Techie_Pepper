2011-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	unmaximize the screen?
2011-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	the netbooks have a resolution problem somtimes
2011-01-10T12:43:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	i tried that
2011-01-10T12:44:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	or you can try to 'tab' thru the settings
2011-01-10T12:45:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	not a fan of netbook edition myself, just use the normal and make due
2011-01-10T12:46:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	click on the top bar and it move you down to the rest of the screen
2011-01-10T12:46:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	lame, but it can help
2011-01-10T12:47:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	im about to try that.. its just a crap dell mini and for the most part the stripped linux seems ot be quite fast.. also the mini netbook as a whole is a problem to use at times but im in the field so i need the portable thing
2011-01-10T12:47:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	would normal ubuntu run just as fast as this netbook one ?? im not sure were to get good reviews between the 2 or speed tests
2011-01-10T12:48:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	i think it does, tried the netbook ed, and didnt like it.  Run the regular desktop on my hp mini9, happy with it
2011-01-10T12:49:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	I personally dont like the netbook version
2011-01-10T12:50:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	may I ask what you found to be the major differance ... as i know this is a matter or prefferance more then anything
2011-01-10T12:50:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	i think the netbook edition is just 'trying' to make the most of the sceen size
2011-01-10T12:50:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	but i dont really find it an advantage
2011-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	you can always flip between the two easy enough
2011-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	i dont like the restrictions against a regular desktop
2011-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	thats what I've read anyway
2011-01-10T12:52:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	I dont find speed to be a problem at all, but I did upgrade to 2 gigs or ram...
2011-01-10T12:53:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	of course, it, the usb or disc version, will feel slower
2011-01-10T12:54:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	is there a usb bootable install??
2011-01-10T12:54:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	yes
2011-01-10T12:54:00.000Z	mkquist	Cpt_Zyph	im assuming you mean Ubuntu btw
2011-01-10T12:54:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	mkquist	correct
