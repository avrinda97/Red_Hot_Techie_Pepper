2006-01-14T11:26:00.000Z	jamie		Quick question, the sounds in ubuntu work fine, but when I play a game there is no sound.
2006-01-14T08:45:00.000Z	jamie		When I open synaptic I get this (along with all the other repositories listed) However I am getting it on both of my computers, and it was fine yesterday. I am unable to apt-get anything either
2006-01-14T08:46:00.000Z	jamie		W: Couldn't stat source package list http://us.archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
