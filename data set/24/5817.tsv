2006-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Warbo	What about Adobe Flash? :P
2006-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	DJAdmiral	It costs way more, doesn't have as many features, and runs terribly in WINE :)

2006-08-20T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	DJAdmiral	You will need a license to run Windows ME
2006-08-20T11:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Warbo	I have one.
2006-08-20T11:42:00.000Z	Warbo	DJAdmiral	vmware-player cannot create new systems, so you may need the server one (whichever one is also free, but not in Ubuntu)
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Warbo	so I need VMWare Player and VMWare server?
2006-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	Warbo	DJAdmiral	I don't know if you need the player if you have the server, just that the player alone can't do it (without some messing around)
2006-08-20T11:44:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Warbo	on vmware.com it says that the vmware player can run systems created by vmware workstation, symantec disk thingy or something and microsoft virtual machines
2006-08-20T11:45:00.000Z	Warbo	DJAdmiral	I know that a new image cannot be made with VMWare player, but that is about it
