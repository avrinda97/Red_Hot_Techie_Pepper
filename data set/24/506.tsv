2011-08-27T14:40:00.000Z	segunda_hora		Hello, how do I check if an ssh server is running on ubuntu?
2011-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	pgrep sshd
2011-08-27T14:41:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	it returned a three digit number.
2011-08-27T14:42:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	OK, so that's the process ID of the running ssh server. Which means you have one!
2011-08-27T14:43:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Are you getting errors, no response, or what?
2011-08-27T14:44:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	putty hangs for a while when I try the internet address and network connection refused on local address
2011-08-27T14:46:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Try restarting the server.
2011-08-27T14:46:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	physically, or by a command?
2011-08-27T14:47:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	I meant the SSH server. sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
2011-08-27T14:52:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Give me a minute...
2011-08-27T14:55:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	netstat -a |grep LISTEN         Is anything listed for port 22?
2011-08-27T15:00:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	if the numbers after "listening" or ports, then port 22 is not listed.
2011-08-27T15:00:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	or = are
2011-08-27T15:01:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Odd. Look in /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Near the top will be a Port entry - is that set to 22?
2011-08-27T15:03:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Sorry, in the netstat output did you see something like   "tcp        0      0 *:22                 *:*                     LISTEN"?
2011-08-27T15:04:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	in config, yes after the comment "what port we listen for etc." there is a Port 22 entry. In the netstats there was a tcp ... ssh ... listen entry
2011-08-27T15:05:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Looks like a firewall issue then. Can you ssh in using localhost?
2011-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	yes using the server machine (obviously?)
2011-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Definitely firewall. Not my area of expertise, I'm afraid.
2011-08-27T15:07:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	I haven't installed any firewalls. I appreciate that you've done all you can but any suggestions to determine if it's a virus type problem?
2011-08-27T15:08:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	There's a firewall running by default. Its settings must have got changed somehow. Unlikely to be a virus since you'd need root access to mess with it.
2011-08-27T15:09:00.000Z	squaregoldfish	segunda_hora	Unless you've done something silly of course ;)
2011-08-27T15:09:00.000Z	segunda_hora	squaregoldfish	:P thanks I will see what firewall users do to run ssh
