2009-05-12T16:33:00.000Z	kr0y		My network manager options are grayed out in Jaunty
2009-05-12T16:34:00.000Z	kr0y		I can connect to wired network by changing interfaces, resolv.conf files and restarting network
2009-05-12T16:34:00.000Z	kr0y		Can anyone help me how to connect to wireless?
2009-05-12T16:34:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	is network-manager daemon running ?
2009-05-12T16:34:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	you've got two parts: the applet and the daemon
2009-05-12T16:35:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	not quite an expert myself. I'd say check system monitor -> all processes for the network manager process
2009-05-12T16:35:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	nm-applet seems to be present
2009-05-12T16:35:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	that's the applet
2009-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	you need the service behind it
2009-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	So how do I enable it?
2009-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	the service is called "NetworkManager"
2009-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	make sure view-"all processes" is enabled in system monitor
2009-05-12T16:36:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	 ps aux | grep 'nm' root      3158  0.0  0.1   7884  3612 ?        S    11:48   0:00 /usr/sbin/nm-system-settings --config /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf
2009-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	if it's not there ... hmm ... I don't know how to start it :)
2009-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	yep, that's it
2009-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	so it is running ...
2009-05-12T16:37:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	have you tried restaring it?
2009-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	Not yet. will restart it now
2009-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	good luck ...
2009-05-12T16:38:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	is it a fresh install? or did your wireless work in previous installs?
2009-05-12T16:39:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	tons of Network manager bugreports here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager
2009-05-12T16:39:00.000Z	forceflow	kr0y	might be a good idea to search there for your case :)
2009-05-12T16:47:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	Stopping Network manager daemon from system monitor hanged my computer
2009-05-12T16:47:00.000Z	kr0y	forceflow	Now restarting shows NM working but enable wireless checkbox is grayed out
