2008-10-31T11:37:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	How?
2008-10-31T11:37:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	shift page up
2008-10-31T11:37:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	you can still scroll up
2008-10-31T11:37:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	Should I have linux-image installed?
2008-10-31T11:35:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	dpkg -l | grep linux
2008-10-31T11:36:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	That flows way out of my screen (no x seeing nvidia doe not work)
2008-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	but pipe it through less.   dpke -l | grep 'linux-image' | less
2008-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	Nice :)  I have worked for years not knowing how to scroll!
2008-10-31T11:39:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	i live in the console, hardly start x at all.   so less is a must.
2008-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	Hmm what do you do for web browsing?
2008-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	elinks
2008-10-31T11:41:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	I see, I have used elinks from time to time but always find it lacking (probibly because I have never learned all the keyboard commands) :)
2008-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	there is also links2 which supports graphics, lynx w3m, or one can wget <url.here> | html2text | fold -s | less      # hehhe why use a web browser at all....  :)
2008-10-31T11:45:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	Mostly I use it to work with my gateway away from home hence the need for a browser so I can log in.  Do you happen to know where grubs menu is stored nowdays?  I looked in /boot but there is no grub?
2008-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	After spending all that time on the command line you don`t know a magic little command to do that?
2008-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	never plaied there before
2008-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	You could always write a simple script to do it
2008-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	i can probably cludge togather something with  while read ;do
2008-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	They always have a space?  I could write one in perl pretty quick if I had my xserver back...  I like my mouse!
2008-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	i was hoping some knew a secret tho
2008-10-31T11:56:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	yes always a space for "IFS"
2008-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	Hmm, that would be pretty easy to do then
2008-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	_2	Gokee2	i think i have it with awk.  thanks tho
2008-10-31T11:58:00.000Z	Gokee2	_2	See I knew you had the magic in you with al the command line time :)
