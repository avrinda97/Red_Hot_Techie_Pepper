2005-02-03T12:26:00.000Z	quitte		has someone successfully compiled pcmcia-cs modules for a 2.6 kernel - or can tell me how to do that?
2005-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	quitte		i need a driver that only exists as a patch to pcmcia-cs.
2005-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	quitte		and i dont want to go back to 2.4
2005-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	njan	quitte	I'm not sure that pcmcia-cs works properly with the 2.6-series kernel..
2005-02-03T12:27:00.000Z	njan	quitte	I seem to remember reading in the documentation that a lot of the drivers aren't compilable for 2.6..
2005-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	njan	quitte	but I may be wrong, don't quote me on that; I'd check the pcmcia-cs documentation if I were you. That'll tell you either way, and if it's possible, it'll tell you how to compile them.
2005-02-03T12:28:00.000Z	quitte	njan	should be possible. i got latest source from the project homepage
2005-02-03T12:29:00.000Z	quitte	njan	but configuring it it told me to disable pcmcia support in kernel - so i did. then it told me to enable it in kernels newer than 2.5 :/
2005-02-08T13:27:00.000Z	njan	quitte	no it didn't :p
2005-02-08T13:27:00.000Z	quitte	njan	really? i used xmms when i never heard of gnome
2005-02-08T13:27:00.000Z	njan	quitte	mst gnome existed before the gnome project started
2005-02-08T13:28:00.000Z	quitte	njan	ok
2005-02-08T13:29:00.000Z	njan	quitte	 X11amp v1 ?? Nov 97 -> ?? ??? 97
2005-02-08T13:30:00.000Z	quitte	njan	just found that,too
2005-02-08T13:30:00.000Z	quitte	njan	hmm. kde vs gnome?
2005-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	quitte	njan	kde announcement in 96.
2005-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	njan	quitte	yeah, kde's older
2005-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	njan	quitte	because gnome was founded specifically because kde wasn't free :)
2005-02-08T13:33:00.000Z	quitte	njan	yeah. i remember that time. so it really is almost ten years i'm using linux now
2005-02-08T13:34:00.000Z	njan	quitte	I wasn't really aware of the founding of gnome, but I was certainly aware of the unfreeness of KDE in my first stages of using linux, so I would've started using linux for the first time shortly after then :)
2005-02-08T13:35:00.000Z	njan	quitte	I started out using DEC machines which were purloined from a skip :)
2005-02-08T13:36:00.000Z	quitte	njan	my first was linux. my first computing experiences were with a c64. i broke the floppy drives after a few weeks. couldn'T afford a new one. so i learned basic
2005-02-08T13:37:00.000Z	quitte	njan	took me a while from finding it good to have free software to finding it bad to have non-free software.
2005-02-08T13:37:00.000Z	quitte	njan	suse 6.2-6.3 time
