2011-08-07T12:06:00.000Z	JZApples		I have an external RAID 10 array hooked up to my computer via USB, should I add that to fstab and if so, should I just use defaults for the options?????
2011-08-07T12:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	usb raid device, doesn't sound like a good idea
2011-08-07T12:07:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	why, it works great.
2011-08-07T12:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	is it a hardware raid device ?
2011-08-07T12:07:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	yes, hardware raid
2011-08-07T12:08:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	does it auto mount when you plug it in ?
2011-08-07T12:08:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	it does, but it might not always be turned on when the computer boots.
2011-08-07T12:08:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	then leave it out of fstab
2011-08-07T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	incorrect
2011-08-07T12:15:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	don't put it in fstab though
2011-08-07T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	1.) you are not using software raid 2.) you already have a raid device
2011-08-07T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	it's important if you are going to follow guides that they apply to your system
2011-08-07T12:16:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	i have two raid arrays setup.  One software, one hardware.
2011-08-07T12:16:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	so please don't include it in /etc/fstab
2011-08-07T12:17:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	if it an external device you should not include it in /etc/fstab
2011-08-07T12:17:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	software RAID in using SATA ports on my mobo.  Hardware RAID is external enclosure via USB.
2011-08-07T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	in what way ?
2011-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	just to send an email if mdadm reports an error.
2011-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	that's nothing to do with hotmail
2011-08-07T13:38:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	can i use it to send my hotmail account an email?  how do i configure it for that?
2011-08-07T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	postfix is just an mta - you need a client to send the mail
2011-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	mdadm uses the mail command to send mail
2011-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	JZApples	ikonia	so how do i configure that?
2011-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	JZApples	mail is just the client, you need to configure an mta such as postfix, or a remote smtp relay (such as your ISP's)
