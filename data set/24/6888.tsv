2005-06-28T06:09:00.000Z	refuze2looze	zyth	what kind of job can you get with A+ and MSCE? how do they pay
2005-06-28T06:09:00.000Z	zyth	refuze2looze	network technician, $25/hr or so starting
2005-06-28T06:10:00.000Z	refuze2looze	zyth	hey that's not bad..
2005-06-28T06:10:00.000Z	zyth	refuze2looze	or you can freelance PC repair for like $60/hr but you have to build up contacts
2005-06-28T06:10:00.000Z	zyth	refuze2looze	I quit my last job cause they were making about $60/hr more off of me than they were paying me.
2005-06-28T06:12:00.000Z	refuze2looze	zyth	i had a $15/hr computer technician job with no degree/certification and they were charging $75/hour. it's pretty normal for them to make $60 an hour off you

2005-06-28T06:13:00.000Z	refuze2looze	zyth	i should have gotten MSCEs, i was thinking of doing it
