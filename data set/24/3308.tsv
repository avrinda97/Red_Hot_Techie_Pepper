2008-02-27T07:08:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	You need to be able to get the "ndiswrapper" package and the drivers to the computer somehow...
2008-02-27T07:09:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	Yeah thats ok. Hooking up the ethenet connection should work
2008-02-27T07:11:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	Going through the ethernet (eth0 - the default connection), follow the tutorial. It worked for me
2008-02-27T07:17:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	Ok sweet.
2008-02-27T08:36:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	did you get it working?
2008-02-27T08:36:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	ah damn. What does "ndiswrapper -l" give you?
2008-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	yeah it took me a while and i gave up for a bit.. but once you get everything working it all gets easier. and awesome! Compiz-fusion is sick
2008-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	 look it up on youtube. its not for networking, just for eyecandy
2008-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	 like cool wobbly windows and stuff'
2008-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	 that will hopefully get your firmware working
2008-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	it should prompt you for the driver files
2008-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	I installed my drivers through ndiswrapper w/ that other tutorial I gave you
2008-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	 yeah i think its b/c we have different cards
2008-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	aimchanger	yo___	try the command that macogw gave ya
