2005-11-02T17:59:00.000Z	trappist		how to make an initrd for the kernel I'm trying to install?  I keep ending up with an initrd for my running kernel.  and while I'm at it, why didn't make install make my initrd for me?
2005-11-02T17:59:00.000Z	trappist		or make-kpkg for that matter
2005-11-02T17:59:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	do you need an initrd?
2005-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	you only need an initrd for modules that are required to read your filesystem (aka ext3 or reiserfs)
2005-11-02T06:01:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	well my fs is compiled in.  so I just disable initrd support and rebuild?
2005-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	you don't need to disable initrd support, just don't include an initrd line in grub.conf
2005-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	I did try that.  unable to mount rootfs.
2005-11-02T06:03:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	I tried including the initrd to solve the problem.  used the wrong initrd and it doesn't contain the new /lib/modules, and I get a very different error.
2005-11-02T06:03:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	eh, then you probably compiled the fs driver as a module and you'll need an initrd.
2005-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	I triple-checked that the fs driver is built in, but I'm happy to build an initrd if I can figure out how to build a good one.
2005-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	it is a command line option to makeinitrd, but I don't remember the syntax.
2005-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	yeah and the man page isn't much help
2005-11-02T06:06:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	the wife says I have to go eat now, sorry I can't help
2006-04-03T12:03:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	nobody is not supposed to have a home directory though ...
2006-04-03T12:03:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	he has one listed in /etc/passwd but /nonexistent shouldn't exist
2006-04-03T12:03:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	unless you tell pam to create home dirs
2006-04-03T12:04:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	I misunderstood what he said he found, I thought he found an actuall /home/nonexcistant directory.
2006-04-03T12:05:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	yeah the wording was a little funny
2006-04-03T13:13:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	+X adds +x to directories only?  cool ... I usually used find -type ;)
2006-04-03T13:34:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	you just need a "RTFMP" button.
2006-04-03T13:37:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	the man page notwithstanding, -r and -R aren't equivalent
2006-04-03T13:42:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	what is the difference between -R and -r?  I always use -r for cp.
2006-04-03T13:43:00.000Z	trappist	Falstius	iirc -R won't copy special files like device files, socket files, etc.
2006-04-05T13:26:00.000Z	Falstius	trappist	he just told pat_ that they can't really speak french here ;)
