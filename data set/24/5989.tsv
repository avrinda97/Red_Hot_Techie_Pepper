2006-03-10T15:38:00.000Z	cppnewbie		how do i UNMOUNT whats in mnt now? :S
2006-03-10T15:39:00.000Z	cppnewbie		umount: directory/file : not mounted <-- wtf
2006-03-10T15:40:00.000Z	cppnewbie		not an sda, its an iso i mounted on /mnt/
2006-03-10T15:40:00.000Z	cppnewbie		ya
2006-03-10T15:42:00.000Z	cppnewbie		ugh my head... all these parameters and this hassle.... seems like i shouldve stayed on windows lol :P although linux offers increased capability now i cant understand stuff thats fundamental :'( so i cant umount /mnt/ why is that? :S
2006-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	me2win	cppnewbie	did you mount something on /mnt?
2006-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	cppnewbie		yea me2win
2006-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	cppnewbie		but now it says device busy or something and im not using it anywhere
2006-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	me2win		you probably mounted something on /mnt/something
2006-03-10T15:43:00.000Z	me2win		but not /mnt
2006-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	cppnewbie		not really, when i cd to mnt theres the thing i mounted w00t :D
2006-03-10T15:44:00.000Z	cppnewbie		never tried
2006-03-10T15:45:00.000Z	cppnewbie		ah got it
2006-03-10T15:45:00.000Z	cppnewbie		it was simply sudo umount /mnt/ lol :D
2006-03-10T15:49:00.000Z	cppnewbie	LjL	in that mswindows partition stuff it only says stuff about fat16|32 , ntfs and apple partitions. no fat alone
2006-03-10T15:51:00.000Z	cppnewbie		how is fat filesystem called in linux? vfat or vfat is another thing? :S
2006-03-10T15:51:00.000Z	cppnewbie		aha
2006-03-10T15:52:00.000Z	cppnewbie		--->/media/sdc1 is not a block device <--- what does this mean? :S
2006-03-10T15:53:00.000Z	cppnewbie		aha
2006-03-10T15:55:00.000Z	cppnewbie		is vfat a readonly filesystem? :S
2006-03-10T15:56:00.000Z	cppnewbie		i didnt tell it to be, how can i... "untell" it? :S :p
2006-03-10T15:57:00.000Z	cppnewbie		so how can i mount it as not read only? thats my prob
2006-03-10T15:57:00.000Z	me2win	cppnewbie	hold while i get you the page
