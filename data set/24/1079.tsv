2012-04-18T23:40:00.000Z	shpngld		Hello everybody! I will be really happy if someone helps me! Im using xubuntu11 04. The web browser I use is Chromium, my torrent client is Flush and listen to Music with VLC player. quite often I got a problem while browsing : Error 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED): Unable to resolve the server's DNS address." In the same time the Online radio I usually enjoy doesnt stops and the stream is OK. The torrent transfer r OK t
2012-04-18T23:40:00.000Z	shpngld		oo.... no problems...but the browsing is failing..I have to wait for a few minutes sometimes, then F5 and eventually all seems back to normal...for a while...What can I do to fix the problem?
2012-04-18T23:40:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	slow down your torrents
2012-04-18T23:41:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	if you use a consumer router perhaps it is having trouble with all the streams from the torrent client, causing DNS to fail while not impacting existing connections
2012-04-18T23:42:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 so i should stop usin torrents?
2012-04-18T23:44:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	I think this is the problem, when i quit rush all seems ok...but what if I want to dl/ul torrnets
2012-04-18T23:44:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	"FLUSH" I ment
2012-04-18T23:44:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	I am not familiar with that client, but there should be an option to limit the number of connections
2012-04-18T23:44:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 what is a good number of connection for you
2012-04-18T23:45:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	don't ask me, I have dual core machine with 8 GiB of RAM for my router
2012-04-18T23:45:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	and a 50 mbit cable connection
2012-04-18T23:46:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 well I can divide it by 20 then...
2012-04-18T23:46:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	You might just try limiting the speed
2012-04-18T23:46:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	Thanks A Lot I will do it tight now
2012-04-18T23:46:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	generally start with really low numbers, then do gradual increases until you see a failure
2012-04-18T23:47:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 Thats a good approach thjanks
2012-04-18T23:47:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	np
2012-04-18T23:48:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	if you want to get crazy check out the linux advanced routing and traffic shaping guide: http://lartc.org.  They have examples for protecting your connection from getting flooded.
2012-04-18T23:53:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 Thanks a lot for every thing, I m quite new at xubuntu, Ill take a look at it
2012-04-18T23:55:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	another ? : what is the ususal reason for slow animations gifs or slow utube videos in web browser?
2012-04-18T23:57:00.000Z	meganerd	shpngld	no idea.  slow computer or no video drivers installed?
2012-04-18T23:59:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 I can watch nicely .avi but every animation in web browser is at least choppy...RAM is almost 1gb and Mhz are 1.7
2012-04-18T23:59:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	Ghz I ment
2012-04-19T00:00:00.000Z	shpngld	meganerd	 Is it possible to be something about Flash?
