2008-08-27T22:53:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	I already asked
2008-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	They get angry when I ask the same question again & again.
2008-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	then check out the patience factoid.  You should just repeat your question after a few minutes
2008-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	Hello, years ago when I used Windows I installed a freeware virtual printer with ghostscript at it's core. This VP allowed me to not only print to PDF but also que print jobs up so that I could later merge them into one pdf document. Now is there any way that I can make a VP on linux give me the option to merge print jobs?
2008-08-27T22:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	its ok, just dont ask too often.  The point is, if no one knows the answer, then they won't say anything.  They arent ignoring you
2008-08-27T22:55:00.000Z	holyguyver		Well danbhfive can you help me then?
2008-08-27T22:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	I have no clue, have you checked google?
2008-08-27T22:55:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	Yes I have
2008-08-27T22:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	all you want to do is merge a pdf file?
2008-08-27T22:56:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	No
2008-08-27T22:56:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	 I can already do that
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	What I want to do is merge print jobs before they are ever printed.
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	then, you want to be able to print to pdf?
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	 no
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	I can already print to pdfs
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	I can already print to pdf & I can already merge pdfs
2008-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	why do you need the merge to happen before the pdf generation?
2008-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	It is called simplicity & ease of use.
2008-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	as said I had a print driver in windows called PDF Creator which could do it, & it could also change other facters as well, so all I am asking for is a VP that gives me lots of options when it comes to my print job.
2008-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	I cant find it, I guess it doesn't exist.  Maybe you could file a feature request
2008-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	holyguyver	danbhfive	 show me how to file one & I shall.
2008-08-27T23:05:00.000Z	danbhfive	holyguyver	I think you file a bug here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/system-config-printer        BUT, I have no idea how much luck you will have
