2011-04-05T09:24:00.000Z	LittleZeasel	toad__	... http://www.linuxcommand.org/ ... while it might not give instant answers, it leads you step by step through all terminal commands and gives you ways to find stuff using the terminal ... A great starters guide that helped me a lot (shame that I won't be needing any longer, since my computer obviously doesn't work with Linux. Who'd have thunk it, a machine, not compatible with Linux ..)
2011-04-05T09:24:00.000Z	toad__		ok cool
2011-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	toad__		I've been looking for a good resource
2011-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	LittleZeasel		:) I like that resource ... would like it more, if I had a Linux to go with it :P
2011-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	toad__		but all the places I have tried have been very minimal and don't go into any detial or really explain anything, its all the basic commands like ls, cd, what '~' means etc..
2011-04-05T09:25:00.000Z	toad__		w7 isnt bad no
2011-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	toad__		it hasnt really given me much trouble, I always used osx before using windows, but have been rather familiar with it before, but now that I have ubuntu installed I probalby wont use win7 much more except for work
2011-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	toad__		I love photoshop far too much to give it up
2011-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	LittleZeasel		it's horrible when it comes to security and viruses :( ... tried to get a pc of a friend fixed and win7 didn't give me ANY controle whatsoever over changing/adding/removing files, etc.
2011-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	LittleZeasel		Pain in the neck ...
2011-04-05T09:26:00.000Z	LittleZeasel		Photoshop wouldn't work with Linux_
