2010-09-27T18:59:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	I'm Windows by habit
2010-09-27T18:57:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	I'm lazy :p
2010-09-27T18:57:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 well, not a good idea if there's important stuff on there!
2010-09-27T18:58:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 besides, that's so windows :)
2010-09-27T18:58:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	I would just backup -> reinstall
2010-09-27T18:58:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 that is a lot of work for a minor fix!
2010-09-27T18:59:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	I'm slowly learning the Ubuntu way
2010-09-27T18:59:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	I provided the best fix I know. Better to provide something then nothing :D
2010-09-27T18:59:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 reinstalling is rarely required. lots of people do it, but there's usually a fix.
2010-09-27T18:59:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	agreed
2010-09-27T19:00:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	if your not impatient
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	Granted I am being very presumptuous in my suggestion. b/c install/fully update for Ubuntu wx.yz is 30 minutes on my connection.
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	that would be an entire day in Windows Vista
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 yes, but you must add the backup/restore time.
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	good call
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	yes your correct
2010-09-27T19:02:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	being presump again b/c I have everything auto-backed up
2010-09-27T19:03:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 good for you!
2010-09-27T19:03:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	ty (blushing)
2010-09-27T19:03:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 i just worry that other users might have important stuff on their system that they forget, then lose.
2010-09-27T19:04:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	your right on so many fronts. My suggestion is suboptimal
2010-09-27T19:04:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	it is a "fix" vs. a solution
2010-09-27T19:05:00.000Z	bobstro	rusivi	 no big deal. lot of people just reinstall. i'm just pointing out that it is not needed most of the time.
2010-09-27T19:05:00.000Z	rusivi	bobstro	ty for doing so, challenging the community to solve problems instead of avoiding them is a good thing. Please do so in the future.
