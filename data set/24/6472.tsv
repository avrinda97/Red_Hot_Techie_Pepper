2005-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Now I'm confused...
2005-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	thats a good thing
2006-01-16T13:05:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	one at the tme
2006-01-16T13:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	Ick.
2006-01-16T13:06:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	what metapackage is it ?
2006-01-16T13:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop.  Thought I'd check them out, but definitely sticking with Gnome.
2006-01-16T13:08:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	sudo apt-get remove xfce4 kdelibs
2006-01-16T13:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	What about all of the extra programs they install with themselves?
2006-01-16T13:09:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	rightklik the package in synaptic and choose dependencies
2006-01-16T13:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	Will take a look at that.
2006-01-16T13:09:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	then you see all packages going with the metapack
2006-01-16T13:10:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	gnome wise choice :)
2006-01-16T13:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	Uh oh.  This list includes the things common with Gnome (of course), so I don't know how I'd sort that out.  apt-get needs an undo!
2006-01-16T13:12:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	the ones going with gnome also wil remove the uduntu-desktop matapack so check it out ;)
2006-01-16T13:14:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	after removing the debs you can always sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to restore the default gnome desktop
2006-01-16T13:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	Is that going to break/mangle anything?  (and why hasn't someone come up with a better way to do this yet?)
2006-01-16T13:15:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	to keep is simple I wuold remove qt it wil remove everything kde related and remove all packages starting with xfce4
2006-01-16T13:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	Which package would that be?
2006-01-16T13:17:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	do that first
2006-01-16T13:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	done.
2006-01-16T13:19:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	col :)
2006-01-16T13:20:00.000Z	deFrysk	tonyyarusso	for xfce4 I would simply uncheck all xcfe4-blah packages in synaptic and remove them
2006-01-16T13:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	deFrysk	This seems to be doing the trick.  Thanks.
