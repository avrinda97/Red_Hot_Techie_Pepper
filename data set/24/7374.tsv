2005-08-11T13:26:00.000Z	Amaranth		I'm not a die hard anything.
2005-08-11T13:26:00.000Z	Amaranth		I use Windows to play games, GNOME because it's easier, and Ubuntu because it does the hard stuff for me.
2005-08-11T13:27:00.000Z	Amaranth		If Windows was better at the things I like I'd switch back. If KDE was simpler than GNOME I'd jump, if I found something better than Ubuntu I'd be gone.
2005-08-11T13:29:00.000Z	Amaranth		nope
2005-08-11T13:29:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	huh? gnome3 is slated to be a drastic redesign (if they ever get the development running)
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	see project topaz
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	Nope, that's all crack that is basically never going to happen.
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	hmm. I've gotten the impression that jeff waugh really wants it to happen, in some form.
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	Jeff Waugh himself has said he doesn't want 3.0 to break everything.
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	Watch his GUADEC 6 keynote
2005-08-11T13:31:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	I'm talking about interface, nothing more. yes, I'm basing my opinion on that keynote. :)
2005-08-11T13:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	Most of the ideas presented are crack though.
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	hmm. which ones?
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	So why would we dump the setup we have now for a brittle layer over a complex system?
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	Every UI idea for 'GNOME 3.0' is total crack.
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	you disagree with the document centric worldview, then? :)
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	or just the interfaces designed for it thus far?
2005-08-11T13:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	A little of both.
2005-08-11T13:33:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	right. well, if people want to do it badly enough, it'll happen.
2005-08-11T13:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	It'll have to be a fork.
2005-08-11T13:33:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	yes.
2005-08-11T13:33:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	I'm just interested in new interface design. I don't consider gnome2 broken.
2005-08-11T13:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	wolverian	And it'll still throw away a good portion of what we have now.
2005-08-11T13:34:00.000Z	wolverian	Amaranth	that might be necessary, yes. but if the interface can be improved enough to make it worthwhile.. I don't see a problem. well, besides all the work that has to be done.
