2011-07-16T23:57:00.000Z	Boreeas		Hmm, I don't get the instructions in !java. The terminal switches to a ">" and then nothing happens. Could anyone help me with that?
2011-07-16T23:57:00.000Z	Boreeas		Basics, please, I just switched from Win7 to Ubuntu yesterday
2011-07-16T23:58:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	you are looking for the ppa for sun java?
2011-07-16T23:58:00.000Z	Boreeas		ppa?
2011-07-16T23:59:00.000Z	Boreeas		I need the jre and jvm from sun
2011-07-16T23:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	sorry, I don't know what you are trying to do

2011-07-17T00:09:00.000Z	Boreeas	ChogyDan	I did this, but java.com tells me that I only have v22, but I need v26
2011-07-17T00:11:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	use the ppa
2011-07-17T00:15:00.000Z	Boreeas	ChogyDan	"sun-java6-plugin is already the newest version."
2011-07-17T00:20:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	apt-cache policy sun-java6-jre
2011-07-17T00:20:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	maybe pastebin the output?  and quick, Im heading out
2011-07-17T00:21:00.000Z	Boreeas		Uh, second
2011-07-17T00:23:00.000Z	Boreeas	ChogyDan	http://pastebin.com/qbjqCsT2
2011-07-17T00:24:00.000Z	Boreeas		Wait a second
2011-07-17T00:24:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	well, it looks like you have it installed, the command I gave would confirm.  Make sure to remove icedtea java, and openjdk etc.     The alternatives stuff is a pain
2011-07-17T00:24:00.000Z	Boreeas		Do I need to restart the computer before it updates?
2011-07-17T00:25:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	you don't know what I mean by alternatives, but it is a pain, easier to remove
2011-07-17T00:25:00.000Z	Boreeas		How do I remove it?
2011-07-17T00:25:00.000Z	Boreeas		apt-remove?
2011-07-17T00:25:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Boreeas	sorry, gota run, maybe someone else can help, icedtea and openjdk
