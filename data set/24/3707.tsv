2008-03-23T08:20:00.000Z	Rubie		or point me to somewhere that could help
2008-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php  See if that helps ya
2008-03-23T08:41:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	So you're on the computer that you want to recover the password from, correct?  Are there any other wireless nodes on the network?
2008-03-23T08:42:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Is anything else connecting to the network wirelessly?  Computers, printers, xbox...etc?
2008-03-23T08:44:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Oh, I see.  I misunderstood your needs.  Try this instead then:  http://www.snapfiles.com/get/wirelesskeyview.html
2008-03-23T08:47:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	You need to convert it manually then...  This should help:   http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/wireless/networks/archives/converting-a-phrase-to-hex-for-a-wep-key-13024
2008-03-23T08:49:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	I know but ascii to hex conversion is the same, regardless of the protocol
2008-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	You used the converter that was linked in the article?
2008-03-23T09:01:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	I know that.. but ascii to hex (and vice versa) is the same, regardless.  Put the hex key that your program returns into this link.. select 'hex to ascii' and try the resulting output: http://centricle.com/tools/ascii-hex/
2008-03-23T09:05:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Hrm... and you're positive it's hex?
2008-03-23T09:07:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Try this one, maybe?  http://www.speedguide.net/wlan_key.php
2008-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Could the ascii key be in a language other than english?
2008-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Or do you use something other than Windows' "Wireless Zero Configuration" utility to connect?  The software that came with the wireless adapter perhaps?
2008-03-23T09:26:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Well, if the computer you're on is the only thing that is connected to your router or WAP, then what about resetting it to factory defaults, then creating a new key?
2008-03-23T09:28:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Ahh.. Ok... But you can do what you wish with the computer that you're on now?
2008-03-23T09:30:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	That's not what I meant... What I meant is, you're free to install software on the system you're on now, without getting into trouble?
2008-03-23T09:32:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Ok.. This is the best I can think.  Try reading through this and doing as it says...http://www.grape-info.com/doc/win2000srv/security/aircrack-2.3.html
2008-03-23T09:33:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	What we're looking to do here is run aircrack, then disconnect from the network, and reconnect to it again with aircrack running in the background.  That should allow it to find the key and then decrypt it for you.
2008-03-23T09:34:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Not sure if you can run it on the same computer that you're sniffing.. but it's all I can think.. and I don' thave a windows computer to test it with.
2008-03-23T09:35:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Well, if this works, write it down in a safe place for him and for you.. heh
2008-03-23T09:41:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	The readme.html doesn't tell you how?
2008-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	Rubie	Well, you knew that part already :)  Hrm.. Yeah, I have no other ideas for you... sorry.
