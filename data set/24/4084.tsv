2007-07-18T07:50:00.000Z	Seoke		Is there a way to change the color of the title bar at the top of the windows?
2007-07-18T07:51:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	check out http://gnome-look.org/ and look at the metacity link.. there are plenty of themes to choose from
2007-07-18T08:18:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	beryl, compiz, compiz-fusion =, ubuntu "desktop effects"
2007-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	do u do any gaming??
2007-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	Yup that was the only downfall I'm looking for a decent game for linux to play now... I reinstalled americas army xD but I'm looking for something better.. any suggestiosn?
2007-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	nup.. apart from the ols school games and snes / nes emulators... no.. cant really recommend any thing for linux (unless u like any of the quake / doom variants)
2007-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	I tried installing Unreal Tournament but it wouldnt install it just said something like "Bad trap"
2007-07-18T08:26:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	yea i leave my deesktop for gaming (with windows) but use my lappy for everything else (and am now dedicated to linux on here) mind u it has recindled a love of emulators..
2007-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	Emulators rock xD Yeah I'm straight linux now I need to start learning command lines again =x I havent used linux for like 3 years
2007-07-18T08:28:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	yea.. was always weary of the command line.. till i stared using my lappy mouse is evil.. command line to some extent all the way..
2007-07-18T08:30:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	yea.. my command line is very basic.. do really need to get into more "scrpting" type stuff.. manly cause some of my stuff wont ork at startup..
2007-07-18T08:31:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	that sucks >_< Right now for scripting I think I'm going to start working on learning python... I used to use Turbo Delphi but thats not an option for linux ._.
2007-07-18T08:33:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	ye.. i have the problem of really bad CPU scaling support and underclocking my vid card for battery.. all of which can be done from the command line (a group of about 5 ish commands.. but i dont want to have to do that every time i start the comp..
2007-07-18T08:33:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	Cant you create a file that will run the scripts for you just by double clicking it?
2007-07-18T08:33:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	.bin?
2007-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	yea that is where i get stuck.. how does one go about doin that??
2007-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	I'm not sure but I was actually looking into learning and I'm a quick learner so when I do I can tell you =P
2007-07-18T08:35:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	lol.... yea.. i will look also im pretty sure it is easy.. ust cant rem how to do it..
2007-07-18T08:35:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	I think its just like programming open a text editor, write the command lines, and save it as a .bin but it cant be that easy xD
2007-07-18T08:36:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	yea.. it is close though.. open text editor, add a line of text describing shell.. input commands.. then save it as bin (i think from what i have bin able to put together)
2007-07-18T08:36:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	I'm on forums looking up info right now
2007-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	ryuk	Seoke	lol.. i was about to put a post up
2007-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	xD Just do a search =P
2007-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	Seoke	ryuk	Still no luck here >_<
