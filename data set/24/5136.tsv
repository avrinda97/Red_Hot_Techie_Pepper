2007-03-05T10:11:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	me needs root  :)
2007-03-05T10:12:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	actually its mortici that needs it
2007-03-05T10:13:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	for getting back his sudo..i already suggested booting off liveCD and repair it from there
2007-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	isn't that the same as /127.0.0.1 and there is no /127.0.0.1 file so it would fail?
2007-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	yep it failed on mine..but it worked on file:///   i dont know why yet
2007-08-18T10:19:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	not bright to have it mount in /mnt, best to have it mount in a subdirectory of /mnt, but if there is only one drive I guess it doesn't technically matter
2007-08-18T10:26:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	but he might need wtmp and utmp files
2007-08-18T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	nah
2007-08-18T11:14:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	per his post of the /etc/fstab  he has that /dev/sdb1 as ro only
2007-08-18T11:15:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	those is on error, that shouldn't happen, also it wouldn't allow you to write the stuff to begin with
2007-08-18T11:16:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	you're right..i mis-read
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	web configuration doesn't work do to their being no root account iirc
2007-08-22T09:31:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	they have to run lpasswd or something like that to add a cups user
2007-08-24T05:00:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	are you using breezy?
2007-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	no, but i was able to use that repository on my dapper..
2007-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	that was pretty stupid of you
2007-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	i didnt expect java to be dependent on specific ubuntu distro libraries
2007-08-24T05:02:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	java is in the ubuntu repos
2007-08-24T05:02:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	probably now, i dont recall when i have to add that source to download  java 1.5 then
2007-08-24T05:02:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	it was already in dapper
2007-08-24T05:03:00.000Z	bulmer	bruenig	but it may not have been 1.5 it may have been 1.4..its been a while since i downloaded java..i cant recall exactly
2007-08-24T05:04:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	no it was 5
2007-11-25T22:41:00.000Z	bruenig	bulmer	single user mode just puts you in a root console from init
