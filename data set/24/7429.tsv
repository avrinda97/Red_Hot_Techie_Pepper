2009-01-23T10:57:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	you can also use apt-cache search
2009-01-23T10:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	to find a package, for example, apt-cache search php5
2009-01-23T10:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	will find all the php5 related packages, installed or not
2009-01-23T10:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	take a shot at adding the backports to sources.list, there may be an update from jaunty perhaps?  (i don't know)
2009-01-23T11:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	you could also check the launchpad.net PPA's to see if someone packaged a later version for ubuntu
2009-01-23T11:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	check the PPA's first!
2009-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	i'm gonna give you a link in a second, which you can use to search, but my internet is slow, so it will take a sec.
2009-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas
2009-01-23T11:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	so, for example, this is what php5-gd came up with https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?name_filter=php5-gd
2009-01-23T11:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	did that help?
2009-01-23T11:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	depends on the dependencies of the actual .deb's, so i don't know ;)
2009-01-23T11:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	hey
2009-01-23T11:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	that's a matter i cannot solve, reluctantly.
2009-01-23T11:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	jgreen	your only other option is probably installing the whole mess from source
