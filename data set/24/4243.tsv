2007-05-31T16:03:00.000Z	virgil		does anyone know how i could maybe get around this error "ould not open 'cedega_small_6.0_all.deb' The package might be corrupted or you are not allowed to open the file. Check the permissions of the file."
2007-05-31T16:03:00.000Z	virgil		Could*
2007-05-31T16:03:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	You could check the permissions of the file ;) Do an: ls -l ced
2007-05-31T16:04:00.000Z	virgil		in the permissions i am set as the owner and read write able
2007-05-31T16:04:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	ls: ced: No such file or directory
2007-05-31T16:04:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	I see. What did you try to do with that deb? Did you try with: sudo dpkg -i cedega_small_6.0_all.deb using the terminal?
2007-05-31T16:05:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	originally i just tried double clicking it, and it was working fine until i decided to click "terminal" under the install bar, that's when everything froze and all these problems arose
2007-05-31T16:05:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	I don't know what you mean. I never used the graphical deb installer. Let me take you another way ;)
2007-05-31T16:05:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	GNOME or KDE?
2007-05-31T16:06:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	ubuntu feisty 7.04, i think i'm running gnome with XGL right now
2007-05-31T16:06:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	okie. Do an Alt+F2, and write gnome-terminal in the thing that pops
2007-05-31T16:06:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	done
2007-05-31T16:07:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	ok now get to the directory with the .deb file. YOu know how to move within a terminal?
2007-05-31T16:07:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	yes, i do =]  and i am now there (Desktop)
2007-05-31T16:08:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	Awesome. Do a: sudo dpkg -i cedega_small_6.0_all.deb
2007-05-31T16:09:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	the last thing i saw was "Setting up cedega-small (6.0) ..." i'm now back at the command line
2007-05-31T16:10:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	So the output was _only_: Setting up cedega small (6.0)...  ? :/
2007-05-31T16:10:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	you fixed it, i love you, all glory to you
2007-05-31T16:10:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	yes, but i think that means it worked. i can now access package managers/update managers and i am getting no further errors
2007-05-31T16:10:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	I see. Sorry for not beeing able to help you with your GUI app. Try using the terminal from here and on, it's faster and safer ;)
2007-05-31T16:11:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	if you want more info about that dpkg command, try man dpkg
2007-05-31T16:11:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	thank you very much, i'll slowly get into it, it's hard learning all these commands
2007-05-31T16:11:00.000Z	virgil	habeeb	gotcha, thanks again man
2007-05-31T16:11:00.000Z	habeeb	virgil	no problem. have fun
