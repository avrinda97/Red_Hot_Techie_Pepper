2009-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	no idea, from that code it wouldn't also need no sudo for echo
2009-12-17T08:51:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	thanks all the same
2009-12-17T08:51:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	end it with exit 0
2009-12-17T08:52:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	no diff with exit 0
2009-12-17T08:54:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	wrong place here ; paste the whole script
2009-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/343265/
2009-12-17T08:57:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	i think it was the echo function repeating,
2009-12-17T08:57:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	insert first line : #!/bin/bash          , and #bash for further resarches
2009-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	cheers, i had the bach remark i just didnt pastebin it
2009-12-17T08:58:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	then sudo chown UserName blah.sh  and sudo chmod +x blah.sh
2010-02-17T07:04:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	/etc/default/grub, mainly
2010-02-17T07:05:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	depends on what you want to change /achieve
2010-02-17T07:06:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	i want to change from uuid to dev or label, as i are migrating an image to a new system
2010-02-17T07:06:00.000Z	DasEi	koshari	uuids are much safer, as they will always be the same
2010-02-17T07:08:00.000Z	koshari	DasEi	they wont be the same on different hardware thats the problem, i want to place the same image on 4 identical machines,
