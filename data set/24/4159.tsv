2008-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	Bllz		when i go to check the boxes for a directory's permissions, the first click on a blank box is a dash (-) ... clicking it again is yields a check.  What's the difference?
2008-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	Bllz		what's the difference between a dash and a check in a checkbox?

2008-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 thanks, but meant the tick/check in the file permissions of a folder
2008-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 any idea?
2008-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	not sure, really.. I've wondered that too- what are the octal permissions that correspond to the same file?
2008-06-04T10:21:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 not sure what octal permissions are
2008-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	oops, sorry- it says "Text view:" and then something like -rw-r--r--
2008-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 mine say drwxrwxr-x
2008-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	perhaps the dash means that files underneath that directory have different permissions
2008-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	namely, differing in the bit that's a dash ;)
2008-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 that would actually make sense... okay! thanks!  I'm surprised I didn't surmize that from the link you sent me... oh my... it's late lol
2008-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	no problem :)
2008-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 now if i set permissions to read, that means someone can copy the file to their own directory right?
2008-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	right,
2008-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 sorry, read-only
2008-06-04T10:27:00.000Z	troxor	Bllz	System->Administration->Users and Groups
2008-06-04T10:27:00.000Z	Bllz	troxor	 thanks yet again =)
