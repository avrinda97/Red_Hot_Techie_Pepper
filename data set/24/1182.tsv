2010-05-26T17:42:00.000Z	Gump_lucid		night_elf: i've seen several posts on various forums with this problem, all seem to be related to grub-grub2 or linux update
2010-05-26T17:42:00.000Z	Gump_lucid		but no solutions...
2010-05-26T17:43:00.000Z	Gump_lucid		got it. thanks for the help night_elf
2010-05-26T17:44:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	i still be lost with grub2 grub was so easy to config :)
2010-05-26T17:44:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	why did you upgrade to grub2?
2010-05-26T17:46:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	i did not upgrade to grub2 it is the default one on lucid, just i upgrade the config to see my ancient karmic
2010-05-26T17:47:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	hmmm. my problems started when i upgraded to lucid, but my system still has grub legacy on it
2010-05-26T17:48:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	it looks like i am. has a grub.cfg and everything. but it still says grub legacy
2010-05-26T17:53:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	yes
2010-05-26T17:55:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	i will try the idea of wildcat_laptop complete reinstall of grub
2010-05-26T17:55:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	let me know how it goes, if it works i will do it
2010-05-26T18:05:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	wat
2010-05-26T18:05:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	you said install is finished and you are restarting..i think? lol

2010-05-26T18:36:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	i had all but given up hope!
2010-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	damn. well...
2010-05-26T18:38:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	looks like i'm just gonna erase my disk entirely and start with a fresh lucid install
2010-05-26T18:39:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	i am sad to say it will not resolve anything looks like a bug
2010-05-26T18:40:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	so basically then...you're saying grub2+windows=no go?
2010-05-26T18:44:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	i mistaked in your nick
2010-05-26T18:47:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	nothing that will be of use to either of us
2010-05-26T18:48:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	try grub to replace grub2, a good option i think
2010-05-26T18:49:00.000Z	yoritomo	Gump_lucid	yes but as i am doing some trial i may be offline sometime
2010-05-26T18:49:00.000Z	Gump_lucid	yoritomo	well, hopefully we will run into each other some time today or tomorrow
