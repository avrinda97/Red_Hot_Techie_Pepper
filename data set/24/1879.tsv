2010-10-27T18:23:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	man mplayer to see how to enter lame and lame options
2010-10-27T18:29:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	 I need to use ffmpeg and cant find any info about lame in there.  basically i just need the name of the mp3 audio encoder.  dont know why 'lame' wont work though.
2010-10-27T18:45:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	try it without -acodec mp3, then after that doesnt work try -f mp3
2010-10-27T18:48:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	I did ffmpeg -i FILE -f mp3 FILE  and it said 'codec id 86017 not found for output stream'.  im a noob at video encoding sorry
2010-10-27T18:50:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	see if it includes mp3 on the list: ffmpeg -formats
2010-10-27T18:52:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	I have kubuntu-restricted-extras installed, and mp3 is on the list of supported formats from -formats.  that is why i am rather confused
2010-10-27T18:55:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	strange.....
2010-10-27T18:57:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	are you able to play mp3's
2010-10-27T18:58:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	yes to both, all my codec seem to be installed, I can encode mp3 also (have done it) but not sure if the encoder was ffmpeg or not.  im gonna give mencoder a shot one sec
2010-10-27T19:00:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	mencoder wouldn't do it either, but it is encoding with mp2 fine right now
2010-10-27T19:01:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	ffmpeg encodes with mp2 as well
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	ffmpeg can supposibly encode mp2, and decode and encode mp3 according to -formats
2010-10-27T19:02:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	hmm ever reinstall stuff?
2010-10-27T19:03:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	such as?
2010-10-27T19:03:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	i was thinking uninstall the restricted then put it back in
2010-10-27T19:04:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	you ARE in kubuntu right?
2010-10-27T19:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	yeah, ill give it a shot, but dont think it will do anything
2010-10-27T19:05:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	did you try also in #kubuntu or am i looking at a mirrored channel =)
2010-10-27T19:05:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	no I didn't try in kubuntu as this is more of a generic issue.  they usually arent as helpful as the people in here :)
2010-10-27T19:06:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	but this time, see if anything is indicated in the log
2010-10-27T19:07:00.000Z	she_dyed	nerdy_kid	if you can run command line apt-get or something
2010-10-27T19:09:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	it reinstalled fine.  idk, maybe ill make a post on the forums about it
2010-10-27T19:09:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	thanks for your help
2010-10-27T19:10:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	she_dyed	lol
