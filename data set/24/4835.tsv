2007-01-03T09:48:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	sorry i havent followed.  what chipset are you trying to get working ?
2007-01-03T09:48:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	the hp 9008 laptop it has the mc51
2007-01-03T09:50:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	hmm... mc51 is that the name of the north brdige or the south bridge?  or is that the whole chipset (northbridge+southbridge on one die)?
2007-01-03T09:50:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	its the nvidia chipset, let me check again to make double sure,,,,thanks
2007-01-03T09:53:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	its the nvidia mcp51
2007-01-03T09:57:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	weird, i think mcp51 is just the south bridge ? im not sure
2007-01-03T09:58:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	well what types of problems are you having?
2007-01-03T09:59:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	the video card and wlan are not recognised and no matter what im doing i cant get linux to accept the nvidia drivers...
2007-01-03T09:59:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	are they even listed in lspci
2007-01-03T10:03:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	that is pretty odd.  sorry im not sure where to go from there
2007-01-03T10:04:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	sure you can try it.
2007-01-03T10:05:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	it doesnt change your bios.  noapic acpi=off cant cause damage and i doubt itll cause any software issues if u boot up the next time without it.  its just a debugging option that u pass to the kernel
2007-01-03T10:06:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	and i would put those option in the kernel line of the boot file?
2007-01-03T10:07:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	yes, google acpi=off noapic for an example, youll see where people put it
2007-01-03T10:07:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	but actually dont put it in the grub config yet
2007-01-03T10:08:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	you can specify it when you boot up.  its like a safe mode, except you can edit the parameters on boot up.  just add noapic acpi=off to the kernel command line ( i think u press E on the grub screen to edit the line, or something)
2007-01-03T15:34:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	thanks for your help last night
2007-01-03T15:35:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	no problem, pretty sure u can enable PNP OS in bios for linux tho, i dont even know what the diff is, i wouldnt touch it unless ur having issues
2007-01-03T15:39:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	does it matter that the broadcom driver for windows has been updated? there is a new one on the hp site i noticed
2007-01-03T15:39:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	um i dont know.  ndis wrapper extracts firmware from the windows ones so that in turn could be an update for linux
2007-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	if i change a setting in boot options does linux automatically recognise the new hardware? it doesnt pop up and tell you there is new hardware, right/
2007-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	xtknight	val__	setting in boot options? what do you mean... linux doesnt scream at you like windows does but you can see the hw detected at boot up in dmesg
2007-01-03T15:46:00.000Z	val__	xtknight	i meant in dmesg i didnt know to check that
