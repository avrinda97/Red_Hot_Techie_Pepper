2010-12-17T19:42:00.000Z	macsmister		I can't seem to install ie6 successfully using winetricks in lucid. Can anyone help me?
2010-12-17T19:43:00.000Z	pingoo	macsmister	try http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page
2010-12-17T19:44:00.000Z	macsmister	pingoo	tried that too, didn't work either.
2010-12-17T19:44:00.000Z	pingoo		did u try playonlinux?
2010-12-17T19:44:00.000Z	macsmister		seems like some key files that need to download from MS site aren't available anymore....
2010-12-17T19:44:00.000Z	macsmister	pingoo	no I sure didn't.
2010-12-17T19:45:00.000Z	pingoo		ohh ok.. I'm not sure about the files missing from MS site, but may be you can try playonlinux
2010-12-17T19:45:00.000Z	macsmister		says: "setup was unable to download the required components. please make sure you are connected to the internet, or try to run setup again later."
2010-12-17T19:46:00.000Z	pingoo		hmm
2010-12-17T19:46:00.000Z	macsmister		ok pingoo
2010-12-17T19:46:00.000Z	macsmister	pingoo	the message was from a windows update IE box.
2010-12-17T19:47:00.000Z	pingoo		ok.. in that case, may be those files are really missing from the MS server or may be the server is down temporarily
2010-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	macsmister	pingoo	didn't work yesterday either.
2010-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	pingoo		ohh
2010-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	macsmister		that's not good, I really need ie6 installed bad or else I'm gonna have to use windows instead.
2010-12-17T19:48:00.000Z	macsmister		grrrrrrrrr
2010-12-17T19:49:00.000Z	macsmister		installing playonlinux. we'll see what happens there.
2010-12-17T19:49:00.000Z	pingoo		yeah it knows which version of wine to use for which windows application
2010-12-17T19:50:00.000Z	macsmister		cool thanks pingoo
2010-12-17T19:50:00.000Z	pingoo		ok all the best!
2010-12-17T19:50:00.000Z	pingoo		If you have a windows license, then try using Oracle's VirtualBox
2010-12-17T19:51:00.000Z	pingoo		in which case, you do not need to leave Linux.
2010-12-17T19:51:00.000Z	pingoo		both work in tandem
2010-12-17T19:51:00.000Z	macsmister	pingoo	the reason I want to use wine is to remove complexity. I'm getting laptops ready for people in the field.
