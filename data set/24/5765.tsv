2006-05-17T05:46:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	iirc there's a fairly experimental USB QoS option in the kernel configuration
2006-05-17T05:46:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	not sure where you can get the user-space tools from (if it's even turned on in the ubuntu kernels)
2006-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	it wouldn't be unusual for it to be using a USB bus (look in BIOS)
2006-05-19T06:11:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	the .xsession-errors log says /etc/gdm/Xsession: Beginning session setup...
2006-05-19T06:11:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	I guess it's that mkdtemp failing that's the problem.  what runs that?
2006-05-19T06:22:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	what's an RFE?
2006-05-19T06:23:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	Request for Enhancement
2006-05-19T06:24:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	oh, I see.
2006-05-19T06:25:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	I once had breezy delete itself when I booted due to /tmp having a 'bind mount' in it.
2006-05-19T06:25:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	I think a little /tmp-sanity-checking would be a good thing.
2006-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	erk :/ that's a little crazy - yeah, probably best to assimilate it from another distro too
2006-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	I had the whole of / bound to a mountpoint /tmp/root
2006-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	man :/ that's a nasty malfunction
2006-06-09T06:11:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	example I just ran in to, seen it all over in the 'SEE ALSO' sections though
2006-06-09T06:10:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	such as?
2006-06-09T06:10:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	debconf, dpkg-reconfigure reference debconf(7)
2006-06-09T06:11:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	/usr/share/man/man7/debconf.7.gz is in package debconf-doc
2006-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	the man pages are often not required by the packages they document.  don't know why.
2006-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	thanks - I guess this can't be helped
2006-06-09T06:12:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	well, it could be - the package could depend upon its documentation package...
2006-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	discover "apt-file" - it's useful for finding man pages and other files.
2006-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	true, but it's so obvious, there has to be a good reason why it doesn't :/
2006-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	dooglus	RandolphCarter	I did "apt-file search debconf | grep 7" to find that
2006-06-09T06:13:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	dooglus	cheers, I'll remember that one
