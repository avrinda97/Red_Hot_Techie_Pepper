2009-08-16T07:42:00.000Z	MindSpark		hi, for some reason my laptop doesn't change frequencies to the maximum
2009-08-16T07:42:00.000Z	MindSpark		it goes to 600mhz max although the actual max is 1.6gh
2009-08-16T07:43:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	what are you using to determine the current processor state/speed?
2009-08-16T07:43:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	a gnome applet
2009-08-16T07:44:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	actually an xfce applet
2009-08-16T07:44:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	I have sometimes found those to be less than accurate; you might try downloding powertop and seeing if you can confirm that it's not working correctly.
2009-08-16T07:46:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	powernowd:   cpu0: 75Mhz - 600Mhz (8 steps)
2009-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	that sounds like a BIOS configuration problem to me; did you recently install new memory, upgrade the BIOS firmware, or change BIOS settings?
2009-08-16T07:48:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	no
2009-08-16T07:51:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	the way both the ratios are multiplied by 3/8 suggests that the clock settings for the CPU are off for some reason.
2009-08-16T07:52:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	what does this mean ?
2009-08-16T07:54:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	Basically, the clock speed of the processor is dependent on subdividing a signal sent out from a quartz oscillator. If that gets misconfigured somehow (typically in BIOS settings), the processor will run at lower speeds.
2009-08-16T07:55:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	I am thinking this might be set low when the laptop is on battery ?
2009-08-16T07:55:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	I've not seen a laptop thus configured before.
2009-08-16T07:56:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	yea, back when I used slackware I had to patch the kernel so it would run my processor
2009-08-16T07:57:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	Using slackware, you encountered the same problem unless you patched the kernel?
2009-08-16T07:58:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	I had to patch the kernel so it would run the speedstepping. But that was maybe 7 years ago or so
2009-08-16T07:59:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	Not really my area of expertise, but the problem you're encountering now doesn't sound like it would be caused by the Linux kernel.
2009-08-16T07:59:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	ok, thanks, any tips on what to google for ?
2009-08-16T07:59:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	Do you happen to have something like a LiveCD of another distro or some way to try and determine if it's Ubuntu or hardware-related?
2009-08-16T08:00:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	right, good idea actually, but I am not sure if the cpu frequency scaling apps are on the liveCD
2009-08-16T08:01:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	I know that freq scaling worked for me on the latest Ubuntu LiveCD, can't speak for others.
2009-08-16T08:01:00.000Z	MindSpark	sevodnya	alright, thanks, I'll give that a shot
2009-08-16T08:02:00.000Z	sevodnya	MindSpark	np
