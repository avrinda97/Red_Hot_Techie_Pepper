2006-12-11T09:13:00.000Z	webben		Does anyone know why the spelling checker used by gedit complains about "shouldn't"
2006-12-11T09:13:00.000Z	webben		and if there's any way to teach it to understand the use of the apostrophe
2006-12-11T09:13:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	because it's poor english.
2006-12-11T09:14:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	only in some contexts.
2006-12-11T09:14:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	it's certainly not misspelled English.
2006-12-11T09:21:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	just out of curiousity.. why spell-check in gedit?   idk what it uses though, probably just the gnu spellcheck library.
2006-12-11T09:22:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	because I'm writing in gedit.
2006-12-11T09:22:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	and regardless of whether I use it or not, it's a clear bug.
2006-12-11T09:22:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	why?  just add it to your dictionary :)
2006-12-11T09:23:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	that shouldn't be necessary.
2006-12-11T09:23:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	it's quite ordinary English
2006-12-11T09:23:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	*shrug* I really do suppose that depends on where you come from.
2006-12-11T09:25:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	to answer your question, it uses the aspell library for spellcheck.
2006-12-11T09:26:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	It doesn't really depend where you come from. Contractions are not a spelling error. They may be inappropriate style in some instances.
2006-12-11T09:39:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	hmm, you probably are right that it's a bug.  you might consider submitting it with aspell.  "shouldn't" is already in the American English dictionary and it is the only contraction that appears to cause a spellcheck error.
2006-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	What's particularly interesting is that you "fix" it and end up with "shouldn't't"  lol
2006-12-11T09:40:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	which of course ends up being "wrongly" spelled ;)
2006-12-11T09:41:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	the issue though isn't the word, it's the single-quote barrier that apperas to be the issue.
2006-12-11T09:44:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	yes using aspell at the command line with en_GB and input "shouldn't shouldnt can't cant" only "shouldnt" is marked as being spelled incorrectly
2006-12-11T09:46:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	hmm but in gedit "shouldn't shouldnt can't cant" both shouldn'ts are marked as incorrectly spelled
2006-12-11T09:47:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	they are, and if you "fix" them you'll find "shouldn" can be replaced with "shouldn't" leaving you with "shouldn't't"
2006-12-11T09:47:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	which of course, "shouldn't't" will be marked as incorrectly spelled, lol.  It appears to only be that word though, which is why I'm with you on the belief that it's a flaw with ASpell.
2006-12-11T09:48:00.000Z	webben	ThePub	well, I think there's a problem with Aspell /and/ a different problem with gedit. Because otherwise I can't explain the difference between the two.
2006-12-11T09:50:00.000Z	ThePub	webben	oh, interesting.  I see what you're saying. Interesting.
