2008-01-07T10:26:00.000Z	matkix		How do you manage themes with Compiz? I'm new to it... I use to use beryl
2008-01-07T10:28:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	you have system > prefs > emerald theme manager? if not install emerald
2008-01-07T10:31:00.000Z	matkix	tanath	I installed emerald and imported my theme... now do I need to set up emerald to run or something so that my theme will take effect?
2008-01-07T10:31:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	been a while... i believe it automatically uses it... try and see
2008-01-07T10:31:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	run 'compiz --replace'
2008-01-07T10:32:00.000Z	matkix	tanath	that did it... now how do I get it to keep that setting so when i reboot it all stays as it.
2008-01-07T10:33:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	compiz should automatically use that theme now. all you need to do is make sure compiz runs when you log in
2008-01-07T10:33:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	just add it to your session (system > prefs > sessions)
2008-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	matkix	tanath	wow... I think that theme just made something crash I have no window manager now.
2008-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	if it's not in your session, add compiz with the 'compiz --replace' command
2008-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	ah, the window decoration thing. i've seen that before
2008-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	matkix	tanath	 The only thing I can see is irc and I can't get to the desktop
2008-01-07T10:35:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	press alt+f2 and run 'compiz --replace'
2008-01-07T10:35:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	if that doesn't work, run 'metacity --replace'
2008-01-07T10:35:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	then, i'd suggest enabling the crash handler plugin in compiz prefs, and setting it to do that automatically if it crashes
2008-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	note, it's not ALT, then F2. you hold alt and tap f2
2008-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	can you go to System > prefs> adv desktop effects ?
2008-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	you can't see the gnome panel at the top of the screen?
2008-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	does xchat have the title bar at the top?
2008-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	ok, then your window manager is running, it's the gnome panel that crashed
2008-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	oh
2008-01-07T10:39:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	so xchat is full screen then?
2008-01-07T10:39:00.000Z	matkix	tanath	yep
2008-01-07T10:41:00.000Z	tanath	matkix	you're gonna have to log out and back in again. close xchat and see if you can see the gnome panel to log out. if not, press ctrl+alt, backspace. that will kill x and any GUI apps running dropping you back at the login screen
