2008-10-22T01:34:00.000Z	_mora		Firefox can't resolve DNS (although it seems that some other apps - like ping - can) and ifup says that the interface eth0 is unknown.  ifconfig reports that eth0 exists, however.
2008-10-22T01:35:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	if the interface exists and no ip is attached to it, and no default route is set, and your /etc/resolv.conf doesn't have any dns servers, then yes, firefox is operating as it should
2008-10-22T01:36:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	resolv.conf does indeed have dns nameservers.
2008-10-22T01:36:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	can you ping them?
2008-10-22T01:37:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	yes.  I can also view some sites by domain name, but only after I load them by IP.
2008-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	what happens if you click on the 'try again' button a few times?
2008-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	same deal.
2008-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	are the dns servers local or from your isp?
2008-10-22T01:39:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	local.  i've also tried using OpenDNS, to no avail.  for the record, none of the other machines on the network have this issue.
2008-10-22T01:39:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	i have no idea how your network is setup. try using non-local dns servers.
2008-10-22T01:40:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	like openDNS?  already said, makes no difference.
2008-10-22T01:41:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	i'm sure that verizon has their own set of dns servers for its paying customers to use
2008-10-22T01:42:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	while I'm sure they do, the fact that changing the DNS servers to an outside service (without success) indicates to me that the issue lies elsewhere.
2008-10-22T01:43:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	could be a firewall on your end or a faulty ethernet cable
2008-10-22T01:45:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	what happens if you connect the machine directly to the dsl modem?
2008-10-22T01:49:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	the situation is unchanged with the machine connected directly to the router.
2008-10-22T01:50:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	how long as the machine been doing this? just recently or the whole time?
2008-10-22T01:50:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	the machine has been doing this since i distupgraded last night.
2008-10-22T01:51:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	what did you distupgrade from/to?
2008-10-22T01:52:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	then you should inquire in #ubuntu+1, we don't support intrepid here quite as well yet
2008-10-22T01:52:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	the problem is clearly with intrepid, though.
2008-10-22T01:53:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	support for my hardware (forceware integrated ethernet) isn't on the list of (known) issues.  and in any case, a networking problem still ought to be solvable by reasonable methods.
2008-10-22T01:55:00.000Z	Gnea	_mora	i've already explained the support position, and i really don't know much about intrepid right now. just trying to help you get your problem solved. :)
2008-10-22T02:34:00.000Z	_mora	Gnea	 After a lot of swearing/hair-pulling/violence, I determined it's a kernel issue (& is already reported in Launchpad.)  Anyone else asks, the solution is to reboot back into 2.6.24 and then everything's ducky again.  :)
