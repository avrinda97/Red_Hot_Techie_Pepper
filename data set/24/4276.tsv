2007-06-14T15:17:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	I re-installed linux on a dual-boot pc no problem, but I reformatteed the partition first and my other OS was on another physical drive
2007-06-14T15:17:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	well actually I deleted and re-created the partition
2007-06-14T15:18:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	what's the problem
2007-06-14T15:21:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	you could try deleting the partition and then recreating it..
2007-06-14T15:22:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	linux.
2007-06-14T15:22:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	how did you install? manual or ?
2007-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	did you do a manual install or ?
2007-06-14T15:25:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	I did manual..um
2007-06-14T15:27:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	http://www.maximumpc.com/linux?page=0%2C1 (I used the regular live cd but I did the manual instead of guided install as described in this article.. Then I partitioned the unpartitioned space into and ext3 and a swap)

2007-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	Here's mine: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25619/
2007-06-14T15:41:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	your xp partition should be untouched
2007-06-14T15:43:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	honestly nothing should *need* re-installing, but I don't have the knowledge to help you edit the menu.lst file properly
2007-06-14T15:43:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	all my other drives are showing up in ubuntu =/
2007-06-14T15:44:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	are they ntfs?
2007-06-14T15:46:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	hmm
2007-06-14T15:49:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	I'm thinkin
2007-06-14T15:51:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	if you could get into windows somehow
2007-06-14T15:53:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	there shouldn't be, what if the partition manager is right, somehow the partitions were deleted, that'd suck
2007-06-14T15:56:00.000Z	v3n0m`	Ubuntu-Noob	I was going to mentiion the drivers too, u need to get chipset drivers maybe orsomething
