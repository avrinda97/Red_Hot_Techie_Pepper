2005-11-15T10:38:00.000Z	bastardkestrel	Amaranth	 i know, but my question is about ubuntu?
2005-11-15T10:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastardkestrel	Well, not if it worked with GNOME and you're messing with a DE-specific control applet
2005-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	bastardkestrel	Amaranth	im going to avoid the kde wireless packages

2005-11-15T10:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastardkestrel	sometimes, but not a kernel (which is where your drivers are) unless it's to fix a security bug
2005-11-15T10:44:00.000Z	bastardkestrel	Amaranth	the vaio fs660w with nvidia is very toughy, buggy bios
