2011-04-06T00:46:00.000Z	spetrea		does HTTPS use a different key for each request or does the browser generate one once and uses it throughout all of its requests on HTTPS ?
2011-04-06T00:47:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	i doubt it generates a new key for each request
2011-04-06T00:47:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	so would the public key of the browser be a good fingerprint for a machine ?
2011-04-06T00:49:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	dont quote me on that, but yea i belive its asymetric and requires both the public and private (browser) key.
2011-04-06T00:49:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	so i wouldn't think it would be efficient to generate a new key pair for every request
2011-04-06T00:50:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	so then it can be used as a finerprint
2011-04-06T00:51:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	im not sure about that

2011-04-06T00:52:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	yea you see how the data part is totally isolated from the authentication
2011-04-06T00:52:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	unless they change the key i dont think it would change
2011-04-06T00:52:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	but then again over the wire its totally encrypted anyways
2011-04-06T00:53:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	so youd need remote or local access to the machine to get it.
2011-04-06T00:53:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	yeah but can a key be used as a fingerprint, as an identifier for the machine ?
2011-04-06T00:53:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	what do you mean exactly
2011-04-06T00:54:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	like , in that diagram I think the key is the "certificate"
2011-04-06T00:54:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	you got a server using https
2011-04-06T00:54:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	yes it is
2011-04-06T00:54:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	he got many certificates from all the users using that server
2011-04-06T00:54:00.000Z	spetrea	leg3nd	can you make a 1-on-1 relationship between certificates and clients ?
2011-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	spetrea		or wait.. it's per server
2011-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	spetrea		on a server basis
2011-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	spetrea		but it's cool
2011-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	i dont get what your asking sorry, but once the session is stopped the authentication process happens again with a new random key.
2011-04-06T00:56:00.000Z	leg3nd	spetrea	so if your talking about passing a certificate to login no its not possible
