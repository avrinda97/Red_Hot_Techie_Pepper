2010-10-22T21:10:00.000Z	schneider_		guys, whats this ndiswrapper? is it necessary to have this for wifi?
2010-10-22T21:10:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	only if your wireless chipset isn't natively supported
2010-10-22T21:55:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	what wireless chipset do you have?
2010-10-22T21:55:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	i searched in google and i found that it is a sus163u
2010-10-22T21:56:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	is that what shows up in sudo lshw -C network?
2010-10-22T21:56:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	it doesnt show any wifi card
2010-10-22T21:57:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	if lshw doesn't show any wifi card, then ndiswrapper won't fix it.  are you sure?  maybe you should paste the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com
2010-10-22T21:58:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	http://paste.ubuntu.com/518150/
2010-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	and you're sure there is wireless hardware in your system?
2010-10-22T22:01:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	yes, it worked with windows vista before
2010-10-22T22:01:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	paste your lspci output
2010-10-22T22:03:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	here you go http://paste.ubuntu.com/518152/
2010-10-22T22:05:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	i don't see any wireless hardware.  you have wired, but not wireless.  is it a usb wireless device?
2010-10-22T22:05:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	No, it is my system. I have a laptop with integrated wifi
2010-10-22T22:07:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	Is it a serious problem? :o
2010-10-22T22:07:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	if you have integrated wireless, then the device must be this Realtek RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+.  i'm not sure if another module needs to be loaded for it.
2010-10-22T22:08:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	so, what to do now?
2010-10-22T22:08:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	i am researching the RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ to see what i can find out.
2010-10-22T22:10:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	what happens when you type iwconfig from cli?  can you paste that output?
2010-10-22T22:12:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	cli = command line interface or terminal.
2010-10-22T22:12:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	also do sudo lshw -class network and paste that
2010-10-22T22:14:00.000Z	schneider_	seidos	http://paste.ubuntu.com/518165/
2010-10-22T22:17:00.000Z	seidos	schneider_	you'll have to try again.  you didn't type the whole command.  should be "sudo lshw -class network"
