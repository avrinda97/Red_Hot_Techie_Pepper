2010-12-30T10:08:00.000Z	jkoch		does anyone have intel intergrated graphics and have problems watching youtube videos in general and have video lag with any sort of normal process?
2010-12-30T10:09:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	i don't have any problems with that
2010-12-30T10:16:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	strange
2010-12-30T10:09:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	did you have to do anything when you first installed?
2010-12-30T10:09:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	no
2010-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	laptop or desktop?
2010-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	eeepc netbook
2010-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	hmmm, do you think it could be that i have a celeron processor or only 1gb of ram?
2010-12-30T10:10:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	which is a pineview n450 atom
2010-12-30T10:11:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	no
2010-12-30T10:11:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	well if you did have some video lag, what would you try doing to fix it? i tried installing the drivers but they are already installed and i've reinstalled and rebooted 30 times
2010-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	what kind of celeron is that? is it a newer model or very old?
2010-12-30T10:14:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	i'm not sure exactly how old it is, but it's one of those silver and blue dell inspiron 1100's. i just got it for $40 from someone of craigslist. the display was great on xp but i need ubuntu :)
2010-12-30T10:14:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	have you got flash plugin installed?
2010-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	 doesn't it come preinstalled with chrome?
2010-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	if not, then that flash replacement is probably the problem
2010-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	no
2010-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	install flash plugin
2010-12-30T10:15:00.000Z	chris_osx	jkoch	then it should work smoothly
2010-12-30T10:16:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	but either way, even this irc is laggy and opening up a window. its obvious video lag at all times
2010-12-30T10:17:00.000Z	jkoch	chris_osx	yeah :/ my old laptop had no problem with ubuntu
