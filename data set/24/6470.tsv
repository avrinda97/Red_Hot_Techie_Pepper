2006-03-25T13:56:00.000Z	linuxpoet		What do you folks use to view faxes
2006-03-25T13:56:00.000Z	linuxpoet		Oh and Xubuntu rocks!
2006-03-25T13:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	Not sure I've ever done it; what format do they come in as?
2006-03-25T13:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		!tr
2006-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		It was one or the other, and you guessed first :)
2006-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	linuxpoet	tonyyarusso	they come in as a tiff
2006-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	linuxpoet		but they are multipage
2006-03-25T13:59:00.000Z	linuxpoet		In gnome the only one I have found is Ghfaxviewer which works well but is gtk1 so it is ugly
2006-03-25T14:00:00.000Z	linuxpoet		Their is Kfax which works GREAT but I run Xubuntu and don't want to have to install a bunch of KDE cruft
2006-03-25T14:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	Hmm.  I wonder if the pdf viewers would handle that?  Just b/c that's another mulitpage thing.  Heading off for a search...
2006-03-25T14:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	Wait, so you want something that's not QT or GTK?  How're you going to pull that off?
2006-03-25T14:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	Oh, gtk1.  nm.
2006-03-25T14:01:00.000Z	linuxpoet		No... I want to run something that is GTK2
2006-03-25T14:01:00.000Z	linuxpoet		:)
2006-03-25T14:01:00.000Z	linuxpoet		I should check and see if I can get faxes sent as pdf
2006-03-25T14:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	How about efax-gtk?
2006-03-25T14:02:00.000Z	linuxpoet		that is for sending
2006-03-25T14:03:00.000Z	linuxpoet		But I just solved the problem
2006-03-25T14:03:00.000Z	linuxpoet		I can receive them as a pdf :)
2006-03-25T14:03:00.000Z	linuxpoet		So problem is now gone
2006-03-25T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	Says both ways in apt-cache show, but that works too.
2006-03-25T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	"view, print and manage faxes received."
2006-03-25T14:04:00.000Z	linuxpoet		gtk-fax?
2006-03-25T14:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linuxpoet	efax-gtk
