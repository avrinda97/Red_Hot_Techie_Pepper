2005-09-30T14:41:00.000Z	kataklysm		what ever happened to the old Sun Star Office?
2005-09-30T14:42:00.000Z	kataklysm		is staroffice still pretty good?
2005-09-30T14:44:00.000Z	kataklysm		so i guess openoffice is considered staroffices open suite
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	kataklysm		well to write a driver for windows for filesystem compatability you have to have some windows source
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	kataklysm		or be a damn good guesser
2005-09-30T14:47:00.000Z	kataklysm		thats why ext3 for windows is hard to get working....  but there are some 3rd party software to enable it, however i wouldnt recommend it
2005-09-30T14:48:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	i have winXP and Ubuntu, but experiencing problem with GRUB
2005-09-30T14:49:00.000Z	kataklysm	norhted	what kind of problems?
2005-09-30T14:49:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	i installed ubuntu 5 minutes ago;
2005-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	i have a winXP which installed on primary slave drive
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	but when i started, i saw the windows' boot page instead of grup; it has winlilo and winxp options
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	both selection open the windows,
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	i deleted the first one, then, i checked the BIOS,
2005-09-30T14:52:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	i dont know what it is, but it is something that ubuntu added to windwos boot.ini
2005-09-30T14:52:00.000Z	kataklysm	norhted	did you install GRUB to the MBR??
2005-09-30T14:52:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	Yes i did
2005-09-30T14:53:00.000Z	kataklysm	norhted	try to change your boot order in the bios
2005-09-30T14:53:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	yes i did it too, but now GRUB cannot load windowsXP; it says Unknown partition type
2005-09-30T14:54:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	do you think the entry in the windows' boot.ini really required by GRUB
2005-09-30T14:54:00.000Z	kataklysm	norhted	it almost sounds like you installed lilo and grub both
2005-09-30T14:55:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	:( opps, how did i do that :( i just followed the instructions
2005-09-30T14:55:00.000Z	kataklysm	norhted	i really dont have any idea
2005-09-30T14:56:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	:) ok thnx, i will try to add the entry in boot.ini; and if not work, i will reinstall the ubuntu :(
2005-09-30T14:56:00.000Z	norhted	kataklysm	ok i will do that, thnx again
