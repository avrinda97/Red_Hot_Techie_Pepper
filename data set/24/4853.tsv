2009-11-12T04:28:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	that is not the option that effects this!
2009-11-12T04:29:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	it's the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT option which is uncommented correctly
2009-11-12T04:31:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	commented i meant, Line 5 in the pastebin
2010-05-05T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	Not easily.
2010-05-05T12:27:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Hmm, one would have to link /bin et. al. to the "host" system then?
2010-05-05T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	You'd need to use qemu, and it's not trivial (probably not worth it).
2010-05-05T12:31:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Ah, yea probably.
2010-06-03T01:44:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Already used bootinfoscript, and that page is empty...
2010-06-03T01:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	Copy the link, your client is simply parsing it incorrectly
2010-06-03T01:45:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Ahh.. oops
2010-06-03T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	thinkstu: In addition to what is stated in the link I gave you should also run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" and when asked to select install devices make sure that *no* partitions are selected, only whole drives. If you don't do this then grub will be written to the windows bootsector again when there are package upgrades. That command will also ask other questions, just leave them at their defaults (some will be blan
2010-06-03T01:49:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	you got cut off at "(some will be blan"
2010-06-03T01:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	thinkstu: ... (some will be blank, that is normal)
2011-05-02T04:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	See my answer to escott above.
2011-05-02T04:33:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Right, I wasn't sure if that was the case for all versions there.
2011-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	That package seems to be instaled by default on ubuntu, and since plymouth explicitly depends on it, I'd assume it to be tricky to remove it without ripping half of ubuntu with it...
2011-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	OK, I guess I was mistaken then that I had installed it manually.
2011-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	At least, I have it on a virtual machine instance which has nothing to do with nouveau..

2012-03-16T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arand	yarg: Not that there's anything wrong with it, but why install grub's boot sector to the mbr of /dev/sda when /boot/ is on /dev/sdb1?
2012-03-16T02:51:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Since that was the hd that's booting up by default.
2012-03-16T02:56:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	yarg: Does dpkg-reconfigure run an install and update or would that be needed as well?
2012-03-16T03:11:00.000Z	arand	Jordan_U	Ey already posted the one the rescue CD produced: http://paste.ubuntu.com/885594/
