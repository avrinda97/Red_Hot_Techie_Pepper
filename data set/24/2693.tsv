2009-12-12T08:59:00.000Z	blue_		Hello all
2009-12-12T09:00:00.000Z	blue_		Im kind of new to Ubuntu iv used linux for awhile for servers but not as a desktop. Anyways has anyone here compiled GLmartix screen saver from source?
2009-12-12T09:00:00.000Z	blue_		I want to change the color from Green to blue which cant do unless i compile it
2009-12-12T09:01:00.000Z	blue_		Yeah I know how to compile im not that new just cant seem to compile this source
2009-12-12T09:02:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	shall we try together ?
2009-12-12T09:05:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	got a link ?
2009-12-12T09:06:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	Just a regular .configure wont work it comes back with a x11 header error
2009-12-12T09:06:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	I  d/l it, vm will be there in ~5 min, I'll call your nick then
2009-12-12T09:15:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	they have got debs, did you try them ?
2009-12-12T09:15:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	32 or 64 bit ?
2009-12-12T09:16:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	you""could do so, but without nowing that app, config is usually changed after install I 'd guess
2009-12-12T09:17:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	This is the tut I used to get where I am.
2009-12-12T09:17:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	Gues I should have pasted the link http://santhoshtr.livejournal.com/7078.html
2009-12-12T09:20:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	deb is installing
2009-12-12T09:21:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	wants another version of libxml2
2009-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	Yea I was just thinking that Im not even using xscreensaver im using gnome-screensaver i think the only thing i need to know how to compile from source is xscreensaver-gl now that i think about it
2009-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	not sure how to do it iv just been trying to do what was in that tut i sent you
2009-12-12T09:37:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	Will your VM work with OpenGL ect?  If your already on Ubuntu 9.10 then you have the screen saver by default I just want to know how to change it to blue the easier the better maybe you know a different way
2009-12-12T09:39:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	I got D/c if you said anything i missed it.
2009-12-12T10:10:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	source is d/l in vm
2009-12-12T10:10:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	Thought you forgot about me lol
2009-12-12T10:22:00.000Z	DasEi2	blue_	now the libs are too old again, x11-devel pakets needed, I won't follow this up anymore, though I still didn't get what you want to change in the xscreensaver
2009-12-12T10:50:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	To get past the X11 Header/lib error you would run ./configure --x-includes=/usr/include --x-libraries=/usr/lib
2009-12-12T10:51:00.000Z	blue_	DasEi2	What I am trying to do is change the GLMatrix screen saver from Green to blue the color of it if you load the screen saver you should get what I mean but no worries im about to give up on it myself
