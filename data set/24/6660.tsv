2005-09-15T13:25:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	so I don't change the "hoary" to "breezy" ?
2005-09-15T13:25:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	what does that mean?
2005-09-15T13:25:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	it uses a different archive suite to hoary, yes, but it's in the same location and has the same sections.
2005-09-15T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	that's one thing you do
2005-09-15T13:26:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	I did that and it doesn't work
2005-09-15T13:26:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	apt-get says it's not there
2005-09-15T13:27:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	I've deleted the line already
2005-09-15T13:27:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	that's not very useful
2005-09-15T13:28:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	it's better than all the error output I was getting from apt-get
2005-09-15T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	if you want help, change it back and ive us the information I asked for
2005-09-26T12:40:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	best to just ask your real question
2005-09-26T12:41:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	I thought I did
2005-09-26T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	you have no follow up question to that?
2005-09-26T12:41:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	if I had a mouse, I'd paste it again
2005-10-04T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	edit debian/rules
2005-10-04T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	or the makefile
2005-10-04T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	it depends.  what option would you want to change?
2005-10-04T13:38:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	ok
2005-10-04T13:39:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	I'm on a Via C3 processor
2005-10-04T13:39:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	I'd like to change -mmmx and -m3dnow and -march=c3
2005-10-04T13:39:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	does that really help a noticable amount?
2005-10-04T13:39:00.000Z	bob2	Lichte	you'll want to look at pentium-builder, too
2005-10-04T13:40:00.000Z	Lichte	bob2	quite, yes
