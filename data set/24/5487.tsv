2007-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	shinobi2		how can i run java web start from firefox?
2007-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	I don't think you do.  It's a standalone app
2007-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	mozilla can run java web start though... any diff here??
2007-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	web start?
2007-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	yups
2007-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	are you talking about applets maybe?
2007-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	nope, not applets,
2007-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	dunno then.  I know you can run it on its own, though.
2007-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	i write applets and web start apps
2007-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	you know more about it than I do then.  :)
2007-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	is there a special MIME type?
2007-01-14T15:39:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	i was able to config it to run on mozilla. MIME type is JNLP
2007-01-14T15:39:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	Ah.  You should be able to tell FF where to find the java web start program too when you open the proper mime type.
2007-01-14T15:39:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	it should ask you what to do with the file.
2007-01-14T15:40:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	FF=?
2007-01-14T15:41:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	ah... it just worked after what bruening told me what to do
2007-01-14T15:41:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	FireFox.
2007-01-14T15:41:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	guess I missed that.  :/
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	i just installed sun-java5-jdk,  but the java command still shows gcc's java compiler, need to reboot?
2007-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	may have to do more configging but you'll definitely need to re-source /etc/profile
2007-01-14T15:49:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	ah, there it is.  The extra config: "sudo update-alternatives --config java"
2007-01-14T15:50:00.000Z	Solarion	shinobi2	after you set up java, you'll need to run ". /etc/profile" (I think in each window, although it might be unnecessary in newly-opened windows) until you log in again.
2007-01-14T15:51:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	ok thanks,
2007-01-14T15:57:00.000Z	shinobi2	Solarion	hey i did not have to run the /etc/profile , it just works after update-alternative, THANKS
