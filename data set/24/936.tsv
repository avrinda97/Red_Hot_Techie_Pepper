2012-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	g0rby		Good morning,  could some one help me unbrick my system? :)
2012-05-04T10:58:00.000Z	g0rby		 I was 1/2 way through a 12.04 upgrade from 11.04 It had got to the part where things were asking to be configured in a terminal and my power went down. Now when i reboot I get the error mountall: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /lib/libply.so.2) General error mounting filesystems. A maintainance shell will now be started
2012-05-04T10:59:00.000Z	alankila	g0rby	the command dpkg --configure -a is what you need
2012-05-04T10:59:00.000Z	alankila		let's hope you can get that to execute
2012-05-04T10:59:00.000Z	g0rby		cool, but i ifconfig lists nothing
2012-05-04T10:59:00.000Z	g0rby		even though i have cable connection
2012-05-04T11:00:00.000Z	alankila		forget about that, your first priority is to finish the upgrade
2012-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	g0rby	alankila	thx for help, when i run that it winges about read only file system
2012-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	alankila	g0rby	okay, mount / -o remount,rw then
2012-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	g0rby		should i reboot to recovery mode then try it?
2012-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	alankila		might also have to fsck it
2012-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	g0rby	alankila	it runs now but then dies "errors were encountered processing:" (lots of packages)
2012-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	g0rby		some pretty important ones
2012-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	g0rby		like module-init-tools
2012-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	alankila	g0rby	okay, try to run it a few times, if it makes no progress, try apt-get -f install
2012-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	g0rby		I see the package "mountall" which is present in the error message at boot, mabe try something with that?
2012-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	alankila		the downside is that it might want something from network though, but the key here is to, one way or other, identify the problematic bits and force the upgrade to finish
2012-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	alankila		the downloaded archives are at /var/cache/apt/archives, so you can also try dpkg -i them directly
2012-05-04T11:07:00.000Z	g0rby	alankila	cool, think we are getting there with apt-get install -f lots of shizz happening
2012-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	alankila	g0rby	yes... alternate between these commands, then do apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade
2012-05-04T11:08:00.000Z	alankila		with luck you will reach the finishing line of complete upgrade and after sync + reboot things should be good again
2012-05-04T11:10:00.000Z	alankila		need to be going now.
2012-05-04T11:12:00.000Z	g0rby	alankila	apt-get dist-upgrade is doing loads of stuff, but apt-get-upgrade wanted to get stuff from the net
2012-05-04T11:13:00.000Z	g0rby	alankila	 but ive seen it go through the problematic packages, think its going to be ok after this :)
