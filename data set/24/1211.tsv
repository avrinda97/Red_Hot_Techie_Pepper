2010-05-23T22:57:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, so install linux to that drive. The read/write stuff in linux for ntfs have been fine for me. Backups of really important data might be an idea. But I'd recommend that anyway :D
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, I don;t actually know, sorry. I use EXT4, but I have no more than 640 GB of data, most of which is on ntfs anyway
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		<Guest33152>, google?
2010-05-23T22:58:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, No problem
2010-05-23T22:59:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		peitr, A quick google should get you some stuff on various linux filesystems btw
2010-05-23T22:59:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		:D
2010-05-23T23:01:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		I can;t remember the bit depth, Black_Phantom.
2010-05-23T23:01:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Sorry
2010-05-23T23:02:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak		Does anyone know how to improve the battery life of my laptop when it runs ubuntu?
2010-05-23T23:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	depending on your cpu, the 'cpufrequtils' package might be of help
2010-05-23T23:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	to see the status of services as mentioned by rhonny, i think you can use the 'chkconfig' command. i haven't used it much... but check out --> chkconfig -A
2010-05-23T23:06:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	onetinsoldier	that packes comes up as "untrusted"
2010-05-23T23:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	hmm? what does? chkconfig -A ?
2010-05-23T23:07:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	onetinsoldier	IT;s not currently installed on my system, when I use aptitude to try and install it it warns me that it's an untrusted package
2010-05-23T23:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	the cpufrequtils package? interesting
2010-05-23T23:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	don't know why it would say that
2010-05-23T23:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	or chkconfig.. don't know why it would either
2010-05-23T23:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	you have any ppa's added?
2010-05-23T23:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	do you have any ppa's added or have you added anything to your software sources allowing you to get packages other than stock lucid packages?
2010-05-23T23:11:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	onetinsoldier	yeah
2010-05-23T23:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	ok, that's why then ;-)
2010-05-23T23:11:00.000Z	TheGrammarFreak	onetinsoldier	I am win! Lol.
2010-05-23T23:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	TheGrammarFreak	lol :)
