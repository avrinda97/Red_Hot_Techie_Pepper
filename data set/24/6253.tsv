2006-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	youre missing install or remove
2006-01-02T07:11:00.000Z	EddieDaMan	Sepheebear	do you know how to play win32 files on ubuntu?
2006-01-02T07:11:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	sorry i dont do windows
2006-01-02T07:13:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	but yeah win32codecs is great for opening .wmv .asf .wma files
2006-01-02T07:15:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	win32codecs package isnt in any official Ubuntu repositories
2006-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	i didnt even know xine *could* stream video
2006-01-02T08:21:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	yeah it's in universe
2006-01-02T08:29:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	totem is an evil little mozilla plugin isnt it? i never was able to stop it, i just installed mozilla-mplayer and that took precedence over the totem stuff
2006-01-02T08:30:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	dirty little plugin
2006-01-02T08:32:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	you can probably just move the plugin out of /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/
2006-01-02T08:47:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	yeah there is a new totem package in breezy-backports that has the totem-mozilla-plugin removed as a separate package
2006-01-02T08:58:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	 enable the multiverse repository and sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
2006-01-02T09:00:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	if youre on breezy, enable the breezy-backports repository and install the latest available totem
2006-01-02T09:05:00.000Z	Sepheebear	EddieDaMan	sure you can enable breezy-backports
