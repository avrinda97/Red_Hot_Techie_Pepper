2009-12-11T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 theres hundereds of conky scripts/examples at the conky home page you can use/alter as you want.  Or try gkrellm (i think i spelt that riught)
2009-12-11T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 ask and see. :)  if nothing else i can point ya to the faq hat has the answer.

2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 the conky command can generate a 'default' config, or the conky homapage has them you can download.
2009-12-11T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 or checkthe contents of the conky packatge to see what it installed where..
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	therekku	Dr_Willis_	When i type Conky in terminal, i only get "Bus Error"
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 or use 'locate conky' to see what it insalled where also
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 you dont see conky on the desktop?
2009-12-11T22:35:00.000Z	therekku	Dr_Willis_	No i do not see it.

2009-12-11T22:38:00.000Z	therekku	Dr_Willis_	What do u think i should do :-/?, i've been trying all day long to search inet for this, with nothing, Things that are going wrong: The Conky file isnt there -> and Conky in terminal gives me bus error.
2009-12-11T22:38:00.000Z	therekku	Dr_Willis_	Should i write that in terminal yes?
2009-12-11T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 make a config and tweak it.. or try some simple example configs. No idwa what the buss error is about
2009-12-11T22:39:00.000Z	therekku	Dr_Willis_	When i type that in Terminal, i only get "bus Error" back
2009-12-11T22:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	therekku	 no idea on that then. You got some deeper issues going on. did itmake the file at all?
