2007-11-02T16:31:00.000Z	lkthomas		guys, anyone using 64bit system with 4G of ram ?
2007-11-02T16:31:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	Yes, why do you ask?
2007-11-02T16:31:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	the speed of installation are way too slow
2007-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	Which CPU/chipset?
2007-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	response speed are so slow as well
2007-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	core2quad, 4G RAM, intel board
2007-11-02T16:32:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	would help if you had a proper 64-bit CPU.  On the core and core2's I found the 32-bit version was a lot faster.
2007-11-02T16:33:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	well, I want to know why am I getting slow response speed
2007-11-02T16:33:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	From Intel, only the Xeon seems to have even a halfway decent 64-bit mode.
2007-11-02T16:33:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	Because your CPU doesn't handle 64-bits properly
2007-11-02T16:33:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	for 32bit version, I can't map all 4G RAM even PAE mode is on
2007-11-02T16:33:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	So it has to do twice the work to get the same job done.
2007-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	 try with the 32-bit version, you'll see a dramatic speed difference
2007-11-02T16:35:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	I don't need to try, I am switching from 32bit to 64bit, you don't get the point
2007-11-02T16:36:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	the point is 4GB RAM can't allocate on 32bit version
2007-11-02T16:38:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	I have 4GB on my old 32-bit system.  Depends on your northbridge
2007-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	did you use 64G PAE support ?
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	 IIRC yes.  I gave up on the Core series awhile back tho for bad performance
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	I think it is a bug
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	after enabled 64G PAE, my system can't boot up
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	oh fun.
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	Downix	lkthomas	The whole core series is a bug
2007-11-02T16:58:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	it said no buffer space
2007-11-02T17:00:00.000Z	lkthomas	Downix	does ubuntu got PAE pre-compiled kernel ?
