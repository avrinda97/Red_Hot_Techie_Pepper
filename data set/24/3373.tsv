2008-03-30T14:06:00.000Z	itai-michaelson		can anyone (not living in China) confirm that the lxde repo is up? can you open "http://people.linux.org.tw/~pcman/ubuntu%20./ " in your browser?
2008-03-30T14:06:00.000Z	itai-michaelson		i get a 404 error
2008-03-30T14:08:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	works over here (Beijing)
2008-03-30T14:09:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	really? i thought it is blocked because its in taiwan. maybe my iSP blocks it...
2008-03-30T14:09:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	I can never figure out how they figure out what gets blocked
2008-03-30T14:10:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	neither do i , i know some stuff is blocked at the ISP level...
2008-03-30T14:11:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	but its strange that I get a 404 error ,usually when its blocked i get a server not found...
2008-03-30T14:12:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	that url you gave me was funny, I chopped some stuff off then end though: try this http://people.linux.org.tw/~pcman/ubuntu/
2008-03-30T14:14:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	i see , without the end bits i can open it here as well.
2008-03-30T14:14:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	yep, usually if you get the 404 you're doing good -- timing out is bad =P
2008-03-30T14:15:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	however is this post:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=738958 the repo link is with the end bit but apt-get gives me a 404. i will try to chop the end in my sources.list and see
2008-03-30T14:17:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	ah, that's because apt needs the end bits, but when using a browser, you have to chop off the " ./" at the end
2008-03-30T14:18:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	i just learned that....but i still get a 404 with apt. strange
2008-03-30T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	that is strange
2008-03-30T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	let me give it a try and see what I get
2008-03-30T14:19:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	thanks
2008-03-30T14:19:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	i was apt-getting lxde
2008-03-30T14:20:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	I'm having no problems with it
2008-03-30T14:21:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	if you want to put your /etc/apt/sources.list file on the pastebin I'll take a look at it
2008-03-30T14:21:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	thanks - i will try to apt-get update again and see if that helps
2008-03-30T14:23:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	it works now , after apt-get update ....is that strange or what....
2008-03-30T14:23:00.000Z	compwiz18	itai-michaelson	good :)
2008-03-30T14:24:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	compwiz18	thanks for your help anyway....
