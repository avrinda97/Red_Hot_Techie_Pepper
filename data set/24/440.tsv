2011-08-31T23:24:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	but ubuntu being on that win7 partition would mean killing ubuntu, no
2011-08-31T23:25:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	so you don't have ubuntu on its own partition?
2011-08-31T23:28:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	hmm, maybe i do... its on sda, /host is on sdb ... sorry im not too familiar wtih this stuff. sda has 1 2 and 3 ... but im honestly confused at what im seeing vs df -h
2011-08-31T23:29:00.000Z	agentile		what is /dev/loop0 referring to in regard to the partitions i have
2011-08-31T23:30:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	do you have win7 mounted under ubuntu? df should tell you
2011-08-31T23:31:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	loop0 means you are probably mounting a virtual hard disk stored on the win7 partition
2011-08-31T23:32:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	when you start ubuntu, do you have to start win7 first?

2011-08-31T23:32:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	 no
2011-08-31T23:32:00.000Z	agentile		i have the option from the boot menu
2011-08-31T23:32:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	yes that sounds right
2011-08-31T23:33:00.000Z	agentile		is there a way for me to free up space on that virtual hd on the win7 partition
2011-08-31T23:33:00.000Z	agentile		via gparted or otherwise
2011-08-31T23:34:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	pastebin the output of: mount
2011-08-31T23:35:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	http://privatepaste.com/1db536f00b
2011-08-31T23:38:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	if you look in /host does that contain the win7 files?
2011-08-31T23:39:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	correct.
2011-08-31T23:40:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	well /host has 192G free if that is enough you can use it, most convenient way would be to simlink it into the / filesystem
2011-08-31T23:42:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	sounds like a plan, so i just need to symlink /host to / ?
2011-08-31T23:43:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	no symlink /host to /somewhere, if you want it in your home dir it would be /home/username/somename
2011-08-31T23:44:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	and the ubuntu will magically incorporate in that free space eh
2011-08-31T23:45:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	exactly, there is another option which is to change the mount point /host to /somewhere-else which you can do in /etc/fstab but you really need to get that right
2011-08-31T23:46:00.000Z	agentile	keithb	alright, thanks for your help
2011-08-31T23:46:00.000Z	keithb	agentile	np
