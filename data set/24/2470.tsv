2009-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	that's a file that will help you
2009-01-03T12:26:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	um...it's a file
2009-01-03T12:27:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	permission denied for what?
2009-01-03T12:27:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	permission denied
2009-01-03T12:27:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	=\. i meant what did you do? how did you access it?
2009-01-03T12:32:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	so you needed sudo to read the X log? that's strange
2009-01-03T12:32:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	ls -l /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-01-03T12:34:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	ctrl+x
2009-01-03T12:41:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	got    -rw-r--r-- 1 root 13140 2009-01-02 19:31 /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-01-03T12:41:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	um...
2009-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	this means that you should not have gotten permission denied and something is screwy with your UIDs
2009-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	do you have another install of linux or something?
2009-01-03T12:42:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	no
2009-01-03T12:43:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	I just yesterday installed Ubuntu
2009-01-03T12:43:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	output of "id"?
2009-01-03T12:48:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	uid=1000(gasto) gid=1000(gasto) groups=4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),123(admin),124(sambashare),1000(gasto)
2009-01-03T12:49:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	then it's kind of strange that Xorg.0.log has GID 13140...
2009-01-03T12:50:00.000Z	gasto	raylu	what do you suggest? Is there anything to reset the Xorg?
2009-01-03T12:52:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	oh, i just read some scrollback. i'd echo the previous suggestion and install the nvidia driver with the restricted drivers manager or the package manager
2009-01-03T12:55:00.000Z	raylu	gasto	aptitude install nvidia-glx
