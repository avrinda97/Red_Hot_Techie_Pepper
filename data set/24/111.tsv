2012-07-04T07:55:00.000Z	KingBlooy		I'm having some trouble with displaying fonts, they all appear as boxes. Can anyone help me out?
2012-07-04T07:56:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	 Hmm, it would seem your locals are set wrong. What language are you using? Where do you live? (US? Canada? (keep it vauge))
2012-07-04T07:57:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	What fonts are giving you trouble? Did you modify any files under /etc?
2012-07-04T07:59:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	How did you change it?
2012-07-04T08:01:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Never mind, I don't think that's a relevant file. I honestly don't know what it does Aha!
2012-07-04T08:02:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Can you put the output of the command "locale" on pastebin and sending me a link to it?
2012-07-04T08:04:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Open terminal, and type "locale" , hit enter. Go to http://www.pastebin.com and paste the output in the box, send me the link in the address bar.
2012-07-04T08:04:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Hit submit and send me the link* aha

2012-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Okay... your locales are fine. That means its the fonts.
2012-07-04T08:14:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	What fonts specifically are giving you problems? and where, in the terminal, on a tty, or in the desktop itself
2012-07-04T08:19:00.000Z	KingBlooy	NictraSavios	Every program I open up seems to show these boxes as the font, but File Browser seems fine.
2012-07-04T08:20:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Did you change any fonts or anything like that?
2012-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	KingBlooy	NictraSavios	the box fonts started appear after I tried installing GTK+ and necessary packages via Terminal.
2012-07-04T08:24:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	I know, I'm making a command for you to try aha
2012-07-04T08:26:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Run this:  sudo apt-get install --reinstall --only-upgrade ttf*
2012-07-04T08:26:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Run this:  sudo apt-get install --reinstall --only-upgrade ttf-*
2012-07-04T08:29:00.000Z	KingBlooy	NictraSavios	I received the following error after inputting your command: "E: Sense only is not understood, try true or false."
2012-07-04T08:30:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	^.- Are you sure you put it exactly "sudo apt-get install --reinstall --upgrade-only ttf*"
2012-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	^.- Are you sure you put it exactly "sudo apt-get install --reinstall --only-upgrade ttf*" <  sorry aha. Switched it a bit. This ones correct
2012-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	KingBlooy	NictraSavios	I copied and pasted it into Terminal.
2012-07-04T08:32:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Try what I just typed once more, without quotes ""sudo apt-get install --reinstall --only-upgrade ttf*"
2012-07-04T08:33:00.000Z	KingBlooy	NictraSavios	Still having the same problem
2012-07-04T08:36:00.000Z	NictraSavios	KingBlooy	Damn... I really dont know.
