2008-03-18T22:38:00.000Z	steverap		ok, relative newbie here with partial success
2008-03-18T22:38:00.000Z	steverap		if someone can help me start wireless networking I'd be grateful
2008-03-18T22:38:00.000Z	steverap		I have made it halfway
2008-03-18T22:39:00.000Z	steverap		I've determined the model number and chipset of my wireless card, and that the driver is probably included in Gutsy
2008-03-18T22:39:00.000Z	steverap		and I'm running iwconfig but without success
2008-03-18T22:40:00.000Z	steverap		some wireless networking questions anyone?
2008-03-18T22:40:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	steverap	try manually configuring your network
2008-03-18T22:41:00.000Z	steverap	KRaZy_WaKa	I'm working on that .. I don'lt know the command names for it except iwconfig
2008-03-18T22:41:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		thats what i had to do originally to get mine to work
2008-03-18T22:41:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa		double-click the network icon at top right
2008-03-18T22:42:00.000Z	steverap	KRaZy_WaKa	that's a very good start, thanks
2008-03-18T22:43:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	steverap	my bad single click the icon then click the manual config option
2008-03-18T22:43:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	steverap	not a problem i just switched from winXP to ubuntu Gutsy myself lol
2008-03-18T22:43:00.000Z	steverap	KRaZy_WaKa	now i'm being asked for the password for default keyring to unlock.  no clue.
2008-03-18T22:45:00.000Z	KRaZy_WaKa	steverap	yeah what nick said lol  should be your user password
2008-03-18T22:45:00.000Z	steverap	KRaZy_WaKa	and nickrud -- I think that did it!
