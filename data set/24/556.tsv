2011-06-09T03:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	you leaving or do you have a moment to try some things?
2011-06-09T03:15:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	I have time, but I'm currently running off a livecd which has working internet, so it'd be hard to debug
2011-06-09T03:15:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	but if you've any suggestions, I'm all ears
2011-06-09T03:16:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	So it works in the liveCD but when you install it compltely it crashes?
2011-06-09T03:16:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	the 10.04 livecd works, but later versions can only view networks, but can never connect
2011-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	you checked to see if there's a driver conflict going on?
2011-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	10.10 works after installing 10.04 and upgrading, but the livecd doesn't
2011-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	kind of, but the driver works
2011-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	The later versions might be activating extra drivers that conflict.
2011-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	any tips on how to spot conflicts?
2011-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	sudo lshw -C network in the livecd and look at the configuration: line for the wireless card's entry. note what driver= says
2011-06-09T03:24:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	the driver is iwlagn
2011-06-09T03:26:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	is your network a wireless-N only?
2011-06-09T03:27:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	I don't think so, I think it's just G
2011-06-09T03:28:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	ok.
2011-06-09T03:28:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	here's the dmesg for wlan0 and iwlagn, I'd forgotten I saved it http://pastebin.com/f5pU6SuG
2011-06-09T03:36:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	Reason 16 is "Group Key Handshake failed/timed out"
2011-06-09T03:39:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	paste the results of modinfo iwlagn please
2011-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	this is it for the livecd http://pastebin.com/Fbc3syHa
2011-06-09T03:47:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	I'm at a loss, sorry. Either it's a driver conflict or they changed something after 10.04
2011-06-09T03:49:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	thanks for the help, I'm going to compare the output of modinfo iwlagn and see if I can narrow it down
2011-06-09T03:49:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	The big thing is to run sudo lshw -C network and look for more than one driver=blah on the configuration: line
2011-06-09T03:50:00.000Z	res22_	rationalOgre	thanks
2011-06-09T03:50:00.000Z	rationalOgre	res22_	If you have something liek driver=blah,bleh then blacklist one and reboot, if that doesn't work, swap and reboot.
