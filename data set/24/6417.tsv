2005-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	soundray		There are four different network environments where I use my laptop. What's the best way to autodetect and autoconfigure the settings according to the environment?
2005-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	install networkmanager
2005-12-20T08:50:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	are all four environments wireless?
2005-12-20T08:51:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	ok. so why do you need different setup for the three cabled locations?
2005-12-20T08:51:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	plug in, get dhcp-lease, start working.
2005-12-20T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	one is static IP (work), one DHCP (home) and one is no-net (on the train).
2005-12-20T08:52:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	the fourth is wireless DHCP.
2005-12-20T08:53:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	take a look at network manager (sudo apt-cache show network-manager). If that's the same as NetworkManager in Fedora, it's just what you're looking for I think
2005-12-20T08:54:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	it's in Universe, btw
2005-12-20T08:54:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	thanks, I just installed it.
2005-12-20T08:55:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	the network setup tool in breezy actually has "locations" functionality, but I have no idea how to set it up
2005-12-20T08:57:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	I've tried locations, it never seems to do what I expect. Also, it's not automatic.
2005-12-20T08:58:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	automatic is difficult to do, I think. Unless you can do something you can configure with grub. But then you'd have to boot every time you change locations
2005-12-20T09:01:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	but why is the train no-net? ;) I am online 3 hours on the train every day
2005-12-20T09:01:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	whenever I boot in a new location, I have trouble with gnome-session. So I login on a text console, run a script to exchange /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf... annoying.
2005-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	on-train-line?
2005-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	enter your hostname as an alias to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts
2005-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	then your hostname is always resolvable
2005-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	I just assumed that it was...
2005-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	and gnome-session will not have problems. I alternate between work (cabled), train (gprs/edge) and home (wlan) without any trouble with gnome-session
2005-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	how do you connect to GPRS, via a phone or PCMCIA card?
2005-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	phone. bluetooth. So I just keep my phone in my pocket and dial.
2005-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	Raskall-mob	soundray	use the gnome-ppp for dialing.
2005-12-20T09:07:00.000Z	soundray	Raskall-mob	back in a few minutes...
