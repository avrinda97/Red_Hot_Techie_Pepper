2012-06-25T18:44:00.000Z	zorael		Is there a bootloader that does OS probing at every boot? GRUB probes and saves all found OSs upon calling update-grub (writes into /boot/grub/grub.cfg), so if I install onto an usb drive and boot it from another computer, device nodes will be different and boot will fail :V
2012-06-25T18:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	I guess to boot the usb from another system you would just have to be sure that the bios boot sequence was to boot usb first
2012-06-25T18:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	I guess the device nodes you must mean like /dev/sdXX?   that should be handled by UUID
2012-06-25T18:48:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	Certainly, but surely bioses don't reorder the booted drive to /dev/sda?
2012-06-25T18:48:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	Yes, except for set root='(hd0,1)'
2012-06-25T18:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	you must boot from old grub not grub2?
2012-06-25T18:48:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	Not at all, I'm free to try whatever
2012-06-25T18:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	in grub to root can be set to a UUID
2012-06-25T18:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	or I should say in grub2 it can be
2012-06-25T18:49:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	So the set root line and the search line replace eachother? Sec, pastebinning
2012-06-25T18:50:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	http://pastie.org/4148721 -- ignore boot parameters
2012-06-25T18:51:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	Does the search function override set root? If so, it will probably do fine
2012-06-25T18:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	as seen here db601797-752f-446f-b7f8-0480ed0d7413  must be the UUID
2012-06-25T18:52:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	Yes, I'm concerned about (hd0,1)
2012-06-25T18:52:00.000Z	zorael		makes sense if it's overridden
2012-06-25T18:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	I'm not sure maybe it looks there first and if fails to find it then it searches
2012-06-25T18:54:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	All right, so let's say GRUB2 can boot the usb drive by UUID regardless of standard device node. It's still not possible to have it probe and list other installed operating systems, right? Such as if the boot flag for the Windows partition has been removed
2012-06-25T18:54:00.000Z	zorael		(obviously I could boot into a full linux environment and fix that, but still)
2012-06-25T18:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	no it will only boot what was known when the usb was booted as root and update-grub run
2012-06-25T18:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	unless they happen to be the same on this other system but not lickly
2012-06-25T18:57:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	right. Know of any alternative boot loaders with this functionality, by any chance?
2012-06-25T18:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	maybe plop
2012-06-25T18:59:00.000Z	zorael	sacarlson	That one looks promising, I'll google around. Many thanks
2012-06-25T19:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	zorael	good luck
