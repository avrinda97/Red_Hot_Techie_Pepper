2005-09-18T05:02:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List#I take a look at 2200BG
2005-09-18T05:04:00.000Z	Rebel__	robotgeek	I thought that ndiswrapper wasn't necessary with Ubuntu ?
2005-09-18T05:05:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	yours is a different version, isn't it?
2005-09-18T05:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	try lsmod | grep ipw
2005-09-18T05:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	wireless cards act crazy sometimes
2005-09-18T05:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	it seems that the modules are loaded
2005-09-18T05:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	okay, so all u are not able to do is go online?
2005-09-18T05:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	can u do a ping and do a 'dmesg', just check if u get packet reject or something similiar?
2005-09-18T05:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	so u even acquire an ip address via dhcp?
2005-09-18T05:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	no problems with the driver if u are able to acquire an ip address though dhcp, afaik
2005-09-18T05:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	what happened?
2005-09-18T05:16:00.000Z	robotgeek	Rebel__	not good, try using the ndiswrapper driver and see if that works
