2007-07-26T05:12:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	You may want to upgrade to SATA motherboard.
2007-07-26T05:13:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	these are a few of my spares.  My main board with the SATA I have for my Windows and Photoshop CS2.

2007-07-26T05:14:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	I'm not surprised.  I'm a big fan of Seagate drives.
2007-07-26T05:14:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	They do make reliable drives with 5 yr warrenties. And own Maxtor now
2007-07-26T05:15:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	I know.  I own a bit over a TB of Seagate :p
2007-07-26T05:16:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	the machines I've loaded so far are just extra's that have been sitting around gathering dust.
2007-07-26T05:16:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	I have 80gb hdd but I havent got a chance to use it. It's SATA and I can use IDE on this system. System build in progress
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	my main system boots to a 80gb SATA, with a 200GB and a 320GB SATA data drive.
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	You sure you got enough space? {-P
2007-07-26T05:18:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	A Canon 20D in raw mode keeps trying to prove me wrong.
2007-07-26T05:19:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	Convert them to better format and back up to DVD
2007-07-26T05:19:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	yup, that's part of my workflow now :p
2007-07-26T05:20:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	In meantime, get two 500gb drives
2007-07-26T05:20:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	and dump 80gb for $30-$40 on ebay
2007-07-26T05:20:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	I was actually looking at those the other day.
2007-07-26T05:21:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	might get lucky at costco.
2007-07-26T05:22:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	Costco here doesn't have as many good options.  I'm a newegg.com fan.
2007-07-26T05:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	costco.com is just as good.
2007-07-26T05:23:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	except when you live in Hawaii :-(
2007-07-26T05:26:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	can you use PM?
2007-07-26T05:27:00.000Z	Kawika	kahrytan	I replied on the PM, did you get it?
2007-07-26T05:28:00.000Z	kahrytan	Kawika	No. goto #Kawika  maybe?
