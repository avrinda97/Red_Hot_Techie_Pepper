2007-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	swami	ronzo	this is what i did
2007-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	swami	ronzo	sudo apt-get install beryl beryl-plugins beryl-plugins-unsupported emerald
2007-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	ronzo	swami	that should do it for you. =)
2007-06-25T11:48:00.000Z	ronzo	swami	if you open synaptic, it makes install beryl much easier. =)
2007-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	swami	ronzo	now am tired, lemme go take a shower :D rest of the messing with settings after that :D
