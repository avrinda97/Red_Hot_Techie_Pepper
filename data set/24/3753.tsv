2007-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	what are you looking for exactly?
2007-10-21T05:34:00.000Z	Sergo	ZionPsyfer	an alternative to windows...
2007-10-21T05:35:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	more specifically.   What about Ubuntu or Redhat or SuSE are you not satisfied with?
2007-10-21T05:35:00.000Z	Sergo		anyone have installed the gutsy ubuntu from alternate, how much time the installation process take?
2007-10-21T05:39:00.000Z	Sergo	ZionPsyfer	with ubuntu i am satisf., but don't know why the installation process take so much time
2007-10-21T05:39:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	how long did it take?
2007-10-21T05:39:00.000Z	Sergo		zionPsyfer: i watched the T.V. 1 hour and the installation procces wasn't finished yet
2007-10-21T05:39:00.000Z	Sergo		waited again some time and then interupted the installation..
2007-10-21T05:40:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	That's not horrible.  A vista install at work took around 90 minutes.  It definitely depends on your hardware and how many packages you install.
2007-10-21T05:41:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	No half hour install, which is nice.  But an hour isn't too too bad.  Have you tested the media as well?  cdrom might be having trouble as well.
2007-10-21T05:43:00.000Z	Sergo	ZionPsyfer	don't know.. the ubuntu 7.04 has been installed more quiqly..
2007-10-21T05:45:00.000Z	Sergo	ZionPsyfer	for example , i think, what the installation process must be more regid..
2007-10-21T05:46:00.000Z	Sergo	ZionPsyfer	for example, if there is a small scrath on Cd, the installation can fail with red screen:) .. with windows xp, there can be a 1000 of scratch, but no problem with installing
2007-10-21T05:46:00.000Z	Sergo		and installation doesn't freeze
2007-10-21T05:47:00.000Z	ZionPsyfer	Sergo	see my experience is the opposite.  My XP cd is scratched and I have to use a specific cdrom drive to install it.  My dapper cd is more forgiving and is scratched worse.
