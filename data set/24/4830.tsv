2007-04-21T13:22:00.000Z	jasin		I get an error at startup.
2007-04-21T13:23:00.000Z	jasin		wpa2 is supported?
2007-04-21T13:23:00.000Z	evil	jasin	yes
2007-04-21T13:23:00.000Z	evil	jasin	but is a mess if you also need to set a static IP
2007-04-21T13:24:00.000Z	jasin	evil	I would nver use a static ip over wireless
2007-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	jasin		no encryption is secure, wep, wpa, wpa2 have all been cracked.
2007-04-21T13:25:00.000Z	evil	jasin	how would you use it?
2007-04-21T13:26:00.000Z	jasin	evil	it was setup by default on my system all I had to do is enter the keyring pass.
2007-04-21T13:26:00.000Z	jasin	evil	i didn't do anything the ubuntu install did it all for me.
2007-04-21T13:27:00.000Z	evil	jasin	ok, but i decided to turn off DHCP on router and use WPA2
2007-04-21T13:28:00.000Z	jasin	evil	you don't need to turn off dhcp to use wpa2, at least not protocol wise.
2007-04-21T13:29:00.000Z	evil	jasin	i don't do it because of WPA, i don't use dhcp only to be a little further safe, even if is almost unuseful

2007-04-21T13:30:00.000Z	jasin	evil	 turning off dhcp makes you less secure not more secure
2007-04-21T13:31:00.000Z	evil	jasin	ok,tell me why plz,i am not so expert
2007-04-21T13:31:00.000Z	jasin	evil	static ip address are more easy to dos
2007-04-21T13:31:00.000Z	evil	jasin	right :) (anyway i use to map ports on router)
2007-04-21T13:33:00.000Z	jasin	evil	so? you still have ports open every system does and clossing ports off does not secure it just tells someone which ports are still open.

2007-04-21T13:33:00.000Z	evil	jasin	could we go in pvt?
2007-04-21T13:33:00.000Z	jasin		opaul, I was addressing his question, so if its offtopic then take that up with him not me.
2007-04-21T13:33:00.000Z	jasin	evil	no
2007-04-21T13:34:00.000Z	jasin		I prefer to talk here.
2007-04-21T13:35:00.000Z	evil	jasin	as you wish,is a bit confusing.anyway mapping ports to an ip on router, you allow only some traffic, is not totally unuseful
