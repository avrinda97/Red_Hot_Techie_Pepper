2008-05-25T03:23:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	Wait, You say you can successfully boot by choosing the 30 from the BIOS to boot from?
2008-05-25T03:16:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	How does it stop working?
2008-05-25T03:20:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	is it broken currently?
2008-05-25T03:21:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	Yes I am running windows at the moment the only thing that will boot and I can only load it by booting off the 30 ide (slave drive) and selecting it from there
2008-05-25T03:22:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	If its broken currently, boot into Ubuntu (since we'll need to reead the files there) and we'll take a look
2008-05-25T03:24:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	yes, but only to windows, selecting ubuntu displays an error
2008-05-25T03:24:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	Alright, and when you boot off your 320, what do you get?
2008-05-25T03:26:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	" loading grub 1.5, loading. " computer freezes must hit reset button
2008-05-25T03:30:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	Alright, so looks like your MBR on your 320 (I'm assuming that's your primary boot device?) has the wrong partition for /boot, or at least, it appears to.  But we can fix the Ubuntu one too.  You could always just boot to the second IDE by default
2008-05-25T03:33:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	primary boot device is my 160 ide maxter windows xp, 30 ide is my secondary linux drive and the 320 sata is just a data partition
2008-05-25T03:33:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	Sorry, I think I had crossed the 160 and the 320.  If you boot to the 160, you get the grub 15 error?  Either way, booting to the 30 works, so we'll go with that for a while.
2008-05-25T03:34:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	should I boot off the live cd and reinstall grub http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 the stuff above the red section works for me
2008-05-25T03:36:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	We don't need you to reinstall GRUB just yet, since we can get to the grub menu from the 30.  But yes, to get it to GRUB from the 160, you'll need to reinstall GRUB on the primary's MBR.  We just need to edit the grub menu to get Ubuntu to boot.  Which... well, would be easier if we were in Ubuntu.  But we should be ok.  Go to the GRUB menu, and highlight one of the ubuntu lines, and hit 'e', we'll need to know the root line (something lik
2008-05-25T03:41:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	alright, do you want the boot line off the 30 or my 160, both load grub tho only my 30 can get into windows
2008-05-25T03:42:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	er... both load grub?  Do you have more than one Linux install on this computer?
2008-05-25T03:43:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	If they both load GRUB, does the menu you get with each look the same?
2008-05-25T03:45:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	yes the menu looks the same. winxp on my 160, and hardy 8.04 on my 30 it's just that i've tried installing grub to different drives. The 320 last time grub was working was the only drive i could load ubuntu off. thing is I used to use 7.10 and had none of these problems
2008-05-25T03:48:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	the reinstalling that you're doing is only reinstalling the bootloader portion (stage1), which sits on the MBR (yes, we're getting a little technical here), the stuff on the MBR boots GRUB which sits in your /boot partition (which, if you only have one partition for linux, is inside your / partition).  So, all three of these drives all (should) be trying to boot to the same /boot, which is why they're all identical.  We just need to fix yo
2008-05-25T04:01:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	I missed the last part of your message there. So the problem is in /boot then? I'll just se if i can find an ext3 filesystemn viewer that way I wont need to reboot
2008-05-25T04:01:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	The problem is /boot/grub/menu.lst, which is the menu config file that tells GRUB how to boot everything, yeah.  Luckily, wecan edit it in place, at the menu itself.  We just need to do so.
2008-05-25T04:02:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	we just need to get to the GRUB menu, then we can edit it
2008-05-25T04:03:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	ok I'll reboot and write down what i get when i hit "e" be back in about 5 mins
2008-05-25T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	J-a-k-e	If you don't have a seond box, you can boot to an Ubuntu LiveCD and we can edit from that (and you can IRC from that too)
2008-05-25T04:06:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Flannel	Ok, I have chatzilla setup on my ubuntu drive so I think i'll reinstall grub and boot into there. I'll be back in about 7 mins
