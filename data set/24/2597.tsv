2008-11-08T19:30:00.000Z	mtozses_	Pe1o	I have no problems with that. but isn't id supposed to automount?
2008-11-08T19:31:00.000Z	Pe1o	mtozses_	it is , but is doesn't for some reason, so we'll try to mount it manualy and figure out the problem , I'm actualy guessing that the usb flash drive is borked , you might need to format it,  does it work in other computers ?
2008-11-08T19:32:00.000Z	mtozses_	Pe1o	yes it works in other computers
2008-11-08T19:32:00.000Z	Pe1o	mtozses_	 ok so try and mount it manualy then
2008-11-08T19:32:00.000Z	mtozses_	Pe1o	I did
2008-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	Pe1o	mtozses_	and ?
2008-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	mtozses_	Pe1o	it mounted fine
2008-11-08T19:34:00.000Z	Pe1o	mtozses_	ok so something else is not working ,  that's as far as I can take you ,  try searching the forum for usb automount ,  or some such ,  or ask here again ,  stating that it mounts manualy just not automaticaly
