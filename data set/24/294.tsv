2011-12-28T03:24:00.000Z	lordjj		Hello. My screen usually freezes when resuming from a screen saver, but I can switch to cli with cntrl+alt+f#. What can I do to recover the screen?
2011-12-28T03:25:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	press Control+Alt+F7
2011-12-28T03:25:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	that doesn't help.
2011-12-28T03:26:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	log in on the cli and then type "startx"
2011-12-28T03:26:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	neither does that
2011-12-28T03:26:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	Do you have the kill sequence enabled?
2011-12-28T03:27:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	not sure what that is
2011-12-28T03:27:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	Keyboard Layout --> Layouts --> Options... --> Key sequence to kill the X server
2011-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	you mean cntrl+alt+backspace to restart X?
2011-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	yes, but that logs me out.
2011-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	enable that and then you can use Control+Alt+Backspace to restart X
2011-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	it still occurs without screensaver, e.g: closing laptop lid and opening
2011-12-28T03:29:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	AMD gpu?
2011-12-28T03:29:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	no NVIDIA integrated graphics
2011-12-28T03:29:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	you have latest nvidia drivers installed?
2011-12-28T03:30:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	afaik, yes.
2011-12-28T03:30:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	from what is available in the 11.04 repos
2011-12-28T03:31:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	actually I think its not even Nvidia, "Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Memory"
2011-12-28T03:31:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	lspci | grep VGA
2011-12-28T03:32:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller
2011-12-28T03:32:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	(rev 07)
2011-12-28T03:32:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	upgrading to 11.10 might help because of newer drivers
2011-12-28T03:33:00.000Z	yumbo	lordjj	other than that you're probably out of luck
2011-12-28T03:33:00.000Z	lordjj	yumbo	is there a way to change resolution from cli?
