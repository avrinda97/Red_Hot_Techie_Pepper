2005-03-02T14:33:00.000Z	phigan		mount: Symbol `sys_siglist' has different size in shared object, onsider re-linking
2005-03-02T14:33:00.000Z	phigan		with mingetty, and several other apps as well
2005-03-02T14:34:00.000Z	phigan		i was thinking rebuilding glibc would take care of the problem, but I've updated gcc and it seems there are problems building glibc with latest gcc
2005-03-02T14:34:00.000Z	phigan		heh
2005-03-02T14:34:00.000Z	phigan		oh, that has nothin to do with ubuntu
2005-03-02T14:34:00.000Z	phigan		that's just whats up with my ibook
2005-03-02T14:35:00.000Z	phigan		so i was thinking of trying out a distro for once
2005-03-02T14:35:00.000Z	rattboi	phigan	I tried hoary live cd on my iBook G4
2005-03-02T14:35:00.000Z	phigan	rattboi	me too.. it looked pretty but it didn't always function :)
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	rattboi	phigan	what problems did you have?
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	phigan	rattboi	it locked up at least once, and one time it went to sleep and wouldn't wake up
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	rattboi		huh
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	rattboi		I had some goofyness with volume, as I remember
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	rattboi		and sleeping wasn't working
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	phigan		i was hoping it would have gcc :)
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	phigan		i don't think it does
2005-03-02T14:36:00.000Z	rattboi		at least, not by just closing the lid
2005-03-02T14:37:00.000Z	rattboi	phigan	you mean to program with?
2005-03-02T14:37:00.000Z	rattboi		apt-get install build-essentials
2005-03-02T14:37:00.000Z	phigan	rattboi	to rebuild glibc on my harddrive
2005-03-02T14:37:00.000Z	phigan	rattboi	You can apt-get while booted from the cd?
