2011-05-02T20:09:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	In the event where you cannot access a graphical interface, the command line should still work.
2011-05-02T20:10:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	I can still..I just wan't to reinstall the original packages without wiping everything. Is there a relatively simple way?
2011-05-02T20:10:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	Assuming the dependency check in place.. you can try to install the ubuntu-desktop package and hope that the relavent packages are pulled back in?
2011-05-02T20:11:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	What are the commands to do this?
2011-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2011-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	This is only an attempt and I can't gurantee the results.
2011-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Ok, could it result in loss?
2011-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	No, there is no chance of loss that I can tell, most it will do is nothing. That will not touch your /home
2011-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Ok, I'll give it a go
2011-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	Best case, original packages pulled in and restored, worst case, GUI dies data stays intact
2011-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	In LXDE if I try to pull up the udate manager I get - 'E:Type 'ain' is not known on line 3 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-natty.list'
2011-05-02T20:32:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	please pastebin this file too /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-natty.list

2011-05-02T20:35:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	Yes, you nailed, it, please make the correction to it? :)
2011-05-02T20:35:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Remove line 3?

2011-05-02T20:37:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	use a command line editor like nano or vi or vim
2011-05-02T20:38:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Ok
2011-05-02T20:38:00.000Z	Dcite	GuitarMan517	sudo vim /path/to/file
2011-05-02T20:45:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Ok, thats working. Ran ppa purge on the Gnome3 ppa
2011-05-02T20:46:00.000Z	GuitarMan517	Dcite	Should I try sudo aptget install ubuntu-desktop now?
