2009-06-17T19:30:00.000Z	J_A_X		anyone care to help me figure out why gradients looks so choppy compared to windows?
2009-06-17T19:31:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	what video card do you have and have you installed the restricted drivers for it?
2009-06-17T19:31:00.000Z	J_A_X		nvidia 8400, and yes
2009-06-17T19:31:00.000Z	J_A_X		it looks like if the settings were brought down to 16bit color instead of 24 or something
2009-06-17T19:32:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	what do you mean by choppy?
2009-06-17T19:32:00.000Z	J_A_X		like I said, looks like if it's missing color depth
2009-06-17T19:32:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	16bit and 24bit shouldn't look that different
2009-06-17T19:33:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	have you tried running nvidia-settings (I think thats the proper name)
2009-06-17T19:34:00.000Z	J_A_X	Halitech	doing it right now
2009-06-17T19:35:00.000Z	J_A_X		it's at depth 24...
2009-06-17T19:35:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	not sure then, I've got an ATI card currently
2009-06-17T19:36:00.000Z	J_A_X	Halitech	well, my laptop has an ati, and it does the same thing
2009-06-17T19:36:00.000Z	J_A_X		:/
2009-06-17T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	can you post a screen shot?
2009-06-17T19:41:00.000Z	J_A_X	Halitech	http://imagebin.ca/view/qRHfrMFP.html
2009-06-17T19:41:00.000Z	J_A_X		that gradient is suppose to be all smooth
2009-06-17T19:41:00.000Z	J_A_X		it works great in windows, just not in linux
2009-06-17T19:42:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	looks like a solid black image to me
2009-06-17T19:42:00.000Z	J_A_X		you don't see the gradient?!
2009-06-17T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	no, just a full black for some reason
2009-06-17T19:43:00.000Z	J_A_X	Halitech	then your color setup is even more messed than mine
2009-06-17T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	all my other colors work, I'm trying it in opera to see what happens there
2009-06-17T19:44:00.000Z	J_A_X		yeah
2009-06-17T19:44:00.000Z	Halitech	J_A_X	no, even in opera it looks black
