2009-02-26T00:20:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	the nice thing about grub is you have a chance to recover by using the grub command line.
2009-02-26T00:20:00.000Z	areay		i can't boot into ubuntu, i'm getting a grub error 21/
2009-02-26T00:21:00.000Z	areay		sh** sorry
2009-02-26T00:21:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	i've tried loads of stuff but nothing's working... i followed like 9 different blogs
2009-02-26T00:22:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	its all cuz i needed to copy my main filesystem from one hdd to another...
2009-02-26T00:23:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	i've copied all the partitions as needed but obviously grub is messed up because of the different disk
2009-02-26T00:23:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	here's my menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu.com/122958/ I'm not sure if that's even the file i should be looking in for this but i think it is
2009-02-26T00:24:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	someone pasted the following a little while ago --> ï»¿See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
2009-02-26T00:25:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	I can't check the link you posted at the moment. My ubuntu install is a bit unstable when it comes to the GUI side of things and I've just lost firefox until I reboot.
2009-02-26T00:26:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	ahh i see... can i paste it in a pm?
2009-02-26T00:26:00.000Z	Plugh		sure.
2009-02-26T00:27:00.000Z	Plugh		I should really do a fresh install of Ubuntu on this new machine but it always says it will update the partition tables of the HD and I don't want it doing that since it could mean I lose the contents of some of my other existing partitions.
2009-02-26T00:29:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	So far, all but two lines of the file you are sending me are commented out.
2009-02-26T00:30:00.000Z	Plugh		oops... closed wrong tab
2009-02-26T00:31:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	sorry it's long and there's loads of comments... i think it's just the default file...
2009-02-26T00:31:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	yea sorry
2009-02-26T00:31:00.000Z	Plugh		it looks that way.
2009-02-26T00:37:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	I don't like using uuid's in grub. I prefer to use the device names.
2009-02-26T00:39:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	which partition contains your boot files?
2009-02-26T00:40:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	do i use the format /dev/* or (hdX,Y)? the partition i need to boot from is /dev/sda5
2009-02-26T00:40:00.000Z	Plugh	areay	(hd0,4)
2009-02-26T00:41:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	ok so i just change wherever it says the uuid to hd0,4
2009-02-26T00:41:00.000Z	areay	Plugh	whats the property name instead of "uuid"?
