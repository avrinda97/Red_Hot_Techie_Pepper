2007-08-26T16:17:00.000Z	Optimus55		hey i'm looking for some advice. i have beryl installed and configured but i want to switch to the new compiz fusion. what's the best way to go about doing that?
2007-08-26T16:17:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	don't. that's my advise
2007-08-26T16:18:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	I switched over two days ago and it was nothing but buggy buggy buggy..
2007-08-26T16:19:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	you will crash your desktop, guarantee. and also it leaves an update of 0B that never goes away no matter what. its a pain in the ass
2007-08-26T16:19:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	wow. you sure you're not having an isolated case? i'm going to check the forums. what gfx card do you have?
2007-08-26T16:20:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	I'm sure. you can have some fun trying it out, but I'm just lettin' you know.. I'll see you in here asking for help soon!
2007-08-26T16:21:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	lol...
2007-08-26T16:22:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	at the same time I was asking for help with that stuff there was two other people in there with the same problems...
2007-08-26T16:22:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	what vid card u have? also, what did you end up doing?
2007-08-26T16:23:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	built in intel video, and I ended up going back to beryl
2007-08-26T16:23:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	it wasn't a video card issue because every now and again it would work, the PROGRAM was buggy, know what I mean
2007-08-26T16:24:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	the only thing I noticed was it was much much harder to install and there wasn't much of any benefit except that cool burning writing. I would wait till it's developed a bit personally
2007-08-26T16:24:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	yeh. is beryl in beta also? what i'm really interested in is the window switching effects, where you can line the whole cube out and drag programs from one screen to the next
2007-08-26T16:25:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	I am doing that now with beryl...
2007-08-26T16:25:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	any way to get those effect in beryl?
2007-08-26T16:26:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	how do i get the new compiz fusion window switching effects in beryl? some kind of patch?
2007-08-26T16:27:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	no man, compiz fusion is compiz and beryl
2007-08-26T16:27:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	beryl is what does that effect
2007-08-26T16:27:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	beryl is what does that effect...
2007-08-26T16:27:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	open your beryl manager
2007-08-26T16:27:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	right...
2007-08-26T16:28:00.000Z	nathan__	Optimus55	is it open?
2007-08-26T16:29:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	check pm
2007-08-26T16:30:00.000Z	Optimus55	nathan__	what after the cube?
