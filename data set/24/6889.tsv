2005-06-22T14:39:00.000Z	zyth		how do I add games to my games menu? Pingus, Supertux, and Tuxracer were all evil and didn't add themselves to my menus
2005-06-22T14:40:00.000Z	zyth		smeg?
2005-06-22T14:40:00.000Z	zyth		what is it?
2005-06-22T14:41:00.000Z	zyth		hm, I have backports, but I don't see it in synaptic.
2005-06-22T14:42:00.000Z	zyth		http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net/hoary-extras ?
2005-06-22T14:44:00.000Z	zyth		got the deb
2005-06-22T14:44:00.000Z	zyth		dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of smeg:
2005-06-22T14:44:00.000Z	zyth		 smeg depends on python-xdg (>= 0.14); however:
2005-06-22T14:44:00.000Z	zyth		  Version of python-xdg on system is 0.9-1.
2005-06-22T14:44:00.000Z	zyth		ugh
2005-06-22T14:45:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	how did you manage to get that?
2005-06-22T14:45:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	tried to install smeg.
2005-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	no
2005-06-22T14:55:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	ok, I'll remove backports now that smeg is installed
2005-07-02T06:41:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	fortunately, pcmcia exists.
2005-07-02T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	yeah, that's a pain in the ass, too
2005-07-02T07:06:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	I moved libGL.a to libGL.a.bak for now to see if it works... if not, I haven't irrevocably broken anything at least
2005-07-02T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	yeah
2005-07-02T07:06:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	and oddly, it seems to be working :/
2005-07-02T09:14:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	there is no one there
2005-07-31T13:19:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	in all seriousness, the ONLY good IDE I've ever used was TurboPascal/Turbo C's DOS one.
2005-07-31T13:19:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	that was quite a nice one
2005-07-31T13:19:00.000Z	bob2	zyth	before I found emacs, anyway ;p
2005-07-31T13:20:00.000Z	zyth	bob2	eh, I use vi or nano.  Never learned much beyond how to open, edit, and save a file in emacs
