2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	:-( only for windows
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	then use gvim
2012-01-03T18:27:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	emacs
2012-01-03T18:28:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	way too intimidating. what are my options
2012-01-03T18:28:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	you said "good"
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	you can also use eclipse, gedit, notepad++
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	i didn't said BEST
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	if you asked for the best editor, of course the answer would be vim :)
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	a, gvim, it has a gui :)
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	didn't knew notepad++ was available for Linux
2012-01-03T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	imo i saw it for linux
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	okies
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	or maybe have a look at "kate" too, i like it very much, or gedit
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	but if you want a REAL editor there are only emacs and vim for powerfull things
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	gedit is my current editor...
2012-01-03T18:31:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	agree
2012-01-03T18:34:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	for a powerfull IDE you could have a look at "eclipse" not everyones favoritie but a powerfull IDE
2012-01-03T18:39:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	is kate available only for KDE
2012-01-03T18:39:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	no for every desktop
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	all packages/programs in the ubuntu repos can be used with every desktop
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	thanks a lot
2012-01-03T18:40:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	but of course some programs pulling some libs with them
2012-01-03T18:41:00.000Z	iceroot	NimeshNeema	e.g. kate will install some kde-basic libs but that is not a problem for your system, just a little more space is needed
2012-01-03T18:42:00.000Z	NimeshNeema	iceroot	will give a try
