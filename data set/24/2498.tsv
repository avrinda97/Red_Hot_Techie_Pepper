2008-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	mrwes		can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? : bill@bill-laptop:~$ sshfs bill@desktop: /home/bill /media/desktop/
2008-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	mrwes		bill@192.168.1.101's password:
2008-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	mrwes		fuse: invalid argument `/media/desktop/'
2008-12-13T03:39:00.000Z	mrwes		I added myself to the fuse group
2008-12-13T03:39:00.000Z	mrwes		logged out and back in
2008-12-13T03:40:00.000Z	mrwes		bump..heh
2008-12-13T03:41:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	What are you trying to do?
2008-12-13T03:41:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	mount my /home from my desktop to my laptop via sshfs
2008-12-13T03:42:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	You have an extra space between the server host and the path
2008-12-13T03:43:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	bingo! man...I would have never caught that one!
2008-12-13T03:43:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	anyway to do that at boot up and get around the password entry?
2008-12-13T03:46:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	You should be able to specify an option in your fstab for the credentials file.
2008-12-13T03:47:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	yah I just read that on-line, about putting the line in my /etc/fstab
2009-03-27T17:21:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	I'm aware of that
2009-03-27T17:21:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	Then you should have mentioned that we do not support it.
2009-03-27T17:21:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	The bot took care of that :)
2009-05-08T17:01:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	he's not -- he's going from Intrepid to Jaunty
2009-05-08T17:03:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	hrmm...well salvatore_ can't get the distro upgrade from Intrepid to Jaunty
2009-06-16T19:51:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	No.
2009-06-16T19:52:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	didn't think so, makes MS Server 2003 remote desktop difficult :(
2009-06-16T19:53:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	Use the remote-desktop client if you're conencting to a terminal server or rdp connection
2009-06-16T19:54:00.000Z	mrwes	Pici	k...I'll try to set that up
2010-05-07T23:54:00.000Z	Pici	mrwes	Please mind your language here.
