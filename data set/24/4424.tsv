2007-04-19T16:51:00.000Z	Riesen		it's jsut the cd i burned.
2007-04-19T16:51:00.000Z	Riesen		using the lil install manager, told it to isntall, and it takes forever, then screams an io error at me
2007-04-19T16:52:00.000Z	Riesen		it had jsut finished a 5 minute loading of the ubuntu progress screen (blakc boot screen with scrolling orange status bar)
2007-04-19T16:53:00.000Z	Riesen		also.. is there a default user / password for lviecd versions?

2007-04-19T16:53:00.000Z	Riesen		heh, not working.
2007-04-19T16:54:00.000Z	Riesen		ellisd, after about 6 mintues of idling, i got to a login, seems like live cd booted fine
2007-04-19T16:54:00.000Z	Riesen		but the login isn't accepting a blank login
2007-04-19T16:54:00.000Z	Riesen		it's requiring a username
2007-04-19T16:55:00.000Z	Riesen		*so there's no defaulted username / password.
2007-04-19T16:56:00.000Z	defrysk	Riesen	sudo blah passwd <enter>
2007-04-19T16:56:00.000Z	Riesen		wait, what?
