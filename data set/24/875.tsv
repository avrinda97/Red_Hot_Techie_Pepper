2010-12-14T04:24:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 it's cool :)
2010-12-14T04:20:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	i am planning to download/compile (learning to at least) a program.  i have read the documentation explaining the dependencies of the application i am installing.  how can i check my system to determine if a) i already have the dependent program and b) if its the correct version?
2010-12-14T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	not sure, check the deps of the package
2010-12-14T04:22:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 the package wouldn't describe the command i am looking for.  thanks anyway.
2010-12-14T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	i have no idea about your issue so I didn't reply to any of it. What did you expect?
2010-12-14T04:24:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 I asked a question; your reply wasn't in regards to what i asked.  I simply thanked you for the reply.  Nothing more than that.
2010-12-14T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	i see, sorry
2010-12-15T04:48:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	is the man when it come to MD5; helped me to understand it quickly
2010-12-18T04:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	pae gives 32bit kernels access to up to 64Gb RAM
2010-12-18T04:09:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	let me ask this, how much ram can desktop v10.10 64 bit handle?
2010-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	in theory 4 Exabytes
2010-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 wow!  lol
2010-12-18T04:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	I think theres some paging stuff or something that needs to happen so its a bit less but its still silly amounts of ram
2010-12-18T04:11:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 i just need something to take advantage of 8gb :()
2010-12-18T04:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	Current implementations of the AMD64 architecture (starting from AMD 10h microarchitecture) extend this to 48-bit physical addresses[9] and therefore can address up to 256 TB of RAM

2010-12-18T04:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	pae kernel or 64bit, either is fine. Some 3rd party companys only support 32bit (like brother and Canon for printers for example)
2010-12-18T04:16:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 is changing my kernel to PAE something a noob can do?
2010-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	just install the linux-image-pae package and you'll have it
2010-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	kcorcoran	ActionParsnip	 would that be your recommendation vs installing 64bit?
2011-05-09T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	how do you mean?
2011-05-09T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	once you install the nvidia driver, the x server will use the nvidia driver by default....
2011-05-09T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kcorcoran	try:  sudo nvidia-xconfig     then startx
