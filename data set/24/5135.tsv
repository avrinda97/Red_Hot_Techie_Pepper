2008-01-06T08:42:00.000Z	canerunner		I need some help with a WiFi problem on 7.10. Anyone familiar?
2008-01-06T08:43:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	what is the issue?
2008-01-06T08:43:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	kindly respond to me prefix with my nick or i will miss your responses
2008-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	how do you determine of what you said, see the gateway and gateway sees your wifi?
2008-01-06T08:46:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	what tool or command do you use to say it sees both ways?
2008-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	okay, when you type iwconfig it shows as associated ? does the nic card gets an ip address?
2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	what is the ip address you get from the AP dhcp server?
2008-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	does your AP/gateway have a dhcp server?
2008-01-06T08:55:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	you can try this command instead of using static...  dhclient wlan0  to acquire an ip address
2008-01-06T08:57:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	i assume it was wlan0  ..use the name you get from iwconfig
2008-01-06T08:59:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	 its either wlan0 or eth0 or wlan1 or eth1 or whatever nic name
2008-01-06T09:01:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	did it work?
2008-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	pastebin  the result of your iwconfig
2008-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	well how many interfaces it recognize when you type iwconfig.. also take the time to pastebin it, i am taking my time to assist you, so do your part
2008-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	this is on same computer you are on? why do you need to have both nics activated?
2008-01-06T09:09:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	okay lets do it like this.. type iwconfig  and tell me how many interfaces does it say it has wireless?
2008-01-06T09:10:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	and if you type ifconfig , how many names show up? what are they?
2008-01-06T09:12:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	when you type  iwlist eth1 scan  how strong is the signal from your AP..it should be listed
2008-01-06T09:14:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	thats strong enuff..what is the contents of your /etc/network/interfaces ?
2008-01-06T09:20:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	you are running wep or wap? can you disable that in your AP also?  see if you can connect in the clear first before going to encrypted
2008-01-06T09:26:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	good, so its the encrypted part thats screwing things up ... stay encrypted..you dont have that many nosy neighbors right?
2008-01-06T09:27:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	right..so go uncrypted for a while..
2008-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	okay good luck
2008-01-06T09:29:00.000Z	bulmer	canerunner	you're welcome, you can comeback and share your knowledge next time :)
