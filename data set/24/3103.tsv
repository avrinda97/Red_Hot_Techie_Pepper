2008-07-22T11:37:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		Q: I have a Creative Labs card; under Preferences/Sound I can click Test and get a beep, but can't play an mp3. Can someone help???
2008-07-22T11:38:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		This isnt restricted to mp3s. The audio file 'plays' but i cant HEAR anything.
2008-07-22T11:39:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	please try to install the codecs... if that still doesn't work, come back.
2008-07-22T11:39:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	Many people here have been using Linux for longer than Ubuntu has even existed, we know what we're talking about  ;)
2008-07-22T11:49:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	Just try to play something again...
2008-07-22T11:50:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	lspci | grep -i audio ?

2008-07-22T11:52:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	- results are in ---->
2008-07-22T11:52:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	ahh... which do you want to use?
2008-07-22T11:56:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	how is that relevant?
2008-07-22T11:57:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	its information pertinent to my install
2008-07-22T11:57:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	You never answered my question, which do you want to use?
2008-07-22T12:00:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	i wish to employ the audio services of the Ensoniq branded sound card.
2008-07-22T12:02:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	ok... 'lsmod | grep snd' <-- throw that output on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-07-22T12:04:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	http://paste.ubuntu.com/29221/
2008-07-22T12:05:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	ok... echo 'blacklist snd-ens1371' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist ... then restart
2008-07-22T12:05:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	K.
2008-07-22T12:19:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	ok, so now my Ensoniq card, the one i wanted to use, isnt listed.
2008-07-22T12:19:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	no Test beep, nothing.
2008-07-22T12:20:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	doh... I'm dumb... nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist ... go to the very bottom, change snd-enswhatever to snd-intel8x0 and reboot... I'm helping a lot of people, got confused
2008-07-22T12:29:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	Hey the audio works - thanks so much! So what we did was to blacklist the 'other' card?
2008-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	Yes... your system was getting confused because 2 cards wanted the same device.
2008-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fde	ah gotcha. Well, Thanks again :)
2008-07-22T12:30:00.000Z	fde	nicholaspaul	So we just told the system to ignore the onboard (I'm guessing?)
