2012-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats		Hi #ubuntu, I'm having an issue with my video card, namely that the screen goes blank often unless nomodeset is set.
2012-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats		I'm using an asus zenbook with some sort of onboard intel (i915)
2012-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	which of the ZenBooks? My wife has one.
2012-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	ux21e I think
2012-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	she has the 13 inch, is that the new Ivy-Bridge one, or prior to?
2012-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	I'm not sure actually, been a while since I looked at this box
2012-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	okay, so it's older. Hang a sec.
2012-06-06T20:20:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	yeah it is, thanks!
2012-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	so, I don't think it'd be...well, look here at the Power Saving Optimizations (or all of it, rather), maybe this will help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbook
2012-06-06T20:22:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	yeah I followed that guide when I set it up. I've messed a bit with the powersaving options but not a lot
2012-06-06T20:22:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	check with those, I don't know exactly what the i915.semaphores=1 does, but may help?
2012-06-06T20:23:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	I'll play with it :)
2012-06-06T20:23:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	in your /etc/default/grub
2012-06-06T20:23:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	huh, interesting.
2012-06-06T20:24:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	I found a couple posts from people with the same issue, but not much in the way of solutions :s
2012-06-06T20:24:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	on the forums? can I see the link?
2012-06-06T20:24:00.000Z	SuddenlyTophats	h00k	I'll see what I can find, was on a different install when I was searching.
2012-06-06T20:25:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	I can confirm that on my Wife's ux31e (or whatever the 13" is), she only has the weird Sentelic touchpad issue. I wonder why it's different.
2012-06-06T20:25:00.000Z	h00k	SuddenlyTophats	on 12.04 that is
