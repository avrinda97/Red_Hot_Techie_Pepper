2005-10-26T15:42:00.000Z	dazvid	bob2	I was hoping it would be the nvidia-glx one from the repos. However X isnt starting correctly when I modify the xorg.conf
2005-10-26T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	dazvid	modinfo nvidia
2005-10-26T15:43:00.000Z	dazvid	bob2	That gives me a lot of info, however not the actual version number
