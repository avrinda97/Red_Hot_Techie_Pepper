2011-08-15T21:01:00.000Z	TheWarden		Hi, when a Ubuntu system boots up at times if not properly shutdown it will do a file system check and may prompt for user input. Is there a way to assume the answer to the prompts so no user interaction is required at this stage?
2011-08-15T21:02:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	If it is prompting you for input, you more-than-likely have problems with that drive.
2011-08-15T21:03:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	okay, but doesn't it prompt to repair or skip, etc? I want to set the default response so no user interaction is required.
2011-08-15T21:03:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	Oh, sorry, I see that you said when 'not properly shutdown". Well same issue.  WHen the plug was pulled, file-system errors occured and it needs your permission to fix them.  You should quit pulling the plug.
2011-08-15T21:04:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	lol funny... power outage does the same thing. So how can one set the responses for those prompts?
2011-08-15T21:04:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	If you have power outages, you should get a UPS.  (This is a desktop PC, right?)
2011-08-15T21:05:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	I don't have control over the environment... these devices running Ubuntu do not have a keyboard or mouse and is remotely administrated. I need to set default responses for those type of prompts.
2011-08-15T21:06:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	no its not a desktop pc... it is used in an application environment or says as a STB (set-top-box)..
2011-08-15T21:06:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	I see.  Let look and see if I can find an answer. (I don't know.)
2011-08-15T21:06:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	I've been searching online for an answer but no luck so far.
2011-08-15T21:09:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	Looking at http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bypassing-fsck/ but not really applicable
2011-08-15T21:11:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	Actually, the above URL may contain the correct method, adding to the end of the kernel line....
2011-08-15T21:12:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	 "Force fsck on boot using /forcefsck"
2011-08-15T21:17:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	interesting but those solutions a to either skip or bypass file system check. I want to still have file system check but with default responses when it prompts to eliminate user interaction.
2011-08-15T21:18:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	But the bottom line is that a server farm that does not have backup power (generator) / and / or ups's  is not a good very good server farm.  (Especially if it is in an area where there are power-outages often.
2011-08-15T21:18:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	Yea, I know. Not really relevant.  But was thiking...
2011-08-15T21:19:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	yes I agree with you but I have to deal with reality. Reality is not everyone will get or understand the importance of a UPS. These systems are not owned my me nor do I have physically control over them. I just want to give answers to the prompts... as nothing is more annonying then having a prompt sit there and not fully bootup cause its waiting for someone to answer.
2011-08-15T21:19:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	... that It may be a clue as to a method of some other sort, because I just don't know how to alter fsck  intervention at boot time.
2011-08-15T21:20:00.000Z	TheWarden		when no one is there watching it to be answered.
2011-08-15T21:20:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	oh okay, well thanks for your help.
2011-08-15T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	Still checking tho
2011-08-15T21:21:00.000Z	TheWarden	usr13	as am I still searching :), thanks.
2011-08-15T21:21:00.000Z	usr13	TheWarden	See my PM
