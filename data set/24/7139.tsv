2005-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	i doubt it...when you buy home hardware you are usually buying into someone's sucker plan
2005-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	that is why everybody likes linux...it is free from all those entrapments
2005-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	steve33	whiskers	no offense, but you are kind of wasting my time. I want to compress the dvd to play on my home player
2005-04-16T07:13:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	well first you need to know what formats your home player restricts you too.
2005-04-16T07:14:00.000Z	steve33	whiskers	all I want is to backup the dvd, compress it and copy it
2005-04-16T07:15:00.000Z	steve33	whiskers	backup I got down

2005-04-16T07:39:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	well it is illegal in the US
2005-04-16T07:41:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	no you cannot even back them up because it is illegal to break DeCss
2005-04-16T07:41:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	that is why linux is so popular
2005-04-16T07:43:00.000Z	whiskers	steve33	you are like that guy with 2000 ripped oggs.....that stuff is illegal in the US
