2007-09-20T09:13:00.000Z	meTed		greetings all :) how can I go back to normal user after i "sudoed"; i'm trying to compare my paths (i.e, echo $PATH)
2007-09-20T09:14:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	"exit"
2007-09-20T09:15:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	 thank you; is there a way to do it without quiting the terminal session?
2007-09-20T09:15:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Oh wait.. It quits? If you do a "sudo" command, you are only super-user for that one command
2007-09-20T09:16:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	from my experience you remain sudo for some predetermined time; sudo eventually times out
2007-09-20T09:17:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	For example, sudo apt-get install irssi - WIll install irssi and leave the sudo sesssion.
2007-09-20T09:18:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	well i hear what you're saying but I just launched terminal again and ran echo $PATH and I still gives me root's path.
2007-09-20T09:19:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Then 'exit' should exit root user and not the terminal
2007-09-20T09:19:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	well, i just did that and it closed the terminal :)
2007-09-20T09:19:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Well I just did it and it didn't, so you have something else going on..
2007-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Try 'logout', it should give you -->bash: logout: not login shell: use `exit'
2007-09-20T09:21:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	bash: logout: not login shell: use `exit'
2007-09-20T09:21:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	THen do what it sais =)
2007-09-20T09:22:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	If it exits, something is configured incorrectly.
2007-09-20T09:22:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	it's probably user error lol
2007-09-20T09:23:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Hehe
2007-09-20T09:23:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	is this root's path /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games ?
2007-09-20T09:23:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	What I like to do is run everything in Screen, then I have one tab (titled root) auto start, and I use all my root hackign in that window, never have to leave and never have to close it up
2007-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	O.o That doesn't sound right :-P
2007-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	is that normal user's path?
2007-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	The path should be /home/user
2007-09-20T09:25:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	no i mean command search path (i.e, echo $PATH)
2007-09-20T09:26:00.000Z	sixpence	meTed	Oh, that I have no idea about
2007-09-20T09:27:00.000Z	meTed	sixpence	thank you i'll play around with it :)
