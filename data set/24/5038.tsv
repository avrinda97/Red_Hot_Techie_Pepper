2006-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	what do you want to do?
2006-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	when a copy to /usr/include , the type of my files become: Link(with problems)
2006-11-06T17:00:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	do you want to copy the entire directory or just a file?
2006-11-06T17:00:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	the entire directory
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	where do you want to copy /usr/include to? the files in /usr/include probably will not work in another location
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	im using cp -R /home/..../ /usr/include
2006-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	im copying to /usr/include
2006-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	you need a wildcard....cp -R /home/Nativow/temp/* /usr/include
2006-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	let me try
2006-11-07T17:03:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	be careful or you might end up with a bunch of stuff in /usr/include
2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	I would suggest testing first in a temp directory to make sure you know exactly how it will work
2006-11-07T17:07:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	same thing is happening...  =/
2006-11-07T17:07:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	what is the error message?
2006-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	you also need to run the cp command as root.....'sudo cp .....'
2006-11-07T17:09:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	there is no error when i copy. The problem is that in the properties of the files I copied its written link(with problem) in the /usr/include but not in my source directory
2006-11-07T17:09:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	and because of this, i can not include these files in my programs
2006-11-07T17:10:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	sounds like the cp can't work because bad links are already there. Try deleting one of the bad links then do the copy
2006-11-07T17:11:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	are you sure you don't need to cp those files to another directory? pointed to by the bad links?
2006-11-07T17:13:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	these files are libraries that i want to be able to include in my C programs. So i need to cp them to /usr/include right?
2006-11-07T17:14:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	maybe they already exist and are linked in /usr/include from someplace else.
2006-11-07T17:14:00.000Z	Nativow	odin	hum.. maybe you are right.. ill check it
2006-11-07T17:15:00.000Z	odin	Nativow	where does one of those problem links point? Check that directory to see if the file is already there
