2008-05-22T14:32:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/13804/
2008-05-22T14:32:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	that seems to tell you what to do
2008-05-22T14:33:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	yep, but I've just one version of virtualbox and if i reinstall, it doesn't work either
2008-05-22T14:34:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	i think that's why i first installed the binaries of the non free version
2008-05-22T14:34:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	throught a deb package
2008-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	which version of ubuntu are you using, and are you trying to run the propriatary or the free version?
2008-05-22T14:36:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	and which version of virtualbox?
2008-05-22T14:37:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	firs i tried to run the non free version, but it doesn't appear in my menu neither in synaptic list
2008-05-22T14:37:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	virtualbox 1.5.6
2008-05-22T14:38:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	yea, so according to some quick internet research, ubuntu hardy includes packages for the free version of virtual box already installed.  So when you installed the propriatary, you probably never uninstalled the free version.  Hence the error claiming you're getting a conflict running both types
2008-05-22T14:39:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	fine, how to remove both?
2008-05-22T14:40:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	I have no personal experience with virtualbox, but I'd imagine starting with synaptic and see if you can find anything
2008-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	no... what?  there's only one instance of vb-ose?  you removed the proprietary already?
2008-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	no, the proprietary doesn't appear
2008-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	didn't ever appear
2008-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	the proprietary is 1.6
2008-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	well since you seem to want to use the proprietary (right?), i'd guess I'd remove the vb-ose from where you found it in syneptic
2008-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	then check if proprietary is willing to run yet
2008-05-22T14:46:00.000Z	LegolasFaol	ep103	how should i run virtualbox if ther's not on the menu? the comand "virtualbox" doesn't work
2008-05-22T14:50:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	have you tried InnoTek VirtualBox
2008-05-22T14:50:00.000Z	ep103	LegolasFaol	in the alt+F2
