2012-06-30T01:01:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	+ MonkeyDust, right. I can login using "startx" just fine, but I have to open a console and type it manually (and it opens on F8). However, whenever I boot an Xubuntu load screen appears, never reaches the login prompt though (F7). Any more questions?
2012-06-30T01:02:00.000Z	L3top	vjacob	cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
2012-06-30T01:02:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	"lightdm"
2012-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	L3top	vjacob	and you are not using lightdm?
2012-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	vjacob		I am not sure if I am or should be.
2012-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	I might add that I tried a number of different environments but ended up trying to remove all but MATE
2012-06-30T01:03:00.000Z	L3top		xubuntu uses xfce. Ubuntu uses unity/lightdm vjacob
2012-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	hmmm you seem to have a point there... I take it :)
2012-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	L3top	vjacob	You will want to find the mate equiv of what is actually in the file I asked you to cat.
2012-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	vjacob		I did install XFCE, I removed Unity and I am trying to run mate.
2012-06-30T01:05:00.000Z	L3top		and change it using sudo/gksudo depending on your editor vjacob
2012-06-30T01:05:00.000Z	vjacob		(I also removed XFCE and other environments except MATE to the best of my knowledge)
2012-06-30T01:05:00.000Z	vjacob		ok
2012-06-30T01:05:00.000Z	vjacob		I wonder how to find out what that is called
2012-06-30T01:06:00.000Z	L3top	vjacob	it is probably in the same place as lightdm. ls /usr/bin/mat*
2012-06-30T01:06:00.000Z	vjacob		ahh
2012-06-30T01:07:00.000Z	vjacob		mate-session or mate-wm?
2012-06-30T01:07:00.000Z	L3top		I dunno vjacob. I don't use mate
2012-06-30T01:07:00.000Z	L3top	vjacob	I would login, and call each and see what they do.
2012-06-30T01:10:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	you, sir, brillian]
2012-06-30T01:10:00.000Z	vjacob		unlike me who type ] instead of !
2012-06-30T01:12:00.000Z	L3top		Glad you got going vjacob :)
2012-06-30T01:12:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	thank you for saving me from the torment that is Dr Who...
2012-06-30T01:15:00.000Z	vjacob	L3top	 cheers for now]
