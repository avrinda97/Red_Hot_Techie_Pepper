2006-03-02T06:44:00.000Z	jdmpike		are there mount improvements in Dapper - I am not a fan of the automount in breezy
2006-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	jdmpike		have I been silenced?
2006-03-02T06:46:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	i think not
2006-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	you probably have to make an entry in fstab
2006-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	and does it work?
2006-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	but it mounts as 'root' and 'root' is the owner, with perms set to 775, so I can't write to it
2006-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	that doesn't happen here
2006-03-02T06:51:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	I have tried to 'sudo chgrp -R users /media/usbdisk' but I can't do that because I am not the owner...
2006-03-02T06:51:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	ok, I will give that a go
2006-03-02T06:52:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	but as far as i know you don't need an entry at all, and the whole system will automagicly mount it. correctly. at least i never had no right problems with usb sticks.
2006-03-02T06:56:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	this is the new line in /etc/fstab - /dev/sdc1       /media/usbdisk  vfat iocharset=utf8,uid=1000,umask=000 0 0
2006-03-02T06:56:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	i don't think the umask matters.
2006-03-02T06:58:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	can you show me the line with 'user' in it for your /etc/fstab?
2006-03-02T07:01:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	that still doesn't do it...
2006-03-02T07:01:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	I don't know why I can't get this
2006-03-02T07:02:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	like i said, usb stick always work here, without a line is fstab.
2006-03-02T07:02:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	this is a usb hd
2006-03-02T07:02:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	same for usb hd
2006-03-02T07:02:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	what do you think I could have messed up?
2006-03-02T07:03:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	not much clue
2006-03-02T07:05:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	let me plug in my usb hd
2006-03-02T07:08:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	just tested it on my breezy box, and works perfectly. its mounts the usb hd with the uid of the currently logged in (on X) user
2006-03-02T07:09:00.000Z	jdmpike	spacey	mine doesn't do that - If I just plug it in, dmesg just writes that something new is there
2006-03-02T07:11:00.000Z	spacey	jdmpike	don't know. maybe file a support ticket in launchpad?
