2005-05-13T16:23:00.000Z	ChrisH_		ok folks, I need some major help
2005-05-13T16:23:00.000Z	ChrisH_		my PS/2 mouse does not work
2005-05-13T16:23:00.000Z	ChrisH_		anything I try to make it work is failing
2005-05-13T16:23:00.000Z	ChrisH_		clean install of kubuntu, first boot and nothing
2005-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	ChrisH_		I throw myself upon your combined wisdom
2005-05-13T16:26:00.000Z	ChrisH_		right now I'm using my gf's laptop because it's so cumbersome to do anything on my machine
2005-05-13T16:26:00.000Z	ChrisH_		my mouse can work as USB too, but I tried a clean install and it didn't work then either
2005-05-13T16:27:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	Drako60, what does the command "grep psaux /etc/X11/xorg.conf" output?
2005-05-13T16:27:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	:  Section "InputDevice"
2005-05-13T16:28:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	I don't think that was the output... Don't paste that stuff in here please.
2005-05-13T16:28:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	?
2005-05-13T16:28:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	Hmm.. Well I think /dev/input/mice is for USB.
2005-05-13T16:29:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	Don't flood the channel with multiline pastes is all I'm saying.
2005-05-13T16:29:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	ah, it's plugged in USB now,
2005-05-13T16:29:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	Is it USB or PS2?
2005-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	when I had it as PS/2 it was /dev/psaux
2005-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	Your mouse. PS/2 or USB?
2005-05-13T16:31:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	it's a USB mouse, which came with a PS/2 adaptor that I'm using
2005-05-13T16:31:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	You would rather use USB though? If so, yank that adapter :)
2005-05-13T16:32:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	I just want to work!
2005-05-13T16:32:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	I've tried another USB mouse with it and that didn't work either
2005-05-13T16:33:00.000Z	dcraven	ChrisH_	try a different USB port.
2005-05-13T16:38:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	ok, I've now tried 2 different mice in ALL my USB ports, and none of them work
2005-05-13T16:39:00.000Z	ChrisH_	dcraven	although the LED on one did come one briefly before going off again
