2009-11-28T19:59:00.000Z	tilt		I want to bind a modifier key <Shift> to some xinput device
2009-11-28T20:00:00.000Z	tilt		is there a gnome program that does that?
2009-11-28T20:00:00.000Z	tilt		like "manage input devices"?
2009-11-28T20:02:00.000Z	decora	tilt	sorry, no idea. never owned an xinput device
2009-11-28T20:02:00.000Z	tilt	decora	well

2009-11-28T20:03:00.000Z	decora	tilt	i must admit here, that i have in fact, from time to time, used a 'mouse'
2009-11-28T20:04:00.000Z	tilt	decora	do "xinput list" ;D
2009-11-28T20:05:00.000Z	decora	tilt	lol, ok.... so what exactly do you mean by 'bind' the shift key to the device?
2009-11-28T20:05:00.000Z	tilt	decora	well
2009-11-28T20:06:00.000Z	tilt	decora	I have this drawing tablet
2009-11-28T20:06:00.000Z	tilt	decora	and it has "special keys"
2009-11-28T20:06:00.000Z	tilt	decora	one of those keys I want ot make act like a shift key
2009-11-28T20:06:00.000Z	decora	tilt	ohhhhhhhhhhhh
2009-11-28T20:06:00.000Z	tilt	decora	it's a key, basically, I can press and release it, X11 sees it, too, so basically no problem
2009-11-28T20:07:00.000Z	tilt		I knowhow to do it on the cmdline
2009-11-28T20:07:00.000Z	tilt		I just wondered if there is a GUI program by now that does that
2009-11-28T20:07:00.000Z	decora	tilt	are you using gnome?
2009-11-28T20:07:00.000Z	tilt	decora	yes
