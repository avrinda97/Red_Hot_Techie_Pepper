2008-11-21T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	try now
2008-11-21T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	look at what eh shortcut launchers are actuall launching
2008-11-21T20:56:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	it seems to be ok, right click -> create launcher -> I typed the name, command and associated with an icon, plus I ticked 'run in terminal'
2008-11-21T20:56:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	but when I double click - nothing happens
2008-11-21T20:58:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	brb
2008-11-21T21:12:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	so any idea why my launcher would not launch?
2008-11-26T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	compiz-fusion should have been already installed
2008-11-26T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	hello
2008-11-26T16:35:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	I don't think it was. and I installed normal compiz, not the fusion one
2008-11-26T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	"normal compiz"? ?? there is only one. "Compis-fusion"
2008-11-26T16:37:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	in my synaptic, when I typed compiz to find a package, there was compiz and compiz-fusion-bcop. Well anyway, I've got them both installed, but nothing happens
2008-11-26T16:43:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	is it my graphics drivers that causes the problem?
2008-11-26T16:46:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	no idea, not been reading your problem
2008-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	define "not working"
2008-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wesolek	how did you install compiz when yiou said you'd installed it
2008-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	wesolek	ikonia	I've used synaptic PM to install it, and the installation went fine. However, that's it, I don't know how to run/use it
