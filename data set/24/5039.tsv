2006-12-05T06:42:00.000Z	LordMetroid		oka, I mistakenly added a word to the dictionary which seem to follow me in ubuntu... Anyone know how to delete it?
2006-12-05T06:42:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	which dictionary?
2006-12-05T06:44:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	can you specify what you mean by 'it is present'?
2007-12-10T23:25:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	you should write a script for that purpose
2008-05-27T20:41:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	find . -type f
2008-05-27T20:42:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	do not paste stuff here
2008-05-27T20:43:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	and that is not output from find . -type f
2008-05-27T20:44:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	I thought you meant a command to display only files that are not links
2008-05-27T20:44:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	you can look through the output of ls -l -- if anything starts with 'l' (that's lower case L) it's a link
2008-05-27T20:46:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	yes
2008-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	there are no links listed
2008-05-27T20:49:00.000Z	LordMetroid	soundray	 But many of them files indicates of two or three number of links, why?
2008-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	now I see what you mean
2008-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	I've always ignored that number. It indicates the number of hard links.
2008-05-27T20:54:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	so, what's the problem now?
2008-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	you mustn't think of it as one of them containing the 'real data'. That's only with symbolic links.
2008-05-27T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	they all contain the real data, and the real data will be there until you delete the last link.
2008-05-27T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	they are separate and unique files. They just happen to point to the same data
2008-05-27T20:59:00.000Z	LordMetroid	soundray	Hmm, okay, thank you for the hlpe
2008-07-21T03:10:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	you choose the session at the login window
2008-07-21T03:15:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	it's not supposed to be
2008-07-21T03:21:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	no swearing please
2008-07-21T03:21:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	find out what's hogging your CPU
2008-07-21T03:31:00.000Z	soundray	LordMetroid	find out if something is hogging your CPU. trackerd does that sometimes
