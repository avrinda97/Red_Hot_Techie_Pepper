2005-04-19T09:36:00.000Z	cartman		hmm is the new unstable branch already open?
2005-04-19T09:36:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	yes
2005-04-19T09:37:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	whats the name for sources.list ?
2005-04-19T09:37:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	are you currently on hoary?
2005-04-19T09:37:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	yeah
2005-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	ok if you go into  you /etc/apt/sources.list file you'll see a couple of lines that need to be uncommented out...the comments before that should direct you nicely
2005-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	should be toward the top of the file
2005-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	oh I removed those comments already :D
2005-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	care to share?
2005-04-19T09:38:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	then you should be all set
2005-04-19T09:39:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	I want to use latest development release, hoary is stable now :/
2005-04-19T09:39:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	right. I had the others that were already in that file, and I havent changed those.
2005-04-19T09:39:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	ok
2005-04-19T09:40:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	I did hear that marilat was going hoary...or already has...I cant confirm that though
2005-04-19T09:40:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	ewww that will suck
2005-04-19T09:41:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	no marillat for ubuntu development release :(
2005-04-19T09:41:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	I think all that really means is that things that were running well under warty will be available, but then Im not sure ..I never used marilat
2005-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	frankly Im a bit squeamish using anything but ubuntu sources, for stability's sake basically
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	marillat has politically bad stuff for Ubuntu
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	libavcodec,xvid etc
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	yes so I've heard...same for the debian sources...so I stick with ubuntu sources.
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	I mix fine here
2005-04-19T09:44:00.000Z	kkathman	cartman	Im still reasonably new to Linux, so before I start venturing off, I tend to be a little more conservative in the interest of stability and being dangerous :)
2005-04-19T09:44:00.000Z	cartman	kkathman	yup Ubuntu is right for you then :)
