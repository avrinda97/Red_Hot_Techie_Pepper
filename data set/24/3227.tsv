2008-08-11T16:36:00.000Z	itai-michaelson		anyone knows what to do when grub doesnt respond to any keyboard input and doesnt boot into linux? (its not a dual boot)
2008-08-11T16:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	usb keyboards do that sometime, ps2 will work
2008-08-11T16:39:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	its stuck like that almost 20 minutes]
2008-08-11T16:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	any errors on terminal 8?  (ctrl+alt+f8) (alt+f7  to get back to X)
2008-08-11T16:42:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	it doesnt respond to keyboard
2008-08-11T16:42:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	ahh, yeah, sorry :(
2008-08-11T16:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	is it a usb keyboard? And did it work before?
2008-08-11T16:43:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	it worked till yesterday , its not usb
2008-08-11T16:44:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	that is odd. Is this the first time it has happened?
2008-08-11T16:45:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	yes
2008-08-11T16:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	My clean install of Hardy needed a forced reboot the first time. I'd give that a try
2008-08-11T16:46:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	rebooted several times....its indeed strange. i installee a month ago
2008-08-11T16:46:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	but I thought you just said it was the first time it happened?
2008-08-11T16:47:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	i installed a month ago , it was working till yesterday, today i turn the computer on and its stuck in grub,already 30 minutes, rebooted still stuck
2008-08-11T16:49:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	i'm writing from a different computer (gutsy ftw)
2008-08-11T16:49:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	I'd fsck your drive and reinstall grub
2008-08-11T16:51:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	with a live CD?
2008-08-11T16:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	yep
2008-08-11T16:52:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	sounds like it got corrupted to me (just a hunch though)
2008-08-11T16:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	got this:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=462100
2008-08-11T16:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	via:  grub doesn't respond to keyboard
2008-08-11T16:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	but that is the USB issue I mentioned at the start I guess
2008-08-11T16:56:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	DistroJockey	linux_manju thanks for the help. live CD it is
2008-08-11T16:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	itai-michaelson	you're welcome. Check that drive for errors :)
