2008-01-07T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	you need to set the proper permissions.  Are you familiar with permissions on linux?
2008-01-07T06:50:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Not really
2008-01-07T06:50:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Thank you
2008-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	I am familiar with the different directories though
2008-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	just poke me if you aren't sure what you need to do after reading that
2008-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	chmod doesn't seem to be working
2008-01-07T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	pastebin the command you used and the result
2008-01-07T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	and the result of 'ls -dl /media/disk' (you can paste it here)
2008-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	total 16 drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 16384 2008-01-06 19:43 lost+found
2008-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	it worked then, it has 777 permissions
2008-01-07T07:13:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Hmmmm
2008-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Still won't though
2008-01-07T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	it applies only to /media/disk, not subdirectories that already existed.  What are you trying to do that does not work?
2008-01-07T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	using nautilus? try pressing "reload"
2008-01-07T07:15:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Worked
2008-01-07T07:16:00.000Z	lloyd	jrib	Thanks
2008-01-07T07:16:00.000Z	jrib	lloyd	no problem
