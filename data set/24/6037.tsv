2006-02-22T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	there is no need to repeat your question like that
2006-02-22T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	I know you've been asking for a while, no one probably knows the answer.  Try posting at ubuntuforums.org or searching wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-02-22T14:37:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	do you think it's feasible to have 600 people respond ``I don't know'' to every question?
2006-04-06T05:55:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	very easy, just take a look at the link in your private messages from ubotu
2006-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	you will see that gaim-extendedprefs is available through synaptic
2006-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	(provided you have enabled universe)  do you know how to do that?
2006-04-06T06:06:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	have you enabled universe?
2006-04-06T06:18:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	yes.  Have you enabled universe?
2006-04-06T06:19:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	search for gaim.  A package called ``gaim-extendedprefs'' will appear.  right click on it, install, then press apply at the top
2006-04-06T06:21:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	The repository?
2006-04-06T06:22:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	yes, if you have enabled the universe repository, what I said last should work for you
2006-04-06T06:23:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	Yes, I have that repository. But that package doesn't appear in there.
2006-04-06T06:23:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	can you do this in a terminal 'gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and copy and paste the contents to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ , then give me a url?
2006-04-06T06:25:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11190
2006-04-06T06:25:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	you are using dapper
2006-04-06T06:26:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	So can you give me the extra repositories from 5.10 to add in it?
2006-04-06T06:27:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	well gaim-extendedprefs is in dapper universe too.  you must just not be seeing it.  Why don't you try 'sudo aptitude install gaim-extendedprefs' in the terminal
2006-04-06T06:28:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	please close synaptic before running that command by the way
2006-04-06T06:28:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	It couldn't find an application with that name.
2006-04-06T06:30:00.000Z	Yorak	_jason	I can't find alot with sudo apt-search either, am I missing repositories?
2006-04-06T06:31:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	you have all the communities ones except multiverse.  the gaim package you want though should be in there.  Can you do 'sudo aptitude update' and then try again.  If it fails again, can you pastebin the command along with the output?
2006-04-06T06:38:00.000Z	_jason	Yorak	did it work this time?  I am about to go
