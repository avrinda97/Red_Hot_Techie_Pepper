2005-11-18T11:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	do a google search for firefox tweaks
2005-11-18T11:41:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	did you take out the default firefox and install a new one?
2005-11-18T11:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	there are tweaks to make it run faster

2005-11-18T11:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	do a search for firefox tweaks
2005-11-18T11:43:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	I'm talking about Ubuntu being slow in general - I have 256mb on a P-III 850 HP Laptop
2005-11-18T11:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	that is between you and ubuntu and your pc you asked about firefox
2005-11-18T12:19:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	haven't had any problems with it on my Windows machine
2005-11-18T12:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	to everyones disbelief windows and linux are not alike
2005-11-18T12:20:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	you mean that firefox installations on Windows and Linux are not alike don't you? No point in being sarcastic
2005-11-18T12:24:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	I don't want to compare Windows with linux but if Firefox supports both Windows and Linux then I would expect 1.5 to be stable on both
2005-11-30T12:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	thats why they have xubuntu :)
2005-11-30T12:19:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	xubuntu? where did that come from?

2005-11-30T12:36:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	how do I format an ext3 partition?
2005-11-30T12:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	you can use the installer that is on the cd or you can use fdisk or a few others and manully format it. if you  are gonna put and os on that drive use the partioner that the os uses its easy
2005-11-30T12:39:00.000Z	kapputu	gnomefreak	no I'm retiring an earlier installation and I need to format it
2005-11-30T12:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kapputu	 your not putting an os on that pc at all?
