2005-07-25T16:22:00.000Z	supernix		I thought we just got finished saying there was no viruses for Linux so why have clamav ?
2005-07-25T16:22:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	for the sake of friends running windows, you wouldn't want to accidentally forward them a virus. and ^^what he said
2005-08-02T07:11:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	they work for me :)
2005-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	it's a learning filter, you have to tell it what is junk to start with
2009-05-13T04:31:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	are you using the -p switch?
2009-05-13T04:31:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	and the password you set in debconf when you installed?
2009-05-13T04:32:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server
2009-05-13T04:38:00.000Z	supernix	funkyHat	I have done the dpkg reconfigure via terminal and even did a reinstall via Synaptic either way I get no option to reset the password
2009-05-13T04:39:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	try a purge
2009-05-13T04:42:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	sudo aptitude purge mysql-server mysql-server-*version*
2009-05-13T04:45:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	after the purge check that /var/lib/mysql is empty
2009-05-13T04:45:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	then reinstall
2009-05-13T04:46:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	there are ways of resetting the password without reinstalling, but as you've not used it yet this is easier
2009-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	empty it
2009-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	actually delete it entirely
2009-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	no
2009-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	rm -r /var/lib/mysql
2009-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	rm commands with *s in them aren't sensible
2009-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	yep
2009-05-13T04:54:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	:)
2009-05-13T04:59:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	there are a few. phpmyadmin is one, or mysql-admin
2009-05-13T05:00:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	phpmyadmin is wab-based, mysql-admin is a regular program
2009-05-13T05:00:00.000Z	supernix	funkyHat	that notification went off and scared me to death
2009-05-13T05:00:00.000Z	funkyHat	supernix	hehe
