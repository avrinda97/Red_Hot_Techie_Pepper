2011-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	Usually, I use ls /path/to/file_name to make sure its what I want before running any commands to change the file
2011-11-28T14:03:00.000Z	harsh343	soreau	ok thats really Good
2011-11-28T14:11:00.000Z	harsh343	soreau	I want to copy a folder from my sytem to remote server I know cp -r command is used for that but hows from my local system to remote server
2011-11-28T14:11:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	scp
2011-11-28T14:12:00.000Z	harsh343	soreau	why scp ?
2011-11-28T14:13:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	Because you want to copy a file to another machine, presumably over a network
2011-11-28T14:13:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	no, that isnt specifying the destination target
2011-11-28T14:14:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	For example, scp /path/to/file_name user@192.168.1.105:/path/to/destination/folder/
2011-11-28T14:20:00.000Z	harsh343	soreau	but it also takes alots of time to copy
2011-11-28T14:21:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	Is that a random comment or are you making some statement leading to a point?
2011-11-28T14:23:00.000Z	soreau	harsh343	It takes time to do anything which is the very basis of how the world works
2011-11-28T14:23:00.000Z	harsh343	soreau	ok
