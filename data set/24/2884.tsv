2008-08-10T16:04:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	ok
2008-08-10T16:06:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	yes it's a laptop. but the f2 key doesn't have any function for wireless. i have a seperate switch for wireless radio on the side
2008-08-10T16:07:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	i would think it's more a problem with the drivers
2008-08-10T16:07:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	the page u sent me asks to use the ipw3945 drivers.
2008-08-10T16:07:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	but i have no clue how to install them.
2008-08-10T16:08:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	i think i would like to revert to ipw3945.
2008-08-10T16:09:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	might involve recompiling the kernel. firmware? ah someone was saying the firmware for the iwl doesn't come installed :(
2008-08-10T16:15:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	ok i missed a whole set of msgs there :)
2008-08-10T16:16:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	so i think i shall revert to ipw3945. but how ?
2008-08-10T17:08:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	weird! i just installed a hardy backport and the damn thing starts working! wonder how reliable a connection it is
2008-08-10T17:09:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	now my wifi light remains on constantly. ;)
2008-08-10T17:09:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	yea laptop Dell Vostro 1400
2008-08-10T17:11:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	yes it just started working. i blacklisted the old iwl3945 and put in the new one and it started working
2008-08-10T17:12:00.000Z	trupheenix	DozedOnLinux	i think ipw3945 should be included because i hear it has better performance in comparison to iwl3945
