2006-07-25T14:21:00.000Z	Ruffles	Phlexonance	before doin' so try opening your firefox and typing about:plugins in the address bar
2006-07-25T14:22:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Ruffles	found 2, difference is one has "ns7-gcc29" in it and the other just "ns7"
2006-07-25T14:22:00.000Z	Ruffles	Phlexonance	use ns7
2006-07-25T14:22:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Ruffles	and its opera ;) but opera:plugins works too, ok thx a lot
2006-07-25T14:23:00.000Z	Ruffles	Phlexonance	ns7-gcc29 is for browsers compiled with gcc29
2006-07-25T14:24:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Ruffles	when I hit the "validate path" button it tells me its incorrect
2006-07-25T14:25:00.000Z	Ruffles	Phlexonance	maybe you're not using the correct plugin
2006-07-25T14:25:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Ruffles	/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.06/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
