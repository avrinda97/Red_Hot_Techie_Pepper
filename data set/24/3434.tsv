2008-01-19T15:35:00.000Z	misslecommander	CK_L	same exact issue
2008-01-19T15:36:00.000Z	misslecommander	CK_L	it was something like gcc-3.3-base and i believe libstdc++5, there was more but too tired to remember
2008-01-19T15:36:00.000Z	misslecommander	CK_L	either way it was a pain to install.
2008-01-19T15:38:00.000Z	misslecommander	CK_L	i think i may have searched repositories, and installed any thing that had libstdc in it.
