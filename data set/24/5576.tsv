2007-05-12T08:35:00.000Z	Weirdbro		Help! I just installed Ubuntu! Neither my Intel Ethernet card or my Broadcom wireless work. How can I compile the drivers I find on the internet?
2007-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	Weirdbro		I know how to compile them, but Ubuntu doesn't come with sources
2007-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	Weirdbro		Intel Pro/100
2007-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	Weirdbro		Yeah
2007-05-12T08:36:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	Yeah it's a laptop?  Which one?
2007-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	Weirdbro		Compaq V6000
2007-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	starkruzr		That was your first mistake ;)
2007-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	starkruzr		OK, hold on
2007-05-12T08:39:00.000Z	Weirdbro	starkruzr	All fixes I can find for wifi require wired internet, which I don't have either
2007-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	It doesn't make any sense to me that it doesn't work, as AFAIK the drivers for both these things are quite mature and should be included in the distribution
2007-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	I'm looking for information about your drivers, wait one
2007-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	Weirdbro	starkruzr	The ethernet is possibly due to a faulty cable
2007-05-12T08:42:00.000Z	Weirdbro	starkruzr	But I obviously can't have a faulty cable for broadcom wifi
2007-05-12T08:43:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	OK, for starters, who told you you had Intel Pro/100 Ethernet on this machine?
2007-05-12T08:44:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	You have NVidia integrated Ethernet.  http://www.linux-noob.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2798
2007-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	There's a forum post there about getting it to work.
2007-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	Weirdbro		starkruzr- My windows device manager told me that
2007-05-12T08:45:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	It apparently lies :p
2007-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	You've got an NVidia chipset there.  Doesn't make any sense that you'd have Intel Ethernet.
2007-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	starkruzr		(Considering the AMD chip)
2007-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	Weirdbro		It has a big intel sticker on the front of the laptop
2007-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	starkruzr		?!
2007-05-12T08:46:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	Dude, what?  What does it say?
2007-05-12T08:47:00.000Z	starkruzr	Weirdbro	Centrino/
