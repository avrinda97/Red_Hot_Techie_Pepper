2008-08-08T14:03:00.000Z	bony		i am trying to install open ldap server on to a system in a college. I read the entire help page that is there in help.ubuntu.com regarding ldap.  the problem is that i installed the packages that are required to start ldap server and also configured the client in order to connect to the server and get the username  but when i try to do so i get and error say "can not connect to the server" were as when i nmap the server with its ip i could see the port is open
2008-08-08T14:03:00.000Z	bony		can some one help me out?
2008-08-08T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	ok - so you know the port is open and listening - thats great.
2008-08-08T14:04:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	yeah
2008-08-08T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	so the problem is either credentials/schema or authentication
2008-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	well i have a doubt regarding dns name. is it required to have the ip to be binded with a name? can't i configure ldap with out worrying of name?
2008-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	depends how you refernce it, if you reference it via host/domain name, then yes, dns is needed %100
2008-08-08T14:06:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	well i don
2008-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	ok, if you reference it via ip - you should be fine without dns
2008-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	't want the client to refer the server with a host name
2008-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	then you need dns or some form of name resolution
2008-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	well but how to configure ldap in order to skip domain name?
2008-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	you can't
2008-08-08T14:08:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	you'd have to use ip
2008-08-08T14:08:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	yes i wan't to use only ip and not any hostname associated with the ip.
2008-08-08T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	ok - so configure that
2008-08-08T14:13:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	but i am unable to do that can you help me out?
2008-08-08T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	change the hostnames to ip
2008-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	well but how to change this option "DNS domain name: ... debuntu.local"
2008-08-08T14:20:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	check the first section of this web page it says that before installing and configuring ldap the system show have FQDN and other requirements "https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/openldap-server.html"
2008-08-08T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	thats the name of your ldap domain, in the example it will be your hostnames FQD
2008-08-08T14:24:00.000Z	bony	ikonia	so regardless of what name i am giving as the domain name to ldap i can configure it right?
2008-08-08T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	you can configure the ldap domain as bon.my.big.domain.for.fun
2008-08-08T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	bony	most people keep there dns/ldap domains in sync
