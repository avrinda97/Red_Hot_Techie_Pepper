2008-02-01T22:32:00.000Z	white_eagle		ext 2 should not be used?
2008-02-01T22:32:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	white_eagle	imho, the only file system to use is either ext3 or reiser. the journals make things soooo much faster for fsck's
2008-02-01T22:33:00.000Z	white_eagle		and where should I put the root file system??
2008-02-01T22:33:00.000Z	white_eagle		..
2008-02-01T22:33:00.000Z	white_eagle		root = where?
2008-02-01T22:34:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	white_eagle	put root on a partition....I don't understand what u mean by "where"

2008-02-01T22:36:00.000Z	white_eagle		and now, I have one "Linux" partition as ext3 40 gigs, I have an ext3 "root" partition 2150 MB and I have Linux Swap 300 MB, is that ok?

2008-02-01T22:38:00.000Z	white_eagle		ok?
2008-02-01T22:39:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	white_eagle	it this going to be your primary OS?
2008-02-01T22:39:00.000Z	white_eagle	WorkingOnWise	no
2008-02-01T22:41:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	white_eagle	what do u plan on doing with the 40gig partition? if it were my box and I were giving that much space to a secondary OS, I would give root maybe 20, the "Linux" partition 20, and the rest to swap. I know it sounds heavy on swap. but I have actually used over 1gb of swap on here...better safe that sorry.
2008-02-01T22:42:00.000Z	white_eagle	WorkingOnWise	nevermind :)
2008-02-01T22:42:00.000Z	white_eagle		root 20?????
2008-02-01T22:42:00.000Z	white_eagle	WorkingOnWise	why 20 gigs on root?
2008-02-01T22:43:00.000Z	white_eagle	WorkingOnWise	...
2008-02-01T22:43:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	white_eagle	I have 15 used on root..I dont delete anything in the apt cache....and I soooooo hate to run out of space on root. it isnt pretty
