2008-04-05T23:40:00.000Z	soundray	style23	what you call task bar is probably the bottom gnome panel. If you want to see a window list there, right-click it, choose Add to Panel and add the Window List applet
2008-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	style23	soundray	ok I'll take a look
2008-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	soundray	style23	you can install it with a one-liner, 'sudo apt-get install bittornado'. No need to fiddle with .tar.gz files
2008-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	style23	soundray	ok
2008-04-09T05:39:00.000Z	style23	soundray	how do you run it once it is installed
2008-04-09T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	style23	try Alt-F2 bittornado
2008-04-09T05:40:00.000Z	style23	soundray	nope
2008-04-09T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	style23	have you looked in Applications-Internet ?

2008-04-09T05:43:00.000Z	soundray	style23	you need bittornado-gui as well

2008-04-09T05:45:00.000Z	soundray	style23	no, I work on computers and I spent some of my free time here. For the remaining time, I lead a non-digital lifestyle ;)
2008-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	style23	soundray	oh ok. Sound very focus. I need to be in that state of mind
2008-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	style23	when you've got bittornado-gui, there should be a menu entry
2008-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	style23	soundray	I don't know where to get the gui
2008-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	style23	'sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui;
2008-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	style23	'sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui'
