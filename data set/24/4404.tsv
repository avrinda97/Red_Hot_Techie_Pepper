2007-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	hordur		i updated from 6.06 (with working internet) to v6.10 and lost my network. i disabled ipv6 successfully, but still no internet. what should i do?
2007-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	hordur		im using direct ethernet connection, dhcp. i checked dns, but im not eeven getting a ip address..
2007-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	delire	hordur	are you on a RealTek?
2007-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	delire	hordur	i don't know. can you paste your ifconfig output?
2007-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	hordur	delire	i can get you specific info, but i cannot paste anything since the computer is not reachable over network.
2007-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	delire	hordur	i understand.. one moment
2007-04-21T08:35:00.000Z	delire	hordur	what was the fix?
2007-04-21T08:35:00.000Z	hordur	delire	still no internet.. :(
2007-04-21T08:36:00.000Z	delire	hordur	odd. was it working previously?
2007-04-21T08:36:00.000Z	hordur	delire	ya, without a hitch in 6.06
2007-04-21T08:39:00.000Z	delire	hordur	'sudo route -n' what is 'UG' listed next to?
2007-04-21T08:44:00.000Z	hordur	delire	UG is listed on the second line, eth0 but it looks very much the same as the first line where it only says U. what info do you want?
2007-04-21T08:44:00.000Z	delire	hordur	UG stands for "use gateway". if you see your gateway listed there, then you're a step closer.
2007-04-21T08:46:00.000Z	hordur	delire	i have a gateway address on that line. is that what you mean?
2007-04-21T08:46:00.000Z	delire	hordur	if you have a gateway then can you ping it? is the gateway the correct one?
2007-04-21T08:47:00.000Z	hordur	delire	my isp appearantly has a bunch so its always changing.. will try ping now :)
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	hordur	delire	yes, ping does respond :D
2007-04-21T08:48:00.000Z	delire	hordur	wow.. odd. so you do have an IP on that device?
2007-04-21T08:50:00.000Z	hordur	delire	I have 2 lines with different info, but both for eth0. one has destination and genmask ips,  the other has router ip.
2007-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	delire	hordur	i just ssh'd into your machine and fiddled around. just kidding ;)
2007-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	delire	hordur	no idea. i think your router is having a fit..
2007-04-21T08:51:00.000Z	delire	hordur	cool ;)
2007-04-21T08:52:00.000Z	hordur	delire	and fiery_cleric thank you guys VERY MUCH for your help and patience :D (very very VERY much :D :D )
2007-04-21T08:52:00.000Z	delire	hordur	 a pleasure.
