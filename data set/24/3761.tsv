2007-12-07T03:08:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		Can anybody give me a hand with a wireless problem I'm having?
2007-12-07T03:10:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		I'm on a laptop with wireless. Ubuntu automatically used a driver that I know works, but I can't see any wireless networks. I know at least 4 people with the same exact laptop (they are handed out by my uni) and they see them just fine with the same driver and everything. Any ideas?
2007-12-07T03:11:00.000Z	melkor	luciddr34m3r	what do you get if you type iwconfig?
2007-12-07T03:11:00.000Z	melkor		...does it recognize your device?
2007-12-07T03:12:00.000Z	melkor		caravel do you have a dell?
2007-12-07T03:12:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		i have ath0 and wifi0, wifi0 has no wireless extensions, but ath0 does, but when i do a scan for networks it says none are found
2007-12-07T03:12:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		it also lists eth0 and lo, with no extensions of course
2007-12-07T03:12:00.000Z	melkor		How do you scan did you try sudo iwscan ath0 list
2007-12-07T03:12:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		yeah
2007-12-07T03:13:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		and my utility doesnt list any
2007-12-07T03:13:00.000Z	melkor		Are you using the mad-wifi drivers?
2007-12-07T03:13:00.000Z	melkor		lucid
2007-12-07T03:14:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		no, but i know my driver works. same one works on other laptops exactly like mine. i checked. one strange thing is that i can't ifdown and ifup on ath0. it says its not configured...
2007-12-07T03:15:00.000Z	melkor		luciddr3am3r it sounds like your driver is not properly installed, did you use a modprob ...?
2007-12-07T03:15:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		didnt do modprob
2007-12-07T03:16:00.000Z	melkor		How did you install the drivers.  When I used the mad wifi drivers I had to do modprob "???" at the end
2007-12-07T03:16:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		the drivers were automatic
2007-12-07T03:16:00.000Z	melkor		I also have an atheros wireless card.
2007-12-07T03:16:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r	ubuntu	loaded them on install
2007-12-07T03:16:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		just like my roomates with the same laptop
2007-12-07T03:17:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		i even compared to make sure we were running the same driver
2007-12-07T03:17:00.000Z	melkor		Well you got me there then, I think the drivers are included with ubuntu, but when I did it on my old laptop (with the atheros card) they weren't so I install mad wifi manually
2007-12-07T03:18:00.000Z	luciddr34m3r		someone had me edit a few lines of my /etc/network/interfaces file. would anything there contribute?
2007-12-07T03:19:00.000Z	melkor	luciddr34m3r	what does it say.  Mine has two lines it it that aren't commented out.
