2006-10-31T15:43:00.000Z	ndowens		is there a place to see all the packages that come with ubbuntu 6.10
2006-10-31T15:45:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	check packages.ubuntu.com
2006-10-31T15:46:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	will it tell the packages that come on 6.10 iso/cd
2006-10-31T15:48:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	I'm not sure, but I think the package labels will tell you - if it doesn't say universe or multiverse, it's probably on the CD
2006-10-31T15:48:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	ty
2006-10-31T15:53:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	reson i need to know is b/c i have to use ppp b/c i have internet through my pc from phone, so i figure i should be able to cp the configs and put them in ubuntu if the ppp is installed by default, do u know if pppconfigs go in /etc/ppp like other distros
2006-10-31T15:55:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	I can't say, but my understanding is that ppp is not installed by default (a lot of people have complained about this in previous releases)
2006-10-31T15:55:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	well according to that page, kppp isn't in universe or the other one, so if it comes with kppp then it has to have ppp installed
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	could be - I've just heard of people installing and not being able to dial
2006-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	well atm i am on gentoo and it is working from the config i have setup
2006-10-31T16:05:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	if it has ppp base installed then i should be able to just put the config there and i am done
2006-10-31T16:07:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	ppp (2.4.4rel-1ubuntu1) doesn't have universe/multiverse beside it
2006-10-31T16:08:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	so logically I think you're right - I've just been looking through the forums to see if anyone has reported problems but haven't found anything. So I think you should be good.
2006-10-31T16:10:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	i wish to help out by packaging programs, do u know of a easy way to
2006-10-31T16:12:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	I'd check under http://www.ubuntu.com/community and see if you can find anything there

2006-10-31T16:16:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	that's one of the reasons I like the ubuntu community
2006-10-31T16:18:00.000Z	ndowens	ndlovu_	i used ubuntu, hoary but i hear ppl talk about edgy
2006-10-31T16:20:00.000Z	ndlovu_	ndowens	there have been three ubuntu versions released since hoary - edgy is the latest was released last week (check the links in /topic)
