2009-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	Hilikus		so you have both in tandem
2009-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	Refering to us =o?
2009-07-12T04:10:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	Right click, and choose HIDE?
2009-07-12T04:11:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	i don't see that option
2009-07-12T04:12:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	do you want it to automount? or...
2009-07-12T04:12:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	in my laptop i have a recovery partition that i don't want to list there
2009-07-12T04:13:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	if it automounted to say /recovery it wouldn't be listed. Would that be acceptable?
2009-07-12T04:14:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	it's not even mounted unless i double click it, but i don't want to have that option there
2009-07-12T04:14:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	I know... =P Do you care if it was to be mounted automcatically?
2009-07-12T04:14:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	no, i want the UI to be completly unaware of that partition
2009-07-12T04:15:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	if i mount it it's going to be mounted somewhere. mnt, media, etc
2009-07-12T04:18:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	What partition is it, and what file system? Ill post in a sec what to do.
2009-07-12T04:19:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	it's fat32
2009-07-12T04:21:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	sudo gedit /etc/fstab add the following line '/dev/sda# /mnt/recovery cfat noauto,users,uid=1000,gid=100,umask=007 0 2'
2009-07-12T04:21:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	why would i need an entry in fstab??
2009-07-12T04:22:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	its the noauto that will do its magic, it will be hidden from nautilus and not mounted due to noauto
2009-07-12T04:22:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	there must be a way to disable it without making it mountable in fstab
2009-07-12T04:48:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	Work for yeah :)?
2009-07-12T04:48:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	no, i don't really want to add an fstab for that. there must be a way to tell it to just ignore it
2009-07-12T04:49:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	there isn't in nautilus. Dolphin has the option to hide. (If you like KDE)
2009-07-12T04:50:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	well nautilus is getting the info that there is a device that can be mounted from somewhere, so maybe not nautilus but a system setting to hide that device as mountable
2009-07-12T04:50:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	If you search google, there is weird changes you can make.
2009-07-12T04:52:00.000Z	Hilikus	coleys	ill try that, thanks a lot man
2009-07-12T04:52:00.000Z	coleys	Hilikus	No problem =)
