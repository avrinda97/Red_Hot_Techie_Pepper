2007-05-11T07:32:00.000Z	sipior	MerlinZShell	i'd say that's a safe assumption :) you could try restoring those and upgrade again

2007-05-11T07:33:00.000Z	sipior	MerlinZShell	just different versions of feisty, with different foci
2007-05-11T07:34:00.000Z	MerlinZShell		ok now if i want to move to fiesty will it get me back to ubuntu ? or will it stay as edubuntu
2007-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	MerlinZShell		ok now if i set the right repositories for fiesty ubuntu ill end up with right that true?
2007-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	sipior	MerlinZShell	well, technically you're still running ubuntu, you just grabbed some bad repositories. fixing that should restore things
