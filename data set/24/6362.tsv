2006-01-11T12:32:00.000Z	jenda		I need help with segfaulting apps - many of them, and reinstalling the base system didn't help
2006-01-11T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	You may have broken memory
2006-01-11T12:33:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	hmm... how would I know that?
2006-01-11T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	You need to run memtest
2006-01-11T12:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	it is available from apt
2006-01-11T12:35:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	no installation candidate...
2006-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	it seems it should be in the grub meni.
2006-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	ah, got it...
2006-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	you need to reboot to start it.
2006-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	run it for a few passes
2006-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	it'll take a long time
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	You have broken hardware.
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	did you get memtest running?
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	Doubtful..
2006-01-11T13:14:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	hmm... don't think so. I think my segfault problems are, in fact caused by GL
2006-01-11T13:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	are only X programs segfaulting?
2006-01-11T13:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	hmm.
2006-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	well now I can't start X - problem no. 1 :), but yes, and only some (xmms, mplayer, neverball...)
2006-01-11T13:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	and reverting the drivers doesn't help?
2006-01-11T13:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	or using the free 2d-only drivers?
2006-01-11T14:50:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	The whole thing WAS caused by the 686 kernel :))
2006-01-11T14:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	hoh
2006-01-11T14:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	jenda	weird
2006-01-11T14:51:00.000Z	jenda	Chousuke	you're tellin me... weird indeed
