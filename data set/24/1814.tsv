2009-11-05T04:19:00.000Z	elhoir		hi all, i have a problem now with Ubuntu 9.04 in my lappy... fan is always working at full speed!! it didnt in 8.10... what is going on?
2009-11-05T04:19:00.000Z	elhoir		any idea?
2009-11-05T04:19:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	look at your processes
2009-11-05T04:20:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	i have the BOINC software running, but i had it in 8.10 and fan was silent
2009-11-05T04:21:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	use "top", "ps" and any app along those lanes and find the culprit process
2009-11-05T04:24:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	is this normal?http://img689.imageshack.us/i/pantallazoelhoirelhoirl.png/
2009-11-05T04:26:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	URL gave me a 404 error
2009-11-05T04:26:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	works for me :S
2009-11-05T04:27:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	http://img689.imageshack.us/i/pantallazoelhoirelhoirl.png/ ?
2009-11-05T04:27:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	yup
2009-11-05T04:28:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	Ok it did
2009-11-05T04:29:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	cant tell you the real culprit here, but you need to turn many things off
2009-11-05T04:29:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	and turn them on one by one noting the fan speed
2009-11-05T04:30:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	for example you can start up and disable compiz
2009-11-05T04:30:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	ok , disabling compiz now
2009-11-05T04:31:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	i disabled desktop effects (thats a way for disabling compiz?) and no results
2009-11-05T04:33:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	stop "boinc" and "firefox"
2009-11-05T04:33:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	yep, i was going to stop boinc ... but, if thats the problem, why it wasnt in 8.10 ?
2009-11-05T04:34:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	well, Ive no idea
2009-11-05T04:34:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	aaaand, yes, suspending BOINC has slowed down fan
2009-11-05T04:35:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	NOW, why it didnt make sense in 8.10?
2009-11-05T04:36:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	it's different systems and things shouldve been changed
2009-11-05T04:36:00.000Z	Mka	elhoir	you cannot expect everything to be the same
2009-11-05T04:38:00.000Z	elhoir	Mka	thanks so much anyway
