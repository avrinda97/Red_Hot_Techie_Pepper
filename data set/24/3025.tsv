2008-05-20T09:07:00.000Z	redwhitewald1		and what key format is better: hexdecimal or ascii?
2008-05-20T09:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	redwhitewald1	that part doesn't really matter except to router, tkip ans ascii are fine
2008-05-20T09:10:00.000Z	redwhitewald1	SeaPhor	what part doesn't matter? pre-shared key?
