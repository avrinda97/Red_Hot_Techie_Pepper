2008-10-13T12:45:00.000Z	LuYu		well, its not the X server then
2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	LuYu		its 1200x900 like its supposed to be
2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	LuYu		now, the question is, why are 16pt fonts suddenly huge
2008-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	LuYu		and where did my panel go?
2008-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	LuYu		its cool

2008-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	LuYu		which is good
2008-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	LuYu		but now i have to figure out how to make the window manager and XFCE play friendly
2008-10-13T12:47:00.000Z	LuYu		obviously, the new xserver has changed things
2008-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	LuYu		hmmm
2008-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	airtonix	LuYu	btw...
2008-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	airtonix	LuYu	xwininfo -root | grep Width
2008-10-13T12:43:00.000Z	airtonix	LuYu	or just plain : xwininfo -root
2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	airtonix	LuYu	you could try this : xwininfo -root | grep Width -A1
2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	airtonix	LuYu	the -A1 means include the next number of lines also so -A1 means include the next one line found at the match
