2006-11-04T10:12:00.000Z	Lone		I just ran 'lspci -v' and it came back telling me my sound card was "Creative Labs Unknown device 0005"... where else can I find what sound card I have?
2006-11-04T10:12:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Are you looking for the sound driver you want to use? If so, it's likely emu10k1.. Otherwise look at your hardware vendor, or look at the card itself
2006-11-04T10:13:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Oh... just remembered I have a Sound Blaster X-Fi... but http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=vendor-Creative_Labs#matrix says X-Fi doesn't have support yet.
2006-11-04T10:14:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Is there any way at all to get sound?
2006-11-04T10:14:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Well, keep an eye on the new releases of ALSA.. That's unfortunate.
2006-11-04T10:14:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Maybe OSS has support
2006-11-04T10:14:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	OSS...? You lost me there.
2006-11-04T10:15:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Open Sound System
2006-11-04T10:15:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Where would I get to their database?
2006-11-04T10:15:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	It's probably not as great as ALSA, but you'd get sound in most applications with OSS and ALSA emulation.
2006-11-04T10:16:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Sorry, no idea.. Google it. I'd hate to say it but you sound pretty boned
2006-11-04T10:16:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Yeah... this sucks.
2006-11-04T10:16:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	I'll look around and see if I can find anything
2006-11-04T10:17:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	It looks like ALSA is working on a driver for it
2006-11-04T10:17:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Yeah, Creative Labs just updated the architecture for it, so I think it may be a while.
2006-11-04T10:18:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	If you really want to use Linux, do what I did; buy a cheap $30 Audigy 2.. Works great.
2006-11-04T10:20:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Meh, then I'd have to switch out every time I booted up with Vista.
2006-11-04T10:20:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Just leave the Audigy 2 in there, there's not a huge difference between the performance -- they both support hardware mixing, one has slightly better quality that is likely not to be even supported in most games
2006-11-04T10:21:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	The only real performance decrease would be if you but a non-hardware mixing sound card, in which Window's audio would have to waste CPU cycles on using it's software mixer :)
2006-11-04T10:21:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Alright, I'll check it out.
2006-11-04T10:22:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	Alright, just look on the ALSA database for supported Audigy 2 models
2006-11-04T10:22:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	There are some Audigy 2's that don't have hardware mixing, which is lame.. so make sure it's a hardware mixing supported model :)
2006-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	Lone	Phenax	Sweet, props for the help man.
2006-11-04T10:23:00.000Z	Phenax	Lone	And the name of the driver for the X-Fi is CA20k1, when the driver named ca20k1 comes out you'll have support ;)
