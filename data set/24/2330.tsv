2009-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	ftab		how can I find a string in directories ?
2009-07-05T10:52:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	 cd to the directory.  fgrep "stringineed" *
2009-07-05T10:53:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	man fgrep will show you the other switches for the command.  Good luck!
2009-07-05T10:55:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	what did you get back?
2009-07-05T10:56:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	nothing
2009-07-05T10:56:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	ok what that * is for in the string,?
2009-07-05T10:57:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	 look at every file in the directory
2009-07-05T10:58:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	go ahead and break out of it.
2009-07-05T10:58:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	what the grep does then?
2009-07-05T11:01:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	here's an example of me grepping for "header" in a directory   http://pastebin.com/m4a0ee532
2009-07-05T11:04:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	it seems like it's taking for ever :(
2009-07-05T11:04:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	do you have a lot of large files in the directory?
2009-07-05T11:06:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	could you descripe your search in a sentence?   Like : I want to find the string "lassie" in /home/movies/aboutdogs
2009-07-05T11:08:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	is /home/aftab/public_html/joomla your current working directory?
2009-07-05T11:09:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	I would run fgrep (file grep)
2009-07-05T11:09:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	fgrep "PHPSHOP_CHECKOUT_CUSTOMER_NOTE" *.*
2009-07-05T11:10:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	fgrep "PHPSHOP_CHECKOUT_CUSTOMER_NOTE" *.* returned nothing :)
2009-07-05T11:12:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	try a shorter piece of the string
2009-07-05T11:14:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	to make sure you have the syntax corrcet, run it on the file that you know has the string.
2009-07-05T11:15:00.000Z	ftab	dthacker	it worked that way :)
2009-07-05T11:16:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	Good! now we know syntax is correct. Do all the files have the same extension?
2009-07-05T11:17:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	 fgrep "mystring" *.php
2009-07-05T11:18:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	It will not search subdirectories unless you use the proper flag.  See the man page
2009-07-05T11:23:00.000Z	dthacker	ftab	your welcome.  Thank you for your patience
