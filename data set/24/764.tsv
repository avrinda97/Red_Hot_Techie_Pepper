2011-02-19T19:28:00.000Z	blkdg		dude read those links.
2011-02-19T19:30:00.000Z	blkdg		open a term BuMpIc , type locate blaster
2011-02-19T19:31:00.000Z	blkdg		you might have to run updatedb first. be patient, then try locate blaster
2011-02-19T19:32:00.000Z	blkdg		hello, i am using ubuntu 10.4. 32 bit, and it is completely patched.  It has a SIS integrated video card.  I have turned the screen saver off. When I Suspend the machine, the monitor turns Off.  How can I get it to function after the Suspend ends?
2011-02-19T19:33:00.000Z	blkdg		weird, usually there's an os licence, and a few readme's
2011-02-19T19:33:00.000Z	blkdg		no. billmania does it have a card in it?
2011-02-19T19:34:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	An SD memory card?
2011-02-19T19:34:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	if it does, mount the card like a drive on your laptopm then cut and paste
2011-02-19T19:34:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	yep
2011-02-19T19:34:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	The camera has a USB interface.
2011-02-19T19:35:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	cool. does ubuntu see the device mounted when you plug it in?
2011-02-19T19:35:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	No. That's the problem. ubuntu doesn't automatically mount the file system from the Samsung.
2011-02-19T19:36:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	I see lots of entries in /var/log/messages and it seems to be trying to mount it as /dev/sdb1, but it just keeps looping.
2011-02-19T19:36:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	i discovered that a $12 dollar 64 in 1 card reader from tigerdirect is way faster than trying to move the mountain.
2011-02-19T19:37:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	Yeah, that may be what we have to do.
2011-02-19T19:37:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	it's way faster
2011-02-19T19:38:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	plus, read this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/363329
2011-02-19T19:38:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	looks like it's an access issue
2011-02-19T19:38:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	Yup, that's my problem.
2011-02-19T19:40:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	get a cardreader. get a super cheep 64 in 1 one like http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5254915&CatId=942
2011-02-19T19:40:00.000Z	blkdg	billmania	thats in CDN though.
2011-02-19T19:40:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	Looking now.
2011-02-19T19:44:00.000Z	billmania	blkdg	Off to TigerDirect Chicago. Thanks.
