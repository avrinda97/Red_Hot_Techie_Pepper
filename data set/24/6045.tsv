2006-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	AntMaz		Hey anyone know how to install yahoo messenger i know gaim has it i tried following some directions i found but they didnt work (the version for debain
2006-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	are you trying to log in to the yahoo messenger network with GAIM?
2006-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	there is a newer version of GAIM, but I wouldn't know how to install that other than downloading and compiling from source. You'd have to remove the old version of GAIM first though
2006-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	you can download the Yahoo Messenger for Unix at the yahoo website, let me get you the URL
2006-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	how did you install the version that you downloaded?
2006-02-24T06:06:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	how did you install though? like specifically
2006-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	have you removed the package yet?
2006-02-24T06:08:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	if you followed the directions the package is on the system, but you will need to open a terminal and type sudo apt-get -f upgrade
2006-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	this will download the remaining packages needed to run the program
2006-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	in the terminal window
2006-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	what does it say or what happens?
2006-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	after you type in sudo apt-get -f upgrade
2006-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	?
2006-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	you see, when you download the .deb file from yahoo, it doesn't come with all the software to run, so after you run sudo dpkg -i ymessenger*.deb, it will not run due to missing dependencies
2006-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	so that why after the dpkg -i, you need to run sudo apt-get -f upgrade
2006-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	like that, it downloads the rest of the stuff it needs
2006-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	yes, from there you can log in and run those commands
2006-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	i'm not sure why your terminal is acting up, but if you search the ubuntuforums.org, i think i remember seeing other people with problems like that
2006-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	AntMaz	tk401	that still isnt working
2006-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	what happened? anything? error messages?
2006-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	go to synaptic and search for it, see if you can find something by the name of libssl (leave out the version number)
2006-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	did it work?
2006-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	tk401	AntMaz	oh ok.
