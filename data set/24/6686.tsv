2006-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	sophtpaw		i have a friend who says he would use Ubuntu but it is not stable enough??
2006-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	sophtpaw		He says it is based on Debian unstable, and that if it was based on, say, at least Debian testing he would use Ubuntu
2006-04-15T06:55:00.000Z	sophtpaw		i'm a noob and haven't got an answer for this veteran linux user and Fedora fan - any ideas or comments?
2006-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	sophtpaw		any ideas or comments?
2006-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	what is your question?
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	i know someone who would use Ubuntu if it was more stable, if it was based on at least Debian testing instead of Debian unstable
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	okay?
2006-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	well, he says it is not stable and he is a Linux veteran/expert and uses Fedora
2006-04-15T06:59:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	ubuntu dapper is.
2006-04-15T07:00:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	because some guy says that ubuntu isn't stable, doesn't mean that it's not stable. it's based on debian unstable. but there's extensive work gone into it to make sure that it is ready for general use. is it as stable as debian stable? certainly not. but it's much more up to date. and if he's refering to dapper, the version currently under heavy development, it is unstable. breezy is quite stable though.
2006-04-15T07:01:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	because i'm a noob i wanna be able to come back to him and eat his hat. I think he just looks down on Ubuntu coz he's clever and i'm not
2006-04-15T07:01:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	send him in here and we'll eat him alive, i guarantee
2006-04-15T07:01:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	thx!
2006-04-15T07:01:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	hahaha
2006-04-15T07:04:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	what do you mean.. what he says about ubuntu not apply equally to fedora?
2006-04-15T07:04:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	also.. check this out
2006-04-15T07:06:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	read what sorsis says above
2006-04-15T07:09:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	also.. consider this. debian covers many, many architectures. i can't list them all. but ubuntu supports just 3 - x86, amd64, and ppc. now, in debian.. if a package doesn't run on one architecture, it often doesn't make the cut. in ubuntu, you have less bases to cover, and you get more packages out. and because you have less architectures to port to, you have more resources to do work on other packages, instead of porting t
2006-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	yes, i agree. I more 'o less understand the benefits and differences between Debian and Ubuntu. I was more getting at the fact he's claiming that becuase Ubuntu is based on Debian unstable instead of 'testing' that he does not want to use Ubuntu and therefore prefers Fedora
2006-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	well, that's a tad ignorant, and fedora is one of the worst distros around. but do what you need to do! :)
2006-04-15T07:15:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	fedora is an extremely general distro. it doesn't really excel at anything, that's why i find it to be kind of useless. some distros focus on customization, ease of use, great community support, tons of packages, building from source, minimalistic.. but fedora doesn't really do anything.
2006-04-15T07:15:00.000Z	sophtpaw	kameron	good. I'll be sure to pass that on : )
2006-04-15T07:16:00.000Z	kameron	sophtpaw	holla
