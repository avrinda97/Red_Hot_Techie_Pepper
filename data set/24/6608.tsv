2005-09-14T08:55:00.000Z	knelix		Hello!
2005-09-14T08:56:00.000Z	knelix		Hey guys. I'm building a new system-- a budget system, AMD. Trying to decide on CPU. Any recommendations?
2005-09-14T08:57:00.000Z	knelix		I'm looking at this page: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Manufactory=&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=517%3A7440&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&PropertyCodeValue=0&description=&MinPrice=&MaxPrice=&SubCategory=343&Submit=Property
2005-09-14T08:58:00.000Z	knelix		Anyone got suggestions as to which CPU would be best suited for Ubunto?
2005-09-14T08:58:00.000Z	knelix		Yes, I know-- Sorry.
2005-09-14T08:58:00.000Z	knelix		Would an AMD Duron 1.6 Applebred 266MHz FSB be enough to run Ubunto smoothly?
2005-09-14T09:00:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	yes it is enough for day-to-day use. no need to worry about that. I run Ubuntu on a 1Ghz smoothly. RAM is more important i would say. and a good video card.
2005-09-14T09:01:00.000Z	knelix		I'm building on pretty tight budget. So, I'm thinking of 512 MB and going with integrated video for now.
2005-09-14T09:02:00.000Z	knelix		Hello. :-)
2005-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	i have 512mb too. the system never touches the swap partition. my integrated graphics (unichrome cle266) works fine in 2d but lacks dri support needed for accelerated 3d. find out which chipset the video uses
2005-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	just be aware of that integrated graphics uses your RAM as video memory.
2005-09-14T09:04:00.000Z	knelix		Right. True. I am thinking of getting this barebones: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16856119002
2005-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	knelix		This is the manufacture's page: http://www.foxconnchannel.com/products_barebone.cfm?pName=TLM454R3M6-C350
2005-09-14T09:06:00.000Z	knelix		As far as chipset it says "SiS 741 Northbridge" and "SiS 964 Southbridge"
2005-09-14T09:07:00.000Z	knelix		But I don't see anything beyond "On-board VGA graphics controller" for graphics.
2005-09-14T09:09:00.000Z	knelix		btw, I heard GNOME 2.12 is out. I guess it will come with the next release of Ubunto-- or will the current one be updated with it?
2005-09-14T09:09:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	xorg seems to support SiS pretty ok. http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/CategoryHardware - here you can check what chipsets have DRI support
2005-09-14T09:10:00.000Z	knelix		Wow.. disorienting disconnects!
2005-09-14T09:10:00.000Z	knelix		Heh. I'm back now.
2005-09-14T09:10:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	xorg seems to support SiS pretty ok. http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/CategoryHardware - here you can check what chipsets have DRI support
2005-09-14T09:11:00.000Z	knelix	Jowi	I'm sorry, could you explain what you just said to me? heh.
2005-09-14T09:13:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	you will have no problem when it comes to display normal graphics. question is if you can get accelerated 3d for Xorg (the window system). DRI = accelerated graphics.
2005-09-14T09:13:00.000Z	knelix		Oh, okay. When would I use 3d, however? The GUI itself is 2D right?
2005-09-14T09:14:00.000Z	Jowi	knelix	yep, thats it. you can always add a "proper" video card later on though :-)
