2012-08-11T01:59:00.000Z	playman		why cant i make my ubuntu start at IP 192.168.1.3 it always starts at 192.168.1.4?
2012-08-11T02:00:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	if it's DHCP then your DHCP server determines your IP
2012-08-11T02:00:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	if you want a static IP, configure it manually.
2012-08-11T02:07:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	ohhhh you probably had your MAC address change
2012-08-11T02:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	why not just make a static IP on the client instead of worrying about the router?
2012-08-11T02:25:00.000Z	playman	arrrghhh	doesent that mean I edit the interfaces file telling it to use .3 instead of .4?
2012-08-11T02:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	i would move it .100+ for DHCP.
2012-08-11T02:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	playman	do you have the exact router make & model?  i might be able to find a walkthru
