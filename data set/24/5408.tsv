2009-03-08T10:27:00.000Z	unperson		Hi.  I want to dual boot with Ubuntu and Windows XP.  How large a partition do I need for Windows XP, characteristically?
2009-03-08T10:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	depends what your going to use XP for
2009-03-08T10:29:00.000Z	unperson	sebsebseb	Clearly, but I'm not looking for an exact figure here, just a ball park.  If I want to run XP, have a couple of games and maybe office installed, what is the ballpark of space required?
2009-03-08T10:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	most of Office 2003 and 2007  runs well under Wine
2009-03-08T10:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	plus Ubuntu can have, Open Office, KOffice,  Abiword :),  and Gnumeric
2009-03-08T10:30:00.000Z	unperson	sebsebseb	My experience is that it's crashes with reasonable regularity.
2009-03-08T10:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	how about running XP in a vm  inside Ubuntu?
2009-03-08T10:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	maybe with a dual boot as well depending on your games
2009-03-08T10:31:00.000Z	unperson	sebsebseb	The others are fine programs (probably my preference) but sometimes you have to jointly edit stuff in MS formats and conversion issues are too much.
2009-03-08T10:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	I see ok
2009-03-08T10:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	well you can have XP inside Ubuntu and do MS Office there
2009-03-08T10:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	or give it another try with the latest wine, get that by adding the repo from http://www.winehq.org
2009-03-08T10:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	and the virtual machine software I would recommend is  Virtualbox, and you need the non OSE,  the binary from their site for USB suppourt  http://www.virtualbox.org
2009-03-08T10:35:00.000Z	unperson	sebsebseb	I had actually been using crossover, which should perform better than even the latest wine, I think.  But in any case, the reason is sort of the combo of games and the ability to run office occasionally.  I've been trying games under crossover, but some seem to run too slow and many aren't supported at all.
2009-03-08T10:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	well how about  Windows on a dual boot for games, but also in a vm for Office?
2009-03-08T10:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	why wubi on  lap top?
2009-03-08T10:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	yep what I just said
2009-03-08T10:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	yep it is
2009-03-08T10:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	Linux has good native games as well.  in fact go to google and put in 42 of the best linux games
2009-03-08T10:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	linuxlinks.com or whatever the site was, did quite a few gaming articles 42 of the best wine games etc
2009-03-08T10:46:00.000Z	unperson	sebsebseb	Thanks.  In this case it's games I have in hand (gifts and much older stuff that isn't supported on wine AFAIK).  But yeah, there are some good Linux games.  I like wesnoth, for example.
2009-03-08T10:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	yeah some good 3D Linux games as well
2009-03-08T10:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unperson	as for wine you can get a lot of stuff working if you configure stuff,  http://www.appdb.winehq.org
