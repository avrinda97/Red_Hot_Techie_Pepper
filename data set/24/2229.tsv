2010-05-10T05:35:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		this is kind of odd. just did 9.10 update and fixed bad splash with startupmanager. now when I alt-ctrl-F1 my display is disabled (monitor goes to powersave) and I can't get it back with alt-ctrl-F7 or any other.

2010-05-10T05:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	if you're messed with framebuffer resolution with Nvidia - this happens to me too, until i remove the customized Plymouth resolution - then i get my VTs back.  Good luck man.
2010-05-10T05:38:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	you had to customize Plymouth res? were you getting low res splash too? After splash fix I got low res mode. I chose to set up again and then restarted X. this issue came next.
2010-05-10T05:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	are you using Nvidia?
2010-05-10T05:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	when my Plymouth resolution is High = no VTs.  Using default 640x480 plymouth resolution - VTs work.
2010-05-10T05:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	yes. and I just ssh'd in and see from dmesg "fb1: nouveaufb frame buffer device" then "registered panic notifier"
2010-05-10T05:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	are you using nouveau or Proprietary nvidia driver?
2010-05-10T05:41:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	and "nouveau 0000:01:00.0: allocated 1680x1050" ok. how did you change it? I want to use proprietary, but autoconfiged after low res mode on reboot
2010-05-10T05:42:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	do I still   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2010-05-10T05:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	it's only Proprietary that give the broken VTs when plymouth set to high resolution.  see my notes on http://sites.google.com/site/alucidfs/how-i-do/plymouth-resolution
2010-05-10T05:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	it's not an xorg issue
2010-05-10T05:43:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	thanks for the link. my dmesg indicates nouveau and still no VTs
2010-05-10T05:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	not sure then.  Good luck man.
2010-05-10T05:48:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	i restarted gdm and now it reboots when I log in....oh man
2010-05-10T05:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	i have NO idea man - best of luck.
2011-04-11T11:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	it might be easier in future to suggest "glxinfo | grep -i direct" which searches both upper and lower case.
2011-04-11T11:41:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	thanks. I forgot the switch
2011-04-11T11:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	oh no! soreau thanks for correcting me!
2011-04-11T11:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	what for? gksudo is a front-end.
2011-04-11T12:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	if you using sudo with GUI apps you can land yourself in trouble - use gksudo instead
2011-04-11T12:07:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	like starting it from a launcher instead of a terminal? those references you sent (to a non ubuntu site) reference articles that are 5 years old, and are not at all applicable to sudo vs gksudo.
2011-04-11T12:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Seven_Six_Two	actually they still are.  If you start nvidia-settings from the menu, it won't right to xorg.conf (no elevated privilege), so you need to start nvidia-settings with gksu -- if you using sudo you can break your system.  which is explained in the !gksu factoid.
2011-04-11T12:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ZykoticK9	sorry, not the site. Just the references from the site. circa 2006. The site itself looks nice
