2011-01-03T02:04:00.000Z	zmitya		hi all
2011-01-03T02:04:00.000Z	zmitya		guys, I want fix IP, but after a while, networkmanager or something else always changes back to dhcp for some reason
2011-01-03T02:05:00.000Z	zmitya		what is the official way to set up fix ip ?
2011-01-03T02:05:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	 you have to edit /etc/network/interfaces filke
2011-01-03T02:06:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	do not remove it, just edit
2011-01-03T02:06:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	I know, thats easy, and I could kill dhcpclient as well, but I don't want, I would like to set up via this networkmanager thing
2011-01-03T02:07:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	I have alreadi set up my fix ip, but after a while it "falls back" to dhcp for some reason
2011-01-03T02:07:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	is it possible to share /etc/network/interfaces file ?
2011-01-03T02:08:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	sure
2011-01-03T02:08:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	http://pastebin.com/Cwn60f8P
2011-01-03T02:09:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	you have to edit this file and add some line , this is the reason.
2011-01-03T02:10:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	well, thats my point... I don't want to edit the file, because that is why this networmanager is exists right ?
2011-01-03T02:10:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	is the a bug in the NM ?
2011-01-03T02:11:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	well, thats funny I think... but anyway, I'll do it, but I would expect that the networkmanager does this for me.. :(
2011-01-03T02:12:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	in this case, why the "fix IP" is in the networkmanager if it wi;; not set it up ?
2011-01-03T02:12:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	thata what I am talking about edit the /etc/network/interface or  do it by networkmanager
2011-01-03T02:13:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	well, I can't do it by networkmanager, I did it, it works fow a few mins, but later on, it will give me a dhcp address again
2011-01-03T02:13:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	basically thats the question, why ?
2011-01-03T02:14:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	follow guntbert
2011-01-03T02:17:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	never seen before that sorry.. ask for other
2011-01-03T02:17:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	never seen what ?
2011-01-03T02:18:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	you are defining a static ip to your et device and after 10 minutes you get dhcp new ip, never seen this before
2011-01-03T02:18:00.000Z	zmitya	|sg	ok, thanks anyway
2011-01-03T02:19:00.000Z	|sg	zmitya	never use kde , sorry :)
