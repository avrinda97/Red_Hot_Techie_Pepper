2007-07-21T14:31:00.000Z	IceLink		Hey there
2007-07-21T14:33:00.000Z	IceLink		might anybody help me? When an application starts in Fullscreen mode, my monitor shows me "Mode not supported" and i have to reboot, i already took a look into the xorg.conf but i don't know which mode might be a problem or so
2007-07-21T14:33:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	it means the resolution is too big or small
2007-07-21T14:34:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	well, in the xorg.conf, there are only normal resolutiopns from 640*480 to 12..*... and they are all supported, i think
2007-07-21T14:34:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	what driver are you using?
2007-07-21T14:35:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	can you do the gui fine on the live cd?
2007-07-21T14:35:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	i'm not on live, i've got ubuntu installed for months but only full screen isn't possible, somehow
2007-07-21T14:36:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	right, but my idea is that if you can get gui on the live cd to work, that means you can copy the X config from the live cd ramdisk over your X config. That usually works in cases like this
2007-07-21T14:37:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	i'm a little bit confused. which gui do you mean? i don'T use just the console, my gnome-desktio and other apps work fine
2007-07-21T14:45:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	well perhaps try renaming your current xconfig and rerunning the config program
2007-07-21T14:38:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	When you boot off the live cd for ubuntu, you are given a gui desktop right? That means that the live cd made a X config that works. Ok so that's good, now you said your current X config doesn't work right? So what you do is in the live cd, mount your hard drive, then go to /etc/X11 to get the X config from the live cd ramdisk, copy that x config over the one on your hd and you should be set
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	essentially we're using to the live cd to autoremake a working x config for you
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	and you know that i've got a gui on my hard-drive ubuntu which i use every day?
2007-07-21T14:40:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	thyen what is the problem?
2007-07-21T14:41:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	FULLSCREEN is a problem. if an app, for example the game 'enigma' is started, the monitor shall show fullscreen but instead, i get the msg from monitor that the mode is not supported
2007-07-21T14:42:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	so you don'T have any idea?
2007-07-21T14:42:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	no I do, I'd like to know your card brand please
2007-07-21T14:43:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	?hat's a card brand?
2007-07-21T14:43:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	I mean like nvidia, ati, etc, which is yours?
2007-07-21T14:44:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	have you installed the ATI linux driver?
2007-07-21T14:45:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	i installed some driver from the site i guess, however, i've got the configuration-program from ati here
2007-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	IceLink	hexstar	i'll give it a try
2007-07-21T14:46:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	ok :)
2007-07-21T15:04:00.000Z	hexstar	IceLink	np :)
