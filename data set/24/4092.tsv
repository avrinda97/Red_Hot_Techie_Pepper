2009-07-27T21:01:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	You missed the subject: I did not ask for the command but for the indicated service.
2009-07-27T21:02:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	you asked what the function of the command is...  That quotation explains what rsync can do
2009-07-27T21:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	No I did not.
2009-07-27T21:03:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	sorry, I misinterpreted "what is the functionality of..." to mean what does it do.
2012-02-09T23:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	is your question "why does it not power off", or "why are some processes still running and the shutdown never completes?"
2012-02-09T23:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	My question focuses more on: ""why are some processes still running and the shutdown never completes?"
2012-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	do you happen to have remote filesystems, such as NFS, mounted?
2012-02-09T23:20:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	I've seen systems refuse to halt due to I/O locks in NFS, but that's been a while
2012-02-09T23:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	There is no NFS installed on this computer. --
2012-02-09T23:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	'~$ mount' does not show any remote filesysrewm
2012-02-09T23:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	'~$ mount' does not show any remote filesystem.
2012-02-09T23:23:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	k.  there should be a sysreq key combo that tells what programs are still running during the shutdown.  Gimme a moment to look them up
2012-02-09T23:25:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	there it is: "T".  ctrl+alt+sysrq+t should list what program is still running, preventing the shutdown.  q.v. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
2012-02-09T23:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	I am using a Thinkpad T61. Ctrl+Alt+SysRq+T responds: "[timestamp] SysRq : Show State" with a _ prompt on the new line. Nothing more. How to proceed?
2012-02-09T23:30:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	you did that combo during the shutdown, or at a tty?
2012-02-09T23:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	at a tty. The same virtual console where I issued  the shutdown command before.
2012-02-09T23:33:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	there's also sysrq+w that should show only blocked processes.  but it sounds like something is not quire right with this.  Once in that state, could you try a forced reboot with "sysrq+reisub"  (that's sysrq+r, then sysrq+e, etc)
2012-02-09T23:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	"sysrq+reisub" restarted my T61 computer.
2012-02-09T23:35:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	ok, so the sysrq key combo is active.  But for some reason, not telling anything about the running tasks.
2012-02-09T23:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	I agree.
2012-02-09T23:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	you can try going through that wiki reference and see if there are any other "tell me something" tasks that might let it go, or the thaw combo?  Maybe something will trigger and make sense of it
2012-02-09T23:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	mbeierl	I woll do but later. I am hurring now for my local computer club.
2012-02-09T23:40:00.000Z	mbeierl	bullgard4	k, good luck
