2008-02-29T12:25:00.000Z	ZXC314		anyway
2008-02-29T12:26:00.000Z	ZXC314		i go to the start or install option once the gui comes up
2008-02-29T12:26:00.000Z	ZXC314		then it pulls up the Ubuntu thing and loading screen
2008-02-29T12:26:00.000Z	ZXC314		anyway after the orange bar goes back and forth for a while and we start loading from left to right
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		it gets about 75% of the way
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		then stops
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		(cd drive stops totally)
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		just sits there
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		any ideas?
2008-02-29T12:27:00.000Z	ZXC314		it's a desktop
2008-02-29T12:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	how much RAM ?
2008-02-29T12:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	i've seen this problem before online, specifically with Dell Dimension.  I think I even had this problem myself installing Ubuntu on one of those
2008-02-29T12:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	i second that, unless someone here knows. there's also the alternate CD
2008-02-29T12:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	it looks from what i'm seeing online that the alternate CD will do it
2008-02-29T12:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	ubotu is a robot.
2008-02-29T12:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	i'd say that unless you get a specific answer here, the alternate CD is a good solution
2008-02-29T12:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	yeah the bot has the answers to certain FAQs and is invoked by keywords. i did !alternate and he told you the message
2008-02-29T12:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	it's also not necessarily a RAM issue.  I have had the same problem with a Dell Dimension, using the Live CD. But the alternate CD should work

2008-02-29T12:38:00.000Z	ZXC314	prince_jammys	thanks I appreciate all the help, what you are doing really is what makes the open source community great
2008-02-29T12:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	you're welcome, and come back and let us know
2008-02-29T12:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	as for the other chat question: #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-02-29T12:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	that deals with general ubuntu-related (but not support related) stuff
2008-02-29T12:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ZXC314	that probably depends on the IRC app you're using.  check the help page for that app or specify which IRC client you use and someone might know
