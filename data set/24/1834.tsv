2009-08-02T05:01:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Hello back
2009-08-02T05:02:00.000Z	trayzz		little noob question, if there's a file in synaptic called filename.dbg it's debug file that i should probably install rite?
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Just leave it till you need it
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	the problem is that i have a lot of graphic bugs with my radeon hd 2600
2009-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Then you might want to d/l the debug file
2009-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Radeon hdd?
2009-08-02T05:05:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	hd 2600
2009-08-02T05:05:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Ahh, hd is part of the card name?
2009-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	it's just minor things, like i see my desktop wallpaper anytime the new gui notification thing shows me someone going on or offline inn pidgin
2009-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	yup
2009-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Hmmm, sure it's not a Pidgin issue?
2009-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	i'm going through loads of feeds but there's barely much i haven't tried yet
2009-08-02T05:07:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	i have it in wine too and some other apps
2009-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	When does it happen in wine?
2009-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	sometimes my screen just fades to black on fullscreen mode watching movies
2009-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	fruity loops clicking on a menu eg
2009-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	It will do that, if you're not clicking, it thinks you're not using
2009-08-02T05:09:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	well yea but it does it opening any menu or right clicking on a string or anything
2009-08-02T05:10:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	i just thought the debug might help fixing it, even though i'm probably too noob to fix it on my own
2009-08-02T05:10:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	Basically it does it whenever a new window iniyiates?
2009-08-02T05:11:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	in wine yes
2009-08-02T05:11:00.000Z	trayzz	Lostinspac_46	otherwise its fine
2009-08-02T05:11:00.000Z	Lostinspac_46	trayzz	message me
