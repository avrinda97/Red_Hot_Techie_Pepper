2006-05-11T13:24:00.000Z	firebird619		Is there a command I can run in Terminal or something else I can do to reset the volume settings? After installing GnomeRadio, tvtime and gradio and GnomeRadio have horrible sound, full of static and very loud. The sound used to be great.
2006-05-11T13:24:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	alsamixer
2006-05-11T13:26:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	ok, I have alsamixer up, do you have any recommendations on where to set each setting? The sound from tvtime and GnomeRadio are terrible now. What would GnomeRadio have changed to make the sound this way?
2006-05-11T13:27:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	I don't know tv
2006-05-11T13:27:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	ok, Thanks
2006-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	no DNS?
2006-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	can you go to web by IP?
2006-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	No
2006-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	can you ping?
2006-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	to test, sudo route -n
2006-07-08T08:42:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	do you have a reasonable route table?
2006-07-08T08:42:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	no, I can't do anything, but yet I know I am connected because when I pick up the phone while connected I hear the handshake. Also, I have the Modem and Network Monitors on the panel and the Network Monitor becomes active, but the Modem Monitor shows Not Connected.
2006-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	stop pppd, try wvdial
2006-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	I can't tried sudo route -n yet because I am on the Internet on another computer right now. I tried wvdial, it always says connected and then it says carrier signal lost.
2006-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	did you try StupidMode with wvdial? it works for many
2006-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	how do I get to StupidMode with wvdial
2006-07-08T08:46:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	in your /etc/wvdial.conf
2006-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	Do you mean entering the phone, user name, password etc. or is there something else I add to that file to get to StupidMode?
2006-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	no, you first try wvdialconf to generate a wvdial.conf, then, you edit it, you can " man wvdial.conf "
2006-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	wvdialconf did not generate one, it couldn't find the modem. I edited wvdial.conf myself and entered the info myself.
2006-07-08T08:49:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	you can make a link to /dev/modem
2006-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	I have already done that, it was part of the steps of installing the modem. It is an Intel 537EP Internal Modem. It worked great on Breezy, no problems at all.
2006-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	dli	firebird619	I remember wvdial seeks /dev/modem
2006-07-08T08:52:00.000Z	firebird619	dli	It didn't find the modem though, but System => Administration => Networking autodetected the modem after I compiled and installed the drivers.
