2007-04-08T07:32:00.000Z	jin_		I can't restart my ffox, I'm still uploading
2007-04-08T07:33:00.000Z	kbrooks		jin_; define "protect tab" please?
2007-04-08T07:33:00.000Z	jin_	kbrooks	lock the address bar for that tab
2007-04-08T07:34:00.000Z	kbrooks	jin_	aha
2007-04-08T07:35:00.000Z	kbrooks	jin_	doesn't work  that way. finding out what tab locking does...
2007-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	kbrooks	jin_	turns out it works, but you have to go to tab mix plus prefs then menus and then  check freeze tab in the tab context menu
2007-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	kbrooks	jin_	why the other two lock/protect tabs are in the tab context menu AND checked by default is a mystry to me
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	jin_	note: when u freeze a tab, u cant close it
