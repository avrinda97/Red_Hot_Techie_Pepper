2005-05-18T09:22:00.000Z	medication		seems i may have been a bit hasty jumping to kubuntu...
2005-05-18T09:22:00.000Z	medication		does anyone have some insight into what i can do to get past the stall at 25% of "Configuring apt..."
2005-05-18T09:22:00.000Z	medication		?
2005-05-18T09:23:00.000Z	medication		again... for anyone interested here's a thread about the issue: http://tinyurl.com/dkt46
2005-05-18T09:24:00.000Z	medication		ahhh
2005-05-18T09:24:00.000Z	medication		don't know... but once it hits the stall the machine is frozen
2005-05-18T09:25:00.000Z	medication		no ability to esc /ctrl-c/alt-f
2005-05-18T09:25:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	not sure what the installer doing at the time its stalled, but u might consider using debootstrap to install ubuntu as a last resort
2005-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	U can use the live cd, run debootstrap and write a minial OS to the hard drive, chroot to it, and download the rest of the OS of the net
2005-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	I've used the Live CD just to make sure that my system was supported
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	but how do i go about mounting my hdd
2005-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	thanks! i'll give that a shot
2005-05-18T09:32:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	hey I read the forum thread... Did u try static IP in the installer?
2005-05-18T09:33:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	no i hadn't tried that yet... at what point would i set the static address?
2005-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	when it configure your LAN card
2005-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	choose expert mode mgith give u more options
2005-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	right right... i've been using the default install method
2005-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	i'll give that the expert mode install a shot and try using a static ip
2005-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	that actually sounds like a potential solution
2005-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	hope it works
2005-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	medication	goofrider	Thanks!
2005-05-21T07:09:00.000Z	goofrider	medication	Totem, vlc
