2008-01-21T10:25:00.000Z	edwin		complete irc newb question, are people just manually typing in names followed by a colon to reply to questions, or is there some faster way to do it?
2008-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	edwin		actually, i'm wanting to say that autocomplete is a systemwide program/feature, cause it works everywhere
2008-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	personally, I like BitchX
2008-01-21T10:38:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	yes.. BitchX.  great in a terminal.
2008-01-21T10:43:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	i have a fresh install, when I installed xchat it dropped the icon in the menu
2008-01-21T10:47:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	xchat-gnome is fine, i just would rather have something else
2008-01-21T10:47:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	something else like?
2008-01-21T10:47:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	BitchX
2008-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	ah, you mentioned that earlier..i'll look into it
2008-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	try it, it's very effective
2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	you must be missing a file
2008-01-21T10:53:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	i think i'm spoiled..i can't use the bitchx command line version
2008-01-21T10:59:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	the commands are the same as xchat
2008-01-21T11:01:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	except that i don't use commands in xchat (i'm mouse spoiled)
2008-01-21T11:01:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	there is also http://www.irchelp.org/
2008-01-21T11:02:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	good point...
2008-01-21T11:04:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	HEH!
2008-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	any reason you aren't using the repos? they too out of date?
2008-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	flannel i could not grab them
2008-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	also, what output are you getting when you try to configure, make, make install?
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	you'll need the dependencies along with the DEV(EL) versions of them in order to compile
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	give me a sec and i might paste it
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	edwin	wyclif	also you'll need the package "build essential" anyways, i'll wait for you to get back
2008-01-21T11:47:00.000Z	wyclif	edwin	thanks i wondered if I was missing a package
