2006-04-05T10:52:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		" mean?
2006-04-05T10:53:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		if I unistnall bash
2006-04-05T10:53:00.000Z	Nickgarvey		would I be able to get it back?
2006-04-05T10:54:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	removing bash would remove dozens of other really important things
2006-04-05T10:55:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	so you already removed bash?
2006-04-05T10:56:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	no.. but it says it is being "held back"
2006-04-05T10:56:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	does it say anything about running 'apt-get -f install' ?
2006-04-05T10:56:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	not yet.
2006-04-05T10:58:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	reason I want it gone is because Ic an't install anything
2006-04-05T10:58:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	can you copy+paste the whole error into a pastebin?
2006-04-05T10:59:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	I get a few different ones depending on the apt-get I run
2006-04-05T10:59:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	so paste them all :-)
2006-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	ok, can you put your sources.list file into a pastebin too?
2006-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	and the output of 'apt-cache show gnomebaker'
2006-04-05T11:05:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	I won't need to reinstall right?
2006-04-05T11:06:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	shouldn't do :-)
2006-04-05T11:06:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	what do you mean?
2006-04-05T11:07:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	shouldn't need to reinstall
2006-04-05T11:07:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	good, I have a lot of things that would be annoying to backup/restore heh
2006-04-05T11:07:00.000Z	Nickgarvey	hyphenated	any idea on whats doing this? its midnight here
2006-04-05T11:07:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	it looks like the package is clashing with another repository (the elive one, last one in your sources.list)
2006-04-05T11:08:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	comment that line out, do an apt-get update, etc
2006-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	hyphenated	Nickgarvey	do you remember what the other repository was added for anyway?
