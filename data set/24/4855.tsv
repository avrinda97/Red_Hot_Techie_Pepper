2008-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	xavier__		sooo, i have an issue
2008-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	xavier__		i'
2008-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	xavier__		i just installed gutsy and i have sound coming from the back of my machine, even when i have headphones plugged in
2008-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	xavier__		is there a way to make it not do that?  or to disable the internal ones?
2008-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	xavier__		anyone?
2008-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	xavier__	Play with volume controls?
2008-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	xavier__	MrObvious	you live up to your name! ;)  But seriously, I couldn't fix it through that :/
2008-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	xavier__	It could be a built in speaker in the case.
2008-01-19T08:12:00.000Z	xavier__	MrObvious	that's what I'm thinking, but I'd like the logical behavior where if headphones are plugged in it doesn't play
2008-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	MrObvious	xavier__	Hmm might not be a fully supported sound chip or something needs configuring. Give me your soundchip and I'll find a link or something.
