2007-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	Gothfunc		in parted, print shows " 4      11.4GB  204GB  193GB  primary  ext3", i enter "resize 4 0 204GB", and it returns "Error: Can't have the end before the start!" - but the end isn't before the start??
2007-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	it's not a resize operation if you're trying to move the beginning of a partition.
2007-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	move says "use resize"
2007-09-19T11:33:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	I'm not sure it's possible to do what you want with parted
2007-09-19T11:33:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	i see.  know any alternatives?  using ubuntu server here
2007-09-19T11:34:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	if I understand you correctly, you have a 204GB partition that is offset from the beginning of the disk by 11GB?
2007-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	actually, i've just discovered that the important data on the partition isn't there at all.... so i guess i just reformat
2007-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	hooray for backups :P
2007-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	that'll be a lot easier anyway.
2007-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	yeah, it involved me losing some work though, but oh well, no choice now
2007-10-03T07:07:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	it's fine
2007-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	when i run irrecord, i get: irrecord: could not get file information for /dev/lirc
2007-10-03T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	you have to configure things correctly in /etc/lirc . It's a bit tricky
2007-10-03T07:09:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	ok sure, i've read the docs and found my remote's config.  i'm trying the hello world lircrc from the faq.  i'm not sure what i'm missing
2007-10-03T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	last time I checked, there wasn't much useful documentation for lirc in ubuntu, but if you look for help with recent Debian versions, the instructions should apply.
2007-10-03T07:10:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	so i tried using irrecord to actually see if my remote is working, and now i'm stuck
2007-10-03T07:10:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	ok, thanks
2007-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	when i run lircd from the command line i get "lircd: can't open or create /var/run/lircd.pid".  does that sound familiar?
2007-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	additionally: "lircd: Permission denied"
2007-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	you haven't got appropriate privileges. If you installed from ubuntu packages, you should use 'sudo invoke-rc.d lirc start' to start the daemon. Or maybe lircd, I'm not sure.
2007-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	silly me
2007-10-03T07:27:00.000Z	soundray	Gothfunc	good luck with lirc, I know it can be a PITA
2007-10-03T07:27:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	heh, thanks :P
2007-10-03T07:28:00.000Z	Gothfunc	soundray	i have irrecord running now, though no input, but at least i've made progress :)
