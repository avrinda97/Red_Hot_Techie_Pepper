2012-05-11T19:18:00.000Z	ZenMaster		My Production serer of 11.10 is running great. Should I upgrade to 12?
2012-05-11T19:20:00.000Z	ZenMaster		No I do not.
2012-05-11T19:20:00.000Z	ZenMaster		And for my call center this server is critical because the call center software stores all the dispositioned leads here.
2012-05-11T19:21:00.000Z	ZenMaster		So when the client wants to make sure the Agent is doing their job, they can connect and download.
2012-05-11T19:21:00.000Z	ZenMaster		I am I.T. for a Telemarketing firm. :)
2012-05-11T19:22:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	is also the master of wisdom.
2012-05-11T19:23:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Yes, that is a good reason.
2012-05-11T19:24:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Hahaha, my employer does not care what I do. He buys toys and gives me an idea of what he wants and then I facilitate that.
2012-05-11T19:25:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	I'm working in an environment where they care selectively. THey care more when a client has a concern of compliance, so I'm left making decisions based on that.
2012-05-11T19:26:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	I hear ya.
2012-05-11T19:30:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	What are you usign Ubuntu workstations for? For instance, the Agents in this office, 60 total, have to use a Java based client to connect to there call center software. So I could see ubuntu being a great workstation. What do your  users do?
2012-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	I'm advocating Ubuntu to cut cost in M$ licensing. Most of my testing is the systems on my desk at this point.
2012-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Ahhh. :D
2012-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	I'm "that guy" in the IT dept. The 15 year linux guy who had to pick a windows sysmin profession.
2012-05-11T19:32:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Yes all the machines here run Xp, with a Win Server 2008 running AD DHCP and DNS.
2012-05-11T19:33:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Same here. :)
2012-05-11T19:34:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	yea we're running the works on the M$ side. And they're impressed with how well my open source alternatives are working out. I'm the only person running linux as my primary workstation.
2012-05-11T19:34:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	That is awesome!
2012-05-11T19:34:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	My only small victory at the moment is our File server I have rocking Ubuntu. ;)
2012-05-11T19:35:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	we had a very mixed environment on the nix side before I came onboard. BSD, Solaris, Debian, Cent & SUSE. Consolidated that. Easier to script.
2012-05-11T19:37:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	Ubuntu has solved lots of problems for me.
2012-05-11T19:37:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Jesus!
2012-05-11T19:38:00.000Z	kinenkaya	ZenMaster	and for the company.
2012-05-11T19:39:00.000Z	ZenMaster	kinenkaya	Well that is an awesome testimony. Should be on the front page.
