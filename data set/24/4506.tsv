2007-07-29T10:10:00.000Z	CommanderCool		help plz! my external ntfs drive cannot be mounted
2007-07-29T10:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	sudo apt-get install ntfs-config && sudo ntfsconfig
2007-07-29T10:11:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	i did that
2007-07-29T10:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	I did o.O
2007-07-29T10:15:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	i bet you didnt
2007-07-29T10:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	Yeah? 5?
2007-07-29T10:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	Did you run through ntfs-config and configure your NTFS partition to be mounted?
2007-07-29T10:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	I thought it was purely an NTFS issue. sudo fdisk -l. Does ubuntu see the drive?
2007-07-29T10:21:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	when i plug it: "Unable to mout the volume[...]  volume is scheduled for check"...
2007-07-29T10:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	Sounds like the journal is unclean.
2007-07-29T10:22:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	how to solve that?
2007-07-29T10:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	Is windows installed on this NTFS partition?
2007-07-29T10:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs && sudo ntfs-fix /dev/yourpartition
2007-07-29T10:25:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	it claims to be successful but it is not
2007-07-29T10:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	You still get the same error when trying ntfs-config ?
2007-07-29T10:27:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	yes, same error (in case you did not get my answer)
2007-07-29T10:33:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	when i try to mount the drive with "force" option, it tells me, that he failed to access mountpoint: no such file or dir
2007-07-29T10:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	Have you created the mountpoint?
2007-07-29T10:34:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	how?
2007-07-29T10:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	sudo mkdir /your/mount/point
2007-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	will that directory be removed when i unmount?
2007-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	CommanderCool	No, it'll just become empty.
2007-07-29T10:38:00.000Z	CommanderCool	Stormx2	all that junk...
