2005-10-20T05:36:00.000Z	cappiz		why is that?
2005-10-20T05:37:00.000Z	topyli	cappiz	devices live under /dev but /dev is not a device. you must specify one
2005-10-20T05:37:00.000Z	cappiz		what do you mean and how do i do that?
2005-10-20T05:37:00.000Z	cappiz	topyli	?
2005-10-20T05:39:00.000Z	topyli	cappiz	sorry, in fact df doesn't need you to define a device
2005-10-20T05:40:00.000Z	cappiz		yeah thats what i thought
2005-10-20T05:40:00.000Z	cappiz		dont understnad why i get that error

2005-10-20T05:41:00.000Z	cappiz		but i get this strange line topyli : none 5.0M 2.8M 2.3M 56% /dev
2005-10-20T05:41:00.000Z	cappiz		unpartition spaced?
2005-10-20T05:43:00.000Z	topyli	cappiz	where do you get that? with mount?
2005-10-20T05:44:00.000Z	cappiz	topyli	i get that line when i do a 'df -h'
2005-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	topyli	cappiz	strange. i don't see anything like that with df
