2006-10-25T16:42:00.000Z	dcordes		anybody uses tranflash card?
2006-10-25T16:43:00.000Z	dcordes		schoaibma: if you ask your question a third time the chance to get an answer will drop below zero
2006-10-25T16:43:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	I do
2006-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	nice you use it with a device in between or do you connect with sd adaptor?
2006-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	adapter travel flash of PQI
2006-10-25T16:45:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	is that a flash card reader? i have the problem that, when i connect the card with my cardreader, i can write files and they also appear on my mobile phone but they're all empty files!
2006-10-25T16:46:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	no it does also writing
2006-10-25T16:48:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	oh yes the term card reader is not quite well selected :-) do you have any idea what could be the problem with my device? as i siad i can write. but only filenames without content. i copy the things nautilus and it is too quick
2006-10-25T16:50:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	to tell you the truth, I don't know, it simply works over here
2006-10-25T16:51:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	truth can be hard :( well i think my samsung cell phone writes some kind of special file system on it which ubuntu can't handle. but thanks for your response
2006-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	this is the case, I can not write to my Sony as well
2006-10-25T16:53:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	you ever tried to write on it with windows?
2006-10-25T16:55:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	it does not work either, just with the software that came with the phone
2006-10-25T16:56:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	for my samsung flash card it works. that's what i can't understand. why should windows handle this filesystem and ubuntu not. i think it is jut a fat32 but there are several configuration files written onto it by the phone.
2006-10-25T16:57:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	try this with the ippd f.ex. ot does write files in win, but it doesn't with my debian, says fat32
2006-10-25T16:59:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	i didn't really get this what is  ippd f.ex. ?
2006-10-25T05:00:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	ipod for example , ok my fault wasn't understandable
2006-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	oh i see i got to look out for a solution then. copying files via samba worked just fine but now i have no more windows boxes here
2006-10-25T05:03:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	it has something to do with DRM in the ipod case... but really I don't know why it is not working in your case
2006-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	yea my case is really strange. i should call samsung mobile support and ask them why the hell my flash memory doesn't work with my linux box :-P
2006-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	dcordes	freebse	the strange thing is that nautilus says the files are written and it also takes its time but they're just empty
2006-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	freebse	dcordes	ya do it, it can be fun, but they son't know either, and fun for 0.49ct or even higher per minute
