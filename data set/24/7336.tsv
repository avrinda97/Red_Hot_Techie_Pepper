2005-08-08T10:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	after a few years, that's what seems to happen with spam
2005-08-08T10:46:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	I've had my email address for years, get about 15 a day
2005-08-08T10:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	I get a lot also (I don't even know how much anymore honestly)
2006-01-18T17:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	I do this daily: sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2006-01-18T17:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	nm
2006-04-13T16:33:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	he wants to do a reinstall
2006-04-13T16:33:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	like you do in XP
2006-04-13T16:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	yes, but what is the reason?
2006-04-13T16:34:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	he's probably just used to XP, probably doesn't have a good reason
2006-04-13T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	(I don't use XP)
2006-04-13T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	why don't you let him speak for himself :-)
2006-04-13T16:34:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	why do you want to go through the install process?
2006-04-13T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	are you on (bad) drugs?
2006-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	ubu should just pick it up
2006-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	but I'll need a different X server, currently I'm running a Matrox G400, I need to switch X servers to a nVidia 6200
2006-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	oh my
2006-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	that's sarcasm?
2006-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	I had no idea
2006-10-19T10:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	no, although I understand your question :-)
2007-03-16T16:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	/lastlog nick
2007-03-16T16:44:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	what?
2007-03-16T16:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	a way to aggregate the statements of a particular nick is, for example: /lastlog levander
2007-03-16T16:45:00.000Z	levander	Xenguy	thanks
2007-03-16T16:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	levander	yw
