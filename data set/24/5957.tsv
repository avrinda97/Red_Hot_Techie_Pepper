2006-03-19T10:48:00.000Z	Grark		Can someone help me reinstall gcc 3 instead of 4...I think that's what's choking vmware
2006-03-19T10:49:00.000Z	Grark		figures it would be that simple.
2006-03-19T10:50:00.000Z	Grark		crap.
2006-03-19T10:50:00.000Z	Grark		that didn't work
2006-03-19T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	try export CC="gcc-3.4"
2006-03-19T10:51:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	what does that do?
2006-03-19T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	I my creaky memory serves, when a config script or make calls for a c compiler, it looks at CC first
2006-03-19T10:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	what that's doing is setting an environment variable, you can see yours with env | sort
2006-03-19T10:56:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	anywhere I can see a "log" for opening apps?
2006-03-19T10:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	you can see a history of your terminal, type history ; I don't think that's what you're looking for, though
2006-03-19T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	does pressing alt-tab show you the apps? (maybe a stupid question, but let's get it out of the way)
2006-03-19T11:00:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	no it doesn't
2006-03-19T11:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	ok. which apps? You have a very vague problem
2006-03-19T11:01:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	two apps specifically that I installed..
2006-03-19T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	vmware, I havent' a clue. Do you have java installed?
2006-03-19T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	does java -version say something about 1.4.2 or 1.5?
2006-03-19T11:03:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	well I reinsatalled v1.4.2 to get azareus working...
2006-03-19T11:04:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	NOW when I go to install vmware again, it's giving me "What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running
2006-03-19T11:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	Like I said, I've no clue about vmware, except you gotta recompile your kernel or modules or some such. Never used it :)
2006-03-19T11:05:00.000Z	Grark	nickrud	strange because I had it working....
2006-03-19T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	and if java is kicking back 1.4, maybe you need 1.5. I don't use java much, and azureus not at all.
2006-03-19T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	your vague question came down to things I don't know :)
2006-03-19T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	a shortcut for that might be just removing azureus's config in your home dir.
2006-03-21T17:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Grark	sudo aptitude install totem-xine ; that'll get you away from gstreamer
