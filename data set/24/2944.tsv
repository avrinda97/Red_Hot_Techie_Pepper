2010-05-16T10:44:00.000Z	Agu10		hello
2010-05-16T10:44:00.000Z	Agu10		I have a question
2010-05-16T10:44:00.000Z	Agu10		what happens if I use the same ubuntu on another computer, with other GPU ?
2010-05-16T10:44:00.000Z	Agu10		can I have 2 different configurations?
2010-05-16T10:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	also 32bit or 64bit? (whichever you have)
2010-05-16T10:45:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	32
2010-05-16T10:46:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	I want to run ubuntu in a gtx260 and also with an intel integrated GPU
2010-05-16T10:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	try it via live cd first to check?
2010-05-16T10:47:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	I have a live usb stick
2010-05-16T10:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	does the other computer allow boot from usb?
2010-05-16T10:47:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	I am trying to run it at home AND also at school
2010-05-16T10:47:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	yes, but I'm talking about the gpu drivers. can I have 2 different configurations? for 2 different gpus ?
2010-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	if there are drivers, sure no problem
2010-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	are you talking about a persistent usb stick?
2010-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	yes
2010-05-16T10:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	well it certainly can run in a lesser graphics mode, but to have the correct 3d drivers you may need another stick
2010-05-16T10:52:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	so I can't use 3d drivers on 2 different gpus ?
2010-05-16T10:52:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	:@
2010-05-16T10:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	I've never tried it, just making a guess--one way to find out though
2010-07-11T10:47:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	why did they move the controls to the left?
2010-07-11T10:47:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	to be more mac-users friendly?
2010-07-11T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	plans for the next release, need to free up the right side for windicators, an applet type thing.
2010-07-11T10:48:00.000Z	Agu10	bazhang	what's that?
2010-07-11T10:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Agu10	mind taking this to #ubuntu-offtopic where I can explain?
