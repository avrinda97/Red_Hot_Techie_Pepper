2005-05-10T14:50:00.000Z	concept10		what does install speed have to do with anything, you only install once
2005-05-10T14:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	another reason why having a non-GUI installer isn't such a bad thing
2005-05-10T14:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	www.ubuntu.com/wiki/RootSudo
2005-07-06T12:59:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	what is NM?
2005-07-06T12:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	NetworkManager
2005-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	in breezy, network-manager
2005-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	has that been ported to debian yet?
2005-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	no idea, don't use debian
2005-07-06T13:02:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	I mean ubuntu
2005-07-06T13:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	it is going to be installed by default in Breezy
2005-07-06T13:04:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	well do you have _news_ if there is a package avail now of NM?
2005-07-06T13:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	I have installed it on my mahcine
2005-07-06T13:05:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	I dont run breezy, the question was basically is it avail for Hoary.
2005-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	ask for a backport
2005-07-31T15:15:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	I was using Fedora because of new packages but Ubuntu has new packages that are stable.  The community is tighter also.  You have to go through loops and chains to contribute to the project.  In ubuntu, you start when you like.  Red Hat engineers still maintain tight grip on the distro (Which is not bad)
2005-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	true, for some unknown reason, my lug installs FC at our install fests
2005-07-31T15:17:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	because everyone wants to be familiar with Red Hat because of thier position in the Enterprise market.  If you want a sysadmin job, you need to know how to admin a Red Hat machine.
2005-07-31T15:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	yes and until then, nothing like Ubuntu exisited. All the "newbie" distros cost money
2005-07-31T15:19:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	I agree.  My last statement on this topic.  Ubuntu has done an excellent job.  Has captured a community in a short time.  I believe this is why that Ubuntu catches flak from the true Debian purists sometimes.
2005-08-06T11:20:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	when in the next meeting
2005-08-06T11:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	20utc, 2 aug
2005-08-06T11:22:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	Thanks.
2005-08-07T14:47:00.000Z	concept10	Burgundavia	Im wondering, if backports are official - when will I be able to search with packages.ubuntu.org
2005-08-07T14:49:00.000Z	Burgundavia	concept10	I suspect that p.u.c has not yet caught up with that stuff
