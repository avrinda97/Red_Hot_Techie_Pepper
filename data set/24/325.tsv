2011-12-08T01:38:00.000Z	diatomaceous		I had so few problems with breezy badger => edgy eft era..
2011-12-08T01:39:00.000Z	diatomaceous		Sorry, I thought talking about issues with ubuntu was exactly what this channel was for
2011-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	diatomaceous		I fail to see how a discussion of problems with ubuntu is off-topic here
2011-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	diatomaceous		can you turn off 'entered' and 'left' messages? that'd help substantially
2011-12-08T01:41:00.000Z	diatomaceous		honest question right there - I'm using pidgin and this channel would be much easier to use if i could turn off 'entered' and 'left' messages
2011-12-08T01:43:00.000Z	diatomaceous		thanks guys

2011-12-08T01:44:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	nice, that works great.
2011-12-08T01:52:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	i have an E350 APU, and the proprietary AMD video drivers render the machine unbootable. and performance is good enough with the Free "radeon" driver that i have not cared enough to look into lkml bug reports.
2011-12-08T01:52:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	Yeah, that's basically been my experience as well.  I just can't believe how I get ~5 hours in windows, and less that 1 hour in linux.  It's unforgivably bad.
2011-12-08T01:53:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	4.5h on a 6-cell here. well within acceptable limits.
2011-12-08T01:53:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	nice, congrats to you for that.  I have 9 cell but the draw is ~74 watts measured by powertop
2011-12-08T01:55:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	what kernel, and what arch?
2011-12-08T01:55:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	  3.0.0-13-generic #22-Ubuntu SMP Wed Nov 2 13:27:26 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2011-12-08T01:57:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	same. weird that your experience is so different. i use XFCE, but that should hardly make *that* kind of difference.
2011-12-08T01:57:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	 It's the same whether I launch unity, unity2d, gnome, or gnome classic
2011-12-08T01:58:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	I'm 90% sure it's the video card, because the machine dumps heat like a blowdryer.
2011-12-08T01:59:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	tried disabling anything GL rendered? no desktop effects and such?
2011-12-08T01:59:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	How would I do that besides trying a login session with ubuntu 2D?
2011-12-08T02:00:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	oh, you said Unity 2D. sorry.
2011-12-08T02:01:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	huh? an AMD APU *and* Intel on-board?
2011-12-08T02:01:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	AMD firepro and intel i7 built-in GPU
2011-12-08T02:02:00.000Z	mneptok	diatomaceous	so not an AMD APU then. i could have sworn you said APU, but i'm undercaffienated.
2011-12-08T02:02:00.000Z	diatomaceous	mneptok	It's ok :)
