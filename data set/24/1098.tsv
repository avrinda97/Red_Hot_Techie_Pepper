2010-07-20T07:51:00.000Z	blitzo		can anyone tell me how to set up wifi from command line?  my network manager has stopped working
2010-07-20T07:52:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	do you have a wlan0 in `sudo ifconfig -a`?
2010-07-20T07:55:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	configuring from the commandline looks something like `sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.0.110` where 192.168.0.110 falls somewhere inside your local network.  But the output of ifconfig -a would help.
2010-07-20T07:57:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	did you have them try the ifconfig command I posted?
2010-07-20T07:59:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	Now that I think of it, wicd might be a way to go ... if you can get them to connect to lan and install it (I use wicd)
2010-07-20T08:00:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	i am doing tech support by telephone - i cannot read the sceen, so tell me what you are looking for
2010-07-20T08:00:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	i prefer wicd but we do not have internet until this works so is catch 22
2010-07-20T08:01:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	I see.
2010-07-20T08:01:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	whae: we all are
2010-07-20T08:04:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	we need the output of iwlist wlan0 scan ... this lists all available wireless netowrks.  We can then connect one but we need the ESSID of the one that you want to connect o.
2010-07-20T08:09:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	what about `sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`?
2010-07-20T08:09:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	... I mean `sudo ifup wlan0
2010-07-20T08:12:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	whae output of ifup is "ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0"
2010-07-20T08:13:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	is the wireless driver installed?
2010-07-20T08:13:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	whae we have installed wubi and it has worked before - just reinstalled should be the same
2010-07-20T08:15:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	too bad.  hope she doesn't give up.
2010-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	whae i am going to post the whole tale on ubuntuforums.org in the beginner section under the title "ubuntu nightmare" please check it out and comment
2010-07-20T08:26:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	whae: I agree, we definately need first hand accounting
2010-07-20T08:30:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	I understand some frustration but linux dists have really come to a point where they are usable by everyone with a little work.  Does she have a computer that is connected to the internet that is near by?
2010-07-20T08:31:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	yes she has a win box on the net - that is how we are doing skype
2010-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	I would suggest having her type everything ... line for line character for charcter ... into something like paste bin so we can "see" her screen
2010-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	we really are working kinda blind here?
2010-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	flyeng4	blitzo	I would suggest that she steels a 6' ethernet cable from work and gets on here tomorrow night.
2010-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	blitzo	flyeng4	network cable not an option right now
