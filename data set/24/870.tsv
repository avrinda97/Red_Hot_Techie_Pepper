2011-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	slim_charles	urgru	what exactly do you need?
2011-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	urgru		hi slim_charles. wlan networks show, i enter the correct password, but it doesn't connect
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	urgru		it works on this machine with a different os
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	urgru		so hardwar should be fine
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	slim_charles	urgru	do you know the network?
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	slim_charles		is it your own network or school?
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	urgru		yes. it's my home network and I am connected on a different machine as well
2011-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	slim_charles		because they use more than just ssid and password
2011-08-13T11:38:00.000Z	slim_charles		ok
