2008-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	keres		for some reason i cannot open files i have downloaded from my desktop
2008-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	keres		it always says they are missing, but they really aren't
2008-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	keres		Jasonosa: i did check them in the shell
2008-12-18T17:55:00.000Z	keres		that's how i figured out they were messing up
2008-12-18T17:56:00.000Z	keres		these files appear on my desktop, but when i try to perform an action with them it always says 'error: file does not exist'
2008-12-18T17:58:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	try deleting them from gksu nautilus
2008-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	gksudo rm ~/Desktop/map-q2wdm3-b2.pak' ?
2008-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	if you want CLI then sudo
2008-12-18T17:59:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	specify full path /home/keres/Desktop...
2008-12-18T18:01:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	http://img210.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotii0.png
2008-12-18T18:03:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	use sudo instead of gksudo
2008-12-18T18:03:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	same result
2008-12-18T18:04:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	tiyowan, I'd say log off and back on
2008-12-18T18:05:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	I initially suggested Alt-F2 "gksu nautilus" then do it via GUI
2008-12-18T18:12:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	should've gone the "gksu nautilus" way as suggested
2008-12-18T18:13:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	gksudo nautilus and search for it?
2008-12-18T18:13:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	i did
2008-12-18T18:13:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	yes, and graphically navigate to it
2008-12-18T18:14:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	i did. nothing happened.
2008-12-18T18:15:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	rm is a very powerful command, you should exercise extreme caution when using it
2008-12-18T18:16:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	right-clicking in nautilus and deleting is the safer way
2008-12-18T18:16:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	i couldn't delete in nautilus. the file did not show up.
2008-12-18T18:17:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	keres	when that happens again you know what to do: log of/on
2008-12-18T18:18:00.000Z	keres	allsystemsarego	i did log off/in, and the files dissappeared
