2009-10-19T12:11:00.000Z	FluxD		Is there a way to restrict a certain application from accessing the internet?
2009-10-19T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	you could set its to have a proxy of some made up IP, it wont connect then
2009-10-19T12:12:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	what if it doesnt have proxy support?
2009-10-19T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	then you will have to configure your firewall to block the app / port it uses
2012-01-11T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	that is global menu

2012-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	thanks, I dont know why ubuntu devs are making ubuntu more and more like a mac....
2012-01-11T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	they aren't
2012-01-11T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	I'm running 12.04 pre-release and it looks like this: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/Desktop.png   Looks nothing like a mac
2012-01-11T02:58:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	kde ?
2012-01-11T02:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	lxde + openbox
2012-01-11T02:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	looks nothing like a mac does it...
2012-01-11T02:59:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	yea I am talking about default gnome version not something you customized :p
2012-01-11T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	that's Lubuntu (an official release) with a changed wallpaper and Faenza icon theme....
2012-01-11T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	you mean "the Gnome Desktop is looking more like a mac"
2012-01-11T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	Gnome is only default in ONE of the ubuntu family of releases....
2012-01-11T03:02:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	and the most used, most consider it kind of the "original"
2012-01-11T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	irrelevant, Linux is as flexible and changeable as youo like
2012-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	then explain why I cannot move my unity launcher, to simply reposibition it the way like you have yours
2012-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	you can move it to the bottom with a ppa if you want
2012-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	you can move it if you want, you just need to recode it
2012-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	FluxD	ActionParsnip	thats what I meant, I need an unofficial ppa to do it
2012-01-11T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	you can recompile it
2012-01-11T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FluxD	he's never liked gnome
