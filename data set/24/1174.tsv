2012-03-01T21:20:00.000Z	Pecker		does anyone hav ekeyboard and mouse freeze issues with 10.04 on certain computers?
2012-03-01T21:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	do they freeze with other keyboards?
2012-03-01T21:22:00.000Z	Pecker	ActionParsnip	its not a keyboard hardware issue that i find, although will have to try that... same keyboard works fine on another 10.04 machine,its a newer corei5 that hates it
2012-03-01T21:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	is the ram healthy?
2012-03-01T21:22:00.000Z	Pecker	ActionParsnip	yeah, runs win7 and 9.10 just fine. even threw in new ram when the old sticks hated me
2012-03-01T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	maybe its a bug  with the new kernel. I would test the ram just in case
2012-03-01T21:26:00.000Z	Pecker	ActionParsnip	runing memtest86 now...
2012-06-21T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	its not a different distro, its just some different apps
2012-06-28T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	don't use it then, you don't have to use Unity...
2012-06-28T01:15:00.000Z	Pecker	ActionParsnip	what you think I actually use 12.04? using 10.04 right now
2012-06-28T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	you can use gnome-panel in Precise, you can also install any of the many desktop / window managers and not get Unity
2012-06-28T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	Kubuntu 12.04 doesn't have Unity, nor does Xubuntu 12.04, nor does Lubuntu 12.04
2012-06-28T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	I use 12.04, no unity here
2012-06-28T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	I suggest you use Xubuntu 12.04 when Lucid is EOL next year in April
2012-06-28T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	Lucid DESKTOP is EOL in April 2013
2012-06-28T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Releases
2012-06-28T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	if you use Gnome apps a lot, XFCE is built using GTK so will mea you install fewer deps
2012-07-01T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	file /path/to/link
2012-07-30T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	packages.ubuntu.com lists the compatible chips to each driver packages,or you can use apt-cache show  to display the same info
2012-09-19T09:20:00.000Z	Pecker	ActionParsnip	or I recommend grub GUI apps cause it makes life much easier than dealing with the complex mess of grub2. i miss ye old menu.lst
2012-09-19T09:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	just move the entris in /etc/grub.d and it changes the order. You can put memtest at the top if you like. grub 2 is waay easier then old grub as the changes stay each time as the configs set it up how ou want
2012-09-19T09:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	plus grub2 can boot ISO files :)
2012-09-19T09:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	add the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-09-19T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pecker	only you see your highlights
