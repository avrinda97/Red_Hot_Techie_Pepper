2010-03-16T19:34:00.000Z	robert__		hi dr. willis sorry for not paying attention...after your instructions it says mount: /dev/sdb: unknown device
2010-03-16T19:35:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	type 'ls /dev/sd*'
2010-03-16T19:36:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	you're trying to mount sdb?
2010-03-16T19:36:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	it looks to not be partitioned
2010-03-16T19:37:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	type 'sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb', then quit and tell me what partitions you saw there
2010-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	you did that through sudo?
2010-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	if you don't use sudo, it won't read the drive
2010-03-16T19:42:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	yes; also try it in another computer, with a different version of linux or with windows or macos, to see if any of those can read the drive
2010-03-16T20:01:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	do you have important files on there, or can it be erased?
2010-03-16T20:02:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	yes i want the files on it
2010-03-16T20:03:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	well, it depends how it's corrupted... data retrieval can be a nontrivial task
2010-03-16T20:04:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	ok..lets do it...lets get this non-trivial data back
2010-03-16T20:04:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	what are my non-trivial options
2010-03-16T20:04:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	actually, I'm supposed to be at lunch now... I'll be back in ~35 minutes, but even then, I can't guarentee anything... im not an expert
2010-03-16T20:05:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	the first thing I would try though, is pulling an image with dd, and if that fails, with dd_recover or dc3dd
2010-03-16T20:05:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	thats ok..go have lunch and hit me back when u r ready
2010-03-16T20:05:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	you can look those up and figure out how to do that, you don't need me to look down those paths
2010-03-16T20:05:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	ok will do
2010-03-16T20:05:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	/dev/sdb
2010-03-16T20:30:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	im back, did you manage to start pulling an image?
2010-03-16T20:30:00.000Z	robert__	arathald	can't make image casue can't see device
2010-03-16T20:31:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	can't see /dev/sdb anymore at all?
2010-03-16T20:33:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	repost, im not going to search through my log
2010-03-16T20:34:00.000Z	arathald	robert__	pastebin, not in the channel
