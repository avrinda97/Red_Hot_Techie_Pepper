2005-10-26T09:14:00.000Z	strannik		the problem is the following: i'm getting sound (like from xmms) and amorok, but I am not able to change the volume
2005-10-26T09:14:00.000Z	strannik		it just sounds on the maximum..and thats all
2005-10-26T09:15:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	double-click on the volume icon, and see if it changes when you adjust the PCM or PC speaker.
2005-10-26T09:16:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	Then right-click the volume control icon and select the device you want to adjust (sometimes Ubuntu doesn't detect which hardware is it supposed to adjust).
2005-10-26T09:24:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	try the other controls.
2005-10-26T09:25:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	they do not do anything
2005-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	in xmms in the options i am using out put plugin: ALSA 1.2.10 (libALSA.so)
2005-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	I'm using the OSS output plugin
2005-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	maybe you need more plugins?
2005-10-26T09:27:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	when i pull the volume regulater all the way down, it mutes
2005-10-26T09:28:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	what happens when it's all the way up?
2005-10-26T09:28:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	so it's all or nothing
2005-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	I think one of the controls regulate the volume.
2005-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	yup
2005-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	depends on your sound card, of course.
2005-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	going to check in kmix again
2005-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	any ideas on what i can do to make the sound work properly?
2005-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	try the forums.
2005-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	sorry I can't help you much more. =/
2005-10-26T09:33:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	you could also research how to configure ALSA.
2005-10-26T09:33:00.000Z	strannik	aeon17x	thank you for your effort...
2005-10-26T09:34:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	no problem, good luck
2005-10-26T09:45:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	press Q to quit man/info.
2005-10-26T09:49:00.000Z	aeon17x	strannik	That's one persistent process you got there.
