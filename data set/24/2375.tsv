2010-06-06T17:40:00.000Z	ManDay		I bound Hibernation to the PWR-Button on the case. When I press it, the computer goes into hibernation as expected. When I press it again, it comes back up. But I'm only back on the desktop for a few seconds and it hibernates again! When I then bring it back a second time, it stays on-line. Can anyone help?
2010-06-06T17:42:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	sounds like a bug. You could search launchpad for related issues
2010-06-06T17:49:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	there are several hibernate issues in LP.
2010-06-06T17:51:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	self hibernation included?
2010-06-06T17:53:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	don't know. a quick search for hibernate gives *many* related issues. If your issue is not mentioned, you could go and create your own bugreport
2010-06-06T17:58:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	how would that help me? a bug which no one else appears to be having and no way to determine why it occurs?
2010-06-06T17:59:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	If no one would submit bugreports.. ah well, nvm
2010-06-06T17:59:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	yeah , nvm , maybe it would help if you first think and then suggest

2010-06-06T18:07:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	nvtl i don't see a point in reporting this because I don't think it will take it anywhere
2010-06-06T18:09:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	I find that on several bugreports the comments are more useful (and sometimes even provide fixes). Especially when there's hardware concerned.
2010-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	do you want to save the English language from degenerating :D ?
2010-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	you are a bout a few centuries too late for that :P
2010-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	wajiema Mangled English is hard for non-native English speakers
2010-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	ok :)
2010-07-22T13:19:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	what are you using, gnome? xfce? ..
2010-07-22T13:21:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	gnome - timboy who just left recommented conky - i think that sounds good IF that includes adding appointments and so on
2010-07-22T13:22:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	no clue 'bout that.. sorry.
2010-07-22T13:23:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	ok, if you know something for gnome let me know - otherwise i ll leave timboy a message
2010-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	this is not gentoo help channel, sorry
2010-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	then ask there, not here
2010-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	ManDay	oCean_	I asked how ubuntu gets this working - this has nothing to do with gentoo
2010-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	your issue is on gentoo. Stop asking here.
2010-08-07T15:25:00.000Z	oCean_	ManDay	and it works fine using ubuntu right? Only gentoo fails
