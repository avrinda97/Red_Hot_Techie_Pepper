2008-03-30T21:51:00.000Z	azuk1		I have a neat question.. anybody got VirtualBox to run?... It bugs me about permissions and stuff... maybe somebody know how?
2008-03-30T21:52:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	i use virtualbox every day
2008-03-30T21:52:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	I want too also!
2008-03-30T21:52:00.000Z	azuk1		:)
2008-03-30T21:52:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	I run the program sudo root
2008-03-30T21:53:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	you have to add your user to the virtualbox users group
2008-03-30T21:53:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	have you done that?
2008-03-30T21:53:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	I typed in some commands I found at google (chmod I think)... but it didn't work
2008-03-30T21:53:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	maybe gui would be better for you
2008-03-30T21:54:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	yes, when I start from the terminal normal, (./) I get: you have to asdd to the users blablabla
2008-03-30T21:54:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	assuming you are on gnome...System->Administration->Users and Groups
2008-03-30T21:54:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	when I do the sudo, it's ok.. starts up..
2008-03-30T21:54:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	the GUI always works, but wants me to add to the user groups, do you know how to?
2008-03-30T21:55:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	go to System -> Administration -> Users and Groups
2008-03-30T21:55:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	once that is open, click the "Manage Groups" button
2008-03-30T21:57:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	when I change it, close and recheck, it's unchecked again
2008-03-30T21:58:00.000Z	jester7	azuk1	now that's odd
2008-03-30T21:58:00.000Z	azuk1		oh.. wait
2008-03-30T21:58:00.000Z	azuk1		it's there o/

2008-03-30T21:58:00.000Z	azuk1	jester7	no re-login ?.. should work straight away?
