2005-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	Ryan_		lol Jormundgand, unfortunatly its to do with my HDD. I think its got a corrupt sector in it if thats the correct term. basicly when ever it gets to a certain part of it i hear it clicking like its jumping, then my screen frezes and i get the blue screen of death
2005-06-06T10:21:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	you get a BSOD on ubuntu?
2005-06-06T10:21:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	your HD is on its death throes
2005-06-06T10:21:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	save what you can quickly and buy a new one

2005-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	as seq said, burn off your valuable (pR0n) data b4 dealing further
2005-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	Ryan_	nalioth	i burn all porn to disc anyway. Too much for one hard drive im afrais :P
2005-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	a wise choice (keeps snoops from find it easily)
2005-06-06T10:25:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	i agree don't mess with it at all. call compaqs WonderFul customer svc and ask them what to do
2005-06-06T10:26:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	otw, you may void warranty
2005-06-06T10:26:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	its in a lappy?
2005-06-06T10:26:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	say goodbye for a while
2005-06-06T10:27:00.000Z	Ryan_	nalioth	yes
2005-06-06T10:28:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	one of my clients kids has a HP lappy with a prob i could fix in 5 minutes onsite. however it's under warranty and the parents would rather send it off for 3 weeks
2005-06-06T10:28:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	to solve future probs with lappys, buy yourself an iBook
2005-06-06T10:28:00.000Z	Ryan_	nalioth	thats exatly what i hate. sending it off and haveing geeky bastards searching for porn so they can back it up for free
2005-06-06T10:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	yes iBooks can be had under $999usd (or cheaper, if ya have the student discount)
2005-06-06T10:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	in your case, you
2005-06-06T10:37:00.000Z	nalioth	Ryan_	prob unrecognizable
