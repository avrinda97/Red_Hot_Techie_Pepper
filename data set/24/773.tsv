2011-01-31T07:16:00.000Z	themonarch		I need my Ubuntu to access more memory from my 2tb external hard drive
2011-01-31T07:16:00.000Z	themonarch		i think it only uses 3 or 4 gigs
2011-01-31T07:17:00.000Z	themonarch		-__-
2011-01-31T07:17:00.000Z	themonarch		my norm OS is vsta
2011-01-31T07:17:00.000Z	species	themonarch	actually thats a good point...
2011-01-31T07:18:00.000Z	species	themonarch	you seem to be confused between RAM and disk volume
2011-01-31T07:19:00.000Z	species	themonarch	with the external disk mounted, type on the terminal   df -aH
2011-01-31T07:21:00.000Z	species	themonarch	follow our instructions man
2011-01-31T07:21:00.000Z	species	themonarch	you know how to open a terminal? do so and type    df -ah
2011-01-31T07:22:00.000Z	species	themonarch	paste what it echos back to you into paste.ubuntu.com
2011-01-31T07:23:00.000Z	species	themonarch	just to clarify, did you say ubuntu is installed on the external hard disk?
2011-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	species	themonarch	well, line 14 indicates that your disk is working properly
2011-01-31T07:25:00.000Z	species	themonarch	there's more than that...
2011-01-31T07:26:00.000Z	species	themonarch	yes
2011-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	species	themonarch	you can put all those commands on one line
2011-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	species	themonarch	the ; makes sure they wait
2011-01-31T07:38:00.000Z	species	themonarch	im thinking... how come your disk is mounted as /host
2011-01-31T07:40:00.000Z	species	themonarch	yes
2011-01-31T07:50:00.000Z	species	themonarch	i wouldnt, if thats what you are booting from
2011-01-31T07:52:00.000Z	species	themonarch	that sounds like the windows partition
2011-01-31T07:54:00.000Z	species	themonarch	the normal way to dual boot is to split the internal HDD of the laptop
2011-01-31T07:54:00.000Z	species	themonarch	the installer makes this easy as pie
2011-01-31T07:56:00.000Z	species	themonarch	are you running in wubi? or booting natively
