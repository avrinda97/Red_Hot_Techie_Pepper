2007-02-11T11:50:00.000Z	qid		although... strangely, df -h does not show a / or /home mount point
2007-02-11T11:50:00.000Z	qid		that doesn't seem right
2007-02-11T11:50:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	 try  fdisk -l
2007-02-11T11:51:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	no results
2007-02-11T11:51:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	try fdisk -l /dev/hda
2007-02-11T11:52:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	I have hda1, 2, and 5
2007-02-11T11:54:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	and what do you get when you do   fdisk -l /dev/hda ?
2007-02-11T11:55:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	it shows three partitions, hda1, 2, and 5
2007-02-11T11:55:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	you were just looking for its size right?
2007-02-11T11:56:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	I suppose, mostly just curious why nothing shows up in df -h or mount
2007-02-11T11:56:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	i dont know..reboot and see if it recovers
2007-02-11T11:57:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	that sounds like a Windows solution :-\
2007-02-11T11:57:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	no, sometimes you must..you just started didnt you?

2007-09-03T15:09:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	give me a chance to look
2007-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	which interface you want up at boot?
2007-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	eth1
2007-09-03T15:11:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	it wont because of  iface eth1 inet manual  <-- manual
2007-09-03T15:12:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	um, that's not what manual means
2007-09-03T15:13:00.000Z	bulmer	qid	 as you are well aware it wont start at boot noh?
2007-09-03T15:14:00.000Z	qid	bulmer	no, it doesn't start *properly* at boot.  it brings the interface up but doesn't start wpa_supplicant, so the roaming doesn't kick off, so it doesn't get the right address and such
