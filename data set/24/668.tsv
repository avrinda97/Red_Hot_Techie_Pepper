2011-04-02T15:55:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	mr_boo_ltp	sda is your disk, you ought to be able to tell it to partition it from beginning or end. i don't know your hardware though
2011-04-02T15:56:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	mr_boo_ltp	is there more than one disk? sda and sdb etc?
2011-04-02T15:56:00.000Z	mr_boo_ltp	benzaldehyde	nope
2011-04-02T15:57:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	mr_boo_ltp	it would help if you outlined an object

2011-04-02T15:58:00.000Z	mr_boo_ltp	benzaldehyde	the first partition will expect to be labelled as the first one due to the contents
2011-04-02T16:00:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	mr_boo_ltp	the first partition you decide to do no matter what the size or from what end of the volume ought to be sda1 so long as it is a primary partition, i would thing
2011-04-02T16:00:00.000Z	benzaldehyde		*think
2011-04-02T16:03:00.000Z	mr_boo_ltp	benzaldehyde	yes they are labelled after order of creation
2011-04-02T16:03:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	mr_boo_ltp	okay so how can i help
2011-04-02T16:04:00.000Z	mr_boo_ltp	benzaldehyde	i've created them in an undesired order so my partition at the beginning is sadly sda2
2011-04-02T16:05:00.000Z	mr_boo_ltp	benzaldehyde	i'd like it to become sda1 without having to remove the other partitions
