2010-07-18T18:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	it won't do what exactly?
2010-07-18T18:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	I am not trying to be difficult but me guessing what you mean exactly will take longer then you spelling it out
2010-07-18T18:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	check your attitude. I am trying to help you here. MY sound works perfectly.
2010-07-18T18:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	super, have a great day then.
2010-07-18T18:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	and then you said it didn't work
2010-07-18T18:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	your sentences are just vague enough to make me have to ask wehat exactly you mean. Now if you want some help you are going to have to help us by answering our questions.
2010-07-18T19:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	which also means you can backup that .deb so that you can easily reinstall later if need to
2010-07-19T19:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	yes, you won't have the normal AOL connection software you are used to but that link provided above should help you to connect to the internet using AOL servers
2010-07-19T19:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	Also iirc AOL tech support ( some of the people) will help you with connection issues, even if you are not using AOL software.
2010-07-19T19:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto
2010-07-19T19:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	there is no magic channel or button. You are going to have to go to that link I just gave you and read some
2010-07-19T19:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	if you need DNS server info you can call AOL and they will give you the info
2010-10-21T09:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	john38	go with the Ubuntu ones if they work well for you
