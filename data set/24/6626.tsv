2005-09-12T12:05:00.000Z	Hoxzer		is there any filesystem that can be read by both linux and windows?
2005-09-12T12:06:00.000Z	Hoxzer		dabar: oops
2005-09-12T12:06:00.000Z	Hoxzer		I meant write
2005-09-12T12:06:00.000Z	Hoxzer		dabar: ok....
2005-09-12T12:07:00.000Z	Hoxzer		wich is better or faster ext3 or vfat ?
2005-09-12T12:08:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	i don't think windows can natively read ext3, but there is a program available that will read your ext3 partitions. i dont know how well it works for transferring files
2005-09-12T12:08:00.000Z	Hoxzer		:D ... that sucks
2005-09-12T12:08:00.000Z	Hoxzer		quinthius: ok ...., can it read ext3
2005-09-12T12:08:00.000Z	Hoxzer		?
2005-09-12T12:09:00.000Z	Hoxzer		I wonder why dont I just check it :D I have ext3 and windows XP installed
2005-09-12T12:09:00.000Z	Hoxzer		but it will require boot ;/
2005-09-12T12:10:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	the program i used very briefly could read ext3, but i didn't try writing to ext3
2005-09-12T12:10:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	if you want a drive or partition to act as storage to be used by both OS's, i would suggest making it fat32
2005-09-12T12:11:00.000Z	Hoxzer		quinthius: is fat32 slow?
2005-09-12T12:11:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	you tell me... haven't you used it in windows? :P
2005-09-12T12:12:00.000Z	Hoxzer		Quithius: I dont remeber :E
2005-09-12T12:12:00.000Z	Hoxzer		only ntsf
2005-09-12T12:13:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	well if you're used windows before 2000/XP, chances are you've used fat32. but anyway, i'm sure it is less efficient than ext3, and less secure (no journalling), but it's really the only decent option i know of
2005-09-12T12:14:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	what are you going to be using this for? just a shared partitiong/drive between the two OS's? or for what to install linux on?
2005-09-12T12:14:00.000Z	Hoxzer	Quinthius	just for storage no OS installed in it
2005-09-12T12:15:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	ok... yeah i would go with fat32 (vfat) unless someone can suggest another that can be reliably read and written from windows..
2005-09-12T12:16:00.000Z	Hoxzer		quinthius: ok....
2005-09-12T12:16:00.000Z	Hoxzer		:D I will lose like most of my porn
2005-09-12T12:16:00.000Z	Quinthius	Hoxzer	good, it's garbage anyway :P
