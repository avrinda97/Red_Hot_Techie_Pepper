2008-04-30T08:35:00.000Z	eboyjr		Its hard to tell where the mirrors are when you download Ubuntu, its poorly done
2008-04-30T08:36:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	It's designed that way to make it less confusing for you...
2008-04-30T08:37:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	archive.<country_code>.ubuntu.com performs some magic to redirect you to your fastest local mirror...
2008-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	Unfortunately the open source alternatives aren't really ready yet, so Adobe is still the only real choice for now.
2008-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Okay,.. Thanks
2008-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	He didn't, that's just the main reason for Flash these days  :P
2008-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	haha i know.. thats funny
2008-05-01T06:30:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	There's no way anyone would care about getting ads working  :)
2008-05-03T05:11:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	look in /usr/lib/xscreensaver/ for the screensaver and delete the file... every time the package updates, the screensaver will come back though.
2008-05-03T05:12:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Thanks... I'll try it
2008-05-05T00:26:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	'q'
2008-05-10T04:41:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	sudo chown -R eboyjr /home/<you>
2008-05-10T04:42:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Thanks... would I also chmod with 664?
2008-05-10T04:43:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	no need.
2008-05-10T04:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Because now I have to call sudo ls -l to acces the permissions information... It says permission denied
2008-05-10T04:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	It only works when I call sudo
2008-05-10T04:44:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	yes, because your user doesn't own those files... my command will have you own it.
2008-05-10T04:45:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	After that command, it still doesnt work
2008-05-10T04:45:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	what is the error?
2008-05-10T04:46:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Just of bunch of: ls: cannot access /var/www/web: Permission denied
2008-05-10T04:46:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	Heh, you look busy :)
2008-05-10T04:47:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	add your user to /etc/group under 'www-data' and log out and back in.
2008-05-10T04:51:00.000Z	eboyjr	fde	I dont have a www-date group
2008-05-10T04:52:00.000Z	fde	eboyjr	www-data ... look harder, it's a default group.
