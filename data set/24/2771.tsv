2008-12-19T22:40:00.000Z	savid		but I have access to root on both machines
2008-12-19T22:42:00.000Z	savid		but when I ssh into the server,  the $DISPLAY variable is empty
2008-12-19T22:44:00.000Z	savid		does -X forwarding require ports other than 22 to be open at the firewall?
2008-12-19T22:46:00.000Z	savid		hmm.  I just set  ForwardX11 to "yes" on my ssh_config on the client.  Still no worky
2008-12-19T22:47:00.000Z	hischild	savid	you have to connect using ssh -X (capital X, not lowercase) <remote host>.
2008-12-19T22:47:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 I'm using capital X
2008-12-19T22:49:00.000Z	hischild	savid	so let me get this right ... you're connecting via ssh -X <host>, and the $DISPLAY variable remains empty?
2008-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	savid	hischild	  yes,  $DISPLAY is empty on the server
2008-12-19T22:50:00.000Z	hischild	savid	The server on a local network? if so, please tell me the line you're using to connect.
2008-12-19T22:51:00.000Z	hischild	savid	copy paste the line please
2008-12-19T22:51:00.000Z	savid	hischild	I'm not giving out my hostname
2008-12-19T22:53:00.000Z	hischild	savid	set DISPLAY variable on the server to localhost:10.0 and see if it forwards.
2008-12-19T22:54:00.000Z	savid	hischild	nope, didn't work
2008-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	hischild	savid	give it a go with -Y instead of -X.
2008-12-19T22:56:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 tried -Y,  no difference
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	hischild	savid	ok ... do this --> export > file.tmp, then star out any info you can't give, and pastebin the result.
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 on the server or client?
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	hischild	savid	login with ssh -X <host> then do the export
2008-12-19T23:03:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 http://pastebin.com/m6feb8f3d
2008-12-19T23:06:00.000Z	hischild	savid	tnx for doin that. No offense, but did you really connect with the -X option? Because according to that file, you just connected. You're missing about 3-4 declares.
2008-12-19T23:07:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 I promise.  I used   ssh -X (capital X).  Many many times :)
2008-12-19T23:08:00.000Z	hischild	savid	only reason i can think of is that the return path is somehow not available. Please do as cwillu asked.
2008-12-19T23:12:00.000Z	hischild	savid	ping/pong is a check to make sure you're still there
2008-12-19T23:32:00.000Z	savid	hischild	 yeah, checked  .bashrc on the server.  nothing.
