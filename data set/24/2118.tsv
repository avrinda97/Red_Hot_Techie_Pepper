2012-10-28T01:22:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		it simply says to make, make install
2012-10-28T01:24:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		allquixotic, try ActionAZ from the ubuntu store
2012-10-28T01:25:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		ownload%3D
2012-10-28T01:25:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		oops
2012-10-28T01:26:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i have the 1.2.0 version
2012-10-28T01:28:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	that looks interesting, but it doesn't have an event for when a network interface connects
2012-10-28T01:29:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	it has image recognition...
2012-10-28T01:30:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	ipw3945 is pretty obsolete. All of the wireless chipsets that it used to support have (AFAIK) been supported for a long time now by built-in drivers in the Linux kernel.
2012-10-28T01:32:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	i wont ever run a .10 distribution again, too many headaches
2012-10-28T01:34:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	your laptop supports WiFi chipsets from multiple hardware vendors. Without having you run `lspci -nnvv` and telling us the PCI ID of your wifi adapter, it is impossible for us to know which driver to tell you to install.
2012-10-28T01:35:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	bcm4311
2012-10-28T01:35:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	is that what u were asking for?
2012-10-28T01:35:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	BCM4311 is a Broadcomm chipset. No wonder an unmaintained Intel wireless driver from ~2008 doesn't work.
2012-10-28T01:36:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	oh those one sec

2012-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	Try: lsmod | grep wl
2012-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	thats exactly what lspci says about my netwrok controller
2012-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	I know... so... you need to try to blacklist the wl driver and use b43. You can blacklist it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf -- just add "blacklist wl" to the top of the file
2012-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	i was reading the sudo install firmware
2012-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	yeah, that one may work too
2012-10-28T01:42:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	try a few things but your goal should be to get the b43 kernel module loaded and working, and make sure "ssb" isn't loaded, nor "wl"
2012-10-28T01:43:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	allquixotic	thanks for helping me find the road
2012-10-28T01:43:00.000Z	allquixotic	XiaolinDraconis	it does no good to try and find drivers by looking up laptop model numbers, since the internals can be so varied that you get led *far* astray by trying to install drivers for a chipset you don't even have.
