2007-12-05T04:50:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	do you have hardware rendering working? try   fglrxinfo
2007-12-05T04:51:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	does it say it's enabled when you use fglrxinfo | grep Direct
2007-12-05T04:52:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	what module are you using for your video card?
2007-12-05T04:53:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	did you manually install a driver for your card? was it from the ATI site?
2007-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	then it's probably not set up properly. try dumping your xfree or xorg log file to pastebin and paste the url here
2007-12-05T04:55:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	teach you to use what? what don't you know how to do?
2007-12-05T04:56:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	xgl?
2007-12-05T04:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	I don't know what you mean by x client
2007-12-05T05:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	sorry I don't even know what you're trying to do. If it's just an xgl problem, you can post the contents of your xorg log file and xorg.conf at pastebin.com and let us know the url to the post. It will help diagnose your problem.
2007-12-05T05:05:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	I'm using xchat. You use it the same way as mirc
2007-12-05T05:07:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	You will only get help that is as good as the questions that you ask. If you want to know how to use something, read the documentation. That's what it's for. If you have a problem, ask specifically about your issue. e.g. "How do I use the internet" is not a good question
2007-12-05T05:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	locate all relevant config files and log files because it's difficult to get you an answer without them.
2007-12-05T05:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	can you find your xserver log file? it should be somewhere near /var/log and be recognizably named. your X config file should be in or near /etc/X11/<xorg or XFree86>.conf
2007-12-05T05:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	kyle__	copy the contents of both of those files to pastebin.com and when you've submitted it, paste the url here
