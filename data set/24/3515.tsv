2008-01-13T23:59:00.000Z	ThipThip		Soundray:  Firefox exhibits the same behaviour with the IP address - it says "waiting" forever.
2008-01-14T00:00:00.000Z	ThipThip		Interestingly, I found another person with the same problem on a forum, and they reported that they could also connect to ibm.com.  I have just tried and indeed I am also able to connect to ibm.com.
2008-01-14T00:01:00.000Z	ThipThip		Soundray:  The problem does not appear to be limited to firefox.  I am unable to use apt-get and unable to connect to IRC.
2008-01-14T00:01:00.000Z	ThipThip		(I am IRCing from a laptop)
2008-01-14T00:03:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	How are you connected to the internet? Are you behind a router?
2008-01-14T00:04:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 Yes, I am behind a router, but I have also tried connecting directly to the cable modem, and I had the same results.
2008-01-14T00:05:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	Hmm.. and firefox is not responding, but you can ping whatever site you want?
2008-01-14T00:09:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	Just for a try. Why don't you set the MTU to 1492 for your network device?
2008-01-14T00:09:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 How do I set the MTU for my network device?
2008-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	first open a terminel and verify your device. ifconfig <--- post your device
2008-01-14T00:11:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 I have run ifconfig.  Of course I am not IRCing from the same computer as the Ubuntu installation, and that computer (my main desktop) is unable to connect to IRC.  What would you like to know from my ifconfig?
2008-01-14T00:11:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 And moreover, how do I change my MTU?
2008-01-14T00:13:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	Clear ;) I am stupid... You can change your MTU with something like 'sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1942'
2008-01-14T00:13:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	1492 <---- Sorry
2008-01-14T00:14:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 My goodness, that worked!  Thank you so much!  Can you explain to me what MTU is and why that was a problem?
2008-01-14T00:16:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	It looks like your provider or your router is blocking some communication ports for data packages. Try to configure your router
2008-01-14T00:17:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 What should I be looking to configure in my router?  Why would this issue not also affect my windows installation on the same machine?  Why does changing the MTU fix the problem?  Is there a disadvantage to leaving the MTU at 1492?
2008-01-14T00:18:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	THe package size of your linux computer is sending '1500' size, where providers normally use 1942. That normally is not a problem because the network interfaces can split packages if they can negociate with eachother
2008-01-14T00:18:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 I think I understand.  I am currently running Coova (based on OpenWRT) on my router.  Which setting should I be looking to change?
2008-01-14T00:19:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	You have to open some communication ports, or tell the system to leave them open. There should be a preset for that kind of thing.
2008-01-14T00:20:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	I have to google for the ports...
2008-01-14T00:22:00.000Z	ThipThip	minimec	 Which ports need to be opened?  I mean, I realize you don't know the numbers off hand, but what are the ports in question used for and how does the packet size relate to these ports?  Also, does windows use an MTU of 1492 and thus was unaffected by this problem?
2008-01-14T00:22:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	Give me a second...
2008-01-14T00:25:00.000Z	minimec	ThipThip	Well no problem, but if you don't configure your router, you will have to do the 'sudo-thing' each time you boot... ;(
