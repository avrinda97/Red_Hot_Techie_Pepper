2009-04-23T19:36:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	yes and no, it's pretty hard to get it working, haven't tried with 9.04 though... and my laptop died
2009-04-23T19:37:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	k
2009-04-23T19:37:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	i think it worked for me, but its been a while
2009-04-23T19:37:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	O_O it works
2009-04-23T19:38:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	make sure it never overheats, my vid card melted =(
2009-04-23T19:38:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	my vid card acts weird
2009-04-23T19:38:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	mine is 2 years old
2009-04-23T19:38:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	yeah mine makes the screen flicker, and it eventually corrupted the vid memory, there's artifacts in the BIOS =|
2009-04-23T19:39:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	k
2009-04-23T19:39:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	mine acts weird as in it dosent seem to work with 3D
2009-04-23T19:40:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	sometimes while returning from standby it gets a gray screen
2009-04-23T19:40:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	but it goes away
2009-04-23T19:40:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	yeah, i'm not buying HP ever again, or a laptop that requires a heavy vid card, netbooks all the way
2009-04-23T19:41:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	i automatically got this, for free, its because they 'stole' my old laptop which died due to the keyboard being broken
2009-04-23T19:42:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	they refused to fix it, so God knows where it is now
2009-04-23T19:42:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	also make sure to close the lid in the center, don't close it on one side, the hinges will break... it's in laptop heaven
2009-04-23T19:42:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	speaking of break, on the top right edge of the screen is broken :o
2009-07-14T01:01:00.000Z	frostburn	racecar56	Meteor```, vlc has them all compiled in, no need for external w32codecs
2009-07-14T01:03:00.000Z	racecar56	frostburn	oops
