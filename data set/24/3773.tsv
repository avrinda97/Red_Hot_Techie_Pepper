2009-05-10T02:04:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	oki. I have a lot of drivers installed, and I can playback files in audio players. It seems too, that drivers are installed
2009-05-10T02:04:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	yet, I hear no sound
2009-05-10T02:05:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	could you have a clue about what im doing wrong
2009-05-10T02:05:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	no. I have upgraded from Ubuntu 7 to 8.04
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	I have tried with pulseaudio
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Muelli	Ljorring	hm. does alsamixer show channels and stuff?
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	without luck
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	how do I check?
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Muelli	Ljorring	execute "alsamixer" :)
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	yes
2009-05-10T02:07:00.000Z	Muelli	Ljorring	stupid question, but are the channels muted?
2009-05-10T02:07:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	I have mute/unmuted like hell on everything I could find..
2009-05-10T02:07:00.000Z	Muelli	Ljorring	 *g* press "m" in alsamixer on the corresponding channel
2009-05-10T02:08:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	but I have a feeling, that it's such kind of an issue Im dealing with
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	no luck
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	Muelli	Ljorring	did the green square toggle? (to indicate it's mutedness..)
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	when I play a random mp3 in totem movie player, it shows the frequence mixer bouncing (the player is outputting something, that looks real)
2009-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	Ljorring	Muelli	yes
