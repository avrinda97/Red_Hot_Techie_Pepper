2010-08-08T15:03:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	Quick quesiton, do you have your BIOS set to BOOT USB devices First ?
2010-08-08T15:04:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	as that erros means, it's not seeing a valid Boot-Device.
2010-08-08T15:06:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	yes, ummm.. when it's booting, on the bios boot screen, can you hit the escape key or F12 maybe and select a boot-device ?
2010-08-08T15:06:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	The boot-manager is "after" install, LILO, Grub etc. this is a problem before that.
2010-08-08T15:08:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	also, if the CD-ISO is corrupt, yo can get this error. Did you MD5 the ISO and burn it slow with your writer ?
2010-08-08T15:09:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	the ISO from a flash Drive works ok ?
2010-08-08T15:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	Ok, that sounds like a CD-Rom Drive or BIOS setting problem then. What Motherboard & CD-Rom drive you using ?
2010-08-08T15:11:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	its a laptop
2010-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	ok, We still can't rule-out that the ISO you burnt to the CD isn't bad. Sounds like the ISO itself is valid, as the flash drive boots it ok. What speed did you burn the ISO to CD at ?
2010-08-08T15:14:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	just for info, I burn all ISO at the Slowest possible speed, usually 2x for DVD and 4x for CD, just to ensure the writer doesn't cause trouble.s
2010-08-08T15:14:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	no burn on cd. Want extract to a external usb hd, boot and install to internal hd.
2010-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	Oh, Ok, I mis-understood. when you say "extract" you mean copy the ISO to the USB drive ?
2010-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	exactly
2010-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	Ok, then you want to Boot that ISO from the USB Disk Drive yes ?
2010-08-08T15:15:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	yes
2010-08-08T15:17:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	that's essentially a Dual Boot System. You've god a couple options, Create a Dual Boot-System and like yoy said, you'l need a boot-manager installed on your Hard-Drive, or, disable the hard Drive in the BIOS, and do a Native Install to the USB drive itself.
2010-08-08T15:18:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	thanks, let me try
2010-08-08T16:57:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	no advance bro :(
2010-08-08T16:57:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	i try boot-menage but doesnt make any diference
2010-08-08T16:58:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	I would do, based on out previos conversation: disable the Internal HD, then install to the USB Drive. If that works, then do a Dual-Boot install, having Grub be your boot-manager.
2010-08-08T16:59:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	already do that,..same error
2010-08-08T16:59:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	you need to verify that the external USB drive is capable of Booting, until you sort that out, ya can't go any further.
2010-08-08T17:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	x86br	Something, and Im not sure what, probably BIOS related, is preventing that Drive from being able to be a Boot-Drive Device.
2010-08-08T17:02:00.000Z	x86br	KE1HA	yea maybe thats it. Im gona leave and buy a flash drive. Nothin more to do :S. Many thanks for the help
