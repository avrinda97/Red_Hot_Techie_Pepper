2007-04-17T13:36:00.000Z	PovAddict		I have a kernel half-installed, how do I ensure the damn thing will run?
2007-04-17T13:36:00.000Z	PovAddict		boot,even
2007-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	what means "half instaled" ?
2007-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	you explain that to me; aptitude says half-configured
2007-04-17T13:37:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	initrd failed to make
2007-04-17T13:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	do you have the error msg? is a custom kernel?
2007-04-17T13:38:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	wow you can install custom kernels from aptitude?
2007-04-17T13:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	no but you can make a deb with fakeroot and all of that and then install it but anyway it is an update from ubuntu repos? if it is you should report the bug...
2007-04-17T13:42:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	the error message was "Initrd failed" or something useless like that; it was like 10 or 15 minutes after it started building the initrd
2007-04-17T13:43:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	it was 10 minutes stuck there until it finally decided to give up; all that time top said 100%wa, but no CPU time on the other "categories"
2007-04-17T13:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	if the initrd has not been correctly the kernel may fail to boot
2007-04-17T13:43:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	I figured that much; how do I make it build?
2007-04-17T13:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	you can make the initrd manually with 'mkinitrd -o /path/to/imag kernel_version'
2007-04-17T13:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	eg 'sudo mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-11-generic 2.6.17-11-generic'
2007-04-17T13:47:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	interesting, there IS an initrd.img-2.6.17-11-386 file on /boot
2007-04-17T13:52:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	erm wtf
2007-04-17T13:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	it was an example.. it is my currently instaled kernel you have tu change names accordingly with the especific kernel version
2007-04-17T13:53:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	it's stuck again now
2007-04-17T13:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	which ubuntu version do you have instaled? edgy 386? i have not see a kernel update recently...
2007-04-17T13:55:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	yeah edgy
2007-04-17T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	'sudo touch /forcefsck'
2008-12-01T04:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	right click on it choose burn to disk
2008-12-01T04:23:00.000Z	PovAddict	erUSUL	no such option
2008-12-01T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	PovAddict	the img shoulb be in equivalent to an iso image so just changing the extension "should work"... do not take my work thought i do not know if iDVD makes some kind of weird image format
