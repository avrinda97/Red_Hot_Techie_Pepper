2012-02-15T00:06:00.000Z	Daemonik1		What "desktop environment" does Ubuntu 11.10 use by default, Unity, correct?
2012-02-15T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	the DE is gnome
2012-02-15T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	unity is only a shell
2012-02-15T00:07:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	So, all of gnome services such as the gnome-settings-daemon are running? Or are you just calling it gnome 'cause gtk is used by many apps?
2012-02-15T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	no, it is Gnome
2012-02-15T00:08:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	And Unity is the composite manager / window-manager / other things a window manager or composite manager should never do such as draw a "dock" and is therefore a "shell". Ah, I see.
2012-02-15T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	you don't have to use unity. Install xfce4 and your OS will look and feel like Gnome2
2012-02-15T00:10:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	Yeah, no, I know that I don't. The problem is that other people installed Ubuntu without knowing that they signed up for a beta-test program. They'd probably be better of with CentOS 6.2 for their particular use case.
2012-02-15T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	its stable..
2012-02-15T00:10:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	That's what they said about Gnome 3 =\
2012-02-15T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	you don't have to use Gnome3
2012-02-15T00:11:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	Calling Ubuntu stable, is like calling an Android ROM that doesn't support Wifi or Bluetooth "stable".
2012-02-15T00:12:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	I know I don't have to use Gnome 3, and I don't. The problem is that this computer illiterate acquaintance of mine installed Ubuntu 11.10 without it being made clear to her that she was signing up for a voluntary beta-testing program (which is basically what Ubuntu is, because you put incomplete projects like Gnome 3 in there).
2012-02-15T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	just because an android rom doesn't have certain features doesn't mean it won't crash more
2012-02-15T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	maybe you should have researched...
2012-02-15T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	in short, if you don't like it, change it. Its that simple
2012-02-15T00:13:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	I'm not the one who suggested Ubuntu to her. I'll be suggesting CentOS 6.2 to her.
2012-02-15T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	why do we need to know this?
2012-02-15T00:13:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	I don't like it and I won't change it - there are healthier eco-systems than Ubuntu.
2012-02-15T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	why are you telling us all this. This is a support channel, no a 'vent your opinions' channel
2012-02-15T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	as long as its suport based its fine, if you want chit chat then #ubuntu-offtopic is the right place
2012-02-15T00:16:00.000Z	Daemonik1	ActionParsnip	I will talk about Ubuntu - which is on topic.
2012-02-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	no, support is the one and only topic
2012-02-15T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daemonik1	as I said.
