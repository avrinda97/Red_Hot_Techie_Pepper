2007-09-13T14:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight		a K3B question: does anyone know whether one can select different tracks of varying audio formats... like .mp3 and .ogg for example, in a compilation to burn to a single cd?
2007-09-13T14:54:00.000Z	usser	livingdaylight	u should be able to
2007-09-13T14:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	usser	you think so in theory?
2007-09-13T14:55:00.000Z	usser	livingdaylight	k3d does conversion of various formats to audop cd format which is cda(cd audio)
2007-09-13T14:55:00.000Z	usser	livingdaylight	to convert mp3 to cda u have to have mp3 codecs installed ogg should give u no pblem

2007-09-13T14:56:00.000Z	usser	livingdaylight	do u have libk3b2-mp3 installed??

2009-03-01T12:30:00.000Z	livingdaylight	usser	as i said this doesn't resolve the problem
2009-03-01T12:30:00.000Z	usser	livingdaylight	the grub may report that kernels are blahblah(intrepid) but they are actually old ones unchanged
2009-03-01T12:31:00.000Z	livingdaylight	usser	well, i chose older ones to try and it takes me to login screen where mouse is frozen
