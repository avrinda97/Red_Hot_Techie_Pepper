2006-06-30T11:58:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew		i recently did an update all through synaptic, and it broke my fglrx drivers (they won't comple). anyone know why or how to fix it?
2006-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew		i'm pretty sure i did that though
2006-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	you need to do what you once did all over again.
2006-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	but what i did no longer works... i think trying to get the linux-restricted-module doesn't work, i can't find the package
2006-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	well nvm, it found them today...
2006-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	just make sure you have multiverse enabled.  also if you google "Seveas ubuntu" i think he has kernels already compiled with the ATI driver on his repos
2006-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	i guess they just weren't released when i tried it yesterday... thanks for having me try it again!
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	you mean from Seveas repos ?  i saw something that looked like fglrx drivers from there.  or a kernel.  memory not great right now.
2006-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	no, just in the multiverse
2006-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	then perhaps you should check out the Seveas dapper repo :)  let me see if i have a link.  i lost all but have backups of -- life sustaining things.
2006-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew		lol
2006-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	please browse this site http://seveas.theplayboymansion.net/seveas/dists/dapper-seveas/
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	how do i add that in synaptic?
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	avis		let me cat my sources.list
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	are you registered so i can PM you ?
2006-06-30T12:08:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	no =/
2006-06-30T12:09:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	i have AIM at this sn though
2006-06-30T12:11:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	Ok I don't get what I'm doing wrong...
2006-06-30T12:11:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	it still won't compile right, but i have the headers and everything
2006-06-30T12:15:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew		how do i stop this error when installing fglrx: "[Message]  Kernel Module : Trying to install a precompiled kernel module."
2006-06-30T12:17:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16849
2006-06-30T12:24:00.000Z	penguinwhoflew	avis	thanks
2006-06-30T12:25:00.000Z	avis	penguinwhoflew	you will still need to refer to the original webpage i posted for the gpg key to access the repo.
