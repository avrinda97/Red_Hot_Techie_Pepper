2007-08-03T12:36:00.000Z	bruenig		looked like you just jumped the gun assigning something as a problem when it wasn't
2007-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	manual mount and fstab are annoying for usbpluggable drives
2007-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	not really
2007-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	yeah there's UUID in fstab, not really convenient for manual every time
2007-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	you don't have to use a UUID
2007-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	I don't know any other distro that uses UUIDs
2007-08-03T12:39:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	in fstab, because /dev/sd* could be a different disk on any given day
2007-08-03T12:40:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	not on any given day, on rare occasions on kernel upgrades but those are very very rare
2007-08-03T12:40:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	and if the kernel changes the convention, the UUID won't work either
2007-08-03T12:40:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	so you are in the same boat regardless, the only difference is that the UUID will fail outright whereas, if something was named what another drive was already named, you get fstab trying to mount it weirdly
2007-08-03T12:41:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	ah
2007-08-10T09:03:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	what?
2007-08-10T09:04:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	yes, despite the fact that Gentoo has no concept of a -dev package
2007-08-10T09:04:00.000Z	bruenig	lockd	you don't find -dev annoying as hell
2007-08-10T09:05:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	it is annoying but it's not a real problem
2007-08-10T09:05:00.000Z	lockd	bruenig	I just pull in kde's devs and I get most everything I will need
