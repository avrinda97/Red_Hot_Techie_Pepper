2010-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	pr0ton		so, i should install the 64-bit version right?
2010-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	pr0ton		so now, are there any issues running the 32-bit stuff on it?
2010-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	pr0ton		i can run it as if it is a normal thing only right, no problems installing a 64-bit version, is ti?
2010-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	pr0ton		anybody?
2010-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	adamkex	pr0ton	all open source software has a 64bit version of it
2010-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	pr0ton	adamkex	what if it doesnt?
2010-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	pr0ton		and what about codecs and all, will the 32 bit versions work?
2010-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	pr0ton		hmmm
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	adamkex	pr0ton	flash does not officially work, but ubuntu should automatically do a workaround so it works
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton		i use default Movie Player
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton		ok, so ubuntu-restricted works right?
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton		Flash doesnt work?
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton		it doesnt even use the 32-bit version?
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	pr0ton		ok, cool
2010-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	adamkex	pr0ton	yes with a 32bit version, it does something weird so it works
2010-05-17T12:58:00.000Z	pr0ton	adamkex	so no issues right?
2010-05-17T12:58:00.000Z	adamkex	pr0ton	don't ask me, i don't use 64bit, but it should work
2010-05-17T12:58:00.000Z	pr0ton		oh ok
