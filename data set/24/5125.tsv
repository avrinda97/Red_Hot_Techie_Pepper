2007-01-31T14:45:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	It looks like you need Apache and Tomcat installed to run that app.
2007-01-31T14:46:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	A Java application server, I believe.  I don't mess with Java.  ;P
2007-01-31T14:47:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	tomcat.apache.org
2007-01-31T14:47:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	geosever is written in java.
2007-01-31T14:47:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	I know, I went to the website.  It's where I got you needing Apache/Tomcat to run it.
2007-01-31T14:49:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	i have a geoserver installed on windows i didnt have to install apache
2007-01-31T14:49:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	Well then, there you go.  Run it on Windows, or figure out how to run it on Linux.
2007-01-31T14:51:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	You know the 'a' in LAMP stands for Apache, right?
2007-01-31T14:51:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	Doesn't that imply that you should install Apache if you want to run the LAMP stack?
2007-01-31T14:52:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	i suppose
2007-01-31T14:53:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	ive installed ubuntu server but it was very difficult for me , so i ruuned back to desktop to find out from here
2007-01-31T14:53:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/Unix+and+Mac+Install#UnixandMacInstall-Unix
2007-01-31T14:54:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	thnx
2007-01-31T14:59:00.000Z	tsoler	po0f	so i dont need apache to install geoserver. Right?>
2007-01-31T14:59:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	It looks like you only need Tomcat.
2007-01-31T14:59:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	I don't know if that brings in Apache automatically or not.
2007-01-31T15:01:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	It looks like it brings in parts of Apache, but not all of it.
2007-01-31T16:04:00.000Z	po0f	tsoler	What is it?
