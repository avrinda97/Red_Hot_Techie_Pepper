2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	drummer		 I have been trying for three days to get help making an HP 4050 print under Feisty.  No one ever seems to respond.  Please help. (2nd request today)
2007-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	how is it connected?
2007-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	direct connection via parallell
2007-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	are you going through the gnome printer setup?
2007-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	yes, the printer is detected an d appears to install but nothing prin ts, If i change the port to lpt1 it tries to print but errors out with an incorrect tray and paper type (which are not in the current configuration!)
2007-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	lpt1 is DOS-speak. What's the real device name where your printer is detected?
2007-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	the connection is "LPT parpart0 HPLIP"
2007-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	is that what's configured at the moment?
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	 yes it is And that does not print at all
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	also there are no error messages, it just does not print.
2007-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	can you open a terminal and change to /var/log/cups
2007-05-01T11:55:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	yes
2007-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	run a 'ls -lrt' to see what the most recently changed file is in there (last line). The error log?
2007-05-01T11:58:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	error_log  owned by lpadmin  and when i cat that file I get "cupsdAuthorize: Local authentication certificate not found!
2007-05-01T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	run 'groups'. Are you in lpadmin?
2007-05-01T12:01:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	yes I am according to the user gui, just typing "groups" I cannot tell from that.
2007-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	'groups | grep -q lpadmin && echo YES, I\'m in lpadmin'
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	well it said "Yes I am"
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	does the date of that file match with your most recent printing attempt?
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	yes
2007-05-01T12:11:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	could you put the entire error_log on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org please
2007-05-01T12:12:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	 I just received a phone call and must leave immediately, I'm sorry especially now that I'm getting assistance - I will be back in about 2.5-3 hours, will you still be on the forum then?
2007-05-01T12:13:00.000Z	soundray	drummer	probably not, but try again occasionally. I think you have a directory permissions problem. Purging and reinstalling cups *may* help. Laters!
2007-05-01T12:14:00.000Z	drummer	soundray	thank you
