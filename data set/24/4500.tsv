2007-03-29T16:41:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Hi There, can I ask a question about Twinview please?  Can twinview be configured so that I have a clone of my desktop going to my TV, and be able to run video in fullscreen through that Clone?
2007-03-29T16:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	someone was here asking a very similar question yesterday, i don't think anyone ever came up with a way to do it... Good luck

2007-11-30T20:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	np, i was thinking ubotu had an avant query, but i guess it doesn't.. but google avant window manager, thats what you want
2007-11-30T20:16:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	looks great
2007-11-30T20:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	if thats your thing i refer the normal Gnome.
2007-11-30T20:17:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	 I'm a new linux user, so I'm experiencing all I can until I settle down
2007-11-30T20:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	understood.
2007-11-30T20:18:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	...I do like gnome...and I'm trying to replace the ubuntu logo with a foot logo, but it's proving more difficult than it should!!!
2007-11-30T20:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	you mean on boot up?
2007-11-30T20:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	why not just try Gnome Debian..lol, it has the foot there.
2007-11-30T20:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	hang on.
2007-11-30T20:19:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	: because I'm struggling with ubuntu at the moment....got to walk before I can run!!!
2007-11-30T20:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	understood.
2007-11-30T20:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	i can't find it unfortunately, it was on GNome-look.org really though its just the icon set, etc.
2007-11-30T20:23:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	: will look at that one
2007-11-30T20:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	gimme a second, i'll brb... i think i have it in my bookmarks onmy laptop
2007-11-30T20:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	wel, i can't find it anywhere, but here's a screenshot of my laptop, to give you an idea...  http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/IndyGunFreak/screenlaptop.jpg
2007-11-30T20:43:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	...ahh I see now
2007-11-30T20:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	but if you want the taskbar change, etc, you have to use avant, but it is a bit of a resource hog(avant is)
2007-11-30T20:44:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IndyGunFreak	...thats good info
2007-12-03T04:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	you can download any startup file you want, and just point ubuntu ati t.
2007-12-03T04:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mikebeecham	greetings.
