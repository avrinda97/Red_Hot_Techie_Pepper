2006-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85>im not giving up but i do believe that in some circumstances like those mentioned issues cli is a step back
2006-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85>and bchunk wasnt designed in linux nor k3b nor gnomebaker ;)
2006-09-07T09:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85>so linux philosophy is take the long road for a shortcut then pull your hair out because we didnt make the prog for you
2006-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85>basically unless you developed the program its futile to try....this bin/cue prob has taken weeks...now thats crazy
2006-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85>yeah....but they work annoyingly
2006-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		lupine_85> no probs

2006-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<lupine_85> dont get me wrong i love linux but this making thing down right impossible by any one other than a cli junkie or programmer attitude is what is wrong with it
2006-09-07T09:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		yeah im just frustrated at the fact its taken weeks for me to arrive at nowhere in win which I HATE it works and it dont take weeks for an answer
2006-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	I think Ubuntu's one of the amny projects working to change that.
2006-09-07T09:23:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	what's your original problem?
2006-09-07T09:27:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	if you want to do lots of customization, or different power user things, there's no way around CLI.  It's less true in Windows than Linux, but even in Windows it's true.
2006-09-07T09:27:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	luckily, CLI is really powerful.  Unluckily, it's ridiculously hard to learn.  That's the whole point of a GUI, and we wouldn't have a computer in every home (in many countries) without a GUI.
2006-09-07T09:30:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	I just saw something earlier today about a tutorial for burning ISO files.  I can't remember where - might have been a video tutorial.  have you searched on ubuntu's site?
2006-09-07T09:30:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	you're trying to burn an 800 MB image? how big is your disk?  CD-Rs are usually only 700 MB I thought.
2006-09-07T09:32:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	thanks for clarifying.  I'll be quiet now.  ;)
2006-09-07T09:34:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	You want to get better at CLI?  I'd just take one task at a time, and figure out how to do it.  Find a tutorial or how-to and go from there.
2006-09-07T09:37:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	what I've done is learned a basic set of commands, and worked from those on specific tasks.
2006-09-07T09:37:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	if you want, pm me and I'll share what I think are the "getting started" commands.  :)
2006-09-07T09:38:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	yeah, I feel your pain.
2006-09-07T09:39:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	I think there's an online version of man, but really your best bet is to look for specific help on a given command.
2006-09-07T09:39:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	for example, I wanted to know what the different colors mean when you do an "ls" command (like dir, for directory).
2006-09-07T09:42:00.000Z	spc	Paddy_EIRE	good luck.  I don't have time to search right now, but I'm sure the answer is out there.
