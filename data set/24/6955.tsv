2005-06-15T15:54:00.000Z	SLicE_		<---noob
2005-06-15T15:54:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	have you looked at your hidden homedir dirs?
2005-06-15T15:55:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	you'll have to elaborate
2005-06-15T15:55:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	open a terminal, and type "ls -a|more" and look for .icewm or something similar
2005-06-15T15:56:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	I have .icewm there
2005-06-15T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	so in the terminal, type "file .icewm" and see what it is
2005-06-15T15:59:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	it says file.icewm
2005-06-15T15:59:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	"file" is a command to tell you what some file is
2005-06-16T16:00:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	so in the term you are asking "file .icewm" to find out what kind of data .icewm is
2005-06-16T16:08:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	my fault its a directory is what is came up as
2005-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	so in the terminal (or you can add .icewm to the end of the url in nautilus) type "cd .icewm"
2005-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	then you'll find your settings files
2005-06-16T16:14:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	you're my hero
2005-06-16T16:32:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	if it's in your $PATH, "limewire.jar" should do it
2005-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	obviously I switched to icewm and now my limewire icon is gone and  I don't know the command  I opened a terminal and typed "limewire.jar" didn't work
2005-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	so do what ^thehatsrule^ suggested
2005-06-16T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	what to you mean standalone/
2005-06-16T11:39:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	I just wanted it without the gnome involved
2005-06-16T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	so use the "K desktop Manager" or kdm
2005-06-16T11:40:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	small clean system just ubuntu and xfce4.  But I can wait til I am more knowledgable
2005-06-16T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	the "gnome desktop mangager" isnt "gnome"
2005-06-16T11:41:00.000Z	SLicE_	nalioth	whats the difference?
2005-06-16T11:42:00.000Z	nalioth	SLicE_	not enough to discuss, they both offer similar experience
