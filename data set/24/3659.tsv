2007-12-03T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia		Galdar rpm is meant for redhat based machines, don't use rpm's on ubuntu/debian based systems
2007-12-03T21:45:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	and using rpm's isnt that dangerous.. depends on the rpm
2007-12-03T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	yes it is dangerous as they will be built against a different host system
2007-12-03T21:45:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	but if possible it'd be better to build and use checkinstall
2007-12-03T21:46:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	i never had any problems back in the day
2007-12-03T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	just because you havn't doesn't mean its fine to do
2007-12-03T21:46:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	and arent they basicly just compressed packages with some info
2007-12-03T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	how do you know ? you don't know what's in them
2007-12-03T21:47:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	yaeh, but u can see whats in them
2007-12-03T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	your missing the point, but this is offtopic
2007-12-03T21:47:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	but as i said. its better to get the sources and use watchinstall or whatever
2007-12-03T21:49:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	doing gcc or glibc from an rpm is NOT a good idea. but then again, doing pebrot might be
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	its nothing to do with ubuntu
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	he's saying that if he has gurb on a hard disk he can't boot from a cdrom
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	ubuntu is not even booting at that point
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	i thought he said that the dvdrom doesnt work
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	correct, his dvd rom doesn't work at all
2007-12-03T21:57:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	in ubuntu nor windows
2007-12-03T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	not when he has grub on his hard disk
2007-12-03T21:58:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	so, it could be a dma/irq problem
2007-12-03T21:58:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	yeah, iknow.. i had a similar problem
2007-12-03T21:58:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	and got it to work with irqpoll option in grub
2007-12-03T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	drc822	it can't be, as he's not even booting ubuntu, so it can't be a kernel parameter
2007-12-03T21:59:00.000Z	drc822	ikonia	the windows part i do not know tho..
