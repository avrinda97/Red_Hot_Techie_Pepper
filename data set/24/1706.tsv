2009-09-30T18:39:00.000Z	cheslyn		guys can you reset any passwd
2009-09-30T18:41:00.000Z	cheslyn		erusul: ok but is it the only passwd that can be reset
2009-09-30T18:43:00.000Z	cheslyn		erusul:a administrator passwd
2009-09-30T18:43:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Boot to recovery mode, use 'passwd your-username-here'
2009-09-30T18:45:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	thanks but not the user passwd
2009-09-30T18:45:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	What then? The 'sudo' password?
2009-09-30T18:46:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	yes perhaps
2009-09-30T18:46:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	But it is the same user password.
2009-09-30T18:47:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	ok but is that the passwd you use to login no
2009-09-30T18:47:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Yes, the same.
2009-09-30T18:50:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	There usually are only two passwords: the user password (used for administration and such), and root password (in Ubuntu, there is no password by default)
2009-09-30T18:51:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	so how do you change the root passwd
2009-09-30T18:52:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Do you REALLY need to do it?
2009-09-30T18:52:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Because 'sudo' (or 'sudo -s') is enough for all commands.
2009-09-30T18:53:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	i know but i really want 2 know if you can tell me please
2009-09-30T18:53:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Run 'passwd root' as root.
2009-09-30T18:56:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	thanks so what do you mean as root
2009-10-01T19:56:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Did you have a root password set? By default, Ubuntu has root account locked.
2009-10-01T20:00:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	yep
2009-10-01T20:01:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Then boot in recovery mode.
2009-10-01T20:02:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	how?
2009-10-01T20:04:00.000Z	grawity	cheslyn	Reboot, choose "recovery mode" from the boot menu.
2009-10-01T20:05:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	after that
2009-10-01T20:11:00.000Z	cheslyn	grawity	r u still there
