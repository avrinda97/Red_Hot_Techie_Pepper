2012-02-13T18:26:00.000Z	BrandonBolton		Has ndiswrapper been working with anyone with 10.04.3? I can not get it to work for me with my Linksys AE1000 wireless adapter.
2012-02-13T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	if you run:  sudo modprobe ndiswrapper    does it help?
2012-02-13T18:28:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	I will try that right now.
2012-02-13T18:30:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	It is complaining about needing a .conf file and how that will be ignored in a future release.
2012-02-13T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	is it in /etc/modprobe.d by any chance
2012-02-13T18:32:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	this is exactly what it says: http://pastebin.com/Fv3j8HG3
2012-02-13T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	run:  sudo mv /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper /etc/modprobe.d/myndiswrapper.conf
2012-02-13T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	and it will be ok
2012-02-13T18:36:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	I just tried that and did modprobe again. I got no errors at all, but I can't connect to wireless still.
2012-02-13T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	if you run:  ndiswrapper -l   does it say driver and hardware are present?
2012-02-13T18:38:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	Yes, it says driver is installed and device is present.
2012-02-13T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	ok, run: sudo depmod -a; echo "ndiswrapper" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2012-02-13T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	then reboot and run:  sudo iwlist scan    do you see wireless networks?
2012-02-13T18:40:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	Okay, I will reboot and run that. I will be back in a few seconds.
2012-02-13T18:47:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	I just restarted then ran sudo iwlist scan and it says that lo and eth0 both do not support scanning.
2012-02-13T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	is the ndiswrapper module loaded?
2012-02-13T18:49:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	I am running 10.04.3 64bit and the driver I choose was also 64bit. Could that be it?
2012-02-13T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	you need to match the archs so that will be correct
2012-02-13T18:50:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	I opened up ndiswrapper and tried to scan and it still said the same thing.
2012-02-13T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	if you run: lsmod | grep ndis   do you see ndiswrapper?
2012-02-13T18:51:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	it says 'ndiswrapper           244800  0'
2012-02-13T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	coolies
2012-02-13T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BrandonBolton	all I can suggest is read:  dmesg | less      to see what happens at boot with the device and ndiswrapper etc. You could even try unplugging the device, wait a short while then shove it back in, see if it makes a difference
2012-02-13T18:53:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	ActionParsnip	Alright, thank you. I will try that.
