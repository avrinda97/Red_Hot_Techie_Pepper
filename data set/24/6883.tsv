2011-06-27T20:54:00.000Z	dean		Hi is there a reason why games don't work on vbox or am I doing something wrong?
2011-06-27T20:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 what games? vbox dosent really do '3d video' very well.
2011-06-27T20:57:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	Hi its neohasreturned from yesterday you ok? Well I tried cue club in the past and I wanted to run american mcgees alice?
2011-06-27T20:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 i doubt if any 3d games will work well in vmware or virtualbox.    Why dont you try them in wine.
2011-06-27T20:59:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	But I thought when you install xp in vbox it users drivers from the installation?
2011-06-27T20:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 virtualbox emulates a video card..
2011-06-27T21:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 theres some 3d support in vbox.. but its limited to special cases i belive
2011-06-27T21:00:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	Oh I see wine is very hard to configure to get things working?
2011-06-27T21:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 ive rarely had issues with wine.. see the wine app database.
2011-06-27T21:02:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	What is front end without sounding thick lol
2011-06-27T21:03:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	Oh ok is playonlinus any good for gaming then?
2011-06-27T21:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 its a fancy front end to wine.. it does the same games that wine can do.
2011-06-27T21:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 PlayOnLinux = is designed to play games on linux in wine...
2011-06-27T21:04:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	Fair enough lol I will give it a bash lol
2011-06-27T21:05:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	I will let you know my findings lol
2011-06-27T21:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 means very little to me :) i got a windows box to play games on.
2011-06-27T21:05:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	For some reason my laptop don't like dual booting
2011-06-27T21:06:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	I love american mcgees alice and cue club only problem lol
2011-06-27T21:10:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	I have installed playonlinux its wine?
2011-06-27T21:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 playonlinux USES wine...   its a front end to wine...
2011-06-27T21:11:00.000Z	dean	dr_willis	Do you know how to install games on it?
2011-06-27T21:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 you can proberly just copy the installed game from your windows drive to your users home dir.. and use wine directly
2011-06-27T21:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	dean	 I dont use PlayOnlinux. check its help docs.
