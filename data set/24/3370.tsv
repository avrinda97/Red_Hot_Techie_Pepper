2008-02-10T00:34:00.000Z	AstorZZZ		so i managed to run gparted on livecd using sudo, but all the menus and buttons are disabled, huh
2008-02-10T00:34:00.000Z	AstorZZZ		how can i resize ntfs partition from ubuntu live cd?
2008-02-10T00:34:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	yes
2008-02-10T00:35:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	yes, how?
2008-02-10T00:35:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	I think gparted can be run from the terminal if you boot from the live cd. plus the installer can split ntfs partitions
2008-02-10T00:36:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	you can't modify partitions and drives that are mounted and being written too...things could get hairy
2008-02-10T00:37:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	So how can i resize ntfs partition from ubuntu live cd?
2008-02-10T00:37:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	so you're saying you've used gparted on the live cd and everything is inaccessible?
2008-02-10T00:37:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	yes
2008-02-10T00:38:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	and you booted from the live CD too to start it? I'm not sure why it wouldn't work then
2008-02-10T00:39:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	true. I don't know why you wouldn't be able to modify things then, unless you had partitions from the drive mounted.
2008-02-10T00:40:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	let's assume drive is mounted(i didnt do it on purpose though), how do i unmount it?
2008-02-10T00:41:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	in the file manager, rightclick the partitions and choose unmount
2008-02-10T00:42:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	done, harddrive unmounted, rerun gparted, still everything disabled
2008-02-10T00:43:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	try rebooting again with the livecd...the livecd, afaik, should not be automounting partitions on bootup.
2008-02-10T00:44:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	gparted shows status - no devices detected
2008-02-10T00:45:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	make sure not to try to mount any partitions or access any files on the hard drive
2008-02-10T01:53:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	turns out you can run gparted from system->administration->partition editor without any problems (all menus are disabled when launched from terminal even after reboot)
2008-02-10T01:54:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	well i'm glad that worked for you...weird that it's locked out from the terminal though.
2008-02-10T01:54:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	and partition editor found bad sectors on the drive :(
2008-02-10T01:54:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	ouch
2008-02-10T01:56:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	i guess that's why i coudnt resize it from live cd installer
2008-02-10T01:57:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	mjw-	either way thanks!
2008-02-10T01:57:00.000Z	mjw-	AstorZZZ	no problem
