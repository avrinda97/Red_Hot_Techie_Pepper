2007-07-18T06:29:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	I've been coming here after I switched to Ubuntu ;p
2007-07-18T06:30:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	good for you.  I am still in love with debian, however I also use ubuntu these days.  I heard 7.04 is good, so I'm giving it a shot.  However I am LOVING debian sid amd64
2007-07-18T06:31:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	I haven't tried any other distros yet. I'm using 7.04 and its everything I expect from an OS. Should have made the switch earlier but its never too late I guess.
2007-07-18T06:31:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	your first time on linux?
2007-07-18T06:31:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	Yeah.
2007-07-18T06:32:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	welcome.  ubuntu is a great distro for newcomers
2007-07-18T06:32:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	Defenitely. I've overcome my phobia of Linux ;D
2007-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	think about using debian at all?
2007-07-18T06:41:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	I don't even know why I'm using ubuntu :(
2007-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	Not really. I was thinking about Fedora so I could use Maya for Linux. I just happened to install Ubuntu after I got it bundled with a Magazine.
2007-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	Nyle	dissection	try debian.  redhat is useless, fedora and all.  in my book, its Debian #1, and Ubuntu #2
2007-07-18T07:08:00.000Z	dissection	Nyle	You need xine for Amarok
