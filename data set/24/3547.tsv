2008-11-09T06:25:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Gnea	yeah, thanks.  I got PS3 stuff, it all works fine, but where do I get the games?
2008-11-09T06:25:00.000Z	Gnea	LetsGo67	i would suggest google. we aren't a game outlet.
2008-11-09T06:26:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Gnea	I tried Google.
2008-11-09T06:26:00.000Z	Gnea	LetsGo67	i have no idea then - maybe #gaming ?
2008-11-09T06:27:00.000Z	Gnea	LetsGo67	maybe you need to modify your google search, it's really an offtopic question for this channel.
2008-11-09T06:29:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Gnea	no matter what I do, no matter what I search, same useless info over and over again.
2008-11-09T06:29:00.000Z	Gnea	LetsGo67	you could try asking in #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-06-24T07:36:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Gnea	Yes.
2011-06-24T07:37:00.000Z	Gnea	LetsGo67	got a picture of said modem?
