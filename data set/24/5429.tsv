2006-08-14T16:46:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	ty
2006-08-14T16:51:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	install linux-headers-`uname -r`
2006-08-14T16:52:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	ah ok, so can i remove the linux-source I just got? :P
2006-08-14T16:52:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	yes
2006-08-14T16:52:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	hehe ok thanks :)
2006-08-14T16:52:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	:)
2006-08-14T16:54:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	ok so i've done that. the answer the program now wants is: /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.15-26-386/include correct?
2006-08-14T16:56:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	it is vmware you are installing?
2006-08-14T16:56:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	You go tit
2006-08-14T16:56:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	the script will find them automatically
2006-08-14T16:56:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	um. the script's default directory was: /usr/src/linux/include, which doesn't exist
2006-08-14T16:57:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	have you run it again since installing the heade4rs?
2006-08-14T16:57:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	lol. I guess that would help, huh? should I do updatedb?
2006-08-14T16:57:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	no. it will find them
2006-08-14T16:58:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	ok I'll give it a whirl. How does vmware work? pretty well? just trying it out
2006-08-14T16:58:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	the vmware people are clever
2006-08-14T16:58:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	i run vmware workstation, and it is excellent
2006-08-14T16:58:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	kewl. I can pretty much just hit enter though all the installation questions, then?
2006-08-14T16:58:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	yes
2006-08-14T16:59:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	kewl. thanks. Reading question FTL
2006-08-14T05:03:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	As this is my first go at vmware, I'm not too sure how this works. I have a separate disk with XP installed. Will I be able to use this install, or should I install XP on another blank disk?
2006-08-14T05:05:00.000Z	mcphail	lmosher	i have never tried mounting existing partitions (but i know you can do this with qemu). vmware will create some files inside your linux partition which will function as virtual drives
2006-08-14T05:05:00.000Z	lmosher	mcphail	ok ty
