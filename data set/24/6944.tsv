2005-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	KrisWood		does that look right?
2005-06-10T08:30:00.000Z	KrisWood		whenever I mount the ntfs filesystem it sets the permissions to 600 with ownership of root
2005-06-10T08:32:00.000Z	KrisWood		hello, anyone, could someone help me with setting up permissions on mounting an ntfs filesystem???
2005-06-10T08:33:00.000Z	KrisWood		hello? ANYONE?
2005-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	KrisWood		I think I might have to ask to ask a question.... and that'd be against the rules and such...
2005-06-10T08:35:00.000Z	KrisWood		heh ok
2005-06-10T08:35:00.000Z	KrisWood		I guess I'll just have to ask over and over
2005-06-10T08:36:00.000Z	KrisWood		no can do, my wife will give me no peace until I fix her windows file systems for linux :p
2005-06-10T08:37:00.000Z	KrisWood		anyone here familiar with fstab at all?
2005-06-10T08:37:00.000Z	KrisWood		lol she dual boots I don't think she'd like that answer
2005-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	You just need to mount the NTFS windows partition?
2005-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	Or is it fat32?
2005-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	Ok. That will be read-only.
2005-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	*nod* Easy enouigh to fix, but they'll still be read-only.
2005-06-10T08:39:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	Because MS aren't releasing ntfs specs.
2005-06-10T08:39:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	That's not going to happen with an ntfs disk.
2005-06-10T08:39:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	If she has ext3 on Linux, she can access that from within WIndows, though.
2005-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	There's explore2fs, which reads and copies data fom ext2/ext3... there's ext2fsd too...
2005-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	And there's the payware ext2fsanywhere as well
2005-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	KrisWood	cafuego	ok I'll look into those
2005-06-10T08:42:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	if neither OSS nor ALSA drivers support it, it won't be happening.
2005-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	Mind you, it may be  afeature the driver authors might add
2005-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	Check the options on the driver, 'modinfo via82cxxx_audio'
2005-06-10T08:44:00.000Z	cafuego	KrisWood	A neat tool that can tell you options for kernel modules.
