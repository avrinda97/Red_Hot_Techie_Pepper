2005-12-10T16:23:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	before the title-lines
2005-12-10T16:23:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	assuming your new image is on first partition of hdb
2005-12-10T16:23:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	where are the title lines
2005-12-10T16:23:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	lines starting with 'title'
2005-12-10T16:24:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	you have them I trust?
2005-12-10T16:24:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	you mean the ones that say ubuntu test, ubuntu kernel, memtest ?
2005-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	yes
2005-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	gparted indicated me ubuntu is on hda6. so its hd6,0 ?
2005-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	did you create a separate /boot-partition?
2005-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	hda = hd0
2005-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	hd0,0 = first partition on hd0 (hda1)
2005-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	so it's hd0,6 ?
2005-12-10T16:27:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	that would be hda7 ;-)
2005-12-10T16:27:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	linux numbers partitions starting with 1. grub starting with 0 :-)
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	so if gparted says ubuntu is on hda6 i should pinpoint grub it's on hd7 ?
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	no. hda = hd0
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	hda6 = hd0,5
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	im lost
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	hda6 = sixth partition of first IDE device
2005-12-10T16:28:00.000Z	czr	phiqtion	hd0,5 is the same for grub
2005-12-10T16:29:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	ok i will try, thank you
2005-12-10T16:53:00.000Z	phiqtion	czr	i just messed up GRUB. im on the live cd. how can i install it back?
