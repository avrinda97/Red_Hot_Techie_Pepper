2008-10-22T20:36:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	That doesn't seem to do anything
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	indian_munnda: Maybe when I pull it out and plug it in again, it wont show til I restart...
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	Yup! it got it
2008-10-22T20:40:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	it has  /mnt/OhmusHDD  but that folder's empty
2008-10-22T20:40:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	I'm wondering if maybe it doesn't 'unmount' when I yank it out.  So next time I plug it in, maybe it wont mount again as it thinks it's already mounted...(?)
2008-10-22T20:42:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	Shouldn't udev detect it's removal and auto-unmount it?
2008-10-22T20:43:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	mount finds 9 entries. /dev/sda3, proc, /sys, varrun, varlock, udev, devshm, devpts, lrm, sercurityfs  - it might be /dev/sda3
2008-10-22T20:46:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	ok ... can I create a udev rule to automate that?
2008-10-22T20:46:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	I don't think it's /dev/sda3 as I tried to umount it, but says 'cant -dev is busy' - but it's unplugged!  So I think that must be some partition of my internal hdd.
2008-10-22T20:47:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	it's a Western Digital HDD.  I don't know what it gets seen as, cos I can't see it right now.
2008-10-22T20:47:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	ok!
2008-10-22T20:49:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	/dev/sdc or /dev/sdc1
2008-10-22T20:50:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	NTFS
2008-10-22T20:57:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	First time it gave '$LogFile indicates unclean shutdown (0, 1) WARNING: Forced mount, reset $LogFile.' and hung there.  and I checked the folder and nothing.  So I ran it again.  this time: 'fuse: failed to access mountpoint /mnt/SamHDD: Transport endpoint is not connected' and still no joy
2008-10-22T20:59:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	/dev/OhmusHDD? yes it's there, just empty
2008-10-22T20:59:00.000Z	DasEi	Ohmu_	what says      mount        now, mounted Hdd ?
2008-10-22T21:01:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	No it hasn't appeared.  mount returns the same readout as before.
2008-10-22T21:02:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	yep . .. soz I changed the name to keep it easy.  must have slipped up tho.. the correct name is /mnt/SamHDD.  Yes the entry is there.  just is an empty folder.
2008-10-22T21:04:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	yep thats the command I've been doing.  It fails.
2008-10-22T21:05:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	Got it! had to umount it, then mount it
2008-10-22T21:05:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	ThankYou!
2008-10-22T21:06:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	 CAn I add umount /mnt/SamHDD somewhere in udev rules?
2008-10-22T21:06:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	(just curious, not gona try tonite)
2008-10-22T21:07:00.000Z	Ohmu_	DasEi	mmk
