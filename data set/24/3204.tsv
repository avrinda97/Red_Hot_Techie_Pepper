2008-09-20T19:00:00.000Z	Joshooa		Okay I have a weird story for you guys, and in the end Ubuntu crashed a few times and then now it's working again and I don't know why
2008-09-20T19:01:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	it might have recovered after 2 or 3 repetitions of fsck
2008-09-20T19:02:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Well it never got that far
2008-09-20T19:02:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	I'm typing it all out though so just a sec
2008-09-20T19:05:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	next time you should pls specify that ur problem was with grphx card, coz it made me first think that you recovered (logically) broken hardisks.
2008-09-20T19:06:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	All i said was Ubuntu crashed, let me tell you, and my first line said, "I was playing with my NVidia settings"....
2008-09-20T19:08:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	oh! graphix card is needed only to run X system properly. You can run cmd line without nvidea settings. so its not right to say ubuntu crashed. the reason may actually be that ubuntu detects and configures cards right if X starts up erratically more than few no. of times.
2008-09-20T19:11:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Ok, Well, I couldn't do anything or log in and the way UBUNTU was running was blocking me from using my computer, and how could the graphics card cause ubuntu to not accept my password on the number pad with num lock on, like I always log in 100% of the times before?
2008-09-20T19:11:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Like I said, I switched to tty1, and tried logging in that way, again, ubuntu was being weird
2008-09-20T19:12:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	you can always use the failsafe kernel and edit the settings of the xorg.conf
2008-09-20T19:12:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	 Okay what do I edit? How do you know that's the problem that caused it crash?
2008-09-20T19:14:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	best what you could do is get it from the backup file, mostly xorg.conf~ else insert live cd, note the setings and paste the changes.
2008-09-20T19:15:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Again though, what at all makes you want to edit that file?
2008-09-20T19:15:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	I see no logical explanation to jump to that and just change my xorg.conf
2008-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	i felt that the reason for failure is only the graphics card and your experimentation. all the changes are made to xorg.conf file.
2008-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	But all I did was change my brightness and contrast
2008-09-20T19:16:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	I also changed settings withing Wine
2008-09-20T19:17:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Neither of those should effect my keyboard input though, so I think there's something else involved I was hoping someone might recognize symptoms
2008-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	i c. actually its not recommended to do any hardware based changes via wine, eg. installing drivers etc.
2008-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	 I ddin't
2008-09-20T19:18:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	i am extremely sorry if i didn't notice that your keyboard input doesn't work.
2008-09-20T19:19:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	That's the REALLY weird thing, it was apparently just the number pad, even though I am positive I checked caps lock and num lock a few times each
2008-09-20T19:19:00.000Z	sriramoman	Joshooa	then i am extremely sorry, i dont have a solution for the problem.
2008-09-20T19:20:00.000Z	Joshooa	sriramoman	Yeah I'm lost too, crazy stuff.
