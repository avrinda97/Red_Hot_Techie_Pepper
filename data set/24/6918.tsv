2005-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	goye2cz		any help to get qjackctl to work?
2005-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	What's your issue with qjackctl?
2005-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	it tells me "could not connect to jack server as client"
2005-06-21T13:10:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	On startup, or when you hit the "start" button?
2005-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	when I hit the start button. Actually when I start it, the terminal gives this message: Warning: no locale found: /usr/share/locale/qjackctl_en_US.UTF-8.qm
2005-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	If you haven't set up your kernel to load the realtime module, you'll need to hit "Setup" in qjackstl and uncheck the "Realtime" module.
2005-06-21T13:12:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	just unchecked it. still no go.
2005-06-21T13:13:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Hrrrrm.  Try "killall esd" in a terminal, and see if qjackctl works then.
2005-06-21T13:15:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	did it, no change.
2005-06-21T13:16:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Dang. :(  I don't know.
2005-06-21T13:16:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	thanks anyway.
2005-06-21T13:17:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Sorry I couldn't help more. It worked pretty well for me after I figured out the realtime thing (though I later installed the realtime module anyway.)
2005-06-21T13:18:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	I'm not getting a response on the ardour channel but they were able to help get it up running once. Don't know what happened after that.
2005-06-21T13:19:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Strange.  I'm hoping to start using Ardour soon to do some recording with my bass. Right now though, my wife and I have been busy fixing up the house. Some family is visiting next week. :)
2005-06-21T13:20:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	small world. same stuff going on over here.
2005-06-21T13:20:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Heehee.  What are you going to use Ardour to record?
2005-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	anything. I jsut finished a small project of reading words for a dictionary program my friend is writing. I used n-track on windows. I've heard such great things about linux, thought I'd give ardour a try.
2005-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	I record guitar though.
2005-06-21T13:23:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Cool. Yeah, I was a fan of CoolEdit in Windows, and after switching to Linux, was wowed by some Ardour screenshots. I'm looking forward to playign with it.
2005-06-21T13:26:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	and you can't beat the price tag with a stick.
2005-06-21T13:28:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	That's for sure. ;) I'm going to be exchanging tracks with a guitarist/drummer friend of mine. We'll be makign songs without even being in the same part of the country. It' sjust a neat feeling.
2005-06-21T13:29:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	sounds nice.
2005-06-21T13:32:00.000Z	goye2cz	tkiesel	I guess I just remembered how I got it working before. I have ardour running now!
2005-06-21T13:32:00.000Z	tkiesel	goye2cz	Awesome!
