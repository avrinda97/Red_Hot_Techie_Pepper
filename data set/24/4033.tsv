2008-06-09T02:57:00.000Z	aguitel		is safe to mark the repo hardy proposed ?
2008-06-09T02:58:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	it's not as safe as the standard repositories, as the software is not as well tested. Ultimately, you have to make this decision for yourself, though.
2008-06-09T02:59:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	why do you want rc2?
2008-06-09T02:59:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	stable version
2008-06-09T03:00:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	do you have stability issues with the beta?
2008-06-09T03:00:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	some times it close
2008-06-09T03:01:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	do you know when? Can you reproduce a situation where it will crash?
2008-06-09T03:02:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	when for example many flash are loading in the site
2008-06-09T03:02:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	the site is very load
2008-06-09T03:03:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	that's much more likely to be an issue with the flash plugin than with firefox itself.
2008-06-09T03:03:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	maybe but with firefox 2 nothigs happens
2008-06-09T03:05:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	okay, I follow your reasoning. If it was my problem, I'd upgrade to rc2, but there can be no certainty that it will 1) solve your current problem and 2) not create new problems.
2008-06-09T03:06:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	when you've done the upgrade, I recommend removing the proposed repository again.
2008-06-09T03:06:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	ok thanks
2008-06-09T03:07:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	I personally use backports and proposed all the time, but I'm a bit adventurous and I trust myself to fix any problems that might arise.
2008-06-09T03:07:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	backports are worse than proposed
2008-06-09T03:08:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	no, they aren't
2008-06-20T21:51:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	you should wait for the point release, scheduled for some time in July
2008-06-20T21:52:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	ok ,but is any hardy release image with all update at now ?
2008-06-20T21:52:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	no
2008-06-20T21:56:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	what is this:http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/hardy/daily-live/current/hardy-desktop-i386.iso  ?
2008-06-20T21:57:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	well spotted, I hadn't heard of this before. Mind you, this is pre-release
2008-06-20T21:58:00.000Z	aguitel	soundray	i think this iso incluide all update till today
2008-06-20T22:00:00.000Z	soundray	aguitel	that's very useful. So, you've answered your own question.
