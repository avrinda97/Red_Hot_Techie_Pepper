2005-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	ndlovu		does anyone know why java's not in the repositories (sun-j2re1.5)?
2005-08-29T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	it's in hoary-extras, but the mirror ahd an inaccurate Packages.gz a few hours ago
2005-08-29T16:34:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	thanks, so in other words just wait for a while until it comes back?
2005-08-29T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	do you have hoary-extras ? If so yes
2005-08-29T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	the other way is to download the deb directly with wget
2005-08-29T16:36:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	but won't that possibly give issues in the future with upgrades and the like?
2005-08-29T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	I meant d/l it from the repo itself
2005-08-29T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	same deb..
2005-08-29T16:39:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	thanks for the advice. will wait a few hours and if it's still not there will try wget.
2005-12-14T06:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	 update-alternatives --config java
2005-12-14T06:07:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	thanks, thats exactly what I needed. Except now java --version says "Could not create the Java virtual machine" :(
2005-12-14T06:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	did you use a java deb or install from the sun installer?
2005-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	was a while back, before I upgraded, but I see jre-1_5_0_01-linux-i586.bin in my downloads
2005-12-14T06:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	if you installed with synaptic, remove with synaptic or apt
2005-12-14T06:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	the removed package will still be in the cache so you can reinstall it after you get a working java
2005-12-14T06:27:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	I still have a java version located at /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.4.2-gcj-4.0-1.4.2.0/ that wasn't installed with apt - how would I get rid of it? rm -rf?
2005-12-14T06:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	no
2005-12-14T06:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	run   update-alternatives --config java
2005-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	- so then just leave the old version installed?
2005-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	that installation is the "free" java installed by default
2005-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	I did - I'm not sure if it would be needed or not
2005-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	possibly it isn't, but I play safe ;)
2005-12-14T06:46:00.000Z	ndlovu	thoreauputic	thanks, java working great now! update-alternatives also good to know about.
2005-12-14T06:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ndlovu	glad to hear it :)
