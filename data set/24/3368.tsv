2008-03-27T22:12:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes		ok, anyone know the command to stop tune2fs from checking the filesystem at launch?
2008-03-27T22:13:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	that's not really a good idea
2008-03-27T22:13:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	well, it's a pain to wait like 2 hours to launch Linux
2008-03-27T22:13:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	checking a non-journal partition?
2008-03-27T22:14:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	kjournald
2008-03-27T22:15:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	i meant the filesystem, ext2 has no journaling, which is why everyone uses ext3
2008-03-27T22:15:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	not sure, it's an andlinux install
2008-03-27T22:15:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	type mount
2008-03-27T22:15:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	kk

2008-03-27T22:19:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	what kind of hard disk do you have?
2008-03-27T22:19:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	it's a disk image
2008-03-27T22:19:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	andlinux lets you load a linux kernel in windows via colinux, so everythings in a disk image or two
2008-03-27T22:21:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	well it's mounted as ext3, so i think it cant be an ext2, but it's still weird it takes so long to check
2008-03-27T22:21:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	there were, I think, directions to disable tune2fs checking or something online, but I can't remember
2008-03-27T22:22:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	man tune2fs
2008-03-27T22:22:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	ok, I'll do that, unless you've got a different idea for me, as I don't want to break stuff =]
2008-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	It will destroy the disk at some point
2008-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	so it's probably not a good idea
2008-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	what will?
2008-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	using tunefs to disable checking the filesystem altogether
2008-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	ok, any other solutions?
2008-03-27T22:24:00.000Z	rexy_	LinuxMercedes	well i have no experience with loading linux the way you do, it probably runs virtualized and using a virtual disk on an image on a filesystem on  a real disk, i imagine that doesnt help
2008-03-27T22:25:00.000Z	LinuxMercedes	rexy_	ok
