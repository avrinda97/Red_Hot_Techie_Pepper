2008-01-05T15:08:00.000Z	osfameron		does the ubuntu live CD have a minimum free HD space requirement?
2008-01-05T15:08:00.000Z	osfameron		my current partitioning is rubbish, the w2k setup barely works
2008-01-05T15:08:00.000Z	osfameron		but ubuntu doesn't seem to want to actually boot in order to let me repartition
2008-01-05T15:09:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	i bleive 2GB
2008-01-05T15:09:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	eeeek!
2008-01-05T15:09:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	on the C: partition?
2008-01-05T15:09:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	cos if so, I'm in trouble.  There's only 1/2 Gb on C:, and it's all full
2008-01-05T15:09:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	there is no C: partition in ubuntu ... heh
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	ok, I mean *free* disk space
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	I mean ubuntu to take all of it when done, but it's not booting up to the bit where I can get to repartition the drive
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	for resizing windows?
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	I want to wipe windows
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	oh just delete windows then
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	as my win setup is totally messed up anyway
2008-01-05T15:10:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	do I have to delete windows before booting the liveCD?
2008-01-05T15:11:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	nope -- in the livecd installer, just choose Delete All Data
2008-01-05T15:12:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	ok - that's what I thought.  I'll try again, but the LiveCD wouldn't boot up last time - just got to screen with mouse pointer and creamy background and stayed there for 15 minutes with no feedback :-(
2008-01-05T15:12:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	try safe mode graphics?
2008-01-05T15:12:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	ok - will that let me install too?
2008-01-05T16:27:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	min is 192MB
2008-01-05T16:27:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	aha.  For the LiveCD or for ubuntu in general?
2008-01-05T16:28:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	ubuntu
2008-01-05T16:28:00.000Z	osfameron	khermans	ah... I thought it could run on a low memory system?
2008-01-05T16:28:00.000Z	khermans	osfameron	look at the live cd requirements
