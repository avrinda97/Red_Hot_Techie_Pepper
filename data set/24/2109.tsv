2012-06-14T08:57:00.000Z	airlynx		My phone doesn't automount and I don't know how to manually mount it and can't seem to find any good answers for 12.04 on how to do it, it's recognized as a mass storage device in lsusb but what do I do from there?
2012-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	are you using udev or no?
2012-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	I don't think so, not really sure
2012-06-14T08:58:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	ok then there are other things that take care of automounting.
2012-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	I don't even really care if it automounts or not, I just need to get into it to transfer some files, not something I do very often
2012-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	mount /dev/phonedevicedrive1 /mnt
2012-06-14T09:00:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	that's where I'm lost, what /dev/phonedevicedrive1 would it be or how do I find out?
2012-06-14T09:01:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	ls /dev |grep sd
2012-06-14T09:01:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	whatever ones arent your hard drive is your phone
2012-06-14T09:02:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	they are all sda or sdb (I have an external drive plugged in right now, so that's probably sdb)
2012-06-14T09:02:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	is your phone set to mountable in the phones os
2012-06-14T09:03:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	yes, when I plug it in it asks if I want to just charge or connect to the PC
2012-06-14T09:03:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	if I select to just charge then it shows up in lsusb as a modem
2012-06-14T09:03:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	connect to pc is usually the phone developers shitty software stuff
2012-06-14T09:03:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	select mount as disk drive
2012-06-14T09:04:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	I've been able to do it before without using any 3rd party software
2012-06-14T09:05:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	you shouldnt need any
2012-06-14T09:05:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	select mount as disk drive? in the phone?
2012-06-14T09:06:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	yeah
2012-06-14T09:07:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	I dont anything like that in the settings anywhere
2012-06-14T09:07:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	what os is your phone
2012-06-14T09:08:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	that is questionable, it's a Samsung Seek, it runs Java apps, lol
2012-06-14T09:09:00.000Z	celthunder	airlynx	lol good luck.  basically once the phone introduces itself as a drive itll show up in /dev
2012-06-14T09:10:00.000Z	airlynx	celthunder	okay thanks, at least I have some idea of whats wrong now
