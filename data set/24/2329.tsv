2009-10-14T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	You need to use either the 64 bit version of Ubuntu or the server kernel
2009-10-14T02:40:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	tried too but for some odd reason it refused to install
2009-10-14T02:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Is it a 64 bit CPU?
2009-10-14T02:41:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	nope an i686 dual-core

2009-10-14T02:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Did it come with 4 GIG of RAM? It would be interesting if it did considering AFAIK windows can't access 4 gig of ram with it's 32 bit version, though linux can :)
2009-10-14T02:44:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	it came with Vista 64-bit pre installed
2009-10-14T02:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	I thought you said it was a 32 bit processor?
2009-10-14T02:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	What problem did you have installing 64 bit Ubuntu?
2009-10-14T02:47:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	well I never got pass the inital installing fhase
2009-10-14T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Stops where? Does the LiveCD boot to a desktop?
2009-10-14T02:48:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	nope it do not
2009-10-14T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Did it give any error message?
2009-10-14T02:49:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	perhaps there is something not right with my burned cd's, I do not know
2009-10-14T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Did you try the self test of the CD at boot?
2009-10-14T02:50:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	nope, I did not
2009-10-14T02:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Of the CD or just the iso file?

2009-10-14T02:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	vieq	Make sure you are using the latest version of Ubuntu ( 9.04 ) or the latest long term support release ( 8.04 )
2009-10-15T20:14:00.000Z	vieq	Jordan_U	hello, I guess I figured out what's the issue with the processor issue I asked couple of days ago
