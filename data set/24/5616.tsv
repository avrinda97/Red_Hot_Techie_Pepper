2010-10-04T04:34:00.000Z	tiox		Hey there.
2010-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	tiox		I came here seeking help on either installing Ubuntu without GRUB, or putting GRUB on a USB drive using the Lucid Lynx alternate CD.
2010-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	tiox		Right now I am at the point where I can pick which install process to do.
2010-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	tiox		Anyone have any idea what I am talking about?
2010-10-04T04:36:00.000Z	tiox		Sure.
2010-10-04T04:37:00.000Z	tiox		How can I do that from the alternate CD installer?
2010-10-04T04:38:00.000Z	tiox		Because I heard it was possible. Figured I would give it a try.
2010-10-04T04:39:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 are you asking how to set up the usb drive?
2010-10-04T04:39:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 easiest solution i found was at pendrive linux.
2010-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 you can do the install from there.
2010-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 let me finish
2010-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 if you build using one of the 'normal' distributions, you can easily edit the menu.lst file to use any other ubuntu cd image.
2010-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 did you notice the 'install' on the desktop of the live session?
2010-10-04T04:40:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 yep
2010-10-04T04:41:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 i'm not exactly sure what you're asking. sound like you just want to boot a 'full' distro install off usb now. is that what you want?
2010-10-04T04:42:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 should work to another usb drive, sure. swap may be tough on the flash, etc. but yeah, that works.
2010-10-04T04:42:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 i suppose it'd work off a cd too.
2010-10-04T04:43:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 i've installed to removable drives, just not flash.
2010-10-04T04:43:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 just be aware that swap may go through your flash drives.
2010-10-04T04:44:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 as i said...
2010-10-04T04:49:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 what i am saying is that you can install to the USB drive like any other. the pendrive linux tool will create the live cd images on usb, which although they can be persistent, is something you say you don't want. so yes it can.
2010-10-04T04:49:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 you can install to the usb, yes. (again)
2010-10-04T04:49:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 i think you'll survive.
2010-10-04T04:50:00.000Z	bobstro	tiox	 now... this assumes the usb drive is large enough, of course.
