2010-07-25T16:48:00.000Z	troubled		did ubuntu break standby mode recently (since last round of updates)? Suspend no longer works. The system just beeps on startup and I am forced to restart with a reset
2010-07-25T16:50:00.000Z	troubled		either ubuntu broke suspend on my machine during last updates or after being instructed to test the latest vanilla kernel (maverick). Any ideas if the kernel would cause any tools to update in a way that would break the system suspend?
2010-07-25T16:51:00.000Z	troubled		Linux compaq 2.6.18-bootsplash+ipset+u32+ipp2p+mms+sip-1 #1 Tue May 13 12:18:52 EDT 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
2010-07-25T16:51:00.000Z	troubled		oops, wrong machine, sec :)
2010-07-25T16:53:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	so don't use the maverick kernel?
2010-07-25T16:53:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	im not, but i did boot it once to test something. just putting it out there. I just pasting the `uname -a` of what i am actually runing now
2010-07-25T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	then don't say you're using it, that's confusing :)
2010-07-25T16:54:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	sorry, bad wording. Not "using", had "tried" it to test for a problem for a bug report.
2010-07-25T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	anyway, it shouldn't have affected anything else afaik
2010-07-25T16:55:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	thats what I am thinking. but its either that or the last update to the system from proposed. just here checking if anyone else might have noticed it
2010-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	what was your reasoning for testing the kernel?
2010-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	I was asked by a dev in a bug report
2010-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	right, but regarding what?
2010-07-25T17:00:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	a dvd problem. seems the latest kernel is fine with it
2010-07-25T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	ok, just figured maybe it was related
2010-07-25T17:01:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	nah. but as I was saying, this only happened the last 2 days, and the only thing that happened since was the .35 test and a package update
2010-07-25T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	do you know what packages were updated?
2010-07-25T17:02:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	not off hand. was some stuff from proposed and some stuff from security. i'd have to go through the logs
2010-07-25T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	hmm, proposed isn't really meant to be used as a an "always-on" repository
2010-07-25T17:03:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	ya, might just be the first time ive been bitten by having it on. i don't want to disable it now though in case I start getting missing dependancy issues
2010-07-25T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	you won't get missing dependency issues
2010-07-25T17:04:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	even if I remove something that was updated to a higher version than is stock and they depend on stuff that was from proposed or pulled in from it?
2010-07-25T17:05:00.000Z	jrib	troubled	you're removing things, dependencies aren't required to remove something and apt would tell you if other things depend on it
2010-07-25T17:05:00.000Z	troubled	jrib	well, guess ill disable it than, thanks
