2011-10-04T02:56:00.000Z	atdprhs		I need to clear my grub list on my ubuntu installed on the external hard drive
2011-10-04T02:57:00.000Z	atdprhs		because it shows the other operating systems on the internal hard drive
2011-10-04T02:58:00.000Z	atdprhs		I remember I knew there was a specific command for it on terminal, anyone can help?
2011-10-04T02:59:00.000Z	atdprhs		anyone knows how I can make my grub loader to show only OS installed on the hard drive not any other attached hard drive?
2011-10-04T03:00:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	usually external drives have a drive id like sda or sdb whereas your internal drives are named hda, hdb and hdc
2011-10-04T03:01:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	if youare new to this, why not remove external drives when you are naming partitions ?
2011-10-04T03:01:00.000Z	atdprhs		yes q0rs, but i want the grub loader on that external drive to only have the OS in it
2011-10-04T03:02:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	you can connect an external drive and see its name or drive id
2011-10-04T03:02:00.000Z	atdprhs		I installed ubuntu on that external hard drive and already using it now from that external hard drive
2011-10-04T03:03:00.000Z	atdprhs		but I don't want that ubuntu on that external hard drive to see other operating systems on the other machine
2011-10-04T03:03:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	do you want to install the bootloader on an external drive and os files on your internal hard drive?
2011-10-04T03:04:00.000Z	atdprhs		no
2011-10-04T03:04:00.000Z	atdprhs		when I installed ubuntu on that External HDD, it loaded and identified the other OS on the internal HDD
2011-10-04T03:05:00.000Z	atdprhs		my problem is that if I used that E. HDD on another computer, it will ask me to choose between the operating systems which are already not installed on that other machine
2011-10-04T03:05:00.000Z	atdprhs		So I don't need the other OS on that E. DHD
2011-10-04T03:05:00.000Z	atdprhs		HDD*
2011-10-04T03:06:00.000Z	atdprhs		noooo qin
2011-10-04T03:07:00.000Z	atdprhs		I remember I came here before for that problem and somebody gave me a command to fix it
2011-10-04T03:07:00.000Z	atdprhs		what I need is to remove the other links to the other operating systems on that grub loader on my external HDD
2011-10-04T03:08:00.000Z	atdprhs	g0rs	any idea?
2011-10-04T03:09:00.000Z	atdprhs		any help any one?
2011-10-04T03:10:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	it is a bit complicated, if i were you , i would read the manuals or tutorials on grub and linux before attempting it
2011-10-04T03:10:00.000Z	g0rs	atdprhs	i dont its details as of now, i have to look them up.
