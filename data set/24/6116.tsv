2006-01-22T12:24:00.000Z	emily		My system wont allow me to log in as any user in a graphical mode, it says that it cant get write access to the authorization file or out of space on home directory or out of disk space, whats the deal and how do i fix that?  I can log into a console
2006-01-22T12:26:00.000Z	emily		I really need to get into the system, I have a paper on the drive that I need to turn in today!!!
2006-01-22T12:27:00.000Z	_jason	emily	use a livecd to get your paper if you really need it.  Is it possible that you are actually out of space?
2006-01-22T12:28:00.000Z	emily	_jason	no chance out of space unless some hacked my box and or a other type problem vulnerability...
2006-01-22T12:28:00.000Z	_jason	emily	does it mention something like .Xauthority or .ICEauthority?
2006-01-22T12:28:00.000Z	emily	_jason	yes
2006-01-22T12:29:00.000Z	_jason	emily	delete those two files and try again
2006-01-22T12:29:00.000Z	emily	_jason	I will try, brb
2006-01-22T12:31:00.000Z	emily	_jason	that does not solve the problem
2006-01-22T12:31:00.000Z	emily	_jason	none of my users can log on graphically
2006-01-22T12:32:00.000Z	_jason	emily	good point
2006-01-22T12:32:00.000Z	_jason	emily	'df', does that say you have plenty of space left?
2006-01-22T12:33:00.000Z	emily	_jason	df reports 100% usage of my root directory
2006-01-22T12:34:00.000Z	emily	_jason	that would explain something, but what happened?
2006-01-22T12:34:00.000Z	_jason	emily	how big is your drive?
2006-01-22T12:34:00.000Z	emily	_jason	its a 120 gig drive, brand new system with nothing on it but a base ubuntu breezy install
2006-01-22T12:35:00.000Z	_jason	emily	try 'apt-get clean', to free up some space
2006-01-22T12:36:00.000Z	emily	_jason	what does that command do?
2006-01-22T12:37:00.000Z	_jason	emily	clean clears out  the  local  repository  of  retrieved  package files.
2006-01-22T12:38:00.000Z	_jason	emily	what files?
2006-01-22T12:38:00.000Z	_jason	emily	try those commands Ng and HappyFool mentioned to see what was using all the space
2006-01-22T12:43:00.000Z	_jason	emily	what command did you type exactly?  it should ahve said more
2006-01-22T13:02:00.000Z	_jason	emily	how much did the apt-get clean free up?
2006-02-19T08:18:00.000Z	_jason	emily	don't know anything about asterisk, sorry
