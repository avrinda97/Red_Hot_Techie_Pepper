2007-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss		does anyone know of a good WiFi connection manager?  I've tried WiFi radar, and it sucks
2007-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	network-manager-gnome
2007-03-27T12:43:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 I've tried that, and it's even worse.  it dosn't show the WiFi networks in range, and it sucks for connecting.
2007-03-27T12:44:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	I've had that problem before, to fix it I edited /etc/network/interfaces and commented out everything except the lo interface. then restarted the computer and it seemed to work then
2007-03-27T12:45:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 well, now, I can't even get my internal WiFi card to work.  it won't connect to ANYTHING!!!!  I've got to run on a 802.11B card and it's slow as hell
2007-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	hmm, what kind of wireless card is it?
2007-03-27T12:47:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 it's an Athoes card.  It worked before, but the system will lock up occasionaly, then for the next few reboots, it won't work.
2007-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	make sure restrited modules is installed for your kernel
2007-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 in the reposeritys?
2007-03-27T12:50:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	yup, in synaptic search for restricted modules and make sure that you have the one for your kernel installed, that *should* take care of it, if not I'm not quite sure than
2007-03-27T12:50:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 ok, I'll have a quick look
2007-03-27T12:51:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 it looks like they're installed
2007-03-27T12:52:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	does the computer recognize your wireless card?
2007-03-27T12:52:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 yes it does.  I can see it in iwconfig
2007-03-27T12:53:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	but it won't show any wireless networks available?
2007-03-27T12:53:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 well, if I type in the knowen network SSID, it won't connect to it.
2007-03-27T12:55:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 any other ideas?
2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	have you tried iwlist?
2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 yes
2007-03-27T12:56:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	did that show anything?
2007-03-27T12:57:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 yes, it shows the list of SSIDs.
2007-03-27T13:00:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	does the wireless network you are trying to connect to have WPA security on it?
2007-03-27T13:00:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	sidny4	 nope, totaly open network.  I tried it first with encryption, then I rolled it back to test it.
2007-03-27T13:01:00.000Z	sidny4	jeeves_Moss	have you tried configuring it in network-admin?
