2007-01-18T11:47:00.000Z	mzanfardino		unfortunately, it's time to reinstall as I've obliterated my X...
2007-01-18T11:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	You should never need to reinstall. What did you break? It should be easy to put X back.
2007-01-18T11:47:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	now you are talking arrenlex
2007-01-18T11:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	Well I knew it couldn't have been English.
2007-01-18T11:48:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	ok, in a work, nvidia. specifically, I attempted to install the latest video driver, only to discover that there is a problem between the driver loaded on my system and the image that boots...
2007-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	it turns out my experience with the ATI driver and config programs have been no help in upgrading an nvidia card/driver
2007-01-18T11:50:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	I downloaded the nvidia .run file and proceeded to upgrade the driver, but I have no idea how to check the config,,
2007-01-18T11:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	Any particular reason the drivers in the ubuntu repositories aren't good enough? Were you following the !nvidia guide\do you know about it?
2007-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	1) no paritcular reason, save I wanted the latest and greatest to see if I get better performance for WoW. 2) I am aware of the doc 3) I thought I was, but I may have missed something...
2007-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	Are you sure you were trying the nvidia driver? Or was it nv?
2007-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	let me check my xorg.conf
2007-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	I meant when you had poor performance.
2007-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	oh, let me check. I think it was nv
2007-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	There you go. nv doesn'ts support 3D acceleration at all.
2007-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	and as for now, my xorg is back to generic video and it still doesn't load
2007-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	ah...
2007-01-18T11:55:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	no, I stand corrected, I was using nvidia
2007-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	What would happen if you changed X to use the nvidia driver?
2007-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	That was "nv driver" and do what mister_roboto says first.
2007-01-18T12:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	mzanfardino	sudo update-grub
2007-01-18T12:06:00.000Z	mzanfardino	arrenlex	thank you. I"m off to rebott...
