2007-04-02T15:22:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	Sorry, I was disconnected for the last 3 minutes: What does it wait for since the last initrd update that came from edgy-security?
2007-04-02T15:22:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	sorry i didn't understand that question
2007-04-02T15:23:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	 it is always the number of ticks on the CPU's timestamp counter (or some multiple of it if not the exact counter).  it's an absolute value.  since the CPU started
2007-04-02T15:23:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	since the last reboot, rather i believe
2007-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	you have libdvdcss?
2007-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	Yes.
2007-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	it looks like a region problem, maybe
2007-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	(you know how DVDs have different regions)  that could be one reasons
2007-07-21T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	but it's probably a libdvdcss problem and i dont know how to fix that
2007-07-21T08:29:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	hmmm ... I can watch the menu and some not encrypted trailers. So I think it's no region problem. Is there a newer version of libdvdcss2 than I used?
2007-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	no idea.  which one did you use..?
2008-06-26T20:48:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	So, do you have any other solution than moving that partition to lower sectors?
2008-06-26T20:49:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	sorry i am not sure, but i did not se your error before.  now that i do see it, the bios may matter
2008-06-26T20:49:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	hmmm, ok.
2008-06-26T20:50:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	can you give me any more detalis on the circumstances and what may have caused the error?
2008-06-26T20:50:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	I created a new partition /dev/sda7. When I run `grub` from the cmd line, its tab completion shows me that new partition as (hd0,6). But when I reboot (hd0,6) can't be found. In edit mode the last available partition is (hd0,5). Any idea how to make grub re-read the partitions?
2008-06-26T20:52:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	odd.  you seem to be losing a partition, then?
2008-06-26T20:52:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	Yes, but I can access it w/o problems from runnning Ubuntu ...
2008-06-26T20:53:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	ya. grub might use bios to enumerate, and ubuntu may use the controller directly.  but that's a guess
2008-06-26T20:57:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	i'm not sure there's a more reliable way, but you could concoct some dd(disk druid) command to do it, maybe
2008-06-26T20:57:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	No, the smaller target will be a problem there. I'd have to shrink the fs first.
2008-06-26T20:58:00.000Z	vlt	xtknight	I was rather looing for tool that could do all that in one go.
2008-06-26T20:59:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	i don't believe there is any filesystem-independent tool that would do that, but the ext3 or xfs or whichever FS you use may have a tool to migrate a filesystem
2008-06-26T20:59:00.000Z	xtknight	vlt	if archiving the whole thing up ("imaging") it is easier you could do that like soundray suggested
