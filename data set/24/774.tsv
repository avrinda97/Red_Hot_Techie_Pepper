2011-08-08T13:35:00.000Z	anli_		My original problem is that I cannot use compiz together with blender actually
2011-08-08T13:35:00.000Z	anli_		It locks up the graphics after a while so I have to reboot
2011-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	anli_		nvidia 8600 GT
2011-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	anli_		hm, must check
2011-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	anli_		I have to use synaptic then, I suppose
2011-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	anli_		aha
2011-08-08T13:37:00.000Z	anli_		NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86 Kernel Module  270.41.06  Mon Apr 18 14:54:25 PDT 2011
2011-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	anli_		So why do I get that driver when I am running the newest version of ubuntu?
2011-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	anli_		But now its more than bad
2011-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	anli_		I cant submit bug reports here and where, I have a job to do
2011-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	no, it might not be a driver problem, this is just a guess for now, but probably a good one
2011-08-08T13:32:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	look what xev means
2011-08-08T13:32:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	do _not_ run a window manager with sudo
2011-08-08T13:33:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	this is plain nonsence and it might break things such as the access rights to .Xauthority
2011-08-08T13:33:00.000Z	anli_	Fuchs	If I dont use sudo, all that is happening is that I damage window titles and I have to restart the computer
2011-08-08T13:34:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	then your system is already rather broken
2011-08-08T13:34:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	of course not, since it takes the settings of the root user
2011-08-08T13:35:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	try fix the other problem first, by changing the wm-theme as an example. As your regular user, not with sudo.
2011-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	due to the update policy of ubuntu, which is not a bad thing, usually
2011-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	if the problem still persists, please create a nvidia bug report  (sudo nvidia-bug-report.sh), unzip it and put the contents (plain text file) in a pastebin service
2011-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	well, pity, then I can't help you, since I as well have a job to do and not time for more guesses
2011-08-08T13:40:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	creating a bug reports takes ~ 2 minutes, I guess you should have this time
2011-08-08T13:40:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	so: try the new driver, if it works: good. If it doesn't: create a bug report.
2011-08-08T13:41:00.000Z	Fuchs	anli_	but due to the fact that you have to run a window manager as root to have a working system, I suspect that there might be already something broken on your system.
