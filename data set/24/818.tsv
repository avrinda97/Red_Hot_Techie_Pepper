2011-10-03T20:05:00.000Z	BarkingFish		we saw you the first time, ardithoxha - and we're trying to help you. Please be patient with us :)
2011-10-03T20:06:00.000Z	BarkingFish		you need to reboot your machine, and when you start, before ubuntu loads, you will need to press whichever key your PC says for System Setup, it's usually Escape, F1 or F2
2011-10-03T20:07:00.000Z	BarkingFish		You just have to look for the right part of the BIOS where you enable and disable hardware, ardithoxha
2011-10-03T20:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I can't tell you where that is, all BIOS's are different
2011-10-03T20:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish		if you find your onboard sound disabled, enable it.
2011-10-03T20:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish		Yes
2011-10-03T20:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish		You have to check that the sound card is enabled in the BIOS
2011-10-03T20:09:00.000Z	BarkingFish		Do I have any contact with what, ardithoxha? :)
2011-10-03T20:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish		Here, you get it for free. Be happy :)
2011-10-03T20:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish		yes

2011-10-03T20:12:00.000Z	BarkingFish	sileni	Funny maybe, but true.  I do in home PC service, but I charge for it.  Usually about Â£20 an hour
2011-10-03T20:12:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	no ardithoxha is funny
2011-10-03T21:09:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	hey
2011-10-03T21:09:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	i would like your help
2011-10-03T21:10:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	what would be the best way to timestamp the replies from ping?
2011-10-03T21:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish	sileni	ping -t <location>
2011-10-03T21:11:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	doesn't work
2011-10-03T21:11:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	the -T is the option for timestamp but for some reaon when i do ping -T tsonly <location>
2011-10-03T21:11:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	it doesn't ping
2011-10-03T21:11:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	just sits there
2011-10-03T21:11:00.000Z	BarkingFish	sileni	are you behind a firewall preventing incoming icmp?
2011-10-03T21:12:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	hmm shouldn't be, cause i can ping it normally with `ping <location>`
2011-10-03T21:12:00.000Z	sileni	BarkingFish	and i can get the replies if i do that
