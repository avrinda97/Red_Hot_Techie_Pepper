2010-06-30T20:48:00.000Z	xray_tsk		I guess it's better to download package from virtualbox site
2010-06-30T20:48:00.000Z	xray_tsk		It installs without problems...
2010-06-30T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	so does the one from repo
2010-06-30T20:53:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	the version on the site is newer...
2010-06-30T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	so what
2010-06-30T20:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	slightly or even rather old versions of Virtualbox, are fine for most of us
2010-06-30T20:55:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	sure, suitable. I prefer newer version, you prefer repository version. Eny solution has some pluses.
2010-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	anyway, installation from official site is simple too.
2010-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	well if you want newer stuff,  Ubuntu isn't exactly the right distro,  its always a few months behind when a new version comes out
2010-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	ubuntu is the right version.
2010-06-30T20:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	most of the packages aren't at their latest stable version, when a version of Ubuntu comes out, thats what I am saying
2010-06-30T20:57:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	But I prefer newer version of some few software.
2010-06-30T20:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	also new versions of most Linux software, offers little advantage, over slightly older versions
2010-06-30T20:58:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	actually those, that I can download and install from site. Such as vbox, flash, skype and others.
2010-06-30T20:59:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	slightly?..
2010-06-30T20:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	yeah so like Gnome 2.28 for example instead of Gnome 2.30
2010-06-30T20:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	with Gnome 2.29 being a development version.  anyway we are a bit off topic here
2010-06-30T20:59:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	vbox 3.1.6 instead of 3.2.6 is not slightly ;)
2010-06-30T21:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	the vbox I have instaled at the moment is quite old really, but fine for now,  I can do vm's in it so yeah :) anyway its probably nearly time for me to upgrade my distro to a later version
2010-06-30T21:03:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	:) anyway I didn't mean that the site's version is only right. I just know, that vbox in repo is allways too old. Just prefer it from site :)
2010-06-30T21:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	vbox from Ubuntu's repo is only open source version as well, so no USB support
2010-06-30T21:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	unlike the other
2010-06-30T21:04:00.000Z	xray_tsk	sebsebseb	I don't mind of proprietary software, if it's free %)
2010-06-30T21:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xray_tsk	and good  and works natively on a Linux distro,  :)  if only for WIndows :(
