2005-08-04T09:44:00.000Z	cs378		lol
2005-08-04T07:56:00.000Z	cs378		only one application can access the sound card at once, how can i set it so multiple app can access the sound card?
2005-08-04T07:56:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	this is why 'esd' runs in the background - it multiplexes sound output from many apps to the one card.
2005-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	I assume you're running Gnome?
2005-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	yes im running gnome
2005-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	which apps in particular?
2005-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	most Gnome apps should work OK with esd.
2005-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	like if i run real player n xmms, while real is play xmms cant
2005-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	how do i install esd
2005-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	should be running by default when you log in.
2005-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	type 'ps -A | grep esd' to see if esd is running.
2005-08-04T08:00:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	got this:   8334 ?        00:00:00 esd
2005-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	ok, so it's running for you.
2005-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	you need to see if realplayer can use 'esd' as it's output.
2005-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	although I doubt it understands about esd...
2005-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	xmms does understand about esd though.
2005-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	how i do check for esd
2005-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	cs378	rkinder	in real
2005-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	one sec - let me install it.
2005-08-04T08:06:00.000Z	rkinder	cs378	output is 'eSound Output Plugin'
