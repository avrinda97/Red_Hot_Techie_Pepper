2009-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	jhb1608		can I do both?
2009-11-05T05:39:00.000Z	jhb1608		can I backup in both places?
2009-11-05T05:39:00.000Z	jhb1608		ok
2009-11-05T05:40:00.000Z	jhb1608		this chatroom is faster than the forum
2009-11-05T05:40:00.000Z	jhb1608		I waited 3 days have no response, but here is like 5 minute response
2009-11-05T05:40:00.000Z	jhb1608		it is easier in here
2009-11-05T05:41:00.000Z	jhb1608		oh should I do the sudo command when copying a backup?
2009-11-05T05:42:00.000Z	jhb1608		should I do sudo on this command: "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /home/foousernamehere/"?
2009-11-05T05:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	No
2009-11-05T06:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Upstream X did that
2009-11-05T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Why do you want an Xorg.conf?
2009-11-05T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	You don't need an xorg.conf
2009-11-05T06:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	The "backup" is no xorg.conf, that's what is working now and that is what will work again after you remove the nvidia drivers and card
2009-11-05T06:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	By the way, you should use System > Administration > Hardware Drivers to install your nvida drivers
2009-11-05T06:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Again, if anything goes wrong, uninstall the nvidia package and delete your xorg.conf
2009-11-05T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	*Crazy XOrg developers
2009-11-05T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	All distros are moving this way
2009-11-05T06:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	I never said that, I said if anything goes wrong remove the ncidia-glx package and delete your xorg.conf
2009-11-05T06:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Installing the nvidia drivers will create one
2009-11-05T06:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Because it needs to specify the nvidia driver
2009-11-05T06:36:00.000Z	jhb1608	Jordan_U	 will it detect the specific correct nvidia driver?
2009-11-05T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jhb1608	Yes, only one version can be installed at a time and Hardware Drivers chooses the right one
