2012-06-24T07:16:00.000Z	Jagst3r15		do i need an antivirus for ubuntu guys?
2012-06-24T07:16:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	short answer: no
2012-06-24T07:17:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	but don't go around the web downloading and running random programs (especially closed sourced ones)
2012-06-24T07:17:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	they're all stable enough to use in my opinion
2012-06-24T07:18:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	you already have linux installed?  Is there any hardware not working? (e.g. wifi)
2012-06-24T07:20:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	what about your touchpad specifically is not working?
2012-06-24T07:21:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	I think there is special settings for multi-touch features if you look at the mouse / trackpad settings.  Have you done that yet?
2012-06-24T07:22:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	I'm not an ubuntu machine right now.  Open the dash and search for mouse, or search for trackpad.
2012-06-24T07:23:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	it should be straightforward
2012-06-24T07:25:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	did you find the gui setting?  What is making you say that?
2012-06-24T07:25:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	likely there is only one driver in the linux world fyi
2012-06-24T07:26:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	such as?  Do you have a setting that is enabled but isn't working?
2012-06-24T07:26:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	yes, of course.  But that doesn't answer my question.
2012-06-24T07:26:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	but the setting for that feature is enabled in the settings gui?
2012-06-24T07:27:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	yes... mmm
2012-06-24T07:29:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	deadmund	this maybe? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticsTouchpad
2012-06-24T07:29:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	this article is extremely related. Follow it closely
2012-06-24T07:30:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	deadmund	yes i see it says for 10.4 and earlier there are issues
2012-06-24T07:30:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	yep.
2012-06-24T07:31:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	deadmund	thanks for the help :)
2012-06-24T07:31:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	for 10.04 there is a different guide
2012-10-23T21:32:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	there is a system called 'ubuntu ideas'
2012-10-23T21:32:00.000Z	deadmund	Jagst3r15	what is your idea?
