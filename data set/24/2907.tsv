2009-10-12T06:17:00.000Z	sargento		Is there any visual way to mount a hard drive at startup?
2009-10-12T06:17:00.000Z	sargento		Some applications
2009-10-12T06:19:00.000Z	sargento		So when I tried to added it to fstab I got an error on the line I added
2009-10-12T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 change the filesystem label..  perhaps?
2009-10-12T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 or use UUID in fstab.
2009-10-12T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 if its internal you could proberly use /dev/sd## instead of uuid. but its best to learn how touse the UUID
2009-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 its a good idea to NEVER use spaces in volume labels for just that reason
2009-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 you could also make a nicer named soft link to the name with spaces in it. (but thats still annoying)
2009-10-12T06:32:00.000Z	sargento	Dr_Willis	That's because I used this hard drive when I used Windows, like 1 year ago
2009-10-12T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 if its a windows filesystem. I forget the commands to change its label. Gparted May be able to do it - if you have the extra ntfsprogs installed.
2009-10-12T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	  You got the UUID and Mountpoint parts merged..     ya need a space befoor  /media
2009-10-12T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 and the  /sragento \vol \whatever can be whatever you want. as long as the directory exiusts
2009-10-12T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 If you do a 'sudo mkdir /media/SargentoVol2  ' You can mount it there. No spaces needed.
2009-10-12T06:54:00.000Z	sargento	Dr_Willis	The problem is that I've been using Linux for 1 year and all my programs are configured to this path /media/Sargento Vol 2 because I can mount it from Places and loads automatically there.
2009-10-12T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	  using spaces in fstab is a pain. I recall how to do it once.. but i forget. it was more complex thenjust escaping with \
2009-10-12T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 you could LINK /media/silly name with spaces'   to /media/namewithnospaces   as a work around also
2009-10-12T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 i recall having to use '002' instead of spaces in fstab befor. (i dont recall where/how i learned that)
2009-10-12T06:57:00.000Z	sargento	Dr_Willis	thanks, let me search that info on Internet (about 002). Can I create a simbolic link to mount my hard drive at startup?
2009-10-12T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 at startup => is read from fstab -
2009-10-12T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 make a link from whever ya want to the mountpoint thats used in fstab
2009-10-12T06:59:00.000Z	sargento	Dr_Willis	Can I create the link between /media/sdb1 to /media/Sargento Vol 2?
2009-10-12T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	  Yes. i said so earlier....
2009-10-12T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sargento	 you could LINK /media/silly name with spaces'   to /media/namewithnospaces   as a work around also
2009-10-12T07:00:00.000Z	sargento	Dr_Willis	thank you.
