2006-09-11T10:36:00.000Z	vincenz		Hmm, is there any work on other support mechanisms than IRC?  I think that as the number of users grow, IRC becomes unmanageable (text goes by too fast)
2006-09-11T10:37:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	With a good client, and people using your name to address you, you can have message hilights that make it easy for you to keep up with.  Forums/message boards and email lists probably also exist.
2006-09-11T10:38:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	oh I know, but if you're not someone being helped but someone helping... I use irrsi personally and that works great :)
2006-09-11T10:39:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	irssi for me also.  :)
2006-09-11T10:39:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	Screen + irssi on a home server works great.  :)
2006-09-11T10:39:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	I wish it were able to pass over an http proxy, at work we have an http proxy so I have to use GAIM :/
2006-09-11T10:39:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	definitely :)
2006-09-11T10:40:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	If you have a home linux server, why not use ssh forwarding?  Or use irssi and bitlbee?
2006-09-11T10:40:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	well I typically turn my linux server off as of late cause my CPU fan makes a s*tload of noise, besides I have my own laptop which  I shuttle back and forth to the office,
2006-09-11T10:41:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	but I'll look into bitlbee
2006-09-11T10:42:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	oh, no I think you misunderstood me.  Ihave to use GAIM to contact IRC because GAIM has the http-proxy possibility, irssi does not, or at least I haven't figured out how to set it up.  I know it is strange, but all our traffic goes over that proxy, we even have a perl script to tunnel ssh over it
2006-09-11T10:42:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	It is pretty cool.  You connect to it as if it's an irc server, and it gateways AIM, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, Jabber, and I think others.
2006-09-11T10:43:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	SOCKS4, SOCKS5?
2006-09-11T10:43:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	HTTP
2006-09-11T10:43:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	That's the option that works at least.  that's also why GAIM works and amsn doesnt
2006-09-11T10:44:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	Hmmm, googled, doesn't seem like it will do that.
2006-09-11T10:45:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	anyways, bitlbee looks nonetheless like a neat app :)
2006-09-11T10:48:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	so you're part of the ubuntu community?
2006-09-11T10:53:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	gnaff: something interesting: http://www.garion.org/irssi/irssi-proxy.php
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	You can do pretty much the same with screen+irssi.
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	oh I know, jsut sounded technically nifty :)
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	hehe.
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	vincenz	kaitlyn	and he points out a reason not to use screen :P
2006-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	kaitlyn	vincenz	I don't lag when typing.  :)
