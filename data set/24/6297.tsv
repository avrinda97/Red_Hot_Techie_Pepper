2010-01-27T23:56:00.000Z	maco	oskude	actually you can shebang later in the file too
2010-01-27T23:56:00.000Z	maco	oskude	! is bang :)
2010-01-27T23:57:00.000Z	maco	oskude	you can have #! /bin/bash { 30 lines of bash stuff } #! /usr/bin/perl {30 lines of perl stuff}
2010-01-27T23:57:00.000Z	oskude	maco	aah. but of course!
2010-01-27T23:57:00.000Z	oskude	maco	ahaa. thanks!
2010-01-27T23:58:00.000Z	oskude	maco	well, "shebang" (for foreigns like me) sounds like "bang her" :/
2010-01-27T23:59:00.000Z	maco	oskude	 O_o
2010-01-28T00:02:00.000Z	maco	oskude	psst "interpreter"
2010-01-28T00:03:00.000Z	oskude	maco	yup. but i dont know if that would confuse more. and after all it is "just" a program
2010-01-28T00:13:00.000Z	oskude	maco	got an example for multiple shabangs in a script ?
2010-01-28T00:13:00.000Z	maco	oskude	no, i think i saw it in either the tldp advanced bash guide or in a python book
2010-01-28T00:15:00.000Z	oskude	maco	nibbler, hmm... i cant get multiple shabangs to work neither...
2010-01-28T00:17:00.000Z	maco	oskude	hmm yeah i just tried and it didnt work...lemme look around...
2010-01-28T00:17:00.000Z	oskude	maco	nibbler, but for the sanity, lets just use one file per code :) (we dont even do html/js/css in one file do we ;P)
2010-01-28T00:30:00.000Z	maco	oskude	but it wont be binary compatible, will it?
2010-01-28T00:31:00.000Z	oskude	maco	no idea. just i thought i read it somewhere...
2010-01-28T00:32:00.000Z	maco	oskude	i know mono stuff ends in .exe, but i didnt think the same .exe would run on both mono and windows
2010-01-28T00:32:00.000Z	maco	oskude	i thought itd need to be recompiled. but ive never tried it, so maybe... just wouldnt bet on it
2010-01-28T00:33:00.000Z	oskude	maco	well, if it's so. then it sounds like not good as java ;P
2010-01-28T00:33:00.000Z	maco	oskude	java runs in a virtual machine, just like python
2010-01-28T00:33:00.000Z	maco	oskude	there's an extra layer of magic.  whereas a .exe is a native windows binary. there's not a virtual machine there
2010-01-28T00:33:00.000Z	oskude	maco	koe http://www.mono-project.com/Cross-compiling_Mono_for_Windows
2010-01-28T00:34:00.000Z	oskude	maco	well, atleast for mono. but why not for mono apps too ?
2010-01-28T00:34:00.000Z	maco	oskude	also...java: write once, debug everywhere ;)
