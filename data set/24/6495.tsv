2008-09-09T20:34:00.000Z	user__		I want help in disabling terminal
2008-09-09T20:35:00.000Z	soundray	user__	can you explain a bit more?
2008-09-09T20:35:00.000Z	soundray	user__	can you explain a bit more?
2008-09-14T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	user__	this channel is not for surveys. If you have a problem, describe it.
2008-09-14T22:50:00.000Z	soundray	user__	don't be shy to ask specific questions, but please no "anyone" questions
2008-09-14T22:55:00.000Z	soundray	user__	no swearing please. And any flooding will result in an immediate ban
2008-11-17T19:36:00.000Z	soundray	user__	you should check your BIOS setup first and make sure the hard disks are set to Mode: Auto
2008-11-17T19:37:00.000Z	user__	soundray	they are. problem is that  i think my hdd has a broken master boot record...
2008-11-17T19:37:00.000Z	soundray	user__	installing grub fixes the master boot record
2008-11-17T19:38:00.000Z	soundray	user__	try the RestoreGrub instructions ^^
2008-11-17T19:42:00.000Z	soundray	user__	use a comma, not a period (hd0,0)
2008-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	soundray	user__	have you really entered 'setup (hd0)' only? No leading spaces and such?
2008-11-17T19:47:00.000Z	soundray	user__	please try again
2008-11-17T19:50:00.000Z	soundray	user__	now you should compare the output from 'sudo fdisk -l' and the partition references in /boot/grub/menu.lst to see if the latter refer to the correct partitions.
2008-11-17T19:53:00.000Z	soundray	user__	so that refers to the first partition on your first hard disk. Is that your Ubuntu root?
2008-11-17T19:55:00.000Z	soundray	user__	have you got more than one hard disk drive?
2008-11-17T19:56:00.000Z	soundray	user__	no, that's not going to work
2008-11-17T19:57:00.000Z	soundray	user__	yes, I can't see anything wrong with that. Don't know why you're still getting an error 17
2008-11-17T19:58:00.000Z	soundray	user__	unless your BIOS somehow detects it wrong
2008-11-17T19:59:00.000Z	soundray	user__	yes. Try the other settings. LBA should work with most large disks
2008-11-17T19:59:00.000Z	soundray	user__	LBA
2008-11-17T20:00:00.000Z	soundray	user__	set Mode: LBA instead of Mode: Auto in BIOS
