2006-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	it all depends on how much you play with the cli among other things with how fast you learn linux
2006-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	hybrid i'm eager and learning everyday, but i'm afraid to kick bill to the curb.
2006-08-28T07:39:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	I have but I till need to use it lol
2006-08-28T07:46:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	wine has a lot of support now for many applications
2006-08-28T07:46:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	true
2006-08-28T07:48:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	what's the printer?
2006-08-28T07:49:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	it's a challenge. lexmark z603. i know i saw the wiki even some experts helped me install cups and all the 9 yards. it printed but not from printer
2006-08-28T08:25:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	learning the commands isn't really htat hard just take your time :)
2006-08-28T08:26:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	u know, thats why i'm slowly coming back because of the love in this room........
2006-08-28T08:28:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	my first distro was slackware really so my experience is probably much higher then most, I m at the point where I can probably build my own system
2006-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	ladydoor i have 1 hd partitioned  window xp  /   breezy / dapper  strange huh?
2006-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	umm that sounds to me like a broken but then again you probably have more then one partition
2006-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	sorry
2006-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	i mean 1 hd 3 partitions
2006-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	that's sounds right
2006-08-28T08:31:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	i bounce back and forth from breezy to dapper and i see dapper is a little bit smoother but my avi and mpeg movies aren't producing sound and skips .. all kinda stuff.
2006-08-28T08:32:00.000Z	kitche	wd3	well that might be an issue with the codecs
2006-08-28T08:32:00.000Z	wd3	kitche	i was thinking the same thing.. that's why i asked about easyubuntu for dapper .
