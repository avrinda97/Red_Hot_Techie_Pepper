2008-11-01T05:43:00.000Z	secret901		Visual effects stopped working for me after I upgraded to 8.10 even though it's worked in 8.04
2008-11-01T05:44:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	you mean Compiz?
2008-11-01T05:44:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	I think so, it comes default with 8.10 right?
2008-11-01T05:44:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	yeah, it's compiz.  It's worked in 8.04
2008-11-01T05:45:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	you should be able to get it in the Add/Remove under Applications.
2008-11-01T05:45:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	it's there, but when I try to enable it, it just thinks that my card can't handle it
2008-11-01T05:46:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	what card
2008-11-01T05:46:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	it's an intel card
2008-11-01T05:47:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	which intel card?
2008-11-01T05:47:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	 Intel Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller
2008-11-01T05:47:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	could have something to do with your resolution. what is that set at?
2008-11-01T05:47:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	I'm sure it's not because of a non-supported driver. This is a Dell Ubuntu laptop and it works fine if I use the live CD
2008-11-01T05:48:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	right now it's 1280x800
2008-11-01T05:48:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	let me look around for a bit
2008-11-01T05:52:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	are you using an attached monitor?
2008-11-01T05:53:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	no, I'm using a laptop.
2008-11-01T05:54:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	this new version allows me to also output to TV if I connect the S-video port
2008-11-01T06:02:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	ok
2008-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	everything I am finding points to a possible driver bug, but I don't have much more detail than that. Still looking...
2008-11-01T06:23:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	any luck?
2008-11-01T06:23:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	not yet, everything has been coming to a dead end
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	most of the linked bugs I am finding seem to point to driver issues, but when I start heading that way the related bugs are due to some external monitor
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	secret901	JFo	I think it's some botched configuration, since it works fine in the LiveCD
2008-11-01T06:24:00.000Z	JFo	secret901	I really think so too
