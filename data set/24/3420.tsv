2008-02-29T06:55:00.000Z	rycole		hey guys, i just installed ubuntu, and i am trying to install xchat via the "Add/Remove" dialog. when i click the check mark for xchat, it tells me the list of applications is not available, and to click refresh. when i click refresh it seems to download a list (it says "download file 6 of 6") and then processes it, it looks like
2008-02-29T06:55:00.000Z	rycole		but it does this every time i click the x next to xchat
2008-02-29T06:55:00.000Z	rycole		any ideaS?
2008-02-29T06:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	just open a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install xchat"
2008-02-29T06:57:00.000Z	rycole	IndyGunFreak	i tried that as well, and it says there's no xchat package. i even tried apt-get update, and it doesn't seem to download anything new.
2008-02-29T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	hav eyou modified your source list?
2008-02-29T06:58:00.000Z	rycole	IndyGunFreak	nope
2008-02-29T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	maybe.
2008-02-29T06:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	open synaptic package manager.. system/admin/synaptic
2008-02-29T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	were you able to install from there
2008-02-29T07:01:00.000Z	rycole	IndyGunFreak	i don't see an xchat package in this. it looks like a different package manager?
2008-02-29T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	click settings/repositories
2008-02-29T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	thats fine, are all the boxes checked? on the top under "download from the internet"
2008-02-29T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	thus the problem,check them all
2008-02-29T07:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	after checking them all, apply changes, then in synaptic, click "reload"
2008-02-29T07:04:00.000Z	rycole	IndyGunFreak	ok, this seems to be working. it's downloading about 45 files.
2008-02-29T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rycole	right, now, you can either search synaptic for xchat, and install it, or go to add/remove, or in a terminal, sudo apt-get install xchat
