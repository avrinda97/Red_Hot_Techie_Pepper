2005-05-06T10:27:00.000Z	x2comp		can someone tell me how to get into the su?
2005-05-06T10:28:00.000Z	x2comp		thanks
2005-05-06T10:28:00.000Z	x2comp		i couldn't figure it out because in Fedora, it was su
2005-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	x2comp		also, what is the editor?
2005-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	x2comp		i need to get into grub
2005-05-06T10:31:00.000Z	x2comp		i tried emacs, no luck
2005-05-06T10:32:00.000Z	x2comp		i need to edit grub.conf to change the default boot OS to Windows XP, but I can't seem to get into grub.conf to change it
2005-05-06T10:33:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	once you get grub.conf in the editor, change the "default 0" line to "default 4" , save the file and then reboot.
2005-05-06T10:39:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	how do i get emacs on here?
2005-05-06T10:40:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	try "sudo apt-get install emacs21*"
2005-05-06T10:43:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	thanks, that is the one text editor i know how to use
2005-05-06T10:44:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	i couldn't find grub.conf, it was menu.lst
2005-05-06T10:45:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	gack. you're right. sorry. recent convert from Fedora here.
2005-05-06T10:45:00.000Z	x2comp		does anyone know if i can install certain windows programs?
2005-05-06T10:46:00.000Z	x2comp		same, just wiped out fedora to install ubuntu
2005-05-06T10:46:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	i was tired of the bulk and frenetic pace of fedora.
2005-05-06T10:47:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	so i put ubuntu on an old 4 gig drive and started installing to taste.
2005-05-06T10:47:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	still have 25% of the drive left.
2005-05-06T10:47:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	i was a total noob and just felt that fedora was too slow, and it needed too many updates. Ubuntu seems to be faster and less needy :)
2005-05-06T10:49:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	i had just bought a 160gb hdd, and had my old 40gb lying around with no use so I installed linux onto it
2005-05-06T10:49:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	I like the ease of use of linux, but what is the advantage over windows?
2005-05-06T10:49:00.000Z	jb_one	x2comp	just keep using linux for a while and that question will be answered for you.
2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	except for no viruses, no spyware, no major bugs
2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	x2comp	jb_one	what else is there?
