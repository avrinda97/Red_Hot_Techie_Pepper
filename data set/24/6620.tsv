2005-10-16T11:21:00.000Z	misterdiff		hi all. i've got an amd x2 3800+ processor and am having trouble installing ubuntu on it
2005-10-16T11:22:00.000Z	misterdiff		i've tried to install but in the part where it gets to pick out the proper kernel it gives me an error that says and can't find a suitable kernel for the processor
2005-10-16T11:22:00.000Z	misterdiff		i can't even boot with a live distro
2005-10-16T11:23:00.000Z	misterdiff		i've tried i386, and amd 64
2005-10-16T11:23:00.000Z	wabble	misterdiff	you got two 3800+?
2005-10-16T11:23:00.000Z	misterdiff	wabble	yeha

2005-10-16T11:28:00.000Z	wabble	misterdiff	i'm sorry i dont know anything about the dual cores, have you tried a boot from knoppix to see if that works?
2005-10-16T11:29:00.000Z	misterdiff	wabble	no. i'm affraid i'll just keep wasting cds. i've already wasted 5 trying to get a live distro to work. don't wanna keep that up you know
