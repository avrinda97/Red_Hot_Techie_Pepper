2008-05-16T02:44:00.000Z	douye		What is the command to show new usb connections? (i thought it was something like.. tail -0f .. ?)
2008-05-16T02:44:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	would the command "dmesg" help?
2008-05-16T02:45:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	well i kinda wanna see it register devices when i plug them in
2008-05-16T02:46:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	dmesg gives timestamps... I don't know of anything that observes it live.
2008-05-16T02:46:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	there is, its something with tail -0f /var/... or something
2008-05-16T02:53:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	the command was "tail -f /var/log/messages"
2008-05-16T03:55:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	start using synaptic..
2008-05-16T03:55:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	why would I want to start using synaptic?
2008-05-16T03:55:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	easier to get to the thing you need when you dont know the complete name..
2008-05-16T03:56:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	I don't really think so. I find synaptic confusing. I really prefer the terminal.
2008-05-16T03:56:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	start synaptic, press search, type ubuntu, scroll all the way down and you will find the thing you're looking for..
2008-05-16T03:58:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	btw i dont have that package installed (the ubuntu-restricted-extras) and i can play .mp3 files with rythmbox so its not that
2008-05-16T03:58:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	it's not as simple as that....
2008-05-16T04:03:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	hmm some guy also had the problem and this fixed it for him "i found a solution for this problem. You have to change the output plugin in gstreamer-properties to OSS. It seems to be a problem of alsa or the alsa plugin of gstreamer."
2008-05-16T04:04:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	link?
2008-05-16T04:04:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=188956
2008-05-16T04:06:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	that problem is not at all like mine.
2008-05-16T04:06:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	nm.
2008-05-16T04:06:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	part of it is.., anyhow others fixed it by installing "gstreamer0.10-plugins" but you already done that right ?
2008-05-16T04:08:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	heh search for it in synaptic :P but sec i'll try to find the right apt-get command to test it
2008-05-16T04:09:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	I wanted the command that tells you the version, it has slipped my mind. :\
2008-05-16T04:09:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	the svn thingy ?
2008-05-16T04:10:00.000Z	thisusernamewasm	douye	that doesn't ring a bell, but maybe?
2008-05-16T04:14:00.000Z	douye	thisusernamewasm	its easier to check what you have installed with synaptic so far i know.. just search for "gstreamer0.10-plugins" and you can see what you got installed
