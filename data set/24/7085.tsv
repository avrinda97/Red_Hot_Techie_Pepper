2005-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	fazer		thanks
2005-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	its so you have a way to boot in and fix things at the lowest leve
2005-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	so I guess I can't follow that tutorial when I am in a GUI interfae?
2005-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	why 'all the time'
2005-04-30T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	too lazy to go to single user, and I have nothing thrashing my disk :)
2005-04-30T07:03:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	ah, heh
2005-04-30T07:04:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	how safe is using hdparm?
2005-04-30T07:04:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	all the dangerous stuff is identified in the man page
2005-04-30T07:05:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	-d -m and -c are all you probably care about
2005-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	hmm, -d -m and -c can't really mess up your hard drive then I guess?
2005-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	mine still work :)
2005-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	heh, its mainly because I am in an old laptop that I still love so taking all the precautions I can =/
2005-04-30T07:07:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	this is my only machine, I take verrry few chances
2005-04-30T07:07:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	ah okay =)
2005-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	when do these changes take affect?
2005-04-30T07:13:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	strange, I don't notice much =/
2005-04-30T07:14:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	I just did this: hdparm -c3 -m16 /dev/hda
2005-04-30T07:15:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	the recent kernels are a lot better at recognizing and optomizing disks these days, sometimes it gets it right.
2005-04-30T07:15:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	oh =/
2005-04-30T07:16:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	thanks
2005-04-30T07:17:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	so I am guessing that these settings are lost after reboot?
2005-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	nickrud	fazer	yes, you can edit /etc/default/hdparm.conf to make them applied at each boot
2005-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	fazer	nickrud	ah, i see.
