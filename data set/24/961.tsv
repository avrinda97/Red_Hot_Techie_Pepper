2010-10-04T16:21:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	you use that to control what scripts start and stop when the computer boots.

2010-10-04T16:22:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	yo0u can start he script manually if you don't want to reboot
2010-10-04T16:22:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	how can i do that?
2010-10-04T16:22:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	sudo /etc/init.d/scriptname start stop whatever
2010-10-04T16:26:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	i run /etc/init.d/scriptname, then run ps -aux |grep scriptname and this is result:
2010-10-04T16:26:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	is that ok?
2010-10-04T16:27:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	i wrote that script for shutdown server when power outage
2010-10-04T16:27:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	looks like its running then
2010-10-04T16:27:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	thanks :D
2010-10-04T16:27:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	pull the plug and see
2010-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	i setup connection for Mac user to connect to the server via smb://
2010-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	but he cannot modify some directory
2010-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	then you need to give him write access to the share in the smb.conf
2010-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	so how can i config permission for that user on the server?
2010-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	that page will explain the share needs to be writeable.
2010-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	thanks :)
2010-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	zipp0	histo	i write in smb.conf http://pastie.org/1214617 . Please tell me is that right?
2010-10-12T09:43:00.000Z	histo	zipp0	yeah but it looks like its commented out with #
