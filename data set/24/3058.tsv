2008-05-18T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	You've been here ofr less than 15 minutes.  Not everyone is awake/active all the time.  Repeat your question every 15-20-30 minutes, and you'll get an answer soon enough
2008-05-30T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	What do you mean?
2008-05-30T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiGuide
2008-05-30T06:19:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	You want to create your own page, right? or just edit one?
2008-05-30T06:21:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	Alright, just browse to the page you want to create (help.ubuntu.com/community/WhateverYouWantYourPageNameToBe) and there'll be a "this page does not exist, do you want to create one?" link.  Um, I think there are page naming guidelines, let me look for that link.
2008-05-30T06:22:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiGuide/PageCreation  gives some guidelines (and instructions, and some help on making stuff quicker, re: templates etc)
2008-05-30T06:22:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	They say that, read the second to the last paragraph of that page ;)
2008-05-30T06:28:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	No, it's just wiki...code or whatever you want to call it.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HelpOnEditing
2008-05-30T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	leave a blank line in between paragraphs, and use [[BR]] to insert a carriage return.  But we're getting offtopic, You mind taking it to #ubuntu-offtopic? or even #ubuntu-doc, either of those would be more appropriate than here.
2008-06-08T01:00:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	There is a server edition, yes
2008-06-08T01:02:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	Suggest using the alternate CD to install a command line version, then installing the servers on that.
2008-06-08T01:02:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	You probably won't want to use the server kernel, and I don't believe the server CD has either of those as preconfigured anyway
2008-06-08T01:06:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	You can install a super lightweight window manager on it (fluxbox, icewm, whatever)
2008-11-10T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	sudo caches the password for a time, you can either reduce (or eliminate) that time, or use sudo -k
2008-11-10T10:19:00.000Z	tj83	Flannel	TY, i will try -k as i dont want this to be system wide.
2008-11-10T10:23:00.000Z	tj83	Flannel	i added the -k option in my launcher line as gksu -k gedit filename.. but it does not ask for password every time.
2008-11-10T10:24:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	No, no, "sudo -k" will reset the timestamp (I'm actually not sure how this works with gksu).  See the gksu manpage to see if it supports the -k option, if not, try making your launcher do this instead: sudo -k; gksu whatever
2008-11-10T10:24:00.000Z	tj83	Flannel	ok, will try that.
2009-01-12T04:02:00.000Z	Flannel	tj83	Kino or cinelerra are the two standard movie things
