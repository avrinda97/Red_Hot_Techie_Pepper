2009-02-11T07:20:00.000Z	jillian		hi all...i'm having a problem..i upgraded to 8.10 yesterday and i don't know if it's related but my frostwire and other programs are unstable now.. when i try to load my frostwire only a blank screen loads.
2009-02-11T07:21:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 for frostwire you could try installing an updated version from getdeb.net
2009-02-11T07:21:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 for programs like that are not OS dependent -- you should download and install the new one for the new os
2009-02-11T07:22:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 new os -- new set of rules--
2009-02-11T07:23:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 the only thing the upgrade did was update system files not programs that were compiled to run with the old os-- a newer version should  make it run .
2009-02-11T07:23:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 though I would go into synaptic package manager and remove the old frostwire before installing the new
2009-02-11T07:25:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 once you remove the old here is a link to the new http://www.getdeb.net/app/Frostwire
2009-02-11T07:29:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 go with the new version
2009-02-11T07:32:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 I think I may know why your tops disappeared -- goto system- preference- appearance - then visual effects-- and select none
2009-02-11T07:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 it is probably a video driver update -- to fix that one-- but that is a fix for now.
2009-02-11T07:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 see if your frostwire is listed -- in your synaptic package manger--
2009-02-11T07:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 it would have been under installed -- on the left
2009-02-11T07:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 click the word installed
2009-02-11T07:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 then move the bar up and down on the right to see more packages
2009-02-11T07:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 I think when you tried to remove it-- some of your incomplete downloads possibly could not be removed
2009-02-11T07:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 other than before you install -- use nautilus then find the .frostwire folder and delete that  ( you would have to show hidden)
2009-02-11T07:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 lets not worry about that-- the new should see the old
2009-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 lets try that first
2009-02-11T07:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 for your reference-- type nautilus at the prompt and that is the file manger
2009-02-11T07:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 for the default install of Ubuntu (unless you have Xubuntu/Kubuntu or many varients)
2009-02-11T07:48:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 yes I just got back
2009-02-11T07:49:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 pm?
2009-02-11T07:49:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	 you should see a tab appear with my name
2009-02-11T07:50:00.000Z	redvamp128	jillian	click it
