2010-02-25T22:38:00.000Z	esicam		I installed ubuntu 9.10 on my dell laptop and while starting the computer, it shows grub loading but no menu appears and directly logins to ubuntu
2010-02-25T22:40:00.000Z	fccf	esicam	There is a checkmark in the install that bypasses the login... edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and remove or comment out autologin
2010-02-25T22:42:00.000Z	fccf	esicam	please read carefully ... I already answered your question... be patient please
2010-02-25T22:50:00.000Z	esicam	fccf	Warning: unknown mime-type for "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" -- using "application/octet-stream"
