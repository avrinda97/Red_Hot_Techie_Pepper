2011-10-28T01:45:00.000Z	leeping		Hi there - 2 questions: 1) I just updated my Natty OS and my X server won't start.  This is a serious problem .. can anyone help me?  2) I want to compile the NVidia kernel module manually but it says the X server is running.  How do I stop it?  Thank you.
2011-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	why the manual way?
2011-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	because I tried sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current and that did not fix my problem.
2011-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	try uninstalling it then reinstalling
2011-10-28T01:50:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	I'm running into the same problem as before.  dmesg reports: http://paste.ubuntu.com/721117/
2011-10-28T01:51:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	what did you do again?
2011-10-28T01:51:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	I don't know for sure.  This morning I logged in remotely, it says reboot required, so I rebooted.
2011-10-28T01:51:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	sorry id forgotten already.. yeah the kernel would have gone from 2.38 to 3
2011-10-28T01:52:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	I see.  Can I kill the X server and compile the kernel module myself?
2011-10-28T01:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	upgrading is a pita
2011-10-28T01:52:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	it says my kernel version is still 2.6.38
2011-10-28T01:52:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	oh, just update the packages? i htought you went from 11.04 to 10.10?
2011-10-28T01:53:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	when I uninstalled I don't get the kernel panic, but I don't get any display at all.  The screen is garbled
2011-10-28T01:54:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	what card is it btw?
2011-10-28T01:54:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	it's a Quadro 600.  Not sure what architecture.
2011-10-28T01:55:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	no
2011-10-28T01:57:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	it's like I get half a magenta square with some green lines and the rest is black
2011-10-28T01:58:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	it could be the firmware nouveau is trying to load
2011-10-28T02:00:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	is there no way to kill the X server?
2011-10-28T02:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	have you tried fully draining the power and letting it rest for couple minutes?
2011-10-28T02:05:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	sorry i forgot you had access to terminal
2011-10-28T02:06:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	I'll be back later.  Have to go somewhere right now
2011-10-28T04:22:00.000Z	Gentoo64	leeping	what abou backup files and clean install?
2011-10-28T04:22:00.000Z	leeping	Gentoo64	I would rather not have to do that .. this is my workstation and it has hundreds of GB of data on it, and I have spent 30+ hours compiling and installing things
