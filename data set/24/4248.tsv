2007-06-17T07:47:00.000Z	unagi		this is true
2007-06-17T07:47:00.000Z	unagi		though it is strange that in linux....bluetooth devices etc are folders
2007-06-17T07:48:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	thats because EVEYRTHING in linux is a file
2007-06-17T07:48:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	see that file copy command? its a file.  the thing that draws the borders around windows? its a file.  :P u get the idea

2007-07-13T06:23:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	yes, i think so
2007-07-13T06:30:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	its definitely possible :P
2007-07-13T06:30:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	i have no idea
2007-07-13T06:32:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	a programming langauge
2007-07-13T07:01:00.000Z	shiester_miester	unagi	there are some open-source ones, i think, you can probably find them and compile them for ubuntu
