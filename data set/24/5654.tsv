2006-07-26T11:05:00.000Z	WiseOdd		hmm. next problem... somehow i have lost about 19 GB on a brand new disk... theres never been anything on the disk, but instead of 279GB theres only 261GB free... hows that?
2006-07-26T11:06:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	what's df -h say?
2006-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	it may just be the reserved blocks - you can tune2fs to drop/eliminate those if you wanted
2006-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	yeah, that's just reserved blocks
2006-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	if it bothers you, tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sda1
2006-07-26T11:10:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	it's actually currently 5 - and if you want 1 instead, make the param 1 instead of 0 in that line I gave you
2006-07-26T11:11:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	it's actually "Flav", thanks
2006-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	you need to run it as root
2006-07-26T11:15:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	the line above that likely said "Permission denie"
2006-07-26T11:16:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	can you paste the exact command and output?
2006-07-26T11:16:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	(pastebin or pm or whatever)
2006-07-26T11:17:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	or use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-07-26T11:18:00.000Z	WiseOdd	Flav	did u get the pm?
2006-07-26T11:18:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	no
2006-07-26T11:19:00.000Z	WiseOdd	Flav	hmm... 2 sec
2006-07-26T11:20:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	what's the output of "mount"?
2006-07-26T11:25:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	try tune2fs -m 0 /dev/hda1 to see if that works
2006-07-26T11:26:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	you shouldn't need to - i'm not sure why it's not working.
2006-07-26T11:27:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	FWIW, though, as Alpha232 said, root is allowed to write to the full capacity, so it's not like that 15GB is really lost
2006-07-26T11:28:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	well, if there's nothing of value stored there, you can umount /media/usbdisk then mke2fs -m 0 /dev/sda1
2006-07-26T11:29:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	well, you're running as root right now, so you could use those 15GB fine
2006-07-26T11:30:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	good
2006-07-26T11:30:00.000Z	WiseOdd	Flav	but thnax alot for the help! Real nice!
2006-07-26T11:32:00.000Z	Flav	WiseOdd	you can also "sudo -s" to get a shell if you need to do a few different things in sudo and don't want to prefix "sudo" a bunch
