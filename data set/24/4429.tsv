2007-04-17T15:22:00.000Z	MasterGH		hi, could someone help me get my sound working again? I'm using Edgy
2007-04-17T15:22:00.000Z	foug	MasterGH	make sure it isn't muted
2007-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	MasterGH	foug	its not muted
2007-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	foug	MasterGH	you've opened alsa mixer and double checked? MM = muted, make sure all channels are unmute
2007-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	MasterGH	foug	I'll look again
2007-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	foug		anyone know why my video lags when I try to go full screen? I've installed my drivers as far as i know (beryl is running) dma=on if that helps at all, I never had this problem in windows.
2007-04-17T15:24:00.000Z	MasterGH	foug	how do I make sure they are all un-muted? a command I can do?
