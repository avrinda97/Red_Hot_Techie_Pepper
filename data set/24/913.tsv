2011-01-11T01:15:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Everybody does
2011-01-11T01:17:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	yes
2011-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	When you log in or when the system starts?
2011-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Everything in /etc/rc2.d/ get started
2011-07-23T18:41:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	mmm that's odd.  Do you have samba-server installed?
2011-07-23T18:42:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Is smbd showing up in ps -e  ?
2011-07-23T18:42:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	It's strange that it's not in there.  Perhaps there is another place it might be ....
2011-07-23T18:44:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	I'm fairly sure it will start on reboot.
2011-07-23T18:45:00.000Z	GeekMan	edbian	if im using ssh and do a system update that requires me to restart can i still shh log on after the reboot (its a stupid question)
2011-07-23T18:45:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	yes.  ssh is another service so it starts before anybody logs in
2011-07-23T18:47:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Can you pastebin ls /etc/rc2.d/  ?
2011-07-23T18:47:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	thanks
2011-07-23T18:51:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	paste.ubuntu.com  is probably easier
2011-07-23T18:53:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	reading...
2011-07-23T18:53:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	I am very confused.  ssh is not listed here either!
2011-07-23T18:55:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	yeah... all run levels
2011-07-23T18:57:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Those are run levels.  rc2.d is the one normally used.  0 is for shutdown, 6 is for reboot, 1 is single user mode.  The others aren't really used in debian
2011-07-23T18:58:00.000Z	GeekMan	edbian	thats nice to know i read about that somewhere but i have since for gotten so what should we do write some scripts i had to do something similar to make my fans work on an ibookg4
2011-07-23T18:59:00.000Z	edbian	GeekMan	Well when you install ssh it should but a script in /etc/rc2.d/  Reboot the machine and see if sshd starts again.  Then we'll look for it.
