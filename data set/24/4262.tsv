2007-05-24T10:05:00.000Z	juliusspencer		hi... anyone know how to check the version of a pci slot from within linux?
2007-05-24T10:05:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 could 'lspci' do it?
2007-05-24T10:06:00.000Z	juliusspencer		I tried that and another one dmidecode... no luck
2007-05-24T10:06:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	or I couldn't interpret the reulsts....
2007-05-24T10:07:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 what do you mean by version?
2007-05-24T10:09:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	apparently there are different versions of PCI like version 1 and 2 and 2.2.,.. I'm not sure on the specs, but I have a digium/asterisk card and it needs 2.2. The card doesn't show up in the lspci listing yet the kernel requirements are like 2.2 or 2.4 so no worries there!
2007-05-24T10:09:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	so while I have found the specs for my motherboard are sifficient in a doc online, I want to see what the OS thinks
2007-05-24T10:10:00.000Z	mdious		juluisspencer:  ah I follow now...have you had a look in your kernel to see if version 2 of pci and that is enabled?
2007-05-24T10:11:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	I'm not sure... I'm using a standard distro kernel... uh... I have ubuntu on my laptop, but not on this particulr computer
2007-05-24T10:11:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 perhaps it's not just in there...will have a look and see if i can find where it would be
2007-05-24T10:11:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	it should make no diff though...
2007-05-24T10:11:00.000Z	juliusspencer		yeah... seems odd though as PCI v 2.2 is retty old.
2007-05-24T10:11:00.000Z	juliusspencer		like 2004 or before
2007-05-24T10:12:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	I mean... it probably came out around 2003 I'm guessing atthe latest
2007-05-24T10:12:00.000Z	juliusspencer		so talking start of 2.6 kernel
2007-05-24T10:12:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 just look around with make menuconfig and see if all the pci stuff is enabled :)
2007-05-24T10:13:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	yeah... always found that really clunky...
2007-05-24T10:13:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	kow if there's a search other than looking in the actual file?
2007-05-24T10:13:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 it's the only thing i've ever used
2007-05-24T10:14:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	thanks for the tip all the same.
2007-05-24T10:14:00.000Z	mdious	juliusspencer	 does cat /proc/pci bring anything up?
2007-05-24T10:15:00.000Z	juliusspencer		no
2007-05-24T10:15:00.000Z	juliusspencer		(I think)
2007-05-24T10:15:00.000Z	juliusspencer	mdious	I think I tried that
