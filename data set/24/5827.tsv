2006-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	Mustang97		for right now I'm not concered bout the workgroup..   I just need to be able to open my Networking..   I have both hardwire and wireless networking.
2006-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	have you pasted /etc/network/interfaces to the pastebin yet?
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	I don't know what the pastebin is.
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	wen you are trying to access wireless, have you disabled the wired one?
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	^^
2006-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	 disable / inable..   That would be in the "System >> Administration >> Networking"   correct?  If so I cant get it open.
2006-04-19T10:29:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	in teminal type 'nano /etc/network/interfaces' and paste it to the pastebin link that ubotu gave above
2006-04-19T10:31:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	Okay, I just submitted it.

2006-04-19T10:40:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	then change the line that looks like this 'iface eth1 inet dhcp' to 'iface ath0 inet dhcp'
2006-04-19T10:41:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	 "sudo: unable to lookup via gethostbyname()"
2006-04-19T10:43:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	are you logged in as root?
2006-04-19T10:43:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	Yes
2006-04-19T10:44:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	you can forget typing sudo then
2006-04-19T10:45:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	   The sudo not working.  would that be why when I try to open my networking settings it dont open?
2006-04-19T10:45:00.000Z	arrick	Mustang97	if your signed in as root, you dont need to type sudo
2006-04-19T10:46:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	: oh..
2006-04-19T10:47:00.000Z	Mustang97	arrick	when you say logged in you mean login root or the username it asked me to create?    is their a diff from root and administrative?
