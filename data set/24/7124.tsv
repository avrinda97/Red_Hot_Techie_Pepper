2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	u have to install that
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	Hence why it is the Un-official guide ;)

2005-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 wget http://myosc.org/ubuntuguide/menueditor_0.4.3ubuntu1_all.deb
2005-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	dpkg -i menueditor_0.4.3ubuntu1_all.deb
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 He assumed you had downloaded the program that I had directed you to.
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 That's all ;)
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 current directory ;)
2005-04-20T14:37:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 i.e., open a terminal - run the wget cmd, and then run dpkg to install it ;)
2005-04-20T14:37:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 Now, the Menu Editor or whatever it was called should be there and you should be all set...
2005-04-20T14:37:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 Ubuntu ROCKS! :)
2005-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	is because the item in your menu is probably 'system wide' or in other words, you don't have the right privileges to erase such item in the menu.
2005-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	alterim	andysl	what you have just said conflicts with what ogra has just said
2005-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	however, if you create a menu item as current user - you will be able to delete/etc. it.
2005-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 The menu editor basically does this...
2005-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 There are files that contain information - in fact - think of it the same way microsoft windows handles menu's, with .lnk files and such...
2005-04-20T14:49:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	Manually do it
2005-04-20T14:49:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 Or, run the Menu editor AS root
2005-04-20T14:50:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	sudo file
2005-04-20T14:53:00.000Z	alterim	andysl	i'd quite like to get rid of these menu items!
2005-04-20T14:53:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 I understand - I'm looking for the menu 'stuff' in my filesystem right now lol
2005-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	andysl	alterim	 Do what ogra said
