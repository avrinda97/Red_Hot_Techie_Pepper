2010-01-18T19:28:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	try 192.168.1.1/filename ?
2010-01-18T19:29:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	sorry 127.0.0.1/filename
2010-01-18T19:35:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	if you need the server for local use only, then try xampp
2010-01-18T19:35:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 ya i tried to install it but failed
2010-01-18T19:36:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	it's pretty easy...  but make sure you UNinstall the synaptic packages for apache, mysql, phpmyadmin, proftp, etc
2010-01-18T19:39:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	anyway, what I've done is create a folder "server" in my home directory, then symbolically linked it into the webserver's root directory.  Now i just go to "localhost/server/" and I can access all of files in server.  This way I dont have to deal with permissions at all.
2010-01-18T19:41:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	what do you mean with symbolically link?
2010-01-18T19:41:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	it's like a shortcut
2010-01-18T19:43:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 well i can create a shortcut but i cant really change the aim of the shortcut
2010-01-18T19:44:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	go to terminal, and type sudo nautilus
2010-01-18T19:44:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	now go to your server root file (htdocs, or whatever it is)
2010-01-18T19:45:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	now open yoru home folder in a SEPARATE browser
2010-01-18T19:46:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	then drag the folder "server" into the root webserver folder, pressing Ctrl+Shift, release the mouse
2010-01-18T19:47:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	now you should be able to access the contents of "server" from localhost/server
2010-01-18T19:47:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	if yoru server is running
2010-01-18T19:48:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 yep it works thanks, i still got no directory though
2010-01-18T19:49:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 in my browser
2010-01-18T19:49:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	put some files in "server" and see if you get directory listing?
2010-01-18T19:49:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 im sroyy, it works, just german umlaute ; )
2010-01-18T19:49:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	glad to hear it works
2010-01-18T19:49:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	causing trouble :D  great thanks!
2010-01-18T19:50:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	np
2010-01-18T19:51:00.000Z	hl_99	swiftarrow	 there is one weird thing, folders, which contain files, do not appear in the directory
2010-01-18T19:51:00.000Z	swiftarrow	hl_99	very strange.  out of my range of knowledge, sorry!
