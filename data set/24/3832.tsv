2010-10-08T04:22:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	ask here, there is also #ubuntu-eg
2010-10-08T04:23:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	this is a support channel; did you have a support question? you might wish to read the ubuntu manual
2010-10-08T04:24:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	okay, well chat in #ubuntu-offtopic , as this is tech support only
2010-10-08T04:24:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	yes, in #ubuntu-offtopic , unless you have specific support requests
2010-10-08T04:25:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	this is not the channel to discuss that in
2010-10-08T04:25:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	#ubuntu-offtopic for that
2010-10-08T04:53:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	you dont need to do that. see the bot statement above
2010-10-08T04:54:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	so there is no changing it
2010-10-08T04:55:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	no you dont. I just told you
2010-10-08T04:56:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	its already there.
2010-10-08T04:57:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	this is not red hat
2010-10-08T04:58:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	so please stop asking to change runlevels
2010-10-08T05:11:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	about what
2010-10-08T05:12:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	you should have read the statement above carefully.
2010-10-08T05:13:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	so stop asking for it.
2010-10-08T05:14:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	sure you can. that's for red hat. oracle is geared towards red hat
2010-10-08T05:19:00.000Z	bazhang	almoparmeg	it does.
