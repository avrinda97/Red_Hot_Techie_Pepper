2011-02-19T11:18:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	use a popular torrent with a low # of leechers, and test among different clients
2011-02-19T11:18:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	I know, thus why I suggested he use the same torrent file for each client.
2011-02-19T11:21:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	:)
2011-02-21T12:09:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	I already ointed him that way
2011-02-21T12:09:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	My apologies. :)
2011-02-21T12:10:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	sorry for sounding like a *** lol I just noticed that
2011-02-21T12:10:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	Haha, no I didn't think you sounded like one. I understand -- I would have done the same thing. Totally understandable.
2011-02-21T12:11:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	but if you just joined the channel you didn't know lol
2011-02-21T12:12:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	Yeah I did. I usually wait and watch a bit but msot people don't invoke the bot much so botting is usually a safe bet. I should have stayed back though, so no hard feelings man. :)
2011-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	silverarrow, correct, but the ones on the repos have been tested for compatability. so to ensure compatability, get the repo one
2011-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	silverarrow: Right. It may be a little old but it'll at least work.
2011-02-21T12:25:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	silverarrow, if you get the "newest" one, it may have bugs and that may be the reason ubuntu hasnt hosted it on the the repos
2011-02-21T12:29:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	I agree. :) Pain in the patootie lol
2011-02-21T12:36:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	correction, typing to fast
2011-02-21T12:48:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	no
2011-02-21T12:48:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	Zeu5, dont use $USER
2011-02-21T12:49:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	Zeu5, $USER is ubuntu be ecause your using the CD, type type: sudo chown (username on your other operating system) /path/to/ice
2011-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	yes, $USER replaces $USER with the current logged in user when you run it, just like $PATH is replaced by executable directories
2011-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	Hmph. Didn't know that. I guess that's what I get from working with PHP. :/ I'll keep that in mind, though. Thanks for the heads-up
2011-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	try it, go into terminal and type $USER and hit enter
2011-02-21T12:52:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	I figured it out. ;)
2011-02-21T13:03:00.000Z	Senjai	Starminn	he doesnt need to be confused at the moment
2011-02-21T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	Senjai	I agree. Just telling him not to worry
