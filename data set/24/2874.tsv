2012-04-27T11:14:00.000Z	oal		I upgraded to 12.04 now, but my mouse pointer is stuck on only one of my two screens
2012-04-27T11:15:00.000Z	oal		When I move it to the edge of my left screen, it stops, but I can see half the cursor on the right
2012-04-27T11:15:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	move it as far to the other side of the screen as you can
2012-04-27T11:16:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	it stops there as well
2012-04-27T11:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	do you have auto-hide enabled for your dockamijig?
2012-04-27T11:16:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	how do I enable that?
2012-04-27T11:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	ok, maybe we should start over, are you using any proprietary drivers for graphics?
2012-04-27T11:17:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	yes, nvidia
2012-04-27T11:18:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	and how did you set up your dual monitors? through the Displays settings?
2012-04-27T11:18:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	nvidia-settings
2012-04-27T11:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	and I assume you chose extended, not twinview?
2012-04-27T11:19:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	let me check. I use the same configuration I used under 11.10, and it worked fine before
2012-04-27T11:20:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	I can only choose between twinview and separate x screen. It's twinview now
2012-04-27T11:20:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	did you have to re-set it up after installing 12.04 or did it use config files from your /home?
2012-04-27T11:21:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	when this first happened, I reconfigured it, but got the same result
2012-04-27T11:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	I think you should disable the dual monitor, then apply the settings change and then try to set it up again (separate xscreen style)
2012-04-27T11:22:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	ok, I'll give it a try, thanks
2012-04-27T11:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	IIRC, you should have use the mouse to select where the second screen goes
2012-04-27T11:27:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	no difference :(
2012-04-27T11:27:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	when you setup the separate xscreen, did the other monitor turn all grey and give you an X cursor?
2012-04-27T11:27:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	yup
2012-04-27T11:29:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	I think you're supposed to click and drage the monitor you want there there, does that make sense?
2012-04-27T11:30:00.000Z	oal	gaelfx	from the ubuntu screen manager or nvidia-settings? The ubuntu one seems to only detect 1 screen and calls it "laptop"
2012-04-27T11:30:00.000Z	gaelfx	oal	nvidia-settings, the other one is mostly useless
