2008-06-03T09:50:00.000Z	cmatt85		I hate to bother you guys but, i am running feisty(7.10) I let it update a few days ago and since then i seem to have lost some desktop functionality, i can no longer see my icons and the context click (on the desktop) no longer functions. Any ideas?
2008-06-03T09:52:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	hi..its likely that we can help you fix this problem..however problems with upgrades are far too frequent to assume that this will be the last one..a fresh install make a lot of sense
2008-06-03T09:53:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	icons invisible in gnome panel?
2008-06-03T09:55:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	then where are icons invisible
2008-06-03T09:58:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	you changes anything in gxonf-editor..that sounds like the "display_volumes" flag is set to false
2008-06-03T09:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	one sec
2008-06-03T10:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	gconf-editor..in apps>nautilus>desktop..is "volumes visible" checked?
2008-06-03T10:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	so you have mounted volumes that dont show up...strange..try sudo killall nautilus&&nautilus..see if it gives a useful error mesg
2008-06-03T10:04:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	ps -A|grep nau
2008-06-03T10:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	nautilus is responsible for drawing the desktop
2008-06-03T10:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	open up any folder..nautilus is the file manager
2008-06-03T10:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	works?
2008-06-03T10:07:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	run from terminal...run the grep command first
2008-06-03T10:07:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	using the default icon theme is assume?
2008-06-03T10:07:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	some icon themes are buggy/incomplete
2008-06-03T10:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	terminal output?
2008-06-03T10:10:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	glad to help..what happened exactly though?
2008-06-03T10:10:00.000Z	cmatt85	anirudh0	That worked! Thank you! will they stay there?
2008-06-03T10:10:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	if you _really_ need it..i have some stuff to do otherwise
2008-06-03T10:11:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	hay..misread the question :)
2008-06-03T10:11:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	yes..they should..else add nautilus& to the startup programs in sys>prefs>sessions
2008-06-03T10:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	it also means that your home folder will get opened in the file manager when you login
2008-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	you need to kill all instances of nautilus..then start it again
2008-06-03T10:15:00.000Z	anirudh0	cmatt85	it starts with an option when you start from the panel.. "--filemanger-mode" or something like that
