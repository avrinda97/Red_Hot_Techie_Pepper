2010-05-02T17:35:00.000Z	user01		i just have no idea how big partitions are these days in 10.04
2010-05-02T17:37:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	for long term use i am looking at putting /usr on its own partition at 20gb.
2010-05-02T17:44:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	possibly since ext4 isn't as stable as ext3...relatively speaking.
2010-05-02T17:45:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	thats why i wanted it as boot :)
2010-05-02T17:45:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	ext3 that is
2010-05-02T17:57:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	in your home folder under ~/.virtualbox
2010-05-02T17:57:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	OK thanks, just to know how big to make usr
2010-05-02T17:58:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	will you install many *-doc packages  ?
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	maybe
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	you mean man pages?
2010-05-02T18:00:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	man pages are just one portion of things a doc package might provide. i installed just about all the python-*-doc packages i could and my / partition is nearly full...im looking at moving /usr to a new 20gb partition.
2010-05-02T18:01:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	well i was going to use at least 20GB for usr because Im going to do  full tex-live install
2010-05-02T18:02:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	and i just  bought a 500GB hard drive, but i wanted to use that for downloads mainly
2010-05-02T18:04:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	was thinking 50 GB for usr
2010-05-02T18:04:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	also consider what would be stored in /var ( are you going to be running mysql or apache etc etc ? )
2010-05-02T18:05:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	yep, it is a webserver too
2010-05-02T18:06:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	but there is logrotate too . . .
2010-05-02T18:07:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	maybe you would like to use the server version of ubuntu, it provides ability to have folders to exist across many partitions.
2010-05-02T18:08:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	well its being used primary as a desktop
2010-05-02T18:08:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	maybe investigate LVMS then ?
2010-05-02T18:08:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	i dont like lvms
2010-05-02T18:09:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	it looks all messy
2010-05-02T18:09:00.000Z	jadakren	user01	unfortunate. i don't understand it yet... although having the ability to expand the size of a partition by adding new drives is nice
2010-05-02T18:10:00.000Z	user01	jadakren	i know, but it just seems to cover up problems
