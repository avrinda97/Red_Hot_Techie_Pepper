2009-01-21T04:59:00.000Z	zero__		Ok, so i installed ubuntu once, like few h ago, but while updating the whole ubuntu crashed cuz of gnome updating was broken, and i installed again and now i got bug with audiocard, i hear sound in Speakers AND my headphones.... how to make it only working on headphones?
2009-01-21T04:59:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	so your speakers play when headphones are in and playing?
2009-01-21T05:00:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	what kind of comp?
2009-01-21T05:00:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	 and what kind of audio card?
2009-01-21T05:01:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	if you type lspci in terminal, your comp will tell you the audio device
2009-01-21T05:02:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	"standard" is not a type of audio card
2009-01-21T05:03:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	that is the driver
2009-01-21T05:06:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	looking...is it a laptop?

2009-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	that might work, but it is for Edgy...not Hardy, which I assume you are running
2009-01-21T05:09:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	also read a variety of reports that say restarting works
2009-01-21T05:10:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	ya, /etc/whatever
2009-01-21T05:18:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	you have to be root
2009-01-21T05:18:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	type sudo before the copy command
2009-01-21T05:18:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	do it in terminal
2009-01-21T05:20:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	in terminal, type sudo...then the command to copy the source to the destination /etc/whateverthenameis
2009-01-21T05:27:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	yup
2009-01-21T05:27:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	then you type it, and you get access as root
2009-01-21T05:38:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	try google searching for open source drivers for your audio card
2009-01-21T05:39:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	lspci
2009-01-21T05:39:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	you can also type history and get all of the previous 100 commands
2009-01-21T05:39:00.000Z	|unjustice|	zero__	also, the up arrow will automatically prompt the previous command if you want to run it
