2009-03-16T02:38:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	use a live CD, mount your ubuntu partition and then use "grub-install" to reinstall the bootloader
2009-03-16T02:39:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	Could you be a bit more specific? where do I have to install grub?
2009-03-16T02:40:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	the "grub-install" manual page has some info.    It is something like "grub-install (hd0) --root-directory=/mountpoint/of/the/installed/ubuntu"
2009-03-16T02:41:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	that will install the bootloader to the Master Boot Record of the first hard drive (hd0) then it will setup the /boot/grub directory to the root directory
2009-03-16T02:42:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	What about the running grub part?
2009-03-16T02:42:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	what?
2009-03-16T02:43:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	in the various helps on the official ubuntu site it mentions opening grub doing root and setup
2009-03-16T02:44:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	those steps are more low level, while "grub-install" is more like higher level, it should be recommended more.
2009-03-16T02:46:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	Ok I did it... it says: This is the contents of the device map /media/disk/boot/grub/device.map.
2009-03-16T02:46:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	seems correct
2009-03-16T02:47:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	Ok thanks.. I try to reboot fingers crossded
2009-03-16T02:53:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	wassup?
2009-03-16T02:53:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	No luck >*
2009-03-16T02:54:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	I still get Error 2 at stage 1.5 >*
2009-03-16T03:00:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	if you have a Windows CD use that to install the Windows Bootloader, then repeat the steps I provided to reinstall grub.
2009-03-16T03:01:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	This is the output of my fdisk -l http://paste.ubuntu.com/131761/
2009-03-16T03:02:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	might read this at least http://www.uruk.org/orig-grub/errors.html
2009-03-16T03:03:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	Yes it says "Selected disk doesn't exist" which is not very helpful :(
2009-03-16T03:05:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	might be BIOS problem? Check your BIOS when the PC boots. But do that, reinstall the bootloader with Windows, then make sure it works, then reinstall grub.
2009-03-16T03:07:00.000Z	lore_	vocx	Don't thinks so, but thanks. It woas working till I messed up something in grub
2009-03-16T03:07:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	can you remember what you were messing?
2009-03-16T03:08:00.000Z	vocx	lore_	what's that?
