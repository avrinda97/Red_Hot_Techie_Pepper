2006-01-15T16:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Yeah, see !dualboot
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	And google linux on laptops, and look around on some of those sites to see if anyone has tried it on your model.
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	they have
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Yep.
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Were they successful?
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	yes
2006-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Yes, I've done it on two.
2006-01-15T16:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	I have a fat for sharing, I think I made it about 5G.
2006-01-15T16:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Good luck!
2006-01-16T17:53:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	hi
2006-01-16T17:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	You're back.
2006-01-16T17:53:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	any reason why the previous attempt at installing failed during base package installation
2006-01-16T17:53:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	on my desktop, it's taking really long for the "passwd" package
2006-01-16T17:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Could be internet connection thing, system resources, or who knows what.  I'd say don't worry about it unless it stops entirely.
2006-01-16T17:55:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	it did last time
2006-01-16T17:55:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	it crashed during base package installatio
2006-01-16T17:55:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	referred me to an inexistant log
2006-01-16T17:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Not fun.  Not sure why.
2006-01-16T06:06:00.000Z	vincenz	tonyyarusso	crap, exactly same problem as before while installing a base package
2006-01-16T06:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vincenz	Could your CD be bad?
