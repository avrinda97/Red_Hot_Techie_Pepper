2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	moquist		/etc/init.d/gdm {re}start still does nothing... grr.
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	moquist		and when I run Xorg directly, of course no apps/wm/gnome happen(s).
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	moquist		and I even have 'gnome-session' in my .xinitrc...
2005-02-05T10:00:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Odd.
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	apparently no startx with Xorg.  ??
2005-02-05T09:57:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Oh!
2005-02-05T09:57:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	I know that problem.
2005-02-05T09:57:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	You need to run dexconf at the end.
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Reconfiguring just changes the database values.
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Dexconf writes them out.
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	k...
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	If you look at the top of the file, it explains that.
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	By file, I mean your XF86Config
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	huh.  well look at that pretty /etc/X11/xorg.conf file... :)
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	I'm running Hoary, so I get xorg.conf
2005-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	I'm just updating right now.
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	But yes, I went through the same process.
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	That's not a good sign.
2005-02-05T09:59:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Try startx.
2005-02-05T10:00:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	the only executable-looking file that I get with Xorg is "Xorg" - at least judging by what I see in 'dpkg -L xserver-xorg | less'
2005-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Was it in there?
2005-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	nope.
2005-02-05T10:02:00.000Z	pvh	moquist	Maybe some other hoar will jump in with some advice.
2005-02-05T10:17:00.000Z	moquist	pvh	I installed GDM and at least that's working now.
