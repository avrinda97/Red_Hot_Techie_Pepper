2007-03-03T09:20:00.000Z	riotkittie		vim is evil. nano is not.
2007-03-03T09:22:00.000Z	riotkittie		alt f2 gksu gedit file
2007-03-03T09:22:00.000Z	riotkittie		alt + f2
2007-03-03T09:23:00.000Z	riotkittie		6.10 and 6.06 are versions of a distribution, not distros themselves </anal retentive>
2007-03-03T09:25:00.000Z	riotkittie		ok. on to my crisis of the moment. i am stuck in x and it makes me a sad panda.  popped my wireless card in and my TTYs are black screens with single blinking cursors. whats a girl gotta do to fix this? :P
2007-03-03T09:26:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	um... if you have no GUI, you're not in X
2007-03-03T09:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	 uhm. if i had no GUI, i'd have not said i was stuck in X. kthx.
2007-03-03T09:27:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	seems like login can't run, does "ps aux" show the other ttys?
2007-03-03T09:28:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	 nope
2007-03-03T09:28:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	anything changed in your init since last it worked?
2007-03-03T09:29:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	not that i know of. this is a recurring issue when i put my wireless card in.
2007-03-03T09:29:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	so removing the wireless card cures it?
2007-03-03T09:30:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	what type?
2007-03-03T09:30:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	 IIRC, i need to remove it and reboot.  its been a while since i've bothered with it tho, so i'm not sure . uhm the card is a d-link airplus
2007-03-03T09:31:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	you're removing physical hardware while the system is ON?
2007-03-03T09:31:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	this isn't a hotplug device, is it? USB / Firewire?
2007-03-03T09:32:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	no, not removing hardware while the machine is on.             no, not usb/firewire. pcmcia.
2007-03-03T09:33:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	anything interesting in dmesg or boot.log ?
2007-03-03T09:42:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	 err. i dont seem to have a boot log :o
2007-03-03T09:43:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	it's /var/log/boot, but it's just the output of init (which may be useful nonetheless)
2007-03-03T09:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	not there, i swear.
2007-03-03T09:44:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	what version of ubuntu?
2007-03-03T09:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	preaction	dapper
2007-03-03T09:45:00.000Z	preaction	riotkittie	ah, that might explain it. any problem with a dist-upgrade?
