2011-03-06T07:19:00.000Z	pw-toxic		why shouldnt you start a vncserver as root?
2011-03-06T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	other people could log into your machine remotely using vncserver and then they're root on your machine
2011-03-06T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	then you use gksudo in the vnc-session
2011-03-06T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	Then it's just a security issue for other people on the lan logging in.  But it still messes up permissions and such
2011-03-06T07:22:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	i have my own lan because i use my server as a NAT between my lan and the public lan.    Can you tell me more about the permissions issue? what can happen and how?
2011-03-06T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	when settings files are written as root they later can only be read as root (when they should be able to be read by your user)
2011-03-06T07:25:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	sign in normally.  Do this: gksudo gedit /etc/apache2...
2011-03-06T07:28:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	in this case i get an error dialog box with the following message: "Failed to run gedit "/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf" as user root.      Unable to copy the users' Xauthroization file.
2011-03-06T07:28:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	gksudo gedit /etc/....     Use gksudo!!  I'm not saying it again
2011-03-06T07:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	as I said i executed the command you told me: "gksudo gedit /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf"   the errormessage i told you is the one i get on this command
2011-03-06T07:30:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	you h ave any idea why this happens?
2011-03-06T07:31:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	why what happens?
2011-03-06T07:31:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	the crashes?  I have no idea
2011-03-06T07:31:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	the errormessage when i use gksudo
2011-03-06T07:32:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	in the console there is the following: "Error copying '/var/run/gdm/auth-for-pw-toxic-C3dsmt/database' to '/tmp/libgksu-MZsj7Y'
2011-03-06T07:33:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	chmod 777 /tmp
2011-03-06T07:34:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	chmod -R 777 /tmp   (I think the permissions of the tmp folder are messed up since you have been running vnc as root
2011-03-06T07:34:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	no its still 777
2011-03-06T08:00:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	nano
2011-03-06T08:01:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	They're being sarcastic.  vi and emacs are notorious for having a learning curve.  nano is easy to learn
2011-03-06T08:01:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	is there something like copy and paste on nano?
2011-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	I think so.  Read the commands at the bottom of the nano screen
2011-03-06T08:09:00.000Z	edbian	pw-toxic	nano is great compared to vi  :)
2011-03-06T08:09:00.000Z	pw-toxic	edbian	i know.. i have tried vi and vim ;)
