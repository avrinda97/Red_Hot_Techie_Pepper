2006-10-04T12:31:00.000Z	vladuz976		how mature is the apt-get upgrade method when upgrading distro?
2006-10-04T12:32:00.000Z	vladuz976		what about third party packages?
2006-10-04T12:33:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	if they exist in your currently active repos for the new version of Ubuntu, they will be upgraded
2007-07-17T09:10:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	System > Prefs > Preferred Apps
2007-07-17T09:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	thanks
2009-03-04T18:08:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	why "should" it be at 1.9.2?
2009-03-04T18:08:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	do the monodevelop packages on LP say that 1.9.2 is released for Intrepid?
2009-03-04T18:09:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	the latest packages on the developer site will not tell you what to expect in Ubuntu's repos.
2009-03-04T18:09:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	oh wait, that was mono1.9 not monodevelop
2009-03-04T18:10:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	what do you *need* in this newer package?
2009-03-04T18:10:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	well, it has code completion for one thing
2009-03-04T18:10:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	"This new feature is so imprtant to my workflow I am willing to risk the stability and usability of my system." true?
2009-03-04T18:10:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	no, that's why I asked
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	so stick with Intrepid :)
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	and check backports
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	probably will
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	oh ok
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	didn't know about that
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	and you're apologizing for that?
2009-03-04T18:11:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	will google now
2009-03-04T18:12:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	no, for probably asking obvious questiosn
2009-03-04T18:12:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	uncomment backport repos in /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-03-04T18:12:00.000Z	mneptok	vladuz976	sudo apt-get update && apt-cache show monodevelop
2009-03-04T18:14:00.000Z	vladuz976	mneptok	yeah looks like only 1.0 is available
