2011-03-13T15:06:00.000Z	Tectu		hey guys. How can i export some .c and .h file which i donwloaded via Firefox to my system that i can use them with make?
2011-03-13T15:07:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Those are source files. What are you trying to do ultimately?
2011-03-13T15:07:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	That are librarys (sourcefiles) to programm microcontrollers.
2011-03-13T15:10:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	so, can you help me?
2011-03-13T15:11:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	I still have no idea what you are trying to accomplish
2011-03-13T15:12:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Did these files come with a Makefile? If not, you will likely want to build them with gcc..
2011-03-13T15:13:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	What does the code produce? Device driver?
2011-03-14T01:04:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	did you try gparted with your cruzer?
2011-03-14T01:04:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	thath worked for me
2011-03-14T01:04:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Yes, but it doesn't show this as a partition
2011-03-14T01:04:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	did you try to create new partitiontables too?
2011-03-14T01:05:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Yes, it works fine. Just that when you plug it in, it reports a new cd drive with this data in it
2011-03-14T01:06:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	okay, maybe you have a newer version, my cruzer is a few years old.
2011-03-14T01:07:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	I'm debating on whether or not it's worth it to remove, after all it's only 6.6MB out of 8GB
2011-03-14T01:08:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	i think that the space isn't the problem, it's just gay when it mounts every time a CD, dosn't it ;)
2011-03-14T01:08:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Yea and it makes the system think there was a disk inserted, etc. Kinda lame
2011-03-14T01:08:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	indeed.
2011-03-14T01:09:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	i never bought a sandisk stick again.
2011-03-14T01:09:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Also I think it works just fine without this software in the OS it's intended for
2011-03-14T01:09:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	what? is the new curzer shitsoftware supporting linux ubuntu??
2011-03-14T01:09:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	Well you probably should be careful about your language here
2011-03-14T01:10:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	The software that ships with these things usually target a particular known os, no names mentioned :P
2011-03-14T01:11:00.000Z	Tectu	soreau	am i right that some devices need sudo to umount?
2011-03-14T01:12:00.000Z	soreau	Tectu	You should use privileges when mounting/unmounting nodes
