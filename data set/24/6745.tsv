2005-07-29T10:35:00.000Z	dammage		hi, can some tell me why after installation grub just ends up with error 17 please?
2005-07-29T10:35:00.000Z	dammage		I have a swap partition (hda1) and / - ext3 (hda2), nothing else
2005-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	looks like your grub config is messed up, can you boot from a live CD and post it
2005-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	ah nice, way ahead of me then :)
2005-07-29T10:38:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	post `fdisk -l` too

2005-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	is your bios maybe a bit old
2005-07-29T10:52:00.000Z	dammage	Seveas	I had no problems with older distributions ...
2005-07-29T10:53:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	ENOIDEA (yet)
2005-07-29T10:55:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	try setting the partition type with cfdisk
2005-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	correct
2005-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	as root ..?
2005-07-29T10:56:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	odd :|
2005-07-29T10:59:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	indeed, should be ok
2005-07-29T10:59:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	do you have a e2fs_stage1_5 in /boot/gtub?
2005-07-29T10:59:00.000Z	dammage	Seveas	checking ...
2005-07-29T11:00:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	damn, that was my last idea :(
2005-07-29T11:02:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	correct
2005-07-29T11:07:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	yes
2005-07-29T11:08:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	before chrooting: mount -o bind /dev /chroot/dev
2005-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	mount -o bind /proc /chroot/proc will help too
2005-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	dammage	Seveas	whereby /chroot is my ubuntu mount point, right?
2005-07-29T11:11:00.000Z	Seveas	dammage	correct
2005-07-29T11:26:00.000Z	dammage	Seveas	how can I access host's /dev/ devices in chroot? I have access denied to all /chroot/dev devices ...
