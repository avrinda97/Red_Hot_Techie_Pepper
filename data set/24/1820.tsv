2009-08-26T23:09:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	LTS?
2009-08-26T23:09:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	long term support
2009-08-26T23:10:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	well... indeed its until 2012 isn't it?
2009-08-26T23:10:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	yes it is
2009-08-26T23:17:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	now I have an issue of my own, firefox sends me a message constantly that I need to restart it due updates but I have restarted it several times and the message keeps poping up
2009-08-26T23:18:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	thats weird, never heard of that. perhaps reinstalling it might solve that. you shouldnt lose any of your config as long as you dont delete the settings in your /home
2009-08-26T23:18:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	it all started to happen after I installed java.
2009-08-26T23:19:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	the dev tools? or the regular one
2009-08-26T23:19:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	first time it happens to me and I have installed and reinstalled ubuntu a few times, but this is the first time I see this issue, but indeed reinstalling it would be one solution
2009-08-26T23:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	i say just reinstall it mate. you wont lose your configs, but backup bookmarks etc just incase ;)
2009-08-26T23:20:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts
2009-08-26T23:20:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	sure i will reinstall it and see what happens. thanks for the help-
2009-08-26T23:21:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	maybe its just the plugin for FF giving you hassle?
2009-08-26T23:22:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	what do you suggest then?
2009-08-26T23:22:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	I believe its that
2009-08-26T23:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	see if you can find the plugin and disable it for now, just so the updates run correctly
2009-08-26T23:23:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	then you can re-enable it afterwards
2009-08-26T23:23:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	I disabled it but the message continues to pop up
2009-08-26T23:24:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	hmm.. yeah just reinstall that badboy, and see if that fixes it
2009-08-26T23:32:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	did that fix your problem?
2009-08-26T23:34:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	it seems to be fixed now
2009-08-26T23:35:00.000Z	Brazz	b3rz3rk3r	thank you indeed that was bugging me
2009-08-26T23:35:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Brazz	good stuff! glad it worked
