2007-02-04T14:18:00.000Z	LiENUS		what a mistake that was :/
2007-02-04T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	why?
2007-02-04T14:20:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	it's fine if you install ubuntu-desktop and all its dependencies beforehand
2007-02-04T14:20:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	and in any case, any breakages should be not too difficult to fix
2007-02-04T14:20:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	 i have a problem wherein xorg isnt installed
2007-02-04T14:21:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	the command should be 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg'
2007-02-04T14:22:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	that's fine though, as long as your X works
2007-02-04T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	no dependencies are broken, unless you get errors from 'sudo apt-get -f install'
2007-02-04T14:24:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	why don't you do a fresh install with feisty then
2007-02-04T14:24:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	 thats what i think im going to have to do
2007-02-04T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	it need not be. Especially if you have a separate home partition
2007-02-04T14:25:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	 i have a 20 gig drive
2007-02-04T14:26:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	there's no logic in what you are saying. I used to have separate home, var and root partitions in the days of 512 MB drives.
2007-02-04T14:27:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	i have to know how much space il'l need for system binaries and how much il'l need for user data to have seperate partitions
2007-02-04T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	so, do a 'du -s /home' and subtract the result from the "Used" column in 'df -h | grep /$'
2007-02-04T14:28:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	 my useage varies greatly
2007-02-04T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	yes
2007-02-04T14:47:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	 is there an alternative to syslinux that works with usb sticks bigger than 2 gigs?
2007-02-04T14:48:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	I don't know
2007-02-04T14:48:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	or partition your stick
2007-02-08T10:37:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	wow that was totally redudant and pointless
2007-02-08T10:38:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	thanks for pointing out my irresponsible use of bandwidth. However, since you're not the only person who has read this, it might have saved bandwidth in the long run.
2007-02-08T10:38:00.000Z	LiENUS	soundray	someone else already said it
2007-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	soundray	LiENUS	btw, you should rethink your attitude towards people who help you in this channel.
