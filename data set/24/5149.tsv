2006-10-12T14:28:00.000Z	xnt		Hi, does anybody know where are the Window Manager Configuration files in Ubuntu?
2006-10-12T14:30:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	new or old E?
2006-10-12T14:31:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	oh old E
2006-10-12T14:31:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	you can play new one with the E live cd dist its deb on the backend
2006-10-12T14:32:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	its also an installer
2006-10-12T14:34:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	its tne newer E anyway
2006-10-12T14:34:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	if you've got a pre-established system tweaked it won't be helpful
2006-10-12T14:35:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	unless you've setup skel correctly and can dump a packagelist to transfer over (ie have reinstall infos/stuffs setup for transfer)
2006-10-12T14:36:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	then you'd need a reinstall obviously and it wouldn't be ubuntu =P
2006-10-12T14:38:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	ty
2006-10-12T14:39:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	they seem very kdeish in the fact theres a billion customizations you can do
2006-10-12T14:40:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	i just wanted to test it since my supervisor recommended it
2006-10-12T14:40:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	but i'm thinking about using SuSE now...
2006-10-12T14:41:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	do you have much nix exposure?
2006-10-12T14:41:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	I don't know what do you mean with nix exposure... I'm not a native-english speaker :P
2006-10-12T14:43:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	about 4 years but just as a normal user... I'm a developer and used to be with doors... but now I'm beggining serious work...
2006-10-12T14:43:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	ah cool sounds like you have a fun job
2006-10-12T14:44:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	you don't normally find supervisors telling people to install a linux dist
2006-10-12T14:44:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	my supervisor is great, although he uses MacOS, but i don't have enough cash for a mac... matter of fact just got a new pc...
2006-10-12T14:45:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	yeah macs can be pricey and they can be annoying if you don't like the ui but if you can get past that they're nice (and the lack of docs)
2006-10-12T14:46:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	maybe in some years i'll use mac... aint know yet...
2006-10-12T14:46:00.000Z	iLLf8d	xnt	I'll probably get one too since you can run linux and osx on them now although they're definately too pricey
2006-10-12T14:48:00.000Z	xnt	iLLf8d	hope they get cheaper... Here in Mexico most people can't even afford to have a PC...
