2008-04-30T22:38:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		hello
2008-04-30T22:39:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		why has j2re1.4 been removed from hardy?
2008-04-30T22:40:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	I wish I knew. It was the best way to get a Java applet in 64bit...
2008-04-30T22:41:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	s/applet/plugin/
2008-04-30T22:41:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I'm going to try installing the old version
2008-04-30T22:42:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	remember the actual plugin is in a separate .deb
2008-04-30T22:42:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	yes...
2008-04-30T22:42:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	what do you mean?
2008-04-30T22:43:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	there is a package j2re1.4, and there is j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin -- you will want both.
2008-04-30T22:43:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	can't find those on hardy
2008-04-30T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	I know. You have to get them manually from archives.ubuntu.com
2008-04-30T22:44:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I didn't want to pollute my hardy installation with unofficial sw...
2008-04-30T22:44:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I guess there's a reason why it was removed
2008-04-30T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	I can understand that.
2008-04-30T22:45:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	have you tried gcjwebplugin ?
2008-04-30T22:45:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I think I have...other problems arise
2008-04-30T22:45:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	textboxes don't work
2008-04-30T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	yet another option is to get a 32bit firefox and the 32bit Sun Java plugin. Again, you'll be contaminating your system somewhat
2008-04-30T22:46:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I'm using 32bit hardy already
2008-04-30T22:46:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	oh
2008-04-30T22:47:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I can install jre5 or 6 but that applet I need doesn't work with those
2008-04-30T22:47:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	you could install gutsy as a virtual machine and run firefox and jre1.4 inside that
2008-04-30T22:48:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	soundray	I guess I could, but it would be awful
2008-04-30T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	cousin_luigi	it's the best idea so far, though ;)
