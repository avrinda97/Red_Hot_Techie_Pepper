2005-03-22T12:44:00.000Z	chlunde		Can I diable hwdetect and/or hotplug on the Hoary preview CD?
2005-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	Seveas	chlunde	why would you want that?
2005-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	Seveas		hello heze & Arnald
2005-03-22T12:45:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	Because the SATA-driver captures the resources used by my PATA CD-ROM, so I need to load ide-generic before I load ata-piix (the SATA driver)
2005-03-22T12:46:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	When I remove ata-piix and load it again I get an oops, so I would like to try to *never* load it.
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	Seveas	chlunde	is it a livecd or an installation?
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	Install
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	Seveas		then blacklist the SATA driver
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	Seveas		and let it be modprobed later
2005-03-22T12:47:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	How?  It's under installation..
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	It's already loaded before I get a shell on alt-f2
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas	chlunde	add it to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		and reboot :)
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	chlunde		Make a new CD?
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		no
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	chlunde		Bah, I should've gotten a CD-RW.
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		oww
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		wait
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		you still need to install it...
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	Seveas		now i get it :)
2005-03-22T12:48:00.000Z	chlunde		;)
2005-03-22T12:49:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	I think I'll try a Woody CD, (Warty didn't work either)
2005-03-22T12:49:00.000Z	Seveas	chlunde	file a bug report too
2005-03-22T12:49:00.000Z	chlunde	Seveas	Yes, I'll do that
