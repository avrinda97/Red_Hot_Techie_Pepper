2008-04-17T06:46:00.000Z	gaspipe1	Pelo	"disable multible logins for a single user"?
2008-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	yes,  , you'll need to select which users logs inautomaticaly form the drop down list
2008-04-17T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	scratch that ,  5th tab,   secutiry,    activate automatic login
2008-04-17T06:49:00.000Z	gaspipe1	Pelo	not sure if it worked but I guess I will see next time I boot up
2008-04-17T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	you did notice my second advice right ?  abut the 5th tab ?

2008-08-14T08:06:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	 sudo mkdir /media/WIN  && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/??? /media/WIN
2008-08-14T08:07:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	  /dev/sda1 will probably the devtree for your windows partiton then
2008-08-14T08:13:00.000Z	gaspipe1	Pelo	do i leave a "space" btwn /dev/sda1 and /media/win?
2008-08-14T08:13:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	yes
2008-08-14T08:13:00.000Z	gaspipe1	Pelo	still won't let me mount and I tried w/and w/out space
2008-08-14T08:14:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	/dev/sda1 might not be it for you, run   sudo blkid in the terminal to get a listing of your partitions
2008-08-14T08:14:00.000Z	Pelo	gaspipe1	you don'T need to run the sudo mkdir part of the command every time  only once just the stuff after && after that
2008-08-14T08:22:00.000Z	gaspipe1	Pelo	says that it's in use by windows.... will shut dwn then power up again
