2009-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	q0_0p		any one here can help me how to get internet from my linksys router that is connected to my at&t gateway?
2009-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	SBC or BellSouth?
2009-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	SBC
2009-10-08T10:30:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	i know they do NOT use VCP 35/8 (tried that and it failed with SBC, worked with BellSouth though)
2009-10-08T10:30:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	my at&t gatway is able to give the linksys an IP
2009-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	i connected one of the 4 ports on the AT&T gateway to the WAN of the Linksys router
2009-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	as an alterative, you can set your linksys to PPPOE and let the modem solely dialup (without the username and pass); have you tried that configuration?
2009-10-08T10:32:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	i will try and thanks for helping me out i will try it
2009-10-08T10:37:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	i have no luck
2009-10-08T10:38:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	did you set your att modem as gateway and removed the username and password from the att modem, and then in linksys enable pppoe, type your username and pass, and plug it in the main ethernet (not one of the four)?
2009-10-08T10:39:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	if i remove username and password from att modem i will not have internet
2009-10-08T10:39:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	any solution will require that while changing the physical configuration
2009-10-08T10:41:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	so u want to test to see if the linksys router is able to get on the internet solely on its own?
2009-10-08T10:41:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	not exactly, it still needs the modem, but you need to configure the att modem to be a gateway, not router, and configure your linksys for pppoe to dial the internet for the att gateway
2009-10-08T10:42:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	so my linksys will be the gateway and the at&t will be the router?
2009-10-08T10:43:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	opposite
2009-10-08T10:44:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	your att gateway serves as a modem and gateway/router, but you can get it to only act as a modem if you set it in gateway, then in linksys (router) pppoe (ppp over ethernet) with your username and password
2009-10-08T10:45:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	ah i c
2009-10-08T10:45:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	that makes sense
2009-10-08T10:45:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	it was confiusing to me for the longest time as well
2009-10-08T10:46:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	still learning ^^
2009-10-08T10:47:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	if att gateway serves at a modem can all the 4 ports that i have ppoe into the internet?
2009-10-08T10:47:00.000Z	q0_0p	cantscrollup	for example 4 routers connected to the 4 ports with ppoe
2009-10-08T10:47:00.000Z	cantscrollup	q0_0p	no, none of the four, it should be the primary one seperate from the four
