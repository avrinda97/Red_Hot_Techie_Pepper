2009-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	is the host alive/?
2009-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	kostas_thess1	blackxored	yes
2009-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	so it's on the same subnet?
2009-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		i connect to the machine over the internet
2009-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		via putty
2009-10-20T19:00:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		so its alive:p
2009-10-20T19:00:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	that wasn't what I asked the host you're targetting in on the same subnet as you're?
2009-10-20T19:00:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		when you say the same subnet you say the subnet at pc and subnet at this pc i am now?
2009-10-20T19:01:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	I say something like you being 192.168.100.1 and your target 192.168.100.129
2009-10-20T19:01:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	if it not then you have to check your gateway with "route -n"
2009-10-20T19:02:00.000Z	kostas_thess1	blackxored	http://pastebin.com/m3d1a8fe9
2009-10-20T19:02:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	so you have a default gateway try a traceroute to the host
2009-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	kostas_thess1	blackxored	if i make traceroute to the router 192.168.2.1 make it if i will do www.google.com it doesent ....
2009-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	then it's a problem with the router
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	kostas_thess1	blackxored	is possible the problem to be becouse i have opened all ports from 1 to 65535 to the ip of the pc
2009-10-20T19:04:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		is that a problem?
2009-10-20T19:13:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	no, it's outgoing traffic which is being filtered, it's hard to tell without seeing your tables, but that may be the problem
2009-10-20T19:13:00.000Z	kostas_thess1		i think blackxored you say iptables?
2009-10-20T19:14:00.000Z	blackxored	kostas_thess1	your router's table
2009-10-20T19:15:00.000Z	kostas_thess1	blackxored	until yesterday it works fine the downloads , etc. after opened all ports from 1 to 65535 from router to machine the problem has started
