2009-01-11T03:23:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	what is exactly the usb wireless adaptor you use ?
2009-01-11T03:25:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 WG111 netgear usb
2009-01-11T03:27:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	if you speak french i got a full doc for you :P
2009-01-11T03:28:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 ha, no i cant speak french. only english and broken espanol
2009-01-11T03:29:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	ok, i'll make you type 2 commands to check this is exactly that card that you're using. Open a terminal and please type "lspci | grep -i wireless"
2009-01-11T03:30:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 nothing, it didnt read anything
2009-01-11T03:31:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	"lspci | grep 802.11" then
2009-01-11T03:32:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	  still nothing. ill try different usb ports
2009-01-11T03:33:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	can you just type "lsusb" and "lspci" and paste the output of both to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com then please ?
2009-01-11T03:35:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	just type lsusb and look for something related to wireless, please
2009-01-11T03:36:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 yes, i see Bus 002 Device 003: ID 1385:4251 Netgear, Inc
2009-01-11T03:36:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	ok, that's really little info but i'll try to find you a driver ;)
2009-01-11T03:37:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 thanks, you might be saving be quite a bit of cabling
2009-01-11T03:38:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	do you know if your usb key has a number like v2 or v3 written somewhere ? it seems there are 3 versions of this usb key
2009-01-11T03:41:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 the box says v2
2009-01-11T03:43:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper this doc slightly outdated but the idea is there
2009-01-11T03:44:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	you'll also need the windows drivers (i suppose you know how to find them)
2009-01-11T03:44:00.000Z	FarmCretin	SiDi	 ill get them off the disk
2009-01-11T03:44:00.000Z	SiDi	FarmCretin	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=51993 here is a forum topic about someone with the same usb key, too
