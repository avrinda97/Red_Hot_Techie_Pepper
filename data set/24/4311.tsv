2007-05-11T06:21:00.000Z	Sunbow		-iMacThere4iAm: you can only install with powerpc until ubuntu edgy, in ubuntu feisty it isnt supported to powerpc
2007-05-11T06:22:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	 Can you explain more?
2007-05-11T06:25:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	This is Fiesty
2007-05-11T06:25:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	Fiesty
2007-05-11T06:26:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	No,  7.04 PPC
2007-05-11T06:27:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	let me have a look if i can find it
2007-05-11T06:31:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	Is there a quick way to find out exactly what version of ubuntu I am running?
2007-05-11T06:33:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	that says 7.04 fiesty
2007-05-11T06:34:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	pretty sure I got it via bittorrent but damned if I can rember where from!
2007-05-11T06:35:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	yes, that was it
2007-05-11T07:05:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	no luck i'm afraid
2007-05-11T07:07:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	would it help if i showed you my yaboot.conf file?
2007-05-11T07:08:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	know anyone who is?
2007-05-11T07:10:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	it runls beautifully, but atm i can still only boot from the cd
2007-05-11T07:12:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	i might try installing edgy because that seems to get the yaboot settings right first time, then go over it with fiesty
2007-05-11T07:12:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	only one
2007-05-11T07:12:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	and i don't want to reformat it because it has my main OS X install on it
2007-05-11T07:14:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	but?
2007-05-11T07:17:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	no :$
2007-05-11T07:19:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	i cleared a space, and in the installer, selected 'guided - use largest free space'
2007-05-11T07:22:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	ok
2007-05-11T07:25:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	I think I am going to install edgy and upgrade
2007-05-11T07:25:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	it seems likely to work
2007-05-11T07:26:00.000Z	iMacThere4iAm	Sunbow	because last time I installed that, it got yaboot working without any difficulty
