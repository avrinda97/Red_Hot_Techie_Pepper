2011-09-26T20:02:00.000Z	scwizard		I made a user called Abe and added him to the admin group
2011-09-26T20:02:00.000Z	scwizard		when I log in as abe, why don't I have permission to mkdir in /home/abe ?
2011-09-26T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	did you run:  sudo mkdir /home/abe
2011-09-26T20:03:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	that's what I'm justa bout to do of course
2011-09-26T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	well your question didn't mention sudo... so its a fair question
2011-09-26T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	did you also chown the home folder to the user?
2011-09-26T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	sudo chown abe:abe /home/abe
2011-09-26T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	the home folder gets made by default either when the user is made, or when it first logs in
2011-09-26T20:05:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	ok, and why are the persmissions of that home folder, such that the user who was just made doesn't have permission to write there?
2011-09-26T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	it should, you can chmod the folder so that it can
2011-09-26T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2011-09-26T20:06:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	maverick
2011-09-26T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	strange, never had an issue. are you using the:   --no-create-home     option? That will make it not make, you can use: sudo adduser abe --home /home/abe    and it should make the home for you
2011-09-26T20:08:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	nope, I was just doing adduser Charlie
2011-09-26T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	admin is in lowercase
2011-09-26T20:10:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	yeah I put it in lowercase when I made the users
2011-09-26T22:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	looks ok to me
2011-09-26T22:09:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	meaning you got the question I asked about scp, or it didn't get sent to the channel?
2011-09-26T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	it was received ok by the channel
2012-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	  echo "New settings" | sudo tee /etc/program/settings.conf
2012-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	sudo doesn't traverse the >
2012-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	if you want to ADD to the file, use:    tee -a
2012-04-10T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scwizard	you can run vlc-nox in cli and control it in CLI
2012-04-10T01:58:00.000Z	scwizard	ActionParsnip	ok, so vlc-nox is what it is called, ty
