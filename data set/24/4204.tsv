2007-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	You can just make some room without a partition
2007-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	ubuntu will make the partitions it needs, as long as there is room for it
2007-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	lengend		but i am afraid of it formatting my harddrive
2007-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	lengend		i have a 160gb harddrive, and 107gb of free space
2007-06-10T10:38:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	I don't remember if ubuntu liveCD allows you to resize the windows partition, but if it does, it might be a good idea.
2007-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	lengend		i don't have a live cd
2007-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	lengend		i have the newest version
2007-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	lengend		6.21 i think it is
2007-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	lengend		lol

2007-06-10T10:40:00.000Z	lengend		i got confused with mirc
2007-06-10T10:41:00.000Z	lengend	Brakkvatn	so if i use the ubuntu cd to make the partition it won't format my harddrive?
2007-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	Have you made a backup of stuff on your winXP partition?
2007-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	lengend		my harddrive is not partitioned
2007-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	lengend		but i have a external that i have a back up
2007-06-10T10:46:00.000Z	lengend		ok, i'll just try what you said to me, with the ubuntu cd to make the partition, i'll just back up
2007-06-10T10:46:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	Try letting ubuntu resize the current windows partition. i gotta go now. See you later
2007-06-10T10:46:00.000Z	lengend		ok, bye
2007-06-10T10:46:00.000Z	lengend		thank you for the help :)
2007-06-10T10:53:00.000Z	lengend		Hello, can someone answer quickly just need a yes or no: if i use the ubuntu cd to do the partition, and have xp mce and ubuntu install will it let me dual boot?
2007-06-10T10:54:00.000Z	lengend		i am doing that now, its just i have never used the ubuntu cd to partition, i use partition magic
2007-06-10T10:57:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	lengend	Yes. it will become dual boot
