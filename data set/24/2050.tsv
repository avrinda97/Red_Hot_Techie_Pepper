2011-02-28T01:39:00.000Z	ubox		ok doing it now
2011-02-28T01:40:00.000Z	ubox		win7
2011-02-28T01:40:00.000Z	ubox		oh
2011-02-28T01:41:00.000Z	ubox		let me see if there is an option
2011-02-28T01:42:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Virtualbox has a menu option when you start the VM (somewhere, my memory is a touch fuzzy) to install the guest additions.
2011-02-28T01:51:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	That file is the additions for a Windows guest, as the name suggests.  There should be something more suited to Ubuntu.
2011-02-28T02:03:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	That's the bunny.
2011-02-28T02:35:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	If it's fewer, check in Win7 if any of them start with a ".".  If it's more in Ubuntu, that's because it's showing hidden files.
2011-02-28T02:36:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	its less in ubuntu
2011-02-28T02:36:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Then I am not sure, but if any start with a . or end with a ~ they'll be hidden by Nautilus, maybe that's it?
2011-02-28T02:36:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	 its not even the same names
2011-02-28T02:37:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Not sure then, sorry...
2011-02-28T02:44:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Just click the network-manager applet?
2011-02-28T02:45:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	where is that app
2011-02-28T02:45:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	In Ubuntu, it's installed by default and should be in your tray.  It's the same tool you use to connect to wifi.
2011-02-28T02:46:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Top right.
2011-02-28T02:46:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	 is there another place that lists all the networks besides top right
2011-02-28T02:48:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	 my wireless adapter light keeps flickering like it is busy.  Is Ubuntu querying the device constantly or something
2011-02-28T02:49:00.000Z	Darael	ubox	Could be, but if it's a built-in wireless device there have been known issues with the LED not being driven properly, so that it's essentially lying to you.
2011-02-28T02:49:00.000Z	ubox	Darael	 its external usb device
