2009-10-21T22:21:00.000Z	dan7gg		hello .. i have a problem with a Ubuntu laptop (acer 5315). Can anybody help ?
2009-10-21T22:23:00.000Z	dan7gg		ok.. here it is. I have a router in the house. When I plug the ethernet cable it connects to the network, the dns works, but any connection freezes after the first 100 bytes or so. If I plug the internet cable and setup PPPoE  the internet connection works fine
2009-10-21T22:24:00.000Z	dan7gg		any other device i plug in the router works perfectly
2009-10-21T22:24:00.000Z	dan7gg		except for this acer laptop

2009-10-21T22:29:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	maybe you've tried this but...powercycling the modem, then router, then plugging in?
2009-10-21T22:29:00.000Z	dan7gg		i've tried all that
2009-10-21T22:30:00.000Z	dan7gg		when i type ifconfig on the eth0 device i get a large number of errors
2009-10-21T22:31:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	I had that problem on Fedora, it worked on a Vista machine but wouldn't work on my fedora box, I wasn't able to figure it out. I'm wondering if there's any firewall/ports/router issue?
2009-10-21T22:31:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	ooo - pastebin those errors :D
2009-10-21T22:32:00.000Z	dan7gg	d33d	 it's not with the firewall (direct PPPoE works fine), not with the router (any other device or OS works)
2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	right - read your errors and noticed that. can you paste what errors you're getting?
2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	pastebin! mind you :D
2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	dan7gg		don't know how to read them
2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	can you copy and paste from a terminal?
2009-10-21T22:33:00.000Z	dan7gg		what command should i use ? i've checked the system logs, but there's nothing there about the errors
2009-10-21T22:34:00.000Z	dan7gg		it says something like TX packets:20 errors:302 dropped:0
2009-10-21T22:35:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	that means you have a connection problem somewhere. i think.
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	dan7gg	d33d	 i'll do more research and come back soon
2009-10-21T22:36:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	i'm trying to find a good command for you to get some logs so we can figure this out :D
2009-10-21T22:38:00.000Z	d33d	dan7gg	this may seem silly - but try /etc/init.d/nscd restart
2009-10-21T22:39:00.000Z	dan7gg	d33d	brb 1 minute i'll try that
