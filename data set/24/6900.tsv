2009-12-21T14:06:00.000Z	dsl_		i have a simple script to copy files from /home to a network location and it works fine but when i create a launcher for it *that* doesn't work - can anyone help please?
2009-12-21T14:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	create a launcher for a terminal that runs that script
2009-12-21T14:08:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	I meant scriptname
2009-12-21T14:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	your script has hashbang in the beginning of it?
2009-12-21T14:09:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	yes it does...and a launcher with command /bin/bash doesn't open a terminal. what's wrong?
2009-12-21T14:10:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	of course it doesn't open a terminal, bash is a separate entity
2009-12-21T14:10:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	er, sorry I'm new to this :(
2009-12-21T14:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	make a launcher for "gnome-terminal -x /path/to/the/script" or something like that
2009-12-21T14:11:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	ah yes xterm is what I need lol
2009-12-21T14:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	of course, gnome-terminal to be replaced with whatever terminal app you're using, check the needed parameter for running a script from man <terminal>
2009-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	install build-essential. Are you sure though you need to compile it?
2009-12-21T14:32:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	i tried command gcc with no source file and it is installed
2009-12-21T14:33:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	yes i have instructions
2009-12-21T14:44:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	tried ./configure but it tells me CUPs library isn't installed but Software Centre says Configure Printers gtk front end for cups is installed...is that all i need?
2009-12-21T14:44:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	do you have the -dev packages installed? you need them to compile
2009-12-21T14:45:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	er, how to tell please?
2009-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	check which cups related dev packages you've got installed either via aptitude or synaptic
2009-12-21T15:00:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	ok i installed all the necessary stuff and './configure' worked fine. However make complains 'exec: g++: not found'
2009-12-21T15:00:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	ignore, that;s not installed either LOL
2009-12-21T15:19:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	well it compiled and make was ok but make install has 4 or 5 errors at the end but im not sure if they're critical
2009-12-21T15:20:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	I'm not an expert on compile issues, so I can't really help you too much
2009-12-21T15:27:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	I'm almost there, the only problem seems to be file permissions...i get 'cannot create regular file...blah...: Permission denied'
2009-12-21T15:44:00.000Z	dsl_	Myrtti	thank you also
2009-12-21T15:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	dsl_	no probs
