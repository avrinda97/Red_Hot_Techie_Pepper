2006-07-08T05:58:00.000Z	snoops		when using mplayer to play videos etc, I'd like to be able to disable my power saving settings (eg turn monitor off after 45 mins), how can I do that?
2006-07-08T05:59:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	System > Preferences > Screensaver
2006-07-08T05:59:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	not my screensaver, my power saving settings?
2006-07-08T05:59:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	one sec
2006-07-08T06:00:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	System > Preferences > Power Management
2006-07-08T06:00:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	write a shell script?
2006-07-08T06:01:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	I know Apple has made different energy saver settings for this kind of stuff, but Ubuntu isn't an Apple product
2006-07-08T06:02:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	I guess it I see it's silly that it isn't in some gui setting already.. You'd think when you play a video that you don't want the monitor to go into standby mode
2006-07-08T06:02:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	I don't know, I don't have that problem
2006-07-08T06:02:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	partly because I don't watch movies on my PC, and partly because I just kill my screensaver before I watch one
2006-07-08T06:03:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	the screensaver isn't the problem, it's power saving :)
2006-07-08T06:03:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	what kind of moniter?
2006-07-08T06:04:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	I've got a 17" Dell, and the only time it goes into low power mode is when the VGA signal gets cut, and that's controlled by software
2006-07-08T06:05:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	right, I have it set in power saving to turn off after 30 mins of inactivity.. no where can I see the option of disablity that when a video is played
2006-07-08T06:05:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	yea, you can write the software to do that, since it doesn't exsist, or hang around here for a month until some drunk colledge kid gets back from a frat party, and in his drunken stupididity he agress to write it for you
2006-07-08T06:06:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	I generally don't like to wait that long, plus, the code generally ends up drunk
2006-07-08T06:07:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	okay, I'm fine with the idea of writing it, but it needs to work transparently through the gui.. eg not encapsulting the player in a shell script that just disables it then runs the player I chose, but well, it needs to work when I just open a player
2006-07-08T08:31:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	I'm assuming grub installed itself on the wrong mbr (it happened to me)..heh
2006-07-08T08:32:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	yea, that's probably what happened
2006-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	64bit is awesome, don't turn people away from it
2006-07-08T08:52:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	until you try and use flash and find there's only 32bit support, no wine support, no win32 codecs
2006-07-08T08:54:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	I use a 32bit chroot for wine, and firefox windows edition, I can do flash *and* shockwave :P
2006-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	snoops	Snow_Shelter	right.. making a 32bit chroot is part of the 'but the hastle involved is inane'
2006-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	snoops	ok, well it wasn't that hard
