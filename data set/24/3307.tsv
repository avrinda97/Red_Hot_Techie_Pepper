2008-03-23T02:10:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle		Hey all, any thoughts on how to change the CLI (command line interface) resolution from its default (really HUGE) to something that better fits my monitor / graphics card capabilities?
2008-03-23T02:10:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	  sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
2008-03-23T02:10:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle		I tried using different kernel options in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-03-23T02:10:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	 So, that's a gui-way of configuring the CLI?
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	it's not a gui, it's an ncurses interface that will run on the console (near greenlake, by any chance?)
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	nikrud		sap if you find someone who's providing packages, yes.
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	 Eh, not so much near greenlake I'm happy to say. ;0)
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	In bothell.
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	nikrud		!language | goose (file->open disk)
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	 so i run that program, and it will run on top of my cli, or it will help me config the cli?
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	ah, down near rat city :)
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	config
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	you jest, I hope....
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	lol.
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	back in my day that's white city ;)
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	cool man, I'll try that, and see what happens.
2008-03-23T02:13:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	by white you mean lacking a multi-ethnic community?
2008-03-23T02:13:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	in the 70's the area between bothel and south seattle was called white city, that was it's name
2008-03-23T02:15:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	doh, brain fart. Thinging burien for bothell. Wrong end of the lake
2008-03-23T02:15:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	interesting tidbit.... on the subject of the console setup, its giving me a crap-load of keyboard options at the beginning...
2008-03-23T02:16:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle		what should I choose, I'm not finding a basic keyboard layout
2008-03-23T02:17:00.000Z	nikrud	SeanInSeattle	just accept the presets, you'll get to some character resolutions later. Not as nice as a framebuffer, but they work.
2008-03-23T02:18:00.000Z	nikrud		!gutsysources | schultza (try this first)
2008-03-23T02:19:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	nikrud	 does it take forever to reconfig the kernel and stuff after choosing all the appropriate options?
