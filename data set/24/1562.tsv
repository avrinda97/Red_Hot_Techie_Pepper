2009-11-25T06:12:00.000Z	rodgerr		Well - I have never had an occurrence on Windoz using Kaspersky but moving to Linux I am unsure how protected I am
2009-11-25T06:14:00.000Z	rodgerr		What program would I use to convert wav files to MP3 in Ubuntu
2009-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	Audacity.
2009-11-25T06:16:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	thanks
2009-11-25T06:16:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	no prob. You may want to install ubuntu-restricted-extras to get all necessary codecs.
2009-11-25T06:18:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	done - again - thanks!
2009-11-25T06:18:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	any time. :-)
2009-11-25T06:27:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	audacity recognizes the file but says it can not import it - i changed permissions to 777 but still not - any suggestions
2009-11-25T06:28:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	probably still needs some codec. I'll look into it. Hang in there.
2009-11-25T06:33:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	I'm just shooting in the dark from Googling, but try "sudo apt-get install lame libmp3lame0"
2009-11-25T06:50:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	got the following back - libmp3lame0 is already the newest version   - when I click "help" in audacity it says "wma-proprietary" which obviously it is not a wma file.
2009-11-25T06:51:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	so that's the error you are getting when you try to import the .wav?
2009-11-25T06:51:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	yes
2009-11-25T06:55:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	looks like you won't be able to use Audacity: http://manual.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Wma-proprietary
2009-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	I saw that too, but it specifically shows that the file is a .wav file
2009-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	I just remembered some WMAs I wanted to convert to MP3, so I'll keep looking for a solution.
2009-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	strange. :-/
2009-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	is it possible the file extension is wrong?
2009-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	hev you seen this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=37793
2009-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	kinda old, but still may work.
2009-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	I downloaded the files from a babylon 5 web site and other places and all came across as wav files and they DO PLAY in movie player - I suppose they could have been named incorrectly on the web site from which I downloaded them
2009-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	I have an mp3 which opened in audacity and I edited it to have the portion I wanted and saved the project. I then saved it as a true WAV file and HURRAY it works
2009-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	rodgerr	mac9416	so the others must have been miss named
2009-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	mac9416	rodgerr	awesome. :-D
