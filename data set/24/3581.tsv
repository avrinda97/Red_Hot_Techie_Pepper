2008-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	h40		for creating CSS
2008-03-10T14:04:00.000Z	macogw	h40	for CSS.... w3schools should have it
2008-03-10T14:04:00.000Z	macogw	h40	that's best online reference
2008-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	macogw	h40	if you'd like a recommendation for a book, Stylin' With CSS by Charles Wyke Smith is very good
2008-03-10T14:01:00.000Z	macogw	h40	whats up? im more used to xhtml these days, but sure
2008-03-10T14:01:00.000Z	macogw	h40	this isnt really the channel for this though :P
2008-03-10T14:02:00.000Z	macogw	h40	O_o hello 1990s
2008-03-10T14:02:00.000Z	macogw	h40	#html but really you should be separating style from content.  you can use an unordered list and some CSS
2008-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	macogw	h40	if you have the css in a separate file, changing just that one file can change the layout of every page on your site
2008-03-10T14:06:00.000Z	macogw	h40	you want to use images of text instead of real text?
2008-03-10T14:06:00.000Z	macogw	h40	so bad for accessibility....
2008-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	macogw	h40	if you're blind and you have a screenreader reading the text to you, the screenreader just says "there's an image"
2008-03-10T14:07:00.000Z	macogw	h40	it doesnt tell them what the text on the image says
2008-03-10T14:08:00.000Z	macogw	h40	yes, blind people use the interwebs :)
2008-03-10T14:09:00.000Z	h40	macogw	i see, great
2008-03-10T14:10:00.000Z	macogw	h40	are you getting PMs?
2008-03-10T14:10:00.000Z	macogw	h40	oh ok.
