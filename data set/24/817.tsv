2011-01-08T04:49:00.000Z	cp24eva		hey all. I'm new. How do I find the software that i downloaded through synaptic?
2011-01-08T04:50:00.000Z	cp24eva		a specific app. I downloaded conky and can't find it.
2011-01-08T04:52:00.000Z	cp24eva		nothing special, I dont see it
2011-01-08T04:53:00.000Z	cp24eva		is there a way to do like Mac OS and make all the windows show up?
2011-01-08T04:54:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	more specifically?
2011-01-08T04:54:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	Compiz can do the same thing and more. I use it myself on a regular basis as a Mac and Linux dualbooter
2011-01-08T04:55:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	like if I move the mouse to a corner of a screen and all the windows show up in equally laid out spaces
2011-01-08T04:55:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	yup, you can do EXACTLY that. sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2011-01-08T04:56:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	thanks, i'll give it a shot.
2011-01-08T04:57:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	no probs. If you have any questions about how to set it up, i'm happy to help :)
2011-01-08T04:57:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	it didn't open it up. it said: E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
2011-01-08T04:58:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	Are you installing updates or new software?
2011-01-08T04:59:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	(You can't install two programs at once)
2011-01-08T04:59:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	ah yes. lol.
2011-01-08T04:59:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	i'm doing an "apply change" and it's been taking a while.
2011-01-08T05:00:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	what are you installing/upgrading?
2011-01-08T05:00:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	I think it's a total system update
2011-01-08T05:00:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	ah yeah, if you haven't done them in a while (or ever) they can take a little while :)
2011-01-08T05:01:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	it would be a first time. I just built this PC yesterday and loaded ubuntu.
2011-01-08T05:04:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	alright, it's started. now what?
2011-01-08T05:04:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	compiz-config is?
2011-01-08T05:05:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	actually....no it isn't. lol. hold on
2011-01-08T05:05:00.000Z	cp24eva	aroman	ok i think I can handle a GUI lol. thanks again.
2011-01-08T05:06:00.000Z	aroman	cp24eva	:D yeah, the plugin you'll want to use is called "Expo", and make sure to look at "Edge bindings" (screen edges). good luck!
