2007-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	realtek 8185
2007-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	I thought realteks where reasonable supported
2007-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	but i am trying to compile drivers from realtek homepage
2007-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	is there a reason your not using the ones in the kernel (assuming its suported)
2007-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	looks like they isn`t here
2007-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	which card again, let me take a look
2007-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	I was reasonably confident realteks are well supported
2007-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	RTK8185L
2007-09-11T11:09:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	there is a binary driver for it
2007-09-11T11:10:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	what`s name for it?
2007-09-11T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	shal3r	you get it from the realtek site, but it also states that orinoco drivers should work for basic functionality
2007-09-11T11:10:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	thanks, i will try
2007-09-11T11:16:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	i modprobed all orinoco modules. What to do now?

2007-09-11T11:17:00.000Z	shal3r	ikonia	no :/
