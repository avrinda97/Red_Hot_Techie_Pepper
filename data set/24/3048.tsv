2008-05-12T18:09:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	i used the one from linuxwireless.org, not ndiswrapper (because i need monitor mode)
2008-05-12T18:09:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	then do a   ndiswrapper -l
2008-05-12T18:11:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	it doesnt list anything, not even an error
2008-05-12T18:11:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	then load the module :    sudo modprobe bcm43xx
2008-05-12T18:13:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	then  dmesg | tail
2008-05-12T18:14:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	could you pastebin it ?
2008-05-12T18:17:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	is that all you have ?
2008-05-12T18:20:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	does that say more?
2008-05-12T18:20:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	we need more output, do   dmesg | tail -n 100
2008-05-12T18:21:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	http://paste.ubuntu.com/11658/
2008-05-12T18:23:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	hmm, it says try booting with irqpoll, I guess you could try it
2008-05-12T18:24:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	in GRUB, press e twice to edit the kernel boot command
2008-05-12T18:27:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	after reboot and modprobe bcm43xx still no device in iwconfig =(
2008-05-12T18:28:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	still those message in the dmesg ?
2008-05-12T18:29:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	dmesg | tail
2008-05-12T18:31:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	wait a bit and see if you have the same messages as before appearing
2008-05-12T18:33:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	not really a wonde, Broadcom won't give out the specs of the hardware, so those drives are reverse-engineered
2008-05-12T18:36:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	yes, that should be right
2008-05-12T18:37:00.000Z	lys	HymnToLife	does that mean i'll have to use ndiswrapper again?
2008-05-12T18:38:00.000Z	HymnToLife	lys	I guess so, or gat another wifi adapter made by a nicer company
