2008-09-27T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	you really only need the directories that you have modified.  Which is most likely just /home and /etc.  Maybe /var too if you are running some services.  Then use !clone to get the same packages
2008-09-27T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	sufficient for what?
2008-09-27T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	Like I said, those two directories and any other directory where you have created data is sufficient if you also use !clone.  I'm not sure why it matters if gnome or compiz crash though.  You just reboot if they crash
2008-09-27T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	completely dependent on the game binary
2009-07-24T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	remove the corresponding linux-image-* package
2009-07-24T17:55:00.000Z	ganesh	jrib	not shown synaptic package
2009-07-24T17:55:00.000Z	ganesh	jrib	not shown synaptic package in 14 version
2009-07-24T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	how did you install it?
2009-07-24T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	do you have a separate /boot partition?
2009-07-24T17:57:00.000Z	ganesh	jrib	yeah
2009-07-24T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	then just delete it manually
2009-07-24T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	*carefully* and update your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-24T17:57:00.000Z	ganesh	jrib	how to delete manually
2009-07-24T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	same way you delete any other file.  If you don't know this, you probably should just leave it alone.  Just don't boot the kernel or remove the entry from the grub menu
2009-07-24T17:59:00.000Z	ganesh	jrib	next?
2009-07-24T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	ganesh	that's it
