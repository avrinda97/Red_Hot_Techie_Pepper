2009-05-01T22:50:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	It is wired.
2009-05-01T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jingcheng	are the activity lights flashing on each side of the connection?
2009-05-01T22:51:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	the lights do not seem toe be flashing, but a constant green.
2009-05-01T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		green means connected, they need to flash too, try a different port
2009-05-01T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jingcheng	is the cable known to be ok? do you get dhcp? is the interface down or up?
2009-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	I do not seem to be connected to the router at all. When running the install, it set up DHCP automatically, suggesting that the cable is okay.

2009-05-01T22:56:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	Connection timed out. No servers could be reached.
2009-05-01T22:58:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	Could it be so that the network card isn't mounted correctly or something?
2009-05-01T22:59:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	I am practically not connected to any network, what so ever.
2009-05-01T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jingcheng	as long as it has the correct driver associated (sudo lshw -C network) and is up then it should be ok. Check the lshw output to make sure its correct online
2009-05-01T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jingcheng	well you can use the output to websearch at some point
2009-05-01T23:00:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	ok
2009-05-01T23:01:00.000Z	Jingcheng	ActionParsnip	say that you got a new network card, how would you configure it to make it work?
