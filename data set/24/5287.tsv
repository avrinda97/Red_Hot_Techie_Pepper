2006-09-27T15:26:00.000Z	lemino		anyone who knows about this problem?
2006-09-27T15:26:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	turn off your speakers?
2006-09-27T15:27:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	mine have a power switch as most of them usually do
2006-09-27T15:29:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	hmmm.... that doesn't sound like a easy solution.
2006-09-27T15:29:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	lol... omg... because turning of the power switch on your speakers is *sooooo* hard
2006-09-27T15:30:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	when I mute the master, everything goes silent, just as it's supposed. but when I lower the master to 0, I still hear the music.
2006-09-27T15:30:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	so where's the problem
2006-09-27T15:31:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	that the music don't go completely silent when I lower the master to 0. as I see it that should be the same as muting it.
2006-09-27T15:31:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	so where is the *problem*
2006-09-27T15:32:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	well, I would like to be able to controll the volume, that's all.
2006-09-27T15:32:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	if you want your volume level to be zero, why would you want to have the empty speaker his in your face anyway?
2006-09-27T15:32:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	you *can* control the volume
2006-09-27T15:33:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	well, do you have any idea on how I could get what I want? from my understanding this isn't the way it works normally.
2006-09-27T15:34:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	no i don't know how you can get what you want, but i do know that you should (theoretically) be capable of modifying the "way you just absolutely MUST understand things for your universe to stay intact"
2006-09-27T15:35:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	in the world of computers, there is *never* a right solution, only many non-optimal solutions from which you must choose and or combine the lesser of the non-omptimal
2006-09-27T15:36:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	the behavior you want is already defined... it's called *turning off your speakers"
2006-09-27T15:36:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	if you can't figure that out, i can't help you
2006-09-27T15:37:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	so you mean, that if you your normal stereo at home still poured out a little music when you had lowered the volume to 0, you would just be satisfied and turn it completely off (if you wanted it to be silent for a minute or two)?
2006-09-27T15:38:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	if i wanted no more sound, i would, indeed, turn it off, not down
2006-09-27T15:39:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	if i wanted to pause my music, i would in fact, hit the pause button on my media player, rather than turning my volume down <- appropriate action for the appropriate task
2006-09-27T15:40:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	I admit this isn't that big of a problem but I still can't let go of the thought that something isn't working exactly as it should.
2006-09-27T15:40:00.000Z	lemino	jazzrocker	are you telling me that your system behaves the sam way as mine?
2006-09-27T15:42:00.000Z	jazzrocker	lemino	i don't know, i've never thought about it or cared... when i want zero volume, i simply turn my speakers off
