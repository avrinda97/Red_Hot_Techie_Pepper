2012-04-07T20:24:00.000Z	ubunt231		?

2012-04-07T20:25:00.000Z	ubunt231		i restart the system of course
2012-04-07T20:25:00.000Z	ubunt231		i think that i formatted a wrong partition
2012-04-07T20:26:00.000Z	ubunt231		but the parttion wich contains my data on windows c: is intact just i can't start windows
2012-04-07T20:26:00.000Z	ubunt231		even ubuntu
2012-04-07T20:27:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	what actually happens when you boot
2012-04-07T20:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	windows going into recovery mode has nothing to do with ubuntu, if it finds windows then ubuntu has done its job properly
2012-04-07T20:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	what happens when you try to boot ubuntu?
2012-04-07T20:32:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	if you didn't install ubuntu nothing happened, so why are you asking here?
2012-04-07T20:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	during the install process you'll need to repartition
2012-04-07T20:40:00.000Z	ubunt231	tensorpudding	wht i did is that i formatted sda4which was a fat32 partition into an ext3 and i mount it to the /
2012-04-07T20:46:00.000Z	ubunt231	tensorpudding	i'm not sure that i chose the right partition ut i'm sure that i didn't touched my c: on windows
2012-04-07T20:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	what about it?
2012-04-07T20:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	you should tell us what's on all your hard drives
2012-04-07T20:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	so we can help you decide how to partition
2012-04-07T20:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	why do you have so many partitions anyway
2012-04-07T20:58:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	what was on sda4?
2012-04-07T20:59:00.000Z	ubunt231	tensorpudding	fat32
2012-04-07T21:00:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ubunt231	why would you think that?
