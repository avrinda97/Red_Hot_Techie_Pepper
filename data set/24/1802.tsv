2009-08-17T02:28:00.000Z	_0travitu		i want to upgrade from 6.10 to 9.04.. i have 3 iso's on my computer.. i mount them, i use the upgrading command, but nothing happens. My iso's are: 7.04,8.04 and 9.04. What should I do?
2009-08-17T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	you need to use the alternate isos
2009-08-17T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	try replacing /cdrom with where you mount the iso
2009-08-17T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	if you don't mount the iso to /cdrom then it won't work
2009-08-17T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	its wherever you mount it. you could have mounted it literally anywhere so there is no definitive answer
2009-08-17T02:33:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	i  do this: < mount -o loop iso_location /media/cdrom0 > then <gksu "sh /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade" >
2009-08-17T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	i hope you didnt literally type iso_location. did you?
2009-08-17T02:34:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	 no .. of course not :P
2009-08-17T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	good. well if you mount the iso to /media/cdrom0 you should be able to check it exists if you browse to the folder and view the contents
2009-08-17T02:36:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	 i am able to do that.. i can browse the files
2009-08-17T02:36:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	it actually get's me an icon on the desktop that i double click
2009-08-17T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	ok cool then use terminal to cd to the location of the file you need to launch instead of specifying the absolute locations
2009-08-17T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	you can then use: gksudo ./upgrade   or whatever it is
2009-08-17T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	it is not possible to do this with the desktop iso. it MUST be the alternative iso
2009-08-17T02:39:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	 what do you mean by alternative iso ?
2009-08-17T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	there is a live desktop cd and the alternative that installs in a text based environment and is much faster
2009-08-17T02:41:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	and where can i find those alternative iso's ?
2009-08-17T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	the upgrade documentation clearly states you need the alternate iso to upgrade offline. you cannot doo it if the isos you have are the live desktop ones
2009-08-17T02:42:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	thank you.. i'll go on the website to check it out
2009-08-17T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	thought you had the desktop ones. everyone does it once
2009-08-17T03:04:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	can i upgrade using alternate cd's from 6.10 edgy to 8.04 hardy ?
2009-08-17T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_0travitu	you will need to upgrade to the next release up. you cant jump
2009-08-17T03:05:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	i can't find 7.04 :( altenate cd
2009-08-17T03:08:00.000Z	_0travitu	ActionParsnip	 found it thank you :)
