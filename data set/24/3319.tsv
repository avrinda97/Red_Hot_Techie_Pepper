2008-02-25T03:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]		I have a bunch of server blades here, no cdrom drive available.. my options are USB or PXE.. what's the easiest option to get ubuntu on them?
2008-02-25T03:37:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	iom usb
2008-02-25T03:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	hischild	ubotu hasn't said anything.. got a URL? can I just chuck the ISO onto my USB drive somehow?
2008-02-25T03:38:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	 stupid bot ... i'll look, a second

2008-02-25T03:40:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	you seen that link?
2008-02-25T03:40:00.000Z	zcat[1]	hischild	reading it now..
2008-02-25T03:40:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	good :-)
2008-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	youtube has rickrolled a lot of ppl today
2008-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	here's the solution:
2008-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	open up that page, open up a new page, THEN kill firefox.
2008-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	as in: open ff twice
2008-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	hischild	you can't open a new page, it constantly pops a javascript dialog up so you can't do anything else
2008-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	alt f2 firefox && firefox
2008-04-01T13:21:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	^
2008-04-01T13:40:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	ubotu and ubotwo are dead :(
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	orly?
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	hischild	you know one that does?
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	not really
2008-08-24T11:53:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	truecrypt with a fat or ntfs partition in it will work.
2008-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	hischild	cool. just installing easycrypt now.. I figured out how to set up luks but I don't think windows will recognise that (I don't have windows to test either.. will have to set up something for that next)
2008-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	i've used truecrypt with succes in the past so i know it works.
2008-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	anyway good luck :)
2008-08-24T11:56:00.000Z	hischild	zcat[1]	no you have to get it from their site.
