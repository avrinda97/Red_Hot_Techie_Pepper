2010-03-13T08:19:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	good point
2010-03-13T08:20:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	my mistake
2011-03-16T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	No. And it's not generally a good idea to use --force-yes or to try to ignore dependencies. What are you trying to accomplish?
2011-03-16T02:49:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	install a package that says   creepy: Depends: python (< 2.6) but 2.6.2-0ubuntu1 is to be installed, even though both python 2.5 and python 2.6 are installed
2011-03-16T02:50:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	and its dependency line looks like this:  Depends: python (>= 2.5), python (<< 2.6), python-support (>= 0.7.1), osm-gps-map, python-simplejson, python-osmgpsmap (>= 0.7), python-beautifulsoup, python-pyexiv2, python-configobj, python-setuptools
2011-03-16T02:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	What is creepy?
2011-03-16T02:51:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	http://freshmeat.net/projects/creepy
2011-03-16T02:51:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	A research tool
2011-03-16T02:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	I just tried adding the ppa on my 10.10 system and installing creepy has no dependency problem here.
2011-03-16T02:54:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	yeah...trying to install it on 9.04 here
2011-03-16T02:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	9.04 is no longer supported.
2011-03-16T02:54:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	yeah...everyone keeps telling me that
2011-03-16T02:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	That's because 1: You shouldn't be running an OS without security updates and 2: "No longer supported" means that we don't support it.
2011-03-16T02:56:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	w/o security updates is relative, considering it's on a closed network, without internet
2011-03-16T02:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	Why are you using 9.04 still?
2011-03-16T02:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	That still doesn't change point #2. We don't support unsupported releases.
2011-03-16T02:56:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	because the platform is stable on 9.04, and we haven't worked the kinks out of 10.04 yet
2011-03-16T02:57:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	there's a few kinks with plymouth, gdm/xdm and 10.04 for our autoinstaller for pxeboot-based installs
2011-03-16T02:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	If you want to use 9.04 you're on your own. We can probably help you with getting the kinks worked out with 10.04 though.
2011-03-16T02:58:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	yeah...unfortunately i'm not the one that gets to triage what's important and what's not for our product lifecycle
2011-03-16T02:58:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	upgrading to 10.04 is important, but it's about 30 tasks down from the top of the mole hill right now
2011-03-16T02:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dlynes	Unfortunately your corporate policies do not change this channel's policies. We do not support 9.04 here. Period.
2011-03-16T03:00:00.000Z	dlynes	Jordan_U	ah...thought that was just a ubuntu policy, not necessarily a channel policy
