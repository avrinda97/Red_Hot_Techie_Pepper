2009-11-23T01:52:00.000Z	hylian		does anyone have a command or app that cleans ubuntu's memory? (and yes it actually is neccessary, and really is a problem)
2009-11-23T01:54:00.000Z	hylian		mikechelen, my memory gets filled up by several programs, and the whole system comes to a crawl
2009-11-23T01:55:00.000Z	hylian		gunthbert, thanhk you for helping me, but it IS needed. this system goes from a 4.8ghz dual core with 4 gigs of ram, to my 486 whenever i use 3 heavy hitters ram wise...
2009-11-23T01:57:00.000Z	hylian		mikechelen, i do close the programs, but my memory stays full, and my system stays ridiulously slow

2010-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	does the music player show up as a mass storage device in Xubuntu?
2010-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	some do some dont. thats why i suggested rhapsody because it "sync's" well with most players, including sansa. mine is just a big flash hard drive, so i can just drag and drop
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	sorry, i see rayvhen was asking
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	no problem. i just log in now and then to try and help people.
2010-04-19T09:13:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	is rhapsody gnome only?
2010-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	i don;t know. i'ver never used it.
2010-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	really? it's my favorite music player for ubuntu.
2010-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	nothing from Real will ever touch my system.
2010-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	i goofed up not rhapsody, rhythymbox. i am such a moron.
2012-03-28T19:30:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	i have messed with claws mail a while back, is claws and entire window manager or desktop environment? and if so is it based off of xfce, lxde or openbox?
2012-03-28T19:30:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	dist-upgrade, or getting a new release version?
2012-03-28T19:31:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	Claws uses GTK2
2012-03-28T19:32:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	so claws is a wm or de? i thought it was just claws mail, which looked a little too much like sylpheed's big brother for me.
2012-03-28T19:32:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	it's an e-mail client. it is built using the GTK2 ttoolkit.
2012-03-28T19:33:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	ohh, i see. somehow i thought maybe it was a window manager named claws, and claws mail was part of the package, my bad.
2012-03-28T19:35:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	the Claws website has all the info you need or want on the history and such of the project.
2012-03-28T19:35:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	thanks!
2012-03-28T19:35:00.000Z	mneptok	hylian	go and see how your sensation of deja vu WRT Sylpheed is not in error. :)
2012-03-28T19:38:00.000Z	hylian	mneptok	have you ever had a window just up and dissappear for no reason at all? i was using update manager to do a dist-upgrade, and all of a sudden my window went poof. should have done this in cli, now i have no idea what is going on...
