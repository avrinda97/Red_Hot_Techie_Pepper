2009-11-21T10:58:00.000Z	dav		problem: when i log into gnome, the window manager no longer starts (I was using compiz and doesn't work with metacity either). There's no window decoration, and I have to start the window manager manually. Any pointers as to where the problem might be?
2009-11-21T10:58:00.000Z	soreau	dav	What do you want as default?
2009-11-21T10:58:00.000Z	dav	soreau	compiz
2009-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	soreau	dav	Then you should set Sys>Prefs>Appearance>Visual Effects to Extra
2009-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	dav	soreau	already done. multiple times. still doesn't start on login.
2009-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	dav	soreau	(it works fine until I log out though)
2009-11-21T10:59:00.000Z	soreau	dav	How are you starting it manually?
2009-11-21T11:00:00.000Z	dav	soreau	basically by doing just what you describe. the window decorations appear, i can work, but when I log out and log back in, no more window manager.
2009-11-21T11:00:00.000Z	soreau	dav	How are you starting compiz manually?
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	dav	soreau	by choosing extra
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	dav	soreau	that starts it
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	dav	soreau	i think just calling compiz from the terminal might work too
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	dav	soreau	calling metacity definitely did work..
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	soreau	dav	Do you have compiz or fusion-icon in Sys>Prefs>Startup apps?
2009-11-21T11:02:00.000Z	dav	soreau	nope.
2009-11-21T11:03:00.000Z	soreau	dav	When you log in and look at the visual effects radio buttons, what is it set to?
2009-11-21T11:03:00.000Z	dav	soreau	none
2009-11-21T11:03:00.000Z	dav	soreau	(and metacity isn't running either: no window manager)
2009-11-21T11:04:00.000Z	soreau	dav	My best guess is you have permission issues in ~/ ($HOME)
2009-11-21T11:04:00.000Z	dav	soreau	didn't touch any of that recently - should i have compiz in startup?
2009-11-21T11:04:00.000Z	soreau	dav	You could try to work around it by putting compiz in startup
2009-11-21T11:06:00.000Z	dav		k let me try that
2009-11-21T11:06:00.000Z	dav	soreau	not very elegant but it works. thank you.
