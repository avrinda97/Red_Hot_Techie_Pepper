2009-11-23T04:21:00.000Z	gluxon		Can anybody explain what was the problem?
2009-11-23T04:22:00.000Z	gluxon		Installing, copying files.
2009-11-23T04:22:00.000Z	gluxon		at about 32%
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		Using ubuntu 8.10.
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		I know I should have used 9.10
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		but I didn't have that in range.
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		And figured I'd just update once it's installed.
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	gluxon		Yeah.
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	gluxon		I'm out of CD's :(
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	gluxon		And I don't think I can get more :(
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	got a flashdrive?
2009-11-23T04:21:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Did you verify the CD?
2009-11-23T04:21:00.000Z	gluxon	linuxguy2009	Yeah.
2009-11-23T04:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	What part of the install process did you get the error? partitioning, copying of files, cleaning up at the end etc?
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Hmm I had nothing but trouble with 8.10 release.
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Use 9.10 or even more reliable is the 8.04.3 LTS release.
2009-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	unetbootin it.
2009-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Why the frown whats wrong now?
2009-11-23T04:27:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Use unetbootin to copy the ISO to the flashdrive. Boot the flashdrive and try to install from that instead and see what happens.
2009-11-23T04:28:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Sounds like its unable to copy files. Probably due to bad burn, bad disk, dirt on surface of disk or lens.
2009-11-23T04:29:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Clean the disk and maybe use a lens cleaner.
2009-11-23T04:30:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	Do you have the CD there with you? Do a md5sum on it and paste the sum here for us to check.
2009-11-23T04:30:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	ok
2009-11-23T04:31:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	gluxon	If you burn a new one make sure to do a "md5sum /dev/cdrom" etc. Or verify boot option.
