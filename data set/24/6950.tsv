2005-06-12T11:45:00.000Z	Proteque		could it be trying to access a mirror which is down?
2005-06-12T11:45:00.000Z	Proteque		and shouldnt it timeout any time soon?
2005-06-12T11:47:00.000Z	Proteque		the installcd really should have ping :(
2005-06-12T11:48:00.000Z	Proteque		it is frustrating when things just stop without any errormsg and no tools for finding the fault.
2005-06-12T11:49:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	there are some slow mirrors today
2005-06-12T11:50:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	okay.
2005-06-12T11:50:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	but what about timeout?
2005-06-12T11:51:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	now thats a good question
2005-07-11T08:15:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	most ppl if they have ppc at least :D
2005-07-11T08:16:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	yes, they might, but the ubuntuguide doesnt say "this doesnt work for ppc", it just instructs
2005-07-11T08:17:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	are you an advanced linux user?
2005-07-11T08:17:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	would say so. has worked with it for about 6 years now.
2005-07-11T08:18:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	then you know more than the guide offers
2005-07-11T08:19:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	the 'guide is a load of <whatever sucks>, esp for brand new users
2005-07-11T08:22:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	sound on hoary is kinda screwed, so the answer is yes and no
2005-07-11T13:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	patience
2005-07-11T13:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	in laptops, sleep is the big thing (both x86 and PPC)
2005-07-11T13:03:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	nope. work great on my ibook (not ubuntu though hehe)
2005-07-11T13:03:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	so there is no way to make it sleep and wake as the status is now?
2005-07-11T13:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	correct NOT ubuntu (ydl worked great on my iBook, too, but <shudder> i just can't handle RPMs)
2005-07-11T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	not at this time, to my knowledge
2005-07-11T13:04:00.000Z	Proteque	nalioth	okay. (this is x86)
2005-07-11T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	you might check the wiki, for x86
2005-10-18T12:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Proteque	yes you can. see /topic
