2006-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	ok im in the chmod 700 /usr machine
2006-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	whoa, is it just it?
2006-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	and I'm not sure...
2006-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	done already of course with sudo /D
2006-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	ok trying reboot
2006-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	brb
2006-08-17T08:21:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	hello. It didnt work prolly because it didnt mount my filesystem. It is the livecd system that is loaded
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	what do you mean by that?
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	are you back on the live cd, or have you realised what you needed to do? and fixed it?
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	I did the chmod etc but it didnt work. When I boot with the file cd, my home directory is diferent for example
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	Lol...
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	I realized that I have toi chmod it back, but this is not my filesystem
2006-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	I have to mount it ro something, im looking for it right now
2006-08-17T08:24:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	do this: 'sudo mount /dev/<your drive> /mnt'
2006-08-17T08:24:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	after that, you do 'sudo chmod 777 /mnt/etc'
2006-08-17T08:25:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	it is prolly the right thing now, ty
2006-08-17T08:25:00.000Z	Captain_Fleming	xiko1	:)
2006-08-17T08:25:00.000Z	xiko1	Captain_Fleming	rebooting and testing again
