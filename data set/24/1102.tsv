2011-06-01T22:33:00.000Z	d3ngar_		Hi there! I seem to have messed up my GNOME on 11.04
2011-06-01T22:33:00.000Z	d3ngar_		I tried to install GNOME 3, but now I can't log-in at all anymore
2011-06-01T22:33:00.000Z	d3ngar_		Basically the screen stays where it is
2011-06-01T22:33:00.000Z	d3ngar_		Instead of loading GNOME, it just hangs
2011-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	d3ngar_		dr_Willis: thanks for the advise
2011-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	d3ngar_		I do still have Unity, but it's not loading, nor is gnome3
2011-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	d3ngar_		should I try KDE?
2011-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	d3ngar_		And how do i install KDE/
2011-06-01T22:35:00.000Z	d3ngar_		And how do i install KDE?
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	d3ngar_	you installed gnome 3 on 11.04? that probably broke unity
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	d3ngar_	and there is no way to fix it
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	d3ngar_		It must be able to get fixed
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	d3ngar_		That unity stuff is horrible
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	d3ngar_	you can't safely downgrade packages
2011-06-01T22:36:00.000Z	d3ngar_		yeah
2011-06-01T22:37:00.000Z	d3ngar_		I thought I try it
2011-06-01T22:37:00.000Z	d3ngar_		But it worked briefly
2011-06-01T22:37:00.000Z	d3ngar_		So I try LXDE
2011-06-01T22:38:00.000Z	d3ngar_	Dr_Willis	Could gdm be the issue?
2011-06-01T22:38:00.000Z	d3ngar_		I have installed GDM, but I undestand it doesn't use this anymore
2011-06-01T22:40:00.000Z	d3ngar_		How could I restore the Unity desktop?
2011-06-01T22:40:00.000Z	d3ngar_		if I remove the meta package ubuntu-desktop could I just reinstall it?
2011-06-01T22:41:00.000Z	d3ngar_		:(
2011-06-01T22:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	d3ngar_	reinstall
