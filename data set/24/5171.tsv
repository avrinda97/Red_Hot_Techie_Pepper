2007-07-11T09:37:00.000Z	lite-X		hello to the great world i have this problem i am new to ubuntu i got window xp on this system but i want 2 O/S on this computer but when i try to install it dont give me my h/d names it gives some other names and also it giv me a root problem
2007-07-11T09:38:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Like, instead of making equal partitions of 40GB each, make one of them 39?
2007-07-11T09:39:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Then there you go.
2007-07-11T09:39:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 What is the problem then?
2007-07-11T09:39:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 The root problem can be fixed by mounting to "/" rather than "/mount/hda1", etc.
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Also, change it to file type Ext2 or Ext3.
2007-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Or FATxx, but not NTFS.
2007-07-11T09:41:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Are you talking about the root problem during the Feisty Fawn install from the Live CD?
2007-07-11T09:41:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Or are you talking about a root (superuser) problem?
2007-07-11T09:42:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Right.  Okay, when you double-click on the drive you want to install to, one of the input boxes will say "/mount/something".  Change it to "/" and that solves it.
2007-07-11T09:43:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 I had the same problem.  It seemed weird too.  During install it will add "/target" to your screen.
2007-07-11T09:43:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 your dual-boot will work properly because GRUB will load with an "other operating system" option which will then go to your previous OS or boot loader
2007-07-11T09:43:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 BTW, I assume you're doing manual partitioning, right? :)
2007-07-11T09:44:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Try that.  change the "/mount/sda1" or whatever it is to just "/"
2007-07-11T09:44:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Also, make sure it's not NTFS.
2007-07-11T09:44:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 Also, I did not setup a swap file for my system.  It works just fine without one.
2007-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 I have 2 GB of memory, but Ubuntu has never taken more than a few hundred MB.
2007-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 I installed it after it loads fromt he live CD.
2007-07-11T09:45:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 np
2007-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 I haven't tried that way.
2007-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 The GUI for double-clicking the install icon was very straight-forward.
2007-07-11T09:46:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 It might be worth trying it that way.
2007-07-11T09:47:00.000Z	RickH	lite-X	 np.  Good luck! :)
