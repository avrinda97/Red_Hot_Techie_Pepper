2009-07-06T22:57:00.000Z	antii		Can I use Ubuntu 8.10 livecd for backing up my files on a EXT3 drive to a NTFS drive?
2009-07-06T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	that didn't make proper sense
2009-07-06T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	it did, weird I didn't read the word backing
2009-07-06T22:57:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	:P
2009-07-06T22:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	you can copy files from Ext3 to NTFS that's easy to do
2009-07-06T22:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	as long as Windows shut down the NTFS properly
2009-07-06T22:58:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	didnt work in 7.04, just read only so trying 8.10 now
2009-07-06T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	yeah the proper  read and write NTFS support didn't come along untill 7.10
2009-07-06T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	heh :)
2009-07-06T23:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	for what?
2009-07-06T23:00:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	8.10 cd :P
2009-07-06T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	why 8.10 and not 9.04  by the way  9.04 isn't that great really,  8.10 :)   and then do another clean install once 9.10 is out so you can have full Ext4 support and by default :)
2009-07-06T23:01:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	cause i use a mac as my primary computer and need my movies and so from my ext3 drive to my htpc
2009-07-06T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	oh right
2009-07-06T23:03:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	so ntfs-3g is enabled by default? read write that is
2009-07-06T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	yep  as of  7.10
2009-07-06T23:05:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	burning now :! D:
2009-07-06T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	by the way good idea to md5sum your ISO
2009-07-06T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	download check to make sure no problems with the ISO
2009-07-06T23:06:00.000Z	antii	sebsebseb	always ^_^!
2009-07-06T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	antii	you do it?
