2010-03-20T16:29:00.000Z	AceKing		Is there a way to do an upgrade from Live CD? The reason I am asking is because my brother has 9.04 installed on his laptop. He went to start the other day and after the grub menu he just got lines across the screen and couldn't do anything. I've been working on this for 3 days
2010-03-20T16:29:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	look for a guide on Google on how to reinstall Grub from the Ubuntu live CD
2010-03-20T16:30:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	but why would I need to reinstall grub?
2010-03-20T16:32:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	it is usually the easiest solution for filesystem problems like that. What kind of errors do you see after Grub?
2010-03-20T16:33:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	no errors. You just start seeing these lines across the screen, and what looks like chinese writing across the top. I can't even Alt f2 to get a terminal
2010-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	if you think that reinstalling the grub may help I'll try it
2010-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	that doesn't sound good at all. Can you access the drives through a live CD?
2010-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	yes
2010-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	Good, then it is probably not a disk problem.
2010-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	Reinstalling Grub is probably your easiest option then, instead of tinkering with the Grub (2?) configuration files.
2010-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	I checked memory too, it's all good
2010-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	he's running 9.04 on the laptop because in 9.10 his keyboard and mouse disabled
2010-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	that is strange. You could try the 10.04 beta and see if that solves it.
2010-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	That is what I was going to do. I think I'll try reinstalling the grub first.
2010-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	Thank you for the info. That's why I love Ubuntu and this forum!
2010-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	No problem. :)
2010-03-20T16:47:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	I found a guide to reinstalling grub. One of the things I have to type in is the hard drive, but they want it like hd0,6 or whatever your hard drive is. I know it's sda4 but how do I know how to translate it to the hd0 number?
2010-03-20T16:48:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	you can see it in any partitioning tool, try gparted.
2010-03-20T16:48:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	Thanks again!
2010-03-20T16:59:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	I successfully reinstalled grub but that didn't do it. I think I'll just backup the files and do a reinstall for him.
2010-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	unfortunate. Good luck.
2010-03-20T17:01:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	it was worth a try, and at least I know how to reinstall grub if I had to : )
2010-03-20T17:02:00.000Z	orb01	AceKing	that's always good :P.
2010-03-20T17:02:00.000Z	AceKing	orb01	Thank you again for your help
