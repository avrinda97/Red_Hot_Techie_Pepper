2011-10-25T20:58:00.000Z	hrolf		Anyone else having problems with logging into reddit in Ubuntu?
2011-10-25T20:58:00.000Z	hrolf		or specifically with Firefox?
2011-10-25T20:59:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	No, what problems are you experiencing?
2011-10-25T21:00:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	It keeps loading (I can see the loading circle, it doesn't stops). Same issue with cic.gc.ca (when I access a https link)
2011-10-25T21:00:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	similarly when I open facebook I'm directed to the security page which is also a https, and keeps loading forever
2011-10-25T21:00:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	Can you access any https page?
2011-10-25T21:01:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Yes, Gmail works fine though.
2011-10-25T21:02:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	Sounds like a problem with your browser's HTTPS
2011-10-25T21:02:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	I'm using Firefox (the version which comes with Ubuntu 11.10)
2011-10-25T21:02:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	How do I go about troubleshooting it?
2011-10-25T21:03:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	Googling for something "Firefox HTTPS ubuntu problem" might help.
2011-10-25T21:06:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Nope. Couldn't get any good results. Though after like 5 minutes I'm logged in.
2011-10-25T21:07:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	I shall check the other websites too.
2011-10-25T21:07:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	It seems that your HTTPS is working fine but is _really_ slow then.
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Seems like. I should try another browser.
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	Why it would be really slow I'm having a hard time finding out though, but check the rest of the sites.
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Is there Opera for Ubuntu?
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	That might be a good idea.
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	Yes, absolutely.
2011-10-25T21:08:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	There's also Chromium
2011-10-25T21:09:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Ubuntu Software Center cannot find any Opera, strange.
2011-10-25T21:09:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	It's not there by default since it's not free software.
2011-10-25T21:10:00.000Z	joar	hrolf	http://www.opera.com/browser/download/
2011-10-25T21:12:00.000Z	hrolf	joar	Ah, I see. Thanks.
