2007-06-20T14:08:00.000Z	TheCougar		I've had a issue for a few days and not sure what I did to cause it. When I switch to my first desktop it switchs very slowly (hangs for a few seconds) when I switch to my second desktop it switchs almost instantly. what could be causing this?
2007-06-20T14:08:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	did you install compiz or beryl
2007-06-20T14:09:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	not that i know of. is there a way to easily check?
2007-06-20T14:09:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	you'd know...
2007-06-20T14:09:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	you could try making a new user account and see if it is just something with your profile
2007-06-20T14:12:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	lol any idea how to get my touch pad to work with the new user account since it seams it doesn't by default?
2007-06-20T14:12:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-06-20T14:13:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	can that be edited by a standard user? and is it different for each user?
2007-06-20T14:14:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	ummm you have to be root
2007-06-20T14:14:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	is xorg.conf different for each user? if not i'm not sure how this is going to fix it:-/
2007-06-20T14:15:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	I believe there is only one copy... but that is where your touchpad would be as a device
2007-06-20T14:15:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	well the touch pad works on my main user and is listed in xorg.conf
2007-06-20T14:15:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	ok so what is different there or how did you get it working before
2007-06-20T14:16:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	tryin something now
2007-06-20T14:17:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	try to use the new account to figure out why it's slow then go back to your main account
2007-06-20T14:19:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	can't have two users logged in at the same time (switching users) it seams and still have full capabilies
2007-06-20T14:20:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	the new users desktop works correctly
2007-06-20T14:21:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	ok then you know it is something specific to your account profile... can you get the touchpad installed on the new user?
2007-06-20T14:22:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	if i have both users logged in at the same time the touchpad won't work and when i go to switch off the other user the system locks up. I rebooted and just went into the new user account and the touch pad worked fine
2007-06-20T14:22:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	man gdm
2007-06-20T14:24:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	where is the profile for the users desktop stored? and what would I be looking for?
2007-06-20T14:24:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	I dunno maybe gconf?
2007-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	TheCougar	hwilde	found it. had desktop effects turned on. turned them off and back on and it fixed it
2007-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	hwilde	TheCougar	yeah that is beryl or compiz or something like this
