2009-02-23T03:18:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		how can I mount a dir from my Ubuntu system into Windows XP ?
2009-02-23T03:20:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		ive got another box with 8.10 (normal) running somewhere in a dark room
2009-02-23T03:20:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		did that already
2009-02-23T03:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		but, where do I go now ?
2009-02-23T03:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I want to make like 5 GB free and share that with all my housemates here
2009-02-23T03:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		they all have WinXP clients
2009-02-23T03:23:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		im working on my laptop(XP pro) right now, can I do it from within windows? or do I need to configure something in Samba?
2009-02-23T03:24:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	You'll need to configure your samba.. I mine to allow un-authenticated access, as a specific user, and set a disk quota for that user.
2009-02-23T03:24:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	MoTec	alright, I'll take a look at the documentation
2009-02-23T03:26:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	This is a good reference: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605
2009-02-23T03:26:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	it shows the samba.conf and some settings like force user = whatever, force group = whatever, etc..
2009-02-23T03:31:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	I have an ubuntu server doing just that for 5 lawyers, heh..
2009-02-23T03:32:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	check out ebox :)
2009-02-23T03:35:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	it's simple.. just read it's bottom two lines :)
2009-02-23T03:40:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	I've not seen any color in nano.. like color-coding for sourcecode
2009-02-23T03:41:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	you know about 'screen' yet?
2009-02-23T03:44:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	MoTec	yea, ive played with screen before
2009-02-23T03:45:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	MoTec	only used irssi in screen though
2009-02-23T03:53:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	top
2009-02-23T03:55:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	ps -ef | grep Whatever
2009-02-23T03:59:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	You're welcome... And I'm using irssi in screen right now :)
2009-02-23T04:00:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	you can filter out the grep itself by doing: ps -ef | grep -v | grep whatever
2009-02-23T04:01:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	hmm, forget what I said.. it doesn't work for me :)
2009-02-23T05:39:00.000Z	MoTec	Iceman_B^Ltop	it holds initilization scripts
