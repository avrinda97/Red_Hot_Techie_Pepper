2009-07-30T09:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2009-07-30T09:44:00.000Z	Ziber	DasEi	but, i cant use apt-get if i dont have internet
2009-07-30T09:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	sorry, my fault, paste the out from ifconfig then
2009-07-30T09:44:00.000Z	Ziber	DasEi	i tried setting a static LAN ip, that i know was not in use, and i was still unable to ping my router.
2009-07-30T09:46:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	right IP/netmask ? where did you set it up ?
2009-07-30T09:48:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	are you chatting over this router now ? in which os ?
2009-07-30T09:48:00.000Z	Ziber	DasEi	I'm using windows xp atm, which has internet fine
2009-07-30T09:49:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	I see, did you install with the desktop live cd ?
2009-07-30T09:52:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	boot into live then, copy the /etc/network/interfaces to an external medium, and try with that; also on the hd~8.10 there is the option safe-mode >> netroot, which mostly autoconfigures dhcp fine, so can look for interfaces there again
2009-07-30T09:56:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	did you try the live and did it connect to your router ?
2009-12-07T20:18:00.000Z	DasEi	Ziber	sudo dpkg-reconfigure
