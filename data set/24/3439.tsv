2008-01-18T12:37:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	you know how to set up a partition in addition to your windows partition?
2008-01-18T12:38:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	Ubuntu has gparted which can resize the win partition during the install of ubuntu
2008-01-18T12:39:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	You have livecd yet?
2008-01-18T12:39:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	oddalot: do u mean qparted live-cd or ubuntu live-cd?
2008-01-18T12:40:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	oddalot:i've ubuntu live-cd, but not !gparted
2008-01-18T12:41:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	You have windows installed already?
2008-01-18T12:41:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	i'm sorry.. i plan to buy new windows-pc and install ubuntu..
2008-01-18T12:42:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	You want to have windows installed first... trust me
2008-01-18T12:42:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	yap!!
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	All you need is ubuntu livecd
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	ubuntu livecd has gparted
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	 Wait, you have windows installed?
2008-01-18T12:45:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	Well as soon as you install windows thats when you install ubuntu
2008-01-18T12:46:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	After windows is installed you boot to livecd ubuntu and install
2008-01-18T12:47:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	so in live-mode i click "install" and then do partition editing during installation?
2008-01-18T12:48:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	precisely
2008-01-18T12:48:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	It will guide you through
2008-01-18T12:49:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	how big is the risk?
2008-01-18T12:49:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	Yes, the only you have to watch out for is when it asks HOW you want to install and how you partition the drives (IE DO NOT install ubuntu over entire disk cause this will erase your windows partition)
2008-01-18T12:51:00.000Z	badkitty	xeek	Pay attention to what partitions it is asking to format and you will be fine. Recommend setting partitions to different space (40-60 of 100 gig for example) so you can easily ddecipher which partition it is asking about
2008-01-18T12:51:00.000Z	xeek	badkitty	thank you..
