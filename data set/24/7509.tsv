2005-06-15T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas		sudo will tell it to run with root privileges
2005-06-15T05:29:00.000Z	jind	Seveas	are there much difference in sudo -s and sudo -i?
2005-06-15T05:29:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	a lot
2005-06-15T05:30:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	always use -i unless you have a very specific reason not to
2005-06-15T05:31:00.000Z	jind	Seveas	thanks. I have always used -s. I haven't got any time to spare to read man pages. So you giving me this small explonation is appreciated
2005-06-15T05:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	you should read manpages though, never blindly trust a stranger from irc ;)
2005-06-15T05:33:00.000Z	jind	Seveas	sure. If in doubt. But I trust that sudo does not do any damage. I know the basics of couse. But if in doubt, sure.
2005-06-16T05:47:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	same thing afaik
2005-06-16T05:48:00.000Z	jind	Seveas	no. It's a difference while compiling kernel
2005-06-16T05:50:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	ah, well, centrino is the complete system and you can plug in any suitable processor, so 'centrino 1400' does not say much
2005-06-16T07:12:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	/etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2005-06-16T07:16:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	you can use both
2005-06-16T07:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	read the manpage...
2005-06-16T07:32:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	       Equivalent command using explicit argument sets:
2005-07-05T08:23:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	getting an Ubuntu system up-and-running is simply booting the install cd and following the instructions :)
2005-07-05T10:28:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	you might also be interested in BUM
2005-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	see the 3rd party projects on the forum
2006-03-21T14:46:00.000Z	Seveas	jind	access control is just file permissions
