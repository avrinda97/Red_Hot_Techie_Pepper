2008-06-22T17:35:00.000Z	milaks		anyone please?
2008-06-22T17:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	did you verify your fstab points to the correct UUID of that hda9 drive ? "sudo blkid" will give you the numbers .. if they don't match, you will have to adjust /etc/fstab (take the verify step first and we'll see what needs/can be done)
2008-06-22T17:37:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	thanks for responding. Well /etc/fstab/ is the same as before since I didnt mess with creating/deleting partitions till reboot and still not
2008-06-22T17:38:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	I'll post fstab file for trying command I need to reboot into Linux, since I cant use net there I'm in Windows now
2008-06-22T17:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	okay
2008-06-22T17:39:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	this is my /etc/fstab : http://paste.ubuntu.com/22107/
2008-06-22T17:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	i'll have a look and report back, hang on
2008-06-22T17:39:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	thanks
2008-06-22T17:42:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	looks ok (although refering to the partitons via UUID is considered a safer option) .. from what i can read in the first paste, it states that it can't find the resume image .. do you have resume=/dev/hda9 added to your kernel in grub ? check /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-22T17:44:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	I'll paste /boot/grub/menu.lst in a sec...
2008-06-22T17:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	ok, no rush
2008-06-22T17:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	ok checking ..
2008-06-22T17:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	try adding "resume=/dev/hda9" at the end of line 132, that adds the swap partition as resume location (also usefull for hibernation btw) .. you seem to have memtest as default (line 14 --> default 7) .. is this the behaviour you want ?
2008-06-22T17:50:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	default boot option is Windows atm
2008-06-22T17:50:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	I'm going to try what you proposed me about resume now, and get back to tell you results, thanks for effort glitsj
2008-06-22T17:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	line 14 oints to default 7, the entrees start counting from 0
2008-06-22T17:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	so windows is default 8 i think in your case
2008-06-22T17:52:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	no, when I reboot I get windows as default, here let me check again...
2008-06-22T17:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	correction: my mistake, it's set to boot the wiondows one indeed
2008-06-22T17:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	ok, depending on the size of your swap it could still be unable to resume the image (no clue how big that is) .. see you later
2008-06-22T18:03:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	I addedd "resume=/dev/hda9" but it's the same... should I try making root to point to real root partition and not to swap?
2008-06-22T18:03:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	/var is on root partition, so maybe that "resume image" is on it
2008-06-22T18:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	milaks	that's worth a try yes
2008-06-22T18:04:00.000Z	milaks	glitsj16	thanks glitsj16
