2008-03-02T05:26:00.000Z	johnny2008		I am booting Ubuntu from my external USB HDD.  But there is another partition on that same USB external HDD that contains WIndows!  Can I tell GRUB to give me option to boot Windows from my external HDD?

2008-03-02T05:27:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	I already tried :(
2008-03-02T05:28:00.000Z	johnny2008	Odd-rationale	I have it installed
2008-03-02T05:28:00.000Z	johnny2008	Odd-rationale	pls dont troll and dont give false information.   I have Windows Vista successfully installed on my external USB HDD!  And it begins to load, but stops after 2mins and reboots PC
2008-03-02T05:28:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	How did you let the installer do it?
2008-03-02T05:29:00.000Z	johnny2008	Odd-rationale	I made a backup image of C: using Acronis Trueimage, then restored that same image to my E: external USB HDD!

2008-03-02T05:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	I tried installing vista on my external hdd and the installer said that installing on external hdd is not supported... I haven't tried what you did, so I don't know.
2008-03-02T05:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	I wasn't trying to troll, I was just trying to give you information from my expereince....
2008-03-02T05:32:00.000Z	johnny2008	Odd-rationale	why does Ubuntu load ok from my external USB HDD?
2008-03-02T05:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	Becuase linux has a totally different way of dealing with drives. mounting. When you mount a drive/partition linux doesn't care whether it is internal or externa;
2008-03-02T05:34:00.000Z	johnny2008	Odd-rationale	OK gotcha
2008-03-02T05:34:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	johnny2008	The mounted drive becomes part of the filesytem (/)
