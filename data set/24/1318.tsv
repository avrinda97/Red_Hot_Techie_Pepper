2010-03-17T12:53:00.000Z	Jon-also		Come on guys, I know it's relatively easy to add keys I just don't know how... =/
2010-03-17T12:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	you're using a lot of ppa's
2010-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	A few
2010-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	if you're new - I would very strongly advice against using PPA's
2010-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	A few packages I installed had me add them, things like Tor, etc. Why shouldn't I use them?
2010-03-17T12:55:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Those are the total number of PPAs from my other system. I have configured zero on this one thusfar.
2010-03-17T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	because they are totally unsupported and normally a pet project for "someone" so there is questionable compatability/stability,
2010-03-17T12:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	you need to contact the PPA owners to get the keys (this is an example of the lack of support)
2010-03-17T12:55:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Ok I'll try to install what I need and see what blows up. I am cloning packages from one machine to another basically
2010-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	the repo is in your list
2010-03-17T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	you need to contact the repo owners for the key
2010-03-17T13:00:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Are you serious? I can't just copy it from one to another? I don't recall which PPAs are for which applications, I am just trying to clone packages from one to another.
2010-03-17T13:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	keep in mind if the keys are no longer publicly available there may be a problem with the ppa's now, so I would contact the owners to find out what's happened
2010-03-17T13:01:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Everything works fine on laptop. I want same packages on this computer. So... copy sources, follow !clone instructions, only step left: those sources that require keys. I have keys on computer A, need them on computer B. No straight copy?
2010-03-17T13:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	wgrant told you the key file, and I'm advising you to contact the owners as if the keys are no longer available that may suggest there is something wrong with those PPA's now, eg: they are no longer valid
2010-03-17T13:09:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Is this file meant to be encryped?
2010-03-17T13:09:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	Is this file meant to be encrypted?
2010-03-17T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Jon-also	I thought it just contained the key strings
2010-03-17T13:10:00.000Z	Jon-also	ikonia	vim has garbage, gedit reports encrypted
