2012-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	djcobra		but having trouble when i'm in windows
2012-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	djcobra		i believe i have both ssh and sshd installed
2012-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	djcobra		yep
2012-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	can you ping the system?
2012-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	are you connecting with an account on the allowed list?
2012-01-24T08:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	if its on the LAN the forwarding won't matter
2012-01-24T08:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	each PC on the network will have a different IP
2012-01-24T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	check the port forwarding in the router, you need to forward port 22/TCP to the IP of the system running the SSH service
2012-01-24T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	there are websites to scan for open ports which you can use to see if it's working
2012-01-24T08:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	you may need to reboot the router too, some home grade routers need taht
2012-01-24T08:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	can you connect over LAN ok?
2012-01-24T08:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	then your issue is not the router
2012-01-24T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	is openssh-server installed on the server side?
2012-01-24T08:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2012-01-24T08:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	it'll either install or say its already in
2012-01-24T08:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	ok and what is the output of:  service ssh status
2012-01-24T08:59:00.000Z	djcobra	ActionParsnip	ssh start/running, process 26533
2012-01-24T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	ok, run:  ssh localhost     so you get offered to continue connecting (lots of output)?
2012-01-24T09:02:00.000Z	djcobra	ActionParsnip	ssh 192.168.1.100
2012-01-24T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	ok that's good, we know the service is running and accepting connections
2012-01-24T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	ok did you configure your firewall any?
2012-01-24T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	try it, can't hurt
2012-01-24T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	sudo reboot
2012-01-24T09:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djcobra	if that fails:  sudo service ssh stop; sudo service ssh start
