2012-10-16T02:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	could try using Quantal. The newer kernel and drivers may help

2012-10-16T02:42:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	the next release of Ubuntu, out soon
2012-10-16T02:42:00.000Z	wchan_	actionParsnip	so you mean skip 12.04?
2012-10-16T02:42:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	why not, as long as it's a clean install you can skip releases :)
2012-10-16T02:43:00.000Z	wchan_	actionParsnip	i do development, i dont want to jump into a beta release that wont be supported in 2 months?
2012-10-16T02:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	non LTS is supported for 18 months

2012-10-16T02:51:00.000Z	wchan_	actionParsnip	originally was using the logitech USB wireless and it wouldnt even work at all without some weird unplugging replugging

2012-10-16T02:53:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	does the system have a make and model? Does the mouse have a make and model?
2012-10-16T02:55:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	worth exploring
2012-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	yes

2012-10-16T03:32:00.000Z	wchan_	actionParsnip	no. the gui screen pops up and then gets stuck
2012-10-16T03:44:00.000Z	actionParsnip	wchan_	how do you mean 'doesn't boot'?
