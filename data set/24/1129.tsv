2010-07-08T02:01:00.000Z	daichi		i would like a command to not require a password
2010-07-08T02:02:00.000Z	daichi		and i think by default, my username is in sudo group, so what do i add in the /etc/sudoers file ? >> %sudo USERNAME=NOPASSWD: a2ensite ??
2010-07-08T02:04:00.000Z	daichi		I would like to use the command "a2ensite" without password prompt.... and i think by default, my username is in sudo group, so what do i add in the /etc/sudoers file ? >> %sudo USERNAME=NOPASSWD: a2ensite ??
2010-07-08T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	« man sudoers » should have examples.  Make sure you use visudo to edit.
2010-07-08T02:05:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	i tried an example from man sudoers -- didn't work... i got an error
2010-07-08T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	what did you try exactly?  What error did you get?
2010-07-08T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	what did you actually type in sudoers?
2010-07-08T02:07:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	"daichi  shizen=NOPASSWD: a2ensite"
2010-07-08T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	what you said should work, you should probably give full path though.  What was the actual error
2010-07-08T02:10:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	syntax error
2010-07-08T02:10:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	that my sudoers file is broken on line 31
2010-07-08T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	only thing I do differently is surround the = with spaces, but I'm not sure that is significant
2010-07-08T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	which a2ensite
2010-07-08T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	sudo visudo    How are you getting syntax errors if you aren't using visudo?
2010-07-08T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	no, just what I wrote
2010-07-08T02:22:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	i did as you said... i tried running my script with the command... i get the permission denied error
2010-07-08T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	this isn't what I said
2010-07-08T02:37:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	"daichi ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/a2ensite" works perfectly well... but everytime I use sudo... no matter what command... it just passes through. I want sudo to prompt for password on every command (default) except 'a2ensite'
2010-07-08T02:37:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	pastebin your /etc/sudoers
2010-07-08T02:39:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	http://pastebin.com/3WZHrU6d -- line 31
2010-07-08T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	sudo caches your password by default for a few minutes.  Are you sure that's not what you are experiencing?  Try « sudo -k » and then sudo your_command_that_should_prompt_for_a_passowrd
2010-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	daichi	jrib	you were right :P
2010-07-08T03:05:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	seems like it tells you the problem
2010-07-08T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	daichi	ask #httpd
