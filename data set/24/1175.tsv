2012-09-29T04:13:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		Does anyone have experience installing BURG over GRUB on a system that dual-boots 12.04 and Windows?
2012-09-29T04:14:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	Yes. What would you like to know?
2012-09-29T04:14:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	[deXter]	Uh, how to install it?
2012-09-29T04:15:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		I tried doing it earlier and sudo burg-emu gave me a grub prompt
2012-09-29T04:15:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	I installed it from the PPA, along with Super Boot Manager to set it up
2012-09-29T04:15:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		Seeing as how I'm an ubu-noob, care to walk me through that?
2012-09-29T04:16:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	One sec

2012-09-29T04:19:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	[deXter]	I still get a grub prompt when I do burg-emu
2012-09-29T04:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	did you follow all the steps in the article?
2012-09-29T04:21:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		added the PPA (well, I did earlier), updated, installed (both were already installed), installed to /dev/sda, no errors reported

2012-09-29T04:23:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	that's BURG not GRUB
2012-09-29T04:23:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	[deXter]	yes, but shouldn't I be seeing a visual window?
2012-09-29T04:23:00.000Z	[deXter]		Just use SBM to finish the installation and choose a theme
2012-09-29T04:23:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	you haven't finished installing it yet
2012-09-29T04:24:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		oh.

2012-09-29T04:24:00.000Z	[deXter]	hmmwhatsthisdo	Follow the article from step 3
2012-09-29T04:24:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		well, american
2012-09-29T04:24:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		but my mom's mostly irish
2012-09-29T04:27:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	[deXter]	the repo in the latter half of step 5 is already checked and listed as being precise, should I skip it?
