2007-01-08T11:52:00.000Z	nilsl		Uhm, I tried to install quota, and did a "quotacheck -avugm" which to so long I ctrl+c it, now, I can't do a whole lot any longer. including deleting those lines I added to /etc/fstab. Any ideas? :D
2007-01-08T11:53:00.000Z	nilsl		Nobody have any ideas about what to do with my corrupt /etc/fstab? :D
2007-01-08T11:54:00.000Z	odi3	nilsl	can you just make a new one?
2007-01-08T11:54:00.000Z	nilsl	odi3	That's a thought.
2007-01-08T11:55:00.000Z	odi3	nilsl	just rename it and write a new one, if you need i can give you mine for a starting point
