2005-10-23T15:26:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	apache2
2005-10-23T15:30:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	mind if i ask you some questions on your apache2 intall in dcc chat?
2005-10-23T15:31:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	ask in here mate
2005-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	well when i goto http://apache2-server-ip/ it brings up a ftp like interface where i can click on "apache2-default" but I figured it would bring up the test page by default
2005-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	maybe there is not test page
2005-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	cd /var/www
2005-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	if i click on "apache2-default" it brings up that test page
2005-10-23T15:33:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	like i said - tell me the output of an ls in /var/www
2005-10-23T15:33:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	right
2005-10-23T15:34:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	so put an index.htm in /var/www and it will show up
2005-10-23T15:34:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	that is NOT an ftp interface
2005-10-23T15:35:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	anything i should put in the index.htm?
2005-10-23T15:36:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	just do <p>Hello world.</p>
2005-10-23T15:37:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	any way I can keep it from brining up the directory listing and just have it bring up a page
2005-10-23T15:37:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	how'd that go?
2005-10-23T15:38:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	if you put index.htm it won't bring up the dir listing
2005-10-23T15:38:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	i did that and i refreshed and now in that directory listing is apache2-default/ and index.htm
2005-10-23T15:39:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	index.html worked :) thanx man
2005-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	np
2005-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	is it a server you have apache2 running on?
2005-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	no my personal bo
2005-10-23T15:42:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	mahangu	oh, i only asked because i'm just setting up apache on my linux file server to play around with it and my sata raid card and UPS have utilities that require a gui and i used ubuntu-base and i wanted to know the best config to use to have a VNC server running with a minimal gui
2005-10-23T15:42:00.000Z	mahangu	synthetic_fenix	no im sorry, no knowledge
