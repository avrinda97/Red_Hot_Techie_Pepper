2012-05-15T13:14:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	thanks. I made NAT instead of bridge to connect Host XP to ubuntu Server on VM as externa card, Internal interface will be "internal Network"
2012-05-15T13:15:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	they say you shouldn't use double nat though
2012-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	thanks bro. I will use bridge instead
2012-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	also probably it is better to use a virtio adapter instead of the default intel emulation
2012-05-15T13:17:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	you can choose adapter type in bridge mode, vlan works too, unless you got a realtek nic on the host :)
2012-05-15T13:18:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	virutal adapter for what ? to connect to host? If to host, existing physical network adapter connecting to Internet will be separate
2012-05-15T13:18:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	in vbox settings you can choose virtual adapter type
2012-05-15T13:19:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	only for bridged
2012-05-15T13:20:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	I don't know if you can connect through internal type to the internet outside of virtual network
2012-05-15T13:21:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	I'd use two bridged adapters and do routing on the virtual machine for the internal network, i think internal adapter is internal network only
2012-05-15T13:23:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	my setup now is that Host XP(which has internet)-> NAT or bridge------> Ubuntu server on VBbox-----(Internal Network)----->Guest XP
2012-05-15T13:24:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	I'm not sure if the guest xp can connect to the internet like that? If it can, then keep internal network type for the second interface
2012-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	server on Vbox has two internfaces, one is connecting to host and the 2nd one is connecting GuestXP.
2012-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	I understand, just try it
2012-05-15T13:27:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	as far as I understand, internal network adapter in virtualbox cannot connect to real networks at all. but i am not sure
2012-05-15T13:29:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	thanks for your suggestion. I will try. but the idea is that only server should have internet
2012-05-15T13:31:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	if it doesn't work, you can still restrict internet access with doing routing and firewall on the virtual server, i am sure.
2012-05-15T13:32:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	yes. it will act as firewall also
2012-05-15T13:34:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	OK, just pointing out, never tried internal network in vbox like that
2012-05-15T13:35:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	thanks
2012-05-15T13:35:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	np
2012-05-15T13:37:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	as ubuntu server is nothing without internet, I am also trying mail server on zentyal but not ok yet.
2012-05-15T13:43:00.000Z	krababbel	linocisco	don't know mailservers really, of course internet would be nice on that :)
2012-05-15T13:44:00.000Z	linocisco	krababbel	thanks
