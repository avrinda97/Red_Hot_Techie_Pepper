2005-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	holycow		and add the correct horizontal and vertical refresh rates for your monito
2005-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	holycow		r
2005-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	holycow		you can usuallygoogle your model and make and the v and h refresh rates
2005-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	holycow		thats what determines possible refresh rates
2005-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	holycow		well, first google your monitor model and make, and find the correct vertical and horizontal refresh rates
2005-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	dantheman	holycow	i was on asking questions yesterday about dual-boot....i actually pulled it off today
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	holycow	dantheman	no kidding? congratulations :)
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		does someone know of a good guide to installing the nvidia graphics driver?
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	holycow	dantheman	how did you do it?
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		well, it was quite a process
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	holycow	dantheman	easy ... its on the ubuntu guide website
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		that involved about half a pack of cigarettes
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		and a lot of stress
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		thanks
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		when i put in the new hard drive, and installed ubuntu on it, i just wrote grub over ntldr
2005-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	dantheman		and for some reason grub would crap out
2005-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	dantheman		error 21
2005-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	dantheman		and i fiddled with some bios settings and rearranged the jumpers on the hard drives until they worked
2005-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	dantheman		and now i get the grub menu, and everything works fine
2005-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	dantheman		i'm not sure what the hubbub about a lack of gui installer is...i thought this install was a lot easier than fedora core
2005-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	dantheman		yeah, it was ridiculously easy....it just did everything for me
2005-04-25T06:55:00.000Z	dantheman		i just had to tell it to install on my other hard drive
2005-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	holycow		yeah error21 usually means it cant find the partition, usually  you just haveto point it to the right partition
2005-04-25T06:56:00.000Z	holycow	dantheman	the thing about this graphical installer is that it works on 11 architectures
