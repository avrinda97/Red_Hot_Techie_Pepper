2009-03-10T21:00:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	pastebin output of apt-get please
2009-03-10T21:01:00.000Z	MeI	LjL	to paste.ubuntu.com ?
2009-03-10T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	yes please

2009-03-10T21:09:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	sorry i forgot about you for a moment, let me look now
2009-03-10T21:09:00.000Z	MeI	LjL	ok thanks,
2009-03-10T21:10:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	ugh, according to your APT, you don't have... APT installed.
2009-03-10T21:10:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	that doesn't sound especially good.
2009-03-10T21:10:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	but then again, you *have* that stuff installed (including apt and libc6), or your system just wouldn't work and you couldn't use apt-get. so it's apt's database that's messed up. still, not good
2009-03-10T21:11:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	do you have a /var/lib/dpkg/status-old file?
2009-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	yeah, stuff probably got very corrupted then.
2009-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	no, no need. just try using it as a backup. namely, do this:    sudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status-backup  ;  sudo cp /var/lib/dpkg/status-old /var/lib/dpkg/status
2009-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	then try again using apt-get
2009-03-10T21:14:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	that's good, though i really recommend you run other stuff now to check that your system is mostly in a consistent state
2009-03-10T21:15:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	output please
2009-03-10T21:15:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	"sudo apt-get clean", then try again (but i'm starting to think your filesystem might be very corrupt)
2009-03-10T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	do you happen to have "smartmontools" already installed?
2009-03-10T21:18:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	you can't install it if apt doesn't work ;)
2009-03-10T21:19:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	the "database" (it's not really a database, just a text file, but) that contains the list of installed packages on the system
2009-03-10T21:19:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	it got corrupted, so we restored it from a backup (which is done automatically)
2009-03-10T21:20:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	let's see if apt finishes its job now, first
2009-03-10T21:21:00.000Z	LjL	MeI	can you pastebin the output it gave so far, so i can start getting an idea?
