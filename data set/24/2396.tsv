2009-01-05T17:34:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	ActionParsnip Slart I want to setup a FTP server with ONE username & password, giving access to NTFS Partition on my PC
2009-01-05T18:15:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	got any ideas on my stupid FTP problem? :)
2009-01-05T18:16:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	magicsrv	 You want to be able to access to your NTSF partition all times?
2009-01-05T18:16:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	exactly
2009-01-05T18:17:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	magicsrv	 For what purpose?
2009-01-05T18:18:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	you see... I work with very large PSD and TIFF files.... And my clients have to be able to upload graphics at all times... It's the best for me to give them an FTP Server addess with a user&pass to upload.... And I DON't want to use windows any more
2009-01-05T18:19:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	besides, I cannot risk to want from s.o. 300 miles away to send me a CD with a bugged file....
2009-01-05T18:20:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	magicsrv	 Will look it up.
2009-01-05T18:20:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	 thanks a lot!

2009-01-05T18:28:00.000Z	magicsrv	jinja-sheep	nope... not like this... I don't want to make a common dir for users around the world.... I want to setup FTP Server .... I have installed G Pro FTP Daemon AND configured it... but the guy next to me won't login... (Damn! If he won't login, how would s.o. 300 miles away?)
