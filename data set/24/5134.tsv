2007-02-15T16:41:00.000Z	vcef		I want to change default application which firefox offers me when I click on a link to pdf file and it asks wheter I want to save or open. How do I do that?
2007-02-15T16:42:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	edit>preferences and look around, I would bet it would be in the content tab
2007-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	all I've found there are settings for __automatically__ opened files. however I don't want to open them automatically, I just want another default application for it.
2007-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	filetypes
2007-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	dtto
2007-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	just rm -rf the .mozilla directory that should do it
2007-02-15T16:48:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	this is a problem that is simply a click around until you find it specific application thing, shouldn't be too hard
2007-02-15T16:49:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	you are talking about clicking a pdf in firefox and controlling what firefox does with that right?
2007-02-15T16:51:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	hard to say actually. the way firefox handles them is fine. All that bothers me is the default application which it offers
2007-02-15T16:51:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	say exactly what you are trying to do this vague stuff obviously is very unhelpful
2007-02-15T16:53:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	you see the drop down arrow
2007-02-15T16:54:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	what are you trying to change it to
2007-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	what are you trying to change it to
2007-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	now it says "Use default document viewer"
2007-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	what are you trying to change it to
2007-02-15T16:55:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	ok, put kpdf then
2007-02-15T16:56:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	navigate to /usr/bin/kpdf
2007-02-15T16:56:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	you mean, click on that dropdown arrow and locate kdpf on the disk?
2007-02-15T16:57:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	check the do this automatically?
2007-02-15T16:57:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	I don't understand
2007-02-15T16:57:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	there is a do this automatically box in that dialog, check that
2007-02-15T16:58:00.000Z	vcef	bruenig	Oh. But that would mean that everytime I click on a link to pdf file it opens in kpdf. And I don't want that.
2007-02-15T16:59:00.000Z	bruenig	vcef	if it bugged you this much (not sure how many pdfs one runs across) just symlink evince to kpdf
