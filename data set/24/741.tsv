2011-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	boota2		Oh.
2011-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	boota2		How to use this upstart shit?
2011-03-01T17:43:00.000Z	boota2		I'm not able to google any manual about new ubuntu boot proccess.
2011-03-01T17:43:00.000Z	boota2		Where should I look?
2011-03-01T17:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	that would be grub2
2011-03-01T17:44:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	i'm talking about runlevels stuff
2011-03-01T17:44:00.000Z	boota2		not about boot loader...
2011-03-01T17:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	ok well it's broken into two parts you can start at one point /etc/init.d/*  but there is also a new section I would have too lookup that involves states
2011-03-01T17:46:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	i know a little about /etc/init.d section
2011-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	but it seems, that even networking and mounting filesystems at boot is done the other way now
2011-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	boota2		i hate ubuntu
2011-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	the other section is sysV upstart
2011-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	boota2		for now
2011-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	and i don't see any documentation about it
2011-03-01T17:48:00.000Z	boota2		i'm old and stupid i guess
2011-03-01T17:52:00.000Z	boota2		I found https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto but still don't understand anything it /etc/init folder
2011-03-01T17:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	here minimal info that I have found on it so far http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1511634  seems if it's sysV it's scripts move to /etc/init/* and if it's still  the old way it's in /etc/init.d/*
2011-03-01T17:55:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	so they moved to event-based model
2011-03-01T17:55:00.000Z	boota2		hmm
2011-03-01T17:55:00.000Z	boota2		i don't think if i like it
2011-03-01T17:55:00.000Z	boota2		i think it's overcomplicated
2011-03-01T17:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	moving to event-based model at some rate yes, some still do or can run the old way
2011-03-01T17:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	boota2	well to boot faster and to use multithread capability I guess it's what most want
2011-03-01T17:58:00.000Z	boota2	sacarlson	hmm, now i see reason behing it
