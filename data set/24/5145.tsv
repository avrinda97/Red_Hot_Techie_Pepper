2010-05-31T19:20:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi All!  How do I disable the pc speakers?  There is no option for it in System>Preferences>Sound.
2010-05-31T19:21:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	setting the volume to zero doesn't make the effect you want?
2010-05-31T19:22:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	setting the volume to zero kills the volume on the external speakers as well.
2010-05-31T19:25:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	are you using headphones? What is your scenario?
2010-05-31T19:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	I have a "new" HP xw4300 workstation on which I've installed Ubuntu 9.10.  It has an internal speaker.  I've plugged in a pair of external speakers.  When I play a sound (say a music file or a movie) the sound comes out of both the PC's internal speaker and the external speakers.  The only output in the sound preferences is 'Internal Audio Analog Stereo'/
2010-05-31T19:36:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	Oh, I see. Ubuntu seems to belive there is only one speaker because it is how the audio card behaving. This is an unusual situation. I recommend you trying to ask for help at ubuntuforums.org
2010-05-31T19:38:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	That's a good clue.  Thanks.  I'll check the HP website to see if there are specific audio drivers.
2010-05-31T19:39:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	I'm quite sure they don't provide drivers for Linux. Have you googled about it? There is probably someone that is facing the same issue you are facing.
2010-05-31T19:42:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	I chose this machine specifically because linux was available on it from the manufacturer, so presumably they have drivers.  As for google, I haven't found anything yet.
2010-05-31T19:42:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	And what about ubuntuforums.org?
2010-05-31T19:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	  I may have had a few google hits in my search, but I haven't checked directly, no.
2010-05-31T19:47:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	if you find nothing that points to a solution on ubuntuforums.org, I suggest you to create a thread explaining your problem and asking for help.
2010-05-31T19:53:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	The HP website has alsa drivers for Fedora 3. Off to ubuntuforums...
2010-05-31T19:55:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	if it is availuable for Fedora, it is possible if is already working in your Ubuntu install.
2010-05-31T19:56:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	Well, the sound is "working", I just can't turn off the PC speakers by themselves.
2010-05-31T19:59:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	there are some manufacturers that release drivers for Linux but crappy ones, without working properly. Another thing to consider is that Ubuntu changed to PulseAudio. This may lead to some regressions (stuff that worked in previous versions will stop working)
2010-05-31T19:59:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	the best thing you can do at the moment is request for help at Ubuntuforums.org
2010-05-31T19:59:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	Working on that even as we speak.
2010-05-31T20:00:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	if you don't get any reply in the following week, I suggest you to file it as a bug.
2010-05-31T20:14:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	I ran a program called alsamixer.  It gave me a textUI, which had a separate control for the PC speaker.  I've now got it muted without muting the externals.
2010-05-31T20:15:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	P.S.  I found the solution on ubuntuforums.org, as you suggested.
2010-05-31T20:15:00.000Z	KurtKraut	dsnyders	is there someone already saying this works on this thread? If there isn't, it is important to you to add a comment stating the procedure works.
2010-05-31T20:16:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	The thread is two years old.
2010-05-31T20:18:00.000Z	dsnyders	KurtKraut	There are various posts up until yesterday.  Some say it works.  Some say it doesn't.
