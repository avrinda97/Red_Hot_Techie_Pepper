2012-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas		Installation of Gnome Shell Themes:
2012-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas		Backup /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme folderExtract the archive and rename gnome-shell to themeCopy this folder to /usr/share/gnome-shell/Restart Gnome Shell by hitting Alt+F2, then type 'r' and Press EnterYou can also use Gnome Tweak Tool to install directly from zip file
2012-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	just download the zip for the theme and then open it using gnomme-tweak-tool
2012-03-18T10:09:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	I can guide you through that if you would like.
2012-03-18T10:10:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	Thats just it. gnomme-tweak-tool doesn't list anything or doesn't give the option to navigate to where the theme is. Well, unless I'm using the wrong tool.
2012-03-18T10:10:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	yes please. I've been at this for well over 5 hours
2012-03-18T10:12:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	is gnome-tweak-tool the same as advance settings? Like the one shown in the link?
2012-03-18T10:13:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	yes that is correct
2012-03-18T10:13:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	sorry, the link doesn;t actually provide instructions
2012-03-18T10:14:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	I will still help you though :)
2012-03-18T10:15:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	Here is what i did. 1) In the home folder I made a folder called .themes 2) I downloaded and extracted the theme I want there. 3) I opened gnome-tweak and clicked on the themes button. I then  looked through all the pull down menus but none of the themes I downloaded where listed.
2012-03-18T10:16:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	I think that gnome-tweak simply doesn't know where to look and it doesn't give you an option to browse fo the files.
2012-03-18T10:16:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	it should give you an option, hold on
2012-03-18T10:17:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	ok. I openened gnome tweaked and clicked on themes. Whats next?
2012-03-18T10:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	now there should be a button near to the bottom, in the middle(ish) that says (none)
2012-03-18T10:21:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	Nope, there is no button labeled "NONE"
2012-03-18T10:22:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	/home/username/.themes/gs-ubuntu-ambiance-dark/gnome-shell/FILES_ARE_HERE
2012-03-18T10:24:00.000Z	hydrox24	mr_gees100_peas	OK now I know exactly what you want to do.

2012-03-18T10:25:00.000Z	mr_gees100_peas	hydrox24	I don't see my username under /home
