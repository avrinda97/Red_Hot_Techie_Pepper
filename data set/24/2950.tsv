2008-09-06T18:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 proberly optmized some stuff would be my guess. or bug/security fixs
2008-09-07T13:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 you do NOT want to use 'sudo su' :) no need for it.
2008-09-07T13:18:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	of course i want to use sudo su
2008-09-07T13:18:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	e.g. i am configuration my server
2008-09-07T13:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/05/09/a-root-shell-on-ubuntu-the-right-way/
2008-09-07T13:20:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	or i am using sudo passwd and then i am using ssh with root as in debian, suse and so on
2008-09-07T13:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 then it dosent matter what you do.. good luck
2008-09-07T13:21:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	i just dont understad why sudo su is bad and sudo -i os good
2008-09-07T13:21:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	is good
2008-09-07T13:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 go read that url, and the 10000's of threads on the  topic.
2008-09-07T13:21:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	ok, i will
2008-09-07T13:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 'sudo su  '- is redundant for the most part also..   No need to spawn an extra process or 2
2008-09-07T13:26:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	thanks for the link, now i know why mailx is not working with sudo su :)
2008-09-07T13:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 there ya go! :)
2008-09-07T13:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 its all about the 'enviroment'  :) it seems to boil down to.
2008-09-07T13:27:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	but i will still use sudo passwd and a real root-shell for my servers, i am to lazy to login as user and became root
2008-09-07T13:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	 yoru security is your business.. set root to not needing a password to login if you want.. makes no differance to me.
2008-09-07T13:28:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	so you say debian is not good for security?
2008-09-07T13:28:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	dr_willis	or any other dstribution with root-account?
2008-09-07T13:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	  go argue in the trehads and forums.. its all been rehashed over and over and over and over
2008-09-07T13:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	DIFH-iceroot	    security is a layered process. sudo adds yet another layer of protection.
