2007-09-18T10:16:00.000Z	aleka		I have an XP drive with a US adapter that I just plugged into my Feisty.. I thought it would be a plug n play... nothing happened... "sudo fdisk -l" doesn't show the new device either... what can I do?
2007-09-18T10:16:00.000Z	aleka		us adater = USB adapter **
2007-09-18T10:18:00.000Z	aleka		please help with mounting an external usb drive [ NTFS ] 
2007-09-18T10:18:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	what is the filesystem on the drive?
2007-09-18T10:19:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	NTFS.. it is my friends XP drive whose laptop died... trying to mount it here and burn some files on a CD
2007-09-18T10:20:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	you probably tried mount -t ntfs /some/dir rite?
2007-09-18T10:21:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	you probably tried mount -t ntfs /dev/sdd1 /some/dir rite?
2007-09-18T10:21:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	I was trying sudo mount /dev/sdd -t ntfs-3g /mnt
2007-09-18T10:22:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	have you tried sdd1?
2007-09-18T10:23:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	just tried it.. no luck there
2007-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	if it's a harddrive you may have better luck popin it in as a slave via ide
2007-09-18T10:27:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	you can disable UAC :)
2007-09-18T10:29:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	did your friend have encryption enabled?
2007-09-18T10:30:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	 Nope...:)
2007-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	if it IS uac causing problems you can go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and change the key EnableLUA to 0
2007-09-18T10:31:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	doesn't sound like UAC though
2007-09-18T10:32:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	 yeah.. I did try and disable UAC, and vista was complaining about not having permissions and me needing to change ownership, when I tried to change ownership, it was saying permission denied/... pretty dumb stuff.. I thought i could just mount it under ubuntu and copy her files
2007-09-18T10:33:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	I take it you are using a laptop? can't install the drive as a slave on the IDE?
2007-09-18T10:33:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	seems like any time you try to help someone, their stuff doesn't act like it should
2007-09-18T10:35:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	looks like the drive is corrupt. not dead just juggled some :)
2007-09-18T10:37:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	you could try ntfs-dos boot disk and chkdsk. ntfs-dos should have better luck finding the drive
2007-09-18T10:38:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	if it's worth putting a couple dollars into getting the data I would look at SpinRite 6
2007-09-18T10:39:00.000Z	aleka	acecase	 Thanks
2007-09-18T10:39:00.000Z	acecase	aleka	SpinRite'l cure what ales yah
