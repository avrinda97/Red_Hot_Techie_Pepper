2011-06-16T11:55:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	package i meant
2011-06-16T11:56:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	you might have to either uninstall it or reinstall if you know for sure it's the problem
2011-06-16T11:56:00.000Z	DJHenjin	Us3r_Unfriendly	i dont know what the problem is
2011-06-16T11:58:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	andycc: so when xorg starts up that is when it crashes or freezes?
2011-06-16T12:00:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	I helped a guy kinda with the same problem.  His solution was xorg wasn't configured right on his machine.  I told him to generate a xorg.conf and reboot and it worked for him.  I wonder if it's the same problem
2011-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	mount the partition, chroot into that partition, cd /etc/X11/ and sudo Xorg -configure
2011-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	how about instead of rebooting into the live cd, just reboot the machine without the Ubuntu cd and hold <shift> key while boot to get the grub screen.  see if there's a rescue option with a root shell
2011-06-16T12:07:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	it's the same thing, just on different sides of the tracks
2011-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	is there a rescue option with a root shell?
2011-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	DJHenjin	Us3r_Unfriendly	after i try this memtest, ill see, but i did not see any rescue option in grub
2011-06-16T12:14:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	does it offer a rescue in a root shell or anything like that?
2011-06-16T12:20:00.000Z	DJHenjin	Us3r_Unfriendly	go to "Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48" then hung
2011-06-16T12:23:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	did you get there yet?
2011-06-16T12:25:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	is it a brand new install?
2011-06-16T12:26:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	where'd you get the iso of it?  from ubuntu's website?
2011-06-16T12:27:00.000Z	DJHenjin	Us3r_Unfriendly	i got it from EMC2's website, its a custom install ISO for ubuntu 10.04 with EMC2 pre installed
2011-06-16T12:30:00.000Z	DJHenjin	Us3r_Unfriendly	thers only 4 options in grub, ubuntu, ubuntu recovery mode, memtest and memtest serial console
2011-06-16T12:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	DJHenjin	ubuntu recovery is what i'm trying to push you towards
