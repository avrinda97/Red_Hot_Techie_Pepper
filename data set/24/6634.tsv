2005-09-05T14:19:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		i know i'm lazy :P
2005-09-05T14:20:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		yaay
2005-09-05T14:20:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		that's why i love debian/ubuntu, and especially apt-get :P
2005-09-05T14:21:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		!call back
2005-09-05T14:21:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		one day.. i will be a pro..
2005-09-05T14:22:00.000Z	kamikazesponge		and when i do something on the prompt in windows i always type ls, so i made a batchfile named ls :P
2005-09-05T14:24:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	get cygwin for windows
2005-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	and add c:\cygwin\bin to your path, works wonders
2005-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	i gave that a try but then i decided that making a multiboot linux/windows system would save me a LOT of time and would eventually work even better..
2005-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	for the few times i'm in cmd i'll just use my beautifull ls.bat file :P
2005-09-05T14:26:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	i managed to screw up my windows install two days after I installed ubuntu two months ago, never looked back
2005-09-05T14:26:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	but you'll miss less.bat and grep.bat and many others
2005-09-05T14:26:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	heh, i'll keep windows on my system, i use photoshop a lot and i play a lot of games
2005-09-05T14:26:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	that's true
2005-09-05T14:28:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	i play both.. but mostly the newer games.. and to be honest i don't have that much faith in cedega
2005-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	battle of wesnoth? what's that? comparable to things like age of empires? (i know it's microsoft and i hope everyone can forgive me for that, but i got addicted)
2005-09-05T14:31:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	it is more like heroes of might and magic or maybe some old SSL games like battle island
2005-09-05T14:32:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	hmm... i don't like heroes of might and magic that much.. i don't have enought patience for it... i did like might & magic 7 and 8.. do you know them?
2005-09-05T14:32:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	the 3d stuff? bored me to death
2005-09-05T14:33:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	i loved them. they look like crap but the gameplay and story was fantastic imo
2005-09-05T14:33:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	and well.. i can't really call that 3d.. minesweeper looks better
2005-09-05T14:36:00.000Z	LasseL	kamikazesponge	try frozen-bubbles it is very addictive
2005-09-05T14:36:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	i know it, i had an old cd of knoppix a while ago
2005-09-05T14:36:00.000Z	kamikazesponge	LasseL	dont swear please.. winme :|
