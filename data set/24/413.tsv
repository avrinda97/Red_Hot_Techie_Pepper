2011-09-27T03:51:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	Yes, I am using 11.04.

2011-09-27T03:52:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	I'm trying to install FreeCiv and a handful of emulators that I had running under Win7.
2011-09-27T03:52:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	so you click 'install this now' and what happenes?
2011-09-27T03:52:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	I get an error message saying that there's no software by that name under any of my software sources.
2011-09-27T03:53:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	I followed step 1 to "install the playdeb package", and the Software Center says it is installed, but no joy.
2011-09-27T03:53:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	step 1 ?
2011-09-27T03:54:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	From the link. I clicked on the playdeb link.
2011-09-27T03:55:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	give me a link to step 1 please
2011-09-27T03:55:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	Okay, I got it to work for FreeCiv 2.3.0. I'm going to try some of the others and see if my problem has been resolved.
2011-09-27T03:55:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	ha, ok good :)

2011-09-27T03:57:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	Thank you for your help, even if the problem did seem to clear up on its own.
2011-09-27T03:58:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	sure :)
2011-09-27T03:58:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	Could you explain to me how to add software sources manually, in case it ever comes up again?
2011-09-27T04:07:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	ikonia is right you should not do that.  (if you did want to do it anyway you'd use sudo)
2011-09-27T04:08:00.000Z	viktyr_korimir	edbian	I haven't used a command prompt since MS-DOS. Something tells me I am in for a bit of a learning curve on this one.
2011-09-27T04:08:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	:)
2011-09-27T04:12:00.000Z	edbian	viktyr_korimir	No, mac runs on a different kernel so the binaries won't work (that's the biggest of many reasons)
