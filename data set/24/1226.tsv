2010-05-09T11:21:00.000Z	IngeniousHax		If I upgrade my Jaunty Ubuntu am I going to end up losing my added repo's?
2010-05-09T11:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	Normally not. Only if you had added very exotic repositories which Ubuntu does not take care of.
2010-05-09T11:22:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	I added repos based on ubuntu, but not directly built by such.
2010-05-09T11:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	So you will not loose them.
2010-05-09T11:23:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Nice, thanks. Also was wondering if you might be able to take a gander at an error im receiving on trying to DL packages from console?
2010-05-09T11:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	A 'gander' is a bird. I do not know what you mean. Can you say it in other words, please.
2010-05-09T11:26:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Could you take a look at the error im receiving on ubuntu's pastebin and see if you may know what is causing this?
2010-05-09T11:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	Yes. Go ahead showing me the pastebin.
2010-05-09T11:27:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Thank you. http://paste.ubuntu.com/430398/
2010-05-09T11:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	First do '~$ apt-get autoremove'. Second, what is 'autoscan'? It is no Ubuntu package.
2010-05-09T11:33:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	It's from the BT4 repo's I believe
2010-05-09T11:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	What does 'BT4' stand for?
2010-05-09T11:34:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	BackTrack4, I get the same error on apt-get autoremove
2010-05-09T11:35:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	What tool do you use to install and deinstall Ubuntu packages?
2010-05-09T11:35:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	It's a sec distro. I used the synaptic package manager with their repo. and I usually use sudo apt-get install, or the synaptic manager if I don't know the package name
2010-05-09T11:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	I am using the Synaptic package manager too. --  I am sorry but I cannot help you with Backtrack 4 and any problems it might produce.
2010-05-09T11:38:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Understandable. Think it will be an issue if I upgrade? or cause an issue rather?
2010-05-09T11:39:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	Having read your http://paste.ubuntu.com/430398/, I am afraid, yes.
2010-05-09T11:41:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	That kinda sucks, oh well, guess ill just have to wait to the end of my semester when i can turn my laptop into a full linux machine
2010-05-09T11:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	In the mean time you might consider to get rid of Backtrack 4. --  Good luck.
2010-05-09T11:42:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Indeed...
2010-05-09T11:42:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Thanks for your time and considerations
2010-05-09T11:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	IngeniousHax	Enjoy ubuntu!
2010-05-09T11:44:00.000Z	IngeniousHax	bullgard4	Always do. It's a great OS
