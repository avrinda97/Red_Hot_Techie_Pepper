2007-08-02T10:29:00.000Z	crazy_		any realplayer for feisty fawn PPC?
2007-08-02T10:31:00.000Z	crazy_		I cannot find realplayer for ubuntu PPC
2007-08-02T10:32:00.000Z	crazy_		is there a reaplayer for ubuntu 7.04 on PPC
2007-08-02T10:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	yes but it's hard to find...
2007-08-02T10:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	it's hidden away on the helix site I think
2007-08-02T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	https://player.helixcommunity.org/2004/downloads/  <-- use the installer for ppc
2007-08-02T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	I just gave you a link - choose the real player for ppc on that page
2007-08-02T10:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	make it executable - chmod +x blahblah.bin , then run it with for example ./blah.bin
2007-08-02T10:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	it should ask you some questions - might be better to use  sudo ./blah.bin
2007-08-02T10:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	it's a while since I installed it on my iBook - but it works quite well
2007-08-02T10:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	by the way, most rtsp and real files will playe on ppc ubuntu with gxine and ffmpeg IIRC
2007-08-02T10:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	umm - you used the commands I suggested?
2007-08-02T10:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	nonsense - I have it installed here
2007-08-02T10:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	read the urls from ubotu, please
2007-08-02T11:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	in the universe repository
2007-08-02T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	 enable them in System - Administration - software sources
2007-08-02T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	and IIRC means "if I remember correctly" :)
2007-08-02T11:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	*sigh* then your sources are not complete
2007-08-02T11:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	as I told you before - go to System - Administration - Software Sources  and enable all the sources on the Ubuntu tab
2007-08-02T11:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	and you updated/reloaded, right ?
2007-08-02T11:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	then I can't really help much - obviously somehow you have made a mistake, but it's hard to know what
2007-08-02T11:29:00.000Z	crazy_	thoreauputic	I use apt-get to install ffmpeg. but cannot find on the application/sound and video manual
2007-08-03T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	crazy_	I just did it, scroll up
2007-08-03T08:24:00.000Z	crazy_	thoreauputic	I just log in, did not see your enlightenment
