2006-06-12T14:18:00.000Z	chrisjw		i uninstalled ubuntu and it screwed GRUB up
2006-06-12T14:18:00.000Z	chrisjw		now i can't access my winxp partition
2006-06-12T14:19:00.000Z	chrisjw		tried that
2006-06-12T14:19:00.000Z	chrisjw		it says i have an admin passowrd
2006-06-12T14:19:00.000Z	chrisjw		but i don't
2006-06-12T14:19:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	you surely do. The password should have been set during install.
2006-06-12T14:22:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	this one works very well for resetting xp passwords, http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/bootdisk.html
2006-06-12T14:35:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	did you change some drive settings (or removed any drives) before you got that grub error?
2006-06-12T14:37:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	please no pms. Take it in the channel.
2006-06-12T14:38:00.000Z	chrisjw	zenit	- can i not just modify grub some how?
2006-06-12T14:38:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	Yes, you could boot from a livecd and fix it there.
2006-06-12T14:41:00.000Z	chrisjw	zenit	what live cd can i use?
2006-06-12T14:42:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	you could use the one for dapper? Anyway, if you really want grub back you could follow some of the instructions here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24113
2006-06-12T14:43:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	But I see no point in having grub since you got rid of the nice ubuntu install :/
2006-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	I guess you could just boot from the live-cd and do a `grub-install /dev/hda`
2006-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	or whatever your first drive is
2006-06-12T14:46:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	yes
2006-06-12T14:47:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	yes, that should work ok.
2006-06-12T14:47:00.000Z	chrisjw	zenit	is there not a quicker way to do this though?
2006-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	zenit	chrisjw	It also takes ages just talking about it here :)
2006-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	chrisjw	zenit	found a solution though, thanks for that
