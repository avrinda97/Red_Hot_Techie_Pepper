2006-09-10T11:29:00.000Z	Ricardo		i guess i will just reinstall windows... this is way too much hassle
2006-09-10T11:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	enjoy reading the eula that says they can visit your machine any time any how and remove files from it ;-)
2006-09-10T11:31:00.000Z	Ricardo	ompaul	it beats having a window manager that dosent work and a non-functioning wlan card
2006-09-10T11:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	a window manager that does not work - well it does for everyone else, maybe you are confusing it with it not being the same as the windows environment, because it is different
2006-09-10T11:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	bad language will get you kicked out of here
2006-09-10T11:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	I ran make buildworld more times that I can count
2006-09-10T11:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	that is not how a ubuntu or debian based system works - ohh no - ooch I can see how that would sting
2006-09-10T11:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	read the url the bot sent you
2006-09-10T11:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	reinstall it, you could debug it but you really don't want to do that :-) honestly
2006-09-10T11:35:00.000Z	Ricardo	ompaul	this was a fresh install, all i installed before these updates was automatix
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	stay away from that piece of software, it brings with it a lot of "works for me"
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	two bad steps
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	libs that belong to the next edition and autowhatsit
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	do this, reinstall come back and look for me
2006-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	well reinstall talk to you in 25
2006-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	and don't second guess it :)
2006-09-10T11:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	it is a total mind bend from FreeBSD but it rocks - ipfw ain't in ubuntu but other than that I am rather happy
2006-09-10T11:39:00.000Z	Ricardo	ompaul	i guess it will just take some time to learn the ins and outs
2006-09-10T11:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	well less than some more than others :)
2006-09-10T12:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	u still there?
2006-09-10T12:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	search for "broadcom cafuego 43xx" - I have to do some designated driving back asap
2006-09-10T12:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	leave the wm a while I'll talk to you when I get back
2006-09-10T13:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Ricardo	back
