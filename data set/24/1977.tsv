2009-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	I can't get online until my wireless is working, hence ndiswrapper from CD. :-(
2009-07-14T02:15:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	synaptic > softwaresources, for additional (like cd), also :
2009-07-14T02:23:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	: yes
2009-07-14T02:24:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	It opened the graphical password prompt, then when I entered my password it crashed.
2009-07-14T02:24:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	Is that likely a permissions problem?
2009-07-14T02:25:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	: just can use synaptic, get auto-prompted
2009-07-14T02:25:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	Sorry, I don't understand that.
2009-07-14T02:26:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	: just enter synaptic in trml
2009-07-14T02:27:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	It put up a message that I'm starting it without administrative privileges, and it started fine.
2009-07-14T02:27:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	what's with that?
2009-07-14T02:29:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	no pw-prompt ? close synaptic, sudo synaptic
2009-07-14T02:30:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	Gtk warning: cannot open display.
2009-07-14T02:30:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	if you just start synaptic via menu ?
2009-07-14T02:31:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	it takes my password then crashes no matter how I start it. (unless I run without admin priveleges, apparently.)
2009-07-14T02:33:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	and that machine still has no network ? not wired, also ?
2009-07-14T02:33:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	right
2009-07-14T03:03:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	Okay, I rebooted and synaptic works. Now I want to install ndiswrapper from the cdrom. sorry to bother you guys, but I can't find the specific information I need elsewhere. how do I add the Desktop CD to my sources?
2009-12-12T08:30:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	yes and yes
2009-12-12T08:30:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	Do I have to do anything special when I partition to be able to import a /home partition later?
2009-12-12T08:31:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	no, just set fstab to the correct fs
2009-12-12T08:36:00.000Z	twig11	DasEi2	not to be tiresome, but I want to make sure I've communicated: I can install ubuntu, then later clone the whole ext3 /home partition onto this same hdd? I don't have to set up a partition exactly that size to begin with?
2009-12-12T08:37:00.000Z	DasEi2	twig11	you can as you wish : either you leave that space /home needs blank and clone it after install or set up a fittitng ext4 in seperate and copy your files afterwards
