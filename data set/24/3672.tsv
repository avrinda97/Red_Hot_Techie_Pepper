2007-12-31T01:17:00.000Z	T1m0thy		I am running the LiveCD and need to know the command and options to run a fsck on /dev/sda1 and fix errors.
2007-12-31T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 if its not mounted ' sudo fsck /dev/sda1'
2008-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	  use unzip whatever.zip
2008-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	I said I did..
2008-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 you said you used 7z
2008-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	I said I used both.
2008-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	Please read it again.
2008-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 you could do a 'file whatever.zip' it may be the file is bad.
2008-01-11T02:38:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	Okay, I'll try...
2008-01-11T02:39:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	KALYWAY_LEO_10.5.1intel_SSE2_SSE3.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract --- And I've already downloaded this once before, it did the same thing. It works perfectly fine for other people.
2008-01-11T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	  Interesting.
2008-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	  its still possible its a messed up download.  I doubt if the site posts a md5sum however. Got a URL to the zip?
2008-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	I have an md5sum.
2008-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 md5sum whatever.zip  and see if they check out?
2008-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	okay.
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	should this be taking this long to get the md5sum?
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 depends on the size of the zi[
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 depends on the size of the zip
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	about 3.5 gb.
2008-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 that may take a bit.
2008-01-11T02:49:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	how long did you mean by a bit? :S
2008-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 it depends on your cpu.. the md5sum is a bit of a BIG task. on a 4gb file.. its accessing 4gb of data and  doing calculatons on it.
2008-01-11T02:55:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Dr_willis	I'm reading that I might have to use winRAR to extract this.. does this mean it is impossible on Linux?
2008-04-05T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	T1m0thy	 synaptic :)
