2005-02-26T10:55:00.000Z	bob2		it won't touch any "central libraries"
2005-02-26T10:57:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	it killed libapt-pkg-libc6....
2005-02-26T10:58:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	"no such file or directory"
2005-02-26T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	you do need to actually check what apt wants to do before saying "yes"/.
2005-02-26T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	"didn't think it was a package"?
2005-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	no
2005-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	which wiki page should i be looking at then?
2005-07-14T15:01:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	"fix"?
2005-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	by "not work", you mean "some people don't umount things before trying to eject them"?
2005-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	and supermount is a terrible hack
2005-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	have they filed bugs about that?
2005-07-14T15:04:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	well, different people have had different problems. the simplest problems have been solved by a simple manual umount. others not so much
2005-07-14T15:04:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	if they want it fixed, they have to file bugs
2005-07-14T15:04:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	looking at people's replies to people asking for help on ubuntuforums, it sounds like devs are aware of the problem. just wondering what is being done about it...
2005-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	bah, posting on forums != filing a bug
2005-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	i'll search ubuntu's bug thing now
2005-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	afaik no developers spend time looking for complaints on the forums
2005-07-14T15:06:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	there seems to be a fair few bugs listed on bugzilla related to ejecting cds...
2005-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	cool
2005-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	ok, i've found a few of the bugs i'm interested in... how do i find out what's being done about them? are the bugs discussed on bugzilla?
2005-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	yes, or on the ubuntu-devel mailing list
2005-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	bob2	jacquesmerde	there may have been discussion at the last conference, whichwould be recorded on http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com
2005-07-14T15:09:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	thanks.
2005-07-14T15:10:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	bob2	nothing at udu :(. i'm waiting for this to get fixed so i can come back to ubuntu from arch
