2008-02-29T01:16:00.000Z	keito		I need to burn a .bin/cue file to dvd-r.  I have gnomebaker but this seems to be of no use.  I believe cdrecord is the way to go but the command I'm using cdrecord -dao cuefile=test.cue doesn't work any ideas?
2008-02-29T01:16:00.000Z	keito		dao seems to be where its going wrong
2008-02-29T01:17:00.000Z	keito		error: cdrecord: No tracks specified. Need at least one.
2008-02-29T01:17:00.000Z	amenado	keito	it has to be stored as .bin/.cue? can you not make an .iso of a whole dir and burn the .iso once you make it?
2008-02-29T01:17:00.000Z	keito	amenado	i got the file as a bin.
2008-02-29T01:18:00.000Z	keito	amenado	i think you can convert the bin to iso though perhaps?
2008-02-29T01:18:00.000Z	amenado	keito	so?
2008-02-29T01:18:00.000Z	amenado	keito	it has to be stored as .bin/.cue? can you not make an .iso of a whole dir and burn the .iso once you make it?
2008-02-29T01:18:00.000Z	keito	amenado	I just wanna get this image onto a disc asap ;)
2008-02-29T01:19:00.000Z	keito	amenado	I have no dir to make an iso.  I already have the bin file nothing more
2008-02-29T01:19:00.000Z	keito	amenado	making an iso of the folder that contains the bin file wouldn';t work i'm guessing?
2008-02-29T01:20:00.000Z	amenado	keito	you can create a dir? and put all your files there then make an iso of off the dir
2008-02-29T01:20:00.000Z	amenado	keito	i am telling you it works, you can make an iso of a folder
2008-02-29T01:22:00.000Z	keito	amenado	unless I'm missing something.... I have on my computer a folder containing a file called test.bin and test.cue.... are you saying i can create an iso of that folder and burn it and it will create a dvd-r playable in a dvd player?
2008-02-29T01:22:00.000Z	keito	amenado	i don't have the original files that were used to create the bin image. so I can't just *create* an iso of those original files...
2008-02-29T01:23:00.000Z	amenado	keito	i did not say the dvd-r will be playable, all i said was you can create an iso off of  a directory, besides you were not clear of your goal so i gave you advise on assumptions
2008-02-29T01:23:00.000Z	keito	amenado	I think you need to go back and read the original post --> I need to burn a .bin/cue file to dvd-r.  I have gnomebaker but this seems to be of no use.  I believe cdrecord is the way to go but the command I'm using cdrecord -dao cuefile=test.cue doesn't work any ideas? PRETTY CLEAR?!!
2008-02-29T01:24:00.000Z	amenado	keito	btw what is in this .bin and .cue  a windows game?
2008-02-29T01:24:00.000Z	keito	amenado	no. it is not a windows game.  it's a video file (.avi)
2008-02-29T01:24:00.000Z	keito	amenado	cheers anyways ;)
2008-02-29T01:24:00.000Z	amenado	keito	did you mention anything there that your iso has to play in a dvd-r ? you just said you want to burn..
2008-02-29T01:25:00.000Z	keito	amenado	I have NO ISO!!!
2008-02-29T01:25:00.000Z	amenado	keito	well good luck
2008-02-29T01:25:00.000Z	keito	amenado	cheers
