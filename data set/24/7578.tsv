2004-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	elm1		anywhere
2004-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	elm1		really strange
2004-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	Deft_u	elm1	try lsmod | grep snd
2004-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	elm1		 when i want to increase volume on the sound applet 
2004-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	elm1		it jumps back to 0
2004-09-29T12:58:00.000Z	elm1		sorry have to boot my other machine first
2004-09-29T12:59:00.000Z	elm1		also acpi doesn't seem to work
2004-09-29T13:01:00.000Z	elm1	Deft_u	- i did lsmod ...
2004-09-29T13:02:00.000Z	Deft_u	elm1	did you see any snd drivers loaded?
2004-09-29T13:02:00.000Z	elm1		yep
2004-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	Deft_u	elm1	which drivers are loadedfor your card?
2004-09-29T13:05:00.000Z	elm1		snd_ac97_codec
2004-09-29T13:05:00.000Z	elm1		hang on - i think they are probably not loaded
2004-09-29T13:06:00.000Z	elm1		could it be that snd_intel8x0m and snd_intel8x0 are the drivers
2004-09-29T13:07:00.000Z	elm1		because they don't seem to be loaded
2004-09-29T13:08:00.000Z	Deft_u	elm1	very likely
