2012-02-22T22:31:00.000Z	haylo		there is a menu editor thing for ubuntu vindav
2012-02-22T22:31:00.000Z	haylo		oh actually sorry so many things have changed vindav
2012-02-22T22:32:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 we'll, one of my Ubuntu 11.1 desktops have it both displayed, and on another, it doesn't.
2012-02-22T22:32:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	use 11.04 and switch to the classic (gnome) fallback mode. its way easier to use
2012-02-22T22:33:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 would that be done when I log in asking me what to choose ?
2012-02-22T22:33:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	no thats an installer- no options like that presented
2012-02-22T22:34:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 we'll...how does one switch to classic gnome fallback mode ?
2012-02-22T22:36:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	linux login screens always have options to switch users and window managers. so logout >switch it up and > log back in
2012-02-22T22:37:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	if you install something like xfce this is how you would find it
2012-02-22T23:52:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 I was able to get the gnome look by disabling Unity from when loggin in.  At this time I still don't have 'Preferences' and 'Administration' menus.  Any thoughts ?
2012-02-22T23:53:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	hold i am back in ubuntu
2012-02-22T23:55:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	system > preferences > Main menu     it is a pain to find bt you will see there are more options for your menu than you previously thought
2012-02-23T00:00:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	I am not able to even get to see the menu:  system.  I only see system tools, and even in that sub-menu what you suggest I do not find.
2012-02-23T00:22:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 any thoughts about why I do not see Preferences and Administration in the Main Menu but everything else in Ubuntu 11.1 ?
2012-02-23T00:22:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	system > preferences > Main menu     it is a pain to find bt you will see there are more options for your menu than you previously thought
2012-02-23T00:22:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 yes, I saw that suggestion before, but it;s not showing up.
2012-02-23T00:25:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 at the top right hand of my screen, there is 'System Settings'.
2012-02-23T00:26:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 what is the terminal command to do   classic fallback mode   ?
2012-02-23T00:26:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	i dont think you can change mid session like that
2012-02-23T00:29:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 I'll try that out and let you know.
2012-02-23T00:29:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	install your self a useful window manager like xfce4
2012-02-23T01:56:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 after about 10 restarts, doing a unity reset, removing compizconfig, and lightdm including to make sure to reboot and select Gnome classic, nothing produces the preferences and administration menu.  Any thoughts ?
2012-02-23T02:10:00.000Z	vindav	haylo	 looks like I have to reinstall Ubuntu 11.1; thank for your help and insight today.
2012-02-23T02:11:00.000Z	haylo	vindav	reinstall 11.10?
