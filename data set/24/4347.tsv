2007-05-05T14:31:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	did you find the powerpc info you were looking for?
2007-05-05T14:38:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	what do yo need to know
2007-05-05T14:39:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	if osx will allow a second partition
2007-05-05T14:40:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	yes osx is fine with lots of partitions
2007-05-05T14:40:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	my powerbook is setup as a dual boot
2007-05-05T14:41:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	did you Install OS X at the same time or after Ubuntu?
2007-05-05T14:42:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	the best method is to reinstall mac os x, and use the mac os x disktool to do the partitoning
2007-05-05T14:42:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	if you leave some of the disk as unallocated, then the ubuntu installer can pick that bit up
2007-05-05T14:42:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	well that's my problem... my life is on this Hdd... I don't want to loose ANYTHING
2007-05-05T14:43:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	the other option is to resize the existing mac os x partiton
2007-05-05T14:43:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	but there is a risk of that going wrong
2007-05-05T14:43:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	if you don't have a back up then please dont try to install ubuntu :-)
2007-05-05T14:43:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	well, what all could go wrong???
2007-05-05T14:44:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	resizing partitions is a new thing. it doe not always work
2007-05-05T14:46:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	So no matter what I really REALLY need to back everything up... meaning i need another external 60gb..... christ
2007-05-05T14:46:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	get yourself an external hard disk and back up your life
2007-05-05T14:47:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	you are living dangerously day to day if you dont have a backup
2007-05-05T14:47:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	That's $$$ and time, >:o!
2007-05-05T14:47:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	how much is your data worth?
2007-05-05T14:48:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	over a million, and I think OS X can handle itself. I have everything that I absolutely need to live on a 160gb external, but... it's about full.
2007-05-05T14:49:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	so you have a lot of data
2007-05-05T14:50:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	Yeah... It's where I back up my cache of OS's/application
2007-05-05T14:52:00.000Z	ssam	Bradford	you can get 300GB firewire disks in the UK for about 100, and everything is meant to be cheaper in the states
2007-05-05T14:53:00.000Z	Bradford	ssam	Well I haven't looked too much into it... If I had $100 I'd save it for a Mac Pro
