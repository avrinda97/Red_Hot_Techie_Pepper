2011-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	mrdeb		on the box
2011-03-25T07:36:00.000Z	mrdeb		-h = hurt
2011-03-25T07:37:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	In this context, it stands for halt
2011-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	For the sake of this channel, there is none
2011-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	what are the gallium drivers? open ati drivers?
2011-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Yes
2011-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	what is the performance hit in percentage when using hte gallium driver vs ati's
2011-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Actually, gallium is new code in mesa. The classic mesa driver is currently default
2011-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	You dont compare fglrx because it doesnt support older cards
2011-03-25T07:45:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Its classic mesa vs gallium. Means opengl 1.5 vs opengl 2.1
2011-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	fglrx is faster but doesnt support kms which allows the open drivers to have advanced features
2011-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	do your own tests. r600g is being heavily developed
2011-03-25T07:46:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	or ask in #radeon
2011-03-25T07:47:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	#radeon
2011-03-25T07:48:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	The thing is, open drivers are getting faster all the time, while fglrx is just basically a bunch of the code they use on windoze
2011-03-25T07:48:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	i want something that doesnt suck. the nvidia nouveau driver sucks compared to nvidia's. it's 10 percent
2011-03-25T07:50:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Yea, but the thing is, AMD bought ATI, dropped the ATI name in favor of Radeon opened even more hardware specifications and hired kernel developers to work full time on the open driver. Nvidia on the other hand does not release any hardware specs so nouveau must be painstakingly reverse engineered
2011-03-25T07:51:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Obviously its much easier to program a decent driver with hardware specs than trying to fish around in the dark
2011-03-25T07:52:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	i need to know how much the peformance is
2011-03-25T07:52:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	#radeon
2011-03-25T07:53:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	Test yourself or google or something. r600g is heavily being worked on and you have to be patient in #radeon
2011-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	soreau	mrdeb	I havent tried it so I cant say. But I do know its an entirely REd driver, and 3D is entirely unsupported
2011-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	do you like nouveau
2011-04-08T07:01:00.000Z	mrdeb	soreau	hahaha
