2011-11-03T14:25:00.000Z	scotty^		!pastebin
2011-11-03T14:31:00.000Z	scotty^	jeus	U still there?
2011-11-03T14:32:00.000Z	scotty^	jeus	Click on the little cog symbol in the top right corner and then click Displays
2011-11-03T14:37:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan: hold on a moment
2011-11-03T14:40:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan: which is supposed to be connected?  DFP1 (your LCD flatscreen) or CRT1 (your big cathode ray tube monitor)?
2011-11-03T14:41:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan:  So you want to connect two LCD's, but it only recognises one?
2011-11-03T14:42:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan:  Are you sure the ATI card is being used and not your Sandy Bridge graphics?
2011-11-03T14:44:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan: It sounds like you might be one of the lucky people who can switch between the integratged Sandy Bridge graphics and the discrete ATI graphics in your BIOS.  AFAIK, using both at the same time is not supported.
2011-11-03T14:48:00.000Z	scotty^		milligan:  U have an ATI Radeon HD5450, correct?
2011-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	scotty^	jeus	R u still there?
