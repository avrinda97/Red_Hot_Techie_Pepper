2011-11-28T23:32:00.000Z	lduros		Hello, anybody knows if Ubuntu works well with all the components of the new dell XPS 14z laptop: http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-l412z/pd?~ck=mn -- it has an NVIDIA GeForce GT 520M with Optimus -- is this something that would work with nvidia drivers in ubuntu?
2011-11-28T23:32:00.000Z	lduros		considering buying it, that's why i'm asking :-)
2011-11-28T23:32:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	there are some projects to do optimus out there, search for them. You're in need of a lot of reading. I do think you're in luck though because the projects have been around for a couple months
2011-11-28T23:34:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	its two graphics chips on the same machine, in windows they dynamically switch between the two chips. in linux you have to manually do it
2011-11-28T23:34:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	ok, i see
2011-11-28T23:35:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	yeah so you would run your main environment on the intel card, because intel works really nice for unity and gnome-shell. then you could use the cli to launch certain apps and tell them to use your nvidia card
2011-11-28T23:35:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	from what I gather
2011-11-28T23:35:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	hmm ok
2011-11-28T23:35:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	so really the nvidia card wouldn't be used that much
2011-11-28T23:37:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	yeah it wouldnt be, some bios let you force intel OR nvidia
2011-11-28T23:37:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	you could choose
2011-11-28T23:38:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	I see
2011-11-28T23:38:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	I plan to buy one someone soon. I'll probably just use intel all the time, its less power hungry and it has very good driver support
2011-11-28T23:38:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	you were planning on buying the xps 14z?
2011-11-28T23:39:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	I prefer Fedora for my desktop/laptop because I like gnome-shell. however I still use ubuntu on my servers
2011-11-28T23:39:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	ok, couldn't you use gnome-shell in ubuntu or debian though?
2011-11-28T23:39:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	im not sure, I kind of want one of the newer ultrabooks... i just figure they will all come with Intel/Nvidia optimus crap
2011-11-28T23:40:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	i think so, however ubuntu keeps changing so many things each release without documenting why... mainly the things that are not integrating with upstream.. that I just choose fedora
2011-11-28T23:40:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	yeh, the newer ultrabooks are too thin for me though, they'd fly away on my lap in my backyard :-P
2011-11-28T23:40:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	i'm probably speaking blasphemy here
2011-11-28T23:40:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	what's the advantage of fedora? :-P I'd miss the "Debian" way of organizing things a bit, especially after taking great pains learning it
2011-11-28T23:41:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	I would just check it out, fedora is a very nice system if you know linux. It's not as ready for non-linux people as ubuntu is. but it is quite nice
2011-11-28T23:41:00.000Z	lduros	storrgie	ok, thanks :-)
2011-11-28T23:41:00.000Z	storrgie	lduros	if you want, msg me in private and I will give you my email. I can help you settle into fedora from that
