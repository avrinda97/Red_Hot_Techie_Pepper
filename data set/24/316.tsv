2011-12-02T16:03:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	sorry, I'm not paying attention to what you are saying, you just keep hilighting me
2011-12-02T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	what ?
2011-12-02T20:59:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	repeating the question, won't change the teqnique you where given before
2011-12-02T20:59:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	you need to state the problems you had with the ICS technique you where given before
2011-12-02T21:00:00.000Z	unannounced	ikonia	i already read and followed what was on the link but have failed
2011-12-02T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	however, the way to do it will be the same as before, so you need to fix what went wrong, rather than ask for a different way to do it
2011-12-02T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	no one is being mean to you,
2011-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	to save you rules ?

2011-12-03T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	you can't compile it
2011-12-03T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	you also shouldn't use "./configure" unless you really understand what you are doing
2011-12-03T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	seriously, unless you understand what you are doing, blindly using options such as ./configure is a bad idea
2011-12-03T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	unannounced	the basics of being able to check if a file is there that sort of thing suggests you may not be in the best position to start trying to build software
