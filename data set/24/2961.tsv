2008-06-10T14:45:00.000Z	The-Seiman		no one can help me to rebuild the kernel ? :-/
2008-06-10T14:45:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	which kernel?
2008-06-10T14:46:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	the Linux kernel ( 2.6.24-18-generic )
2008-06-10T14:46:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	why would you wanna be doing that?
2008-06-10T14:47:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	thats a very valid reason, but .18 is a little old isnt it?
2008-06-10T14:48:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	no need for synaptic or apt if your gunna go compiling your own, get the fresh stuff from kernel.org
2008-06-10T14:49:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	oh no not the "Debian" way, thats no good
2008-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	should have done zcat /proc/config.gz >> /usr/linux/.config
2008-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	or "cp /boot/config-`uname -r` /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`/debian/config/386" ?
2008-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	i trust whats running more than that ;)
2008-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	probably it's a noob question, but why /proc/config.gz and not the config file located at /boot/ ?
2008-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	the /proc version is garunteed 100% the config for the kernel your running, the /boot may not be
2008-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	okay thanks :-)
2008-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	its just the same thing and one has more success, so i think why not do that
2008-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	all the ndiswrapper and other proprietary stuff will be included ?
2008-06-10T14:54:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	it will copy over your kernel config your running now, but 3rd party stuff on top such as nvidia drivers, madwifi etc will have to be compiled again, against the new kernel sources, so they function
2008-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	okay thank you :-)
2008-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	no problem
2008-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	well i don't find the /proc/config.gz but i'ill use /boot/config-`uname -r` anyway .
2008-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	thats gay, use the /boot :)
2008-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	hmm... one more question, ndiswrapper and acer_acpi are installed using .deb packages
2008-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	so do I need to reinstall them in the new kernel ?
2008-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	jeed	The-Seiman	you should be ok with stuff like ndiswrapper
2008-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	The-Seiman	jeed	okay thanks :-)
