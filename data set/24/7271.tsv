2005-03-01T07:06:00.000Z	tritium		It'll require modifying your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2005-03-01T07:07:00.000Z	Slask3n	tritium	ok, but ill look into the readme first
2005-03-01T07:08:00.000Z	tritium	Slask3n	yes, it'll explain all that.
2005-03-01T07:13:00.000Z	Slask3n	tritium	sorry, but i didt really understand that :s i read the appendix J...
2005-03-01T07:13:00.000Z	tritium	Slask3n	read the TwinView section as well
2005-03-01T07:14:00.000Z	Slask3n		ok :)
2005-03-01T07:21:00.000Z	Slask3n	tritium	im really sorry, im pretty n00b and i cant see how it makes sense... can you please explain a bit more?
2005-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	tritium	Slask3n	I have work to do at the momemt, so I can't really explain it any better than the documentation.  I can send you my config as an example, though.
2005-03-01T07:27:00.000Z	Slask3n		sure, thanks :)
2005-03-01T07:28:00.000Z	Slask3n	tritium	that would be nice, i understand you need to work... but maybe i understand it better tomorrow... its 02:28 AM now so i soon go to bed, and maybe it makes sense tomorrow :)

2005-03-01T07:30:00.000Z	tritium	Slask3n	just keep in mind that it's a config file for X.org, not XFree86, but the TwinView stuff is identical
