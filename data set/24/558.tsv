2011-06-04T04:24:00.000Z	Kroplex2		When compressing a file on Ubuntu 11.04, how do you seperate it into 500mb file sizes?
2011-06-04T04:25:00.000Z	Kroplex2		Anybody?
2011-06-04T04:25:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	split
2011-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	what does that mean? the option to split the files is disabled on every single selection available (tar.bz2, etc.)
2011-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	Type into your command line "man split"
2011-06-04T04:27:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	so I compress it into one tar.bz2 or whatever and then I use the split command?
2011-06-04T04:27:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	Guess you can also pipe it directly to split
2011-06-04T04:28:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	how would I do that? I'm really new to ubuntu this is my first install.
2011-06-04T04:28:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	Okay, maybe you describe a little more detailed what you're trying to do.
2011-06-04T04:29:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	I want to compress the directory ("/mnt/Users/Administrator") into 500mb section files.
2011-06-04T04:29:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	so instead of one huge 22.6GB file, several 500MB size files.
2011-06-04T04:30:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	Do you have twice as much space as the compressed file size?
2011-06-04T04:30:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	I'm sorry? It is not compressed yet. But I have plenty of free space.
2011-06-04T04:32:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	Maybe http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/tar-split-question-605013/ is for you. I would just create a compressed file with the compression you like. Then you can split with "split" from the command line.
2011-06-04T04:34:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	You should probably read the man pages of tar and split to get a clearer picture.
2011-06-04T04:35:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	reading the "man split" helped, I think I found what I need
2011-06-04T04:35:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	one following question though how do you reverse the command to put the files back together
2011-06-04T04:36:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	If you're new to linux you should get use to the "man" command
2011-06-04T04:36:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	cat
2011-06-04T04:37:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	so like cat file2.tar file3.tar??
2011-06-04T04:37:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	As I said: "man cat"
2011-06-04T04:39:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	you can concatenate multiple files at once
2011-06-04T04:40:00.000Z	Kroplex2	ysis	and w30, thank you so much. I'll go do this now and leave you alone :)
2011-06-04T04:41:00.000Z	ysis	Kroplex2	you're welcome
