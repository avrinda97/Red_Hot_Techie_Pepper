2008-04-29T07:07:00.000Z	dmsuperman		Whenever I reboot my computer loses track of the time. This isn't limited to Ubuntu, however I'm figuring you guys might know. It isn't the mobo, though. It still happens even with a new motherboard and processor. Rebooting causes Ubuntu to go 4 hours back, and windows to go 4 hours ahead
2008-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	ahh, this has to do with the system clock being set to UTC time, or not being set to UTC time
2008-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	It started up suddenly though, on a previous motherboard. I have a new mobo now, and it still does it. Is this in the BIOS though? Should I set it to UTC or not to?
2008-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	I can't remember what Windows does, the standard in Linux is to have the system time set to UTC and it adjusts accordingly.
2008-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	I'm guessing windows doesn't do that, that is why it there is a 4 hour difference between the two OS
2008-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	That would make sense, only they're both 4 hours off
2008-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	For example, right now it's 10PM. Ubuntu says 6PM, and if I were to boot into windows it would say 2AM tomorrow
2008-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	hmm, that is odd, 4 hours both in oposite directions?
2008-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	Plus, even keeping it sync'ed with the internet (both in windows and ubuntu) gives me the same time (4 hours off both ways)
2008-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	hmm, that is odd, perhaps check in the BIOS
2008-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	do you have your timezones set correctly?  Perhaps in windows it is the -4 and Ubuntu is +4?
2008-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	I shall, I was just hoping somebody here would know. It doesn't seem like a BIOS issue, since a new mobo didn't fix it (and no, I didn't buy a new mobo just to fix it :P)
2008-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	Nope, both are set to New York
2008-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	hmm, I'm not sure, more complex than I suspected. :) sorry
2008-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	no problems
2008-04-29T08:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	I rebooted, and my BIOS now has the correct time
2008-04-29T08:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	however Ubuntu is still 4 hours off. What should I be setting it to?
2008-04-29T08:09:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	hmm, I just remember that in the install or many installs it always asks if my clock is set to UTC time, and I check yes., let me see if there is somewhere to set that after install
2008-04-29T08:09:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	awesome, thanks
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	I just told it to sync with internet, and it fixed it. We'll see upon reboot though
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	I don't remember hardy asking me that though, odd.
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shane2peru	hopefully it works though. thanks for the suggestion :D
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	ok
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	shane2peru	dmsuperman	no prob
