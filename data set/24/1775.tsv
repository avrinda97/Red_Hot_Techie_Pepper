2010-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	you won't find active programmers here usually
2010-09-12T23:40:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	i see it  :D
2010-09-12T23:42:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	if you put your question to the channel someone might be able to help in solving your problem
2010-09-12T23:42:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	well i dont think so, its a please not a question. a please to fix one bug with priority ;)
2010-09-12T23:44:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	then I suggest visiting the bug report page and trying to give it additional weight (or you could find the appropriate mailing list ...)
2010-09-12T23:44:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	i try to come into the evolution IRC channel
2010-09-12T23:44:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	i can program so maybe i can fix it, i just need to talk to developers
2010-09-12T23:45:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	great :-) - usually the project website should provide the necessary info to contact them
2010-09-12T23:46:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	yep, i am in the channel now :)
2010-09-12T23:46:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	ok and thx for the initiative
2010-09-12T23:46:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	np
2010-09-13T00:04:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	there is nobody on in the channel (all idling). It's frustrating, i have the problem but i do not know, which program works against the specification so that i can't fix it...
2010-09-13T00:05:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	I suggested the project website or the bug reports site for that project - irc channels are something for *very* patient people sometimes
2010-09-13T00:06:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	but this can't be true. this bug prevents you from importing contacts into the Ubuntu One address book, and nobody wants to fix it (the bug report is open since months), but it's so easy to fix...
2010-09-13T00:07:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	you might find some open ears in #ubuntuone
2010-09-13T00:07:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	k, thx
2010-09-13T00:10:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	there is also noone responding
2010-09-13T00:15:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	i have got the patch and there is no other reason for the bug than lazyness, sillyness or incompetent developers. THAT is really frustrating...
2010-09-13T00:16:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	why don't you submit the patch?
2010-09-13T00:17:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	well, it's an upstream problem and i have problems with bugzilla, i hate bugzilla. if i sent the patch to launchpad, the problem is upstream still there. maybe i should send it via mail to someone...
2010-09-13T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	sorry, I cannot help you there -- mind you: I guess no devloper will submit a patch written by someone else
2010-09-13T00:19:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	yeah, that might be a problem...
2010-09-13T00:22:00.000Z	levu	guntbert	thx
2010-09-13T00:23:00.000Z	guntbert	levu	np, I was convinced you knew that :-)
