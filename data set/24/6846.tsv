2008-03-16T01:06:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	I lost power and internet for a while there, if fglrxinfo is saying you have the ati drivers in use, installing xserver-xgl will enable desktop effects
2008-03-16T01:08:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	see the problem is that I can get the driver installed...but I get an "out of range" message on the monitor on reboot after the installation...weird thing is, my friend installed it before and had it working, but now when I do it, I get that message on the monitor
2008-03-16T01:08:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	I made a change to xorg.conf under the screen section trying to lock to a resolution...I'm thinking maybe refresh rate is killing me, but i'm rather confused about itall
2008-03-16T01:10:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	^^ and, possibly the fglrx driver is having issues talking to your monitor. Rare, but it happens. Again, Xorg.0.log will indicate that

2008-03-16T01:10:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	that's my log
2008-03-16T01:12:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	that's for the ati driver. That looks ok
2008-03-16T01:13:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	also, line 1102 is where the ati/radeon driver gets the monitor specs, make sure you have the equiv when you try the fglrx driver
2008-03-16T01:17:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	it's doable, done it with many other systems
2008-03-16T01:18:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	IT WORKED!!!!
2008-03-16T01:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	I added the refresh rates as per the log and the 'screen' section as per int_main and now I've got it enabled and video :D
2008-03-16T01:19:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	thats a good thing, right ;)
2008-03-16T01:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	you betcha :D
2008-03-16T01:20:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	and run fglrxinfo , make sure it's using ati 8.37.6 drivers
2008-03-16T01:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	yep
2008-03-16T01:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	good on that front
2008-03-16T01:21:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	install xserver-xgl and compizconfig-settings-manager , log out and back in.
2008-03-16T01:21:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	then, system->prefs->appearance  effects tab
2008-03-16T01:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	ahh, it said the composite extention wasn't there
2008-03-16T01:22:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	I'm assuming this enables it
2008-03-16T01:23:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	I'm all awesome now ! :D
2008-03-16T01:23:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	cool
2008-03-16T01:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	nickrud_	one more quick question, are there any ATI settings control panel the way there is the "nvidia-settings" to enable dual monitors ?
2008-03-16T01:36:00.000Z	nickrud_	tristanmike	not that I'm aware of
