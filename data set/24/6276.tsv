2006-11-04T14:08:00.000Z	grahamldlw		can someone tell me how to open a file in the terminal, say a pascal code file, so i can run it on the terminal?
2006-11-04T14:10:00.000Z	grahamldlw		it brought up some nano thing but what does that do and how do i use it?
2006-11-04T14:10:00.000Z	grahamldlw		but isnt there a way to just run it through the terminal
2006-11-04T14:11:00.000Z	grahamldlw		i've seen it done b4 but cant remember how
2006-11-04T14:11:00.000Z	grahamldlw		huh???
2006-11-04T14:12:00.000Z	grahamldlw		so it tells me if it's working or not, compile it
2006-11-04T14:12:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	you seem to be confused.  a file such as you mentioned is a source code file for a programming language.  You can change it with an editor, and of course you can compile it, and then run it.
2006-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	you may be thinking of an IDE, which is a program that wraps an editor, and compiler, and such into an easy to use interface
2006-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	you can use, say, emacs, or vim, both of which allow you to compile from within the editor
2006-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	it's the "it" that is in question here, not whether it can be done from a terminal
2006-11-04T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	as I said, both vim and emacs allow you to edit, compile, and run, from a terminal session
2006-11-04T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	those are the ones that come to mind in this environment
2006-11-04T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	most IDEs are GUI only; vim and emacs are the only ones I can think of, at the moment, that do what you are saying from a terminal
2006-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	you can run the compiler from the command line, sure, and then run the compiled program.
2006-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	is that what you mean?
2006-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	what's compilcated?  I told you, emacs and vim can both do what you are asking.
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	so?  you can't manage to type:    emacs filename?
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	or,   vim filename?
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	no such thing
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	nothing is "built in".  some things are installed by default.
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	indeed, I do.
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	since I know and you don't.
2006-11-04T14:17:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	well, since you obviously know people who are so much smarter than we are, why don't you go talk to one of them?
2006-11-04T14:18:00.000Z	sethk	grahamldlw	well, since we are all so inadequate, I guess you'll have to wait until he's on line.
