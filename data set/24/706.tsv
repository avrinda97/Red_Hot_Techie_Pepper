2011-03-10T14:45:00.000Z	Sonne		why would you do that?
2011-03-10T14:46:00.000Z	Sonne		ahh, so that was the copy/paste of the tab...
2011-03-10T14:48:00.000Z	Sonne		do it on a fresh and clean directory
2011-03-10T14:48:00.000Z	Sonne		this will only download and unpack the debian sources for that software
2011-03-10T14:50:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	oki, thank you
2011-03-10T14:20:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	unfortunately that's as much as you can do - next time try avoiding installing by those means
2011-03-10T14:21:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	any specific reason why you compiled wine from source?
2011-03-10T14:21:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	yes I had to compile to make a old game work
2011-03-10T14:22:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	i shall teach you of apt-get source!
2011-03-10T14:22:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	try apt-get source wine
2011-03-10T14:23:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	Yeah i was about to do that, but i would like to make sure all traces of my old wine was completely gone
2011-03-10T14:23:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	you have to trust the makefile, try making .deb packages every time you can from now on
2011-03-10T14:47:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	what was wine apt get install command again? i just did a tutorial on serious system cleaning :D
2011-03-10T14:48:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	apt-get source wine
2011-03-10T14:48:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	what version will it download? why not just use the ubuntu software center
2011-03-10T14:49:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	because it will download the sources, not the package - and will download the same version as the packages
2011-03-10T14:50:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	i dont want the source this time, i just want a normal installation of wine:-)
2011-03-10T14:50:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	in this case, just go with the software center - OR use the wine PPA
2011-03-10T14:55:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	I installed wine the usual way, then purged wine and deleted all traces in my applications menu, then i compiled wine from source. Now i have removed wine and installed from software center again, but no entrys in my application menu  this time :(
2011-03-10T14:55:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	try purging everything first... apt-get --purge remove wine.*
2011-03-10T15:01:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	ok did your command - next install from software center ?
2011-03-10T15:02:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	aye
2011-03-10T15:02:00.000Z	jnlsnl_	Sonne	would you recommend the (beta release)
2011-03-10T15:05:00.000Z	Sonne	jnlsnl_	beta release?
