2010-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	anandre		Installing Ubuntu on a Windows machine so it can dual-boot seems to be pretty easy.  How hard is it to install Windows on an Ubuntu machine and have it dual-boot?
2010-02-27T07:39:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	if you have enough memory I'd suggest installing ubuntu and running windoze inside virtualbox
2010-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	what kind of memory?  RAM?
2010-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	yes .. e.g. if you want to give windows 1gb and leave another for ubuntu
2010-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	I'm sorry for jumping in and sending you off on a tangent ... I'm not even sure for what you want to use windows, is it for gaming ?
2010-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	yes.  I can repost my initial problem if you want.
2010-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	never mind.  Package manager says it's wine1.2
2010-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	any specific games you are trying to run on windows ?, because fair few can be run with WINE but if you have already eliminated that then I'm not sure running in a VM will help you much for gaming
2010-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	WoW specifically.

2010-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	here's a rather silly question.  I installed Wine before realizing I should get Wine1.2.  How do I check which I'm using (did Wine1.2 overwrite Wine)?
2010-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	I uess that dpeends on how you installed. normaly you should be installing evrything via synaptic and it gets taken care of
2010-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	I did it via sudo apt-get I think.  Willis' command returned wine-1.1.31, which I would assume is not wine1.2?
2010-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	apt-get is what synaptice uses underneath anyway so you would only have one version
2010-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	ok then you should be right to go
2010-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	the Wowwiki link you gave me is more or less a link I posted earlier (which I was following).  WoW still refuses to work for me though. :s
2010-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	ah sorry about that... there was some python script stuff about that automated a lot of this stuff, can't remeber the name of that now
2010-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	http://www.playonlinux.com/en/ but I'm not familiar with
2010-02-27T08:12:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	let me know if you have success with it, I'd be interested for me too
2010-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	I'm looking into the virtualbox right now.  I've yet to find more info on Wine beyond a lot of the same pages seeming to have the same info.
2010-02-27T08:15:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	ok virtualbox will work guaranteed assuming you have your original disks and license to activate... the only thing I'm not 100% certain of is you require power graphics drivers or performance critical
2010-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	anandre	hipitihop	do I absolutely need the original disks or will an ISO work?
2010-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	I use vb in my everyday paid software development which I have no choice but to run on windows, so I know vb works and is stbale, but I also don't try and run grphic intensive games.
2010-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	hipitihop	anandre	I've never tried installing widows off iso but I don't think there is any copy-protection and the like so should work
