2009-05-17T13:32:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	yes.
2009-05-17T13:32:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	and what is the name  of that antivurs and where can i get it
2009-05-17T13:33:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	for doing the web, there's a plugin for squid that you can find via google - i don't recall what it's called, but it utilizes clamav
2009-05-17T13:33:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	and you can use squid with iptables to setup transproxying scanning - so any web traffic over a lan automatically gets scanned no matter what someone's web settings are
2009-05-17T13:33:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	i am looking for an antivirus program that will protect me against viruses when i use my computer when i surf the web when i basically do anything
2009-05-17T13:34:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	but that's only gonna be good if you intend to share the information with windows machines
2009-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	I am looking basically for a border guard and an active military force on my computer that seeks out and destroys the enemy
2009-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	heh, iptables+squid+thatsquidvirusscannerpluginthingy will do the job
2009-05-17T13:37:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	i will look at that
2009-05-17T13:53:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	there are so many options for virus scanning in Ubuntu that you can practically have it scan its own scans - if you're looking for a GUI, it's there (clamgtk or something like that) and if you don't mind editting some config files, squid will actively scan your web traffic - it'll do port 80 and 443
2009-05-17T13:54:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	all i want is to keep mya ccount information safe
2009-05-17T13:54:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	account information

2009-05-17T13:56:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	have you read this yet? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Security
2009-05-17T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	you destroyed whole units?!
2009-05-17T13:59:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	yes
2009-05-17T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	when you install firefox, you should install the noscript plugin as well, that will prevent click-jacking and XSS, among other things
2009-05-17T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	do you work for the government or a terrorist organisation?
2009-05-17T14:01:00.000Z	NewApples	Gnea	haha maybe ;)
2009-05-17T14:02:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	:)
2009-05-17T14:06:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	if you want to properly destroy data, then DBAN is what you want - but your Swedish, so be careful with some of the methods
2009-05-17T14:07:00.000Z	Gnea	NewApples	you might want to ask in #security and #linux as well
