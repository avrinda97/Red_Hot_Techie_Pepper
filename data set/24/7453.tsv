2004-11-23T13:42:00.000Z	ironwolf		how does one turn on SHMConfig in xorg?
2004-11-23T13:43:00.000Z	daniels	ironwolf	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, in the section with 'Driver "synaptics"', add 'Option "SHMConfig"'
2004-11-23T13:48:00.000Z	ironwolf	daniels	should I change the Driver "mouse" to Driver "synaptics" ?
2004-11-23T14:19:00.000Z	ironwolf	daniels	What exactly should I change in Driver "mouse" to make it synaptics and happy?
