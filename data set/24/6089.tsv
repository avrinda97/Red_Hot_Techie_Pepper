2006-01-20T09:13:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	may i suggest a nick change before some other op takes action?
2006-01-20T09:14:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	I see nothing inappropriate about my nick
2006-01-20T09:14:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	my advice is based on behaviour from other ops. take it or don't.
2006-01-20T09:35:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	we don't advise installing any non official packages here
2006-01-20T09:36:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	me either, but I was just answering a question, not giving advice on said act
2006-01-20T09:40:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	yes repos = repositories. and we usually find out what pkg a user wants to install from an rpm, since we have over 17,000 pkgs available. they probably aren't aware of the ubuntu pkg
2006-01-20T11:17:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	don't ask folks to paste in here please
2006-01-20T11:35:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	oh hfs+ ???
2006-01-20T11:37:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	it shrinks hfs just fine, i use it on all my macs
2006-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	we help folks in here all the time. we don't offer info that doesnt work
2006-01-20T11:38:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	explain the gparted.sf site then please
2006-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	BastardLinux	i have no control over websites. i know what works for me. i own many macs, and have not had a problem.
2006-01-20T11:39:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	I understand. I have tried gparted on my tibook, it didn't work.  I checked the website, and it is still reported not to work
2006-01-20T11:40:00.000Z	BastardLinux	johndarkhorse	you must have a secret to share with gparted then, yes?
