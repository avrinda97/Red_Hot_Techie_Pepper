2006-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	sokuban		what is wrong with this fstab line"/dev/sda5       /media/sda5     vfat    defaults,users,rw 0      0
2006-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	sokuban		I have a fat32 partition on sda5 and I can't even mount it with root
2006-10-20T05:46:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	what happens when you try to sudo mount it?
2006-10-20T05:47:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	I can't even mount it with root "sokuban@Arche:~$ sudo mount /media/sda5
2006-10-20T05:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	you would need to specify the filesystem type in that mount command
2006-10-20T05:49:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	I'll take a look at that thanks, (But I thought I put vfat)
2006-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	and make sure that you sudo mkdir /media/sda5 prior to mounting the device.
2006-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	Did that, and I did sudo chown sokuban
2006-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	well you don't need to chown the owner of /media/sda5
2006-10-20T05:51:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	You do if you want the user to write and mount it right?
2006-10-20T05:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	yeah i guess
2006-10-20T05:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	but once root mounts there it may change the owner back.
2006-10-20T06:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	thats fstab trying to mount it and erroring out
2006-10-20T06:02:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	yes, but when I copy the command from the tutorial, and change it to sda5 it still has the same error
2006-10-20T06:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	sudo fdisk -l         see if /dev/sda5 is showing up there.
2006-10-20T06:04:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	yes, it shows it there '/dev/sda5            5857        7132    10249438+   b  W95 FAT32
2006-10-20T06:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	okay try sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda5 /media/sda5
2006-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	doesn't work
2006-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	-t fat    ???  can't remember the correct switch  or man mount to read the documentation
2006-10-20T06:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	yeha mount -t vfat   should work.  Are you sure the partition is okay?
2006-10-20T06:06:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	err, "mount: unknown filesystem type 'fat'
2006-10-20T06:07:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	I am not sure the partition is ok. I made it with Gparted on the ubuntu live CD, it is a logical partition, I never touched it with windows.
2006-10-20T06:08:00.000Z	chuckyp	sokuban	I would check it out in gparted make sure it got formated properly
2006-10-20T06:08:00.000Z	sokuban	chuckyp	ok, I'll take a look.
