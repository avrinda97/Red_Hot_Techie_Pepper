2005-06-07T07:03:00.000Z	ubermonzie		Still does not do the work for me
2005-06-07T07:04:00.000Z	ubermonzie		KDE and GNOME both have their uses
2005-06-07T07:04:00.000Z	ubermonzie		I am working on a rural project here..
2005-06-07T07:05:00.000Z	ubermonzie		and i am trying to tune Ubuntu specifically for rural purposes including regional language support etc
2005-06-07T07:05:00.000Z	ubermonzie		Ya i kno
2005-06-07T07:05:00.000Z	ubermonzie		the ads should try a 2 cd set instead
2005-06-07T07:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	you can install kde on ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop`
2005-06-07T07:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	that's not possible ( libdvdcss etc) for legal reasons
2005-06-07T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	someone tried to distribute a CD with all extras, but had to stop
2005-06-07T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	unfortunately, some of the things you want from ubuntu are not currently possible
2005-06-07T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	I think you would still run into issues with mp3 etc ( but I am not a lawyer) :)
2005-06-07T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	I didn't mean you couldn't do things :) Just that Canonical have legal stuff to worry about...
2005-06-07T07:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	what you are doing sounds great by the way : I wish you well !
2005-06-07T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	Xfce is smaller, I guess - and better on old machines
2005-06-07T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	or icewm maybe?
2005-06-07T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	I know you know :) Just agreeing
2005-06-07T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	no, this is the help channel
2005-06-07T07:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	if you are a developer, have you tried the developers mailing list?
2005-06-07T07:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	there is also a users mailing list with quite a few knowledgeable people
2005-06-07T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	you're welcome any time, of course !
2005-06-07T07:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	the response time on the users mailing list is quite fast: it's a high traffic list
2005-06-07T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ubermonzie	great stuff !
