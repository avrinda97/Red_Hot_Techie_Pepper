2011-11-28T08:58:00.000Z	hopp3r		HI THERE, WHAT IS ubuntu?
2011-11-28T08:59:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	yes, though certain programs you move might not function
2011-11-28T08:59:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	like what programs?
2011-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	programs you install for Windows are designed to run only on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) uses an entirely different API
2011-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	many programs can still be run via a win32 api reimplementation called Wine
2011-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	many will not run, however
2011-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	what operating system do I have now?
2011-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	for those you'd want to find a native API equivalent/replacement
2011-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	no idea
2011-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	I am using chrome operating system, will that work with ubuntu?
2011-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	Chrome is Linux
2011-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	virtually anything you use in Chrome will be available from Ubuntu as well
2011-11-28T09:02:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	ok, and will I have my favorites from my chome operating system put into ubuntu too?
2011-11-28T09:02:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	you can if you like
2011-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	they should be available in the filesystem somewhere
2011-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	it might be simpler to export them from ChromeOS before the move
2011-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	you can also likely run your ChromeOS in a VM from within Ubuntu as needed
2011-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	and will I have the chrome operating system on my desktop in ubuntu too?
2011-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	you can, but I suggested it mostly as a stepping stone approach
2011-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	oh,actually I just noticed I switch off chrome operating system a while ago, I am now using firefox operating system x.x fail
2011-11-28T09:05:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	ohsorry, firefox is not my operating system. I feel so stupid now. I am using dell operating system (fail)
2011-11-28T09:06:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	heh, fail when I told you that chrome was my operating system, I didnt realize it was an actual OS
2011-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	reisio	hopp3r	next time :p
2011-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	hopp3r	reisio	heh, lemme know when you go offline to troll some other loser :p
