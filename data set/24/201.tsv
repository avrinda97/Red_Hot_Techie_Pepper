2012-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	hanslanda		same message You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.
2012-08-17T09:02:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	have you just done a dist-upgrade that has installed a new kernel by any chance?
2012-08-17T09:03:00.000Z	hanslanda		i was away about 1 month, and yesterday i made the update
2012-08-17T09:04:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	And it broke after that?
2012-08-17T09:04:00.000Z	hanslanda		yes
2012-08-17T09:04:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	reinstall the nvidia driver and watch for errors when it is generating the modules for the installed kernels.
2012-08-17T09:05:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	im sorry, im new to linux, can u help me, how can i say, a little more heavily? (sorry about my bad english)
2012-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	I can talk you through a few things that fixed my problem when I had this, but I'm no expert. Do you have a terminal window open?
2012-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	yes...
2012-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current and look for any errors when it's building modules. I'll try to find an example...
2012-08-17T09:08:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	i think it will works...its processing
2012-08-17T09:09:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	if all modules work ok, type 'uname -r' and make sure the output matches a module that has been built. Then try a reboot

2012-08-17T09:11:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	looks like there was no module but there is now. Does uname -r show that you are running 3.2.0-29 kernel?
2012-08-17T09:11:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	yesterday i made a change too...changed the language settings...it was in Portuguese, and i switched to English
2012-08-17T09:12:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	not sure if that will affect anything. Can you reply to my last question?
2012-08-17T09:12:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	3.2.0-29-generic-pae
2012-08-17T09:13:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	ok - now you can either 'sudo modprobe nvidia-current' and logout to restart X, or do a reboot. Not sure if the modprobe will work as I've never had to try it
2012-08-17T09:14:00.000Z	hanslanda		ok..i will reboot the system...see u in a few minutes..ty
2012-08-17T09:16:00.000Z	hanslanda	somsip	many thanks, now its working better than ever...thank u
2012-08-17T09:16:00.000Z	somsip	hanslanda	damn fast reboot too :-) glad it worked!
