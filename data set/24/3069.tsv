2008-05-13T01:37:00.000Z	evilbug		is there any way to run "locate <file name>" and also have it delete what it locates?
2008-05-13T01:38:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	yeah with pipes
2008-05-13T01:38:00.000Z	evilbug		xborgy- fill me in,i have no clue what that is.
2008-05-13T01:38:00.000Z	xborgy		do locate blah | rm
2008-05-13T01:38:00.000Z	xborgy		rm = the remove cmd
2008-05-13T01:38:00.000Z	evilbug		xborgy- right,didn't know what "pipes" was.thanks!
2008-05-13T01:39:00.000Z	xborgy		pipes is | to string long cmd's together
2008-05-13T01:40:00.000Z	evilbug		xborgy- so if i wanted to delete every wine-related file/dir i would do "locate wine | rm"?
2008-05-13T01:40:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	nope
2008-05-13T01:42:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	are you saying you just want to remove wine all together or the programs you installed inside of wine?
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- and that deletes everything and everything of wine?
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	evilbug	Flannel	xborgy- thanks.
2008-05-13T01:44:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	yeah so if you wanted to just uninstall apps inside of wine just type in a terminal uninstaller
2008-05-13T01:45:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- i ran a "locate wine" after that and there are still a bunch of files/dirs showing up.
2008-05-13T01:46:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- i installed it via "apt-get install wine"
2008-05-13T01:46:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- and there were a couple of apps that would just not delete.
2008-05-13T01:46:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- or uninstall.
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- they were still showing up as installed.
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	evilbug		and they would run when clicked.
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	I also recomend you to delete unneded pathlinks in /etc/ld.so.conf /usr/lib32 /usr/X11R6/lib32 /lib32
2008-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	xborgy		they are no longer needed now you uninstalled WINE, this makes your Ubuntubox more secure or so..
2008-05-13T01:48:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- nope,nothing other than install them.
2008-05-13T01:50:00.000Z	evilbug		Flannel- it's saying wine is not even installed.
2008-05-13T01:51:00.000Z	xborgy	evilbug	try sudo apt-get autoremove wine
