2005-12-24T17:35:00.000Z	shadox		other question :D  how do i install my win32 codecs. i have .deb file on my desktop
2005-12-24T17:36:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	if its an ubuntu package "sudo dpkg -i file"
2005-12-24T17:36:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	thnx i'll try
2005-12-24T17:38:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	i received an error
2005-12-24T17:39:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	thought so :) (if its not ubuntu breezy package)
2005-12-24T17:39:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	 dpkg: status database area is locked by another process
2005-12-24T17:39:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	ok, close synaptic (or other package manager)
2005-12-24T17:40:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	you can also download the tarball with the codecs and just copy them to /usr/lib/win32 (as Viper12 said)
2005-12-24T17:40:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	aha, i think i found my mistake, my ubuntu is updating, could that be the problem?
2005-12-24T17:41:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	yes :) wait until synaptic is ready
2005-12-24T17:41:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	hmm :( that will be a long time "updating 451 packages"
2005-12-24T17:41:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	ouch
2005-12-24T17:42:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	uhu
2005-12-24T09:29:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	apt-get rulez :)
2005-12-24T09:30:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	but it is hard in the beginning especially for a shadox ubuntu n00b :D
2005-12-24T09:30:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	i agree, thats why theres synaptic :)
2005-12-24T09:31:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	uhu, but i really don't get the synaptic part, there are soooo many things :s
2005-12-24T09:32:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	you mean many programs ?
2005-12-24T09:34:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	uhu, exactly
2005-12-24T09:35:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	when i try new soft, i look their site and see if its still active, then i just install and test, when i dont like it, uninstall...
2005-12-24T09:36:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	i noticed that when you'r linux user, you'r much more on your own
2005-12-24T09:36:00.000Z	shadox	oskude	like google or ubuntguide will be your 2 best friends :D
2005-12-24T09:36:00.000Z	oskude	shadox	and where do you search for windoze help ?
