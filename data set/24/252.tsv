2012-02-04T05:07:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	host system is osx snow leopard
2012-02-04T05:08:00.000Z	grubbyone		is your VM using a bridged connection?
2012-02-04T05:08:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	yes
2012-02-04T05:09:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	what IP are you trying to access?
2012-02-04T05:09:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		why?
2012-02-04T05:09:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		the one of my vm
2012-02-04T05:09:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	internal IP or internet IP?
2012-02-04T05:10:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		192.168.x.xxx
2012-02-04T05:10:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		something like that
2012-02-04T05:10:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	is your VM at work or home?
2012-02-04T05:10:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	ah, on my laptop sorry
2012-02-04T05:11:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		so that's why I find it odd that it works at work, but not at home
2012-02-04T05:11:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		I even tried to vpn into my work network
2012-02-04T05:11:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	you're trying to access it from the host?
2012-02-04T05:11:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	yes
2012-02-04T05:11:00.000Z	grubbyone		it's possible that it pulled a different IP from your home network
2012-02-04T05:12:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	ah, as defined in /etc/network/interfaces?
2012-02-04T05:13:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	is it set to DHCP or static?
2012-02-04T05:13:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		network netmask, gateway etc?
2012-02-04T05:14:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	your home router could be using the 192.168.1.x and your work could be using 192.168.0.x
2012-02-04T05:14:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	I'll look into that
2012-02-04T05:14:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	grubbyone	thanks for your feedback!
2012-02-04T05:15:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	look and see what your host internal IP is, and set the VM to use the same subnet
2012-02-04T05:15:00.000Z	grubbyone	Danny_Joris	or just set it to DHCP and then access it using the hostname
