2012-05-19T20:46:00.000Z	knutremi	kourtney_kane	I checked it now. It's changeable through the Advanced Settings application, yes. Search for "Advanced Settings" in the software center.

2012-05-19T20:48:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		can you help
2012-05-19T20:49:00.000Z	knutremi	kourtney_kane	Are you able to cite some of the information in the dependency error. Or is that all the information you got?
2012-05-19T20:49:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		gnome-session: Depends: gnome-session-bin (>= 3.2.1-0ubuntu8) but 3.2.1-0ubuntu8 is to be installed

2012-05-19T20:49:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		these are unmet dependencies
2012-05-19T20:51:00.000Z	knutremi	kourtney_kane	I never figured out how to solve those dependency errors. I guess you have another question that needs answering now. ;)
2012-05-19T20:52:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		yes, i need to change my theme to the default one
2012-05-19T20:52:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		gimp changed my theme to an odd looking one
2012-05-19T20:53:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		the font is pale yellow
2012-05-19T20:53:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		i cannot see it on white background
2012-05-19T20:53:00.000Z	knutremi		What happens if you switch between some of the additional themes in the appearance system settings?
2012-05-19T20:53:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		same problem remains
2012-05-19T20:54:00.000Z	kourtney_kane	knutremi	i tried changing the user but still the problem persists
2012-05-19T20:55:00.000Z	knutremi		Which version of Ubuntu are you using, kourtney_kane?
2012-05-19T20:56:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		oneiric
2012-05-19T20:56:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		 Linux ubuntu 3.0.0-17-generic #30-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 8 20:45:39 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2012-05-19T20:58:00.000Z	kourtney_kane		i used this command lsb_release -sc; uname -a
2012-05-19T21:01:00.000Z	knutremi	kourtney_kane	I'm out of suggestions. You could try installing a theme from http://ubuntu-art.org/index.php?xcontentmode=100 though. So guarantees that it will make things better though.
