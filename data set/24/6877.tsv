2005-06-25T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	did you run "make" first?
2005-06-25T13:28:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	hmmm i guess not
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	that might be an idea :)
2005-06-25T13:29:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	yes it sounds like a good idea
2005-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	did configure spit out any errors?
2005-06-25T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-06-25T13:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	./configure && make && checkinstall
2005-06-25T13:45:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	there the sets i followed
2005-06-25T13:46:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	i tryed again im still getting about 100 errors
2005-06-25T13:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	does "make" complete without errors ?
2005-06-25T13:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	"100 errors" doesn't tell us much - maybe you should paste the errors you get on pastebin.com or similar
2005-06-25T13:52:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	http://pastebin.com/301297
2005-06-25T13:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	looks like someone goofed: I don't know how you can get that to build
2005-06-25T13:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	the compiler doesn't like it, evidently
2005-06-25T13:55:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	yea, maybe i could email the devloper to make a .deb file for it
2005-06-25T14:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	they should be in /var/cache/apt/archives
2005-06-25T14:05:00.000Z	jesse1	thoreauputic	so all i do is copy that folder and paste it in there on my friends computer?
2005-06-25T14:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	umm... well I would read the apt-howto first if I were you ;) sudo apt-get install apt-howto
2005-06-25T14:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jesse1	type file:///usr/share/doc/Debian/apt-howto/apt-howto.en.html in your browser to read the howto when it's installed
