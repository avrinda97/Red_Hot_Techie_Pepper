2008-01-15T19:25:00.000Z	xomp		Hello, would anyone know if there is a linux mail client that will work with Exchange Server 5.5?
2008-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	evolution
2008-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	evolution works with 2000/2003, not 5.5
2008-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	not even with the connector?
2008-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	this is the first I've heard of a connector, please explain :D
2008-01-15T19:27:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	google it
2008-01-15T19:27:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	evolution connector
2008-01-15T19:27:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	thanks a million ;)
2008-01-15T19:30:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	the connector seems to be for Exchange 2000/2003 as well (and shows as being installed on my current setup)
2008-01-19T23:03:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	what chip?
2008-01-19T23:04:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	I'm not sure what chip. Is there a way to find out? the laptop I use is an Compaq evo N610c
2008-01-19T23:04:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	lspci
2008-01-19T23:05:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82845 845 [Brookdale] Chipset Host Bridge (rev 04)
2008-01-19T23:05:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	a host bridge is no vga chip...
2008-01-19T23:06:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	I'm sorry, I thought I posted the graphics info earlier, is that what you're asking?
2008-01-19T23:06:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	yes
2008-01-19T23:06:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 7500] [1002:4c57]
2008-01-19T23:06:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	driver is "radeon" or "ati"
2008-01-19T23:07:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	not sure mate.
2008-01-19T23:07:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	but I am
2008-01-19T23:08:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	I don't think I understand lol. Am I to download ati/radeon drivers you say? Or?
2008-01-19T23:10:00.000Z	erawfish	xomp	you already have all drivers on your disk without installing another thing. "radeon" is the open source drivers for radeons. fglrx from ati.com will NOT work on your chip
2008-01-19T23:10:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	thanks so much! I was nearly going to install the fglrx lol. So I'm cool with the drivers i have now, wonderful :)
2008-01-19T23:10:00.000Z	xomp	erawfish	tis a load off my mind
