2007-11-17T21:17:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	it's also possible to run one system within another. It's called virtualization. VMWare is a good example.
2007-11-17T21:18:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	yes, but windows vista eats the whole system...can you imagine running linux inside windows vista?
2007-11-17T21:19:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	depends on the available resources, of course, but it should be ok as long as you have enough ram.
2007-11-17T21:20:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	mmm not enough for that windows sh!@# only 1 GB
2007-11-17T21:20:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	and you really need vista?
2007-11-17T21:22:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	if you don't really need vista, I'd seriously consider switching to ubuntu...
2007-11-17T21:22:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	but dual-boot might also be a very good option if you decide you want both.
2007-11-17T21:22:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	Ubuntu is the OS i use, but in my job i cant have linux installed in my laptop
2007-11-17T21:23:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	you can't have linux installed, or you have to have windows installed?
2007-11-17T21:23:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	i cant have linux installed
2007-11-17T21:24:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	well, then you might want to consider running it in a virtual machine. That's probably the best choice.
2007-11-17T21:25:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	ok ok...i will check this supergrub and try to boot from a cd, or a usb, or something like that
2007-11-17T21:25:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	no..
2007-11-17T21:25:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	mmm why no?
2007-11-17T21:25:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	I meant a virtual machine, not dual-boot. Wait, I'll show you.

2007-11-17T21:33:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	i will look that immediately...thanks a lot!
2007-11-17T21:36:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	ok man, that is a very, very good thing...now the question is: is there any free virtual machine i can use? what do you use?
2007-11-17T21:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	there are several. Some are gratis, like vmware server that I use, and some are libre. I have no problem with recommending vmware.
2007-11-17T21:38:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	you might want to use vmware player.
2007-11-17T21:38:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	Teknomancer thanks a lot!
2007-11-17T21:39:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Jessid	you're welcome. And good luck :)
2007-11-17T21:39:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	I will need it, jejejeje!
2007-11-17T23:44:00.000Z	Jessid	XiXaQ	it is me again...I have installed vmware player, but I see that i need a preconfigured virtual machine how can i create it? thanks
