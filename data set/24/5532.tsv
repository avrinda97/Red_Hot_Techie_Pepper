2006-08-07T14:44:00.000Z	alxarch		I am startin a series of seminars grom september to promote open source software in my university
2006-08-07T14:45:00.000Z	alxarch		yes but without linux on the computers there no much I can do, can anyone help me?
2006-08-07T14:46:00.000Z	alxarch		the alternate cd what kinds of installation modes does it have?
2006-08-07T14:47:00.000Z	alxarch		the problem is I want to install ubuntu on 40 machines without having to go manually in each one, selecting packages, preferences etc
2006-08-07T14:47:00.000Z	alxarch		the problem with the oem install is that it asks the user for username etc. in the lab the usernames are stored in the active directory server.
2006-08-07T14:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	To identify installed packages and create a list to reinstall Use Terminal type dpkg --get-selections > myprog.txt to reinstall type dpkg --get-selections < myprog.txt
2006-08-07T14:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	No script needed.
2006-08-07T14:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	The basic install would need to be done on each maching due to probable hardware differences, then use the master myprog file to load your prefered packages
2006-08-07T14:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	that dpkg command generates a list of all installed packages..  a script for reinstallation if you want to call it that
2006-08-07T14:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	the same way the sources can point to the install cd you can point them anywhere
2006-08-07T15:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	Modify your sources list ... gksudo gedit  /etc/apt/sources.list   to include your file server
2006-08-07T15:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	Look at the livecd and the repos for that
2006-08-07T15:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	fyi it helps to put the persons nick at the front so their irc client will highlight the line for them.. type the first few letters then hit tab
2006-08-07T15:07:00.000Z	alxarch	Jack_Sparrow	thnks 4 the tip
2006-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	alxarch	Jack_Sparrow	I always wondered HOW fast can these people write?
2006-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	plus the hightlighting helps alot
2006-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	alxarch	Jack_Sparrow	does gaim has this option?
2006-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	yes
2006-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alxarch	Most clients do
2006-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	alxarch	Jack_Sparrow	well I don"t see anything highlited, anyway any ideas for the script?
