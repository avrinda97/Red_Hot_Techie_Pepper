2007-12-25T15:09:00.000Z	piyush		Failed to run users-admin as user root.
2007-12-25T15:09:00.000Z	piyush		The underlying authorization mechanism (sudo) does not allow you to run this program. Contact the system administrator.
2007-12-25T15:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	What happens when you run "gksudo true" in a terminal?
2007-12-25T15:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	What is the output of "sudo -l" ?
2007-12-25T15:12:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	n then gives same error
2007-12-25T15:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	Did you see my second question?
2007-12-25T15:13:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	no  o k
2007-12-25T15:14:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	 : )   Sorry, user piyush may not run sudo on piyush-Ndian.
2007-12-25T15:14:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	 but it was working fine till yesterday :)
2007-12-25T15:15:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	 ok i m trying b sudoer now
2007-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	cheese man file is too big...
2007-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	You need to add your user to the admin group, if you can't use sudo from any user ( or log in as root directly, which you shouldn't do generally ) then you will need to run "adduser piyush admin" from single user mode ( recovery mode at the boot prompt )
2007-12-25T15:17:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	ok
2007-12-25T15:18:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	so are we adding new user or giving the same user privileges of root??
2007-12-25T15:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	Giving your user admin privileges
2007-12-25T15:20:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	ok
2007-12-25T15:20:00.000Z	piyush	Jordan_U	i`ll b back  ven i m done
2007-12-25T15:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	"adduser piyush admin" didn't work?
2007-12-25T15:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	What did you do if anything significant before sudo stopped working?
2007-12-25T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	What won't work?
2007-12-25T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	piyush	There is almost certainly a way to solve it, you just need to be made a sudoer, but I am trying to figure out why you don't have an admin group
