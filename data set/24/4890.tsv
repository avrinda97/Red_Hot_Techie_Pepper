2007-01-10T16:15:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	so setting them to 0 is good enough?
2007-01-10T16:10:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	add it to /etc/fstab
2007-01-10T16:11:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	ty oh k can u tell me if this format is right? /dev/hda4  /media/opensuse ext3 defaults 0 0 ( I am not sure abt the zeros)
2007-01-10T16:12:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	there must be at least one space between all components, otherwise it looks okay
2007-01-10T16:13:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	it's easy to check though - save /etc/fstab and run "sudo mount /dev/hda4"
2007-01-10T16:13:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	what are the zeroes for?
2007-01-10T16:14:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	they have to do with filesystem checking at boot and arcane backups - man fstab, man mount, but the only one you might ever want to set is the first one, for fschecking
2007-01-10T16:15:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	set it to a value larger than the root partition has, as the value indicates the order in which partitions are checked
2007-01-10T16:15:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	well, setting the fscheck to 0 means it won't be checked on boot
2007-01-10T16:16:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	what do u suggest I put there?
2007-01-10T16:17:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	well, look through the rest of the file - the root partition is set to 1 and the others are set to 2 - so either set yours to 2 or higher, like 3
2007-01-10T16:17:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	bTW it's the second o, but the file has comments to indicate this
2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	all my partitions have "0 0"
2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	they do ? what version are you running ? they should not
2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	version?
2007-01-10T16:19:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	run "uname -a"
2007-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	cmiuc007	adaptr	mwe:Linux 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Fri Oct 13 18:45:35 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux (this is a clean install so the updaes have been applied but not yet reebotted)
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	you are probably not reading the file correctly; pastebin the contents
2007-01-10T16:25:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	/               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
2007-01-10T16:25:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	the last line is also fine - now do what I told you to
2007-01-10T16:26:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	use "0 2"
2007-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	same there, obviously
2007-01-10T16:28:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	no, as I said, it is the order in which they are checked
2007-01-10T16:29:00.000Z	adaptr	cmiuc007	so you always want a 1 for the root partition, and can use 2 for all others; IF the system supports running multiple checks in parallel then it will do so, else it will just check them one at a time
