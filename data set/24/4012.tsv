2007-08-06T07:47:00.000Z	Azis		Li'll question:  What is the name of  the "Mozilla SUITE"  for  apt-get  or aptitude?
2007-08-06T07:47:00.000Z	Azis		I can only find firefox
2007-08-06T07:47:00.000Z	Azis		but I need the mozila suite
2007-08-06T07:48:00.000Z	Azis		I wanna get the browser "Mozilla"  which contains a WYSIWYG Editor (the composer)
2007-08-06T07:49:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	that's old and defunct
2007-08-06T07:49:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	Seamonkey is the new one
2007-08-06T07:49:00.000Z	Azis	macogw	but I need the composer
2007-08-06T07:49:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	right, but what you want is Seamonkey, not Mozilla
2007-08-06T07:49:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	the suite is Seamonkey, the "just browser" is Firefox
2007-08-06T07:50:00.000Z	Azis	macogw	 "aptitude search seamonkey"  does NOT return any results
2007-08-06T07:50:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	must not be in the repos
2007-08-06T07:53:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	there was an editor called Nvu based on Mozilla Composer
2007-08-06T07:53:00.000Z	Azis	macogw	yep but its also not in the repos
2007-08-06T07:54:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	oh
2007-08-06T07:54:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	well there are other wysiwygs in there
2007-08-06T07:54:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	however
2007-08-06T07:54:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	nvu's most recent release was Nvu Kompozer
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	and there are Ubuntu packages
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	Azis	macogw	where can I find them?
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	go to http://www.kompozer.net and there's a button on the right
2007-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	Azis	macogw	Nutubuntu:  I installed  kompozer successfully  but the command to start it seems not to be "kompozer"
2007-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	it didnt show in your menus?
2007-08-06T08:06:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	add it back just for the sake of figuring it out
2007-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	macogw	Azis	well it is a release of nvu so i guess that makes sense
