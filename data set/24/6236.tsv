2009-05-05T21:04:00.000Z	mweichert		any idea how to make linux reset all device nodes? I only have two nics and they are detected as eth2 and eth3... I'm not sure why not eth0 and eth1
2009-05-05T21:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	check this file --> /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
2009-05-05T21:13:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	perfect... what would be the consequences of setting no persistent names?
2009-09-04T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	use /dev/disk/by-uuid/ or /dev/disk/by-label/ or /dev/disk/by-id/ .... etc
2009-09-04T19:43:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	I thought of that, but my USB drives are not listed in /dev/disk/by-uuid
2009-09-04T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	well from reading the man page i do not think mdadm accepts anything but dev nodes
2009-09-04T19:45:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	ok thanks. That's what I found too but thought maybe there was something else I could try
2009-09-04T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	maybe you can create/modify some udev rules to assing persistent dev nodes to your usb disks. that would be what you want
2009-09-04T19:47:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	yes, I asked about that a while back but I was told that it was likely impossible
2009-09-04T19:47:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	but that would surely make things easier
2009-09-04T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	i do not see why this would be impossible,,,
2009-09-04T19:56:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	actually the system I'll be using this setup on uses hotplug, not udev
2009-09-25T18:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	mdadm is for the md subsystem and lvm2 is for the md subsystem of the kernel... and yes there is some overlapping in funcionality between the two (both can do levels of raid but dm has other uses)
2009-09-25T18:37:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	is one better than the other?
2009-09-25T18:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	i can not say i gues that all depends on what you want to do
2009-09-25T18:39:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	well, ultimately I want a soft raid solution that offers the most flexibility and support
2009-09-25T18:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	got for mdadm then
2009-09-25T18:40:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	curious... why?
2009-09-25T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	mdadm only does raid is more focused and widely used afaik
2009-09-25T18:42:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	I notice that most distribution installers have LVM2 support - but I never see mention of mdadm
2009-09-25T18:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	may be becouse lvm2/dm has more features (like encryption; dm-multipath; snapshot etc)
2009-09-25T19:18:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	just came across EVMS as well... how does this compare to LVM2?
2009-09-25T19:18:00.000Z	mweichert	erUSUL	is it widely supported by Linux installers yet?
2009-09-25T19:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	mweichert	evms is built on top lvm/lvm2 (just an interface) and i thought it was abandoned
