2005-02-09T07:57:00.000Z	shingoki		Anyone know about totem? its just I assume that at some point it has worked for someone, but I've never actually seen it play a file - it always says the plugin isn't available or something
2005-02-09T07:59:00.000Z	shingoki		They should support mplayer ;)
2005-02-09T07:59:00.000Z	shingoki		its not like totem is eer going to work ;)
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	shingoki		ok... install totem-xine => remove ubuntu-desktop, that doesn't seem good
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	shingoki		oh ok, fair enough
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	shingoki		I dunno what "support" means anyway
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	shingoki		thats irritating
2005-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	shingoki		I can't see why they stick with totem when it is so very bad, everything else is great apart from video playback
2005-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	shingoki		seems easier just to install xine
2005-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	shingoki		or gxine
2005-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	shingoki	all they do is put it in a repo that is not supported
2005-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	shingoki		yeah but what I mean is, why support totem, which is useless, rather than gxine, which does everything?
2005-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	shingoki	the repo is not added in the default intall
2005-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	kbrooks		you add it
2005-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	shingoki		it just leads to a load of people getting frustrated that they can't play video
2005-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	shingoki		yup I've sorted it out, I just don't understand why totem is supported but not a video player that actually plays videos :) Anyway, doesn't matter, its easy to fix
2005-02-09T08:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	shingoki	dude
2005-02-09T08:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	shingoki	totem is not supported because it is in a repository that is not supported
2005-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	shingoki	kbrooks	totem is installed by default ...
2005-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	kbrooks	shingoki	no it isnt
2005-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	kbrooks		and wont be
2005-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	kbrooks		and wont
2005-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	kbrooks		and shall not
2005-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	shingoki	kbrooks	oh. So where did I get it from on the live cd?
