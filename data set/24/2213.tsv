2010-08-21T20:35:00.000Z	terrence		I'm trying to get Totem Movie player to play youtube files
2010-08-21T20:35:00.000Z	terrence		Is there anyone who has it working on 10.4
2010-08-21T20:37:00.000Z	terrence		Can't play youtube on my movie player
2010-08-21T20:37:00.000Z	terrence		any help?
2010-08-21T20:38:00.000Z	terrence		I tried a few help guides, but they don't work
2010-08-21T20:38:00.000Z	terrence		coz, do you have a youtube.py file in usr/lib/totem/plugins/youtub
2010-08-21T20:39:00.000Z	terrence		coz, do you have a youtube.py file in usr/lib/totem/plugins/youtube I mean
2010-08-21T20:40:00.000Z	terrence		I figure if I can find the file I can apply the Ubuntu 9 patch
2010-08-21T20:42:00.000Z	xangua	terrence	you mean with totem¿
2010-08-21T20:42:00.000Z	terrence		thanks Jordan_U
2010-08-21T20:43:00.000Z	terrence		yes xangua
2010-08-21T20:43:00.000Z	xangua		well...it's broken terrence
2010-08-21T20:43:00.000Z	xangua		wait until maverick release
2010-08-21T20:43:00.000Z	xangua		or you can try a PPA, under your own risk terrence
2010-08-21T20:43:00.000Z	terrence		OK - is there any other player that works for youtube in the meantime
2010-08-21T20:44:00.000Z	terrence	xangua	Whats a PPA
2010-08-21T20:44:00.000Z	terrence		Thanks - will give that a try
2010-08-21T20:44:00.000Z	terrence		thanks Xangua
2010-08-21T20:45:00.000Z	xangua	terrence	another¿ you can also try minitube
2010-08-21T20:45:00.000Z	terrence	xangua	I've tried minitube, but get a different error
2010-08-21T20:45:00.000Z	xangua	terrence	both minitube and totem updates that work again with youtube are in this PPA that acumulates a lot more of other program updates https://launchpad.net/~guido-iodice/+archive/guiodiclucid
2010-08-21T20:46:00.000Z	terrence		Xangua thanks a mil . I'll try and come back to let you know how it ent
2010-08-21T20:48:00.000Z	xangua	terrence	if something goes wrong with that ppa you can rollback with ppa-purge, do you have ppa-purge in your system¿
