2011-04-12T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	what is the output of:  lsb_release -d
2011-04-12T22:56:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Ubuntu 10.10
2011-04-12T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	you can use kwin which can provide compoziting, metacity can too

2011-04-12T23:02:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Trying one of the solutions in that article now; rebooting.
2011-04-12T23:07:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	... WEIRD flickering occurs when I try to enable even basic Compiz effects.
2011-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Okay, I think it's safe to say that Compiz is out. What exactly does Metacity provide? (It's already on my system.)
2011-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	it can do compoziting but I'm personally unsure how to enable it, have a sniff around the web
2011-04-12T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	what cpu speed, ram amount and gpu do you have?
2011-04-12T23:22:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Also, what was the other composting manager you named?
2011-04-12T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	kwin in kde can do compositing
2011-04-12T23:27:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Ah, okay.
2011-04-12T23:27:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	ATM I don't feel like installing another desktop environment. :)
2011-04-12T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	don't blame you
2011-04-12T23:28:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Looks like the only way to enable Metacity's composting for now is through gconf-editor.
2011-04-12T23:35:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Unfortunately, even Metacity's barebones effects couldn't really be shown on my laptop, and I noticed a bothersome slowdown.
2011-04-12T23:37:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	An Intel Centrino clocked at 1.7 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, and an "Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)" for the GPU.
2011-04-12T23:37:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	The laptop itself goes by the model of a Dell Inspiron 700m.
2011-04-12T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L-Strife89	may help http://www.linlap.com/wiki/dell+inspiron+700m

2011-04-12T23:47:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	I'm feeling good about that thread on the forums ... rebooting.
2011-04-13T00:03:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	... Well, so much for success. X refused to start at all with those xorg.conf settings.
2011-04-13T00:04:00.000Z	L-Strife89	ActionParsnip	Ultimately I renamed the file.
