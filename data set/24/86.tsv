2012-10-25T01:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	Boot a cd and see if it runs.
2012-10-25T01:19:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	well that runs.. i can install it, but whenever i try to install the ati video drivers (with the sources - thing) .. and reboot .. it goes to .. hell.. wont boot or no unity & nothing on screen..
2012-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	I see problems with that on google have you tried a thread at the ubuntu forums
2012-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	I suspect a PPA might be out there with something for you but I'm not real up on graphic drivers, I have yet to have to mess with them.'
2012-10-25T01:28:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	what is a ppa?
2012-10-25T01:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	this gives a outline. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas
2012-10-25T01:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	THey are basically 3rd party repos for situations just like yours.
2012-10-25T01:31:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	for the card..you mean?
2012-10-25T01:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	Basically for tweaked apps that are past release to a specific release and drivers etc.
2012-10-25T01:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	There are a handful of reasons a person might start a PPA, I think basically that a app is not working or can be improved among other reasons.
2012-10-25T01:34:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	oh, misunderstood you :) but ..stil..cant use the ati drivers for the video
2012-10-25T01:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	What I was trying to do is pass on the options you might have but have not tried or realized. You have given little or no real info that will get you here as of now.
2012-10-25T01:37:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	yeah, cause im not amused that i needed to reinstall ubuntu like 5 times, since.. everytime i'll try to use the ati driver (with the sources thingie) .. it wont load unity and nothing on the boot  or i get a black screen
2012-10-25T01:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	It is a matter of using the right tools and knowledge of what is available in this distro, I have the feeling you are a new open source user.
2012-10-25T01:39:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	i somehow could do it on the previous ubuntu release..
2012-10-25T01:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	I think as gordonjcp suggests the support is nominal, and I believe even less now from what I have seen on this channel.
2012-10-25T01:41:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	well i have no intention to buy another graphics card
2012-10-25T01:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	If you had 12.04 running I would use it, the support is 5 years longer then 12.10.
2012-10-25T01:44:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	well i guess so :( meh too bad.. need to have the ati driver, and i saw that even the manual install isnt supported on the 12.10 right?
2012-10-25T01:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	Manual meaning a text instal?
2012-10-25T01:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	The problem here is with the manufactures in the end, whether they support open source.
2012-10-25T01:48:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	"Installing Catalyst Manually (from AMD/ATI's site) CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED.The latest version of Catalyst offered on AMD's website is Catalyst 12-9 beta. This version does not support Xserver 1.13 and it will not work on Ubuntu Quantal/12.10 because Quantal uses Xserver 1.13. Instead, use the fglrx package found in Ubuntu's repository, which is patched to work with Xserver 1.13."
2012-10-25T01:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NuSuey	And that suggestion is where you are having problems I assume. The web info I saw when looking seemed to suggest something like that. Honestly I would just use 12.04 there is hardly any difference then 12.10, other then some false street cred. ;)
2012-10-25T01:53:00.000Z	NuSuey	wilee-nilee	guess i'll do that
