2007-07-03T08:33:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	might be a good idea to not load the entire collection at once; depending on your hardware things could get slow - better to symlink to the ones you want for a particular job from ~/.fonts I would think
2007-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	|capirra		ohh i was going to copy everything into that directory :D
2007-07-03T08:34:00.000Z	|capirra		hehe thx for the advice
2007-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	|capirra		a directory inside ./font works too ?
2007-07-03T08:35:00.000Z	|capirra		or do they need to be directly installed into ./font ?
2007-07-03T08:36:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	yes it does. experiment a bit if need be; it's straightforward. for instance you could build a directory of symlinks to the particular font files for "this book we're doing" and cp it into ~/.fonts when you're actually working that project ... delete or mv the directory out of ~/.fonts when you don't need them (and that way they don't make a huge dropdown mess everytime you look for an individual font too)
2007-07-03T08:36:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	"yes" meaning directories under ~/.fonts work fine
2007-07-03T08:37:00.000Z	|capirra		cool thank you alot!
2007-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		y/w :) ... are you a typographer, by chance? or a printer, or a type designer or arrighiphile or such?
2007-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	|capirra		im a designer and web dev. yeah
2007-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	|capirra		trying to build a pipeline using ubuntu
2007-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	|capirra		but i dont design types
2007-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	|capirra		too time consuming :)
2007-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	best of luck - I'm unclear on the production process so I'm just guessing at "pipeline" but I would think you'll find what you want - this is a very friendly and flexible environment :)
2007-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Oh - and if you have a huge envy-inspiring type library, you might want something like opcion or gfontview to help visually select the right face ... |capirra
2007-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	|capirra		ahhh nice :)
2007-07-03T08:44:00.000Z	|capirra	Nutubuntu	yeah there exist a few things that i need to test before i can change completly to ubuntu
2007-07-03T08:45:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	 that would be wise - it took me a few months to cut over completely, but it's been a couple of years now and I haven't had to boot another OS except at other people's computers :)
2007-07-03T08:45:00.000Z	|capirra		:)
2007-07-03T08:46:00.000Z	|capirra	Nutubuntu	yep the most annoying problem that i have now is that gimp dont draw brush strokes smooth when i use my wacom tablet
2007-07-03T08:47:00.000Z	|capirra		when i move the pen a little bit faster then the strokes get corners and dont look like a smooth curve
2007-07-03T08:49:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	with tablet issues I'd be purely guessing, and not guessing intelligently either. Bet there's a gimp chan, though ... maybe someone there's found that issue and fixed it
2007-07-03T08:50:00.000Z	|capirra		yeah they told me that its their interpolation code
2007-07-03T08:50:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	|capirra	and of course there *is* a gimp chan, and in a shocking development it's called #gimp ... figures ;p
