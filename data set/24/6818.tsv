2005-07-15T08:31:00.000Z	weiers		Sorry for the stupid question, but I downloaded Adobe 7 in tar.gz format. I extracted it to /home/weiers/AdobeReader and now I want to run the INSTALL script. How do I do that?
2005-07-15T08:32:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	you need to open a terminal and go to that directory
2005-07-15T08:32:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	... I did that
2005-07-15T08:32:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	is there no README or INSTALL document in it?
2005-07-15T08:33:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	are you ./running ./the ./INSTALL?
2005-07-15T08:34:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	then chmod +x <install script>
2005-07-15T08:36:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	sorry... I am sure I am just doing something strange
2005-07-15T08:37:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	you need to type ./<name of install script>
2005-07-15T08:39:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	your commands in linux are in a path
2005-07-15T08:40:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	commands not in the path have to be executed in a special way
2005-07-15T08:40:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	placing a ./  <which means "right here" in linux> tells the OS to execute that particular thing
2005-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	even tho its not in the path of commmand
2005-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	before I came to this forum I saw somewhere that I could have chmod 555 or something... would that have put it into the path permanently.
2005-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	no it would not
2005-07-15T08:44:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	... thanks... I won't take more of your time, but if it type "export PATH=$PATH: ./AdobeReader/ " I would probably have been able to put it there permanently?.... Anyway. I am learning slowly every day... just saw this on the website that made no sense to me before I came here.
2005-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	depends on where you put that "export PATH" line in
2005-10-13T11:55:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	you need w32codecs first
2005-10-13T11:56:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	I think I have them because I have been playing them on Totem
2005-10-13T12:05:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	gstreamer works pretty good overall
2005-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	thank you very much for the bash script. It seems I have access to my Fat32 drive, and it mounted my NTFS partion as well, although that one is only read only. Can I now rename the drives to be more descriptive of what I use them for?
2005-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	see "man fstab"
2005-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	or symlink the mounted drives into your home folder with names YOU like
2005-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	weiers	nalioth	I'll play around a bit. This has made my life very simple. I've read the manual pages on chown - but they did not tell me that it does not work on windows drives.
2005-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	nalioth	weiers	just symlink the drives from /media to your $HOMEDIR and name the symlinks what you want. I use this method
