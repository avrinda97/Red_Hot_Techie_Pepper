2005-06-26T15:08:00.000Z	drigloi	bl4cktone	have you checked ubuntuguide.org?
2005-06-26T15:08:00.000Z	drigloi	bl4cktone	there's a section about sound config there
2005-06-26T15:08:00.000Z	bl4cktone	drigloi	I'll check it
2005-06-26T15:11:00.000Z	bl4cktone	drigloi	that would be under hardware right? think I remember something there now but having trouble finding it

2005-06-26T15:30:00.000Z	bl4cktone	drigloi	nope I think it makes him turn left evenmore when I have it down
