2005-11-17T10:05:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	I ran nvidia.com's drivers...
2005-11-17T10:12:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	no prob with that
2005-11-17T10:53:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	actually, I am in the US, and my ubuntu has dvd and mp3 support. law be damned in that respect, draconian POS's.
2005-11-17T11:00:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	dual-booter. /dev/sda for stability,  /dev/sdb for experimentation
2005-11-17T11:02:00.000Z	dducko	adriyel	well I didnt do it on purpose, i tried another distro (aLinux) that wiped my windows partion without asking.  So i tossed that cd and installed Ubuntu
2005-11-17T11:02:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	heh, aLinux sucks.
2005-11-17T11:02:00.000Z	adriyel	dducko	the dev's of that distro are somewhat arrogant though
2005-11-17T11:03:00.000Z	dducko	adriyel	I was still learning.. heh. I had just spent a day in a command line with Gentoo,  got a Xserver up and running... decided i didnt want to wait 24 hours for Gnome to compile..
