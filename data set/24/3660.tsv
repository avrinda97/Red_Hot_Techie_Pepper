2007-11-25T19:24:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	type dmesg see if its detected first
2007-11-25T19:25:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	why you dont want to emulate it?
2007-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	windows proprietary software code deems that an emulated system requires a registered licence. Which was under my laptop.. Which was stolen.
2007-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	its just a small thing that you are interested in and this is not a majority call so i guess if you get virtualbox !virtualbox and install windows xp and have it loaded from virtualbox
2007-11-25T19:27:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	so in other words.. go back to windows.
2007-11-25T19:27:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	whats the difference between using it on windows box .. or using it in vmware?
2007-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	that is illegal though?>
2007-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	you will still be in ubuntu :) , and believe me i never want to go back to windows again
2007-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	isnt that illegal?
2007-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	what does football have to do with the windows EULA
2007-11-25T19:32:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	yes but its EXPIRED lol!

2007-11-25T19:33:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	cant it be obvious that book of numbers have mistakes?
2007-11-25T19:33:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	thats besides the point.
2007-11-25T19:33:00.000Z	tntCry	neopsyche	well i was a Christian but now im a revert
2007-11-25T19:36:00.000Z	neopsyche	tntCry	I was using the bible as an example of how rediculous the proprietary thing has gotten.. but I think if you want to discuss religion .. you should take it somewhere else.. regarding the misteaks etc.. check out this ebook.. http://www.tractsforfree.com/Fossilized_Customs.pdf I found it interesting.. (but talk about this stuff somewhere else other than #ubuntu 'support channel')
