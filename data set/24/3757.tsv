2008-10-08T20:05:00.000Z	snot		I'm trying to install ubuntu server edition on a box of mine. However can't find dmraid on the cd... also I dont have dpkg in my path
2008-10-08T20:05:00.000Z	snot		anyone know how I can activate ym raids?
2008-10-08T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	I strongly advise against using fake raid
2008-10-08T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	very strongly
2008-10-08T20:05:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	it's hardware raid
2008-10-08T20:06:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	I usually just activate it with dmraid -ya
2008-10-08T20:06:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	yes
2008-10-08T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	that is not hardware raid
2008-10-08T20:06:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	I already configured my box with hardware raid (a second one as well)
2008-10-08T20:07:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	but I cant see it
2008-10-08T20:07:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	on debian etch I did
2008-10-08T20:07:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	but what do I need then?
2008-10-08T20:07:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	I belive you active them the same way
2008-10-08T20:09:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	so even though I go into the bios like menu for configuring raid devices and create a volumn by a given name and then later on activate that device using dmraid -ya... it's some sort of software raid?
2008-10-08T20:13:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	you still there?
2008-10-08T20:24:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	no response?
2008-10-08T20:24:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	so even though I go into the bios like menu for configuring raid devices and create a volumn by a given name and then later on activate that device using dmraid -ya... it's some sort of software raid?
2008-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	but what should I use then?
2008-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	that is a software raid called "fakeraid"
2008-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	use software raid
2008-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	not fake raid
2008-10-08T20:25:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	I dont get it, my mother board supports raid... why nmot use that?
2008-10-08T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	snot	because its fake raid, and thats a terrible technology, even worse in linux
2008-10-08T20:26:00.000Z	snot	ikonia	ok
