2005-10-18T09:40:00.000Z	looga		hello all: I have japanese text/typing support enabled on my ubuntu. in the upgrade installation process, I'm getting many messages about this. Please take a look at the pertinent output at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3037. What shoudl i do?
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	adwait	looga	no
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	adwait	looga	tht will just tell you more about the problem
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	looga	adwait	so when should i run that command? and how should i fix this problem?
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	adwait	looga	its not really a problem....u just need to import the keys which have been used to sign the software
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	adwait	looga	you can just ignore the warning......no big deal reallly
2005-10-18T09:43:00.000Z	looga	adwait	glad to hear it's not a problem. what do you mean that i just have to import the keys? How do i import the keys to ALL The programs that are giving this warning? you said I can ignore it? What're the repercussions for ignoring it?
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	adwait	looga	basically, the programs are signed by encryption keys so that you can be sure that the software is clean. Now, you need to import the keys (small text files) so that your computer can verify against the signature in the software
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	looga	adwait	so you mean it's got nothing to do with having my locale set to Japan or Japanese or something?
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	adwait	looga	so if u ignore, ur computer can't verify but goes ahead with the install, shouldn't be a problem since you are using ubuntu repositories
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	adwait	looga	NO
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	looga	adwait	you mean even people using only English language stuff on their computers have the warning , too?
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	adwait	looga	yes, probably if they haven't imported the appropriate keys
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	looga	adwait	pardon my ignorance. what do you mean by "keys"? passwords?
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	looga	adwait	oh, i just re-read what you wrote.
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	adwait	looga	no, not exactly passwords.......they contain information about HOW a file has been encrypted and hence how to decrypt it........basically they are sort of a digital signature
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	looga	adwait	i think i krnow what you mean by "keys" now.
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	adwait	looga	:)
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	looga	adwait	dooglus, did you import your keys?
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	looga	adwait	dooglus, I'd like to get things as smooth as i can?
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	adwait	looga	I normally just ignore the warning :p.......i just imported the jonathan ridell key, in order to install KDE beta
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	looga	adwait	so you need keys if you want to install some programs?
2005-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	adwait	looga	certain programs won't let u install unless u import the keys.....but kde beta was the first one i came across
2005-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	looga	adwait	in that case, i want to do what it takes to fix this "keys" problem.
