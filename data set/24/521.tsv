2012-02-29T08:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	mame is probably the best neogeo emulator out there, gngeo is ok to (and supports the home console like options)
2012-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	the mame version in the repos doesn't work, and GnGeo is a long dead project
2012-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	if you claim both mame and mednafen "don't work" perhaps they're not the issue.  good luck.
2012-02-29T08:55:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	mednafen launches and loads the rom, but gets stuck in a constant loop of configuring keys, the version of mame in the repos launches, but crashes when you do anything, I can't even get it to load a bios or a rom
2012-02-29T08:56:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	I've had the same kind of issues with bsnes and zsnes, neither of those runs either, zsnes crashes silently and bsnes launches, doesn't load a rom and doesn't do anything till manually killed
2012-02-29T08:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	well, sdlmame (if available in ubuntu) is a big improvement over xmame -- but neither is "easy" to setup.
2012-02-29T08:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	are you using ati graphics by chance?
2012-02-29T08:57:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	sdlmame is what I've got, nope, Nvidia Geforce 6200 NV44a core
2012-02-29T09:21:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	I take it you had no luck either? I did find a ppa for SNES9x which works for SNES, but that still does nothing for the lack of NeoGeo emulation
2012-02-29T09:22:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	so long as your on 32bit zsnes is certainy my favourite snes emulator.  For neo-geo I think sdlmame is probably one of the best options.  good luck.
2012-02-29T09:24:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	yeah I'm on 32 bit, but as I said, zsnes instantly crashes and bsnes launches but doesn't display anything, just runs invisibly eating resources silently till it's manually killed
2012-02-29T09:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	well, i don't run ubuntu - so can't really comment on stability issues on your distro
2012-02-29T09:26:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	mint? debian?
2012-02-29T09:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	doesn't matter ;)  it's ot.  Not mint for sure.
2012-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	you're missing the key, i take it you didn't use add-apt-repository (or similar) command to add the repo
2012-04-01T07:25:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	weird, when I added the ppas months ago the software installed, any way to tell what PPAs they are from the error?
2012-04-01T07:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	one is a PPA the other is tridex.net?  sorry no further suggestions, you could google the keys to find the repos probably.
2012-04-01T07:30:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	Tridex would be the official Mate desktop repo.
2012-04-01T07:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	i see.  3rd party repos seem silly to me (i consider PPAs 3rd party BTW)
2012-04-01T07:34:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	I'm guessing the others are Snes9x and the Pithos PPA, the version of Pithos in the Ubuntu repos can't connect to the Pandora server and Snes9x is so far the only working SNES emulator I could find...
2012-04-01T07:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	snes on 64bit is a big issue for me personally ;)
2012-04-01T07:35:00.000Z	intok	zykotick9	you wouldn't happen to know of a working MAME emulator would you?
2012-04-01T07:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	sdlmame is more modern then xmame, i can say that for sure ;)
2012-04-01T07:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	intok	sdlmame is the best neogeo emulator, period ;)
