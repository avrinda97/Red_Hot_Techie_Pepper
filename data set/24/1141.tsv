2010-11-25T06:34:00.000Z	janisozaur		how do I disable password prompt for certain action?
2010-11-25T06:36:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	its asking for the password for a good reason :)
2010-11-25T06:36:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	I'm aware of that. but that is not an answer to my question.
2010-11-25T06:37:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	I wasnt answering your question more making a point
2010-11-25T06:37:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	then consider me aware of your point and I'd be more glad if you made a point about a solution to my question
2010-11-25T06:43:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	you can always create a root account or run gksudo nautilus
2010-11-25T06:44:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	on one hand you say that it ask for my passwords for a reason, yet on the other hand you suggest such a 'solution'. please, make up your mind
2010-11-25T06:45:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	create a root account and use su
2010-11-25T06:45:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	that's not a solution
2010-11-25T06:45:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	be more specific then
2010-11-25T06:46:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	I want to permanently auhtenticate a specific action
2010-11-25T06:52:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	if you edit the sudoers file and ALL = NOPASSWD /path/to/binary for your user should work
2010-11-25T06:52:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	please stop giving the 'solutions', of which implications you obviously have no idea.
2010-11-25T06:56:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	try it and see
2010-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	will you please stop? I do know what this does. and this is not what i want.
2010-11-25T06:57:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	ok but me more clear what your asking then
2010-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	I've already told you
2010-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	I want to permanently auhtenticate a specific action
2010-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	and the specific action is?
2010-11-25T06:59:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	'action' as in 'policykit action'
2010-11-25T07:08:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	why you cant do %admin ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown Ive no idea
2010-11-25T07:09:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	because this app could do many more things of which I want to allow it to do only one. are you satisfied now?
2010-11-25T07:10:00.000Z	r007	janisozaur	ahh so its an app and not the user executing the command
2010-11-25T07:11:00.000Z	janisozaur	r007	and please, don't just go around and flap your gums about things you don't know. at least make sure you know implications of your solutions.
