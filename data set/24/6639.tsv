2006-01-10T16:43:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 for the looks thing, make it look like linux, and unlearn your dark side ways ;)
2006-01-10T16:45:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 if you install ubuntu, you are secure
2006-01-10T16:46:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 forget everytinhg you know about windows computing and start with a fresh slate in a brave new world ;)
2006-01-10T16:48:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 ubuntu linux is closed up tight by default. be scared if you then go and open all the windows in your new house
2006-01-10T16:49:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 all commercial games (or almost) are windows only.
2006-01-10T16:50:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 or keep a windows partition just for gaming if it matters that much to you.
2006-01-10T16:50:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 or until the time where you know enough in linux to get them to work.
2006-01-10T16:53:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 linux cant write to ntfs
2006-01-10T17:05:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 most games can be done that way, not all...    life forces us to choose sometimes.
2006-01-10T17:07:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 but for now, i suggest you install ubuntu and familiarise yourself with it. forget gaming for a while, boot to windows for that.      - and there arent any haxors here,, or at least they dont show off in here as such;
2006-01-10T17:10:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 not same processor, so not compiled same.
2006-01-10T17:10:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 same, but different...
2006-01-10T17:12:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 quit it with the games for now, install your ubuntu and learn to use it.
2006-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	Ber	 they could buy a PS2 in that case ;)
