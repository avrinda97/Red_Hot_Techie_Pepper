2007-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Thank you very much.
2007-11-04T13:53:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	please wait longer say 15 mins and that is more of a #ubuntu-doc question they document items
2007-11-04T13:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Please wait longer than 15 minutes before playing policeman.
2007-11-28T01:30:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	give me 5 mins to research that - at first glance it is kinda most sensible for it to occur when it does - I'll poke some resources
2007-11-28T01:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	I will patiently stand by.
2007-11-28T01:32:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	yeah it does make most sense: getty - a program which displays the login: prompt when logging into a Unix system.
2007-11-28T01:32:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	system is not in a "ready" state until they fire up
2007-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	What information should I read? Can you elaborate?
2007-12-15T19:51:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	all of it
2007-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Your answer is not helpful. I have put here a specific question. You are hinting at general reflections.
2007-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	the parts that tell you how to install codecs - so I guess you should ready the first one first and second one after that if you want more information and third one after that if you want even more info
2008-03-01T18:45:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	in the source for the kernel and the kernel newbies mailing list archive - it is all good stuff
2008-03-01T18:48:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	you need to attack google with a definitions /proc/meminfo http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs can help some, be aware there is some speculation that tells you that some of what you read is not what it appears to be documented at
2008-03-01T19:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	I have found the definitions asked for in my kernel sources. Thank you very much. --  But I do not understand your remark: "- it is all good stuff." Can you please say it other words so that I can comprehend what you mean.
2008-03-01T19:03:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	it is good to read and know these things
2008-03-01T19:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Ah, now I understand your remark in the given context. --  Thank you very much again.
2008-03-21T11:24:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	top: log out lock screen switch user bottom: suspend hibernate restart shutdown
2008-03-21T11:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Is 'shutdown' written as a single word, or is it there written 'Shut Down'?
2008-03-21T11:26:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	2
2008-03-21T11:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	ompaul	Thank you very much for your help and have a happy Easter.
2008-03-21T11:27:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	I am already
2008-10-05T13:50:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	perhaps this would be a better place to find such info or the kernel newbies list http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/6/3/139
2008-10-05T19:16:00.000Z	ompaul	bullgard4	what was that about?
