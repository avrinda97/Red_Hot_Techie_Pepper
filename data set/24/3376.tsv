2008-02-10T09:41:00.000Z	Ashnal		so ive found something that annoys me, which is that if im playing music of some sort, and my computer comes under a heavy processing load, the music will skip, is there a way to prevent this?
2008-02-10T09:42:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	only if you up the nice level of the other stuff you are doing, I think.
2008-02-10T09:44:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	actually try running the music player from the command line preceeded by nice 0 or so.   "man nice" for how to use nice
2008-02-10T11:38:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	ok do this find /etc -type f -name "dosbox.conf" -print
2008-02-10T11:38:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	I think that should find it if it is in the /etc directory
2008-02-10T11:39:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	i get zilc
2008-02-10T11:40:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	Ok, I'm thinking that there isn't one there then heh
2008-02-10T11:40:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	did you install from Synaptic or apt or some such?
2008-02-10T11:40:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	i installed using the add/remove feature
2008-02-10T11:41:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	ok good... give me a minute and I'll see if i remember how to do something
2008-02-10T11:45:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	I *think* that dpkg -S dosbox.conf should work
2008-02-10T11:45:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	whatll that do? tell me where dosbox.conf is?
2008-02-10T11:46:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	I don't have dosbox.  That will tell dpkg to search for the packages that have dosbox.conf  so should tell you where it installed it
2008-02-10T11:47:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	so will this dpkg tell me where any app is installed?
2008-02-10T11:47:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	it will tell you where a particular file is, if you installed it the normal way
2008-02-10T11:52:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	im with you, and i currently have no idea where to put this config file so that dosbox will load it at startup
2008-02-10T11:53:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	See, it is all about finding something, and editing it... it should not be about finding something, figure out where to put it and then figure out how the hell to get it to work at all
2008-02-10T12:06:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	you have to compile DOS source code?
2008-02-10T12:06:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	YES
2008-02-10T12:07:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	i need to compile DOS source into a DOS executable to be run in DOSbox
2008-02-10T12:07:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	what the hell... I don't think I ever thought that would be something anyone would ever need to do... Compile DOS source so can run a DOS emulator to run on Linux
2008-02-10T12:08:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	If you had a compiler... maybe...
2008-02-10T12:08:00.000Z	Ashnal	cptnapalm	i have the compiler
2008-02-10T12:09:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Ashnal	so have to run a DOS compiler under an emulator on linux to compile DOS code on Linux so can run a DOS emulator to run a game on Linux
