2007-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	thats what I'm doing, just a sec
2007-07-27T06:07:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	here is the output as I did /dev/urandom > /dev/sdc
2007-07-27T06:07:00.000Z	Olgem		http://pastebin.com/m283aee18
2007-07-27T06:08:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	did you 'umount /dev/sdc1' before 'cat /dev/urandom > /dev/sdc'?
2007-07-27T06:09:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	it was never mounted in the first place
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	there's something very strange going on here. if i'm reading this correctly, the stick isn't getting a node at all any longer.
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	also when it appears in /dev/ it is usually just sdc rather than having any sdc1/sdc2
2007-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	that means that the linux kernel hasn't recognised a partition on the stick
2007-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	maybe its a bad USB stick?
2007-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	Olgem		I did fsck a couple times to no avail
2007-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	if you have another usb stick, try that. the linux usb subsystem is actually pretty good, so we're probably looking at a hardware problem here (or maybe something on your mainboard that doesn't support linux)
2007-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	Olgem		I'm going to run memtest86 and look at my SMART readings later, I've been having problems with applications thinking the disk is full when it really isn't in debian
2007-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	I do have another USB stick thankfully, and that works spectacular
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	do you often use the computer with the case open?
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	no,
2007-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	Olgem	howlingmadhowi1	but I have opened it up quite a bit to install stuff, but that must have been at least 2 months ago
2007-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	okay. then it sounds unlikely that something overheated (i once fried a dvd-burner by installing ubuntu while the case was open. the internal fans had no way of knowing that things were getting hot, so they didn't switch on -as if it would have helped)
2007-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	Olgem		Note it has happened on another computer with fiesty also installed, but on windowsXP it _seemed_ to function well, but I can't confirm
2007-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	then it's more likely to be the usb-stick than the computer itself. maybe borrow a usbstick from a friend and see if that works in ubuntu
2007-07-27T06:16:00.000Z	Olgem		Sure, I have another I can use for now, would you might know how often people can get bad USB-Sticks? I thought they were like processors where you almost never get a bad one despite complexity
2007-07-27T06:16:00.000Z	Olgem		howlingmadhowi1**
2007-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	i really don't know. short of having one run over by a car, i've never had a problem with a usb-stick myself (although my sample space is restricted to two (2) usbsticks in total :) )
2007-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	Olgem		ah, well thanks anyway for the help howlingmadhowi1 :)
2007-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	Olgem	sorry i couldn't help more. :(
