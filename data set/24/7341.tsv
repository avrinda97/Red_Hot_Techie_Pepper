2005-02-06T08:31:00.000Z	hams		randbis, i had a .bz2 of the kernel source and a directory called linux-header-2.6.8.1-4 and linux-headers-2.6.8.1-4-amd64-k8\
2005-02-06T08:32:00.000Z	hams		ok... i'll take you're word for it.
2005-02-06T08:33:00.000Z	hams		ok, the nvidia install seems to detect the kernel source, but it doesn't like something, so i actually need to build the kernel?
2005-02-06T08:35:00.000Z	hams		how do i build the kernel the same options, that the warty-release is installed with?
2005-02-06T08:36:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	get the config* from /boot and copy it to the root dir of the kernel source
2005-02-06T08:36:00.000Z	hams	farruinn	as .config correct?
2005-02-06T10:14:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	I believe you only have to uncomment some lines in the config file, but I"m not sure what
2005-02-07T09:36:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	in warty it depends on python2.3
2005-02-13T09:58:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	perhaps you're completely up to date?
2005-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	it's in universe
2005-02-14T10:49:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	art.gnome.org I believe
2005-03-01T10:19:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	just s/warty/hoary in /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-03-01T10:20:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	/topic
2005-03-01T10:22:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	there is a link in the topic
2005-03-01T10:44:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	you'll probably have to 'modprobe hfsplus' before you can mount it
2005-03-01T10:45:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	or just 'sudo echo hfsplus >> /etc/modules'
2005-03-01T10:51:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	you might want to add a line to your /etc/fstab with the users option
2005-03-01T11:03:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	this hfs+ partition doesn't have OS X on it does it?
2005-03-01T11:05:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	what's happened to me is every file I touch in linux has its owner:group changed to numbers which has to be fixed if you want to use the partition with OS X
2005-03-01T11:09:00.000Z	hams	farruinn	ok it worked. is /etc/fstab only read at boot?
2005-03-01T11:10:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	there's an option used with mount I think that remounts stuff in fstab, but I don't remember what it is
2005-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	farruinn	hams	maybe in the initrd
2005-03-01T11:18:00.000Z	hams	farruinn	the initrd has a control file?
2005-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	hams	farruinn	is there a way to see what is in it?
