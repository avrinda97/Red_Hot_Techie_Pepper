2005-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	lee		after recompiling my kernel, when I plug in my firewire hd it not longer auto-mounts/brings up a list of files in the root, what do I need to do to restore this behaviour?
2005-08-09T07:12:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	use the standard kernel :)
2005-08-09T07:12:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	um, no =)  I can't use the latest nvidia drivers if I do that
2005-08-09T07:12:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	then live without automounts :)
2005-08-09T07:13:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	is it just a config option that I need to enable to accomplish that, the kernel automounter v3/v4?
2005-08-09T07:14:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	it's already fixed in hal
2005-08-09T07:15:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	is breezy the equivalent of debian's sid, ie can anything break at any time?
2005-08-09T07:15:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	all UBuntu versions are based on sid :)
2005-08-09T15:29:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	wow :)
2005-08-09T15:31:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	any suggestions wtf caused that?
2005-08-09T15:31:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	no clue at all
2005-08-09T15:32:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	nope
2005-08-09T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	then you will probably never know
2005-08-09T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	unles dmesg has something
2005-08-10T05:42:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	true :)
2005-08-10T05:44:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	HAL == hardware abstraction layer
2005-08-10T05:45:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	where is that controlled/what is it controlled by?
2005-08-10T05:45:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	I'm afraid I don't know the details, but it's a layer between kernel and system programs
2005-08-10T05:46:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	ok, let me rephrase, where is it, some package, or some config option in the kernel?
2005-08-10T05:47:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	also, do you realise this is a linux help channel?  you're not being anywhere near condescending enough ;)
2005-08-10T05:48:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	ehrm, english is not my native language. What's 'condescending'?
2005-08-10T05:49:00.000Z	lee	Seveas	are you familiar with #debian, specifically mwilson?  otherwise, read "rude and obnoxious" ;)
2005-08-10T05:49:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	check :)
2005-08-10T05:49:00.000Z	Seveas	lee	we like to keep this channel friendly, unlike #debian :)
