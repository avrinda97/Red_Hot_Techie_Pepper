2006-11-17T16:13:00.000Z	dromer		anybody some advice aon compiling gchempaint? I wish I could just apt-get it :(
2006-11-17T16:14:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	one tip, compile things with checkinstall. it tuns the finish product into a .deb and automatically installs it, makes it easier to manager (and remove)
2006-11-17T16:20:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	I just wish there was a usable ubuntu-package for gchempaint, it looks so damn good, just no way for me to use it :( (waaaay to many dependency's unable to meet)

2006-12-18T16:08:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	I'm on dapper
2006-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	it should be applications -> accessories -> search
2006-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	oh sorry, I'm in kde ..
2006-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	Search is in my list now
2006-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	well try it :)
2006-12-18T16:13:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	it fails :/

2006-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	i'm sorry i'm not up-to-date on kde stuff
2006-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	haha, no worries :)
2006-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	most of my kde experience is two years old
2007-01-30T16:15:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	use screen :P
2007-01-30T16:15:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	hehe, haven't mastered that yet :P
2007-01-30T16:17:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	I _am_ doing X-forwarding atm
2007-01-30T16:17:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	launch a tabbed x terminal and launch your apps from that :P
2007-01-30T16:18:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	good one !
2007-01-30T16:20:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	basically you can use bg and fg (background and foreground), and jobs and &
2007-01-30T16:20:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	you'll figure it out, just use bg to resume apps you paused with ctrl+z
2007-01-30T16:20:00.000Z	nothlit	dromer	ctrl+z + bg # is what you use if you forgot to use &
2007-01-30T16:21:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	I should really get to this test ;) ttyl
2007-02-02T16:32:00.000Z	dromer	nothlit	thnx, I got the file moved :)
