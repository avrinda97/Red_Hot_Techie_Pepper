2005-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	Arnia		I hate C and C++ personally
2005-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	Arnia		I don't like languages which force me to think outside my problem domain... hence why I like Nemerle and Python :)
2005-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	I like C++, and embedding maybe python ;)
2005-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	python sure does help on the fly
2005-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	I use python for quite large projects... I'd never consider using C or C++ for them because they'd irritate me so much I would be able to stomach maintenance
2005-04-15T09:24:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	Do you think everyone should code production systems in C or C++ then?
2005-04-15T09:24:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	only if they use a helper program and are smart enough to activate it
2005-04-15T09:25:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	I know I've made some pretty dumb coding errors, though any langauge you can make programming errors
2005-04-15T09:27:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	Yes, but I believe in using the right language for the right job and I like having my libraries come with me where possible. That is why I like the design of the CLI. I can write my description logic reasoner in a functional language like Nemerle, and glue it to a UI written in an OO language like C#. Much saner from my perspective, and avoids the whole problem of ABI compatibility and binding
2005-04-15T09:38:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	there is only a right language for the right job when it is decided what type of program it is. C++ is the best application langugage due to all the libraries and easiness. C# and the rest can just go run in the road. The only thing C++ can't be used for because it takes much too long is a couple types of numerical analysis, which in turn you need to use a powerful language like lisp or fortran ;)
2005-04-15T09:39:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	using Java, C#, or any of the fad languages because "its easier" is no excuse
2005-04-15T09:40:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	What does 'easier' mean to you?
2005-04-15T09:40:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	No, the question is, "What does easier mean to other people"
2005-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	from what I observed, people want the compiler to babysit them because they don't want to learn how to program properly
2005-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	this is in any CS class, just sit in and watch for a few sessions and ask the kids some questions
2005-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	No, you've criticised a particular point of view. You did it in a way that suggests that you have a particular view point yourself. I wish to know it.
2005-04-15T09:41:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	I've criticised over observations
2005-04-15T09:42:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	and the fact that the best GUI toolkit(wxwindows) is written in C++
2005-04-15T09:45:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	I'm not stupid, but I have far better things to do with my brain than pointer arithmetic and memory allocation. I'd prefer to spend my time thinking of matters of consequence in the problem domain I'm trying to address. 'Coding properly' to me means learning how to fix upon and express a domain model and its algorithms. What language you use to do this is up to you.
2005-04-15T09:45:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	you don't have to think about memory allocation
2005-04-15T09:46:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	So why is knowing C++ coding properly?
2005-04-15T09:46:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	I mean people who want to learn the fad langauges don't want to code properly
2005-04-15T09:47:00.000Z	dross	Arnia	they learn it because they are stupid and don't give a damn about future development of what they are making
2005-04-15T09:51:00.000Z	Arnia	dross	I didn't learn C# or Nemerle because they're new. Far from it. I learnt them because they addressed personal needs I'd wanted addressed for a long time. From a language theory point of view, the CLI is astonishingly well thought out. See Nemerle and how well such a language (a weird language by any standard) will work with it.
