2008-08-18T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	you can boot from a raid 1 device no issues
2008-08-18T01:07:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	mebbe i forgot my raid numbers.  my boot partition has needed to always be on a mirrored raid. i thought that was 0. it has a copy of my kernel on each of the drives.
2008-08-18T01:26:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 what about ti's cousin, "Someone" ??:)
2008-10-21T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	wht's the issue ?
2008-10-21T13:24:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 I'm installing a ubuntu to be a ltsp server, on an amd64 (64-bit is a given) but it has a nvidia 8800 in it, so I'm thinking of going desktop.  thoughts?
2008-10-21T13:24:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	well, if you want to support the graphics card I'd advise the desktop version unless you have more than say 16 gig ofr ram installed
2008-10-21T13:25:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	production box = 8.04 for LTS support and stability, no question
2008-10-21T13:34:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 touch and find is more likeely to be right..  been there,  never found the needle in that haystack.
2008-10-21T13:35:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	yes, touching a file is an easy example
2008-12-23T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	open hardware drivers from system->administration menu and disable it
2008-12-23T13:31:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 i can't get to the gui with the driver active.
2008-12-23T13:31:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 it's that severe of a problem
2008-12-23T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	put the line Driver "Vesa" in the /etx/X11/xorg.conf under the configured video card device
2008-12-23T13:32:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 vesa play ugly with this card too :-( my first fix also.
2008-12-23T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	yes but you use that driver to get the menyu back to disable the drivers you don't want
2008-12-23T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	I'm not telling you to use vesa as a solution, just to get the desktop back so you can access the drivers manager
2008-12-23T13:34:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	fglrx gives me a screen that looks blank(washed in white), and vesa gives me a screen that looks like scrambled eggs.
2008-12-23T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	ahhh it's an ati card
2008-12-23T13:35:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	this may sound harsh but ati cards a rea problem
2008-12-23T13:36:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	I'm a 10-year linux veteran.  i may like ati sometimes because they are now a part of my favorite cpu manuf., but i agree,   their closed-source drivers suck.
2008-12-23T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	sorry, that wasn't for you
2009-07-01T23:21:00.000Z	ikonia	kc8pxy	yes
2009-07-01T23:25:00.000Z	kc8pxy	ikonia	 i noticed that the animation is a RLE file  and my system recognized it as a run-length-encoded bitmap..  what is the best tool to make one of those?
