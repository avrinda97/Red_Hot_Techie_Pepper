2006-05-14T07:20:00.000Z	steveire		Hi.
2006-05-14T07:20:00.000Z	steveire		I've just installed education-mathematics
2006-05-14T07:21:00.000Z	steveire		There's no change to my system though. Do I need to install something else to use it?
2006-05-14T07:21:00.000Z	steveire		!education
2006-05-14T07:22:00.000Z	steveire		Is there a main package, or anything else that I need?
2006-05-14T07:23:00.000Z	steveire		What does it mean to say that a package is a metapackage?
2006-05-14T07:24:00.000Z	steveire		So what else do I need to use education-mathematics?
2006-05-14T07:24:00.000Z	steveire		I thought adept would get sll dependant packages automatically.

2006-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	usually, yes i do
2006-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	prevents you from losing your data when you have to format
2006-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	you can do it w/ the installer
2006-05-18T16:11:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	i also usually use a separate DISK
2006-05-18T16:12:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	yes, during the install, you simply do a manual partitioning
2006-05-18T16:13:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	as long as you mount it at /boot
2006-05-18T16:13:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	yes, that's where the kernels are kept
2006-05-18T16:15:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	the reason they do that is in case there is a messup and the new kernel doesn't boot.
2006-05-18T16:21:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	the grub files are in /boot, but it installs to the MBR to boot
2006-05-18T16:23:00.000Z	steveire	paradizelost	What do you mean it installs the MBR to boot? It installs the MBR to whichever disto I use to install it?
2006-05-18T16:59:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	ext3 is fine, but i usually prefer reiserfs
2006-05-18T05:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	do you still want to boot to windows at all?
2006-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	then i'd leave it as is
2006-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	paradizelost	steveire	if the system is booing now, i'd leave it alone
