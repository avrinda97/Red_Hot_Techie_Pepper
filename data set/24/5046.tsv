2007-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	it's not a bug, just addressing simple security
2007-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	What is the issue exactly ( I missed it )?
2007-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	I would say that that is something for a Bug report, misconfiguration / insecure default setups are a Bug, then you can get an answer from the actual Ubuntu devs
2007-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	which channel?
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	#ubuntu-devel, but I meant that you should file an actual bug report
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	ok thanks
2007-04-19T09:20:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	Are they planing on a front end to xorg so resolutions can be configured?
2007-04-19T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	I have never seen any person who has had resolution problems with their xorg.conf , it is _always_ a driver problem
2007-04-19T09:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	And Upstream Xorg is making it so that in the next release you won't need an xorg.conf at all
2007-04-19T09:22:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	I had to edit the xorg.conf for my resolution and refresh
2007-04-19T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	What card
2007-04-19T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	I have never tried an ASUS card
2007-04-19T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	I have helped here a lot and in the past year not one person with a resolution problem has not had it fixed by installing the correct drivers
2007-04-19T09:25:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	it's the monitor, I even sent it in the hardware report to ubuntu devs and the hardware device ID, (which they seem to have fixed)
2007-04-19T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	ahh
2007-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	Xorg is not going to detect my monitor refresh, the deafult one is useless 60Hz, I had to add my proper V/H refresh
2007-04-19T09:29:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	Xorg dont have hotplug yet, they supposed to have it in xorg 7.3, is ubuntu waiting for that instead?
2007-04-19T09:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	Basically, they were going to add a GUI config for Feisty until Xorg made their announcement
2007-04-19T09:32:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	ok nice, the restricted driver manager is a great addition
2007-04-19T09:50:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	my bug report is done and sent
2007-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Half-Left	Could you give me a link? I am interested in the response.
2007-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/107616
2007-04-19T09:57:00.000Z	Half-Left	Jordan_U	 buy the way iptables in Linux is pretty poor compared to BSD, I know Ubuntu is not responsible for that but but having things as they are makes it worse. Sorry to go on but it's a important subject
