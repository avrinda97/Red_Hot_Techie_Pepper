2007-04-16T09:25:00.000Z	ikonia_		Does anyone have a guide, or even better experience in sharing a printer with cups without any gui tools
2007-04-16T09:26:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	google?
2007-04-16T09:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	pathetic
2007-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	from command line in other words, right?
2007-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	yes, there was a thread on the ubuntu forums but that appears to have been archived
2007-04-16T09:27:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	did you know that cups has a web based interface?
2007-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	I am aware of it, but I'm not sure I'll be able to configure it due to the network configuration I'm running at the moment
2007-04-16T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia_		I think I may have found the thread.
2007-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	http://localhost:631
2007-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	I'm not on the local host - as I said I don't think it will work on my network setup
2007-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	if cups is runing, then the web based interface should be as well, since it's usually built in.
2007-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	anyways, the google results are in: http://www.novell.com/documentation/suse91/suselinux-adminguide/html/ch05s07.html
2007-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	- I'll say it again, due to the network configuration I don't think that will work at this moment in time. I'll have to go about reconfiguring the network/server to allow that
2007-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	suse linux works differently for the setup.
2007-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	yes, but you don't know if it will work until you've tried, right?
2007-04-16T09:30:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	not /that/ different
2007-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	tell you what, please don't comment on this topic any more. Thanks for you time. I've said 3 times it won't work
2007-04-16T09:32:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	it's worked for me for ubuntu, slackware, debian, freespire, knoppix, slax, redhat, suse, gentoo...
2007-04-16T09:33:00.000Z	clarjon1		don't say it doesn't work till you've at least tried it and have the error message.
2007-04-16T09:34:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	please drop it, I know it doesn't work
2007-04-16T09:35:00.000Z	clarjon1	ikonia_	The concepts are the same, from distro to distro.  The only differences is most likely where the files are stored, and a simple locate/slocate/find can help you out there.
2007-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	one final time. Please stop discussing this topic with me. While I appriciate your help/input, your not listening to me that dues to my configuration I can't use the tools your suggesting
2007-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	clarjon1		You can't even use the tools that come with the cups packages?
2007-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	ikonia_	clarjon1	not the web based tools. I have a how to that will allow me to configure cups from the command line, and I'm working through that
