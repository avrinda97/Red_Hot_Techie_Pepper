2010-06-23T01:48:00.000Z	DrGrov		How can I enable real time transparency in 10.04? Windows and the whole thing
2010-06-23T01:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	uhmm
2010-06-23T01:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	there was going to be a transparant feature, but thats been delayed untill 10.10
2010-06-23T01:49:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	my specs will handle it perfectly. damn it
2010-06-23T01:49:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	so i need to wait until 10.10 to get some real time transparency? not cool, not cool at all
2010-06-23T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	you mean the RGB or whatever it was called thing yeah?
2010-06-23T01:50:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	yes, something like that. i want real god damn transparency without any pseudo transparency. my specs can handle it.
2010-06-23T01:50:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	but not a problem, will wait for 10.10 then :)
2010-06-23T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	yeah except
2010-06-23T01:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	whatever 10.10 has for this will probably be quite basic
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	needed to remind me of a "g... dam..." ? lol
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	 anyway in the mean time, you can make your panels transparant
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	yes, that is good idea. panels as transparent will be useful.
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	and with the default theme, the terminal has a transparant effect as well
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	i set the transparency on the terminal already.
2010-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	if you make the panels big,  with transparant effect, that can be fun, since then you can see through to the background
2010-06-23T01:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	and you can put one on the left and right even  just for this, but auto hide, or they take up way to much space
2010-06-23T01:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	and Compiz has transparant effects I think
2010-06-23T01:53:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	sure, i can try that out. it seems like the transparency is rather good but icons really need to be bigger.
2010-06-23T01:54:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	compiz was actually quite good as well. did not find though the transparency settings i was looking for though.
2010-06-23T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	I don't tend to use Compiz, but I think it can do it
2010-06-23T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DrGrov	may need the advanced settings manager
2010-06-23T01:55:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	i think my specs would be able to handle full transparency all the way around. not sure too
2010-06-23T01:55:00.000Z	DrGrov	sebsebseb	thanks for your kind help :)
