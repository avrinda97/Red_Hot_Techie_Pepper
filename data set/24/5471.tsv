2007-01-28T17:40:00.000Z	deitarion		I prefer rTorrent because it's console based so I can run it inside screen.
2007-01-28T17:40:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	does it have encryption yet?
2007-01-28T17:40:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	I think it might have been added in the newest release, but I'm not sure.
2007-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	no encryption means it's useless crap for me
2007-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	I've never needed encryption,so I never checked.
2007-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	it's called manual partitioning and works nice
2007-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	What I've been asking is how the heck does the manual partitioner work. My friend can't figure it out and the screenshots seem to indicate a design that isn't as manual as it should be.
2007-01-28T17:52:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	I could, but then, I'm a geek, and I also knew better and check if it _really_ isn't going to format my existing partitions, which it didn't support (hi again, Reiser4)
2007-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	I'm a geek too, I just don't have much luck working from screeshots of a machine thousands of kilometres away.
2007-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	do you have the screenshots somewhere handy?
2007-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	http://img297.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot1wo8.png
2007-01-28T17:53:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	That's where we're stuck.
2007-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	it should be possible to ssh into a ubuntu installer :)
2007-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	I'll ask him.
2007-01-28T17:54:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	ask him to go into System -> Preferences -> Desktop Sharing
2007-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	if you can access his machine from outside, it should do the trick
2007-01-28T17:55:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	What protocol does that use? I'm on Gentoo.
2007-01-28T17:56:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	umm, VNC
2007-01-28T17:56:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	Ahh, no problem then. I've got vncviewer installed.
2007-01-28T17:56:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	install xvncviever4
2007-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	still, it's pretty sick you can IM from an installer :)
2007-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	He says he doesn't have Desktop Sharing.
2007-01-28T17:58:00.000Z	mathrick	deitarion	what about Remote Desktop or somesuch? I'm translating back from Danish, so my names might not be entirely accurate
2007-01-28T06:09:00.000Z	deitarion	mathrick	We figured it out, but it's now saying "No root filesystem" even though we set one.
