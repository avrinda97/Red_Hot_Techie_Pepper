2008-04-07T17:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	type sudo in front of the command
2008-04-07T17:02:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	it tells me the timestamp is too far in the future
2008-04-07T17:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	are you trying that new time-travel package?
2008-04-07T17:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	not sure about the timestamp error
2008-04-07T17:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	" <Pici> IdleOne: It means that something is wrong with the system clock.  Sometimes sudo -k and/or sudo -K can fix it, or correcting the time in the BIOS. "

2008-04-07T17:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	try running sudo -k as Pici suggested
2008-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	do you have synaptic package manager open?
2008-04-07T17:09:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	same timestamp time travel error when i try sudo -k and sudo -K
2008-04-07T17:10:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	not that i'm aware of, i've just set up ubuntu and didn't install anything exept xChat
2008-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	ok seems you have some other package manager running. figure out what they are and close them out then try running your command again with sudo
2008-04-07T17:14:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	I happen to have no idea of what a package manager is. Where should i check ?
2008-04-07T17:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	have you tried any other way to install amsn besides using the command line?
2008-04-07T17:18:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	is there any other way to do it ?
2008-04-07T17:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	we can delete that file so apt-get can try again sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2008-04-07T17:20:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	right, how do i do that ?
2008-04-07T17:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2008-04-07T17:21:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	i did it, and then tryed to install the build essentials again. It prompted the installation but cancelled with the same error message.
2008-04-07T17:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	your pastebin shows you trying to install amsn. why you trying build-essential now?
2008-04-07T17:23:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	i've just been advised to do that first
2008-04-07T17:23:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	anyway, amsn or build essentials, the error message is the same
2008-04-07T17:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	you wont be able to install anything until you unlock the lockfile
2008-04-07T17:24:00.000Z	clee-saan	IdleOne	there is no output, it just displays a new commandline
2008-04-07T17:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	clee-saan	ok
