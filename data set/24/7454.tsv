2005-05-27T09:09:00.000Z	johnnybezak		i've read the network admin guide over at tldp.org but it just goes in one ear and out the other
2005-05-27T09:09:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	much to read you have, young padawan. :-)
2005-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	lol
2005-05-27T09:13:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	you don't have to though
2005-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	of course, but I find that usually it is best to go with the grain of how things are meant to work...
2005-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	yeah but that single click thing sure is annoying haha
2005-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	as is spatial nautilus mac os 9 is dead hehe
2005-05-27T09:15:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	admittedly I found the single click rather annoying to at first.
2005-05-27T09:15:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	then I discovered how to select without opening things :-)
2005-05-27T09:18:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	it is not so much a reason, because either way is good.
2005-05-27T09:18:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	but that usually something like ''single click'' implies a number of other design details that then dont fit well with a different choice, even if it is possible.
2005-05-27T09:19:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	yeah i understand
2005-05-27T09:21:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	there are a few others like that -- Wesnoth is a freeware equivalent...
2005-05-27T09:22:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	you use kde?
2005-05-27T09:24:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	yes...
2005-05-27T09:24:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	cool, do you use gnome too or just kde
2005-05-27T09:26:00.000Z	Blissex	johnnybezak	I used first just TWM/VTWM as a window manager, then FVWM and FVWM2 for about ten years, with a bit of KDE, and then now I have switched to almost only KDE.
2005-05-27T09:26:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Blissex	oh yeah i used to be a big kde fan, but i like gnome atm. the only thing i dont like is the ugly icons
