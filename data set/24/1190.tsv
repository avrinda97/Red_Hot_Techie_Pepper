2010-06-05T03:59:00.000Z	orangeglo		ls: gave me all of my downloads, and octosetup-linux_i386.bin is there too, and octoshape
2010-06-05T03:59:00.000Z	orangeglo		appl6: wow im dumb, i didnt see the octoshape file in my downloads... so how am i able to now paste in the command to that file?
2010-06-05T04:00:00.000Z	orangeglo		appl6: i guess my question is, how can i execute a command at a file?
2010-06-05T04:00:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	exactly what are you trying to do?
2010-06-05T04:01:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	Bring up a terminal and do as instructions said:  ./OctoshapeClient -url:octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel
2010-06-05T04:02:00.000Z	orangeglo	usr13	i have, but it tells me that the file doesnt exist
2010-06-05T04:02:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	./OctoshapeClient -url:octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel #Where -url:octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel is the actual URL.
2010-06-05T04:03:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	Did you cd to the directory where OctoshapeClient actually resides?
2010-06-05T04:03:00.000Z	orangeglo	usr13	yes, i am currently in my downloads file
2010-06-05T04:03:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	ls  #Will give you a list of files in the current directory
2010-06-05T04:04:00.000Z	orangeglo	usr13	the file is in my downloads folder, i just ls'd but when i enter the command it says no such file or directory
2010-06-05T04:05:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	Bring up a terminal and do as instructions said:  ./OctoshapeClient -url:octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel #Where OctoshapeClient is the actual name of the executable / bin file and where octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel is the correct target URL.
2010-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	ls  #And then look at the list.
2010-06-05T04:06:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	pastebin the output of   ls
2010-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	orangeglo	usr13	ive tried that. i entered the EXACT file name, but it still says no such file or directory
2010-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	Did you run ./octosetup-linux_i386.bin and follow the installation instructions?
2010-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	Did you run ./octosetup-linux_i386.bin and follow the installation instructions?
2010-06-05T04:12:00.000Z	usr13	orangeglo	very good
