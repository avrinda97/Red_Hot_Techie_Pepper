2005-12-07T07:46:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	well... Im a good argurer... or however you spell that, anyway, I am very interested in it
2005-12-07T07:48:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	dont start partying, im only 18 and im already tired of it, waste of money and waste of good health
2005-12-07T07:49:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	okay
2005-12-07T07:50:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	that sounds exactly right, like in math i can figure out short cuts to make it easier
2005-12-07T07:51:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	that sounds good, I think I like that
2005-12-07T07:52:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	it will help in life, you can logically see why someone did that they did to make something happen or build something
2005-12-07T07:53:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	is that why i am good at puzzles?
2005-12-07T07:55:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	oh, i see, it takes logic to build one, I know than (as Red-Sox builds a computer)
2005-12-07T08:03:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	coming from someone who had a 4.0gpa and high state/act scores yet by my junior year in HS fell to a 2.6gpa and rankked in the 75% of my class, do your homework no matter how easy and bogus it is, even if you can teach the class and argue the teacher out of his or her job
2005-12-07T08:04:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	yes, i do, though i dont have a 4.0 gpa accumulated over the years, 3.8
2005-12-07T08:04:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	i have gotten two B's i believe
2005-12-07T08:05:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	im talking about later grade school is bogus and they will tell you that, HighSchool is all that matters
2005-12-07T08:05:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	oh, i see, right now i am preparing for high school, right?
2005-12-07T08:06:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	yea if your HS offers Honor classes look into it
2005-12-07T08:06:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	my HS didnt and i got bored quickly with the bullcrap they where teaching
2005-12-07T08:06:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	i am already taking High School credits, and next year i will take honors
2005-12-07T08:07:00.000Z	guru54_	Red-Sox	nice im actually taking college classes for my senior year lol HS ran out of classes for me and i tested out of state ones
2005-12-07T08:08:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	cool, the middle school is letting me go ahead in the classes that I am real good at, and they let me take classes with the 8th grade HS credit guys
2005-12-07T08:12:00.000Z	Red-Sox	guru54_	is it a real channel?
