2012-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	hoijui		i am using ubuntu (XFCE) on netbook with the typically small screen (1024x600), and evolution is just unusable here
2012-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	hoijui		why is it the default email client?
2012-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	hoijui		practically every dialog is too large in height
2012-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	hoijui		and there are no scrollbars
2012-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	hoijui		it is only soso usable using Alt+dragging
2012-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	AlanBell	hoijui	that is a longstanding bug, bug 8629 and various re-reports of it
2012-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	AlanBell	hoijui	the default email client is now thunderbird
2012-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	hoijui		ahh k :D nice, and thanks
2012-02-19T17:20:00.000Z	hoijui		will use thunderbird too then
2012-02-19T17:20:00.000Z	AlanBell	hoijui	it is actually probably quite easy to fix, I looked into it ages and ages ago, there is a wizard class somewhere that has a fixed height and it throws everything out and doesn't rescale and grow scrollbars.
2012-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	hoijui		mmm ok :-)
2012-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	hoijui		they lazy?
2012-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	AlanBell		no, they just have bigger screens than you :)
2012-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	hoijui		i mean.. netbook users are.. many, these days
2012-02-19T17:22:00.000Z	AlanBell		anyone can fix it, if motivated to do so
2012-02-19T17:22:00.000Z	hoijui		an email client just cant afford to ignore that
2012-02-19T17:22:00.000Z	hoijui		yeah.. ;-)
2012-02-19T17:23:00.000Z	hoijui		if it would be java, i'd do it
2012-02-19T17:23:00.000Z	AlanBell		there are a bunch of patches to make it fit, and a lot of the dialogs do now fit, take a screenshot of the one that doesn't and file a bug about it
2012-02-19T17:24:00.000Z	AlanBell		see comment #32 onwards for my thoughts on the matter in 2009 :)
2012-02-19T17:24:00.000Z	hoijui		i just updated my ubuntu, and the main config dialog and the add-account dialogs fail
2012-02-19T17:25:00.000Z	hoijui		so i guess the patches are not yet released
2012-02-19T17:29:00.000Z	AlanBell	hoijui	yeah, years ago, dunno if they have fallen out or some other dialogs have grown too big, but on an actuall 1024x600 screen most of it should fit
2012-02-19T17:31:00.000Z	hoijui	AlanBell	ok... strange :/ it does not, here.
