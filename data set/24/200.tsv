2012-03-15T21:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	try:  sudo updatedb; locate something
2012-04-10T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	could try pressing ALT+F2 and run:  xkill
2012-05-30T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	if you close software centre and run:  gksudo software-center    does it work ok?

2012-08-12T06:29:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionParsnip	with lubuntu, during the install, it is already failing to connect to the router. :/
2012-08-12T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	its the same OS as Ubuntu, just a different DE/WM thats all
2012-08-12T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	so if you had that with Ubuntu, it will be the same in Lubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu
2012-08-12T06:31:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionParsnip	ouch....

2012-08-14T21:24:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionParsnip	thanks, ill uninstall it now, i dont een use it anymore
2012-08-14T21:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	you are free to use it but it was removed from the repos for a reason
2012-08-14T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	sounds like your apt fromtend crashed and hasn't freed the packages
2012-08-14T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	that will free them up. I assume you don't have software centre open etc
2012-08-14T21:27:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionParsnip	how do i drop m y permissions?
2012-08-14T21:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AcidRain2012	the command ubottu gave will help
