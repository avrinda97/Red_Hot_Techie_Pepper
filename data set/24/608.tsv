2011-05-04T16:04:00.000Z	trap22		How can I update my exiting RythmBox to next stable version using terminal ?
2011-05-04T16:06:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	if you're lucky, you can find one in PPA. rhythmbox has lots of gnome dependencies if I'm not mistaken
2011-05-04T16:07:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	bazhang: which player do you guys use ?
2011-05-04T16:08:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	i'm not the music-listener type, but right now I have rhythmbox installed with my Unity-based 11.04
2011-05-04T16:09:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	I remember using Audacious when I was in Jackalope
2011-05-04T16:11:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	bazhang: syockit weird, you don't listen to music. anyways i'm downloading this .tar.gz of rythembox 0.13, i need to overwrite the existing one.
2011-05-04T16:13:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	not a directory?
2011-05-04T16:14:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	yes, not a directory, just a executable file
2011-05-04T16:14:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	what does it output in terminal? maybe it segfaulted
2011-05-04T16:15:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	 cannot execute binary file
2011-05-04T16:17:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	yay it happily runs on my 32-bit! Yeehaw!
2011-05-04T16:18:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	might be corrupted download. redownload, it's small, worth the try
2011-05-04T16:27:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	XMMS2 is actually a player daemon/server, which needs a client to interface with, and has loads of installable plugins for you to play with, for the best hellish customization
2011-05-04T16:31:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	if you're lucky, you might get the plugins you want for audacious. I don't know just what "audacious-plugins" package provides. It lists many audio output, and at the end has this "And many more!" line that makes me wonder. It may or may not contain the "31-band EQ"
2011-05-04T16:32:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	ok, i will install audacious'
2011-05-04T16:36:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	yes, i am searching
2011-05-04T16:38:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/472985
2011-05-04T16:43:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	it seems that upstream has it fixed. The patch is somewhere in https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166020 . You may request someone with technical debian knowledge to try apply patch to glib package
2011-05-04T16:45:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	huh!!
2011-05-04T16:46:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	yup, that difficult to get things fixed. maybe I can try, I need to set up my build service first. It's been a long time since fixing debian packages
2011-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	btw by tracing the bug reports, the problem seems to reside in glib
2011-05-04T16:53:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	yes, i should see the glib updaets
2011-05-04T16:53:00.000Z	syockit	trap22	have you enabled the backports repo?
2011-05-04T16:53:00.000Z	trap22	syockit	no
