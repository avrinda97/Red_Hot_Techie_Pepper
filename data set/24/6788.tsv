2006-06-04T16:39:00.000Z	LasseL		I installed dapper and easy ubuntu but I still can't see dvd menues
2006-06-04T16:40:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	have you got package "libdvdnav4" installed?
2006-06-04T16:42:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	no, I'll try that
2006-06-04T16:44:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	I installed libdvdnav4 and I still can't see dvd menues
2006-06-04T16:44:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	what media player are you using?
2006-06-04T16:45:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	totem (gstreamer) as configured by default + easy ubuntu
2006-06-04T16:45:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	and which ubuntu version?
2006-06-04T16:45:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	6.06
2006-06-04T16:49:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	i have the following installed which work fine: libdvdnav4 libdvdplay0. if that does not do it for you, see if you have missed some gstreamer0.10 plugins (note: i'm using totem-xine instead of totem-gstreamer)
2006-06-04T16:54:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	that still didn't do it for me. I also tried totem with the xine backend, but that gives me another problem. It tells me that the audio device is already in use
2006-06-04T16:55:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	if you are trying to play a commercial dvd, do you have libdvdcss2 installed?
2006-06-04T16:55:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	yes, easyubuntu does that for me
2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	i forgot this one, do you have libdvdread3 installed?
2006-06-04T16:58:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	yes, that too. I can play the dvd from totem, but I can't get to the menu, enable subtitles or navigate in the playback
2006-06-04T05:00:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	have you tried with another dvd (shouldn't make a difference but you never know) and do you have all the gstreamer0.10 plugins, even the "bad" ones?
2006-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	bad = ugly
2006-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	the base plugins together with libdvdread, libdvdnav and decss2 should be enough though
2006-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	easyubuntu installs nearly all the gstreamer plugins. I am pretty sure I have them all. It works for me in gxine now. I had to killall esd && esd & to get rid of the sound problem
2006-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	nice. so it's only totem that still doesn't work?
2006-06-04T05:06:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	yeah, it must be gstreamer that sucks. Pretty annoying to have to restart esd every time I want to watch a movie though
2006-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	esd is not as good either. i disabled it and use alsa all the way instead. had esd probs as well on this hardware.
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	LasseL	Jowi	ok :( I pretty much reinstalled my old trusty warty upgrade b/c I thought that my sound problems would be solved with dapper
2006-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	Jowi	LasseL	esd work fine in general. but personally i hate it (sorry to all ubuntu esd coders out there).
