2008-07-01T17:15:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Ask a question first.
2008-07-01T17:16:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Are you just trying to enable syntax hilighting in vim?
2008-07-01T17:17:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Can you try installing the vim-full package first and see if that resolves your issue?
2008-07-01T17:22:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	please use a pastebin
2008-11-07T00:10:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	#awn may be of more help :)

2009-10-17T05:19:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	build-dep isn't a program. Are you trying to install or see a package's build-dependencies?
2009-10-17T05:20:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	'Yes' wasn't a valid answer to the question I wasked.
2011-06-22T17:33:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	For perl? build-dep installs all of the dependencies needed to compile the gtk2 package from source.
2011-06-22T17:35:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Firstly, 'gtk2' isn't a valid package name. Secondly, that doesn't have anything to do with perl,
2011-06-22T17:35:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	What are you actually trying to do?
2011-06-22T17:37:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	libgtk2-perl is in the repositires.
2011-06-22T17:38:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Then if you want the build dependencies for that package do: sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk2-perl
2011-07-06T18:26:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	What are you asking?
2011-08-01T22:54:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	^
2011-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Did you try the link I suggested?
2011-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas
2011-08-01T23:11:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Look for or report a bug firstly, you might find your fix right there.
2011-08-01T23:16:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Calm down, we've been trying to provide help.
2011-08-01T23:17:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	If you want to use jde, it looks like you're going to have some issues as it appears that the packages in Ubuntu do not install properly now that we use emacs23, take a look at the bugs here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jde
2011-08-01T23:17:00.000Z	Pici	perlsyntax	Perhaps they've been updated upstream to fix this.
