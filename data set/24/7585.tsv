2004-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	subterrific		OS X is a ram eating monster
2004-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	subterrific		ti4200 is good if you can find one
2004-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	subterrific		about $65 for mine, 6 months ago, and it runs doom3

2004-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	subterrific		and its playable
2004-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	bolivar	subterrific	did you get the apple care warranty? did you ever use it overseas?
2004-09-30T10:52:00.000Z	subterrific	bolivar	i did not get apple care because it was a company bought laptop and i never used it overseas, but i would definitely recommend getting apple care
2004-09-30T10:52:00.000Z	bolivar		warehajime: i would check the most recent tomshardware mass video card review and see what performs better and check the price
2004-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	subterrific		ibook have a bad reputation for breaking
2004-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	subterrific		everyone i know has had to send theirs back to apple for repairs
2004-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	bolivar		oh thats bad then
2004-09-30T10:53:00.000Z	bolivar		warehajime: no problem.  thats what i do anyway.  i hope that helps
2004-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	subterrific	bolivar	well they're great when you get a good one, but there seem to have been a lot of lemons
2004-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	subterrific		bad battery problems, bad logic boards are the two major ones i remember
2004-09-30T10:55:00.000Z	subterrific		well yeah, they fix it, but you have to send them your laptop
2004-09-30T10:55:00.000Z	subterrific		we went through 6 tibooks at our company too
2004-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	bolivar		but are they still more reliable than say dell, compaq, gateway?
2004-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	subterrific		i've been a mac user since 87, and i finally got fed up with apple because of their laptops. it sucks too because they have probably the best laptops
2004-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	subterrific	bolivar	IBM and Apple make the best laptops
2004-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	subterrific		i wouldn't even consider any other company
2004-09-30T10:57:00.000Z	bolivar		i actually did laptop hardware support for ibm...i like them
2004-09-30T10:57:00.000Z	subterrific	bolivar	yeah, my next laptop is going to be an IBM
