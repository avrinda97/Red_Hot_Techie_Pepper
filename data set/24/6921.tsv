2006-11-04T06:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	nocturn	paste the output of ifconfig -a in a pastebin
2006-11-04T06:55:00.000Z	erUSUL		!paste | nocturn

2006-11-04T06:57:00.000Z	nocturn		I think it got renamed to eth1

2006-11-04T06:57:00.000Z	nocturn		server has no network
2006-11-04T06:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	nocturn	just change the conf in /etc/network/interfaces
2006-11-04T06:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	nocturn	change eth0 for eth1
2006-11-04T06:58:00.000Z	nocturn		strange...
2006-11-04T06:59:00.000Z	nocturn		eth1 isn't  listed in dmesg
2006-11-04T06:59:00.000Z	nocturn		the VIA is eth0 there
2006-11-04T06:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	nocturn	or use /etc/iftab (man iftab)
2006-11-04T07:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	nocturn	do you have more than one eth card?? please paste the output of lspci, ifconfig -a and dmesg in a pastebin if possible

2006-11-04T07:04:00.000Z	nocturn		iftab does point eth0 to a different mac adress
2006-11-04T07:08:00.000Z	erUSUL		!better
