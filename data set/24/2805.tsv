2008-08-11T19:33:00.000Z	squiggle		hi all, i'm having problems automounting my shared partition. Works manually but won't automount, and i'm quite sure i've edited /etc/fstab properly.
2008-08-11T19:34:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	pastebin your fstab
2008-08-11T19:35:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	http://pastebin.com/d5c737409
2008-08-11T19:37:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	exact tabs are important in fstab. and there exists no "relatime". perhaps you mean "realtime"?
2008-08-11T19:38:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	anyway the problem i'm having is with the last line only, partition in question is /dev/sda2
2008-08-11T19:39:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	your ext3 option is wrong as I told you and the last line need proper tabs
2008-08-11T19:39:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	okay thanks. i'll go try read and fix that. the partition is fat32 not ext3.
2008-08-11T19:39:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	I know
2008-08-11T19:40:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	but I was wrong about the ext3 relatime option
2008-08-11T19:40:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	okay... sorry. i'm a bit slow at all this. so how do i fix it? put in the tabs properly?
2008-08-11T19:41:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	yes. fat alos needs some options, like uid, gid and the like
2008-08-11T19:42:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	/mnt/sda2 vfat umask=077,uid=1000      will that do? i read it off a howto
2008-08-11T19:44:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	yes. pretty much
2008-08-11T19:52:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	didn't work :( still didn't mount
2008-08-11T19:55:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	sorry bout that.
2008-08-11T19:55:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	about what?
2008-08-11T19:56:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	about not telling you what the problem was. anyway i rebooted and same problem, the shared partition didn't mount
2008-08-11T19:57:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	add "auto," int he options
2008-08-11T19:58:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	yes. and don't froget the defaults
2008-08-11T20:00:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	after that edit, still didn't work
2008-08-11T20:00:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	manually mounting it works? pastebin your current fstab
2008-08-11T20:02:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	yup i just confirmed that manually mounting works. did sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/osshare and it worked fine. current fstab is http://pastebin.com/m66687dd1
2008-08-11T20:03:00.000Z	wols	squiggle	don't. to check your fstab entry, just jsue mount /dev/sda2
2008-08-11T20:05:00.000Z	squiggle	wols	somehow, when i didn't change anything the last time i rebooted, it worked. i dunno what you/I did right though. lol. happily ever after for me
