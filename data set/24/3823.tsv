2008-04-25T10:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	what ubuntu version are you running and what video card?
2008-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	i'm running hardy heron and I have an ATI V5200 video card
2008-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	both fglrx and the open source drivers support aiglx now
2008-04-25T10:47:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	ok, so I guess aiglx is better than xgl? How do I install this cuz currently I cannot enable compiz, I get "desktop effects could not be enabled" when I try to from system>>preferences>>appearence
2008-04-25T10:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	what drivera re you using for your video card?
2008-04-25T10:48:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	I can't tell. In gutsy, I was prompted on my first boot up to install restricted drivers, but for Hardy I was not asked that, nor could I find the option in System>>administration. How can i check which driver I am using?
2008-04-25T10:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	hrrm i'm not entirely sure as xorg.conf no longer displays the driver in use
2008-04-25T10:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	try running the restricted drivers thing manually
2008-04-25T10:50:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	yea so i'm kinda stuck. I just did a clean install. the other day i upgraded from gutsy, and got compiz to work after installing xgl but it was sluggish and buggy, so i'm trying to find alternatices
2008-04-25T10:50:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	how do I run it manually if its not in my menu?
2008-04-25T10:53:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	how can I run the restricted drivers thing manually?
2008-04-25T10:53:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	i'm not sure how to do it on ubuntu, but in kubuntu it appears in the menus as 'hardware drivers manager'
2008-04-25T10:54:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	its weird, becaus the ATI Fire GL driver is checked but it says not in use. what could cause that?
2008-04-25T10:55:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	i have no idea
2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	try running: acpi -V
2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	i got some text but no temp reading
2008-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	then you must have no temperature sensors accessible via acpi
2008-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	it worked in gutsy thoughh. shoud I just reinstall lm-sensors?
2008-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	does 'sensors' no longer show it?
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	dystopianray	what do you mean by 'sensors'?
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	ezzieyguywuf	'sensors' the program
