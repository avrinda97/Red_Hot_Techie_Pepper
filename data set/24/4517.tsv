2007-03-22T08:19:00.000Z	chas3d1		hey mates! can anybody help me with a wifi card?
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	depends, i'm a noob but i just got mine working
2007-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	i just got my bcm43xx working, sec i'll get you a link
2007-03-22T08:22:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	for legal reasons, ubuntu can't include the driver.  What you basically do is get the windows driver then use a program to make it work with linux.  A step-by-step guide is here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174
2007-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- thanks mate. Any words of wisdom?
2007-03-22T08:24:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	read it carefully, ctrl shift v is paste in terminal, be careful not to copy a space in front of the commands
2007-03-22T08:24:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- haha, I've run into that problem before!
2007-03-22T08:24:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	 and download http://boredklink.googlepages.com/wl_apsta.o as the guide says
2007-03-22T08:31:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- just let me know when you're back
2007-03-22T08:34:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	how's it goin?
2007-03-22T08:35:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- it says it can't find the package
2007-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	do you have internet on the computer right now?
2007-03-22T08:36:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- of course
2007-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	do you have restricted enabled?
2007-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	sorry, universe
2007-03-22T08:37:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- what is that?
2007-03-22T08:39:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	it's another repository.  Basically a server that apt-get looks at and can download from.  did you do step 1 of the instructions?  1 ) Ensure you have access to the other ubuntu repos
2007-03-22T08:39:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- i will do that right now
2007-03-22T08:40:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	cool, then try sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter again
2007-03-22T08:40:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- i just did it. we are back in business
2007-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	did you download that file to your desktop yet?
2007-03-22T08:41:00.000Z	chas3d1	eV64	- it has just completed
2007-03-22T08:42:00.000Z	eV64	chas3d1	good.  on to step 4
