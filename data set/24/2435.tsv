2010-10-11T21:01:00.000Z	luichi		is there any way to see ubuntu installation log?
2010-10-11T21:03:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	from an installed system, you can look in /var/log/installer/
2010-10-11T21:03:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	I'm not sure its the same from the live CD
2010-10-11T21:05:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	i installed ubuntu 10.10 from a live usb and now i'm using it but i had one warning in the installation i want to see
2010-10-11T21:05:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	in /var/log/installer there are any readeable file
2010-10-11T21:06:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	so the directory is empty, or you just get permission denied errors?
2010-10-11T21:07:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	ah, most of the files in that directory can only be read by root
2010-10-11T21:07:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	there are files in the directory but i can't read them
2010-10-11T21:07:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	are you using the command line or a GUI editor?
2010-10-11T21:08:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	i have a file called initial-status.gz and if i open it has a file called inital-status which is readable
2010-10-11T21:08:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	but i think it's not from ubuntu installation
2010-10-11T21:09:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	I have that file
2010-10-11T21:09:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	but the other files in that directory look more interesting
2010-10-11T21:09:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	but how you read them'
2010-10-11T21:10:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	what editor are you using?
2010-10-11T21:10:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	gedit
2010-10-11T21:10:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	it can only read media-info
2010-10-11T21:10:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	then open up a console, and run sudo gedit
2010-10-11T21:12:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	ok fine now i can read them :) thanks
2010-10-11T21:12:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	i will see if i find the warning if not i will tell you
2010-10-11T21:14:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	ok i think i found it :)
2010-10-11T21:15:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	in that directory there are only things related to ubuntu installation?
2010-10-11T21:16:00.000Z	brendan0powers	luichi	I would think so
2010-10-11T21:16:00.000Z	luichi	brendan0powers	ok
