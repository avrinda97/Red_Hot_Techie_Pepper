2006-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	jonah1980		i'm trying to install a newer version of tellico on my 64bit dapper
2006-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	jonah1980		did the configure step and got that error
2006-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	my guess: "sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-dev"
2006-07-07T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	you could use auto-apt to see what exactly it is trying to find
2006-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	"sudo aptitude install auto-apt", then "sudo auto-apt update", and then in the program's directory, "auto-apt run ./configure"
2006-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	but *don't* just blindly answer "yes" to every package it proposes to install, because that way you'll pollute your system with useless packages.
2006-07-07T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	just ignore all the packages it asks you to install, until you can pinpoint the one it's actually missing
2006-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	how will i know which one to answer yes to?
2006-07-07T08:20:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	perhaps you can use the "-s" switch of auto-apt ("auto-apt -s run ./configure"), that way it will not ask you to install, it should just list the packages instead
2006-07-07T08:13:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	just answer no to everything. when, eventually, the configure fails with that X error, take note of the *last* package that it proposed you to install. then tell me which package it was, and we'll see if it looks like the right one
2006-07-07T08:18:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	i've clicked cancel like a million times and it's just going on forever! is there not an easier way?
2006-07-07T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	in these cases, i'd usually just ask you to point me to the URL for the program you're trying to install. however, since i'm using 32 bit Kubuntu, i'm not sure it'd help too much in this case
2006-11-14T10:06:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	perhaps you need sudo
2006-11-14T10:08:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	always unmounted
2006-11-14T10:14:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	what's the best thing to use to fix and repair a disk for an ipod, it's a 20gb drive but someone told me fsck won't do anything or fix anything anyway
2006-11-14T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	honestly i don't know
2006-11-14T10:15:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	also how do i unmount it without ejecting it? when i eject the command doesn't work cos says no such device
2006-11-14T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	doesn't umount work?
2006-11-14T10:16:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	unmount command not found it says when i type that
2006-11-14T10:16:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	i said "umount"
2006-11-14T10:17:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	that works but it just says "/dev/sdf2: 2740 files, 2103150/4862201 clusters" and nothing else so i don't know if the thing is in good condition or not??
2006-11-14T10:17:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	i wanted to repair or mark bad sectors etc and make sure it was in good working order
2006-11-14T10:18:00.000Z	LjL	jonah1980	i told you - i don't know. "umount" is just to unmount the device
2006-11-14T10:18:00.000Z	jonah1980	LjL	sorry i know you've been a great help
