2008-12-16T00:14:00.000Z	almark1	DasEI	Is there a way to downgrade xorg in Ubuntu and keep the version distro?
2008-12-16T00:15:00.000Z	DasEI	almark1	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6275059  , the radeon/fglrx of ubuntu should work, moni is also to be configured manually; we can try if the ati installer works, but I don' think so
2008-12-16T00:16:00.000Z	DasEI	almark1	hardy would run it fine
2008-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	almark1	DasEI	but hardy woudn't be compatible with newer programs, right? like compiz and games and ardour2?
2008-12-16T00:18:00.000Z	DasEI	almark1	hardy is well supported
2008-12-16T00:18:00.000Z	almark1	DasEI	I am using Ubuntu studio 8.10, is there a ubuntu studio for hardy?
2008-12-16T00:19:00.000Z	DasEI	almark1	yes, but don't ask me about it's drivers
2008-12-16T00:19:00.000Z	almark1	DasEI	thanks for the info
