2009-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	gharz		guys, i've been having sleepless nights with these hash sum mismatch whenever i run apt-get update... how do i fix this? i've been searching google but can't find the solution :( please help
2009-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	gharz		how do i re-install or reconfigure my apt-get and keys
2009-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	gharz		?
2009-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	your mirror may be corrupt, try the official ones
2009-01-10T13:45:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	i didn't change anything since it has been installed... how do i fix the keys?
2009-01-10T13:46:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	i remember last time there's a site in ubuntu wherein i can generate my sources.list and instructions on how to get the gpg keys
2009-01-10T13:46:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	reinstall the package ubuntu-keyring
2009-01-10T13:47:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	i think the gui system > administration > software sources should allow you to reset to the original ones
2009-01-10T13:47:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	i ran dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-keyring and the message was "Automatic..." not changed
2009-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	and by 99% i'm getting a message saying bzip2: Data integrity error when decompressing ... blah blah
2009-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	run apt-get --reinstall install, change your apt sources
2009-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	ok i'll try that
2009-01-10T13:56:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	i'm still getting this error => W: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/intrepid-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2  Hash Sum mismatch
2009-01-10T14:07:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	how do i get a key from ubuntu? i've restored my sources.list back up and i'm getting this error now... => W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com intrepid Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5
2009-01-10T14:09:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	well the way i know is install ubuntu-keyring, there are probably better ways of verifying it, that is a warning not an error
2009-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	the apt-key util handles this, apt-key netupdate,  though i have never done this
2009-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	ok thanks so much...
2009-01-10T14:12:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	apt-key net-update didn't work :(
2009-01-10T14:13:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	should i export mine and send it to you?
2009-01-10T14:14:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	what does apt-key list show?
2009-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	i think it's working now.
2010-06-19T20:34:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	there may be something wrong with the device itself
2010-06-19T20:35:00.000Z	gharz	dns53	can't it be reformated? but the system can detect it when i checked it with dmesg
2010-06-19T20:35:00.000Z	dns53	gharz	well it seems like something physically wrong with the device (though i may be wrong)
