2010-04-26T20:10:00.000Z	mylisto		yes
2010-04-26T20:11:00.000Z	mylisto		yes I do
2010-04-26T20:12:00.000Z	mylisto		it is now :D
2010-04-26T20:13:00.000Z	mylisto		my other major problem is this...
2010-04-26T20:13:00.000Z	mylisto		I just got in a really bad accident...
2010-04-26T20:13:00.000Z	mylisto		but hey I saved a ton of money by fleeing the scene of an accident :D
2010-04-26T20:13:00.000Z	mylisto		no, but seriously - there is a vdi file I need to move (virtualbox file) - says its too big..
2010-04-26T20:14:00.000Z	mylisto		at most its 10 gigs...I have at least like 30 gigs free on the drive
2010-04-26T20:14:00.000Z	mylisto		hmm
2010-04-26T20:14:00.000Z	mylisto		how can I check?
2010-04-26T20:14:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	sudo fdisk
2010-04-26T20:14:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	my guess is it is FAT32
2010-04-26T20:15:00.000Z	mylisto		thats right...fat32
2010-04-26T20:15:00.000Z	mylisto		so I'm screwed?
2010-04-26T20:16:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	you could backup everything on it and reformat as NTFS if you need it to work with windows
2010-04-26T20:17:00.000Z	mylisto	switch10_	I can't backup the stuff..
2010-04-26T20:17:00.000Z	mylisto		I just want to move this one damn file to the drive...argh
2010-04-26T20:18:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	then yes you are "screwed" no matter what the platform.  FAT32 cant have file sizes bigger than 4gb ish.  I don't remember the exact size
2010-04-26T20:19:00.000Z	mylisto	switch10_	is it possible to break the file down in size?
2010-04-26T20:19:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	did you format it is fat32 or did it come like that?
2010-04-26T20:19:00.000Z	mylisto		came like that
2010-04-26T20:20:00.000Z	mylisto		96.5 gigs free
2010-04-26T20:20:00.000Z	mylisto		but its fat32...
2010-04-26T20:20:00.000Z	switch10_	mylisto	thats garbage.  I cant believe WD is formating stuff with fat32 still
