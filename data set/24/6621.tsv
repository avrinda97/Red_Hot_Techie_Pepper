2005-09-10T13:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	shoot
2005-09-10T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	I said above ``What style of proxy is it?''
2005-09-10T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	SOCKS, HTTP, etc.
2005-09-10T13:51:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	what port does it use?
2005-09-10T13:52:00.000Z	lopingo	Razor-X	all same, 8080
2005-09-10T13:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	it's a local proxy hmmm?
2005-09-10T13:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	how did you configure your Firefox?
2005-09-10T13:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	local as in, it points to something on your LAN
2005-09-10T13:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	as in, you went inside Gnome and configured the Ethernet settings _and_ the browser?
2005-09-10T13:55:00.000Z	lopingo	Razor-X	i think no the browser, just ethernet settings
2005-09-10T13:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	so X Chat works, but Firefox doesen't?
2005-09-10T13:56:00.000Z	lopingo	Razor-X	yeap
2005-09-10T13:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	you have tried Firefox without any proxy settings, correct?
2005-09-10T13:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	Firefox works without the proxy, I presume?
2005-09-10T13:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	as in, without a proxy on the system at all
2005-09-10T13:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	or is your connection totally proxy-dependant?
2005-09-10T13:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	like I said, I would reccomend a network dump, but for someone that can read that right, it can be on the verge of privacy peering, and it's a bit hard for the average user to sift through
2005-09-10T14:00:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	get ethereal and make a dump
2005-09-10T14:00:00.000Z	lopingo	Razor-X	ok
2005-09-10T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	wait, you're using Ubuntu in vmware?
2005-09-10T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	install Ethereal in Linux
2005-09-10T14:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	lopingo	have you tried something other than Firefox?
2005-09-10T14:04:00.000Z	lopingo	Razor-X	im gonna try opera or dillo
