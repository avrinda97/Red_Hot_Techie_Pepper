2006-01-25T09:33:00.000Z	Xenarchy		my ATI FireGL T2 128mb card in my IBM T42p laptop is being picky or something. I upgraded to the fglx drivers and all has gone to hell.
2006-01-25T09:33:00.000Z	Xenarchy		I *think* I got it stable now but I'm still not sure.
2006-01-25T09:34:00.000Z	Xenarchy		nope sitll broken. /sigh I guess I'll have to reinstall.
2006-01-25T09:35:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	What were you using before?  Can you 'downgrade' to that, or is it insufficient for you?
2006-01-25T09:37:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	If you switch to a console, you can reconfigure the xserver to use the OSS driver instead.
2006-01-25T09:37:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	i can't even do that. the screen just stays blank
2006-01-25T09:37:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	ctrl + alt + F2 gives you a blank screen?  (ctrl + alt + F7 should take you back to the gui)
2006-01-25T09:38:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	I think something got screwy when I did sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-01-25T09:41:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	...
2006-01-25T09:42:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	even in the console my display is all screwy. I think something went wrong durring hte install.
2006-01-25T09:43:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	That sounds seriously messed up... changing a video card driver shouldn't mess up the console. o_O
2006-01-25T09:44:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	everything was fine till I did apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-01-25T09:45:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	i think what might have killed it was that I did it as sudo instead of root? or perhaps the fact that I turned the root user on to make installing ruby easier.
2006-01-25T09:45:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	I doubt it... that's fairly standard stuff.
2006-01-25T09:46:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	mmm I'll just reinstall. I'm just glad I havn't started my research yet
2006-01-25T09:46:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	k, sorry I couldn't help more
2006-01-25T09:47:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	no problem. you've been more than enough help. I don't expect anyone to troubleshoot over IRC
2006-01-25T09:47:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	One last thing...
2006-01-25T09:47:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	Are you using a CRT monitor?
2006-01-25T09:49:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	no ... and i just figured out that it is a hardware issue
2006-01-25T09:49:00.000Z	Xenarchy	PuMpErNiCkLe	i went and rebooted only to see the IBM boot logo all screwed up
2006-01-25T09:49:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	ouch :-/
2006-01-25T09:50:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	If it's an LCD, does it have an auto-configure button on it? (Mine does - it may help)
2006-01-25T09:51:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Xenarchy	I'm not much of a hardware debugger, though, so that's about all I can offer. o_O
