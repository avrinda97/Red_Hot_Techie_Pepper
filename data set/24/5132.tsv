2007-03-14T14:39:00.000Z	dilch		do any of the gstreamer plugins allow Ryhthmbox to play wmas? If so , which one?
2007-03-14T14:40:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	Have you tried UbuntuGuide ?
2007-03-14T14:40:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	yep
2007-03-14T14:41:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	Tried play the file with totem ?
2007-03-14T14:41:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	not yet. I'm just trying to get all the default programs to work nicely first
2007-03-14T14:42:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	gstreamer (or any Linux MPs in existence) cannot play DRM-ed WMAs
2007-03-14T14:42:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	yeah, these aren't DRMed
2007-03-14T14:43:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	did you try it with mplayer ?. Can't all WMAs you have be played ?
2007-03-14T14:45:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	yes, i can play them in mplayer
2007-03-14T14:46:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	media format supports in Edgy is pretty clunky compared to Feisty, but WMA is entirely possible, can you pastebin all the gstreamer packages you have installed ?
2007-03-14T14:46:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	well i'm just installing ffmeg now, so i'll tell you how that works out
2007-03-14T14:47:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	all -good/bad/ugly and their -multiverse counterpart should be installed. You'll no longer have to worry about playing any of them.
2007-03-14T14:47:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	it's taking a while - have massive packet loss to the US today
2007-03-14T14:48:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	take your time. Btw, Feisty is in a stable state to use daily. My uptime is 7 days without a hitch now.
2007-03-14T14:49:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	heh, my best freebsd box uptime is 124 days ... have to reboot soon though ...
2007-03-14T14:50:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	yeah, but anything more than 1 week uptime is considered suitable for desktop daily use, IMO.
2007-03-14T14:51:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	yes, of course ... i just wanted to brag about uptime ;)
2007-03-14T14:52:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	you beat me to it :p the longest I've had is around 60 days.
2007-03-14T14:53:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	ok, ffmpeg didn't do it, so i'll install the rest of the gstreamer plugins and see how I go. I should just stick with xmms (which i usually use) but i really want to get it working in Ryhthmbox for once :)
2007-03-14T14:53:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	heh we have a solaris box at work that has been up for almost 3 years .. i kid not
2007-03-14T14:53:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	and the convenient preview feature of nautilus.
2007-03-14T14:54:00.000Z	fnf	dilch	not really extraordinary for a real server, but I have a laptop. 60 days without kernel updates is not quite good.
2007-03-14T14:54:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	exactly
2007-03-14T14:55:00.000Z	dilch	fnf	that's why the freebsd server is getting rebooted soon
