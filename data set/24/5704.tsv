2006-05-19T09:39:00.000Z	Shadow_mil		When I bootup my ubantu, it does not go stright into the the grapical mode, but it says "Brezzy badge" and ask me login under a command shell, whats wrong?
2006-05-19T09:40:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	what is wrong is your using something that isn't released yet.  please ask in #ubuntu+1 so they can help you either debug it or point you to where you can post on bug tracker
2006-05-19T09:42:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	my appologies for some reason i thought you were using dapper ... nm, stick around someone might know
2006-05-19T09:42:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	tell us where exactly it is stuck?
2006-05-19T09:44:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	I think its not loading the grapical stuff on boot up, I am getting ready to check the boot process see if I disabled anything I should not have
2006-05-19T09:44:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	your able to log in via command line?
2006-05-19T09:47:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	yeah
2006-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	I think I might have found my problem
2006-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	then your allright.  debugging this can be hard as it can be anything
2006-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	Whats the login shell for the GUI?
2006-05-19T09:50:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	login is loging for your account, it doesn't matter how you login, l/p is always the same
2006-05-19T09:50:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	I am on kubantu btw
2006-05-19T09:52:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	just login using your login name and pass you created at install
2006-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	your loging in your account, it makes no difference whether you use shell interface, kde interface or some futurama parapsychic interface :0
2006-05-19T09:53:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	holycow	then why do I get a command line when I login?
2006-05-19T09:54:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	what? do you get a graphical login menu or do you get a black screen (shell) login menu?
2006-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	it sounds like it confuses you too
2006-05-19T09:55:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	okay stop talking and start listening a bit
2006-05-19T09:56:00.000Z	holycow	Shadow_mil	or ask more specific questions about solving the problem
