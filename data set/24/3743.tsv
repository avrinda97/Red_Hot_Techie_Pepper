2008-07-11T14:51:00.000Z	gluonman		I can't get flash to work with Mozilla firefox.
2008-07-11T14:52:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	what does it do instead of working?
2008-07-11T14:52:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	umm... not work
2008-07-11T14:52:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I can't watch youtube videos, for instance.
2008-07-11T14:54:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	did you close all firefox windows after installing flash?
2008-07-11T14:54:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	yes. I downloaded the tar.gz file from adobe's website and extracted the installer and then ran it in terminal and then opened firefox and youtube still doesn't display videos.
2008-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	don't go to adobe's website
2008-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I've been through this process before. As soon as I upgraded to 8.04 it seems my old flash stopped working.
2008-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	what should I do alternatively?
2008-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	just install the package flashplugin-nonfree
2008-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I did.
2008-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	not quite working.
2008-07-11T14:56:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	did you do "about:plugins" ?
2008-07-11T14:57:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I'm not familiar with that.
2008-07-11T14:57:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	in firefox's url bar
2008-07-11T14:57:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	let me check that out.
2008-07-11T14:59:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I'm looking at the information. It just mentions gnash, etc. which are things I've already installed. No further directions.
2008-07-11T14:59:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	uninstall gnash
2008-07-11T15:00:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	alright.
2008-07-11T15:01:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	I uninstalled it.
2008-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	sn9	gluonman	try youtube now
2008-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	alright.
2008-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	wow. I guess gnash was just getting in the way.
2008-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	gluonman	sn9	thank you.
