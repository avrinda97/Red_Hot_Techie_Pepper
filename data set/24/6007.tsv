2008-07-07T00:37:00.000Z	achilles		hello everyone
2008-07-07T00:38:00.000Z	achilles		wondering if someone could help me with a video problem?
2008-07-07T00:38:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	I'll take a stab at it, what do you need?
2008-07-07T00:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	Please type people's names when you're talking to them so they hear you.
2008-07-07T00:44:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	I would try checking the Restricted Drivers section to see if any are available.
2008-07-07T00:45:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	where is that located
2008-07-07T00:45:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	That should be under System->Administration
2008-07-07T00:51:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	Are you making any progress?
2008-07-07T00:52:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	I recently reconfig my xorg.conf to get my tablet and mouse to work is it possible that something got messed up in there or would that not make a difference.
2008-07-07T00:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	Well, I would say it's certainly possible. xorg.conf controls A LOT of different aspects of the OS after all.
2008-07-07T00:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	I suppose I could try, although I'm not very good at reading those system files. There weren't any restricted drivers, I assume?
2008-07-07T00:57:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	no there were not
2008-07-07T01:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-07-07T01:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	What model is your card specifically?
2008-07-07T01:18:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	did you get that?
2008-07-07T01:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	Yeah, but there wasn't much to read.
2008-07-07T01:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	What's your card's specific model?
2008-07-07T01:19:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	S3 via unichrome km400
2008-07-07T01:21:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	I set it back to the default using the back up I had to see if that would fix it so that is all default nothing config in it
2008-07-07T01:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	achilles	Are you running Hardy Heron?
2008-07-07T01:26:00.000Z	achilles	bobertdos	Yes
