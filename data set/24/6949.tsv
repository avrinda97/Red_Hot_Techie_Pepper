2005-06-12T13:41:00.000Z	Hajuu		no? Well that seems silly
2005-06-12T13:41:00.000Z	Hajuu		howso?
2005-06-12T13:43:00.000Z	Hajuu		So I dont want people on my computer to be able to see the files in there
2005-06-12T13:43:00.000Z	Hajuu		well that seems like a silly setup... cant I just have the webserver run as myself?
2005-06-12T13:44:00.000Z	Hajuu		Why's that?
2005-06-12T13:45:00.000Z	Hajuu		:(
2005-06-12T13:45:00.000Z	Hajuu		heh
2005-06-12T13:45:00.000Z	Hajuu		well
2005-06-12T13:47:00.000Z	Hajuu		no its unix that is making it needlessly complicated.. all I want is to be able to have one folder in my users home directory act as my doc_root... and have the webserver user be able to access the files held within (blockable by htaccess files) but not have anyone else logged on on my pc to be able to access it..
2005-06-12T13:49:00.000Z	Hajuu		find ~/dir/ -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod ugo=rx ; find ~/dir/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod ugo=r :: ok.. explain to me what your solution does
2005-06-12T13:50:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	I think man find will give you all the information.
2005-06-12T13:54:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	you add #!/bin/bash in the first line, then make your file executable
2005-06-12T14:56:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	what player are you using?
2005-06-12T14:59:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	killall esd and try again.
2005-06-12T15:00:00.000Z	Hajuu	Fikrann	 nope.. no good
2005-06-12T15:05:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	you should try running this from terminal: killall esd && vlc <your file>
2005-06-12T15:10:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	install totem-xine
2005-06-12T15:17:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	 cat /proc/ide/hdc/settings
2005-06-12T15:26:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	what the error was?
2005-06-12T15:27:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	its -dONE not -dLETTER L
2005-06-12T15:29:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	if you have new drive, you can try higher udma mode, for even more data transfer.
2005-06-12T15:29:00.000Z	Hajuu	Fikrann	 Will it break anything? heh
2005-06-12T15:31:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	it won't break anything, unless you change parametres while writing to disk.
2005-06-12T15:31:00.000Z	Fikrann	Hajuu	there are udma modes 1-6.
