2010-04-09T01:34:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	did you check  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2010-04-09T01:34:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i know how to do that, the one disk must have been scratched, when i retried the other it worked:-\
2010-04-09T01:36:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	do you want to reinstall grub and eitch version do you use
2010-04-09T01:36:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	grub says error 11: invalid device string; i don't know what to do at this point
2010-04-09T01:37:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i'm capable of doing things, i just don't know what to do. can/should i reinstall? do I try to figure out the issue?
2010-04-09T01:38:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	read  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Resolving an "Unrecognized Device String" (Error 11)
2010-04-09T01:38:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	::sigh:: i swear to god i googled this
2010-04-09T01:39:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	just let me know if it works for you
2010-04-09T01:39:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	all: is there a way to see that w/o https? i can't view https pages at the moment
2010-04-09T01:41:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	: you can not use browser ?
2010-04-09T01:44:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	that whole section didn't seem familar at all. my errors were more readable and i don't recall any chaining option
2010-04-09T01:46:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i always can't find the grub menu file:(
2010-04-09T01:46:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	:did you fresh install karmic or it was upgrade from Jaunty
2010-04-09T01:46:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	upgrade from 8.04 to 9.10
2010-04-09T01:47:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	: all steps or directly
2010-04-09T01:47:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i let apt take care of it
2010-04-09T01:48:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i mean the update manager
2010-04-09T01:49:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	because since karmic instead of grub now is grub2
2010-04-09T01:49:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i'll take your word for it; i have no idea but nothing on that page looked familar
2010-04-09T01:50:00.000Z	zvacet	gp5st1	it is now my word it is fact karmic use grub2 instead of grun witch was on previous versions
2010-04-09T01:52:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	i believe that completly, there was just no chanload option in grub
2010-04-09T02:00:00.000Z	gp5st1	zvacet	there is no chainloader or anything in this menu.lst file
