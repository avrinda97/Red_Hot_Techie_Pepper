2005-10-24T07:19:00.000Z	Ron_o		MS is great on the front end, but the back end kills you.
2005-10-24T07:19:00.000Z	Ron_o		and linux and other OS are great on the back end but are horrible on the front end.
2005-10-24T07:19:00.000Z	Ron_o		I just want something that works adn is somewhat cheap.
2005-10-24T07:21:00.000Z	Ron_o		there are many free progs on Windows, but most are just limited, demo versions.
2005-10-24T07:22:00.000Z	Ron_o		I think the money is the key. Not many of us can afford all these progs and clients to make our system really work.
2005-10-24T07:22:00.000Z	Ron_o		most of us just steal the apps..
2005-10-24T07:22:00.000Z	Ron_o		I don't like doing that... not anymore.;->
2005-10-24T07:23:00.000Z	Ron_o		I actually have tried a few linux OSs.
2005-10-24T07:23:00.000Z	Ron_o		the problem came when I wanted more apps. I didn't know how to get them to work.
2005-10-24T07:24:00.000Z	Ron_o		I think ubuntu will be popular and is popular because it makes many of the choices for you.
2005-10-24T07:24:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	i disagree
2005-10-24T07:25:00.000Z	Ron_o	DShepherd	it uses Gnome, and not KDE..
2005-10-24T07:25:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	I use Gnome not KDE either
2005-10-24T07:26:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	and you can choose how it partitions...
2005-10-24T07:32:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	on a linux box?
2005-10-24T07:32:00.000Z	Ron_o	DShepherd	no, Win98
2005-10-24T07:32:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	makes sense now
2005-10-24T07:33:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	why?
2005-10-24T07:34:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	WinME is scary
2005-10-24T07:34:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	You mean VISTA? :)
2005-10-24T07:35:00.000Z	Ron_o	DShepherd	I guess that's what it's called now.
2005-10-24T07:40:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	Openoffice
2005-10-24T07:41:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	and much more
2005-10-24T07:42:00.000Z	DShepherd	Ron_o	they dont have to either
