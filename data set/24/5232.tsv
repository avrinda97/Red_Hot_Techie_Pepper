2006-11-12T10:40:00.000Z	graeme		Package mozilla-dev is not installed.

2006-11-12T10:48:00.000Z	graeme	effie_jayx	well the dapper debs have unmet dependencies that aren't in the repos. Installing anything on Linux that's not in the repos is usually a major pain in the ass ... IMO
2006-11-12T10:48:00.000Z	effie_jayx	graeme	 well I haven't had the need to isntall things that are not in the repos... but some stuff . like Eclipse SDK is better from outside thant the version in the repos
