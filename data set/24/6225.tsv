2005-12-16T07:18:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	it may be that xmms' lock file is still in place, check ~/.xmms for it
2005-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	ssdd534	BlueDevil	what is the file called?
2005-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	it should have lock in the filename
2005-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	ssdd534	BlueDevil	i dont see anything with lock.... everything in here is right (i think :/ )
2005-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	you can post the error in pastebin if you want

2005-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	weird, did you install a theme or something while xmms was running?
2005-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	ssdd534	BlueDevil	i tryed plain a wma and GDM died after i restarted GDM it wouldnt run
2005-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	did you try rebooting?
2005-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	ssdd534	BlueDevil	not yet...
2005-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	i thought of suggesting cleaning /tmp, but that would screw up things...
2005-12-16T07:46:00.000Z	ssdd534	BlueDevil	thanks the reboot did it
2005-12-16T07:46:00.000Z	BlueDevil	ssdd534	yw
