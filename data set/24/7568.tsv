2004-10-25T11:09:00.000Z	rapha		Hmm
2004-10-25T11:10:00.000Z	rapha		A friend is just trying to install Ubuntu on his notebook. He boots from CD, presses Enter, then "something loads" and then "my screen goes black and stays black". What should he do?
2004-10-25T11:12:00.000Z	rapha		Does isolinux let you edit the kernel command line? (Does the Ubuntu installer work without framebuffer?)
2004-10-25T11:13:00.000Z	rapha		Aaah okay
2004-10-25T11:13:00.000Z	rapha		That easily
2004-10-25T11:13:00.000Z	rapha		Thanks Kamion
2004-10-25T11:15:00.000Z	rapha		(Wondering why though, I never had a problem with that on the console)
2004-10-25T11:17:00.000Z	rapha		:-)
2004-10-25T11:19:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	Kamion: utf will save the world. all the world's children, use utf-8!
2004-10-25T11:20:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	A friend of mine has a different opinion: "This crappy UTF-8-shit, can't stand it".
2004-10-25T11:20:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	i could do with latin-1 or latin-9 but that's just plain selfish
2004-11-12T16:37:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	so your boss is allowing you to IRC at work?
2004-11-12T16:37:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	i'm "on the field" when i irc :)
2004-11-12T16:37:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	aaaah! :)
2004-11-12T16:41:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	Then you have a well-trained boss. "Checks are good, trust is better" :)
2004-11-12T16:42:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	we're a multidiciplinary research center. nobody undersands another's work
2004-11-12T16:42:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	:)
2004-11-12T15:14:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	i'd do that with at or perhaps even sleep
2004-11-12T15:19:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	Well, right now I'm using sleep and a calculator to determine how many seconds I need the computer to sleep before it should wake me with music. But that means that (1) I always have to do some calculations before I can go to bed and (2) it doesn't work with Muine, only with mplayer or the like.
2004-12-01T16:48:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	i think you have mistaken vodka for beer :)
2004-12-06T17:10:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	there's documentation that lists system calls. there's even man pages for the posix calls
2004-12-06T17:10:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	But for being able to read those manpages you need to know what the respective call is called
2004-12-06T17:12:00.000Z	rapha	topyli	That only lists manpages from section 8 when called with halt/reboot/shutdown. That's why I asked here if somebody knew something.
2004-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	topyli	rapha	dunno, there's a debian package called man-posix or similar. it might help. not that i know much :)
