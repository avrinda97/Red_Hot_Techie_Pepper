2008-08-01T08:03:00.000Z	Blaqlight	CostaRicanQuaker	make sure you set another Window Manager BEFORE you remove it.
2008-08-01T08:04:00.000Z	Blaqlight	CostaRicanQuaker	are you in KDE or gnome?
2008-08-01T08:07:00.000Z	Blaqlight	CostaRicanQuaker	check your system tray, there should be a blue looking box type thing.
2008-08-01T08:10:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Blaqlight	what do i do now? i went ot system preferences and the last tab says windows
2008-08-01T08:13:00.000Z	Blaqlight	CostaRicanQuaker	best way is ps ax | grep compiz-fusion

2008-08-01T08:14:00.000Z	Blaqlight	CostaRicanQuaker	if its not running it will return nothing, if it is, it will show which process it is
