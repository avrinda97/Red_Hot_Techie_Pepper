2008-03-09T05:21:00.000Z	^4nDr3s		how can i mount a fat16 partition, like this??? sudo mount -t msdos /dev/sdaX /media/disc
2008-03-09T05:22:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	yep, you probably don't need the -t msdos part as mount should recognize it automagically.
2008-03-09T05:23:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	yeah the thing is that it is not recognizing it, could the partition table or disc be corrupted?
2008-03-09T05:23:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	what's the error message?
2008-03-09T05:24:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	something like this... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58935/
2008-03-09T05:25:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	it doesn't matter if i specify the filesystem or not, it shows the same message
2008-03-09T05:25:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	vfat is fat32, you said the partition was fat16
2008-03-09T05:25:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	i know, i tried doing it with msdos (the other was an example)
2008-03-09T05:26:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	it does not matter if i use the -t option or no option, it shows the same message
2008-03-09T05:26:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	ok, are you sure you have the correct partition?
2008-03-09T05:27:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58936/
2008-03-09T05:27:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	i was thinking that maybe that partition is corrupted or maybe the partition table...
2008-03-09T05:28:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	ok, have you tried runnign ckfs on it?
2008-03-09T05:28:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	nope, i will do it now, thanks ;)
2008-03-09T05:29:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	sorry fsck
2008-03-09T05:29:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	thanks i will do it know!
2008-03-09T05:29:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	yw
2008-03-09T05:31:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	if you're not sure, you can always image the partition and do whatever you want on the image file instead of the partition, that way you won't accidentally further corrupt stuff on the partition.
2008-03-09T05:31:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	how do i do that?
2008-03-09T05:32:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	dd if=/dev/hda6 of=/path/to/image/file
2008-03-09T05:32:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	then you would need to use -oloop when mounting the image file
2008-03-09T05:32:00.000Z	^4nDr3s	pajamian	thanks i'll try that too ;)
2008-03-09T05:33:00.000Z	pajamian	^4nDr3s	just make sure you have enough space to create an image file which will hold the entire partition.
