2009-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	Dracie_		yeah i looked at that, i was hoping there was a more clear cut article, but i'll look at that again
2009-01-08T08:55:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	do you know whether MobileMe is using a POP or iMap server?
2009-01-08T08:58:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	take a look at this link: 'http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=658662" It seems to discuss what you are looking for. Let me know...
2009-01-08T09:02:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	it works thanks
2009-01-08T09:03:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	so I assume MobileMe is using an Imap server?
2009-01-08T09:03:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	it can use pop3 but you have to contact mobileme support to enable it - i like imap more anyways
2009-01-08T09:03:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	yeah me too
2009-01-08T09:04:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	you use .mac too?
2009-01-08T09:05:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	No but I am a Mac user. I traded a friend an old iMac (G3) for an everex Laptop so I decided to check out Ubuntu with it...
2009-01-08T09:05:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	cool, get debian on there... better mac support i think
2009-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	still trying to get a handle on Ubuntu not sure if I want to add another dimension to this learning experience I've been having...
2009-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	debian isn't that much harder
2009-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	Probably not it just took way too much time to get Ubuntu isntalled on this machine due to the video card (driver) issues. Dont think I want to relive that again. For example:
2009-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	oh... the worst video driver issue i had was gentoo live 2008.1 set my X with radeon drivers which doesn't work with my card
2009-01-08T09:11:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	no such luck here with vesa or openchrome. Had to do a text based install with Hardy alternate CD then do update via terminal/console all the while my  by hands were being held these great chaps on the forum...
2009-01-08T09:14:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	Linux is still a new world for me so I want to tread slowly. My intention is to get my children used to using Ubuntu/Edubuntu as well the Mac & PC so I'm concentrating on Ubuntu for now.
2009-01-08T09:15:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	good idea, is there a big difference with edubuntu than ubuntu?
2009-01-08T09:16:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	do you know of any resources for mac users entering into the Linux/Ubuntu environment. It may be easier to get some work down by mimicing the OS X environment in the beginning
2009-01-08T09:17:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	not to sure as I erased it off the computer when I first got it but it seems like a wonderful resource for learning and my children are all doing on line school (k12.com)
2009-01-08T09:18:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	there is a project to make a linux machine look like a mac graphically
2009-01-08T09:18:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	i would do a dual boot ubuntu and mac os x system
2009-01-08T09:19:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	meaning install OS X (10.5) onto this laptop (everex stepnote NC1502)?
2009-01-08T09:23:00.000Z	Dracie_	marabout	look at the private chat i initiated
2009-01-08T09:23:00.000Z	marabout	Dracie_	will do
