2006-08-09T07:52:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		help anyone please?
2006-08-09T07:52:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		I have two partitions, i want to shrink the first one and expand the second one to use the freed space
2006-08-09T07:53:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		shrinking the first one works, but expanding the second one doesn't.
2006-08-09T07:53:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		this is the output from parted: 1      32.3kB  8390MB  8390MB
2006-08-09T07:53:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		 2      18.0GB  48.0GB  30.0GB
2006-08-09T07:53:00.000Z	BeeRockxs		resize 2 8390MB 48GB gives this error message: Error: Unable to satisfy all constraints on the partition.
2006-08-09T07:54:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	^^ what i said above
2006-08-09T07:54:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	neither is mounted azureal, I booted with a live cd
2006-08-09T07:57:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	Dodzey: any idea?
2006-08-09T07:58:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	if it was busy then i was going to suggest something, but since the error is of a different nature, idk
2006-08-09T08:04:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	so you're trying to resize it so that it expands "left" (for lack of a better word)
2006-08-09T08:04:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	yep
2006-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/features.php
2006-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	perhaps you need 'the required software' e2fsprogs
2006-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	i have them installed.
2006-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	is this a SATA hd?
2006-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	nope, plain old IDE
2006-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	hmm, it seems that parted does not support changing the start of an ext2 partition,
2006-08-09T08:13:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/resize/resizing.htm
2006-08-09T08:14:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	the parted documentation says that I can't change the start of a partition when resizing an ext2 partiton :(
2006-08-09T08:15:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	 somewhere i also read that you can't move your ext2 or ext3 partitions
2006-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	of course, if all else fails, you could backup your ext2, remove the ext2 partition, and create a new (primary) one
2006-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	BeeRockxs	azureal	which would require back-up space for 20GB, which I don't have :(
2006-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	azureal	BeeRockxs	yea, when you first said that you'd be expanding "left", i had a feeling it would be difficult...
