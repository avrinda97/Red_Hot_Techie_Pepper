2008-05-31T03:35:00.000Z	Taza		M2N4 + AMD 5000+ power saving + Ubuntu LiveCD == KERNEL PANIC (acpi). Noacpi means X doesn't start. Help?
2008-05-31T03:36:00.000Z	Taza		NOT A PEBKAC
2008-05-31T03:36:00.000Z	Taza		NOT AN USER ERROR
2008-05-31T03:38:00.000Z	Taza		HARDWARE IS OKAY, CD IS OKAY, USER IS EXPERIENCED: M2N4 + AMD 64 x2 + Ubuntu LiveCD == KERNEL PANIC. Suggests disabling acpi. I do that and X fails to start.
2008-05-31T03:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	Stop it.
2008-05-31T03:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	there is a coc .. maybe you should read it
2008-05-31T03:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	Read the rules of the channel and stop arguing
2008-05-31T03:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	no reason to bring it into here with you
2008-05-31T03:53:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	My frustration with ubuntu failing to work with the mobo?
2008-05-31T03:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	your entire attitude
2008-05-31T04:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"   .. Even if the cd checks out.. burn a new copy at a very slow speed.  it does make a difference.  and turn off power management in your bios
2008-05-31T04:08:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	The CD is valid. 100% valid.
2008-05-31T04:08:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	I've done a hundred ubuntu CD's, the CD is valid, and that's the end of that, thank you.
2008-05-31T04:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	Doesnt matter.. even if it md5's  copies burned slow will often work.. as seen on many many dell and hp's
2008-05-31T04:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	take your attitude and leave
2008-05-31T04:10:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	I have intense familiarity with all these parts. I know what the CD drives do and what they can handle.
2008-05-31T04:10:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	However, apparently acpi=off is doing something.
2008-05-31T04:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	sorry I mentioned it
2008-05-31T04:11:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	Watch cal1, I think he got the same problem.
2008-05-31T04:13:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	Don't worry, hang on rc.local
2008-06-01T18:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	With the dd command
2008-06-01T18:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Taza	yes dd works fine for that.. would you like a link
2008-06-01T18:55:00.000Z	Taza	Jack_Sparrow	Preferably.
