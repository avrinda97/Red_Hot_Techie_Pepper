2011-05-28T18:00:00.000Z	anddam		Atheros AR9285
2011-05-28T18:00:00.000Z	anddam		checking, thanks
2011-05-28T18:02:00.000Z	anddam		AR9285 (>= 2.6.29) , install kernel is 2.6.38 so that should be fine
2011-05-28T18:02:00.000Z	anddam		is there an ubuntu package for that driver?
2011-05-28T18:02:00.000Z	anddam		or do I need with m-a (or equivalent)
2011-05-28T18:02:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	what version ubuntu?
2011-05-28T18:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	you sure the router is setup to accept connections from the netbook? (i.e. no mac filtering or such)
2011-05-28T18:10:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	Doesn't appear that it is on the 11.04 dvd
2011-05-28T18:11:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	I somehow thought I couldn't install without an internet connection, I'll just install from iso image for now
2011-05-28T18:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	have you 'dmesg | grep -i network' to see if you can spot any messages from NetworkManager?
2011-05-28T18:11:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	nope, I've been reading syslog
2011-05-28T18:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	It say anything?
2011-05-28T18:13:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	quite a few lines but it's not connected so pasting is a bit difficult
2011-05-28T18:14:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	understandable
2011-05-28T18:15:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	the kernel says that AP denied authentication (status 13)
2011-05-28T18:19:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	everything I keep seeing during research is coming up with "woops, I had mac filtering on my AP" :(
2011-05-28T18:21:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	I don't, this is actually "internet sharing" options of OS X and I've been connecting with several devices, including another notebook, iphone, ipad and android devices
2011-05-28T18:22:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	actually there isn't an easy way to set MAC address filtering without fiddling with ipfw
2011-05-28T18:22:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	Hrm, ok.
2011-05-28T18:59:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	or was I discussing this with you? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/660864
2011-05-28T19:00:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	did you find the solution?
2011-05-28T19:01:00.000Z	anddam	rationalOgre	nope but I'm reading while installing
2011-05-28T19:40:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	Do you have the system up and running?
2011-05-28T19:40:00.000Z	rationalOgre	anddam	System > Administration > Time & Date?
