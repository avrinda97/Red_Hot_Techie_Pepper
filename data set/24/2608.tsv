2008-10-28T01:15:00.000Z	mxweas		I did manual partitioning
2008-10-28T01:15:00.000Z	mxweas		so at the end of the install it says I have windows installed and if thats my only other os to put grub in the master boot record. Otherwise to place it somewhere else
2008-10-28T01:15:00.000Z	mxweas		where do I place it? I have mac os x installed and it does not see it
2008-10-28T01:16:00.000Z	mxweas		k
2008-10-28T01:16:00.000Z	mxweas		im guessing placing grub in the master boot record will overwrite the current bootloader?
2008-10-28T01:16:00.000Z	mxweas		k
2008-10-28T01:17:00.000Z	TuxSympathiser	mxweas	to install ubuntu in mac you will need to use bootcamp
2008-10-28T01:17:00.000Z	mxweas		I am already using bootcamp
2008-10-28T01:17:00.000Z	mxweas		with rEFIt
2008-10-28T01:17:00.000Z	mxweas		and rEFIt can boot grub I believe
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas	xipy	?
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas		but at the end of this install it asks to where to put grub
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas	xipy	I don't think grub can boot mac os x
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas		bootcamp can and it can boot grub as well
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas		but iono where to put grub
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	mxweas	xipy	?
2008-10-28T01:18:00.000Z	TuxSympathiser	mxweas	yes you are right you will need bootcamp to boot grub
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	TuxSympathiser	mxweas	what options does it give you?
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	mxweas		so at the end of ubuntu's install it asks where to put grub
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	mxweas		I type like /dev/ whatever
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	mxweas		sda1-5
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	mxweas		or anything
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	mxweas		but it doesn't say what the current partition ubuntu is on
2008-10-28T01:19:00.000Z	TuxSympathiser	mxweas	I would imagine that it is hd0,0 the same as if you were doing a normal pc install
