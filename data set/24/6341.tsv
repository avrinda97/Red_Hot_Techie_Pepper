2006-02-20T12:32:00.000Z	Mabus06		I'm trying to learn how WEP cracking is done to learn more about security. I got airsnort and am running it, and scanning channel 6 (which I think is the default one?), but I am getting two mac addresses.
2006-02-20T12:32:00.000Z	Mabus06		I don't want to interfere with what is potentially my neighbors router.
2006-02-20T12:32:00.000Z	Mabus06		So how do I find out which MAC address is mine and which is his?
2006-02-20T12:33:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 ifconfig should tell you which
2006-02-20T12:33:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 or traceroute to see which one your machine is routing through
2006-02-20T12:34:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 arp will list your arp cache - which will have your router's mac addy
2006-02-20T12:37:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	for ifconfig, under ath0 the hwadr is different than both mac addresses I'm picking up.
2006-02-20T12:38:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 for ifconfig that is the mac addy of the nic you're seeing.  i was thinking you could use the ip addy to identify the router - forgot you were looking @ mac addresses
2006-02-20T12:38:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 ditto the traceroute thing :] 
2006-02-20T12:38:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	hmmm, something strange, can I pm you?
2006-02-27T12:45:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 are you on the system currently?
2006-02-27T12:45:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	no, I'm on one beside it
2006-02-27T12:46:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 boot the rescue option and yeah, check /etc/hostname
2006-02-27T12:46:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	it just says 127.0.0.1 (or whatever that number is) localhost
2006-02-27T12:46:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 in /etc/hostname ?
2006-02-27T12:47:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	err, that was /etc/hosts/ hold on, I'll switch computers
2006-02-27T12:48:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	/hostname just says nicksmachine
2006-02-27T12:49:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 that looks ok...
2006-02-27T12:49:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	when I logged into gnome it said something about it being a valid internet address, or something strange like that
2006-02-27T12:49:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 in /etc/hosts on the line with 127.0.0.1   add nicksmachine at the end of the line.
2006-02-27T12:50:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain nicksmachine      <- like that
2006-02-27T12:50:00.000Z	Mabus06	wastrel	how come I never had to do this before? (brb)
2006-02-27T12:54:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 did that work?
2006-03-24T08:58:00.000Z	wastrel	Mabus06	 you have to either relog or source the file
