2008-07-02T12:04:00.000Z	kontagious		ï»¿i had ubuntu installed then i used the ubuntu live cd to resize the partitian with gparted and when i shrunk it it worked fine.. then i deleted the ntfs (windows) partitian and grew the ubuntu partitian now it gives me an "error starting operating system".. i then use gparted to check the ext3 partitian and it tells me it resized it and fixed a few things but ubuntu still wont boot
2008-07-02T12:04:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	grub error?
2008-07-02T12:05:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	the exact error is that above?
2008-07-02T12:08:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	should i try reinstalling grub?
2008-07-02T12:10:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	if there is a grub error, is that it? thought it was no operating system found or similar error
2008-07-02T12:11:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	im not farmiliar with grub.. i slept through that day in class :S
2008-07-02T12:12:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	my point is, is that if it does not state grub error 15, 17, or the like, then your issue is likely elsewhere-->having the exact error would be helpful in this case
2008-07-02T12:20:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	that is worrying
2008-07-02T12:21:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	uh oh
2008-07-02T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	you have backups?
2008-07-02T12:22:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	no but i can mount the partitian from thsi live cd
2008-07-02T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	best to do some backups (just in case we cant fix it)
2008-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	ok.. so what do you think we should try first
2008-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	i really think its a simple boot error
2008-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	you mounted the system and chroot'ed in?
2008-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	im not familiar with chroot
2008-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	ah then you got it handled, nice.
2008-07-02T12:26:00.000Z	kontagious	bazhang	do you think this would work http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351
2008-07-02T12:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kontagious	worth a try
