2006-10-29T15:29:00.000Z	pecisk	c0nf	you should enable Universe/Multiverse in System > Administration > Software Sources

2006-10-29T15:29:00.000Z	pecisk	c0nf	then it will ask for reloading lists
2006-10-29T15:29:00.000Z	pecisk	c0nf	and then install flash-nonfree
2006-10-29T15:30:00.000Z	c0nf	pecisk	why -nonfree? :)
2006-10-29T15:30:00.000Z	pecisk	c0nf	it indicates it comes from nonfree repositories of Debian

2006-10-29T15:34:00.000Z	c0nf	pecisk	sorry for bothering you, but does 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' works for you?
