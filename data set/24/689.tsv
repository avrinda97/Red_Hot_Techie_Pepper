2011-03-15T19:02:00.000Z	Curly_Q		lol
2011-03-15T19:02:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	well i know how much is being used
2011-03-15T19:03:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	my linux partition is only 10gb
2011-03-15T19:04:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	im not overlapping
2011-03-15T19:06:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	i have a 220gb windows partition and only 104gb is being used
2011-03-15T19:06:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	therefore as long as i leave some extra space for windows i should be fine on data
2011-03-15T19:11:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	i have LVM in fedora.....
2011-03-15T19:13:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	i just want to give some space to fedora
2011-03-15T19:14:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	how would i do that?
2011-03-15T19:16:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	im on a laptop so would it be ok to run one of the os's on an external harddrive?
2011-03-15T19:17:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	i dont want to open the laptop though.... would an external work?
2011-03-15T19:18:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	also would i have to reinstall linux to move it to the external?
2011-03-15T19:19:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	would i have to reinstall linux to move it to the external drive>
2011-03-15T19:21:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	not a bad idea
2011-03-15T19:22:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	those things are like 100 dollars
2011-03-15T19:24:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	it would be cheaper to buy an external drive
2011-03-15T19:25:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	lol ill ask my parents (hint, hint
2011-03-15T19:25:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	ik

2011-03-15T19:26:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	i apologize :)
2011-03-15T19:27:00.000Z	skutr34	Curly_Q	ok so for now i think ill shrink windows a bit until i can get something like a shtick or an external drive
