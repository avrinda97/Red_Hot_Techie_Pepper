2006-12-21T11:53:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	in the prefs window, select the parts which you want to change colors; check the "use text box colors" box
2006-12-21T11:54:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	I don't see any such option
2006-12-21T11:55:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	Settings>Preferences>Interface>Input box>Use the Text box fonts and colors
2006-12-21T11:55:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	same for User list
2006-12-21T11:58:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	the Colors page changes the text box colors
2006-12-21T12:01:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	the 0-31 are available colors for text. don't worry too much about them for now. you're probably most interested in Foreground and Background
2006-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	usernames can be colored by checking the 'Colored nicknames' box under Text box settings
2006-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	you can play with the 0-31 colors to get things just the way you want.. i don't recall which number does what, but a little playing will tell you
2006-12-21T12:05:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	looks like 14 and/or 30 affect how your text appears to you (doesn't change how it looks to others)
2006-12-21T12:06:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	ok, I have changed the colors 14 and 30 to blue
2006-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	no problem :)
2006-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	Are you able to see my text color and my user name in blue?
2006-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	no. those color settings will only affect how you view text
2006-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	you show up green for me unless you type my name.. then you show up red
2006-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	Then how come I could see your messages and user name in red color?
2006-12-21T12:09:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	oh ok
2006-12-21T12:09:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	now i'm hilighted...
2006-12-21T12:11:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	Oh ok. highlighting means typeing the nick name before the message?
2006-12-21T12:13:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	that's actually done by your client.
2006-12-21T12:14:00.000Z	cntm	n8of9	Cool. Thanks a lot for all the info provided and clearing my doubts !!!
2006-12-21T12:15:00.000Z	n8of9	cntm	anytime
