2008-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	maybe it's time for a video card upgrade :)
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	the riva128 is just an old card. heck, how much memory does the one you have even possess? A lot of acceleration-type stuff will crap out if too little memory is present
2008-02-09T10:33:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	switching to a depth of 16bpp helped fix rendering issues for me with an old ATI Radeon Mobility chipset. There was too little video memory for acceleration at 24/32bpp
2008-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	it's a "real" agp interface and 32m ram i think...
2008-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	the wiki page says the riva128 it came with 4-8mb
2008-02-09T10:35:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	the pci does,  but the agp is higher
2008-02-09T10:36:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	try bumping the depth down to 16 in your xorg.conf, it might help
2008-02-09T10:37:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	no can do.  it does 24,15,8,...  no 16 avalable
2008-02-09T10:46:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	run lspci -vvv and it should show how much video memory you have if you wade through it
2008-02-09T10:49:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	you'll want to find this sort of entry: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55313/
2008-02-09T10:49:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	i guess you wanted this http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/?show=d5d6c89a9  ?
2008-02-09T10:50:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	well try 15bpp is my best suggestion. that card may not even be able to use all 32mb for a framebuffer
2008-02-09T10:51:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	ok.  but why not use 24 bit colour ?
2008-02-09T10:52:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	because the server may basically be running out of video memory in trying to enable acceleration
2008-02-09T10:55:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	what do you get when you do: glxinfo | grep direct
2008-02-09T10:55:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	was i right about how much ram it has btw ?   cause that's what M$ reports on it.
2008-02-09T10:56:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	ummm right now.  -root: glxinfo: command not found
2008-02-09T10:56:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	it's split into 16M prefetchable and 16M non-prefetchable....so it is 32M, the way it's segregated like that makes me wonder if it's old enough that some of the memory may be for 3D textures only and can't be used otherwise
2008-02-09T10:57:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	that might explain why my scrollback buffer is kinda short in console....   makes sense
2008-02-09T10:58:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	you should have glxinfo (well, mesa) installed if you hope to have ANY OpenGL acceleration at all. apt-get install mesa-utils
2008-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	honestly you can pick up, say, a Geforce2MX for pennies used though, I wouldn't expend a lot of effort on such an old card
2008-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	k  but htat will have to be some other time.   i'm not installing x on this particular system.    (several shoes here)
2008-02-09T11:01:00.000Z	nuffin	mjw-	actually this box had an ati card in it,  that's why it now has my old standby riva  ;/
2008-02-09T11:02:00.000Z	mjw-	nuffin	Geforce2mx might be the cheapest option that will probably be fairly well supported. ;)
