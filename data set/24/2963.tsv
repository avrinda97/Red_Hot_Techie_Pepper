2009-06-27T08:28:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	you want to know about eee?
2009-06-27T08:29:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	if the video card is just bad or what
2009-06-27T08:29:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	well, I have a 1000HE and the vid card is fine.  Its Intel.   Try checking out Array.org maybe?
2009-06-27T08:30:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	array was the first thing i switched to because its faster
2009-06-27T08:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	cool, are you using the lean/eeepc version?
2009-06-27T08:31:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	no the first selection
2009-06-27T08:31:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	should i be using the second selection for eee?
2009-06-27T08:33:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	well, might as well try it...  I think.  Its experimental in that it strips out all drivers but the eee, and compiles them inline.
2009-06-27T08:33:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	should i do both commands to remove and install? i mean to remove what i have and install the eee?
2009-06-27T08:33:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	no, you can install multiple kernels
2009-06-27T08:34:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	do you recommend to install the eee one and just leave the one i have also?
2009-06-27T08:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	yeah, as a rule of thumb.  I personally haven't done much playing with it, I don't think I've even tested the eee one.  But, its always good to install kernels side by side at first.  Just in case the new one doesn't work.
2009-06-27T08:37:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	i don't see instructions for eeepc lean
2009-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	http://array.org/ubuntu/setup-jaunty.html    search for linux-netbook-eeepc
2009-06-27T08:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	assuming you are running jaunty!!
2009-06-27T08:39:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	it don't say lean. anyhow, whats the difference between linux-netbook and linux-netbook eeepc?
2009-06-27T08:40:00.000Z	danbhfive	zaccour	the name was changed for jaunty.  And its just as I described, AFAIK
2009-06-27T08:41:00.000Z	zaccour	danbhfive	are linux-netbook and linux-netbook-eeepc different?
