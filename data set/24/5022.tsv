2006-11-11T07:30:00.000Z	gpastor		kqemu?
2006-11-11T07:30:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	yes, a kernel module made by the creator of qemu (qemu is gpl licenced free software, kqemu is proprietry though)
2006-11-11T07:32:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	oh I see. However, it does speed any OS virtualized? or it only works being LInux the guest?
2006-11-11T07:32:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	you can have any guest os, you can also use windows or linux as the host os
2006-11-11T07:33:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	the guest os will run with approximately 5% slowdown
2006-11-11T07:33:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	if you have xen and a vt enabled cpu you can run your guest at near natiive speed
2006-11-11T07:33:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	you are kidding? I thought that vmware run 50% slowdown.
2006-11-11T07:34:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	I guess I am wrong :-P
2006-11-11T07:34:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	I am talking about qemu, xen i have no idea about vmware
2006-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	to run windows as a guest with xen you must have the supporting cpu, most dont yet support it though
2006-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	 qemu + kqemu,
2006-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	correct, you can run that on any cpu
2006-11-11T07:35:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	I don't pretend to do such a thing, But it is important to be aware of these things
2006-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	with qemu you could conceivably run winxp on an ipod :P would take centuries to do anything though :P
2006-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	it would be nice to see what happens when touching the ipod wheel
2006-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	bsod, of course :)
2006-11-11T07:37:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	you know you can boot a linux kernel on ipods right?
2006-11-11T07:38:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	opens up more functionality, ability to watch movies, different audio formats, doom even
2006-11-11T07:38:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	yes, I do.... but I don't have an ipod
2006-11-11T07:38:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	damn, thought i was imparting new information :)
2006-11-11T07:38:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	a friend of mine who has one, told me about (he didn't dare to do it though)
2006-11-11T07:39:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	tell him it is easy and you can always reset to factory settings with the download from apple website
2006-11-11T07:39:00.000Z	variant	gpastor	even if it goes badly wrong
2006-11-11T07:39:00.000Z	gpastor	variant	but he needs to backup the songs ... I don't know if he wants to :-P
