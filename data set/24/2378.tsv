2009-05-30T01:52:00.000Z	icqn		there are no updates for ubuntu since two weeks, is ubuntu bankrupt?
2009-05-30T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	nope.. it's just perfect now.. no need for any more updates.. ever... ;)
2009-05-30T01:54:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	but.. on a more serious note.. I'm not sure if I've seen any updates for a while here either.. might just be that there hasn't been any.. you can try switching mirrors to see if the one you're using has stopped updating for some reason
2009-05-30T01:55:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	it is everything else as perfect, the poorest edition ever!! too many issues i have, bug reports submitted, no responses at all since many weeks!!!
2009-05-30T01:56:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	issues like nautilus crashes bad packages, and an acpi freezes on shutdown!
2009-05-30T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	well.. I'm terribly sorry your system crashes.. I will try to be more careful in the future
2009-05-30T01:58:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	are you developer?
2009-05-30T01:58:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	nope
2009-05-30T02:00:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	i am thinking to switch to another distro
2009-05-30T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	do you have a question you want to ask?
2009-05-30T02:01:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	are you trying to stop me that way?
2009-05-30T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	If you have a specific question about ubuntu I might be able to help you... I have no interest in listening to what you think about ubuntu or if you're going to switch distros...
2009-05-30T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	there is an offtopic channel for that kind of chatter
2009-05-30T02:09:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	why are you so sure that you are able to help? for example how to change easily between languages for spellchecking in application like xchat, pidgin? in gentoo, opensuse, for example there is an item in pop-up menu for that, is there a package in ubuntu witch brings that support?
2009-05-30T02:12:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	I'm not sure I can help...I just said I might be able to help you if you asked specific questions.. I'm not sure how xchat does it spellchecking.. if it's done by xchat I'm guessing there is a setting somewhere in one of xchats many config files.. if it's a system wide spellcheck I would guess it would use the language set in localization settings.. pidgin does the spellchecking by itself if I recall correctly..
2009-05-30T02:15:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	they all do, the question was how to change between spelling languages...
2009-05-30T02:15:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	I'm looking around in my pidgin stuff.. I'll get back to you if I find something useful
2009-05-30T02:17:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	it is not application dependent! this item in popup menu is for all input fields available
2009-05-30T02:17:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	like an item for "Input Methods" for example
2009-05-30T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	mm.. pidgin seems to use that.. xchat uses aspell.. or you're using gnome-xchat?    http://t0x.in/xchatspellchecking.html
2009-08-03T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	you mean it splits up the input into separate words?
2009-08-03T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	or something like "more" or "less"
2009-08-03T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	icqn	or even "most" which I personally like
2009-08-03T17:44:00.000Z	icqn	Slart	thank you.
