2012-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	everstt		This has been troubling me a lot. Ubuntu 12.04 (and the ones before that) was super fast when I first installed it... but over time as I installed more and more softwares, it got slower and slower... it's not unbearable but I miss the fast Ubuntu. I thought this progressive degradation was supposed to happen with Windows only. Do you have familiar experiences?
2012-05-15T07:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 not reaqlly. if somthing is installed but not running . no extra resources are used except hd space
2012-05-15T07:41:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	that should be the case... but I've noticed it everytime!
2012-05-15T07:43:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	neo_ Did I install something that slows my computer down?
2012-05-15T07:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 we dont know what you are installing...
2012-05-15T07:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 you may need to clarify whats getting slow. and check htop for resource hogs
2012-05-15T07:48:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	the application start time gets slow
2012-05-15T07:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 what software? just load times are longer? the apps still run fine?
2012-05-15T07:49:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	yes just the load time... wait, the GIMP healing tool was very very slow
2012-05-15T07:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 you mean just the load times.. of the apps of os get longer?
2012-05-15T07:52:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	yes just the load times.
2012-05-15T07:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 that points to a hd bottleneck, or hw issue to me. id check dmesg output regullary
2012-05-15T07:54:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	I don't know what to look for in the dmesg output.
2012-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 anything that looks like an error, or hd related
2012-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	ok I'll try that... but as everything was working fine after a clean install, do you think it is hd bottleneck?
2012-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 hd may have bad spots near the middle that get used after you start installing.. hard to tell
2012-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	here's an observation... when my current user account gets very very slow, I sometimes create a new user and it gets a little bit faster (not as a clean install, but faster)
2012-05-15T07:58:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	hmm hadn't heard of that... is there some way to not use the bad spots?
2012-05-15T07:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 i partioned my drive around them as a dirty fix untill i got a new hd.
2012-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	I have a new hd!
2012-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	everstt	 ive had new hds die...
2012-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	maybe a smaller partition size will help? with all the other partitions not mounted automatically
2012-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	neo_ btw I have a 64-bit setup
2012-05-15T08:03:00.000Z	everstt	dr_willis	neo_ I don't think this is going to be solved right now :) ...I'll check the dmesg output later and see if there's anything there... Thanks.
