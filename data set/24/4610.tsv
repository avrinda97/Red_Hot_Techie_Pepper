2007-03-10T12:20:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Does anyone know of a way to do a basic text only install without ever touching X or fb?
2007-03-10T12:20:00.000Z	Rei-chan		I'm using that, unfortunately, and it jumps right to fb.
2007-03-10T12:20:00.000Z	Rei-chan		As in, it uses a framebuffer grub boot.
2007-03-10T12:20:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Second I select something, boom, reboot.
2007-03-10T12:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	By fb you mean the blue tex-based "dialog" installer with grey menus?
2007-03-10T12:21:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	No, by framebuffer, I mean the pretty graphical boot screen that comes on Ubuntu 6.10 Alternative.
2007-03-10T12:22:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	Oh, the image that appears in console when it gives you boot options? I don't know anything which gets rid of that... why is it a problem?
2007-03-10T12:22:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	For some reason, when I boot the CD, and select an option, the box reboots.
2007-03-10T12:22:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	The last time I installed an OS on this box, it was Gentoo, and the Gentoo Framebuffer installer would do the same thing. Non-framebuffer text install worked.
2007-03-10T12:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	That's weird... I don't know anything useful, sorry. = /
2007-03-10T12:23:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	I've turned off ACPI, and everything else I can think of. When it gets to loading the kernel, boom. Reboot.
2007-03-10T12:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	Life is too short to run gentoo. :)
2007-03-10T12:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	Won't the liveCD be better for that, then? It doesn't use a framebuffer IIRC, it goes from the text prompt straight to X.
2007-03-10T12:25:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	I was thinking about that, but can the LiveCD handle 88 MB of RAM?
2007-03-10T12:25:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	This box is old.
2007-03-10T12:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	...no. xD
2007-03-10T12:25:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	Yeah, that's the problem. :)
2007-03-10T12:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	You could install something debian-based like Damn Small, and then switch repositories?
2007-03-10T12:26:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	That's an idea, I could also use CentOS since we use it in-house, just... I wanted Ubuntu and all. :(
2007-03-10T12:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	a) Why? b) Once you install dsl, go to /etc/apt/sources.list and change the repositories to ubuntu, then grab the packages you need.
2007-03-10T12:28:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	Once DSL is up, and I switch sources, I can just do xubuntu-desktop?
2007-03-10T12:28:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	Most likely... there might be a few interesting conflicts, but if you're reasonably good with apt, you'll probably be fine.
2007-03-10T12:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	Rei-chan	That is, theoretically, yes you can. It will find and install it. In practice, there might be package conflicts which you'll have to resolve.
2007-03-10T12:29:00.000Z	Rei-chan	arrenlex	I suck at apt. :)
