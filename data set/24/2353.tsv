2009-01-15T00:42:00.000Z	Nightchill		how to fix my no-sound-in-firefox problem?
2009-01-15T00:43:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	what in firefox would play sounds? the flash player?
2009-01-15T00:43:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	yep
2009-01-15T00:44:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	yeah, and i've installed restricted package, and adobe flash
2009-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	it might be that pulseaudio is running and takes control over the sound device
2009-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	you should try to either make pulseaudio work with ALSA or deactivate pulseaudio.
2009-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	how do i make them work together
2009-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	Which version of Ubuntu do you run (8.04)?
2009-01-15T00:47:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	make sure the flashplayer's version is at least 10, and do the following in a terminal `asoundconf set-pulseaudio' ... i think that should do it
2009-01-15T00:48:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	flash version is 10, and it's set to Headset cause i don't have speakers
2009-01-15T00:48:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	can you try speakers setting (what kind of setting is that?)?
2009-01-15T00:49:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	like i said, i have logitech's usb headset and my asoundconf gives me 2 options "nForce2 Headset"
2009-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	could you just for the sake of testing try all possible settings?
2009-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	yeah, I'll do that now
2009-01-15T00:53:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	does not work
2009-01-15T00:54:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	hm ... that's weird ... it's all that came to my mind now
2009-01-15T00:55:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	yeah,i  have no clue either. guess i'll just remove ubu and give my arch boot some more hdd space
2009-01-15T00:55:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	you could also deactivate pulseaudio
2009-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	well, i'll try that out too
2009-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	that may be easier - just remove the pulseaudio packages and set all application to use ALSA instead
2009-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	ALSA usually works just fine
2009-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	alsa does not work for me
2009-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	chrisj	Nightchill	why is that?
2009-01-15T00:57:00.000Z	Nightchill	chrisj	alsa worked till i replaced my speakers with usb headset
