2009-04-07T22:55:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		Why do you need to defrag before re-partitioning your HD (to do a dual boot) if it's all getting erased anyways?
2009-04-07T22:56:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		and... if it's all getting erased by re-partitioning, then won't Windows disappear into oblivion too?
2009-04-07T22:57:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		O-o
2009-04-07T22:57:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		ok... well all the docs about re-partitioning say "omg, you'll lose everything so make sure to backup your files"
2009-04-07T22:57:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		which is... "misleading"
2009-04-07T22:58:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		no, XP, which I guess can live with partitions made by the installer
2009-04-07T23:00:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	tar.bz2 ?:)
2009-04-07T23:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sequethin	what about gzip?
2009-04-07T23:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		which may or may not be something totally unrelated :P
2009-04-07T23:01:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	tar+gzip or tar+bzip2 are both alternatives to rar
2009-04-07T23:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		ok, cool
2009-04-07T23:01:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	but gzip and bzip2 are only compressors, you still need tar to keep the directory structure
2009-04-07T23:02:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sequethin	/me lies: "Yes, I knew that" >_>
2009-04-07T23:02:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	haha another alternative would be to create a loopback disk image with whatever file system you wanted, and the compress that :)
2009-04-07T23:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sequethin	maybe, but that sounds scary XD
2009-04-07T23:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		I don't really need to know, was just curious
2009-04-07T23:03:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	that's pretty extreme but if you're making an iso image it's basically the same thing
2009-04-07T23:03:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	i'll shut up about it now :)
2009-04-07T23:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sequethin	or you could remind me what I'll have to do after installing intrepid to get mp3 and other similarly-evil file formats to work :)
2009-04-07T23:05:00.000Z	sequethin		hahah that information is easily available. actually i use amarok because i love it and when i try to open an mp3 file with amarok the first tiem it says "omg u have no mp3 support, wanna get it?" and i say yes, and it gets it :)
2009-04-07T23:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sequethin	thanks - sounds good to me... I guess something similar will happen for video codecs?
2009-04-07T23:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		now to figure out if my mp3 player can become an ogg vorbis player :P
2009-04-07T23:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		which would be ... fucking awesome
2009-04-07T23:07:00.000Z	sequethin	Mike_lifeguard	hopefully :)
