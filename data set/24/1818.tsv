2010-01-13T10:01:00.000Z	jyncka		I can't seem to get my apache set up with virtual hosts, if I want the url to be http://localhost/vhost what directive do I use?
2010-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	lol what?
2010-01-13T10:03:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	vhosts allows for different settings to be applied given the hostname found in the http request
2010-01-13T10:03:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	the hostname is the part between :// and the next /
2010-01-13T10:03:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	but doesn't ServerName and ServerAlias need to be set in the vhost file?
2010-01-13T10:03:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	so in your example, the hostname is localhost
2010-01-13T10:04:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	ah so would I need to create a subdirectory?
2010-01-13T10:04:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	apache is not very particular about in what file you set that up in, as long as it gets included by another configuration file that gets loaded
2010-01-13T10:04:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	no, vhosts have nothing to do with directories or subdirectories. you'd never put a configuration file (except .htaccess) under a directory accessible to the public anyhow
2010-01-13T10:05:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	http://eregie.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/manual/vhosts/name-based.html
2010-01-13T10:05:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	thanks, but in that example it says ServerName www.domain.tld
2010-01-13T10:06:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	yes, what are you trying to say?
2010-01-13T10:06:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	I'm just not sure what I need to set mine to, it seems like an important setting but maybe I'm confused
2010-01-13T10:06:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	the purpose of vhosts is so that you can access the server using different host names and get different data
2010-01-13T10:07:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	why do you want vhosts?
2010-01-13T10:07:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	I want to set up separate development environments for a few different websites and this seemed to make sense
2010-01-13T10:08:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	i also probably would question using ubuntu as a server system
2010-01-13T10:08:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	well this is more to make sure my code is working than anything else but I see your point
2010-01-13T10:09:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	what sort of technology are you developing atop?
2010-01-13T10:10:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	one wordpress site, one regular php-based site and playing with facebook development and python
2010-01-13T10:11:00.000Z	hdon	jyncka	ah, ok, well i recommend giving the apache manual a thorough reading. it's been a long time for me, so i'm very rusty, but i seem to recall becoming pretty proficient at it after reading a few manual sections about vhosts.
2010-01-13T10:11:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	when I get my new computer up I'll probably have something besides ubuntu running that can better serve as a server
2010-01-13T10:11:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	thanks, I do need to do that
2010-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	jyncka	hdon	thanks for the help as well and your patience
