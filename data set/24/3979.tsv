2007-08-14T15:21:00.000Z	Twelve-60		Hey, just wondering if it is possible to install ubuntu from a USB flash drive that is 256mb (maybe in parts or such)
2007-08-14T15:23:00.000Z	Twelve-60		Yes i know, however I'm wondering if there is a way to load it in parts or load an installer and get the rest over ethernet
2007-08-14T15:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	if youc an boot a USB device, you might be better off downloading and booting a Debian Etch ISO on that usb device
2007-08-14T15:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	do you have high speed?
2007-08-14T15:24:00.000Z	Twelve-60	IndyGunFreak	Yes
2007-08-14T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	the Debian Etch 4.0 ISO, is 159mb... it  basically loads the kernel, adn then installs everything else from the internet.
2007-08-14T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	if it detects your internet connection, that would be the way to go in your situation
2007-08-14T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	type this .. "/join #indygunfreak"
2007-08-17T05:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	so just install it.
2007-08-17T05:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	so how did you intend to install xubuntu?
2007-08-17T05:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	can that pc boot a usb thumb drive by chance?..
2007-08-17T05:57:00.000Z	Twelve-60	IndyGunFreak	I have tried
2007-08-17T05:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	i understand that, but can it boot a USB drive?
2007-08-17T05:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	like a thumb drive, or flash drive.
2007-08-17T05:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	then there's your answer, get a thumb drive, and boot the iso off of it... you'll probably need one at least 800mb.
2007-08-17T05:58:00.000Z	Twelve-60	IndyGunFreak	I told you I tried that and it couldn't find the ISO for some unknown reason
2007-08-17T05:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	oh.
2007-08-17T05:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	it probably wasn't on there as an image
2007-08-17T05:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	lol, ok.. well, i don't know...  maybe you could do a debian etch floppy install?
2007-08-17T06:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Twelve-60	have you looked intot hat option?
