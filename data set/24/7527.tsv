2005-01-09T09:37:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	be careful with distro mixing....... it will likely break other stuff if youre not a pinning expert
2005-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	Riddell	ogra	in all my years of doing such I've never had any problems
2005-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	with ubuntu ?
2005-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	there are many differences between warty and hoary.... and mixing is not supported at all
2005-01-09T09:40:00.000Z	Riddell	ogra	it doesn't cause any problems, it will upgrade any package that needs an upgrade, as long as the packages are made properly there's no reason it should go wrong
2005-01-09T09:40:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	i dont talk about kde, its the lower level where you will get breakages.... the official advise from mdz and jdub is either do a full upgrade or stick with warty... if aou are unhappy with hoary, reinstall
2005-01-09T09:41:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	lol

2005-09-25T11:26:00.000Z	Riddell	ogra	why does gnome-screensavers conflict with xscreensavers?
2005-09-25T11:27:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	because they clash
2005-09-25T11:27:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	you cant run both daemons
2005-09-25T11:34:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	what is in kscreensaver-xsavers ?
2005-09-25T11:35:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	so thats the daemon ? or are that the hacks ?
2005-09-25T11:35:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell	note that all hacks moved to xscreensaver-data
