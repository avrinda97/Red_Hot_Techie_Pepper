2008-02-29T23:30:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	did  you  sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ?
2008-02-29T23:32:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	Not yet, what will this do?
2008-02-29T23:33:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	because I saw some thing incorrect "BoardName      "vesa" and Modes      "640x480@60" "1600x1200@60"
2008-02-29T23:33:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	OK, I'll try that.
2008-02-29T23:46:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	bluefox83: Please find my new xorg.conf here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57854/ I used the command by xobius to reconfigure my X11, then re-enabled the nvidia driver (switched to a generic one), restarted the system. Problem is still the same.
2008-02-29T23:48:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	what is your monitor resolution?
2008-02-29T23:57:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	88-99 lines
2008-02-29T23:49:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	The LCD has a native resolution of 1680x1050 and is changed to 812x?? upon login.
2008-02-29T23:51:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	change the line 94, the resolution is incorrect
2008-02-29T23:52:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	OK, did that. Restarting X11 now, I'll be right back.
2008-02-29T23:55:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	Still the same problem. New xorg.conf here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57855/ Is it enough to hit ctrl-alt-backspace to restart X11?
2008-02-29T23:56:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	look ta this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57856/
2008-02-29T23:58:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	OK, you added a few modes, as I understand. Do you want me to change it to your version and retry?
2008-02-29T23:58:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	yes. try with it
2008-03-01T00:58:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	I'm back :) Your tip screwed my X system, I just got it to work again :)
2008-03-01T00:59:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	what happened?
2008-03-01T00:59:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	It disabled the drivers and I was only able to use the shell.
2008-03-01T01:00:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	I only add some screen modes
2008-03-01T01:01:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	I'm not blaming you, no need to defend yourself :)
2008-03-01T01:02:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	your monitor resolution is ok now?
2008-03-01T01:02:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	No, it's the same as before, but I'm a little tired now, I'll try it again tomorrow.
2008-03-01T01:02:00.000Z	Buyydee	xobius	I really appreciate your help, thanks.
2008-03-01T01:02:00.000Z	xobius	Buyydee	ok
