2007-09-23T10:25:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	what do you want to do?
2007-09-23T10:26:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	what is the file name of the theme?
2007-09-23T10:27:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Ok, the easy way is to open a terminal
2007-09-23T10:28:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	enter your password when prompted
2007-09-23T10:29:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	and then type cd /usr/share/cairo-clock/themes
2007-09-23T10:29:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	then type tar -zxvf 64568-Ninjja-Slim-Clocks.tar.gz
2007-09-23T10:30:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Then type exit (after it is all finished)
2007-09-23T10:31:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	 I made a mistake
2007-09-23T10:31:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	where is the theme file?
2007-09-23T10:32:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Ok so it is already in the themes folder?
2007-09-23T10:35:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	if the 64568-Ninjja-Slim-Clocks.tar.gz file is in /usr/share/cairo-clock/themes/ already, you just need to follow my instructions. If it is in a different folder you need to give the full path name to the file (if you can understand that :) )
2007-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Ok no worries, leave it there
2007-09-23T10:42:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	How did you go?
2007-09-23T10:43:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Lovely, do you know about man pages?
2007-09-23T10:45:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	Ok when you open up a terminal you have available documentation for most of the commands in Ubuntu
2007-09-23T10:45:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	all you need to do is to type in your terminal man <program name> to find all the documentation on that program name
2007-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	example: say you want to look at the manual page for tar
2007-09-23T10:46:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	so you type man tar
2007-09-23T10:47:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	use your keyboard arrows to scroll through the documentation, and the q key quits
2007-09-23T10:48:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	the man pages have been a huge help to me (and still are), also you learn heaps more too
2007-09-23T10:48:00.000Z	mechdave	koer	no worries, anytime
