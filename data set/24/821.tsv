2011-01-06T21:38:00.000Z	bonjoyee	SoftarPaul	yes..looking into it..also do you specifically need gnusound?..theres also audacity that does a similar job
2011-01-06T21:39:00.000Z	SoftarPaul	bonjoyee	Oh, it doesn't work? Well, I probably can use audacity instead. I want to do a remix of a song. Any tips of programs?
2011-01-06T21:39:00.000Z	SoftarPaul		Something like the Windows FL-studio
2011-01-06T21:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	SoftarPaul	audacity does a good job at that..try it..
2011-01-06T21:41:00.000Z	SoftarPaul		ediban and bonjoyee: Thanks. I maybe come back later with the result!
2011-01-06T21:43:00.000Z	bonjoyee	SoftarPaul	for issue with the compile ..check if libaudiofile is installed on your machine
