2006-06-13T10:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly - GStreamer plugins from the "ugly" set
2006-06-13T10:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	libdvdcss2 - portable abstraction library for DVD decryption
2006-06-13T10:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	you seem to be misspelling the package names
2006-06-13T10:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	that one is in seveas repository, unless you have a package that requires it, no
2006-06-13T10:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	red
2006-06-13T10:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	by prepending your irc nick
2006-06-13T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	by putting kiroh at the front of the line
2006-06-13T11:01:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	hello
2006-06-13T11:01:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	hello
2006-06-13T11:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	and i see that one in red, because it begins with eyequeue :)
2006-06-13T11:03:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	do tou know whi i cant see videos in totem??? i have installed all the things i need, but it still not work
2006-06-13T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	i don't know.  sometimes totem-xone works best one some machines, sometimes totem-gstreamer works best, try one and then try the other i guess
2006-06-13T11:07:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	i think i dont understand this ... what is the diference between totem-xine and totem-gstreamer???
2006-06-13T11:07:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	because i'm running only totem
2006-06-13T11:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	both use the totem front end (user interface) but they use xine or gstreamer as backends
2006-06-13T11:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	"sudo apt-get install totem-xine" and "sudo apt-get install totem-gstreamer" to switch between them, to see which works best there for you
2006-06-13T11:16:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	xine and gstreamer dont work, (what are the pakages i need to use totem-xine?? it can be that i dont have all of it)
2006-06-13T11:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	"sudo apt-get install totem-xine" would also install any dependencies you need
2006-06-13T11:17:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	then  none of the two works
2006-06-13T11:18:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	i had the same problem in breezy
2006-06-13T11:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	kiroh	that's too bad, i don't know what to suggest, other than another player such a vlc
2006-06-13T11:21:00.000Z	kiroh	eyequeue	it is strange, because i only hear the sound, but i see nothing
