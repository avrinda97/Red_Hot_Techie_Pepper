2009-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	sudo ifconfig -a
2009-12-06T19:41:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	ahhh would that be pan0 ???
2009-12-06T19:43:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	what gives you lspci | grep Network
2009-12-06T19:44:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	tried that, only brought me back to a command prompt
2009-12-06T19:45:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	ok iwconfig doesn't show any wlan0 or ra0 (do you know the make of your wifi card ?)
2009-12-06T19:46:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	 yah im pretty sure its the standard intlel 4965 abgn.  i think.  its an asus 1000he
2009-12-06T19:47:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	you have to pastebin your dmesg and the output of lspci -vvnn
2009-12-06T19:49:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	also is the interface activated on the BIOS ? F2 at the boot and then on board devices configuration check Enable is on the wifi
2009-12-06T19:51:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	ok will do that, lets take care of the pastebin first.  was thinking that too, but was wondering how in the world it would get shut off.

2009-12-06T19:52:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	I have a 701 (1st generation most of the time the problem involves the bios reversing to wifi disable)
2009-12-06T19:52:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	ehhhhhhhh really!?  weird!  ok, im going to see if that is the problem, brb.  actually wait, so what am i looking for in the bios???
2009-12-06T19:53:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	I think it is disable on your BIOS I don't see it on your pastebin
2009-12-06T19:53:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	on my 701 which I guess is close to your 1000H press F2 at the boot to go to the BIOS and then Advanced and then Device configuration
2009-12-06T19:53:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	yah i was just having a look, i dont see it either.  weird, ok, so anything im looking for in particular in the bios???
2009-12-06T19:54:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	cool!  ok, brb!!  thanks!
2009-12-06T19:54:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	then enable everything like audio ... lan ... F10 save and exit ...
2009-12-06T19:59:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	yup that was the problem.  thanks for the help, truly appreciated!  funny thing was i was thinking bios the whole time, but just couldnt believe that a setting would get changed there!  argh
2009-12-06T19:59:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	yeah it happens good that your problem was solved
2009-12-06T19:59:00.000Z	sasori2501	phil_fl	what an odd bug.  lol.  o well, everything is all happy again.  time to reinstall apps i purges because i thought it effected the wifi.... hahaha
2009-12-06T20:00:00.000Z	phil_fl	sasori2501	always check ifconfig then move to the lspci then bios, lspci and dmesg are verbose and show you what the system is taking care of.
