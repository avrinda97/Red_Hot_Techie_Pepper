2008-05-01T20:51:00.000Z	Hasone		hi
2008-05-01T20:51:00.000Z	Hasone		I've got a question for the ubuntu masters
2008-05-01T20:51:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	Then ask it.
2008-05-01T21:19:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	Nope...
2008-05-02T00:57:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-05-02T00:57:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	does that return any errors?
2008-05-02T00:58:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	I'll try it again. I have no internet, so it's been working off the cd. so far, it has some hash errors of some sort, I think. I'm going to try re-burning the cd, checking the md5, and then re-downloading f I have to.
2008-05-02T00:59:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	Don't tell errors in such a generic way... paste the output to paste.ubuntu.com
2008-05-02T00:59:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	I'll be upgrading for the next 20 mins to a half hour, I think.
2008-05-02T01:00:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	"errors of some sort" isn't helpful, there are many people those errors mean something to, so it's important to include them verbatim...
2008-05-02T01:00:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	thank you  :)
2008-05-02T01:00:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	do they have logs for the terminal?
2008-05-02T01:01:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	yes... apt has its own log also... /var/log/apt/term.log
2008-05-02T01:01:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	then I'll get that right over to you.
2008-05-02T01:02:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	Appreciated :)
2008-05-02T01:02:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	then I'll get that right over to you. where would the ... part of ...apt normally be? ~?
2008-05-02T01:03:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	The error will be at the bottom... cuz it won't have been able to continue.
2008-05-02T01:03:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	I ran update before. it's updating again, now. the error should be in a log somewhere, AI'm trynig to find where.
2008-05-02T01:09:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	I'll have the error file in about 10, 20 mins.
2008-05-02T01:09:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	I'll be here  :)
2008-05-02T01:09:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	as soon as the upgrade crashes. maybe after apt-get clean, it won't. wish me luck.
2008-05-02T01:19:00.000Z	Hasone	fde	i remember it being stuck at 44% before. it should be about 10-15 more minutes from here on out.
2008-05-02T01:20:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	/msg me when it's done, I don't require updates periodically, I'll still be around  :)
2008-05-02T01:30:00.000Z	fde	Hasone	just select the error portion and copy paste to paste.ubuntu.com
