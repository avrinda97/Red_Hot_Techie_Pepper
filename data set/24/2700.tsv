2008-12-18T10:27:00.000Z	formode		Hello, does anyone know if it's ok to cancel Gparted operations? It is resizing a windows partition I don't really want, if I damage my other partitions?
2008-12-18T10:29:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	if you cancel a partition operation while it's in progress, in all likelihood bad things will happen
2008-12-18T10:30:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	I don't care if it damages my worthless windows partition which it is resizing, but I can't have another damaged.
2008-12-18T10:30:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	why didn't you make a backup before you started messing with partitions, like every guide tells you to?
2008-12-18T10:31:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	and if i recall correctly gparted asks you to make a backup before doing operations as well
2008-12-18T10:31:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	Because I wasn't touching my other partitions, moving my linux partition
2008-12-18T10:31:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	so?
2008-12-18T10:31:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	modifying partitions on disk = backup all important data on the disk or risk losing it
2008-12-18T11:03:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	there is a restricted driver for it available in 8.10.  if you are using 8.04, you'll need to use ndiswrapper
2008-12-18T11:03:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	the problem is, that she doesn't have internet access outside of wifi, and her CD drive is taken by the livecd. :(
2008-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	i already told you the answer to your question.  If she doesn't have wifi she is out of luck.  she needs an internet connection to get it
2008-12-18T11:08:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	would there be a way for her to put the .deb of it somewhere on her computer so she could get it when she was on ubuntu? Last I recall, Ubuntu does not recognize the mac filesystem.
2008-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	ubuntu works with HFS+ fine from what i remember
2008-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	read does at least, unsure about write
2008-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	it wasn't working 3 months ago when I checked. :-/
2008-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	Hm, ok, I'll try that.
2008-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	Thanks.
2008-12-18T11:22:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	because it can't know what is free space and what isn't
2008-12-18T11:23:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	Ah. :-/ That would be a nice feature, it's a clean windows install on a 60 gb partition, so there's like 55 gb of free space.
2008-12-18T11:23:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	it would also probably be longer to rewrite all of the inode tables so that everything could get rewritten correctly and not move free space
2008-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	I kind of want it to just, delete itself now. :-P
2008-12-18T11:27:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	it could
2008-12-18T11:33:00.000Z	fryguy	formode	because you are dealing directly with partition tables, you can't do readahead or anything, so it's going to go slow, for safety's sake
2008-12-18T11:33:00.000Z	formode	fryguy	I understand that. :)
