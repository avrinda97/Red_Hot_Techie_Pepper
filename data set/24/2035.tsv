2009-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	byte^		Hmm.
2009-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	byte^		I'm looking for a project to commit myself to for the summer, as a kind of learning process. I don't think Java would be a good choice to code in because of deficiencies in memory I do not like. I'm willing to dedicate 3-4 months to this, what would be a good language to learn? Is python preferrable? If it matters, I'm looking to code a simple note taking application.
2009-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	byte^		(Yes, I'm aware such exist, I am just looking for a project to mess around with)
2009-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	byte^		I'm just wondering if, for my purposes, if one would be preferrable to another. I have no experience outside Java, keep in mind.
2009-05-15T08:16:00.000Z	byte^		Alright, then I'll definitely look into learning C skills.
2009-05-15T08:16:00.000Z	byte^		And maybe Python since it seems to be brought up so often.
2009-05-15T08:16:00.000Z	byte^		Thanks
2009-05-15T08:17:00.000Z	byte^		K&R?
2009-05-15T08:17:00.000Z	byte^		Neat.
2009-05-15T08:17:00.000Z	byte^		What is K&R?
2009-05-15T08:18:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	Kernighan and Ritchie.
2009-05-18T04:50:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	what about it?  That's just info on the module options.
2009-05-18T04:51:00.000Z	byte^	tritium	I am racking my brain trying to figure out how to get this sound card to work but my knowledge of linux is rather limited
2009-05-18T04:51:00.000Z	byte^	tritium	I think that guide is supposed to get the card working
2009-05-18T04:51:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	you already have that module installed.  "modinfo snd-ca0106" to verify
2009-05-18T04:52:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	are you running jaunty?
2009-05-18T04:52:00.000Z	byte^	tritium	What does that mean? Yes it appears to be installed but where do I go from here?
2009-05-18T04:52:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	see above
2009-05-18T04:53:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	it should work.  First thing -- check volumes, make sure nothing is muted, in alsamixer (command line).
2009-05-18T04:53:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	in alsamixer?
2009-05-18T04:53:00.000Z	byte^	tritium	I posted some information here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7298160#post7298160
2009-05-18T04:54:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	alsamixer is a command line utility.
2009-05-18T04:55:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	no, I mentioned alsamixer *specifically*
2009-05-18T05:10:00.000Z	tritium	byte^	that was unnecessary
