2007-03-23T05:45:00.000Z	phaethon_		can anyone recommend a video card w/ open source drivers thats of comparable performance to a 7600gs, at least for beryl and minimum games like GW via wine?
2007-03-23T05:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	such a beast does not exist
2007-03-23T05:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	intel and early ati cards have open source drivers, the performance is a bit crap though
2007-03-23T05:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	the nouveau project is making open source nvidia drivers, but there is still a long way to go
2007-03-23T05:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	I have i915 as well, it's not too bad, and it will get faster eventually, there is still lots of work being done in non-mainline branches, like native modesetting and that new texture thing
2007-03-23T05:51:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	thx for the help :)
2007-03-23T05:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	I think feisty will have the i915tex driver, which improves performance
2007-03-23T05:52:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	 awesoem :)
2007-03-23T05:53:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	 but for my desktop, theres neither a reason or a card to move to from my 7600gs? thats too bad :( i thought matrox was O/S friendly, though that was many years ago
2007-03-23T05:53:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	I don't think matrox has made a card in years
2007-03-23T05:54:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	its been a while :)
2007-03-23T05:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	intel is the most friendly modern graphics manfacturer
2007-03-23T05:55:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	well my desktop has no onboard video. do they make a pci x video card that'll handle beryl and the occasional game through wine?
2007-03-23T05:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	pci-x or pci express?
2007-03-23T05:56:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	PCI-X
2007-03-23T05:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	your machine doesn't have agp?
2007-03-23T05:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	I don't think anyone makes pci-x graphics cards :S
2007-03-23T05:57:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	pci x only .. its a brand new mobo
2007-03-23T05:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	do you mean pci express?
2007-03-23T05:57:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	apparently so... in the manuel its referred to as pci-x .. whats the diff? :)
2007-03-23T05:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	pci-x is a faster pci slot that is found usually only on server systems, pci-express is something different and is on all modern desktop systems
2007-03-23T05:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	pci express supersedes pci and pci-x
2007-03-23T05:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	phaethon_	intel don't make dedicated graphics cards yet, however there are many rumours that they'll go into the market with one of their latest graphics chipsets, which are supposed to be significantly faster than the i915 stuff
2007-03-23T05:58:00.000Z	phaethon_	dystopianray	well most definitly pci express then.. :) works like a charm w/ my nvidia 7600gs, i'd just like to support  a company that provides a card w/ OS drivers
