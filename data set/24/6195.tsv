2006-06-28T06:40:00.000Z	t4ken		ty
2006-06-28T06:41:00.000Z	t4ken		well wouldnt it be easier for someone like myself to learn from a good teacher or do what you had
2006-06-28T06:41:00.000Z	t4ken		to
2006-06-28T06:42:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	IMVHO, there's only one "good teacher": you, your imagination, experiment
2006-06-28T06:42:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	it's more polite if you ask "informed questions", where "informed" usually implies that u've dun some research/experiments 1st
2006-06-28T06:43:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	I didn't say experiment wasn't dangerous, did I? ;)
2006-06-28T06:43:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	believe me, you'll mess it up some day, even with lots of experience ;)
2006-06-28T06:48:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	didn't follow you from the beginning, what are you trying to mount?
2006-06-28T06:49:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	geez! :-)
2006-06-28T06:49:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	u've wiped the data on that partition for sure, after format :)
2006-06-28T06:49:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and u cannot mount it under linux?
2006-06-28T06:50:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	u have it already :)
2006-06-28T06:50:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and you should be able to do: sudo mount /dev/hdN /mnt_point
2006-06-28T06:51:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	ok, so, let's go a bit back, which kind of disk? where is it connected? which partition?
2006-06-28T06:51:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	kind of disk, something like, 1st IDE ATA drive, on 1st IDE controller
2006-06-28T06:52:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and u know the dev name for it? like /dev/hdX ?
2006-06-28T06:54:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and the commandline you are trying is: sudo mount /dev/hda2 /mnt_point ?
2006-06-28T06:54:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and /mnt_point exists?
2006-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and the commandline you are trying is: sudo mount /dev/hda2 /mnt_point ?
2006-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	and /mnt_point exists?
2006-06-28T06:55:00.000Z	wildman	t4ken	from your messages above I think you are still trying to mount the partition as NTFS... while you said u've formatted it with Ext3...
