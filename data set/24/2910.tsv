2008-06-29T16:43:00.000Z	crm		can anyone recommend a partition for a 650G hdd? (4G mem)
2008-06-29T16:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	a root partition is always handy
2008-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	yes, that sounds safest
2008-06-29T16:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	however windows has difficulty reading it, you need a program to view files from windows
2008-06-29T16:50:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	isn't that just a driver?
2008-06-29T16:50:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	if i can't access the files through windows explorer. then ntfs is the better option for me
2008-06-29T16:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	no windows needs a full blown ext2 fs software
2008-06-29T16:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	ntfs is better if your just storing data and you need to access file sfrom windows and ubuntu
2008-06-29T16:51:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	yea, ntfs is sounding like the better option.. it will be a shared media/file drive
2008-06-29T16:52:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	its not often i say ntfs is better suited but for your needs, it is
2008-06-29T16:54:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	do you have a 64bit processor?
2008-06-29T16:54:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	intel quad 6600
2008-06-29T16:54:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	is that a yes
2008-06-29T16:54:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	yes
2008-06-29T16:56:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	on that note, i want to use the PC as a Media centre.. mainly gaming
2008-06-29T16:56:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	gaming on linux, not likely
2008-06-29T16:56:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	quake 4 works.. right??
2008-06-29T16:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	unless theres major reason an app takes 3gig of ram and you really want to then go ahead, but 32bit is less hassle and you prob wont have any lack of ram probs
2008-06-29T16:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	no idea
2008-06-29T16:57:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	why not?
2008-06-29T16:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	why not what?
2008-06-29T16:58:00.000Z	crm	Bodsda	why no serious gaming on linux?
2008-06-29T16:58:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	because games arent really commercially developed for linux, and although the compatibility layers like wine and cedega are good, they dont meet par with windows on the gaming front
2008-06-29T17:00:00.000Z	Bodsda	crm	oh no, do try and game, just dont get your hopes up with some of the newer games
