2009-02-08T14:14:00.000Z	Naisel	fantomas	I do not like lilo to use once and never understood it
2009-02-08T14:14:00.000Z	fantomas	Naisel	When I run lilo on 8.04 I get message: Added Linux * \n Warning: The initial RAM disk is too big to fit between the kernel and the 15M-16M memory hole.  It will be loaded in the highest memory asthough the configuration file specified "large-memory" and it will be assumed that the BIOS supports memory moves above 16M.
2009-02-08T14:15:00.000Z	fantomas	Naisel	this happens with stock kernel, thats why I worry
2009-02-08T14:15:00.000Z	Naisel	fantomas	could be your bios
2009-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	Naisel	fantomas	you understand the message
2009-02-08T14:18:00.000Z	Naisel	fantomas	You searched for information in the guides ubuntu
2009-02-08T14:19:00.000Z	fantomas	Naisel	jim_p : this message not related to Linux, but to next line which is LinuxOLD, and that one is my custom kernel :)
