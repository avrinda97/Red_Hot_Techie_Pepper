2009-03-22T21:41:00.000Z	Choobie		Hey guys, quick question about device.map
2009-03-22T21:43:00.000Z	Choobie		I have a fd0 in my device.map, anyone know what that is? Perhaps my DVD drive?
2009-03-22T21:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	fd0 = floppy disk 0
2009-03-22T21:43:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	I don't have a floppy drive in my computer...
2009-03-22T21:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	dvd and cdrom drives are usually /dev/sr* or /dev/scd*
2009-03-22T21:44:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	I am getting an error 17 in grub and I think it is because I plugged in a second hard drive after install
2009-03-22T21:44:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	my primary master is my dvd drive, primary slave is the second drive I plugged in, and secondary slave is my OS
2009-03-22T21:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	in that case, either change the number of the second drive, or edit grub's config to use the new number of the old drive
2009-03-22T21:45:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	should I just re-install grub?
2009-03-22T21:45:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	will try that :D
2009-03-22T21:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	if the OS drive was the primary slave, it should probably still be the primary slave
2009-03-22T21:46:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	I am fairly certain that it was always the secondary master, I could check but I would have to shutdown
2009-03-22T21:47:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	I didn't do anything but plug the new harddrive into an empty connector
2009-03-22T21:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	try (hd1,1)
2009-03-22T21:56:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	but it could be hd2 just as easily since I have two hard drives?
2009-03-22T21:57:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	zelda: right now menu.lst shows hd0,0 but it fails to boot
2009-03-22T21:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	if hd0,0 doesn't work, try hd1,0
2009-03-22T21:57:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	ok, will do
2009-03-22T21:57:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	and should I change this is grub.conf as well?
2009-03-22T21:58:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	and what about devices.map?
2009-03-22T21:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	I think so in grub.conf, but I'm not sure about devices.map
2009-03-22T21:58:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	or would a complete reinstall of grub just fix this?
2009-03-22T21:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	Choobie	reinstalling grub likely will not be necessary
2009-03-22T21:59:00.000Z	Choobie	lstarnes	Alright, I will give it a shot
