2008-06-22T16:22:00.000Z	whileimhere		Does running a KDE app on a GNOME desktop slow the system down?
2008-06-22T16:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 not on any decent system. it willload more libs and stuff and take up a bit more ram
2008-06-22T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 i mixx and match kde+gnome apps all the time
2009-09-25T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	  You mean the ubuntu 'usb startup disk creator' tool ?
2009-10-17T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 if they can ping each other.. install ssh and use scp for easy transfers
2009-10-17T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 or set up some mpre perment shares either via nfs, or samba
2009-11-02T22:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 leds flashing on keyboard = a nasty hard crash.    perhaps the cd is bad.  or try partitioning it befor you install via gparted.
2009-11-02T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 on old machines it could be  a bad hd. hard to tell.. partition it exaclty how ya want with gparted as a test I guess.
2009-11-02T22:53:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	I am running the "disc check" on the CD is that reliable?
2009-11-02T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 should be.
2009-11-02T22:54:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	okay I will let that run first.
2009-11-02T22:56:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	okay just running the disk check has caused the same flashing lights and a freeze. Any ideas?
2009-11-02T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 sounds bad..  pc may have some nasty issues.
2009-11-02T23:00:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	Well I ran the RAM check. Man I have never seen so much ram. I just replaced it and am trying it again.
2009-11-02T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 dust out the pc. :) could be overheating also
2009-11-02T23:05:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	it was the RAM.
2009-11-02T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 bam the ram!
2009-11-02T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 ive had ram slots go bad in the past.   can be a real pain to track down
2009-11-02T23:06:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	yep.
2009-11-02T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 whats the specs of the box anyway>
2009-11-02T23:08:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	It is a 800mgh p3 with 3 sticks of 128 ram an onboard 8 meg video card. The  system is going to be totally dedicated to running ADvanced mame
2009-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 you might want to track down a more minimal disrto.  Ive built mame box's in the past also. :) whileimhere  there was a 200mb mini-ubuntu variant i saw taht used some lighter window manager and  stuff.. but i forget its name,
2009-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whileimhere	 ive been playing with TinyCoreLinux lately 10mb :) but i dont think they have a mame package for it.
2009-11-02T23:11:00.000Z	whileimhere	Dr_Willis	I will have to build advmame for this
