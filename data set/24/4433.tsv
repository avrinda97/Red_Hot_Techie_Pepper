2008-02-05T10:00:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	i am trying to make the cd with ubiquity , but i am getting error
2008-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	there are instructions on that page, the first section.  Is there anything specific youre having trouble with?
2008-02-05T10:02:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	which page

2008-02-05T10:03:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	my trouble is "i am not able to make a partition using ubiquity"
2008-02-05T10:04:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	"it means after creating the partition , it is not able to detect the created partition "
2008-02-05T10:04:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	try creating the partition in gparted, before using ubiquity
2008-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	but it is not a good way of creating gparted & then going with ubiquity
2008-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	but it is not a good way of creating partition thro gparted & then going with ubiquity
2008-02-05T10:06:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	When something isnt working, youve gotta try and find a way that works
2008-02-05T10:06:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	i uploaded the error in ubuntu forums also
2008-09-15T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	sudo apt-get remove --purge wine && rm -r ~/.wine
2008-09-15T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	(basically, remove the package, and delete your ~/.wine folder)
2008-09-15T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	Right, You'll ahve to manually edit your menus and remove those
2008-09-15T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	There's an "edit menu" (or something like it) entry somewhere in the menus
2009-01-21T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	Use sudo instead.
2009-01-21T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	what error?
2009-01-21T12:05:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	omitting the directory from where i was copying
2009-01-21T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	That's not a sudo issue then, thats a cp issue.
2009-01-21T12:09:00.000Z	ganesh	Flannel	can you help me with configuring pcap.h header file??
2009-01-21T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	ganesh	Likely not.
