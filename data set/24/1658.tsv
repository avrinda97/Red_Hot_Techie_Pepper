2012-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	isabel		hi, i have trouble connecting Canon LBP 3100 printer to Ubuntu 12.04, can anyone help?
2012-05-19T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	did you check the canon uk website for drivers?
2012-05-19T17:11:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	Yes, i downloaded the drivers and installed it, the printer is a usb printer
2012-05-19T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	when you power it up, does the system react?
2012-05-19T17:13:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	not sure what you mean, but when i turn the printer on nothing happens in ubuntu
2012-05-19T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	ok then in the cog menu, there is a printer app you can use there
2012-05-19T17:15:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	ok
2012-05-19T17:17:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	i deleted the printers i added there, and when turning the printer on it reappears in the Printing app under the cog menu
2012-05-19T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	or you can use the cups web ui (old skool):  http://localhost:631
2012-05-19T17:18:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	is that what you mean the system react?
2012-05-19T17:19:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	Looks like it added itself in there, but when printing a test page it just states "Processing - Sending data to printer."
2012-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	and nothing is printing, is there something i can check somewhere?
2012-05-19T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	remove the printer, then add it manually, specifying the driver
2012-05-19T17:21:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	ok, but there is only a japanese driver for my model not a uk one? can i use the japenese driver?
2012-05-19T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	as long as the driver values are right, sure why not. Have you checked the openprinting database too
2012-05-19T17:24:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	no, where wil i get that?
2012-05-19T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	its a website
2012-05-19T17:24:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	ok, i will google it
2012-05-19T17:26:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	When selecting the driver it select by default this one "Canon LBP3100/LBP3108/LBP3150 CAPT (UK)" , my printer is a LBP 3100, so this one should work?
2012-05-19T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	makes sense, could try the 3000 driver too
2012-05-19T17:27:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	IdleOne: when printing test page, its states "Processing - Sending data to printer." is there not a problem elsewhere? its connected via usb
2012-05-19T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	isabel	did you check the open printing foundation website?
2012-05-19T17:37:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	is there not naybe a issue with sub port?
2012-05-19T17:39:00.000Z	isabel	ActionParsnip	is there not maybe a issue with usb port?
