2009-08-05T05:49:00.000Z	boomerang		i just installed ubuntu 9.04 and it has no sound, how am i supposed to get it to work?
2009-08-05T05:51:00.000Z	boomerang		Can anyone help me with my no sound issue?
2009-08-05T05:51:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Depends.
2009-08-05T05:52:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Do you have the small loudspeaker icon in the upper right corner?
2009-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Then klick on "settings".
2009-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	there are a lot of non-selected channels.
2009-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Then enable _all_ of then. Go back to the sliders and unmute all, then bring all full up.
2009-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	After that you should hear something.
2009-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	im sort of getting lost here, what channels? there;s only one thing there (it says master and its checked)
2009-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	(when playing sound)
2009-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	What device is named in that window? The selection bar.
2009-08-05T05:57:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	it says Null Output (PulseAudio Mixer)
2009-08-05T05:57:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Ah, not good. Any other devices you could choose?
2009-08-05T05:58:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	is also says the also mixer thing but thats for the microphone... (because its detecting the usb device which is my webcam/mic)
2009-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	and the Moniter of Null Output
2009-08-05T05:59:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Okay, seems to be a serious issue. What is your soundcard/chip? Probably onboard?
2009-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	Actually, according to my windows (which is dual booted and sound works perfectly) I have an Envy24 Family Audio
2009-08-05T06:02:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Is it an onboard chip, or a PCI/PCIe card?
2009-08-05T06:03:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	Its a PCI
2009-08-05T06:04:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	Sorry, I don't find anyone mentioning a solution. I fear the chip is not supported yet.
2009-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	really?? ooh that might be bad...
2009-08-05T06:05:00.000Z	mido	boomerang	I only find people complaining about problems not getting this card working, sorry.
2009-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	i was searching earlier on it tho and i entered lspci-v in the terminal (got it from the forums) and it gave me some info on my card
2009-08-05T06:06:00.000Z	boomerang	mido	it said Capabilities: <access denied> im guessing thats bad
