2005-07-12T05:42:00.000Z	budluva		is anyone aware of some good sites for starting programming in ubuntu?
2005-07-12T05:42:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	start by picking a language
2005-07-12T05:43:00.000Z	budluva	cafuego	just pick one out of the hat eh? :P
2005-07-12T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	after you've picked C, get 'The C Programming Language" the book.
2005-07-12T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	If you wants something a bit easier, maybe try PHP.
2005-11-02T15:43:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	If you didn't get errors it worked.
2005-11-02T15:44:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	No, sumply run 'sudo nvidia-glx-config enable'
2005-11-09T12:53:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	Doesn't do anything? The command just exits and prints nothing?
2005-11-09T12:55:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)-nvidia-legacy; sudo nvidia-glx-config enable'
2005-11-09T12:55:00.000Z	budluva	cafuego	EE NVIDIA(0) Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module! EE Aborting! EE Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.....well i have added Load "glx" and removed the dri and GLcore modules from xorg.conf and replaced nv with nvidia, and it wont start, no matter what, if i go back to the "nv" driver x starts, but no glx :(
2005-11-09T12:56:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	need linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)-nvidia-legacy
2005-11-09T12:57:00.000Z	budluva	cafuego	lemme try that...

2005-11-09T13:03:00.000Z	budluva	cafuego	actually, last night about this time i copied some bogus libs to /usr/libs, it was today that i had nvidia problems again :P
2005-11-09T13:04:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	(but really, i was out on site fixing an Win98 machine)
2005-11-09T13:05:00.000Z	budluva	cafuego	by fixing you mean install nix? :P
2005-11-09T13:05:00.000Z	cafuego	budluva	I'm not going there, not with this client.
