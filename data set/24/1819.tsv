2009-08-08T03:08:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	problem with flash.
2009-08-08T03:08:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	what kinda prob? no flash? flash but no play?
2009-08-08T03:09:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	there's some weird play icon in flash videos, and that after clicking it either, it wont play.
2009-08-08T03:09:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	have you reinstalled your plugins?
2009-08-08T03:10:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	Nope, not. there' are only default ones installed - gstreamer , and 1 clouse suggested.
2009-08-08T03:12:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	you will need to get an SWF player then for flash to work. Industry std is Adobe (unfortunately)
2009-08-08T03:13:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	 i already tried what get.adobe.com/xxx recommended.
2009-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	have you tried the alternatives yet? if you go under plugins and hit "Search" you will see 2 others i believe
2009-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	Okay. i ll try
2009-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	i already installed the missing plugins the browser told me to do.
2009-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	man i feel bad for you.. you ahve been here for hours trying to get stuff to work. Cudos on commitment. What kinda machine are we dealing with here?
2009-08-08T03:16:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	the machine works pretty fine.
2009-08-08T03:16:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	if you ask for commitment, i am isolated from 2 years. :)
2009-08-08T03:17:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	well if its any consolation to you, mine still doesnt work right all the time either. I just pound refresh until it behaves again
2009-08-14T18:25:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	GPL	gksu nautlius
2009-08-14T18:26:00.000Z	GPL	b3rz3rk3r	ziroday: didnt work either.
