2005-08-25T12:11:00.000Z	odyssey23		ohh so the disc itself dosnt come with one?
2005-08-25T12:11:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	i doubt it. the wiki and forums are very helpful
2005-08-25T12:17:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	you are getting hoary 5.04 right?
2005-08-25T12:21:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	you can download the iso from ubuntulinux.org. I'm assuming that's what you want to do right?
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	got it. yea they send out free cds. so you don't have it yet?
2005-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	depends on how old it is. if he received it recently it should have hoary 5.04 on it which is what most of us are using
2005-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	5.04 = april 2005 as you might have guessed
2005-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	i think it's just about the easiest linux i've ever used
2005-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	i hope you don't have any modem issues. i had no hardware troubles at all when i installed. everything worked.
2005-08-25T12:26:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	not auto but you can upgrade the whole distro i believe
2005-08-25T12:26:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	understandable. linux isn't always forgiving when things don't work
2005-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	one nice thing is that if you get a hold of the live cd you can test everything before you install
2005-08-25T12:28:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	yea you can boot the cd and it will detect all your hardware. you can go online etc all running from cd. no installation
2005-08-25T12:30:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	it won't be a speed demon but it will work. ubuntu is one cd install so it's not huge
2005-08-25T12:30:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	i haven't tried it on older hardware but so far what i've heard has been positive
2005-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	you mean the extras cd? or packages from apt-get?
2005-08-25T12:37:00.000Z	Gatton	odyssey23	please come back and let us know how it goes!
