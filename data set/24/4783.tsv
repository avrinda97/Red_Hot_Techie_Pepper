2007-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	true true
2007-01-14T06:41:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	its not that uncommon that it doesnt get installed nowadays, very few things still use inted
2007-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	but ktalk was installed and not having a working inetd is a BAD think in that case
2007-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	ktalk implies a kde program, right ? if so, its kubuntu that ist he culprit, as normal ubuntu is only gnome based, but yes, its a broken package imho, and ktalk should have the correct dependencies set for it
2007-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	no I do not think ktalk is part of kde
2007-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	well, i dont have any "ktalk" installed on my ubuntu install
2007-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	so its not installed per default
2007-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	I assure you I would not and did not install any talk daemon
2007-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	just use dpkg-query to find out what package the file belongs to ?
2007-01-14T06:46:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	so what package does the file belong to ?
2007-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	well, something did
2007-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	and it was not any official ubuntu package
2007-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	yeah the installer
2007-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	exactly where is this file ?
2007-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	full path please
2007-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	well, i run ubuntu, and i have a completely empty inetd.conf
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	so its most likely as un_operateur says, somethign added it there, dunno what
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	i bet un_operateur is very awayre of the fact
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	and what do you want him to do about it ?
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	it is a bug in the install process, so is there a place I can report it?
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	first find out if it is the install process that actualy did it
2007-01-14T06:50:00.000Z	pollywog	BULLE	what else could have done it? I am not trying to argue so let's forget it  :)
2007-01-14T06:50:00.000Z	BULLE	pollywog	as no one else seem to have that in their inetd.conf you should first find the bug, no one will do a thing about a bugreport that says "i found something in my inted.conf that i dont think shoudl be there"
