2004-12-07T07:08:00.000Z	king_arthur		just insatlling Warty right now on a x586
2004-12-07T07:09:00.000Z	king_arthur		question any of you guys using a double display setup?
2004-12-07T07:09:00.000Z	Ycros	king_arthur	I am
2004-12-07T07:09:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	was it difficult to setup?
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	king_arthur		it didn't work for me
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	Ycros		mmm, twinview didn't work for me (nvidia card)
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	Ycros		I'm running two separate screens
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	king_arthur		I have pulled out one card and starting again
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	Ycros		without xinerama extensions
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	Ycros		I've never managed to get it working with two separate cards
2004-12-07T07:10:00.000Z	king_arthur		new installation takes about 3/4 hours :-(
2004-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	Ycros		I once had it at the stage where I could switch between both cards, but not have them run simultaneously
2004-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	It should be possible, in theory
2004-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	Ycros		yes, people have done it
2004-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	Ycros		what cards are you doing it with?
2004-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	is there a irc channel for xfree to the best of your knowledge?
2004-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	Ycros		never been in one
2004-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	Ycros		it's probably a scary place. (:
2004-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	one is SiS and one is Trident
2004-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	king_arthur		I agree
2004-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	king_arthur		setting up xfree on my first install 2 years agoo took me about 15 days... :-(
2004-12-07T07:14:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	question: how comes so many ausies online here?
2004-12-07T07:14:00.000Z	Ycros		I don't know, I don't keep count
2004-12-07T07:14:00.000Z	king_arthur	Ycros	makes more sense here in Europe but you have nice weather downunder
