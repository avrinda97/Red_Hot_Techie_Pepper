2005-09-03T07:53:00.000Z	kevogod		RealVNC is better.
2005-09-03T07:53:00.000Z	kevogod		I am just saying that because RealVNC is not open source.
2005-09-03T07:54:00.000Z	kevogod		So it must be better!
2005-09-03T07:55:00.000Z	kevogod		epitak: Exactly!
2005-09-03T07:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	RealVNC is, too, open-source.
2005-09-03T10:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	It's is synced, then that makes sense.
2005-09-03T10:37:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	I know, that's why I said that.
2005-09-03T10:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	If it's in an Ogg container (even e.g. Ogg Flac), he should be fine.
2005-09-03T10:41:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	cdparanoia is nearly as good. :|
2005-09-03T10:47:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	As I understand, EAC and cdparanoia are equally good on most, not-very-scratched discs.
2005-09-03T10:48:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	cdparanoia mainly matches it if you don't use caching
2005-09-03T10:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	What do you mean, "caching"?
2005-09-03T10:56:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	I do not understand... he does not profit from EAC does he?
2005-09-03T10:58:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
2005-09-03T10:58:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	If here to Free it, it could be ported, and more could benefit from his work.  But he hoards his code, to the loss of others.
2005-09-03T10:58:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	He gets postcards!
2005-09-03T10:58:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	Shouldn't that be enough of a reward?
2005-09-03T10:59:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	I'm sure he'd get just as many postcards if more people used his software because it were GPL'd.
2005-09-03T10:59:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	But then it would not be compatible with the GPL.
2005-09-03T10:59:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	He could *request* postcards. :)
2005-09-03T10:59:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	:-)
2005-09-03T11:01:00.000Z	paulproteus	kevogod	I'd say GPL instead - http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/x.html
2005-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	kevogod	paulproteus	I've heard mixed things about it.
