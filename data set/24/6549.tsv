2010-10-20T07:48:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	umm.... yea... the install cd... installs... kinda what it does... upgrades are handled by the various package managers
2010-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	yea but i just want 10.10 not 9.10 and 10.10
2010-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	if you want to upgrade an existing install then open the update manager and click upgrade... the install disk is for... well... installing... not upgrading
2010-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	yeah but i have 9.10 and it gives me the option to upgrade to 10.04 and i want to skip that step
2010-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	you can't
2010-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	you either have to format and do a clean install of 10.10, or upgrade to 10.04 and then upgrade to 10.10
2010-10-20T07:52:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	but ive been able to upgrade with live cd before and now i cant
2010-10-20T07:52:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	no, you haven't... the livecd can only do a new install, it can not upgrade
2010-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	it gave me the option to replace the prvious partition with the new install
2010-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	yes, you can install a new system, replacing the old one
2010-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	no i cant it only gives me the option to have both instead of only 1
2010-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	you need to choose manual partitioning
2010-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	and thats wat i did
2010-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	ive used a cmd from terminal beffore it was something with devel release fo u know that cmd?
2010-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	then it shows you the partition you already have and you need to choose to use it for the root ( / ) and probably format it, though you don't HAVE to
2010-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	so the only way o upgraade to 10.10 without losing my files is upading to 10.04 then 10.10?
2010-10-20T07:59:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	no, you just need to use manual partitioning, and if you don't want to loose your files, don't check the format box
2010-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	and how do i know which is my ubuntu partition?
2010-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	how many partitions do you have?
2010-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	i have 5 partitions
2010-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	eduardo	psusi	but my windows partition doesnt show up on the partition manager
2010-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	psusi	eduardo	can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l in a terminal?
