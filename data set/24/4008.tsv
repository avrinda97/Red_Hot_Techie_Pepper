2007-09-30T16:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	if you want to rename multiple files, have a look at mmv
2007-09-30T16:23:00.000Z	the_bull		[nrx] , yes, they all are same
2007-09-30T16:23:00.000Z	the_bull		[nrx] , mv don`t work
2007-09-30T16:27:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	have a look at mmv
2007-09-30T16:27:00.000Z	the_bull	howlingmadhowie	will mmv work?
2007-09-30T16:27:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	mmv (multiple move) is probably exactly what you are looking for. it allows you to do things like "some file.txt" -> "some_file.text" or whatever
2007-09-30T16:33:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		[nrx] : i used to have a pcmcia gprs card going back 2 years. it worked fine. i just had to set the maximum packet size while configuring the interface.
2007-09-30T16:34:00.000Z	the_bull		kk...
2007-09-30T16:34:00.000Z	the_bull		mmv don`t work for multiple file rename
2007-09-30T16:34:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	mmv "*.ending1" "*.ending2"
2007-09-30T16:35:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	sorry: mmv "*.ending1" "#1.ending2"
2007-09-30T16:35:00.000Z	the_bull	howlingmadhowie	what # means?
2007-09-30T16:36:00.000Z	the_bull	howlingmadhowie	what`s *hash* sign means?
2007-09-30T16:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	just type the sign. it's how mmv knows which argument you mean. for example -> mmv "*.*" "#2.#1" would make out of example.txt txt.example
2007-09-30T16:37:00.000Z	the_bull	howlingmadhowie	thnx bro...it works :)
2007-09-30T16:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	the_bull	no problemo :)
