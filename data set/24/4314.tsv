2007-10-02T10:41:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		Anyone successfully porting gnome-session through ssh -X ? I've got one gutsy one fiesty and one dapper on my lan , open ssh on each and it works great one program at a time but I want to have one machine with a gnome session of the remote machines in another f2 or f12 terminal like mentioned in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=544567&highlight=ssh+gnome-session
2007-10-02T10:43:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		right click on menus and choose edit
2007-10-02T10:44:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		right click on the applications menu that is

2007-10-02T10:45:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		Like http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=544567&highlight=ssh+gnome-session
2007-10-02T10:45:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		you can choose each time you login
2007-10-02T10:46:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		default is the one it launches if you don't choose

2007-10-02T10:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	the Exec line would be ssh -X user@host gnome-session
2007-10-02T10:47:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		Amaranth thank you again !!!
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	make sure you can login to those machines without a password
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	otherwise it will mess up
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		I belive I tried it with  ssh -X user@host gnome-session
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		OK I haven't tried nopass in the config
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	yes but you had a gnome-session already running locally, no?
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		yes
2007-10-02T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	this is making a separate thing you choose when you login
2007-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		I wanted to have one machine at f2 another at f12 and local at f7 is what I am trying to accomplish
2007-10-02T10:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	you could just use vnc
2007-10-02T10:50:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334		Going to try with ssh first. I'll read that link you sent me . Thanks
2007-10-02T10:52:00.000Z	skinnypuppy1334	Amaranth	when you refer to without password do you mean the ssh_config setting ?
2007-10-02T10:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	I mean using public/private keys to do a secure passwordless login
2007-10-02T10:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	http://www.debuntu.org/ssh-key-based-authentication
2007-10-02T10:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	skinnypuppy1334	in this case you can be fine creating a key with no password since it's all on the LAN
