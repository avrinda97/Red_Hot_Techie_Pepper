2010-10-28T02:14:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	it's not enough. may be there is any confing file?
2010-10-28T02:15:00.000Z	danfox		soid: I don't know about config files, what language is your keyboard layout for and is it proven to fully work?
2010-10-28T02:16:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	layouts work correctly. tab switching doesn't work using control+pageup/down
2010-10-28T02:17:00.000Z	danfox		soid: on any particular app or all?
2010-10-28T02:18:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	in gnome-terminal, gedit it doesn't work. but in firefox it's ok
2010-10-28T02:18:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	I think it depends on gnome configuration
2010-10-28T02:19:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	firefox seems to fix it by itself
2010-10-28T02:19:00.000Z	danfox		soid: Yeah, Firefox has separate settings. In that case I can't help you, I'm not fully versed in the way the gnome config files work.
2010-10-28T02:20:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	may be you know what could I do next? debug or something?
2010-10-28T02:21:00.000Z	danfox		soid: just try to get the attention of someone else on here, who knows about gnome config files *shrug*
2010-10-28T02:22:00.000Z	soid_		also it prints "~5" when I press control+pageup
2010-10-28T02:22:00.000Z	danfox		Anyway, back to the task in hand: Hello, I'd like help compiling an open source C++ application which has thus far only been compiled for Windows and Mac, and then hopefully to make a deb of it to share. It has a file 'lpub.qrc' which I think means I have to use qmake, so I have installed qmake and qt4 development files along with g++. I try running 'qmake -project', 'qmake -makefile' and then 'make' but I keep getting error
2010-10-28T02:22:00.000Z	danfox		s during the make. I managed to blunder my way past one make error by commenting out the line it complained about, but now I've run into another for which the solution is a lot less common-sense and a lot more actual know-how, which I lack. Can anyone here help?
2010-10-28T02:22:00.000Z	danfox		soid: have you checked your keyboard shortcuts in System-Preferences? They may be set wrong?
2010-10-28T02:23:00.000Z	soid_		Guys who's here proficient in gnome/X11 config files especially regarding keyboard settings?
2010-10-28T02:23:00.000Z	danfox	sebikul	It's not a dependancy issue I have here, it appears to be internal to the code.
2010-10-28T02:25:00.000Z	danfox	sebikul	I figured that would take too long, if I can get a working version of this within the next day or two it'll be a boon for a project I have upcoming.
2010-10-28T02:26:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	hmmm.. can't find settings regarding tab switching in Keyboard Shortcuts
2010-10-28T02:26:00.000Z	danfox	sebikul	besides, if it's already been compiled for Mac, surely that's close-enough related to Unix and Linux to work with only minor tweaks?
2010-10-28T02:26:00.000Z	danfox		soid: I don't know then.
2010-10-28T02:27:00.000Z	danfox	sebikul	or am I being too optimistic? :-P
2010-10-28T02:27:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	found it in gnome-terminal settings. it's ok
2010-10-28T02:28:00.000Z	soid_	danfox	I've fixed it!!
