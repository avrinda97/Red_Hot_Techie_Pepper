2006-03-02T17:54:00.000Z	roaet		thank you lullabud
2006-03-02T06:08:00.000Z	roaet		my wireless is not finding DHCP, anyone have any clue about that?
2006-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	roaet		I'm having some new issues with my wireless.
2006-03-02T06:09:00.000Z	roaet		It was working yesterday but now it isn't.
2006-03-02T06:10:00.000Z	roaet		I went to network settings and disabled both my wireless and my ethernet.
2006-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	roaet		But the strange thing is, in the ubuntu network settings wizard, I disabled both of my eth* but one is still working.
2006-03-02T06:11:00.000Z	roaet		Anyone have any idea?
2006-03-02T06:13:00.000Z	roaet		Can anyone assist me with my wireless issue =(
2006-03-02T06:13:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	whats the issue ?
2006-03-02T06:15:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	tried any diag, like pinging to see how far you can get, snort to view packets, netstat and so on ?
2006-03-02T06:15:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	I've done just about everything that I can think of but I can't get my wireless to hit DHCP.
2006-03-02T06:15:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	no I can't resolve hosts because it doesn't resolve DHCP from the router.
2006-03-02T06:15:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	its dhcp aye... I take it you did the simple things, like reboot, and take the device all the way down etc
2006-03-02T06:16:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	well I'm not sure how to take the device all the way down. Should I just sudo modprobe -r module?
2006-03-02T06:16:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	is the dhcp serv the ISP's or yours ?
2006-03-02T06:16:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	it is mine, It is working fine.
2006-03-02T06:16:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	no, just ifconfig eth1 down (or whatever) and then dhcpclient or dhcp*whatever to try to get a new lease
2006-03-02T06:17:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	ok let me try that.
2006-03-02T06:17:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	one moment I'll join from my other computer.
2006-03-02T06:17:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	there is also a command to tell the dhcp server to release & give a new one... but you would have to look that up
2006-03-02T06:17:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	also, might try restarting the dhcp box, in case it has a grudge against you :P
2006-03-02T06:18:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	I don't think that is a problem since it's working fine with all the other boxes here.
2006-03-02T06:18:00.000Z	roaet	ipfw	this seems to be a recurring problem with the ipw2100 drivers.
2006-03-02T06:18:00.000Z	ipfw	roaet	oh, might set the timeouts on both boxen higher too, I've had dhcp servers take up to 45sec before :P
