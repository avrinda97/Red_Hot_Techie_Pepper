2005-02-28T07:32:00.000Z	dtygel		question #1: I have an old monitor, and want do set it 800x600. I did it in the configuration of gnome, but the icons are too big. Is there anything to do to make them smaller?
2005-02-28T07:34:00.000Z	dtygel		question#2 (very easy and stupid!) I've just installed ubuntu: i'm using it right now. The install process only asked me a login and password for normal user. What is the default password for the root?
2005-02-28T07:36:00.000Z	dtygel		thank you phreakazoid! so it's the same password as the one I set in the beginning: ok!
2005-02-28T07:37:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	you can get root by doing sudo su but it's rarely needed
2005-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	it won't
2005-03-01T09:00:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	both ?
2005-03-01T09:00:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	and thoreauputic. I'll give it a try then...
2005-03-01T09:00:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	apt-get install aspell ;)
2005-03-01T09:04:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	nevermind :)
2005-03-01T09:04:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	and tritium: it didnt install php4 again!! What a nightmare...
2005-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	I just had to get php5 working
2005-03-01T09:08:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	?
2005-03-01T09:10:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	if you want php
2005-03-01T09:11:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	I'll try it and give the feedback.
2005-03-01T09:13:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	I tried your line, and it just seys that I already have it correctly installed
2005-03-01T09:13:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	then it should be running :)
2005-03-01T09:13:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	could do
2005-03-01T09:14:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	apache is running. But when I type apt-get install php4 it doesn't install it. It says that some dependencies arent installable.
2005-03-01T09:15:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	I'll copy paste it here, with translation to english:
2005-03-01T09:18:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	yes, and also the version of libapache-mod-php4
2005-03-01T09:25:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	do you have any clue on the php4 issue?
2005-03-01T09:25:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	like I said.. I guess see why php4-common can't be installed
2005-03-01T09:27:00.000Z	dtygel	Nermal	forcing didn't work
2005-03-12T10:22:00.000Z	Nermal	dtygel	of course
