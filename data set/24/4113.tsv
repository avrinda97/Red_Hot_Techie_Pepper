2007-09-22T09:01:00.000Z	FFighter		hey folks, I`ve got this new keyboard and it has some keys that have more than 2 chars (4 chars actually)
2007-09-22T09:01:00.000Z	FFighter		How am I supposed to type these other keys, SHIFT in combo with another key plus this key ?
2007-09-22T09:01:00.000Z	FFighter		pretty dumb question but I need to type a pipe char and I cant do it
2007-09-22T09:02:00.000Z	FFighter		ops
2007-09-22T09:02:00.000Z	FFighter		wastrel!
2007-09-22T08:47:00.000Z	FFighter		heya
2007-09-22T08:47:00.000Z	FFighter		all
2007-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	FFighter		my keyboard doesn't have a compatible correspondent layout so I end up by missing some chars
2007-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	FFighter		is there a way to customize the keyboard layout ?
2007-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	rafaelscj	FFighter	system > pref > keyboard
2007-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	yeah, I'm already there... but my keyboard isn't either a 104 nor 102 layout
2007-09-22T08:50:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	it is a genius keyboard but its layout doesn't fit in any of the layouts to choose from this preferences dialog
2007-09-22T08:51:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	it should be an ABNT2 keyboard, but it seems there are some discrepancies
2007-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	FFighter		Is there a place where I could download additional keyboard layouts or something ?
2007-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	FFighter		Or maybe reconfigure the available ones to fit my keyboard ??
2007-09-22T08:52:00.000Z	rafaelscj	FFighter	are you brazilian? what keys don't work?
2007-09-22T08:54:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	yeah :) I'm having a hard time with the backslash key... on my keyboard it is located in the lower left corner (left of shift) but in the Brazil layout it is just above the enter key - the problem is that my enter key is bigger (taller) and the only key above it is backspace
2007-09-22T08:55:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	other than that, in overall the Brazil's layout works fine
2007-09-22T08:55:00.000Z	rafaelscj	FFighter	there is apps for windows that creates layouts, google may help you, is there a key named "Fn"?
2007-09-22T08:57:00.000Z	rafaelscj	FFighter	other question, can you type "~" over "a" or "o"?
2007-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	 
2007-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	 :)
2007-09-22T08:59:00.000Z	FFighter	rafaelscj	I can't see a key named "Fn"
2007-09-22T08:59:00.000Z	rafaelscj	FFighter	I can't to this
