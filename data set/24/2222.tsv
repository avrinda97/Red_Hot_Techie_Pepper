2009-11-05T06:41:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	9.10 is a failure for some people. Use 9.04 if 9.10 is giving you grief. (I have to). And Wait till 10.04 lts comes out.
2009-11-05T07:03:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Are you having Broadcom wifi issues?
2009-11-05T07:03:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	yes.
2009-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php
2009-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	yes i have tried the broadcom site, and i did install there drivers.
2009-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	What Machine is it?
2009-11-05T07:06:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	its a dell latitude D410
2009-11-05T07:06:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	What CPU and chipset does it use?
2009-11-05T07:08:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Ok this may sound wierd............
2009-11-05T07:08:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Does it still have windows on it?
2009-11-05T07:08:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	no, unfortunatly.
2009-11-05T07:11:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Ok. This is what happened to me. My HP2133 would go NUTS when I tried to use wifi under linux. I also had trashed the HD. Only linux there. Anyway I was sure the machine had a Hardware issue (Ran super hot). But wanted a warranty fix. I ordered a HP2133 Windows vista install CD. Installed Windows. everything WORKED again. Me being curious - reinstalled linux and the Broadcom linux drivers. And It's worked sinc
2009-11-05T07:19:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Did you have wifi running on 9.04 (Have you used 9.04 on this lappy before 9.10?)
2009-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Did you have wifi running on 9.04 (Have you used 9.04 on this lappy before 9.10?)
2009-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	yes i have used 9.04 and i had this exact problem, so i updated cos i had read 9.10 has propietry drivers which work. but this is just messing up.
2009-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	What about 8.10 or 8.04?
2009-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	no i have not tried them.
2009-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	Ok. Well I must admit. Im still using 8.10 on my hp2133. And the Broadcom Linux drivers Do work for that. I havn't tried 9.04 or 9.10 on it..... Not sure I want to now!
2009-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	OzFalcon	not sure if reverting to those will fix my problem.
2009-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	8.04 is a bit too old. (Even though it's lts) 8.10 is bareable.
2009-11-05T07:26:00.000Z	OzFalcon	TonyTheTiger	You should just try 8.10 at least.
