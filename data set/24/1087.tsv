2010-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	richardcavell		So 8.04 uses Firefox 3.0b5, according to wikipedia.  Does that mean that 3.0b5 is not known to have any security flaws that are fixed in 3.6.10?
2010-09-24T15:59:00.000Z	richardcavell		*Wikipedia.
2010-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 ignore wikipedia.  its not 100% up-to-date
2010-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 the LTS IS the latest release
2010-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 Maverick isnt released yet
2010-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 and the REASON we don't have the most up to date stuff is because of stability testing
2010-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	richardcavell	EvilPhoenix	Essentially what I'm trying to ask is: Do I upgrade to Maverick or maintain Lucid next month?
2010-09-24T16:02:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 your choice, but the most recently released package versions are not going to be included immediately... they go through stability testing FIRST before the repositories are updated
2010-09-24T16:02:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 i recommend staying with the LTS
2010-09-24T16:02:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 I never upgrade anyways when something is first released.
2010-09-24T16:03:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 i let it exist for a little while first, so that bugs are fixed, issues are addressed
2010-09-24T16:03:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 besides...
2010-09-24T16:03:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 bugfixes are applied in LTS and current builds
2010-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 so having said that
2010-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 updated repos are pushed in 10.04 and Maverick once its released
2010-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 so yeah, enough discussion on whether to upgrade, we can continue that in #ubuntu+1
2010-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 connect to the internet, run Synaptic, hit Reload, then Mark All Upgrades
2010-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 or, in terminal:
2010-09-24T16:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-09-24T16:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 that updates all information about the repositories, and then applies any current package upgrades
2010-09-24T16:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 that will nto upgrade you to the next release, but updates all  your packages.
2010-09-24T16:09:00.000Z	richardcavell	EvilPhoenix	See, Maverick snapshot has Firefox 3.6.10.  Lucid now has 3.6.10.  So what's the crucial difference?
2010-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 between the firefox versions? none
2010-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	richardcavell	 the differences can be explained if you ask in #ubuntu+1
