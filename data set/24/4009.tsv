2007-08-09T09:20:00.000Z	bittis		hey guys, how can i create a startup script in ubuntu that will actually export enviroment variables?
2007-08-09T09:20:00.000Z	bittis		i created a script in the /etc/init.d directory
2007-08-09T09:20:00.000Z	bittis		but doesnt affect anything
2007-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	bittis		but when it comes to starting up it does nothing
2007-08-09T09:22:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	you want to change environment variables for your user?
2007-08-09T09:23:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	i installed java manually, then i wrote an .sh script to export the path to JAVA_HOME and add the bin folder to the PATH
2007-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	ok, you want to change these things for only your user or for everyone?
2007-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	for everyone
2007-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	use /etc/environment ,  but why not use the packaged java and save yourself this trouble?
2007-08-09T09:25:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	i am writting a guide for a package installation and i do not want it to be dependend on apt
2007-08-09T09:35:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	thanks for your help :)
2007-08-09T09:51:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	Does the /etc/enviroment take effect when you are in a shell and sudo -s ? it doesnt appear to be the case, not sure why
2007-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	probably only when you log into the gui, though I'm not sure
2007-08-09T10:03:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	if i edit the .bashrc and say PATH="/usr/local/java/bin:$PATH" would this add that path to the root path?
2007-08-09T10:03:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	what do you mean by "root path"?
2007-08-09T10:04:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	the path for the root account, so that when i sudo i will have /pathtosomewhere available
2007-08-09T10:05:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	ah, maybe if you are changing /root/.bashrc, but sudo does some cleaning up on the PATH when you use it like "sudo command"
2007-08-09T10:06:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	yeah was refering to /root/.bashrc, it seems that it still does not accept the path i set there
2007-08-09T10:08:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	sudo tries to keep the environment secure, and in ubuntu I think the path is when it is compiled
2007-08-09T10:09:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	in other words there is no way of changing that path?
2007-08-09T10:09:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	you can rebuild the package
2007-08-09T10:09:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	I can't really think of a good reason to do so though
2007-08-09T10:11:00.000Z	bittis	jrib	sudo -i solves the problem actually
2007-08-09T10:12:00.000Z	jrib	bittis	ah, so it ends up sourcing .bashrc then?
