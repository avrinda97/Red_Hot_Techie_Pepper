2009-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	look up unetbootin it works on all oses
2009-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	hmm cool i thought it was only windows
2009-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	linux and osx as well
2009-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	the webpage just says windows and linux
2009-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	is there an unofficial build for osx somewhere?
2009-08-04T06:59:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	acoording to apple user osc has that abilty built in
2009-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	hmmm... you mean making a partition bootable?
2009-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	you can just boot the live cd and make one that way
2009-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	its been in ubuntu sence 8.10
2009-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	unfortunately i can't, my cd drive is broken
2009-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	hence the desire to install from a flash drive at all
2009-08-04T07:06:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	wouldent have a windows box
2009-08-04T07:06:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	no... i'm trying to figure out if i can run unetbootin in wine... could be possible
2009-08-04T07:07:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	or under vmware, but i can't make things see my partitions in vmware
2009-08-04T07:07:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	different issue entirely though
2009-08-04T07:07:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	thanks a lot for the help btw
2009-08-04T07:11:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	from what i can find if you formmat the stick as bootable but your missing a syslinux file you gotta get from a windows machine
2009-08-04T07:12:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	formatting a bootable usb stick and copying the iso over should work
2009-08-04T07:12:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	yeah that's what it's looking like... http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1734145&start=15&tstart=0 seems to indicate there's no solution whatsoever to making bootable usb's from mac os x
2009-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	you can make bootable usb from osx its just the syslinux file needs to e changed
2009-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	i'm running unetbootin under wine at the moment, but the text rendering is all kaput so i can't see what the options are
2009-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	flyingtabmow	gogeta	how would i make a bootable usb from os x?
2009-08-04T07:13:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	lol
2009-08-04T07:14:00.000Z	gogeta	flyingtabmow	donno
