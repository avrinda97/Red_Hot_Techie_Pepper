2010-12-18T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	if the keyboard still works press CTRL+ALT+T  and run: dmesg | tail    hard powering off will damage ram and you r HDD so I dont reccommend you do that

2010-12-18T07:10:00.000Z	r0z4	ActionParsnip	but i found this [    1.197774] PM: Resume from disk failed.
2011-02-21T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	i'd boot to live cd and make sure the swap is there and valid, if necessary, recreate it. You may need to change the UID in /etc/fstab for it if the value is different
2011-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	r0z4	ActionParsnip	yes it is
2011-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	r0z4	ActionParsnip	i dont know how to obtain it
2011-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	and is the blkid the same in fstab?
2011-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	sudo blkid    will give the IDs of all available partitions
2011-02-21T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	you can then run: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab   and make sure the value is identical
2011-02-21T03:00:00.000Z	r0z4	ActionParsnip	bklind give a uuid diferent of fstab, i edit fstab?
2011-02-21T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	yes so it matches
2011-02-21T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	r0z4	if the UID doesn't match, then it won't get used
2011-02-21T03:03:00.000Z	r0z4	ActionParsnip	ok, thanks im going to restart for get the results,
