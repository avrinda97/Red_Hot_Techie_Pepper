2008-11-07T00:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger		how do i post the output of lspci and lsusb to .txt? ie lsusb.txt and lspci.txt
2008-11-07T00:05:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	$lspci > lspci.txt
2008-11-07T00:06:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	would cat lspci > lspci.txt do the same thing?
2008-11-07T00:07:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	no
2008-11-07T00:07:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	all you would wind up doing is writing the word lspci into a file lspci.txt
2008-11-07T00:08:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	ok $lspci > lspci.txt in my home dir does nothing, puts a blank .txt file in my home
2008-11-07T00:09:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	is this because im not running lspci as su?
2008-11-07T00:09:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	nm, dont need su for lspci
2008-11-07T00:09:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	$less lspci.txt   does nothing?
2008-11-07T00:10:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	haha nm, $ means at term, my bad
2008-11-07T00:10:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	haha I was about to tell you to remove the $
2008-11-07T00:11:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	i can output any command to a txt with foo > output.txt
2008-11-07T00:11:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	for example uname -r > output.txt\
2008-11-07T00:12:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	yes, and you can target what you output from a command using grep
2008-11-07T00:12:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	so lspci > lspci.txt | grep VGA would output only my nvidia line?
2008-11-07T00:12:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	so say I only want to see ethernet adaptors from lspci,
2008-11-07T00:13:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	no like this, $lspci | grep -i vga > output.txt
2008-11-07T00:14:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	i option ignores everything BUT vga correct?
2008-11-07T00:14:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	no -i ignores case
2008-11-07T00:15:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	type in $grep --help
2008-11-07T00:15:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	it will tell you everyhting there is to know about grep =)
2008-11-07T00:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	man grep im reading...dont know what case distinctions are...?
2008-11-07T00:19:00.000Z	pangloss	billybigrigger	figure it out?
2008-11-07T00:19:00.000Z	billybigrigger	pangloss	yes sir
