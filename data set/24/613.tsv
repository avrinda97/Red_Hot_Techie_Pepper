2011-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	exad		Hello everone
2011-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	exad		I am thinking about putting ubuntu 11.04 on my alienware m11x r2
2011-04-30T06:16:00.000Z	exad		but I have a question
2011-04-30T06:17:00.000Z	exad		My laptop has optimus graphics switching technology
2011-04-30T06:17:00.000Z	exad		is there any way I can disable one of the cards or something since linux doesn't support optimus yet?
2011-04-30T06:17:00.000Z	vivid	exad	you cant use optimus
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	exad		Can I disable any of the video cards though?
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	exad		its not in my bios
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	vivid	exad	if you have an ATI card there are options for it, but you wont need it really
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	exad		it's managed by software
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	exad		its an nvidia card
2011-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	vivid	exad	i have the m15x and i get about 4 hours on battery which should be more than enough
2011-04-30T06:19:00.000Z	vivid	exad	so nvidia = no, you just use the nvidia card and set up power saving when youre on battery, should work fine
2011-04-30T06:19:00.000Z	exad	vivid	I just dont want my 335gt running 247 and heating up my system
2011-04-30T06:20:00.000Z	vivid	exad	when you power up and its on battery, it will automatically go low power, when mine is on battery it does no heating
2011-04-30T06:20:00.000Z	vivid	exad	short story, youll have little trouble with it and you dont need to worry about optimus
2011-04-30T06:20:00.000Z	exad		but it will use the 335gt by default? will it never use the Intel HD graphics?
2011-04-30T06:21:00.000Z	vivid	exad	it will use your nvidia card
2011-04-30T06:21:00.000Z	exad		ok I guess Ill give it a shot then
2011-04-30T06:21:00.000Z	exad		vivid have you tried gaming with wine at all?
2011-04-30T06:21:00.000Z	vivid	exad	i havent tried natty or maverick on my laptop yet so i dunno how theyll act, currently using lucid
2011-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	exad		I see
2011-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	exad		Well I will give it a shot then
2011-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	vivid	exad	yes i get about 60 fps in wow and about the same in tf2 with the gt 240m
