2010-12-14T12:56:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	which java open or sun?
2010-12-14T12:58:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	type java -version to see what java is enabled
2010-12-14T12:58:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	the link above tells how to install sun java
2010-12-14T13:00:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	that is open java
2010-12-14T13:02:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	take some time and read the link, it explains it all
2010-12-14T13:50:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	does javac -version return java 1.6.0_20?
2010-12-14T13:57:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	I believe you need to uninstall the open jre and sdk, you have both it and the sun packages installed
2010-12-14T13:57:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	I am trying to figure out how to clean it up
2010-12-14T14:03:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	post the pastbin location
2010-12-14T14:10:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	working on it
2010-12-14T14:12:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	chose manual
2010-12-14T14:15:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	chose manual on both jvm and jdk
2010-12-14T14:19:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	exit that program, by doing ctlr c
2010-12-14T14:21:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	then exit and reopen your netbeans ide and retry
2010-12-14T14:23:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	hopefully the error will go away
2010-12-14T14:36:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	/usr/bin/java and /usr/bin/javac will still point to the wrong location
2010-12-14T14:42:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	did you chose Run Run Project from the ide?
2010-12-14T14:42:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	did you chose Run Run Main Project from the ide?
2010-12-14T14:54:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	that is the output
2010-12-14T14:57:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	nope look in the middle of this page
2010-12-14T14:58:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	nope look in the middle of this page  http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/netbeans.html#netbeans-2d
2010-12-14T14:59:00.000Z	itaylor57	chandrageetha	the output should look like the middle picture containing the string Hello World
