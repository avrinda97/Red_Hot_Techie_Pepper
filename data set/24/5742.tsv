2007-04-26T05:11:00.000Z	rellik		ever since I upgraded my sound hasn't worked..   it worked fine before the upgrade
2007-04-26T05:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	is it an intel card
2007-04-26T05:12:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	no cmedia
2007-04-26T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	ok
2007-04-26T05:13:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	I have two sound cards though..  could that be causing the problem?  I remember having to go into some program and tell ubuntu which to use as the default card..  but I don't remember what that program was
2009-07-20T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	you have changed the disk layout, do you get the grub menu (first question)
2009-07-20T00:09:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	nope, no grub menu
2009-07-20T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	ok - so what has happened is the partition that your /boot file system is on has been re-orginised due to the new disk, hence why it can't be found to give you the menu
2009-07-20T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	you'll need to re-install grub to the mbr pointing at the correct partition
2009-07-20T00:10:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	it was and still is sdb1
2009-07-20T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	grub doesn't use "sdb1" for references
2009-07-20T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	the OS named disks and how grub names disk are quite different
2009-07-20T00:11:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	yeah, it's using UUID..  which I figured wouldn't change..  but maybe they do?
2009-07-20T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	it's not using a uuid for the mbr
2009-07-20T00:13:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	thanks for the link..  I'll read through that, though it looks identical to the things I've already been trying from other sites
2009-07-20T00:13:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	keep in mind, that to the OS your disks haven't changed, but to the bios your disks have, there is a new one
2009-07-20T00:13:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	that's the key
2009-07-20T00:14:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	I figured at least a full reinstall would fix the issue, by reinstalling and reconfiguring grub
2009-07-20T00:14:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	but I still get it =/
2009-07-20T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	don't need a full re-install, just re-apply grub to the mbr, but this time pointing at the correct partition for /boot
2009-07-20T00:15:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	yeah, but I *did* a full reinstall, and it didn't change anything
2009-07-20T00:15:00.000Z	ikonia	rellik	that's quite possible
2009-07-20T00:42:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	I just tried both the command line and gui repair methods from the page you linked and neither worked.. I'm still getting error 15
2009-07-20T00:44:00.000Z	rellik	ikonia	about the only idea I have left is to physically swap the first two drives, so I can have a blank MBR to try
