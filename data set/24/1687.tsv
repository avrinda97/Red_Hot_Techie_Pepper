2009-10-12T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	ok, but does the mouse work ok?
2009-10-12T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	are you running desktop effects?
2009-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	type actio and press tab to complete my nick
2009-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	cool ;) thanks
2009-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	if you run xev does it react when you click the mouse ?
2009-10-12T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	better :D
2009-10-12T13:03:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	not sure what that is lol
2009-10-12T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	run a gnome terminal (alt+f2, type gnome-terminal, press enter)
2009-10-12T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	you can then see if the system is recieving mouse click correctly
2009-10-12T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	you can always define the mouse in xorg.conf
2009-10-12T13:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	is your mouse fancy or is it just a standard mouse??
2009-10-12T13:05:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	pozic ok, pressing alt+f2 didnt do anything, i know its supposed to pop up with a terminal but nope
2009-10-12T13:06:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	its not fancy, its a 7 button with dpi adjustment
2009-10-12T13:06:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	pozic sorry im kinda nub when it comes to linux ;)
2009-10-12T13:08:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	ive used linux for over two months, always fixed stuff easily with google so i just figured id leave it as is lol
2009-10-12T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	you can define the mouse in xorg.conf to give you control. Here is mine, you may be able to simply add mine (mines a 5 button thing) http://pastebin.com/f18ca94cc
2009-10-12T13:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	if you copy my mouse section then add the identifier to the serverlayout section, you will be able to control and define the mose in xorg.conf
2009-10-12T13:12:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	thanks, ive also tried defining but for some reason x wont take it, probably has something to do with the 32 button thing
2009-10-12T13:12:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	ill take a look at yours, thanks
2009-10-12T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	oroz	its worth a shot, xorg.conf supercedes HAL
2009-10-12T13:16:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	ill copy yours ;) thanks much
2009-10-12T13:20:00.000Z	oroz	ActionParsnip2	sorry, what did you mean by adding layout?
