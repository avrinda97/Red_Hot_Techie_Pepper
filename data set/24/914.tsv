2010-11-10T05:09:00.000Z	RetroGamer		hi guys...hoping you can help, apt isn't working for me...it keeps getting stuck at "waiting for headers" no matter what I try (apt-get update was the last attempt) yet the repo in my sources.list is pinging fine
2010-11-10T05:09:00.000Z	RetroGamer		are my messages actually getting through to the channel?!
2010-11-10T05:10:00.000Z	daftykins	RetroGamer	*crackle* yep
2010-11-10T05:10:00.000Z	daftykins	RetroGamer	pinging from the same PC?
2010-11-10T05:11:00.000Z	RetroGamer	daftykins	indeed...I'm not sure whats wrong with it
2010-11-10T05:11:00.000Z	daftykins	RetroGamer	checked all your settings, network gateway, DNS, proxy? not using a web proxy at all?
2010-11-10T05:12:00.000Z	RetroGamer	daftykins	aye I checked all that...its at this point that I would usually purge the program and reinstall....but its apt ><
2010-11-10T05:13:00.000Z	daftykins	RetroGamer	is it physical or a VM?
2010-11-10T05:13:00.000Z	RetroGamer	daftykins	physical
2010-11-10T05:14:00.000Z	RetroGamer	daftykins	I'm on it now...the internet is otherwise working fine
2010-11-10T05:14:00.000Z	daftykins	RetroGamer	hmm can you wireshark it from another box, or backup sources.list and try another mirror for fun?
2010-11-10T05:14:00.000Z	RetroGamer	daftykins	I have a UNR netbook...does it use the same package store?
