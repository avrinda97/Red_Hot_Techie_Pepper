2007-08-29T11:00:00.000Z	joebob777as7		hey how do i upgrade to gutsy t5 from feisty?
2007-08-29T11:00:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	update-manager -d
2007-08-29T11:01:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	i tried that and it just brings up my update manager completely gray except for the check button and if i click check it goes through  all the repos and then does nothing...
2007-08-29T11:01:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	uhh... that may be a bug... try update-manager -d -c
2007-08-29T11:02:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	and try with sudo, or with gksu
2007-08-29T11:03:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	wait..
2007-08-29T11:04:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	does it give you something in the terminal ?
2007-08-29T11:05:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	what file?
2007-08-29T11:05:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	one second, I gotta search something on my system first
2007-08-29T11:06:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	the meta-release file
2007-08-29T11:06:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	mine was missing something about gutsy, I'll get you the replacement in a second
2007-08-29T11:07:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	this was the bug I had https://bugs.launchpad.net/update-manager/+bug/127263
2007-08-29T11:08:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	it should have info about it there...
2007-08-29T11:11:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	how do i apply the patch?
2007-08-29T11:11:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	that is a good question.
2007-08-29T11:13:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	one second.. that one is actually different from what I used.
2007-08-29T11:15:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	http://paste.ubuntu.com/34/plain/ <--- replace everything in your meta-release file with that and see if it works
2007-08-29T11:17:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	you are a genius! thanx a bunch! i can tell you i've come in here many times to get help and this is the only time i have actually gotten it. thank you!
2007-08-29T11:30:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	during the upgrade process i am now getting... "Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/gutsy/commercial/binary-i386/Packages.gz 404 Not Found"
2007-08-29T11:30:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	hmm, have you tried switching your sources?
2007-08-29T11:30:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	try going system>administration>sources or something like that (I forget what it is in feisty)
2007-08-29T11:30:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	no...
2007-08-29T11:30:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	joebob777as7	and try switching that to the main server
2007-08-29T11:33:00.000Z	joebob777as7	d4rkmonkey	stdin that fixed it. thank you again
