2007-04-14T16:24:00.000Z	cubex		hello everyone
2007-04-14T16:24:00.000Z	cubex		i have a quick question, but i'm afriad it would start a flame-war
2007-04-14T16:25:00.000Z	cubex		wouldn't want that to happen
2007-04-14T16:25:00.000Z	cubex		well, Feisty Server vs. Debian 4.0 ?
2007-04-14T16:25:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	I wouldn't run fiesty as a server it's beta
2007-04-14T16:26:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	yes i know, but it will be released in a week or so
2007-04-14T16:26:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	If anything it would be between 6.06 and debian
2007-04-14T16:26:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	in what sense?
2007-04-14T16:26:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	6.06 is supported long term not just for a few months
2007-04-14T16:27:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	idefix: I agree actually I like debian more for a server
2007-04-14T16:27:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	but why do you like it more for a server?
2007-04-14T16:29:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	It seems to have a smaller memory footprint. At least in my experience. Also, you have more flexablity durning the install as far as what packages are included. Also they are not as fast to include updates
2007-04-14T16:29:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	Everything is very stable when it is released. I
2007-04-14T16:29:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	have you tried any ubuntu server release?
2007-04-14T16:30:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	server updates? or desktop updates?
2007-04-14T16:30:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	Desktop
2007-04-14T16:31:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	I've tried server as well, don't get me wrong it's good I just perfer debain for long term stability on a server. That's just my 2 cents though
2007-04-14T16:32:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	idefix, so the most important advantage of debian is reputation?
2007-04-14T16:34:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	No it's the release cycle. It's much slower to adopt packages for their systems and they take more time to ensure a stable release
2007-04-14T16:34:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	then why would ubuntu have a server release if they can't maintain it and compete with it?
2007-04-14T16:35:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	As far as I understand 6.06 was the first release with long term server support, so basicly they just got into the game. At least that is what I've been able to put together.
2007-04-14T16:36:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	i see
2007-04-14T16:39:00.000Z	clearze1	cubex	You can mirror install and updates with apt btw
2007-04-14T16:40:00.000Z	cubex	clearze1	i know, but that's not enough. i need to be able to test the updates first on a sandbox machine, have it run a few tests, mirror the packages and then inform the rest of the machines that they should get the update
