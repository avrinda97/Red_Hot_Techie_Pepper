2009-08-18T11:20:00.000Z	majuk		Hey guys, DON'T FEED THE TROLLS
2009-08-18T11:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	i eat trolls for breakfast, and its 7:22am here
2009-08-18T11:23:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	Dude, did you get a discount at the Troll-food store? Geez.
2009-08-18T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	i have the patience of a saint
2009-08-18T11:24:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	And the wit of a Saint Bernard. :P
2009-08-18T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	they are usually 13 year old boys whos dads probably beat them so they get their jollies here
2009-08-18T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	i'm pushing 30 so i'm a little more chilled
2009-08-25T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	if its a 4 port switch its hardly going to impact
2009-08-25T12:48:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	I know. Still true. :)
2010-07-01T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	are there any bugs with that text?
2010-07-01T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	what sound card do you use?
2010-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	Bugs? I put a | in the middle to separate the two lines, if that's what you mean
2010-07-01T11:23:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	It's an onboard Intel HD card. Not 100% sure on the model precisely.
2010-07-01T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	sudo lshw -C sound ,will tell you
2010-07-01T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	if its a laptop you may need some options in the sound config to tweak the sound a little
2010-07-01T11:24:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	Negative, desktop, working perfectly up until today
2010-07-01T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	that's all I got. That's what i'd do
2010-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	No, desktop, worked perfectly up until today. Only thing that has changed is the physical location of the machine since it last worked.
2010-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	no updates?
2010-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	Not a one. :\
2010-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	all I can recommend is reboot then run: dmesg | less ,see what's going on
2010-07-01T11:29:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	You're looking at the only change in my messages, that one I supplied you.
2010-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	majuk	yes but you can also look at the rest and see if there are any problems or conflicts. It may just be loose due to the transit
2010-07-01T11:31:00.000Z	majuk	ActionParsnip	It's onboard. No such thing as loose.
