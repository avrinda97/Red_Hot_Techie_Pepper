2005-04-19T11:05:00.000Z	fissy		Does anyone know of a services manager for ubuntu?
2005-04-19T11:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	there really isn't one atm :(
2005-04-19T11:07:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	I guessed :( just asking in hope. The present system really really sucks - why do ubuntu take the services-admin program out of gnome-system-tools? its supposed to work with debian systems isn't it?
2005-04-19T11:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	the devs don't fine them stable enough
2005-04-19T11:10:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	worked fine for me. So their rationale is take out potentially buggy functionality in favour of *no* functionality
2005-04-19T11:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	well there are things planned like a services manager, menu editor for future release but aren't ready yet
2005-04-19T11:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	you can use update-rc.d to manage services (for the most part).
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	i thought ubuntu had  a philosophy of not making software themselves? the new menu editor is a gnome project, just like the existing services manager
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	i read on the ubuntu wiki that you shouldn't use that, its only for dpkg's use
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	sorry make that runlevel editors
2005-04-19T11:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	yeah I know but it's that or 1) uninstall the service 2) manually edit the symlinks in the /etc/ rcX dirs
2005-04-19T11:14:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	Surely someone who could code could make a gtk app to do that in a day, seems madness its been left like this
2005-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	worse case scenario (using update-rc.d) is that the service will get started again if there is an upgrade for the service itself.
2005-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	fair enough
2005-04-19T11:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	the devs are so busy and there are some issues with how the package manager interacts with runlevel administration, I guess it's quite a kluge right now.
2005-04-19T11:18:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	well if they want to hire someone who can code gtk# ;-)
2005-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	I was hoping to start a project to address it but I got the impression that there were many underlying issues that had to be worked out. That was enough to scare me away like a prissy schoolgirl :)
2005-04-19T11:21:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	is it possible to put a noexecute line in the /etc/init.d/script and have that managed by some gui program? It wouldn't interfere with the package manager but should work?
2005-04-19T11:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	I don't know offhand, might be worth asking in #ubuntu-devel about it.
2005-08-25T16:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	hit alt + F2 and see if it comes up
2005-08-25T16:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	maybe it got moved  somewhere else
2005-08-25T06:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	your right
2005-08-25T06:38:00.000Z	fissy	LinuxJones	:) I don't quite understand why though.. other systems manage with just the one port
2005-08-25T06:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	fissy	it's an old protocol
