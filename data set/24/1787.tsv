2010-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	yes
2010-08-04T07:55:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	Normally, yes
2010-08-04T07:55:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	even when the main os is stored on /dev/sdb?
2010-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	it depends on how the disks were at the installation and which options were set. You can install Grub to any disk you want with a live cd rather easily though
2010-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	i just left it at the defaut values, with the exception of installing to /dev/sdb
2010-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	So I'm guessing you want to find out where the bootloader is?
2010-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	im tring to figure out if i need to mess wiht my BIOS, /dev/sdb went in first, and is the one i want to use for OS
2010-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	Normally its stored on the first hard disk (sda) because thats where the BIOS would boot from first in most cases
2010-08-04T08:00:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	What is sda used for?
2010-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	heree a bhasic time line for you, PC gets built, 200 gig hardrive gets full, add a 1.5 terabyte hdd, *nix maps it as /dev/sda for no reason i can figure.
2010-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	It gets mapped that way because of which Sata controller you have it plugged into
2010-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	figured that much, bios has been set to boot from /dev/sdb though, so i just nee to switch
2010-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	sda is the first one it detects
2010-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	So the OS is on the 200 GB?
2010-08-04T08:04:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	and the 1.5 TB didn't exist when the OS was installed?
2010-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	not initaly and survived 2 reinstalls of windows.
2010-08-04T08:06:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	I/m assuming after these windows re-installs you had to re-install Grub manually
2010-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	it just got religated from desktop to home server, so now installing ubuntu, and getting winxp boot loader error messages
2010-08-04T08:08:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	I didn't quite understand your last message
2010-08-04T08:09:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	it was as of about 2 days ago, my main PC, how ever sence i got a new one, the position of the PC in question got changed to "home server" and as part of the jop change it gets ubuntu installed,  *looks at sentence* taht loook clearer to you, or is my horrible grammer getting to me?
2010-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	It wasn't grammar or anything. Just wasn't sure what you meant exactly. Does it boot as is right now?
2010-08-04T08:12:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	no, because it tries to go to a nonexitant windows install. probably go away if i switch boot order in BIOS settinggs now that i think about it.
2010-08-04T08:13:00.000Z	matrixblue	kisuke	I agree
2010-08-04T08:13:00.000Z	kisuke	matrixblue	kk thanksa
