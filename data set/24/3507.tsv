2008-01-16T08:29:00.000Z	ManicMechE		I'm trying to install ubuntu on my G4 laptop, but I can't get it to boot from the install cd - help?
2008-01-16T08:30:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	yeah Ive done a couple of these
2008-01-16T08:30:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	I think after rebooting you'll need to hold down ctrl-c
2008-01-16T08:32:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	and depending on the install it may in fact take a bit after you see a white screen to see the desktop..and it will appear to run slowly...however once you do the install it responds fine
2008-01-16T08:32:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	Also I had issues with 7.10 and had to revert back to Dapper
2008-01-16T08:33:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	typically one holds down just C to boot from cd, but that doees not work. I also tried holding option, which allows you to select your boot disk, but that did not work either.  I even tried cmd-opt-shift-delete which is supposed to force to boot from the cd drive even if the disk doesn't appear bootable, but that does not work either.  it all just boots it to the osx login screen.
2008-01-16T08:35:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	yeah..I hear you with those gosh darn combination to get it to boot keys. At one point or another I remember CTRL-C....
2008-01-16T08:36:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	you will then get a bootloader prompt and then go from there...
2008-01-16T08:36:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	you should then see the "white screen of life"...lol
2008-01-16T08:38:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	neither ctrl-C nor cmd-C on boot did anything
2008-01-16T08:40:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	I ht8 to ask but you have verified that the media is bootable right??
2008-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	er, good question...I'm not sure how to do that
2008-01-16T08:45:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	Id say...ermmm...maybe open it up on another box...and see if you can see the bootloader files??
2008-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	yes, it does appear to be bootable
2008-01-16T08:53:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	id say a little hunting on the internet...there are so many of those different combos.. so are you rebooting the box, and immediately after you hear the apple "dong" holding down ctrl-c or whatever??
2008-01-16T08:58:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	I think there may just be a problem with my cd drive?  it's being very stubborn about booting from any CD, I can only boot from the Leopard disc by holding option and selecting it.
2008-01-16T08:59:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	you could do this..maybe? - plug in another drive to the ide, supply power, boot, and then try...once installed...uninstall the new drive??
2008-01-16T09:01:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	unfortunately I don't have a spare lying around that might fit.  trying an external drive...
2008-01-16T09:02:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	oh cool..so that is off of USB..what combo keys do you use for that..or does the system just know to boot off that..??
2008-01-16T09:07:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	it's an 1eee 1394 drive.  same key combos apply, but I'm still unable to boot from the install cd.
2008-01-16T09:08:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	maybe reburn that CD??
2008-01-16T09:18:00.000Z	ManicMechE	achandrashekar	burned and verified again, still not booting.  md5 checks out too.  I think it might just be time for a new laptop.  I've used this thing just about every day for the past five years, four of them carrying it around at college, and it's falling apart.
2008-01-16T09:18:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	Ive never done this...but having enough of a boot.img to boot off of net?? on ppc?? ive never done it but..last option??
2008-01-16T09:19:00.000Z	achandrashekar	ManicMechE	and then literally put it on a usb??
