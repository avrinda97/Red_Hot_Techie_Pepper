2006-01-02T13:55:00.000Z	zanth		good day, I just installed ubuntu for the first time and was wondering how I might adjust my refresh rate, presently it only permits 60 as an option, I would like 85
2006-01-02T13:55:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	what vga do you use?
2006-01-02T13:56:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	no, VGA card (ATI? Nvidia? type?)
2006-01-02T13:57:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	Nvidia 6800Gt pci-x
2006-01-02T13:58:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	do this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia?highlight=%28nvidia%29
2006-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	np :)
2006-01-02T14:04:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	I am not at the last part where I am to choose the type of linux-restricted-modules, I am running an AMD x2 4400+, which should I choose?
2006-01-02T14:05:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	use the linux-restricted-modules-k7-smp
2006-01-02T14:05:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	and install linux-image-k7-smp too!!
2006-01-02T14:06:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	what is the difference between k8 and k8-smp?
2006-01-02T14:06:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	smp is for dualcores/dual CPU's
2006-01-02T14:06:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	like you have ;)
2006-01-02T14:09:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	np. Reboot after completion
2006-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	i don't seem to have any other options, I am still resting with 60Hz as the only refresh available
2006-01-02T14:17:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	what does "glxinfo | grep direct" say (in a terminal)
2006-01-02T14:18:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	it returns "Yes"
2006-01-02T14:19:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	good. check if your hsync and vsync are correct in /etc/X11/xorg.conf (in terminal: "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf)
2006-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	its somewhere in the middle
2006-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	I think this is the problem
2006-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	because?
2006-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	be right back
2006-01-02T14:21:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	I guess when I installed the OS I went with generic and thus it just set generic ? not sure, I was only provided with the option of going what res, not what refresh
2006-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	zAo^	zanth	you see the section "screen" in the file?
2006-01-02T15:02:00.000Z	zanth	zAo^	thanks a lot for your help, I accidently edited the a line and then didn't edit the refernece to it in screen, but I was able to fix it all up, and now things work very well, my eyes thank you
