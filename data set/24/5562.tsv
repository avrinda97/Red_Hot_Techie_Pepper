2007-02-06T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	that's ambiguous, did you use checkinstall or make install?
2007-02-06T07:32:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	make install, as I didn't understand the checkinstall bit
2007-02-06T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	you can try 'sudo make uninstall' in the same place you ran the command 'sudo make install'  but there are no guarantess that an uninstall rule exists
2007-02-06T07:34:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	so I would type "sudo checkinstall", rather than "sudo make install" ?
2007-02-06T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	yeah
2007-02-24T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	alt-f7
2007-03-17T10:36:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	yeah, just change the shortcuts to call  gnome-terminal --geometry=GEOMETRY
2007-03-17T10:37:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	what format is GEOMETRY in?
2007-03-17T10:38:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	man X, but basically: WIDTHxHEIGHT will do what you want
2007-05-02T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	you can use pdftk
2007-05-02T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	the examples section of the man page handles that exact situation.  I thought the syntax was a bit cryptic the first time I used it, so be sure to check that
2007-05-02T05:54:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	this is so perfect..  :P   Saves me alot of time!
2007-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	system -> administration -> login window -> accessibility
2010-10-31T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	what is your real question?
2010-10-31T02:35:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	that's it
2010-10-31T02:36:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	doesn't upstart still use the rc2.d directory, or has that changed?
2010-10-31T02:36:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	for backwards compatibility, sure
2010-10-31T02:37:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	what version of ubuntu?
2010-10-31T02:37:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	10.10
2010-10-31T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	Steve^	/etc/init/mysql.conf (upstart)
2010-10-31T02:38:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	excellent, thanks
2012-09-12T02:06:00.000Z	Steve^	jrib	Kamilion_ well it must be a PATH problem from inside the script? As the cron line is an absolute path?
