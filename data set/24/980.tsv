2011-04-28T16:35:00.000Z	eltigre		Hey, I am having trouble with defective packages
2011-04-28T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	you have to be more specific
2011-04-28T16:36:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	So far I am only getting messages that I have to repair them
2011-04-28T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	messages where?
2011-04-28T16:37:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	synaptic and apt-get
2011-04-28T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	and what's the exact message you receive from apt-get?
2011-04-28T16:39:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	I only have the German version, but roughly: aborting due to problems in pkgProblemResolver::Resolve
2011-04-28T16:39:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	you're trying to upgrade?
2011-04-28T16:39:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	not really
2011-04-28T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	prefix your command with "LANG=C" and pastebin
2011-04-28T16:41:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	hm it's about python packages... wait a moment
2011-04-28T16:42:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	http://pastebin.com/jqReU10t
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	« apt-cache policy python »  Where did this strange python version come from?
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	I have no idea
2011-04-28T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	what does that command return?
2011-04-28T16:44:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	http://dpaste.com/536729/
2011-04-28T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	you have to figure out where that unofficial version of python came from and downgrade back to the official ubuntu version
2011-04-28T16:46:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	I have a few ppas...
2011-04-28T16:48:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	downgrading would basically deinstall most of the software I use, like firefox and gimp
2011-04-28T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	you need to remove that unofficial version of python
2011-04-28T16:53:00.000Z	eltigre	jrib	hm... another stupid question, I tried to do that with synaptic but I can't actually perform the action because it says I have to repair defective packages
2012-04-27T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	please don't make general statements like that that are not true
2012-04-27T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	that gets you the wrong kind of attention...
2012-04-27T19:30:00.000Z	jrib	eltigre	please just stick to support
