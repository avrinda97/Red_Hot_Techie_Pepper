2006-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	sess		pretty much the ultimate convergence devic,e
2006-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	yacc	sess	basically something slighty more powerfull than a Nokia9500 ;)
2006-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	sess	yacc	way more powerful than the communicator
2006-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	sess	yacc	the communicators are pitiful, although i gotta say im a big fan of series 60 and series 80 symbian os
2006-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	yacc	sess	Well, they give WLAN/GPRS, a survivable keyboard and ssh, that's an ok combo for me :)
2006-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	yacc	sess	display is 640x200?
2006-09-20T14:08:00.000Z	sess	yacc	I have a universal, wifi, bluetooth, full keyboard (almost touch type size) and full vga display.  GPRS and UMTS as well as 3G support
2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	yacc	sess	9300i seems the nicest one in the collection.
2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	sess	yacc	I completely agree
2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	yacc	sess	universal?
2006-09-20T14:10:00.000Z	yacc	sess	Oh, well, before I go the Windows route, I'll prefer a Psion every time ;)
2006-09-20T14:10:00.000Z	yacc	sess	it's not epoc3 but still ;)
2006-09-20T14:11:00.000Z	sess	yacc	I love the symbian os, I used to own the psion mx, I think was running epoch3.  Symbian is the only truely multitasking mobile OS
2006-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	yacc	sess	Just got my 9500 yesterday in the mail :)
2006-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	sess	yacc	well, its still a nice device, I would take that over startac anyday ;)
2006-09-20T14:14:00.000Z	yacc	sess	that's not funny, that means, I need to make my laptop a router for an IP that is in the same range as the WLAN net :(
2006-09-20T14:15:00.000Z	sess	yacc	why? laptop is running windows?  internet connection sharing, adhoc address can be anything, as long as its set as the gateway on your nokia
2006-09-20T14:16:00.000Z	yacc	sess	nope the laptop has only Linux on it, but still, "routing" packages that come in on eth2, back out on eth2, while it still the same IP network, ...
