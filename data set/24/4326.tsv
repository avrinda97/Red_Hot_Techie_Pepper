2007-05-12T07:54:00.000Z	Fezzler		I just installed nVidia GeForce 5500 AGP.  I'm a real newbie.  Found instruction on how to load nvidia.  But how can I check if I have the right drivers for the 5500 installed?
2007-05-12T07:55:00.000Z	Fezzler		call me Fez:  I want to make sure I installed correctly before I play with Beryl
2007-05-12T07:56:00.000Z	Fezzler		Are all Ubuntu nvidia drivers one and the same?
2007-05-12T07:57:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	no, there are three of them. Restricted Drivers Manager should automatically detect what you need.
2007-05-12T07:59:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	So if my new graphics card is working and Restricted Driver Manager appears in my System>Administration menu, I installed it correctly
2007-05-12T07:59:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	whether it appears has nothing to do with it
2007-05-12T08:00:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	 Well, I have a monitor working off the new card.  The Restricted DM say nvidia accelerated installed, so again, how do I know if I installed the right driver?
2007-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	try running a 3d program like a screensaver and see if that works
2007-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	Yea, screensavers work (but they worked with my on-board graphics card too, so does that prove anything?)
2007-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	just trying to learn
2007-05-12T08:03:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	I'm not sure then...
2007-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	you should wait a few minutes (5-10)
2007-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	Thanks.  Will do.  I just want to make sure I have right nvidia driver installed before I install Beyrl
2007-05-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	System>Preferences>Desktop Effects
2007-05-12T08:07:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	done.  how do I test it (see app in cube?)
2007-05-12T08:07:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	switch desktops or ctrl-alt-drag
2007-05-12T08:10:00.000Z	Fezzler	cables	 no cube  :(
2007-05-12T09:16:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	no, it's just that fewer people are in there
2007-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	it's not really that oftopic, and that's a bug, not a feature.
2007-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	there's a way to fix that bug, but I'm not sure how... people in ubuntu-effects will know, if they're there.
2007-05-12T09:19:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	also try #beryl
2007-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	no, there is a way to fix it!
2007-05-12T09:20:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	just go to #ubuntu-effects and ask, and hopefully they'll tell you.
2007-05-23T10:15:00.000Z	cables	Fezzler	use sudo -i
