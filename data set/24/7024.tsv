2006-11-16T08:44:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	what about just deleting the .gnome and .gnome2 directories from my profile?
2006-11-16T08:39:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Try to create a new user on the console and login with a gnome session. <ctrl><alt><f1>login ... then sudo adduser gnometest ...  then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart && exit
2006-11-16T08:40:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	thanks, I'll try that.
2006-11-16T08:40:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	If this works you can rename your /home directory and login with a clean gnome session.
2006-11-16T08:41:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	would I then copy everything back again to the "new" home directory afterwards?
2006-11-16T08:43:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Well you can copy your files and some of your .conf directories like .mozilla or so. But not the .gnome .gnome2 directories ;)
2006-11-16T08:44:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Normally ... yes.
2006-11-16T08:44:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	or my home directory at least...
2006-11-16T08:44:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	these are not the only possibilities for your problem ;)
2006-11-16T08:45:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	I would rather rename your /home/yourname directory to /home/yourname-old ... then create a new directory /home/yourname ;)
2006-11-16T08:45:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	true. call me lazy, but the idea of copying across all the .config directories is not driving me wild ;)
2006-11-16T08:47:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Do what you want. My experience shows, that to start with a clean home directory is sometimes a quiet good idea...
2006-11-16T08:48:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	thanks for the suggestions; I'll probably end up going for the clean start
2006-11-16T08:48:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	np
2006-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	This is strange ...
2006-11-16T09:03:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	I agree!
2006-11-16T09:04:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Try to install a light wm ... sudo apt-get install fluxbox and then try to login with the fluxbox session.
2006-11-16T09:06:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	I've been wanting to try xfce for a while, so installing that...
2006-11-16T09:07:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Xfce uses gtk too and maybe won't work either... Fluxbox will not take you a lot of space ;)
2006-11-16T09:08:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	I see :\. It's already downloading, so I'll let it finish first
2006-11-16T09:08:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	ok
2006-11-16T09:09:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	I am taking a short break . Will be back in 20 minutes ...
2006-11-16T09:10:00.000Z	ndlovu	minimec	np, I appreciate the suggestions
2006-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	minimec	ndlovu	Some news? ;)
