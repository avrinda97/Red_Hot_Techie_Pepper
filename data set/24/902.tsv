2010-11-06T08:47:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		will installing ubuntu-netbook package on my desktop installation add all the netbook settings?
2010-11-06T08:48:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		also if i make changes to the settings on a live usb stick, if i then install ubuntu to the actual hard disk will my custom settings on the stick be transfered???
2010-11-06T08:50:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		will installing the ubuntu-netbook package on my desktop installation add all the netbook settings? anyone who wants to help?
2010-11-06T08:51:00.000Z	b0nn	nibblerofdoomz	what netbook settings are you talking about?
2010-11-06T08:53:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		bonn: i want to install unity, the applets that come on the desktop and all that jazz that comes with netbook edition. i essentially want to switch from desktop to netbook without a reinstall, because i need some other tweaks that the desktop version has done which ican't do, as well as non-standard packages it has added already
2010-11-06T08:54:00.000Z	b0nn	nibblerofdoomz	heh, I'm here because my nbr upgrade didn't go so well, ... but... unity is just another desktop environment, it's the same as having gnome, kde, or enlightenment installed
2010-11-06T08:55:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		really, i am hoping when i install ubuntu-netbook that everything will just work
2010-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		bonn: i already tried it once and ended up losing the taskbar on my usb flash disk that i am running it from atm for testing.
2010-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		will have to try reinstalling the desktop edition to usb disk - AGAIN. then adding the ubuntu-netbook package and praying lol
2010-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	b0nn	nibblerofdoomz	as I say, I'm here because of problems with unity as it is
2010-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		unity rules. what's wrong with it bonn?
2010-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	b0nn		it's broken on my netbook
2010-11-06T08:59:00.000Z	b0nn		It was working /fine/ on lucid, I upgraded 3 days ago, and it died
2010-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		so what can/can't you see?
2010-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		what are your symptoms of it being borked
2010-11-06T09:01:00.000Z	b0nn		hold up
2010-11-06T09:01:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		hi vinus put ubuntu on a DVD and run it, be brave.
2010-11-06T09:01:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		oh wait soz i misread
2010-11-06T09:02:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		you'll need a book disk or a boot stick (usb) that you can use to reinstall grub
2010-11-06T09:03:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		also i am not sure if Windows can non destructively resize a linux partition so you should probably create it in gparted
2010-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	b0nn	nibblerofdoomz	when I try to start a unity session I get the background image ( one I created), and that's it. I have to hard reboot to get to login and switch to Desktop
2010-11-06T09:10:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz	b0nn	hmm. That's pretty much my problem
2010-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	nibblerofdoomz		after trying to fiddle with the desktop to get unity all i get is the background
2010-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	b0nn	nibblerofdoomz	it works great on lucid :)
