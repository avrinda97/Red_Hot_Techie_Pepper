2007-05-22T11:52:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr		how do i get a program to start on bootup?
2007-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr		boot
2007-05-22T11:53:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	add it to session start up
2007-05-22T11:54:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	yes under System-->sessions
2007-05-22T11:55:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	you will need to edit fstab possibly
2007-05-22T11:59:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	fstab is hooked to grub
2007-05-22T11:59:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr	shane634	fstab is just mountung the file systems
2007-05-22T12:00:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	pastebin a dmes log perhaps
2007-05-22T12:00:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	dmesg
2007-05-22T12:13:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	is it that hard to start upon boot?
2007-05-22T12:13:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	no that is startup execution
2007-05-22T12:17:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	why not?
2007-05-22T12:17:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	they are startup programs lol
2007-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr	shane634	so no one has answered the question, how to get a program to start on bootup
2007-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	add it to startup in session manager
2007-05-22T12:19:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr	shane634	have you been paying attention? i just did that, and rebooted, and tried to login remotely, and nooooooo dice!
2007-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	your remote settings are not spot on then
2007-05-22T12:20:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr	shane634	after i log in to the server, they work just fine. try again.
2007-05-22T12:21:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	after..put that in front of the login command perhaps
2007-05-22T12:22:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	you realize these commands are complex correct?  allow for such in the startup
2007-05-22T12:22:00.000Z	dbrewer_rjr	shane634	the command is : vncserver
2007-05-22T12:22:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	i am no server wiz but it is simple
2007-05-22T12:23:00.000Z	shane634	dbrewer_rjr	put it in startup and reboot that is the answer
