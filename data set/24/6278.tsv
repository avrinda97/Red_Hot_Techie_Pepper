2006-08-17T08:37:00.000Z	nba	sethk	type sudo chmod 777 03. ASIN
2006-08-17T08:34:00.000Z	sethk	nba	use sudo
2006-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	nba	sethk	i just did but nothing work
2006-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	nba	then it didn't fail because of permissions
2006-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	nba	sethk	what shud i do then
2006-08-17T08:36:00.000Z	sethk	nba	start by giving us the exact error
2006-08-17T08:36:00.000Z	nba	sethk	i type Desktop
2006-08-17T08:37:00.000Z	sethk	nba	what is that?  type sudo chmod 777 03.  ASIN?
2006-08-17T08:38:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 error says "cannot access '03.ASIN': No such file or directory
2006-08-17T08:38:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 03. ASIN is the file name i want to move
2006-08-17T08:38:00.000Z	sethk	nba	probably the file is not in the current directory.  try using the full path name
2006-08-17T08:39:00.000Z	sethk	nba	also, to handle what Number_5 is asking, use tab completion
2006-08-17T08:39:00.000Z	sethk	nba	that will get the backslash where it is needed
2006-08-17T08:44:00.000Z	nba	sethk	if i use the full path name, does it look like this: /home/nba/Desktop/03. Asin
2006-08-17T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	nba	if it is in /home/nba/Desktop, it might.  You keep typing it differently.  last time you type ASIN, this time you typed Asin, and the space, I'm not sure about.
2006-08-17T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	nba	that's why I suggested that you type in the first letter or two and press tab.  let the shell complete the name for you.
2006-08-17T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	nba	that's less typing, and is guaranteed to be in the correct format for a shell command.
2006-08-17T08:45:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 ok i'll try it again
2006-08-17T08:46:00.000Z	sethk	nba	I'm not being critical, just extolling the benefits of tab completion.
2006-08-17T08:53:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 ok guys i'm in
2006-08-17T08:54:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 yes, its unlocked already
2006-08-17T08:54:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 so i can moved it now?
2006-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 yes! it worked, thanks a lot!
2006-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	nba	sethk	 ur a great help. have a nice day guys!
