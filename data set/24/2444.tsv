2008-12-12T02:44:00.000Z	Cybolic		Hi all, I just upgraded ntfs-3g and now I can't write to my ntfs partitions even though they should be mounted correctly. Debug info is here http://paste.ubuntu.com/84111/ - please help. I cam usually fix my own problems but this makes no sense to me.
2008-12-12T02:45:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	Were you able to write to your partitions prior to upgrading?
2008-12-12T02:46:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Yes, I was.
2008-12-12T02:46:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	I don't know what version I upgraded _from_ though.
2008-12-12T02:47:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	It says on line 12 it's mounted as rw
2008-12-12T02:48:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Exactly, that's what I don't get. When I try to write to the partition (as with the touch command) it says it _isn't_ mounted rw.
2008-12-12T02:48:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	how are you mounting it? In fstab?
2008-12-12T02:48:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Yes.
2008-12-12T02:49:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	could you pastebin your fstab file?
2008-12-12T02:49:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	I'll paste you the line: UUID=1A81229A5F8AF86E /media/storage  ntfs    defaults,umask=0002,uid=1000,gid=100 0 1
2008-12-12T02:50:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	Do you need any special mounting options? Or are the defaults fine?
2008-12-12T02:50:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	I'm not sure what you mean?
2008-12-12T02:52:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	Alright, that answers my question anyway. Are you running Intrepid?
2008-12-12T02:53:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Actually I'm running Mint, but it's based on Hardy and uses its repos.
2008-12-12T02:53:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	The ntfs-3g package was also from hardy repos.
2008-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	OK, sure! Here's a graphical config program: sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
2008-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Thanks, I'll try that :)
2008-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	And thank you for your time.
2008-12-12T02:55:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	No problem! I'm just giving back after all the help I've received here. Check out this for more: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions/ThirdPartyNTFS3G
2008-12-12T02:55:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	Launch that via gksudo ntfs-config and check the boxes :P
2008-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Don't worry, I got it ;)
2008-12-12T02:58:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	Wow, that thing rewrites the _entire_ fstab file... kind of scary, but it seems to have preserved the options of other partitions, so no worry, just a quick scare.
2008-12-12T02:58:00.000Z	Cybolic	aeolien	It works now - thank you again.
2008-12-12T02:59:00.000Z	aeolien	Cybolic	No problem! Actually, I should install that...
