2010-02-27T06:22:00.000Z	IceDane		So, I just installed a fresh install of 9.10 on my laptop because the sound was a clusterfuck after upgrading from 9.04. I *still* cannot play sound from two sources at a time, however. Could this because mpd uses alsa directly? Do I need to make it use pulseaudio?
2010-02-27T06:23:00.000Z	IceDane		(E.g., I hear no sound from youtube videos at the same time I play music, need to stop playing music)
2010-02-27T06:24:00.000Z	IceDane		Also, can someone tell me what's going on with the sounds when tab-completing stuff in a terminal? It's not the beep, as it's muted
2010-02-27T06:25:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	You're talking about the "bell"?
2010-02-27T06:25:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	It could be that, yes
2010-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	It's still a "bell", even if it's muted. Under some sessions it can flash the screen. You may want to set the bell-style to none in xinputrc. Or something. I always have to google that.
2010-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	What's your sound card?
2010-02-27T06:26:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	Some realtek(alc268), using hda intel drivers
2010-02-27T06:28:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	Maybe there's a way to "dpkg-reconfigure" some alsa / pulseaudio stuff that will take advantage of the fact that you upgraded? I'm guessing.
2010-02-27T06:28:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	I reinstalled completely
2010-02-27T06:28:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	That answers that. :-/
2010-02-27T06:29:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	Which is why I'm pretty baffled. I'm still getting strange 'sound takeovers'
2010-02-27T06:29:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	Yeah, but not everything's been converted to use it yet. :-(
2010-02-27T06:29:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	how do I know if I'm even using it?
2010-02-27T06:30:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	Good question. I'm a recent convert from Gentoo, and, there, I used to just eliminate pulseaudio from my system entirely.
2010-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	Yeah.. That's what I tried to do last time, before reisntalling completely
2010-02-27T06:33:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	So, I don't think removing pulseaudio will be such a good idea.. I just tried playing sound through pulseaudio in VLC, and it's lagging to utter s**t.
2010-02-27T06:34:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	What desktop environment do you run?
2010-02-27T06:34:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	Fluxbox - think it might affect it?
2010-02-27T06:35:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	Well, I was just going to say that, if you were running Gnome, I'd go for installing MORE gstreamer stuff, not taking stuff out.
2010-02-27T06:35:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	But I'm not sure if Flux is as "plugged" into gstreamer as Gnome.
2010-02-27T06:35:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	God this seems strange, all of it, heh..
2010-02-27T06:36:00.000Z	Dunkirk	IceDane	I agree. I've been through many of these types of switchovers in Linux land over the years. It sucks if you get caught out.
2010-02-27T06:37:00.000Z	IceDane	Dunkirk	I'll just ask on ubuntuforums or something - thanks for the help.
