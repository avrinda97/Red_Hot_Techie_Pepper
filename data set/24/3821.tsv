2009-11-02T07:08:00.000Z	CommonClone		I upgraded to grub2, and everything worked fine until I did the upgrade-grub-from-legacy command.  Now grub gives me an error 15./  I assume that something is misconfigured.  I am using a livecd right now.  Can someone please help me configure grub so that I can boot from my hd?
2009-11-02T07:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	When you upgraded to grub2 was there any prompt?
2009-11-02T07:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	You needed to select your hard drive so that grub2 would be installed to the master boot record, you can do that from the LiveCD to fix it
2009-11-02T07:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	Boot into a liveCD, mount your Ubuntu partition to /mnt ( or replace /mnt with whatever your mountpoint is ) and then run: "sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc && sudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys && sudo chroot /mnt dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc"
2009-11-02T07:14:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, thanks.  I'll give that a try.
2009-11-02T07:16:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, I tried and I get "chroot: cannot run command 'dpkg-reconfigure': Exec format error"
2009-11-02T07:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	You have 64 bit Ubuntu installed but 32 bit liveCD
2009-11-02T07:17:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	so I need to try using a 64 bit live cd?  or is there no other way?
2009-11-02T07:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	To fix grub instead run "sudo grub install /dev/sda1 --root-directory=/mnt" then be sure to run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" once you are booted into your system
2009-11-02T07:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	Sorry, typo
2009-11-02T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	Should be "sudo grub-install /dev/sda --root-directory=/mnt"
2009-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, where /dev/sda should be my 9.10 partition?  in my case, sda5 right?
2009-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	No, it's referring to the entire drive, not a single partition
2009-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok
2009-11-02T07:35:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, I was able to boot into my 9.10 partition.  so far so good, not I ran dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc and it is asking me to confirm the parameters.  is there anything I should be concerned with here?
2009-11-02T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	Press space bar to select your drive
2009-11-02T07:38:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	the parameters it is asking me for are "vga=795" and "quiet splash".  after I confirm these, the screen exits and I get an error: "mktemp: failed to create file via template `/tmp/grub.XXXXXXXXXX': Invalid argument"
2009-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	If you run "echo $?" right after the dpkg-reconfigure command what does it output?
2009-11-02T07:40:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, I ran echo $? and it just displays "1"
2009-11-02T07:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	Try running "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2009-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	ok, now should I try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc"?
2009-11-02T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	No, now you're done
2009-11-02T07:44:00.000Z	CommonClone	Jordan_U	oh, ok.  thanks very much for your help
2009-11-02T07:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CommonClone	np
