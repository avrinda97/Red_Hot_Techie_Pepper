2010-09-11T04:25:00.000Z	replicasex		So any advice about partition resizing?  The only step that I'm unsure about it is after creating my desired unallocated space, do I just resize the ubuntu part. and it will automatically resize with the unallocated space or do I need to format that space into ext4 beforehand?
2010-09-11T04:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 that wouldent make sence.
2010-09-11T04:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 just resize.. it handles it
2010-09-11T04:26:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	so essentially I just use gparted to resize the larger windows partition and then increasing ubuntu space should just work automatically?
2010-09-11T04:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 yes  - I tend to let windows shrink windows partitons. it tends to be a LOT faster at the job
2010-09-11T04:27:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	yeah, I'm a bit worried that ubuntu will explode windows if I use gparted on it.
2010-09-11T04:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 when in doubt.. backup impiorntant stuff.
2010-09-11T04:28:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	of course, of course I always backup stuff before any major change.
2010-10-18T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 add an alpha channel. and you got a transparent layer.
2010-10-18T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 compiz has a feaure to set the transparancy of any window also. that would affect everything in the window however. :) may not do it how you like.
2010-10-18T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 because its a clear transparent layer...
2010-10-18T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 i seem to recall some articals about that theme on omgubuntu or webupd8 web sites about transpoarent panels.. but thats been a while.
2010-11-05T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 yes - it should.
2010-11-05T05:34:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	sigh :(
2010-11-05T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 there are some PPA's out for newer versions of Xorg. but ive never needed touse it.
2010-11-05T05:35:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	the problem is that apparently my system's nvidia card/driver isn't very compatible with it.
2010-11-05T05:35:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	it's frustrating.
2010-11-05T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 you can install the netbook-destop package.
2010-11-05T18:39:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	ActionParsnip yeah I just had a bad experience installing kubuntu dekstop environ and having it be horribly messy to remove -- how easy would it be to remove Unity/UNBR?
2010-11-05T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 thats an issue of how the meta-packages work..  the netbook stuff added a new meni entry to gnome for the Netbook interfaec.. is all i saw it do.
2010-11-05T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 not near as cluttered as if you would have kubuntu and ubuntu both installed.
2010-11-05T18:41:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	good cuz that was a bloody nightmare :p
2011-01-21T00:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	replicasex	 I was thinking the Ubuntu-tweak tool let you tweak the titlebar/button placements very easially
2011-01-21T00:57:00.000Z	replicasex	Dr_Willis	that's what I thought but it seems to only let me place one spacer inbetween it o.O
