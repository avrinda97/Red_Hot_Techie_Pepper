2010-06-19T20:46:00.000Z	arunkumar413		hello,can anyone help me how to install mono-devel.This package is not in the synaptic
2010-06-19T20:48:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	there's mono-1.0-devel and mono-2.0-devel (those are the packagenames)
2010-06-19T20:50:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	it seems that i've installed the mono.but i cannot compile or run in the mono-develp IDE
2010-06-19T20:51:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	don't know about mono, but the packagenames are as I said
2010-06-19T20:51:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	is there is channel for mono on freenode
2010-06-19T20:52:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	there's ##mono, but very few users
2010-06-19T20:52:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	official channel no @freenode but @irc.gnome.org
2010-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	that means something is not installed right?
2010-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	but it is installed
2010-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	?
2010-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	i'm trying to build nm from source
2010-07-03T13:29:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	yes, and...?
2010-07-03T13:30:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	install what it asks for.
2010-07-03T13:30:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	ya tried,it says the version is already the newest.see this  http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/JA1TfjaP
2010-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	ok, you're close, but missing the point :) It says it is missing the wirelesstools development files. Not wireless tools itself
2010-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	wait, let me see which package it is
2010-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	how to proceed
2010-07-03T13:34:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	I think I found the package, but let me show you: Go to http://packages.ubuntu.com, enter "wireless development" in searchbox, tick the descriptions and it'll show up with relevant packages
2010-07-03T13:35:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	my guess is you need package "libiw-dev"
2010-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	sorry my network is slow
2010-07-03T13:42:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	its asking for dbus
2010-07-03T13:42:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	No package 'dbus-1' found
2010-07-03T13:45:00.000Z	oCean_	arunkumar413	If you insist on rebuilding/compiling it yourself, restart your search at packages.ubuntu.com, and find all dependencies you need. Could be lots of work, that is why we recommend to use packages from the repositories
2010-07-03T13:55:00.000Z	arunkumar413	oCean_	how to set those variables
