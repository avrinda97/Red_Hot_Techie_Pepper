2005-10-04T12:53:00.000Z	kemik		hard work pays off after time.. laziness always pays off _now_
2005-10-04T12:54:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	This is no time for jokes, you know.
2005-10-04T12:54:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 check filepermissions on your file
2005-10-04T12:54:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 and make sure they're ok
2005-10-04T12:54:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	yeah, but before I logged out I had similar problems for a lot of other stuff
2005-10-04T12:55:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	even though i had 777 on the files
2005-10-04T12:55:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	It started with OOo not wanting to save my files
2005-10-04T12:56:00.000Z	procrastinator		and at a point, something wouldn't start because it claimed there were no more free space on /tmp
2005-10-04T12:57:00.000Z	procrastinator		and know I'm _sure_ that I have lots of space on both my / and my /home
2005-10-04T13:00:00.000Z	procrastinator		plenty of helpers this evening
2005-10-04T13:00:00.000Z	procrastinator		rebooting.
2005-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 have you been root on your system often ?
2005-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	yes
2005-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	procrastinator		and now I'm logged in
2005-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 that's probably why your system is fubar'ed
2005-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 there's a *reason* why you should not be root
2005-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	well, it seems it was lack of space on /
2005-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	kemik	procrastinator	 ok
2005-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	and then a reboot
2005-10-04T13:07:00.000Z	procrastinator	kemik	Well, of course I don't log in as root
