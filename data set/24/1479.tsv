2009-12-25T05:29:00.000Z	|black|		I have a question regarding Intel C2D E7400
2009-12-25T05:29:00.000Z	|black|		can any one help please?
2009-12-25T05:29:00.000Z	|black|		nice
2009-12-25T05:29:00.000Z	|black|		mate I am just confused my processor is 64bit or 32bit?
2009-12-25T05:29:00.000Z	|black|		I know it supports 64 but is it native?
2009-12-25T05:30:00.000Z	|black|		like will I get performance boost if I switch from ubuntu 32bit to 64bit?
2009-12-25T05:30:00.000Z	|black|		I know its supported
2009-12-25T05:31:00.000Z	|black|		so it guarentees that I wil get perform. boost?
2009-12-25T05:31:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	also, 64bit only boosts performance for some applications, but makes everything require a little extra ram.
2009-12-25T05:32:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	*ENcoding things, and compressing/decompressing are the main things to benefit from 64bit. Are you doing those things?
2009-12-25T05:33:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	I do coding and processor intesive work will it help, and I have 2gb but getting another 2gb stick is not a prob
2009-12-25T05:34:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	I don't actually know for that. it might, and the extra ram can be helpful.
2009-12-25T05:34:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	coz I heard maybe a rumor, that 64bit is supported in C2D but not native (in hardware)
2009-12-25T05:35:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	Core 2 Duo is native 64bit. Some of the chips preceding it are too, but very few. Native 64bit doesn't mean it has the physical addressing space of 64bit, because NO ONE needs that yet.
2009-12-25T05:36:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	Thanks that all I needed to know and yes 4gb is enuf at ram 16gb is not yet main stream
2009-12-25T05:37:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	means any app/OS compiled for 64bit will be faster, provided I have enuf ram
2009-12-25T05:37:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	more or less. not everything will benefit though.
2009-12-25T05:38:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	but still there is + not -ve in switching to 64 right?
2009-12-25T05:39:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	a tiny amount of programs don't work on 64bit. last I heard, and the flash plugin is unstable if you use the default one.
2009-12-25T05:40:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	thats agreeable.
2009-12-25T05:40:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	one last question mate, can i upgrade to 64 or do i need re install?
2009-12-25T05:40:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	|black|	I think you gotta reinstall
2009-12-25T05:41:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	that sux a bit but will give it a shot
2009-12-25T05:49:00.000Z	|black|	Bob_Dole	thanks mate you helped alot!
