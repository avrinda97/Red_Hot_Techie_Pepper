2005-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	how would you else permit a gui app. as a x-server?
2005-06-17T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	running X as root, which is what he wants to do, is deprecated, dumb and dangerous: I discourage it and instead suggest gksudo
2005-06-17T08:26:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	yeah
2005-08-09T11:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	mpg321 is a commandline program - it has no X frontend as such although various players can use it as a back end
2005-08-09T11:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	you could try running   gst-register-0.8  to register any plugins you have installed
2005-08-09T11:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	xmms does not use the gstreamer engine - rhythmbox does though
2005-08-09T11:33:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	but i downloaded the plugin
2005-08-09T11:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	try running gst-register-0.8   in a terminal and see if it registers your plugins
2005-08-09T11:35:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	i did it
2005-08-09T11:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	did it say it was registering stuff?
2005-08-09T11:36:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	i think it did Rebuilding user_registry (/root/.gstreamer-0.8/registry.xml) ...
2005-08-09T11:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	OK well try closing and rerunning rhythmbox and see what happens
2005-08-09T11:37:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	i just did it and doesnt work
2005-08-09T11:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	I would try killing esd again and then re run it (I suspect esd is confused somehow)
2005-08-09T11:39:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	howdo i do it
2005-08-09T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	killall esd
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	then try again with rhythmbox
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	killall esd esd: no process killed
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	OK run esd &
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	include the &
2005-08-09T11:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	OK it should be fine from now on
2005-08-09T11:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	steven	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2005-08-09T11:42:00.000Z	steven	thoreauputic	thanks
