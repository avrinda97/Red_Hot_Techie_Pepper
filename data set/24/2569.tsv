2008-11-05T16:49:00.000Z	firetech		What can be the cause if X11 doesn't regain keyboard control (it's left in the console) after suspend/hibernate? This ONLY seems to happen if the computer is booted on battery (laptop).
2008-11-05T16:50:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	i dont know but you could check usb power safe things
2008-11-05T16:50:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	it only affects the internal laptop keyboard, not external USB ones...
2008-11-05T16:51:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	oh strange, i'll check that right now on my laptop
2008-11-05T16:52:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	thanks :)
2008-11-05T16:52:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	btw, it happens both with uswsusp and the default kernel suspend.
2008-11-05T16:53:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	could take some time, i just see i dont have any suspend/hibernate option anymore :D
2008-11-05T16:57:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	i cant test atm, my laptop is running crazy
2008-11-05T16:57:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	hehe...
2008-11-05T17:00:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	acpid just needed about 5min to shutdown.. may thats the source of these problems
2008-11-05T17:01:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	that sounds... umm... nice.
2008-11-05T17:02:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	i always say.. for stable systems i would wait at least 2 weeks with upgrading... well i could not wait that long :D
2008-11-05T17:04:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	I have run intrepid since october 5, funny thing is that this keyboard problem wasn't present from the beginning (or in hardy)
2008-11-05T17:05:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	tried an older kernel?
2008-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	Tried it on a similar laptop (same model, slightly different internals) running a fresh intrepid installation and the problem wasn't there. utterly disturbing.
2008-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	I don't really have the time or energy to reinstall, either...
2008-11-05T17:09:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	but you should have older kernels when you have intrepid since 5. oct?
2008-11-05T17:10:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	I have removed all of them :/
2008-11-05T17:10:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	can only say keyboard works for me after hibernate
2008-11-05T17:11:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	try a recent one from the repos then
2008-11-05T17:11:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	I'm gonna try an apt-get install --reinstall of all installed packages ;)
2008-11-05T17:12:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	try an older kernel first ;)
2008-11-05T17:17:00.000Z	firetech	Dedi	problem is I doubt I'll find a sufficiently old kernel since the problem started to occur slightly after intrepid RC...
2008-11-05T17:20:00.000Z	Dedi	firetech	i have plenty old kernels in synaptic
