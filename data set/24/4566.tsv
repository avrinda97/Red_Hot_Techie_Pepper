2008-08-02T17:03:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Nope :/
2008-08-02T17:02:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	yeah that's annoying... Gutsy any use?
2008-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	SSD card? like a memory card?
2008-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Yes
2008-08-02T17:00:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	it *should* auto-mount as soon as you've plugged it in (assuming Ubuntu recognises your card reader)
2008-08-02T17:00:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Yeah, that's the problem (I think) but couldn't it be something with the fact that I use Feisty?
2008-08-02T17:01:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	It might be - I couldn't list the hardware support differences but as Freakshow says, it's worth upgrading (unless Hardy doesn't work for you)
2008-08-02T17:02:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	I doesn't work completely (no wired internet :/) due to a kernel error :S
2008-08-02T17:03:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	have you reported the driver bug to launchpad so somebody can fix it?
2008-08-02T17:03:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	I know none of this helps you now - but yeah...
2008-08-02T17:04:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	I found the bug in there. So it is reported :) But thanks :)
2008-08-02T17:05:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	well... as far as your current issue goes... oh! have you used the card in that reader before?
2008-08-02T17:05:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Nope I haven't :S
2008-08-02T17:06:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	it's not a SD-HC card is it?
2008-08-02T17:06:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Nope it's a SSD card
2008-08-02T17:08:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	Can I have the make/model and your computer make/model
2008-08-02T17:09:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	What do you mean by make? It's an Acer TravelMate 4310
2008-08-02T17:10:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	and of the card?
2008-08-02T17:12:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	is it 32gigs?
2008-08-02T17:12:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Nope megs :P
2008-08-02T17:16:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	check out this thread: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/2535
2008-08-02T17:16:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	Great thanks a lot :D
2008-08-02T17:16:00.000Z	Oli``	eax	it's not an "easy" fix. Compiling drivers and horrible jazz like that... but it might work. It worked for other people using your laptop
2008-08-02T17:18:00.000Z	eax	Oli``	I'm used to compiling so it's play :P Great thanks a lot mate ^^
