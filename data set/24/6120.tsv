2006-01-09T14:11:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	you will leave the channel rather rapidly if you do not use paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-01-09T14:12:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	iv been on IRC and #debian since the last 8 years.
2006-01-09T14:12:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	any more than a line or two of output
2006-01-09T14:12:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	scroll up and see what I pasted two lines and then one.
2006-01-09T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	I am not looking for an arguement - friendly advice don't paste but you know that if you were in that other place and I did look at your pastebin
2006-01-09T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	I can't for the life of me think why that happens and I should know
2006-01-09T14:15:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	I dont need to read the topic to know i shouldnt paste.
2006-01-09T14:15:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	but gnomefreak was just being a  jerk
2006-01-09T14:16:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	can we get back "on topic" more to the point
2006-01-09T14:16:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	lets all live on the same planet, now I am going to look at that pastebin again and then do some sniffing about I do have the answer
2006-01-09T14:20:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	couple of ideas worth a try (A) change the http for ftp if it fails (B) for a short time try ie.archive I use it with ftp for all
2006-01-09T14:22:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	well?
2006-01-09T14:24:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	anyways when i stat the Package.gz on universe what I get is--->  gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
2006-01-09T14:25:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	what i am saying is if I wget the Package.gz for universe and un-gzip it by hand and place it where it needs to be apt works . otherwise it exits with the "not gzip format error"
2006-01-09T14:26:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	not had it as specific as that before - hmm
2006-01-09T14:27:00.000Z	spoonaman2	ompaul	wait i will paste the whole thing in pastebin
2006-01-09T14:28:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	go for it
2006-01-09T14:40:00.000Z	ompaul	spoonaman2	whats happening
