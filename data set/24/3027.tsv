2008-10-02T00:24:00.000Z	movedx		How does one repair a Ubuntu installation? I have a seperate partition for my '/' mount point, a 2gB swap partition and the rest is mounted to '/home'. How do I repair '/' using an installation CD in the event I ever need too?
2008-10-02T00:25:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	you just reinstall to / format / only and tell partitioner that home is there and not to format it
2008-10-02T00:25:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	I did just that, but I still lost all the applications I installed. My '/home' partition was left in good order.
2008-10-02T00:26:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	yes, all apps will need to be reinstalled, all settings will be preserved
2008-10-02T00:26:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	That's a shame, but acceptable. :)
2008-10-02T00:27:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	there are ways around it, but software installs are so easy there is no point
2008-10-02T00:27:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	They might be easy, but they're also time consuming. This especially true if you've installed a lot of stuff for software development etc.
2008-10-02T00:28:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	you can restore them with a script easily, and use a DVD for repo if you want... but, what would be point of reinstalling unless fresh apps were installed?
2008-10-02T00:28:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	I've requested 'apt' install: vlc, seamonkey, vlc, rxvt-unicode and something else I can't remember and it's 308mB.
2008-10-02T00:28:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	You could re-install core libs and revert the kernel back?
2008-10-02T00:29:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	you can do any of this, it just needs to be setup... and you can reinstall any program at any time without reformatting anyways
2008-10-02T00:29:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	aptitude reinstall bla
2008-10-02T00:30:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	Basically, I installed VirtualBox and the relevant Kernel module, and when I rebooted my graphics card was no longer detected, my sound had failed and my 22" widescreen monitor was in 640x480 resolution; in this instance it's easier to repair the core libs and the Kernel than try and resolve the issue manually.
2008-10-02T00:30:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	Yes. I guess I need to learn the tools available to me and I could have resolved the issue.
2008-10-02T00:30:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	there is no way the core libs or kernel were changed, it is a config issue
2008-10-02T00:31:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	It was a Kernel module that was installed. Perhaps you're right. But I see no reason for VirtualBox to edit the 'xorg.conf' file, and remove sound? Why?
2008-10-02T00:31:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	i can assure you it did not
2008-10-02T00:33:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	Then I guess I leave you with one simple (to ask) question: why did my nVidia driver(s) fail and why did my sound card suddenly become non-existant? There's no valid explanation to this from your reasoning, except the Kernel module installed during the VirtualBox installation somewhere messed with something.
2008-10-02T00:34:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	cause you made a mistake most likely
2008-10-02T00:35:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	That's not something I haven't consider, though it wouldn't be me that made the mistake, more apt. Simply installing VB using "apt-get install virtualbox" hardly makes it my fault.
2008-10-02T00:36:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	If the application isn't supported correctly, then that's also not my fault. besides, you've answered my question now, thanks for your time.
2008-10-02T00:37:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	I personally think my mistake was using the restricted drivers that come with Ubuntu. I should have used EnvyNG, which is what I've done this time around.
2008-10-02T00:38:00.000Z	ejer	movedx	could be but I use restricted drivers... there are many things at play
2008-10-02T00:38:00.000Z	movedx	ejer	I think I'll just use VMWare - more support and more functionality! ;)
