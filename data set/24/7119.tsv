2005-07-16T10:48:00.000Z	fr500	concept10	no, wifi mostly
2005-07-16T10:49:00.000Z	fr500	concept10	the clients have to get the equipment by themselves, and being free there is no guaranted level of service
2005-07-16T10:50:00.000Z	fr500	concept10	but the free wan links we provide are making lan partys a lot of fun :)
2005-07-16T11:00:00.000Z	fr500	concept10	he does not have bad dvd playback performance, he has bad performance after watching dvds
2005-07-16T11:01:00.000Z	concept10	fr500	my bad performance is due to dma being off
2005-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	fr500	concept10	dma off gives bad dvd playback, but doesnt slow down the pc after playing back has ended
2005-07-16T11:02:00.000Z	concept10	fr500	hmmm....
