2007-11-06T15:32:00.000Z	paolo		but when I unplug one disk to simulate a disk failure
2007-11-06T15:32:00.000Z	paolo		I can't boot any more
2007-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	paolo		rather, grub starts, but hangs on read-error on swap-device
2007-11-06T15:34:00.000Z	paolo		i get the initramfs prompt and I'm stuck there
2007-11-06T15:36:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	what linux kernel-version do you have? i do _always_ get the initramfs prompt after a dist-upgrade... (without having unplugged anything!)
2007-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I have a fresh installation of edubuntu 7.10
2007-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I don't know the Kernel version by heart
2007-11-06T15:37:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	uname -r
2007-11-06T15:40:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	same here... :( maybe it's worth to try: sudo mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-generic.bak /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-generic
2007-11-06T15:40:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	and then?
2007-11-06T15:42:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	reboot... :) if you have luck, something you installed changed your initrd.img - if not, i don't know. :(
2007-11-06T15:42:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/47768 someone reported that changing the SATA controller worked.
2007-11-06T15:45:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	Wait a sec, I'm not sure I've unterdstood right: I have to bak the kernel while I'm in initramfs or while I'm up and running with both disks?
2007-11-06T15:45:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I have a fakeraid on the mobo, but I've disabled it on the BIOS
2007-11-06T15:46:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I've found this thread full of hope: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-438996.html
2007-11-06T15:46:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	you cannot boot to your system anymore? is chainloading possible? otherwise you might neet to boot from floppy/cd/usb...
2007-11-06T15:47:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I can boot nromally with both disks
2007-11-06T15:48:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	either one or the other
2007-11-06T15:49:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	I don't know whether to try to install grub on each disk on block 1 as explained in the link I just posted
2007-11-06T15:50:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	but the mdrun is not among the initramfs commands in my case
2007-11-06T15:53:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	sorry, don't know then...
2007-11-06T15:55:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	yes - restore, not backup...
2007-11-06T15:56:00.000Z	paolo	redtux	thank, I'll give it a try. I have to leave now, thanks for your help! have a nice one
2007-11-06T15:56:00.000Z	redtux	paolo	ciao :)
