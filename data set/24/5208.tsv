2012-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	chamunks	devslash	its likely ultra painless.
2012-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	chamunks		whats your issue?
2012-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	devslash		i installed it but i can't access the webui
2012-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	devslash		ps -A shows utserver is running
2012-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	devslash		i put in my browser myip:8080//gui
2012-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	devslash		oops theres supposed to be 1 slash
2012-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	devslash		inside
2012-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	devslash		from another computer on my lan
2012-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	devslash		i cant
2012-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	devslash		my server doesn't have X installed
2012-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	devslash		its a headless server
2012-09-26T09:07:00.000Z	devslash		ok
2012-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	devslash		i think it loaded but i can't see anything
2012-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	devslash		it asked me if i want to proceed without a password
2012-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	chamunks	devslash	utorrent usually doesn't ship with the webui itself
2012-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	devslash		actually i checked and it does
2012-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	chamunks		in the windows version for the longest time (dont know if this has changed) you would be able to enable it but you still had to download its webui files separately.
2012-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	chamunks	devslash	than I would check to see if it has some sort of subdir in apache.
2012-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	chamunks		so for example localhost/phpmyadmin
2012-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	devslash	cfhowlett	does the server have to be installed in my apache directory
2012-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	devslash		ahh
2012-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	devslash		i know what the problem is
2012-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	chamunks	devslash	what happened?
