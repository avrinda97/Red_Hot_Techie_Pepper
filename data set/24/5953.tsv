2006-03-22T14:24:00.000Z	Mantice		Yeah
2006-03-22T14:25:00.000Z	Mantice		My computer CPU went to 100 degress in windows man
2006-03-22T14:25:00.000Z	Mantice		and Ive only been in windows for 10 days max
2006-03-22T14:25:00.000Z	Mantice		lucky it dident burn the mighty amd 64 out :)
2006-03-22T14:25:00.000Z	Mantice		100 c
2006-03-22T14:26:00.000Z	Mantice		Well I could smell it burning and the heat sink was so hot I burnt my self on it
2006-03-22T14:26:00.000Z	Mantice		and the computer turned off :(
2006-03-22T14:27:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	The OS would not effect that...
2006-03-22T14:27:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	turning off the CPU fan is a bad idea
2006-03-22T14:29:00.000Z	Mantice	DBO	I meant 100% fan speed
2006-03-22T14:29:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	I know, but nothing software can do short of turning off fans should cause your PC to overheat
2006-03-22T14:32:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	you can get lm_sensors to check your CPU tempurature in ubuntu
2006-03-22T14:33:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	You have serious cooling issues, you should do something about them
2006-03-22T14:45:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	yeah, I was wrong the firstime, its a dash, not an underscore
2006-03-22T14:48:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	type "sudo sensor-detect"
2006-03-22T14:50:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	my bad, its "sudo sensors-detect"
2006-03-22T14:50:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	just give it a big yes for everything, it will ask you at some point ISA or or SMBus, I used ISA
2006-03-22T14:58:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	I like MythTV
2006-05-25T14:49:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	MythTV is good for tuner usage
2006-05-25T14:49:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	you will need to compile the IVTV module to make that happen though
2006-05-25T14:51:00.000Z	DBO	Mantice	so what do you want me to do about it?
