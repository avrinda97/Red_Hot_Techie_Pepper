2010-05-05T11:46:00.000Z	econtomawesome		Help! I've downloaded the x64bit flash for Ubuntu 10.04 and the only thing in the tarball is a .so file. What to do???
2010-05-05T11:47:00.000Z	bp0	econtomawesome	 put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2010-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	just the .so file?
2010-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	bp0		yes
2010-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	I don't have to "install" it?
2010-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	bp0		no
2010-05-05T11:49:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	then what?
2010-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	then what?
2010-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	bp0	econtomawesome	done. restart firefox
2010-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	bp0		check about:plugins and see if it is listed
2010-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	still gives an error
2010-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	bp0		what does
2010-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	bp0		what does about:plugins say
2010-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	no information about adobe
2010-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	do I need to reinstall the package from the repositories in addition to putting the .so file in the plugins folder
2010-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	bp0		no, either/or
2010-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	bp0		either use the package or use the file from adobe, not both
2010-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	econtomawesome		hmm
2010-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	flash from youtube runs fine, but I upgraded to 10.04 and now hulu is broken
2010-05-05T11:57:00.000Z	bp0	econtomawesome	hulu doesnt work on amd64
2010-05-05T11:57:00.000Z	bp0		you've got to use the 32bit flash with wrapper
2010-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	It worked fine under 9.10--what happened? Should I install 32-bit firefox?
2010-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	ah, I see what you said
2010-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	econtomawesome	bp0	kk
