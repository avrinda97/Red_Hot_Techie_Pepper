2007-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	MySQL AND PostGRE? lol
2007-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	gcc isn't in /usr/lib.
2007-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	mine is lol
2007-05-23T12:07:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	i doubt it. what's the output of  apt-cache policy gcc | grep Installed  ?
2007-05-23T12:08:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	you can run that command even with no networking.
2007-05-23T12:09:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	how have you installed GCC?
2007-05-23T12:11:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	its in the initial Ubuntu install
2007-05-23T12:11:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	uhm, no it isn't (not if you installed the normal Desktop version at any rate). no compiler is installed by default.
2007-05-23T12:12:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	above ^^
2007-05-23T12:12:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	well, then if they really are installed, there's something quite wrong, because "whereis gcc" should *definitely* give "/usr/bin/gcc"
2007-05-23T12:13:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	what about the output of  dpkg -L gcc | grep bin  ? does it show anything?
2007-05-23T12:13:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	I thought it'd be there too
2007-05-23T12:14:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	lemme check
2007-05-23T12:14:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	well, whatever the reason why it's not there is, the right solution is *not* to change your path. besides, /usr/lib/gcc isn't even a file, it's a directory.
2007-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	it says no
2007-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	it says what?
2007-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	EH!?
2007-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	get the package
2007-05-23T12:16:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	err, then how are you even going to get the tarball?
2007-05-23T12:17:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	a .deb file isn't any harder to get then a tarball
2007-05-23T12:17:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	DL it here and throw it on a jumpdrive
2007-05-23T12:17:00.000Z	LjL	wkdown	and why can't you do it with the proper package, in a sane way?
2007-05-23T12:17:00.000Z	wkdown	LjL	cuz I suck like that lol
