2012-11-16T20:47:00.000Z	jgspratt		basically the same thing as pulling the physcal plug
2012-11-16T20:47:00.000Z	jgspratt		right, exactly
2012-11-16T20:47:00.000Z	jgspratt		I want to make them not do that anymore
2012-11-16T20:47:00.000Z	jgspratt		Right, its not the button
2012-11-16T20:48:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	was all these servers built out of a lot of hardware?
2012-11-16T20:51:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	install a new drive to one of them, and see if you can get this one to crash..
2012-11-16T20:52:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	only time ive seen this was failed hw..or a poorly written script left to run
2012-11-16T20:54:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	I'm getting a log of "21.560052] w83795 0-002f: Failed to read from register 0x089, err -5"
2012-11-16T20:54:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	sounds like something is breaking..
2012-11-16T20:55:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	what kind of thing?
2012-11-16T20:56:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	sudo lshw, and check your hardware for known issues..then test accordly

2012-11-16T21:00:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	is there a PCI line to match that error -5 line?
2012-11-16T21:01:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	which part of the error should I search for?  I'm looking...
2012-11-16T21:04:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	dmesg: http://hastebin.com/pixiqoqola.coffee
2012-11-16T21:05:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	(and thanks for all your help! much appreciated!)
2012-11-16T21:06:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	do you know what err -5 is?  google gives a bunch for err -6, which is related to fans maybe
2012-11-16T21:09:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	I don't have -6 though. I have -5. much rarer.  The fans are going. I can hear them.
2012-11-16T21:10:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	VGA access? I can access the plug.
2012-11-16T21:11:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	but that doesn't mean I get output :(
2012-11-16T21:21:00.000Z	jgspratt	blackness	what else would you recommend logging?
2012-11-17T03:37:00.000Z	blackness	jgspratt	get it figured out?
