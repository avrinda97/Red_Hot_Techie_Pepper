2006-12-15T17:29:00.000Z	khaled		can anyone help plz
2006-12-15T17:29:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	"grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list"
2006-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	you should get only one line not starting with #
2006-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	what does this do?
2006-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	can u explain more plz?
2006-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	grep searches for a pattern in a file. grep universe will show lines which have "universe" in them.
2006-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	you should only have one line in /etc/apt/sources.list showing universe, unless the others start with # which means they are commented out
2006-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	grep... gave me 6 lines
2006-12-15T17:32:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	yes I see, do any of them start with deb and no #?
2006-12-15T17:32:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	all of them
2006-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	did you "enable universe", and if so, how?
2006-12-15T17:34:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	i was trying to get my nvidia driver to work so i following the instructions in www.ubuntuguide/wiki/... and one of the steps was to modify sources.list
2006-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	khaled	morgs	would u line me to copy and paste my source.list
2006-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and paste in the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	morgs	khaled	then give the link here
