2012-09-08T22:54:00.000Z	Troy^		install in windows? i wouldn't trust that
2012-09-08T22:54:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	your my samba guy! you there?
2012-09-08T22:55:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	yea i'm here
2012-09-08T22:58:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	got samba working fine on my nix boxes but i allways get prompted for uname + pass on win machines, I am using a very simple smb.conf setup [family share]
2012-09-08T22:59:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	let me show you mine
2012-09-08T23:01:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1193247/
2012-09-08T23:01:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	that is all that is in my /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-09-08T23:02:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	thanks i will try setting up the global and look into the mask
2012-09-08T23:02:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	do you have the drives mounted in windows 7? you know what i mean?
2012-09-08T23:03:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	Im not sure i understand. Any time i try to go to them 7 and XP it prompts for uname + psswd
2012-09-08T23:04:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	have you added them as mounted in my computer? so you can just click on them and they are given a drive letter
2012-09-08T23:05:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	In windows? map the drive? It wont let me without uname etc. Right no just trying to browse to them through the workgroup
2012-09-08T23:05:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	put the username and pass in
2012-09-08T23:06:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	thats the problem i dont have one
2012-09-08T23:06:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	doh, it is the uname and pass of your linux box. or it may possibly be blank
2012-09-08T23:06:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	nope tried all that
2012-09-08T23:07:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	just modify it
2012-09-08T23:08:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	yea i bet its the lack of a global section in my .conf. I as uner the impresion that asnt nessacery for simple shares and its not for nix boxes but perhaps thats what is giving me the fits on my dohs boxes. Thanks again that should get me pointed in the right direction
2012-09-08T23:14:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	does the security = user line make it so that a user account from the samba server has to used? My wife would have to use my acct or i would have to make her one to acces the share?
2012-09-08T23:16:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	security = user required uname and pass of the linux box and then windows will most likely never ask again especially if you have it mounted in my computer
2012-09-08T23:16:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	k
2012-09-08T23:20:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	LOL it never even prompted for uname etc
2012-09-08T23:20:00.000Z	bfortified	Troy^	Thanks man your a huge help
2012-09-08T23:21:00.000Z	Troy^	bfortified	there you go i knew it was either one of those couldn't quite remember because i have the shared drives mount in my computer and they are always there accessible when i reboot etc.
