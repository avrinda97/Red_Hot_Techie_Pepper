2011-09-16T06:09:00.000Z	dragondon		has anyone here run a TeamSpeak server on ubuntu?
2011-09-16T06:10:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	aye
2011-09-16T06:10:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	I can connect to localhost but nothing from the outside.  it seems that while the program is running, it still isn't listening to any real ports.  telnet localhost 10011 fails.  suggestions?
2011-09-16T06:12:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	you should look at netstat, and possibly the syslog
2011-09-16T06:12:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	also, how many interfaces/ips does your server have?
2011-09-16T06:13:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	did you make sure you don't have a packet filter (firewall) blocking the telnet stuff?
2011-09-16T06:14:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	yeah, my iptables should be good.  I got telnet to work(port 22) last night from both the lan and the wan, now can't seem to get TS to work, despite copying the same format.
2011-09-16T06:17:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	you can force an ip onto TS3
2011-09-16T06:17:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	please have a look at the file ts3server_startscript.sh (if you use that)
2011-09-16T06:18:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	edit the line with COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS to be COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS="voice_ip=X.X.X.X ..."  with X.X.X.X being your IP, and ... being whatever else there was in there before
2011-09-16T06:24:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	you still working on TS3?
2011-09-16T06:25:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	I don't use a startup script.  I was looking at the server.ini file, saw the first line that said 'boundtoip1', but it was empty
2011-09-16T06:26:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	boundtoip1 seems to do the same, but you can pass that as a command line parameter just the same.
2011-09-16T06:27:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	./ts3serverbinaryname voice_ip=X.X.X.X somemoreoptions > /dev/null &
2011-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	will have to continue later, got something telse to do for a bit, will be back.  thanks!
2011-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	ts3 does not come with upstart files, sadly
2011-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	back, had to make brunch for the wife :)
2011-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	" ./ts3serverbinaryname voice_ip=X.X.X.X somemoreoptions > /dev/null &"  this looks like a command that would have to be run everytime
2011-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	either that, or you put the ts3server_startscript into a wrapper that can be called from initscripts ;)
2011-09-16T06:52:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	linux newbie....I understand the concept but not the implementation.
2011-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	ok then, let's just say you can confiure the supplied ts3server_startscript and test if it works. you can make it permanent later.
2011-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	as dumb as this may sound, I can't find the ts install directory.... locate teamspeak shows me a ton of directories but none of them seem like the install one
2011-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	metabill	dragondon	query me
2011-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	dragondon	metabill	query me?
