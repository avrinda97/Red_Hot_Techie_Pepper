2010-01-11T20:45:00.000Z	Chousuke		amd64 is 64-bit, i386 is 32-bit
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	Chousuke	so do i download the 32bit or 64bit?
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		or it doesnt matteR?
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Chousuke		but, why are you installing a package manually?
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Chousuke		doesn't APT work?
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	Chousuke	i was told to do so?
2010-01-11T20:46:00.000Z	Chousuke		ie. sudo aptitude install wvdial
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	ah, you don't have internet access configured yet?
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	Chousuke	are you saying that the package is included in karmic?
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		nopsey :)
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		i only have dial up lol
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Chousuke		I wonder if those packages are on the CD
2010-01-11T20:48:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		thats what im wondering?
2010-01-11T20:49:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		i thought they might be
2010-01-11T20:49:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		i was told they were
2010-01-11T20:49:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		then ice_age said they arent
2010-01-11T20:49:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart		i dont know?
2010-01-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	hmmh.
2010-01-11T20:50:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	Chousuke	do you think they might be?
2010-01-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	well, I have no way to confirm but wvdial is in the "main" section at least
2010-01-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	so it should be on the cd
2010-01-11T20:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	I would expect Ubuntu to support dial-up internet out of the box.
2010-01-11T20:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Alf_Stewart	but I haven't had dial-up for almost a decade now, so...
2010-01-11T20:51:00.000Z	Alf_Stewart	Chousuke	all i know is when i loaded the live cd i didnt seen anything for dialup options or set up only for broadband or wireless is that because im running the live cd and havnt installed it fully for all the packages to be open?
