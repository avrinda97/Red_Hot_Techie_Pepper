2009-12-10T06:37:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	dumb question, is your AP broadcasting your SSID?
2009-12-10T06:38:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	sometimes wpa_supplicant consider that detail :)  really odd
2009-12-10T06:39:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	- sorry, I didn't catch what you meant by that.  Is that a router setting or an Ubuntu config setting?
2009-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	Ubuntu setting on wpa_supplicant.conf, but I guess you don't use that
2009-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	I don't know a lot about wireless networking, so if it's not the wireless driver or in the default, I don't have it.
2009-12-10T06:44:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	I DO have wpa_supplicant!!!!!!!  Now, what should I be looking at in it?
2009-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	can you post your wpa_supplicant.conf ?
2009-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	yeah, give me just a second
2009-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	do you know offhand where that is in the filesystem.
2009-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	mine is in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
2009-12-10T06:47:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	all that's in my /etc/wpa_supplicant folder are three shell scripts
2009-12-10T06:49:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	I found it.  It reads:
2009-12-10T06:50:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	use pastebin
2009-12-10T06:51:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	It's right here.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/338405/
2009-12-10T06:53:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	not that, it should look like : http://www.y3m.net/docs/gentoo-on-t42/configs/wpa_supplicant.conf
2009-12-10T06:56:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	have you read this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs#Hardware
2009-12-10T06:57:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	that's the first time I've seen THAT page.  I'll have a look at it and do some more homework.  I'm very grateful for being pointed towards a legitimate possibility, though.
2009-12-10T06:59:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	going my way will not be standard, I've compiled supplicant from source against atheros drivers source code. But there are good howtos there, I'm sure one will work for you :)
2009-12-10T07:00:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	you compiled supplicant?
2009-12-10T07:00:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	yes, but just for fun :)
2009-12-10T07:01:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	I'm on an asus aspire one, and when I first got it, the only driver that I could get to work at all was ath5k, and it works only on Linksys routers.
2009-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	it would be very helpful to run wpa_supplicant from command line with -dd flag(verbose mode) to see what happens, anyway read that docs to have a better idea of what could be the problem :)
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	fattom	epinky	Will Do.  thanks a million for the assist.
2009-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	epinky	fattom	you're welcome
