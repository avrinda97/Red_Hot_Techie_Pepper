2012-02-13T02:49:00.000Z	Andrew131		Has anyone else had this weird behavior with usb external drive?  It gets "reset" then all the processes using it are blocked?
2012-02-13T02:49:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	What type of drive is it?
2012-02-13T02:50:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Do you notice the drive spinning up and down when you try to access the drive with that program?
2012-02-13T02:51:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	I was thinking it could be something with poor power management which is causing Ubuntu to unmount the drive which would cause the program lock issue
2012-02-13T02:53:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	It might not be the drive, but the USB controller...
2012-02-13T02:54:00.000Z	Andrew131	pragmaticenigma	I was thinking the same thing
2012-02-13T02:55:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Are you using any USB hubs to connect the drives? Otherwise I would think you might want to get the extra controller
2012-02-13T02:59:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Something that occured to me.. I know that my USB controller has issues with large drives attached for booting and sometimes after the computer is running... It would be a very good idea to try a seperate controller card
2012-02-13T03:09:00.000Z	Andrew131	pragmaticenigma	no I don't use a hub direct connection.  Also not using it for booting I think I am going to try a pci usb controller just to rule to it out.  I've already done bios, kernel, all usb slots and tried drive in another ubuntu machine
2012-02-13T04:42:00.000Z	Andrew131	pragmaticenigma	you here?
2012-02-13T04:44:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Guess another thing to maybe try... Do you have a second computer?
2012-02-13T04:45:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Same version of Ubuntu?
2012-02-13T04:46:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Guess the newer kernel could be to blame.... not sure on that one
2012-02-13T04:48:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	what is the motherboard make?

2012-02-13T04:53:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	I'm stumpped... I'm really surprised that a new card wouldn't have solved the problem for you... Is it possible to boot live and test?
2012-02-13T05:00:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	On board USB is 2.0 I take it?
2012-02-13T05:00:00.000Z	Andrew131	pragmaticenigma	yes
2012-02-13T05:05:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	I'm seeing a ton of posts on the issue dating back a ways...
2012-02-13T05:06:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	Yeah... sadly this isn't the first time I've seen issues with USB and motherboards.

2012-02-13T05:26:00.000Z	Andrew131	pragmaticenigma	did you get the link?  I wasn't paying attention and my bat died
2012-02-13T05:38:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	I have a feeling that it's a driver issue at it's core... seems to be out for awhile but I'm not finding any submissions on bug trackers which concerns me
2012-02-13T05:39:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Andrew131	was there a particular reason that you were trying to use this externally?
