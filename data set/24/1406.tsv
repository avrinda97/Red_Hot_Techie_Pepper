2010-03-26T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xiofire: depends on their requirements of an OS
2010-03-26T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xiofire: just grab a 2gb sd card or usb stick and install on that
2010-03-26T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tlul: you can remove the boot options in /etc/default/grub and you will get a text boot
2010-03-26T23:15:00.000Z	TLUL	ActionParsnip	Which boot option specifically sets it to use the icon instead of a text boot?
2010-03-26T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xiofire: unless you have some specialised hardware or want to play the very latest games then linux as a whole is great
2010-03-26T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tlul: quiet splash, if you remove them and then run: sudo update-grub ,you will get a text boot
2010-03-26T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!hcl | lenovo
2010-03-26T23:17:00.000Z	TLUL	ActionParsnip	Thanks, I need the text boot to see where it is freezing sometimes. Hopefully this will help!
2010-03-26T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xiofire: it may run in wine or you can switch to gimp
2010-03-26T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tlul: you can add / remove options for one shot by edittin grub before it launches the loading
2010-03-26T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tlul: read the grub docs to see how
2010-03-26T23:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ferosaur	copy the music files or simply read the ntfs from ubuntu and you can play them
2010-03-26T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Zummig777: you could have the folder elsewhere then symlink it at boot to make it appear there
2010-03-26T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Feroaur: could symlink the folder to a link in $HOME for easy access
2010-03-26T23:22:00.000Z	TLUL	ActionParsnip	Where in the GRUB docs would I find out how to edit the config for the next boot?
2010-03-26T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!grub | tlul
2010-03-26T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!grub2 | tlul
2010-03-26T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Tlul: hold shift at boot then press e to (e)dit the boot
2010-03-26T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Harjot_: tar can do it
2010-03-26T23:24:00.000Z	TLUL	ActionParsnip	Thanks, I'll try that out.
