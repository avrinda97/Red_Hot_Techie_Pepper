2007-12-03T10:45:00.000Z	secret901		Nickrud, bulmer: What are disabled when I run gnome on failsafe?  I don't have that error when I go to failsafe
2007-12-03T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	I don't know, sorry. I've never really looked at the session startup stuff
2007-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	grep  (and think about installing beagle, I find it Worked For Meâ„¢
2007-12-03T11:09:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	doesn't beagle come with Gibbon?
2007-12-03T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	I thought it was using tracker
2007-12-03T11:10:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	whatever it was, it was useless
2007-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	how do I use grep to search a directory recursively
2007-12-03T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	grep -r (recursive)
2007-12-03T11:13:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	how do I start beagle after it's installed?
2007-12-03T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	system->preferences->session , look for it in the Startup Programs tab
2007-12-03T11:16:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	thanks
2007-12-03T11:16:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	I found the culprit to my gnome problem in a file in /etc/X11/Xsessions.d, can I just delete it outright?
2007-12-03T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	which one?
2007-12-03T11:18:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	it's called 60xvnkb_startup, seems to be added by that program
2007-12-03T11:19:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	or is there a way to rename it so that it doesn't run on startup?
2007-12-03T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	try apt-get -r --purge xvnkb (or the actual package name). Manually changing files in /etc is something you need to be exactly sure about what you are doing
2007-12-03T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	you could try moving it out of that dir ( files in *.d dirs in /etc are all read, you can't stop it)
2007-12-03T11:20:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	do you mean -remove instead of -r? it doesn't understand -r
2007-12-03T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	heh. I'm into aptitude, sudo aptitude purge xvnkb
2007-12-03T11:22:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	thanks, I'll try logging back in and see if that solves my problem
2007-12-03T11:22:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	looks good, that file seems to have been deleted
2007-12-03T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	apt-get remove (I reread the man page;P) will leave files in /etc (in case you had altered them) and --purge will remove them, fyi
2007-12-03T11:24:00.000Z	secret901	nickrud	Yay, it worked.  Thanks for your help.
2008-04-11T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	secret901	there's instructions somewhere on the forums
