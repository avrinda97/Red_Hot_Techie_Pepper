2009-08-18T19:35:00.000Z	kitply		hi everyone, i have detected a security exception. relating to the OS logon password in ubuntu 8.10. i actually typed a wrong login password by omitting a special charecter at the end
2009-08-18T19:35:00.000Z	kitply		but still ubunt was able to log me in
2009-08-18T19:36:00.000Z	kitply		the password with the special charecter and without it at the end works
2009-08-18T19:36:00.000Z	kitply		is nt this a security exception, or is this a know bug in ubuntu
2009-08-18T19:36:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	How long is your password (including the characters)?
2009-08-18T19:36:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	And does the same trick work in console logins?
2009-08-18T19:37:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	it works for synaptic also
2009-08-18T19:37:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	How long is it?
2009-08-18T19:37:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	its about 11 charecters including the final special char
2009-08-18T19:37:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	I have a bad feeling it gets trimmed to a certain length....
2009-08-18T19:38:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	What is that special char?
2009-08-18T19:38:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	it is an exclaimation
2009-08-18T19:39:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	or is it that an exclaimation mark at the end is nullified ..
2009-08-18T19:41:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	It seems to be. I don't know why, though.
2009-08-18T19:41:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	is this a known bug or something. can this be rectified?
2009-08-18T19:42:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	I suggest submitting a bug report in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ because I'm interested too. (There seems to be a limit of 10 characters)
2009-08-18T19:43:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	for another user on the same machine i have a password that is 12 charecters long!
2009-08-18T19:43:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	but it doesnt accept wrong passwords
2009-08-18T19:44:00.000Z	grawity	kitply	What if you use a different character instead of !
2009-08-18T19:44:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	let me try it out
2009-08-18T19:45:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	nope it gives authentication failure. for an @ symbol
2009-08-18T19:45:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	i guess this could be a bug
2009-08-18T20:04:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	i have filed a bug #4154430 in launch pad
2009-08-18T20:05:00.000Z	kitply	grawity	#415430
