2008-05-21T05:51:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	Socialization is for #ubuntu-offtopic, with a channel this big, we unfortunately have to be strict.
2008-06-18T09:06:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	how do i update to the latest VLC, i have tried backports, but my version of VLC wont move beyond 0.8.6e while the latest is 0.8.6h ?
2008-06-18T09:08:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	did you see my message , or it flew up too fast ? :-)
2008-06-18T09:09:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	I did.  Um, -backports won't have it because Intrepid doesn't have it.  Intrepid has the same package version as Hardy currently.  When was the newer version released?
2008-06-18T09:10:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	the new package is two rungs ahead
2008-06-18T09:10:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	we are at 0.8.6e while the latest is 0.8.6h
2008-06-18T09:11:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	Right, and it looks like this version was grabbed in 2007, so, you'll have to ask someone who packages it why it hasn't been updated.  They may have an explanation, or may be able to help.  the MOTU is in charge of it, you can reach them in #ubuntu-motu
2008-06-18T09:12:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	great, let me try MOTU
2008-06-18T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	You may also want to, if you can't reach them, file a bug against the package asking for a newer version
2008-06-18T09:14:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	right... i can
2008-09-22T06:28:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	Try #winehq, they're better at diagnosing/fixing wine things
2008-09-22T06:29:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	you hit the nail on the head.. let me try that channel :-)
2008-09-27T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	there is no package amarok-kde4
2008-09-27T12:05:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	http://ubuntu2.cica.es/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/universe/a/amarok-kde4/
2008-10-27T00:21:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	which is the distro for ubuntu which runs LXDE off the box ? just like xubuntu does for XFCE
2008-10-27T00:22:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	No idea.  It's certainly not an official one.  LXDE isn't even in the repos.
2008-10-27T00:23:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	also have you been using Reiser4 ?
2008-10-27T00:23:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	No
2008-10-27T00:23:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	i am not happy with ext3 performance, its slow... i was thinking of switching to either JFS , reiser3 or reiser4
2009-08-16T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	arbir	Why do you want to separate /usr?
2009-08-16T06:24:00.000Z	arbir	Flannel	better performnace..... we keep writing to /usr
