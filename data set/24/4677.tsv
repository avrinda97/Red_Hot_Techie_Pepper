2007-02-08T08:30:00.000Z	ddude		well hello #ubuntu
2007-02-08T08:31:00.000Z	ddude		my firefox is 'leaking' :(
2007-02-08T08:32:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	which versions of ubuntu and firefox?
2007-02-08T08:32:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	6.10, 2.0.0.1
2007-02-08T08:38:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	disable all your extensions and re-enable them one by one, until you find the culprit
2007-02-08T08:38:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	i have them all disabled now, and still have a [netstat]  <defunct> process
2007-02-08T08:41:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	maybe a plugin is at fault
2007-02-08T08:41:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	disabled all extensions
2007-02-08T08:41:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	is 'about:plugins' an empty page?
2007-02-08T08:42:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	omg
2007-02-08T08:42:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	uhm, no it isn't
2007-02-08T08:42:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	thanks for pointing out
2007-02-08T08:45:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	to do this securely, you'd have to setup a command-specific ssh key
2007-02-08T08:45:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	if you're the only user on your system, you can do 'sudo chmod u+s rmiregistry', then a user can call the command and it will be executed with root permissions
2007-02-08T08:46:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	yeah , the sticky bit, but i think it was for someone else?
2007-02-08T08:47:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	sorry & thanks
2007-02-15T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	try this 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'
2007-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	thanks very very much for responding
2007-02-15T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	you need to reinstall the CiscoVPN modules, whereever you got them from in the first place
2007-02-15T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	no, this is natural. If you install a new kernel, it won't have the extra modules that you got for the old one.
2007-02-15T14:52:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	but i have my old kernel, and there it won't work either, so...
2007-02-15T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	ddude	you've somehow managed to delete parts of your old kernel installation.
2007-02-15T14:52:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	i only clicked update
2007-02-15T14:53:00.000Z	ddude	soundray	and its happened on my 2 laptops and main machine
