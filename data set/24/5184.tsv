2007-02-03T09:09:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		never give up! ;)
2007-02-03T09:09:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		KE: sounds like you may have the mouse set up wrong in your X config file
2007-02-03T09:11:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Cyber: I wouldn't rely on the mods if I did
2007-02-03T09:12:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Lance: are the drives set up in a raid array?
2007-02-03T09:12:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Lance: okay, there goes that idea...
2007-02-03T09:13:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Cyber: ah the joys of win modems... it's why I went external for years
2007-02-03T09:13:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		quick question on Dapper Live Disc installs using dmraid.  When the installer asks me to pick a root partition it only shows the sda devices not the /dev/mapper devices, is that okay?
2007-02-03T09:15:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Cyber:  you should be able to get a serial ide card for dirt cheap these days
2007-02-03T09:16:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		cchanc: whole books are written on samba (windows shares for linux)
2007-02-03T09:17:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		Bob: DOS3.2 was before there was a "decent" windows
2007-02-03T09:19:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	software raid isnt raid on system boards
2007-02-03T09:20:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	are we beginning a semantic argument?
2007-02-03T09:21:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	sure why not.....but raid on a system board is by its existance is Hardware based
2007-02-03T09:22:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	not if it requires drivers to be recognised by the OS, the OS is providing the raid functionality not the bios on the raid controller, true hardware raid makes the array transparant to the OS, it just handles it like a normal drive, no drivers needed, hence on the hardware raid versus using software raid.
2007-02-03T09:23:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	I can agree with that
2007-02-03T09:23:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	depends how old you are if you remember SCSI RAID controllers that handled the RAID through BIOS
2007-02-03T09:23:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	I do
2007-02-03T09:24:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	that's why I use that terminology, it comes from "back in the day"
2007-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	I usually reserve the term software raid for "pure" OS raid, where there is no Raid controller and processor under the covers
2007-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	I guess the difference for me is with "hardware raid" I don't have any trouble installing OS's, but with software raid it's hit F6 or read HowTo Files till you're blue in the face
2007-02-03T09:28:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	the F6 which installs a device driver, isnt strictly Software raid, especially if the driver is acting as the hal for a real raid controller
2007-02-03T09:28:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	that's only in windows... have a read in the Ubuntu wiki "FakeRaidHowTo"
2007-02-03T09:29:00.000Z	Ciaus	M_Cheevy	I install most flavors of OS's, as part of my daily work.....a driver no matter how it gets into an OS if it provides an interface to dedicated hardware, is not software raid
2007-02-03T09:30:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	Ciaus	RAID goes back a ways before HALs
