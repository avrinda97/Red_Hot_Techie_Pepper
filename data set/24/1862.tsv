2009-07-18T16:57:00.000Z	Itty		I have a vm running ubuntu server 9.04, and installled pureftpd on it.  it worked fine until I added two new users. I can still log in as the original admin user but not as the new ones.  Anything special I need to d?
2009-07-18T16:57:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	you mean you can still log into pureftpd as the original user?
2009-07-18T16:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	Add the new users to the pureftpd group using sudo
2009-07-18T16:59:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	Or better, use the GUI under System -> Administration -> Users and Groups
2009-07-18T17:01:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	there has to be a group for your ftp thing
2009-07-18T17:02:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	you just need to find it
2009-07-18T17:03:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	is there a command that shows what groups a user is in instead of looking in /etc/group
2009-07-18T17:03:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	id
2009-07-18T17:13:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	are you still there
2009-07-18T17:14:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	yep
2009-07-18T17:16:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	Are you sure that the user who can use the software and the users who can't are members of the same groups?
2009-07-18T17:17:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	no they are all members of their own user group, 1000 1001 1002
2009-07-18T17:17:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	but all other groups?
2009-07-18T17:19:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	well, don't you want the other users to have the same groups?
2009-07-18T17:19:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	I may delete them and create pureftpd virtual ftp only users
2009-07-18T17:19:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	The user who is able to log in to pureftpd, what does it get when you type group?
2009-07-18T17:22:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	I don't know which one of those makes the difference.  Why don't you just add them all to the new users and see if it makes the difference?
2009-07-18T17:23:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	I will add them one by one and test after each, that way I will know what one fixes it if one does
2009-07-18T17:23:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	I was going to suggest add them all and then subtract them one at a time
2009-07-18T17:26:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	I added all the groups to one of the users and get the same error when connecting with ftp localhost
2009-07-18T17:27:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	can you connect if you sudo from that user account?
2009-07-18T17:27:00.000Z	Itty	richardcavell	nope
2009-07-18T17:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	is your ftp daemon only accepting connections from certain users?
2009-07-18T17:29:00.000Z	richardcavell	Itty	I can't help you further, man.  Good luck with it.
