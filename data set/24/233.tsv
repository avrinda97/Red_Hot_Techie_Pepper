2012-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	Bender__		I have seriuos audio problem, how can I reconfigure my audiocard?
2012-02-20T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	can you give the output of:   wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-02-20T03:12:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	Your ALSA information is in /tmp/alsa-info.txt.5JMYRlsU5k
2012-02-20T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	ok, run:  sudo apt-get install pastebinit; pastebinit /tmp/alsa-info.txt.5JMYRlsU5k      what is output?

2012-02-20T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	does the system have a make and model?
2012-02-20T03:22:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	no sorry, I made this computer by myself
2012-02-20T03:22:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	from scratch
2012-02-20T03:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	so what is your sound issue?
2012-02-20T03:24:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	I have 3 Soundcard: 1st is the motherboard integrated, 2 nd is the videocard HDMI,  3rd is my Soundblaster Live! PCI card. I have disabled the 1st and 2nd. I only wanna work with the SB live. This is the issue: I was recording with the line-in input and then I am unable to switch back to the mic-in input.
2012-02-20T03:24:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	The audio input is locked on line-in so I can't use skype or any other software. Only Line-in input is working.
2012-02-20T03:25:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	I have tryed to change the audio settings but it doesn't work.
2012-02-20T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	Creative cards can be a pain
2012-02-20T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*     then wait a few seconds, see if it helps
2012-02-20T03:25:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	oww..so bad...anyway that card has so low latency
2012-02-20T03:26:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	also the audio quality recording and playback is really great compared to the integrated soundcard.
2012-02-20T03:26:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	is there a way to reset pulseaudio or reconfigure it?
2012-02-20T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	I gave the command to reset it
2012-02-20T03:28:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	where? I only recived the alsa formation script and the pastebin
2012-02-20T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	(22:25:39) ActionParsnip: Bender__: try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*     then wait a few seconds, see if it helps
2012-02-20T03:29:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	thank you, I give a try...
2012-02-20T03:31:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	it works! After that I found my audio settings to be reconfigured (disable the other 2 cards) and unmute the mic-in
2012-02-20T03:31:00.000Z	Bender__	ActionParsnip	solved :) Thank you a lot!
2012-02-20T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bender__	nice. No worries dude
