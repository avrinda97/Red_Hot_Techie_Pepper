2007-06-04T11:00:00.000Z	n2diy		how can I get an iso of Edubuntu? I'm on 56k dial up, and my connection times out every 8 hours? Download Manager won't resume where the connection broke. I'm running Dapper, ideas?
2007-06-04T11:01:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	n2diy	it may be easiest to order a CD from Canonical.
2007-06-04T11:02:00.000Z	n2diy	dawn_chorus	I tried that, and the shipit folk turned me down. I had no problem getting Edgy and Dapper disks, so it is a mystery why they refused to send me Edubuntu?
2007-06-04T11:03:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	n2diy	perhaps for institutions only.  the only difference is a few packages, which you can install onto either Edgy or Dapper.
2007-06-04T11:04:00.000Z	n2diy	dawn_chorus	roger, that, how can I promote it to the local schools, if I can't show it to them?
2007-06-04T11:04:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	n2diy	i see what you mean.  you can always build your own livecd's.
2007-06-04T11:05:00.000Z	n2diy	dawn_chorus	roger that to, have a good howto on that?
2007-06-04T11:06:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	n2diy	there are a few on the web.  there's one on the ubuntu site.  i'll do a search for you.
