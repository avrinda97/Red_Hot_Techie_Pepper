2006-07-04T14:34:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	what is your download speed on average
2006-07-04T14:34:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	3Mbps
2006-07-04T14:34:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	that is what mine is supposed to be
2006-07-04T14:35:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	but im at like 14kb/sec
2006-07-04T14:35:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	well that bites
2006-07-04T14:35:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	is there a charter irc?
2006-07-04T14:36:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	dunno.  they probably have a live support webchat thingy but you won't get much farther than "what OS are you running"
2006-07-04T14:36:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	well right now, windows.
2006-07-04T14:36:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	:(
2006-07-04T14:36:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	then they'll say you've got spyware and tell you to reinstall :D
2006-07-04T14:37:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	 lol i know i dont though. thats whats so funny, maybe its becuase i am in the hills of kentucky
2006-07-04T14:37:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	that could well do it.  it's not unusual to have crappy signal out there and population density makes it not cost-effective to fix
2006-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	you rich?
2006-07-04T14:38:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	i wish
2006-07-04T14:39:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	im not reaching near my bandwidth
2006-07-05T16:30:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	first, find a chicken to sacrifice
2006-07-05T16:31:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	it wont work?
2006-07-05T16:31:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	It might. I had a hard time with mine, so I'm scarred.
2006-07-05T16:33:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	is there any wireless card that will work with it?
2006-07-05T16:33:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	wel if you check the forums I think there's actually a survey on what the best wireless card is.
2006-07-05T16:33:00.000Z	zHack	kaot	ok thanks man
2006-07-05T16:33:00.000Z	kaot	zHack	what I'd recommend is plug the thing in, lspci to get the chipset, then google ubuntu + chipset
