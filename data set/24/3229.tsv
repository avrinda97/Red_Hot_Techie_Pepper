2008-05-16T15:34:00.000Z	Pomin		hei, any body can help me ?
2008-05-16T15:36:00.000Z	Pomin		I upgrade from 7.x -> 8.04 , kernel 2.6.24-16-generic #1 SMP, CPU : Intel E6600 x 2
2008-05-16T15:36:00.000Z	Pomin		but I can only see 2 cpus in 'top' command
2008-05-16T15:37:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	well, it is a dual core
2008-05-16T15:37:00.000Z	Pomin		yeah, so suppose I can see 4 CPUs in 'top'
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	Pomin		but only 2
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	or do you mean you have 2 dual core
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	Pomin		yeah, I have 2 cpus
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	ahh, try   htop
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	may work better
2008-05-16T15:38:00.000Z	Pomin		tried. only 2. :)
2008-05-16T15:39:00.000Z	Pomin		and other info: /proc/cpuinfo is correct
2008-05-16T15:39:00.000Z	Pomin		'lshw' is correct as well, 2 cpus, each with 2 logical-cpus
2008-05-16T15:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	ahh. Well, it may be worth submitting a bug report then
2008-05-16T15:42:00.000Z	Pomin		okay. Thanks. :) anyone other ideas ?
2008-05-16T15:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	only other thing I can suggest is to try the server version
2008-05-16T15:45:00.000Z	Pomin		Distrokockey : ok, Thanks. I will consider about it. ;)
2008-05-16T15:46:00.000Z	Pomin	arex	: 'man find' maybe help, too
2008-05-16T15:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	your real issue is with top as far as I see
2008-05-16T15:48:00.000Z	Pomin		Distrojockey : I hope so. I need the computing power.
2008-05-16T15:49:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	if the /proc info is ok, then you be good to go I think
2008-05-16T15:49:00.000Z	Pomin		top, htop, and GNOME System Monitor all the same. :)
2008-05-16T15:50:00.000Z	Pomin		Thanks, Distrojockey. :-D bye~~
2008-05-16T15:50:00.000Z	DistroJockey	Pomin	later
