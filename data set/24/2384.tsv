2009-01-12T08:39:00.000Z	andresmh		another interesting thing is that when Flash goes gray on Firefox and I open Mozilla Prism it still works on Prism. So it must be an issue with Firefox.
2009-01-12T08:39:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	I use that plugin thing,,,from Mozilla
2009-01-12T08:39:00.000Z	andresmh		what plugin thing vigo?
2009-01-12T08:40:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	No Script,,one sec,,let me look at it
2009-01-12T08:40:00.000Z	andresmh	vigo	ah yes, but how does that help?
2009-01-12T08:40:00.000Z	andresmh		I do want Flash to appear
2009-01-12T08:40:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	Flash Block
2009-01-12T08:41:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	It gives an option to flash,,,is rather handy
2009-01-12T08:42:00.000Z	andresmh	vigo	Flash block will help me if I wanted to block Flash, but my problem is that Flash stops working after a few hours of browsing and I do want Flash to continue working.
2009-01-12T08:43:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	this plugin allows or does not allow, is based on what you decide when flash is wanting to run,,the h2g2 was not working, I installed that, it works fine now.
2009-01-12T08:43:00.000Z	andresmh		what is h2g2?

2009-01-12T08:44:00.000Z	andresmh		do you have by default that it blocks out all the Flash content?

2009-01-12T08:44:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	Yes
2009-01-12T08:45:00.000Z	andresmh		interesting vigo, I'd like it so by default it plays all Flash. do you think that would help?
2009-01-12T08:45:00.000Z	vigo	andresmh	when I visit like youtoob or BBC1,2, I activate or allow it to run
2009-01-12T08:46:00.000Z	andresmh	vigo	did you see on their page Flash Block is having an issue with Firefox from Ubuntu?
