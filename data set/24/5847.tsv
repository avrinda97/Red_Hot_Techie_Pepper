2006-06-08T12:27:00.000Z	__mikem		LimeWire doesn't like my version of the Java RunTIme and frostwire won't install, someone want to suggest another client
2006-06-08T12:28:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Define "won't install."
2006-06-08T12:29:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	wrong choice of words, I mean it can't be found by apt
2006-06-08T12:29:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	You have universe and multiverse repos enabled?
2006-06-08T12:29:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	'Cause I can see it.
2006-06-08T12:29:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	I have ALL repositories enabled in the file. I swear on gods name I have all of them enabled
2006-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Hm... tried sudo apt-get update?
2006-06-08T12:32:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Just checking. ;) Hm... just for fun, try running sudo apt-cache search frostwire from the terminal.
2006-06-08T12:33:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	no results
2006-06-08T12:33:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Jeez... I dunno, dude. That's freaky.
2006-06-08T12:35:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	what do you recomend I do about this?
2006-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Tough call. Only other thing I can recommend is looking on the wiki. http://wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	If you like I can show you my sources list
2006-06-08T12:41:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	That's OK. I wish I knew what to say to help you, but I really don't know. I just that enabling the universe and multiverse repos was enough to make it available to me via synaptic.
2006-06-08T12:42:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	s/I just that e/E
2006-06-08T13:04:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	according to Seveas Frostwire doesn't exist in the ubuntu repositories, what repos are you using?
2006-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	frostwire.org doesn't exist
2006-06-08T13:07:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Sorry, .com

2006-06-08T13:11:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	its complaining about the jre and I have 5.0 installed
2006-06-08T13:11:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Frostwire is?
2006-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Dunno. I'm running 1.5.0_06-b05 and I can run it fine.
2006-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	Elazar	__mikem	Check the wiki page, dude. I don't know. All I know is, I can run it.
2006-06-08T13:22:00.000Z	__mikem	Elazar	it is still complaining about the jre!
