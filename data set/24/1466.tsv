2010-01-02T17:18:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w		can anyone help?
2010-01-02T17:19:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w		what is /dev/pts for?
2010-01-02T17:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	for Pseudo-TerminalS iirc
2010-01-02T17:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	nope sorry; that the only error you get?
2010-01-02T17:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	does it say why it can not mount it?
2010-01-02T17:25:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w	erUSUL	the standard reason, bad superblock or ...
2010-01-02T17:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	well that's really weird becouse /dev/pts is a "virtual filesystem" like proc or sys so how can the superblock be bad? maybe it fails to mount root first and then fails the other mounts becouse of that?
2010-01-02T17:27:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w	erUSUL	maybe, but my root mounts fine under livecd
2010-01-02T17:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	in the livecd no; in the hard disk yes
2010-01-02T17:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	dev gets populated on but by udev
2010-01-02T17:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	see this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/insserv/+bug/321927
2010-01-02T17:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	could be; maybe the conf of udev got screwed or some other config file ...
2010-01-02T17:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	it uses ecryptfs filesystem type; google would be able to tell you what switches to pass to mount
2010-01-02T17:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	here http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7568/3/ <<< explains how to access the encrypted directory from livecd
2010-01-02T17:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	looks easier than i thought
2010-01-02T17:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	managed to acess your data ?
2010-01-02T20:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	folloowed the instructions i give earlier?
2010-01-02T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7568/3/
2010-01-02T20:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	the problem from the livecd could be that the ecryptfs driver was not loaded
2010-01-02T20:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	do « sudo modprobe ecryptfs » to make sure
2010-01-02T20:24:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w	erUSUL	module not found... however, ecryptfs-mount-private returns no errors
2010-01-02T20:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	br0kenarr0w	maybe is compiled in in newer kernels
2010-01-02T20:32:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w	erUSUL	its not working :(
2010-01-02T20:33:00.000Z	br0kenarr0w	erUSUL	ecryptfs-mount-private just returns nothing
