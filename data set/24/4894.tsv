2007-01-03T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	run the cd checker
2007-01-03T17:18:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	?
2007-01-03T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	when you boot it there is an option to check media
2007-01-03T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	boot from the cd and look at the menu options
2007-01-03T17:20:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	why would there be defects, i just got the cd today in the mail
2007-01-03T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	I don't know - just check it
2007-01-03T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	have you done the media check
2007-01-03T17:24:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	yesh, and its clean

2007-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	look at the boot options, try some of the safe modes
2007-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	I told you to install from safe/recovery mode
2007-01-03T17:31:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	i dont know how to do that if you dont tell me
2007-01-03T17:31:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	I did - look at the boot options from the cd
2007-01-03T17:32:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	ok, there is start, safe graphics check memory and boot hd
2007-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	i tried the starrt, i get a freeze, then i tried safe, i get a freeze, i checked for defects, its clean, i did a memory test, its fine, i bootted from hd, theres nothing there
2007-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	tirus89	ikonia	so what now?
2007-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	ikonia	tirus89	got to be honest, I'm losing interest. If its freezing, sounds like a hardware error
