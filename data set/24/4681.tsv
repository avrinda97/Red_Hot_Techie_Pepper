2007-02-21T13:54:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	you can't modprobe an interface
2007-02-21T13:56:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	why do you need to probe the kernel module?
2007-02-21T13:58:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	OK, first thing, slow down. don't go running off probing kernel modules needlessly.
2007-02-21T13:58:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	Ok..
2007-02-21T13:58:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	cat /etc/network/interfaces
2007-02-21T13:58:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	lo ... and?
2007-02-21T14:00:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	what kind of card/chipset is it?
2007-02-21T14:01:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	what is the chipset of the NIC?
2007-02-21T14:02:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	or the mobo model
2007-02-21T14:03:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	got your CD?
2007-02-21T14:04:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	I can actually PING other devices from that computer with that eth0 thing in /interfaces !!!
2007-02-21T14:05:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	ignore GUI tools
2007-02-21T14:05:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	sudo dhclient eth0
2007-02-21T14:07:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	I had to use sudo for it.. it says something like Sending DHCP or something via eth0.. sorry the problematic system is in another room!!
2007-02-21T14:08:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	ifconfig
2007-02-21T14:08:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	does eth0 now have an IP assigned?
2007-02-21T14:11:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	you have a machine handing out DHCP leases, yes?
2007-02-21T14:12:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	 no no.. we se static for all computers
2007-02-21T14:14:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	I can ping other computers from the problem computer, but I can't pint the problem computer from other systems!!
2007-02-21T14:16:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	 The NIC can see local computers.. but not the internet.. this is to summarise the current situation!!
2007-02-21T14:17:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	you need to remove anything you did to /etc/network/interfaces. you then need to install the restricted modules for your kernel.
2007-02-21T14:24:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	what kind of modules?
2007-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	mneptok	hellmet	sudo aptitude install linux-restricted-modules
2007-02-21T14:39:00.000Z	hellmet	mneptok	what do those modules do?
