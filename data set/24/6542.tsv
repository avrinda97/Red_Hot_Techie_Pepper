2008-06-10T07:29:00.000Z	SpudDogg		If I were to install ubuntu on my ps3, is it possible to get it back off and have a factory ps3 again?
2008-06-10T07:30:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	what is it you want to do with Ubuntu on the PS3?
2008-06-10T07:31:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	i watch tons of downloaded content using only XMB on the PS3
2008-06-10T07:31:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 XMB?  googling
2008-06-10T07:32:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	Xross Media Bar. the default PS3 OS.
2008-06-10T07:33:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 how would i access my samba shares?
2008-06-10T07:33:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	you don't. you use MediaTomb.
2008-06-10T07:36:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 this looks like you would just use the ps3 browser to navigate to a share, correct?  the browser in my ps3 is not fullscreen though
2008-06-10T07:37:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	nope, the MediaTomb share shows up as a browseable device on the PS3, like an external USB device.
2008-06-10T07:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 ahh ok...think i should install this on my ubutnu-server fileserver machine or on my gentoo desktop machine?
2008-06-10T07:40:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	Ubuntu server. it's apackaged :)
2008-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 i guess what i was asking is if there's a GUI
2008-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	if you're doing this now, i'll give you the 2 lines you'll need in MediaTomb's .conf to make the PS3 feel sexy.
2008-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 what better time to do it?
2008-06-10T07:41:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	nope. there's a web UI, but it's unrelated to configurstion.
2008-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	what release is the Ubuntu server running?
2008-06-10T07:42:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 its running gutsy for now, i could upgrade it quick if that would be easier
2008-06-10T07:43:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	nope, should be fine
2008-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 well, i've added the repo, im going to install the 3 packages now
2008-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	tell me when it's installed and running and i'll help you edit your config
2008-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 it's installed, but it did not make a ~/.mediatomb directory, nor a config.xml at all
2008-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	it's /etc/mediatomb/config.xml
2008-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	SpudDogg	mneptok	 sure is, lol.  the mediatomb site says its in ~/.mediatomb :/
2008-06-10T07:51:00.000Z	mneptok	SpudDogg	see PM
