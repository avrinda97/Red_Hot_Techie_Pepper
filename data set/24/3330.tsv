2008-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Housefly7k		Hi guys, my brother is trying to install ubuntu, he has 2 Gb of RAM, what size should he make his swap?
2008-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	1gig is more than enough
2008-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	thanks
2008-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	np
2008-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	have him make a seperate /home as well..  he'll be happier later
2008-03-29T06:41:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	he screwed up the installation somehow, and now he cant get into ubunut, recovery or windows
2008-03-29T06:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	are you trying to help him remotely? sounds like grub is messed up.  check out htp://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
2008-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	yeah I am helping him over the phone, sorry for the delayed response i keep flipping between webpages and IRC
2008-03-29T06:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	you got your work cut out for you.. maybe you can ssh into his box running the live cd and get it done for him.. or better yet use vnc (terminal services client)
2008-03-29T06:50:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	yeah, he wasnt able to launch live cd so he went with the alternate cd... I think it may be because he used the 64 bit
2008-03-29T06:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	did you tell him to get the 32bit?
2008-03-29T06:51:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	he just said he went into recovery mode when it did work and reinstalled grub on the windows partition...could this be causing the problems?
2008-03-29T06:52:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	yeah he is currently in the process of reinstalling, so i told him to continue and if it didnt work to get the 32 bit
2008-03-29T06:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	if he has more than one hd then grub needs to be put on the boot drive (main) like the partition that windows is on
2008-03-29T06:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	he'll want the 32 later.. 64 for a noob can be daunting
2008-03-29T06:53:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	no, one hard drive
2008-03-29T06:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	then he shouldn't have an issue getting grub to the right place.. if you have more than one drive it can get weird
2008-03-29T06:54:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	yeah, well hopefully this install will work, if not we'll try the 32 bit livecd, then the 32bit alternate :) But thanks for the help, and if I need more I'll be sure to come back
2008-03-29T06:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	all 1200+ of us are here just waiting to help :)
2008-03-29T07:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	is he dual booting?
2008-03-29T07:17:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	he still has windows on there yeah
2008-03-29T07:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	weird that it sticks there.. might be a bad burn.. he should burn it at the SLOWEST possible speed.. some will say it doesn't matter but I find it does as other have as well.
2008-03-29T07:19:00.000Z	Housefly7k	Scunizi	yeah I am gonna have him download and run the 32 livecd
2008-03-29T07:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	Housefly7k	much better
