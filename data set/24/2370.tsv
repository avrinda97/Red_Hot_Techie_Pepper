2009-01-14T02:34:00.000Z	lorenzosu		how can I compare two directories (and all subdirs). I've read about the dircmp command but not installed on ubunto :/
2009-01-14T02:35:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	Perhaps use diff?
2009-01-14T02:36:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	Like 'diff <(ls dir1) <(ls dir2)'
2009-01-14T02:36:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	thought diff is only for files..
2009-01-14T02:36:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	The '<(command)' creates a temp file filled with the output of 'command'
2009-01-14T02:38:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Not sure I understand.. :/
2009-01-14T02:38:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	Let me find you a link
2009-01-14T02:39:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	What shell do you use?
2009-01-14T02:39:00.000Z	lorenzosu		the default ubuntu 'terminal'
2009-01-14T02:39:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Thansk ;)
2009-01-14T02:39:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	You got it? Here's a link if you need... http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html
2009-01-14T02:43:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Ahh ok... so what output should I expect? If I understand correctly from diff manual, if I get no output the directories are identical
2009-01-14T02:44:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	I don't really know what the output of diff should be, but yes, there will be no output if the directories are identical
2009-01-14T02:44:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	That's just if they have the same filenames.
2009-01-14T02:44:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Ah
2009-01-14T02:45:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	And to check if they are exactly same files? cmp?
2009-01-14T02:45:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	The command I gave you doesn't care whether or not the files are actually the same (i.e. have the same hash).
2009-01-14T02:45:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	You may need to write a more complicated script.
2009-01-14T02:46:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Aww... you know of any utility.. I basically if a backaup wnt well :)
2009-01-14T02:48:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	A quick google doesn't show anything similar...
2009-01-14T02:48:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	I couldn't find a package with dircmp either
2009-01-14T02:48:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Yes I know :(
2009-01-14T02:48:00.000Z	Nomexous	lorenzosu	I think you'll have to write your own script
2009-01-14T02:49:00.000Z	lorenzosu	Nomexous	Ok thanks
