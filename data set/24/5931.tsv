2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	upro		Hi! Someone there to help my with a alsa/timidity problem?
2007-07-29T15:11:00.000Z	upro		Can't open pcm device 'default'.
2007-07-29T15:11:00.000Z	upro		Couldn't open ALSA pcm device (`s')
2007-07-29T15:11:00.000Z	upro		I start it liek this: timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os1l -s 44100
2007-07-29T15:12:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	sounds like ssh is not running on port 22
2007-07-29T15:14:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	what do you keam? How can i find out on which prt ssh is running?
2007-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	ssh runs on port 22, but sometimes people run it on non-standard ports to avoid ssh dos style attacks. For example, on my servers ssh runs on 222
2007-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	where do I find out which port ssh uses?
2007-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	/etc/services confirms ssh on port 22...
2007-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	that only tells you what the standard ports are.
2007-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	so where to find this out?
2007-07-29T15:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	are you trying to connect to your own ssh server?
2007-07-29T15:18:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	not that I knew...
2007-07-29T15:38:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	my /etc/ssh/ssh_config soe not talk about ports...
2007-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	that is the ssh *client*
2007-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	where do I fond the server settings?
2007-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	to specify a port when connecting to a server, use the -p switch. Like this ssh -p 1234 server.example.com
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	you have to install a server first, do you want to run a ssh server (allow other people ability to login to your system) or you just want to connect to other computers via ssh?
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	for timidity I didn't really want to connect to ssh, why should I do that?
2007-07-29T15:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	I don't know -- why are you asking about ssh then?
2007-07-29T15:43:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	You said that my problem looked lie ssh running on a port other than 22, I only asked why timidity won't start here...
2007-07-29T15:45:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	I get this as error message: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
2007-07-29T15:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	upro	what sound card do you have?
2007-07-29T15:47:00.000Z	upro	fyrestrtr	I have a C-Media Electronics Inc CM8738 (rev 10)
