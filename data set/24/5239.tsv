2008-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	okay, trying that.
2008-03-22T13:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	system specs never hurt
2008-03-22T13:08:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	That's just it, I'm still having trouble collecting them.
2008-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf , and change nvidia to nv for now, that should get you a screen.
2008-03-22T13:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	actually, try   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , that will make that change to nv for you, and set up some other stuff for compatibility.
2008-03-22T13:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	yes, it resets the driver to what ubuntu/X thinks is best for your card. The mx400 is a well known, tested card
2008-03-22T13:20:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	booting now.
2008-03-22T13:21:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	Nice blue screen that says, "failed to start the x server"
2008-03-22T13:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	you sure it's an mx400? The nv driver is supposed to support that. Hm. this time, do sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , it should ask you for a driver and resolution. Pick vesa as the driver, and a resolution you are certain the monitor can handle
2008-03-22T13:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	ok. Just I don't remember anyone ever having issues with one.    lspci | grep -i  vga will tell you for sure
2008-03-22T13:27:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	I can't do anything with the card in the slot.  Well, I can go to recovery, but that's it.
2008-03-22T13:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	ah, you have onboard!!!
2008-03-22T13:28:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	um...yeah.
2008-03-22T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	in your bios, disable the onboard.
2008-03-22T13:28:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	can't find it.  i thought of that first.
2008-03-22T13:31:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	oh, and now.... i can't get any image.  i can login, but after usplash, even without card, screen is blank.  but i can log in and get the sounds and everythign.  and the ctrl-alt-backspace and ctrl-alt-f7 don't work
2008-03-22T13:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	with vesa as the driver? I'd bet if you hooked up a monitor to the onboard, you'd see the desktop
2008-03-22T13:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	In your shoes I'd check for arguing video output
2008-03-22T13:35:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	shoes?  I'm a newb
2008-03-22T13:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	if you have two monitors, hook up to both outputs.
2008-03-22T13:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	then switch outputs, and reboot. See what happens
2008-03-22T13:52:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	The vesa thing didn't work.  Took the res down to 600x400
2008-03-22T13:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Thkaal	then I don't know whats up with your system. Normally nvidia is a snap
2008-03-22T13:55:00.000Z	Thkaal	nickrud	well, it is an hp, hecka old.  i'll try flashing the bios and hopefully that'll work.
