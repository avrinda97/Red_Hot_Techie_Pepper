2008-02-26T17:56:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		.. is there a way to detach and reattach to gui apps (like screen, but for X apps) for apps running via SSH -Y? ... (don't want to use VNC becuase that shows the whole desktop, just want the singular remote X app)
2008-02-26T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 not that i have ever seen. I use vncserver, where it spawns its own desktop. it does NOT have to 'share' the current/local desktop
2008-02-26T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 yep. i recall that years ago. it never worked well.
2008-02-26T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 i just make vncserver run a minimal desktop. :) like jwm,  all i run on it is a torrent client i like to remotely access
2008-02-26T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 you can run remote apps and have them appear liocally easially enough.. But the whole 'detatch/reatatch' is the hard bit. :)
2008-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	heh! I am still hunting for a solution to this :)
2008-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	ah ha!!! nohup doesn't work either :)
2008-02-27T06:32:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	 vnc is very nice ... but since I run apps local and remote... I find myself sizing the VNC session to trim-around the application I'm running over VNC so I can continue to work on my local desktop
2008-02-27T06:33:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	yea xmove works about as well as something that doesn't... work ... well..
2008-03-01T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 try asking in ##linux :)
2008-03-01T11:22:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	sure... beggars can't be choosers :-)
2008-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 id like to see how it could be done :)
2008-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	but I'll continue to ask at regular intervals.... you never know when master yoda of the ssh-clan of the clan McCloud should ever waltz in :)
2008-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 go bug all the disrto channels. :) heh heh
2008-03-01T11:25:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	but these days .. Ubuntu is like jupiter with a huge gravitational pull ... all the other distros pale in scale... except maybe fedora/redhat
2008-08-22T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	  wouldent you use /dev/sdh1  instead of /dev/sdh ?
2008-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	the device isn't mounted ........ /dev/sdh1 isn't there (I don't think?)
2008-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	when i try it with /dev/sdh1 I get "Command failed: Can't get device information." (I dont think it exists)
2008-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 check with 'sudo fdisk -l' and see whats there I guess. normally /dev/sdh would be like a cdrom drive. a fileysstem is normally on /dev/sdh#
2008-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 sdh may be totally wrong. but ive not used your specific tool. so i may be confused.
2008-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	checking now....
2008-08-22T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Bossmanbeta	 try mounting someplace else perhaps like /media/test peraps.
2008-08-22T06:45:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	that doesn't work, even if I "sudo mkdir /media/encrytped1" then try " sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdh /media/encrypted1" it still says "Command failed: dm_task_set_name: Device /media/encrypted1 not found'
2008-08-22T06:46:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Dr_willis	I think you may be right on the sdh1 part........ but when I insert the USB stick, /dev/sdh1 doesn't appear.............
