2010-04-30T05:19:00.000Z	hmw	sender	if you need to protect your data, use encryption.
2010-04-30T05:20:00.000Z	sender	hmw	I know, but it seems that even windows is better protected ...
2010-04-30T05:20:00.000Z	hmw	sender	that's quite not so shocking, its how it ought to be. i can access windows, too, if it isnt encryped, from any live cd.
2010-04-30T05:21:00.000Z	sender	hmw	melkor, true, but a reboot and direct root access is even more convenient..
2010-04-30T05:21:00.000Z	hmw	sender	See it this way: this is only reminding you, that you forgot to use encryption.
2010-04-30T05:26:00.000Z	hmw	sender	melkor: setting a root password results in a prompt in recovery mode. But that is still almost "no-security" unless you use encryption.
2010-04-30T05:26:00.000Z	sender	hmw	well, it's not easy to crack that password is it?
2010-04-30T05:27:00.000Z	hmw	sender	i put in a live cd or my usb thumb drive and have full access without a password at all
2010-04-30T05:33:00.000Z	hmw	sender	having no password for root makes it impossible to log in as root via ssh
2010-04-30T05:34:00.000Z	sender	hmw	so you are saying that having no password for root is actually a security improvement?
2010-04-30T05:34:00.000Z	hmw	sender	in the case of Ubuntu, yes. They had a reason to do it this way.
2010-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	hmw	sender	there is simply no reason to let anyone log in as the system (aka root)
2010-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	hmw	sender	there is no reason to log in as the system (aka root). it would be just another possible security hole.
2010-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	hmw	sender	if you want security, either hide GRUB totally (0 seconds delay) or use another boot loader. Physical access = no protection. period.
2010-04-30T05:44:00.000Z	hmw	sender	not having a root account is even better
2010-04-30T05:49:00.000Z	sender	hmw	acicula: lol. So you guys think that it's not a gain in security that having a password on root will stop anybody encountering a physical ubuntu system (say in the library) to login as root?
2010-04-30T05:50:00.000Z	sender	hmw	acicula: or not having grub boot into root by default, for that matter.
2010-04-30T05:51:00.000Z	hmw	sender	1) not having a password on root means nobody can login as root. That is better than having a password and allowing people to log in. 2) Ubunut decided to have it this way. Swallow it. 3) This is offtopic, please continue on #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-04-30T05:54:00.000Z	sender	hmw	Not a biggie, since I know - I'll set up a password for root in no time. But I others should know. Btw, you know that 1) is not true. That's why I've brought this up.
2010-04-30T05:55:00.000Z	hmw	sender	we already told you: encryption.
2010-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	hmw	sender	a BIOS password might be an additional layer of (pseudo) security
2010-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	hmw	sender	encryption stops everyting
2010-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	sender	hmw	lol
