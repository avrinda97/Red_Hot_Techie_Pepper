2010-09-25T09:30:00.000Z	slooksterpsv		Roasted - I think I've heard of this issue before
2010-09-25T09:30:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	which, the password thing?
2010-09-25T09:32:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	Roasted	try to send yourself a message (the send message button) then try to use your password to login again
2010-09-25T09:32:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	you serious?
2010-09-25T09:32:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	*crosses fingers*
2010-09-25T09:39:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	about 700gb.
2010-09-25T09:39:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	I had a 500gb drive and upgraded to a 1TB drive
2010-09-25T09:39:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	I copied my etc /passwd group and shadow file from my old install.
2010-09-25T09:40:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	Roasted	ok... umm.. why, if I may ask
2010-09-25T09:40:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	I didnt see an issue with it, as it was directed by numerous people here to back up my users and reimport them, but then this issue came about
2010-09-25T09:40:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	my system has a bunch of family members on it through samba, so I wanted to transfer them instead of readding them since linux uses UID numbers per account
2010-09-25T09:40:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	so if I readd them, suddenly if 1002 was curtis before, it could be tyler this time, screwing up perms BIGTIME
2010-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	so I wanted to retain the user vs UID, so I backed them up as was directed by many here. then I jsut imported them via gksudo nautilus on my new install
2010-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	should be. I was the first user on both systems.
2010-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	what if I just delete my acct and re-add it?
2010-09-25T09:42:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	I have a backup drive even if it does. Ive been burned enough times already :P
2010-09-25T09:42:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	Roasted	ok perfect then =P I do the same; so yeah try that, could be something faulty with your user in the passwd file
2010-09-25T09:44:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	Roasted	yeah I just tried to add a user to my passwd file and it failed, so I'm going to try and su into the user and change its password
2010-09-25T10:00:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	fixed it.
2010-09-25T10:00:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	the /etc/shadow file needs 640 perms. I had that. I didnt take notice tha my work laptop (10.04 64 bit) was root:shadow, whereas my desktop was root:root.
2010-09-25T10:00:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	when I copied the files over, I was in gksudo nautilus, so it assigned root:root. Doh!
2010-09-25T10:00:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	just chown'd to root:shadow and bingo bango - worked.
2010-09-25T10:01:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	Roasted	wow, yeah I would have not through to check that, I'll remember that
2010-09-25T10:01:00.000Z	Roasted	slooksterpsv	its something I should have picked up on, but when I ran ls -l in the /etc dir, EVERYTHING Was root:root EXCEPT shadow. I didnt even notice even tho it should have stuck out.
