2005-07-29T08:06:00.000Z	fuzzyme		Hi! I think I have a peculiar prob. with ubuntu.. Can anybody help?
2005-07-29T08:07:00.000Z	fuzzyme		I don't see many of the things people seem to see in synaptic...
2005-07-29T08:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	you may not have all the repositories enabled
2005-07-29T08:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	you just won't get backports with that one, which you may want.
2005-07-29T08:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	err, yeah. Ubuntu Universe/Multiverse repositories are on the net
2005-07-29T08:10:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	Is KDE installed with ubuntu?
2005-07-29T08:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	no, but it is with Kubuntu. You can easily install it from Ubuntu with a net connection
2005-07-29T08:11:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	:-( net connection is my CHIEF problem with ubuntu
2005-07-29T08:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	why isn't it working? What's the prob?
2005-07-29T08:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	is that computer not on a network?
2005-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	oh :S. You might still be able to get it running, though personally I think it's easily worth just getting a router
2005-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	well, router? what's it?
2005-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	it's kind of a modem and a hub combined. It stays always connected to the net, and you just plug up any computers to it to get the connection
2005-07-29T08:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	they're cheap too
2005-07-29T08:15:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	No, I have the driver for the WinModem(though it's a miniscule 14.4 one). Yet, it's not working...
2005-07-29T08:15:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	I'm gonna buy a new external modem but for the present?
2005-07-29T08:16:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	no point getting just a modem when you can get a router, really
2005-07-29T08:16:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	how much will that cost?
2005-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	not much. They're around 35 here
2005-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	where?
2005-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	it doesn't connect to the net as conventional modems; it's always connected, and so any computer you can just plug up and it connects
2005-07-29T08:18:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	of course, big advantage is taht it's a hub, too
2005-07-29T08:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	fuzzyme	GBP
2005-07-29T08:19:00.000Z	fuzzyme	apokryphos	Sorry, but what's GBP? Which country?
