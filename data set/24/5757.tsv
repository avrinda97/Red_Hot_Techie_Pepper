2006-05-20T16:13:00.000Z	Drac|Mac		I've noticed that with several very different computers and very different harddrives that Ubuntu, using reiserfs, tends to make a drive randomly reset and spin back up. Has anyone else experienced this? It doesn't seem to really affect that actual system, apart from a brief second of lag on occasion.
2006-05-20T16:14:00.000Z	Drac|Mac		This has never happened to me in other distros.
2006-05-20T16:14:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	using dapper or breezy?
2006-05-20T16:14:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	Breezy only. I have a number of Dapper systems that don't have this problem.
2006-05-20T16:17:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	have a look in /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf under "hard drive behaviour settings". maybe there is a power-saving setting there that is messing it up (for example, a 2 second time out before the HDD spins down instead of a more sane setting)
2006-05-20T16:18:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	Alright. I'll take a look.
2006-05-20T16:18:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	I don't have laptop mode installed.
2006-05-20T16:19:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	well, that counts that out at least :) so an acpi setting? where are those located again... hmm...
2006-05-20T16:19:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	I could go through xscreensaver's GUI. :P
2006-05-20T16:20:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	not a sign of that being in xscreensaver's thing. Anywhere else I can check?
2006-05-20T16:21:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	/etc/acpi something.... but I honestly thought it was the laptop-mode causing this (had that prob two weeks ago)
2006-05-20T16:22:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	you may find that it wasn't that for you, either. :P
2006-05-20T16:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	laptop-mode.conf solved it for me, but it might be another cause for you it seems. sorry if I'm a bit vague
2006-05-20T16:23:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	not a problem.
2006-05-20T16:53:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	i thought of something, if it isn't sorted yet. there is also possibility to install "gnome-power-manager" and set HDD timeouts in there.
2006-05-20T05:14:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	thanks for the tip. I'll look into that.
2006-05-20T05:28:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	I forgot to mention that it did this even when the machine was very active...
2006-05-20T05:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	then I have to say I don't really know what's going on
2006-05-22T16:03:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	do you have at least 3gb free space on / ?
2006-05-22T16:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	or is this before the install has begun?
2006-05-22T16:04:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	this is before.
2006-05-22T16:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	did you burn the cd yourself? is the md5sum ok?
2006-05-22T16:05:00.000Z	Drac|Mac	Jowi	I've used two copies, the md5sum is fine, and I used the same CD to install Ubuntu on this later model iMac.
2006-05-22T16:06:00.000Z	Jowi	Drac|Mac	then I do not know
