2008-07-24T08:00:00.000Z	crashsystems		﻿@michael__ what do you mean?
2008-07-24T08:02:00.000Z	crashsystems		﻿@michael__ that is strange
2008-07-24T08:03:00.000Z	crashsystems		﻿﻿@michael__ does that vary any from one test to another?
2008-07-24T08:04:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	yes, a little. the 250 sata one. result in 56mb/s. the 80 pata old one, result in 57mb/s. a little quick??
2008-07-24T08:00:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	i have a question about that. seemly, it cant give me a true result.
2008-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	as i said.  i have two disk. one maxtor 80G pata, i buy it at 2004, other 250 sata, i buy it 2007.
2008-07-24T08:02:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	i use the command to test both. but it showed me almost same result.
2008-07-24T08:03:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	yes, it showed me both 57mb/s
2008-07-24T08:05:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	but if i test both in windows. the 250 one. result in 58mb/s. the 80 pata, result in 17mb/s
2008-07-24T08:06:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	ext3
2008-07-24T08:07:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	yes
2008-07-24T08:08:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	but the 250 disk, both in window and in linux, the test result same.
2008-07-24T08:09:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	yes, agree that.
2008-07-24T08:10:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	when i test the hard disk, just time a big file move. i get result 17mb/s.
2008-07-24T08:10:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	linux
2008-07-24T08:10:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	so maybe i think the hdparm dont give me a true result.
2008-07-24T08:12:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	one month ago i use the hdparm command to chang some parmeter on my 250 hardisk. and finally i broken it.
2008-07-24T08:12:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	no i am not have a check, i am from china, and i cant suffer that website.
2008-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	so now i have to buy another one. and i use my old 80g disk. and when i get the result in 57mb/s of it. why i buy another one? serious problem.
2008-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	so where are you from?
2008-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	china town?
2008-07-24T08:16:00.000Z	michael__	crashsystems	yes, a cool country. so will you come to beijing for the world's sport game.
