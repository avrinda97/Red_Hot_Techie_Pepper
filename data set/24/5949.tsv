2006-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	sure
2006-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	i'm not getting any pms from you, but that might just be because i don't understand irssi
2006-11-20T13:18:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	because i'm lazy
2006-11-20T13:22:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	can you just unmount AUDIO and then mount it again with -o rw?
2006-11-20T13:23:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	type df to see where it's mounted
2006-11-20T13:23:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	then unmount it, and mount it again rw
2006-11-20T13:24:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	look in the Filesystem column
2006-11-20T13:25:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	the one with the right name in "mounted on"
2006-11-20T13:26:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	no idea.  it doesn't, like, appear on your desktop or something?
2006-11-20T13:27:00.000Z	bitwiseshiftleft	ReWT_AxS	well, i don't know how to fix sd card reader drivers... google for it or something
