2010-08-13T05:53:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 I think control disconnected
2010-08-16T19:24:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 sorry
2010-08-16T19:32:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	there's only so much "engineering bandwidth" to fix stuff, if you really need something, roll up your sleeves and get it done or pay someone to do it
2010-08-16T19:33:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 they can't look at it that it works in debian and use that as a guide?
2010-08-16T19:33:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 I didn't think it would be a complicated issue...
2010-08-16T19:33:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	did you point that out to them?
2010-08-16T19:34:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 yes... :-/
2010-08-16T19:34:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 yes, I pointed that out
2010-08-16T19:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	what package is it?
2010-08-16T19:34:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 I sent pastepins of the output ...whatever was requested
2010-08-16T19:35:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 I was suggested to try 10.10 ..and a daily build but i don't want to install it... I would try a live 10.10 though
2010-08-16T19:35:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	what package is it?
2010-08-16T19:36:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 which one?
2010-08-16T19:36:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	that has the issue fixed in debian
2010-08-16T19:36:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 one bug is the terminal titlebar
2010-08-16T19:38:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 the package is related to ehci_hcd
2010-08-16T19:39:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	link to bug report?
2010-08-16T19:42:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 anyway, if I have to abandon pursuing the issue... I'll let it go... I would like to help solve the bug but yes, my hardware is in bad shape
2010-08-30T17:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	fix it yourself or switch a distro of your liking, it's Free software
2010-08-30T17:18:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 yes, I will be switching
2010-08-30T17:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	farewell then
2010-08-30T17:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	are you paying them to fix it? are you compensating them for their time and effort?
2010-08-30T17:22:00.000Z	eztop	ilovefairuz	 so even though there's no problem with debian or mint... the devs need extra money to track it down?  i would rather switch distros but thanks for the remark
2010-08-30T17:23:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	eztop	they are swamped with issues, so eventually this or that issue will get overlooked
