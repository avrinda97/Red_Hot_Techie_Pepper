2010-05-10T10:37:00.000Z	Roasted		dear ubuntu users. Can anybody help me understand what the basic differences are between simply sharing a folder in nautilus (whcih requires samba) as opposed to editing the shares accordingly in your smb.conf file via samba?
2010-05-10T10:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	i don't know. there might now be any difference. if they do the same thing, there's no difference

2010-05-12T23:50:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	thanks!
2010-05-13T09:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	are you getting an error message? paste it in if you can.
2010-05-13T09:45:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	Im helping my cousin on kubuntu remotely. When he does ANYTHING in kpackagekit it errors out and says you have broken dependencies, please resolve them with an advanced program like synaptic. Problem is, I cant install synaptic.
2010-05-13T09:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	you can read man pages about commands. you would usually use commands like, apt-get, aptitude, dpkg, ect
2010-05-13T09:46:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	yeah, wasnt there one like sudo dpkg configure -a?
2010-05-13T09:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	tru using aptitude
2010-05-13T09:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	or try...   apt-get -f install
2010-05-13T09:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	sudo apt-get -f install
2010-05-13T09:49:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	that command didnt work.
2010-05-13T09:50:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	what about sudo dpkg --configure -a
2010-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	that would do all packages?
2010-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	nvm.. looks good. try it
2010-05-13T09:52:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	hold that thought - he goofed the command originally. it might work yet
2010-05-13T09:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	ok. roger. no worries
2010-05-13T10:07:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	that worked. the -f install.
2010-05-13T10:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	you're welcome. cheers :-)
2010-05-15T01:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	probably because there's no similar permissions/users file permissions in windows... so samba is doing something like handing you the file with such settings. then you have to manually change them with chown/chmod commands
2010-05-15T01:24:00.000Z	Roasted	onetinsoldier	I shouldn't have to do that. I have a samba server at home that doesn't behave this way. I am saving files to my network share, but my network share has the group set (chmod g+s) as "samba" not lpadmin.
2010-05-15T01:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	oh.. i see. there may be a way to do it then. i didn't know. keep asking. sorry
2010-05-15T01:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	sounds like 'line printer' admin, hehe
2010-05-21T22:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Roasted	what's happening? is something constantly spitting a message out at you? btw, i know nothing about wireless
