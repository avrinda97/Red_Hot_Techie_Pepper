2011-06-09T12:46:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	eth1 and wlan0 are both in the same subnet? eth1 is set as default-route when active or has the higher metric?
2011-06-09T12:48:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	check "route -n" and "ifconfig" if both ifaces are active.
2011-06-09T12:49:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	basically: without further configuration, you cannot have wifi  + ethernet  active at the same time in the same subnet
2011-06-09T12:50:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	This is it: http://paste.ubuntu.com/622374/ (of course, with the lines in /etc/network/interfaces commented out). Further configurtion? So it is possible, right?
2011-06-09T12:51:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	you want to use google with "ethernet bonding howto" :)
2011-06-09T12:57:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	Don't understanding what Ethernet Bonding does...
2011-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	it might increase bandwidth in some situations. with wifi+ethernet the benefits would be minimal, so don't waste time to set it up. just make sure not to activate your ethernet while wifi is active
2011-06-09T13:02:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	depends on your network-layout
2011-06-09T13:04:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	you might add "allow-hotplug eth1" and "up ifconfig wlan0 down" "down ifconfig wlan0 up" statements to your /e/n/interfaces. But i'm not sure if that will work when mixing ifupdown and networkmanager.
2011-06-09T13:05:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	imo you should use only 1 method to configure your network, either ifupdown (/e/n/interfaces) OR network-manager
2011-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	How do I disable the network manager?
2011-06-09T13:07:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	use sysv-rc-conf (needs to be installed) to disable networkmanager start
2011-06-09T13:07:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	I guess if I change the subnet of eth1, it won't conflict with network manager?
2011-06-09T13:07:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	it shouldn't
2011-06-09T13:08:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	but you cannot easily change subnet for ifaces, they were given by your router/lan-layout
2011-06-09T13:09:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	so using 192.168.100.xx won't work in your 192.168.1.0/24 network
2011-06-09T13:09:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	if you use it only for network-boot, you don't need to configure it at all
2011-06-09T13:10:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	?
2011-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	your pc acts as bootp-server?
2011-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	I don't use 'bootp'.
2011-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	how do you "network-boot then?
2011-06-09T13:13:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	My PC acts as a DHCP server.
2011-06-09T13:14:00.000Z	llutz_	Shikhin	i'm afraid i lost you. try changing subnet, if it works for your,, fine...
2011-06-09T13:27:00.000Z	Shikhin	llutz_	Fixed it simple by changing the subnet (to 10.0.0.0)
