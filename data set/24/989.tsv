2010-09-21T05:11:00.000Z	storm_zen		Is there a way to restart sound in lucid when it boots without it working?
2010-09-21T05:12:00.000Z	storm_zen		I thought I had tried that... I'll give it a shot, though.
2010-09-21T05:14:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Did that work? Otherwise I can offer more assistance.
2010-09-21T05:14:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Are you using PulseAudio?
2010-09-21T05:15:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	Yes.
2010-09-21T05:15:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	In terminal, type in 'killall pulseaudio'. Then press Alt+F2 and type in 'pulseaudio'.
2010-09-21T05:16:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	That doesn't need sudo?
2010-09-21T05:16:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	killall shouldn't.
2010-09-21T05:18:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	That didn't work, either.
2010-09-21T05:18:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	What are you trying to play audio from?
2010-09-21T05:20:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Hm... can you hear audio from any other programs?
2010-09-21T05:20:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	No idea.  .. like what?
2010-09-21T05:20:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Try a YouTube video, see if that works.
2010-09-21T05:22:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	nope.
2010-09-21T05:23:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Hm.. I used to have an issue when I was programming in Java, that if Java used sound, it destroyed my sound until I rebooted. Have you used any Java applications?
2010-09-21T05:24:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	Not on purpose.
2010-09-21T05:25:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	I could not tell you what the problem is then. Sorry storm_zen. But it could be an older hardware issue, since you said that you have had this issue for three years.
2010-09-21T05:26:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	perhaps.  It if is, though, then it happened with a fairly new Intel board ( at the time ), with the onboard sound, and then with the Turtle Beach soundcard that I bought to get around the 'new unsupported hardware' problem...
2010-09-21T05:27:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	Thanks for your attention.  I guess I'll just reboot now.
2010-09-21T05:27:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Sorry again. It actually might be an issue with the actually application also.
2010-09-21T05:27:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	It could be hogging all of the audio, and then crashing your card.
2010-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	storm_zen	ryen	If that were the case, then it happens before I purposely run anything requiring sound.
2010-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Don't know what to say. Good luck though.
2010-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	ryen	storm_zen	Night, and good luck.
