2007-03-09T14:27:00.000Z	Joshooa		If I can find /lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt61pci.ko, with modprobe, and rt61 is my wireless card chipset, does that mean I have a driver for it, and wouldn't need ndiswrapper?
2007-03-09T14:29:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	then it is working
2007-03-09T14:30:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	But that's not my point, I'm trying to 1 Make sure it will work without ndiswrapper after I reinstall, and also help someone get another wireless card working, and I found his chipset .ko on my computer, but it's not on his
2007-03-09T14:30:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	if you have a kernel module, you probably don't need to use ndiswrapper
2007-03-09T14:35:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	the .ko files come with the kernel that you have installed, if your friend has the same kernel he/she should have the same kernel modules
2007-03-09T14:38:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Thank you we found it on his, not sure why modprobe didn't find it for him, but his wireless card is listed under eth1, is that right?
2007-03-09T14:39:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	And is also unassociated
2007-03-09T14:40:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	that seems good. if it doesn't auto-associate you can set the wireless settings with iwconfig, and do dhcp with dhclient
2007-03-09T14:41:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	How do you make it associate?
2007-03-09T14:42:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	something like this: iwconfig eth1 essid name_of_wireless_network key wep_hex_key_here
2007-03-09T14:43:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Okay, but why is it unassociated, shouldn't it say the wireless card name in that spot?
2007-03-09T14:43:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	And why is wireless on eth, I thought eth was wired
2007-03-09T14:44:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	somehow udev/iwconfig and the module collude to pick an interface name, i'm not sure how
2007-03-09T14:44:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	in the unassociated spot it should say the wireles network you have associated with
2007-03-09T14:45:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	I thought that's what ESSID was
2007-03-09T14:45:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	yeah it is, i guess i was confused about where it was displaying not associated
2007-03-09T14:46:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Ok, yeah unassociated it after eth1 but before essid
2007-03-09T14:46:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	How can i make it recognize that driver file we found earlier?
2007-03-09T14:47:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	it is already loaded, if it wasn't the interface wouldn't be in iwconfig at all
2007-03-09T14:47:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	i think you need to do dhclient now
2007-03-09T14:48:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Okay, it's otateossian that I am helping with this, but I have a similiar issue with a different card
2007-03-09T14:49:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Mine says my card name though, and it's under ra0 not eth1
2007-03-09T14:49:00.000Z	Joshooa	eck	Would depmod be of any help?
2007-03-09T14:51:00.000Z	eck	Joshooa	maybe, i'm not sure
