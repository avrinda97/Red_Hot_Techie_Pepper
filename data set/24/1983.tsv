2009-11-26T21:21:00.000Z	zortec		I should leave it running for a while
2009-11-26T21:21:00.000Z	zortec		my connection is ADSL
2009-11-26T21:22:00.000Z	zortec		are the chances of it having problems likely? I kind of want a best guess answer on this :)
2009-11-26T21:22:00.000Z	zortec		I have read on the ubuntu forum that people had a lot of problems upgrading
2009-11-26T21:23:00.000Z	zortec		now I am kind of mixed up, is it a good idea to upgrade or just keep jaunty and wait for 10.04 to come out?
2009-11-26T21:24:00.000Z	zortec		I want the power of ext4 and grub2 though... which is what I thought you get when you upgrade to karmic
2009-11-26T21:24:00.000Z	zortec		but then I was told you only get it if you do a clean install
2009-11-26T21:25:00.000Z	zortec		I'm torn between an upgrade/fresh install/or just leave 9.04 and wait until april to upgrade again
2009-11-26T21:26:00.000Z	zortec		how does empathy compare to pidgin or do I want to know?
2009-11-26T21:27:00.000Z	zortec		does ext4 give you a 5-10% performance boost in file operations?
2009-11-26T21:28:00.000Z	KaiForce	zortec	file system performance is a function of workload
2009-11-26T21:29:00.000Z	zortec	KaiForce	I thought it was a function of your filesystem and the type of hard drive you have such as scsi, sata, or and if you are using a raid system
2009-11-26T21:29:00.000Z	KaiForce	zortec	 hardware aside
2009-11-26T21:29:00.000Z	KaiForce		by that I mean apart from your hardware
2009-11-26T21:30:00.000Z	zortec		you can still use empathy in 9.04 right?  I know it's usually not advised to mix gnome and kde apps because you get a slow system
2009-11-26T21:30:00.000Z	zortec		so I try to stick with just exclusively gnome or kde, not both
2009-11-26T21:31:00.000Z	zortec		of course the last impression I had of kde when I used it was that there was too much fireworks and it really got in your way of being productive, maybe that changed in 9.10
2009-11-26T21:32:00.000Z	KaiForce		how are the reviews of karmic?  I like what I've seen so far
2009-11-26T21:33:00.000Z	zortec		has canonical released any info on what will be in 10.04 and what the codename is?
2009-11-26T21:33:00.000Z	zortec		I know it is really early :)
2009-11-26T21:34:00.000Z	zortec		Karmic Koala is a cool name but Lucid Lynx... hmm wonder about those names
2009-11-26T21:34:00.000Z	zortec		they say there is a lot to be said in a name
2009-11-26T21:34:00.000Z	KaiForce	zortec	 how is karmic koala any cooler than lucid lynx?
2009-11-26T21:35:00.000Z	zortec	KaiForce	maybe I just have an affinity for koalas
