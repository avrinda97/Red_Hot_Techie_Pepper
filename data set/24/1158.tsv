2010-11-03T05:21:00.000Z	pr0xy		can't I just do like nomodeset and pass the graphicsy poop from nvidia cards?
2010-11-03T05:22:00.000Z	pr0xy		It's the crap that nomodeset gets past. Exactly that.
2010-11-03T05:22:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	you trying to get an nvidia card working?
2010-11-03T05:24:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	google PPA nvidia-vpau and when you go to that link it will give you another link for the latest nvidia drivers.. add the second links PPA to your repository list.. (instructions on the site)
2010-11-03T05:24:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	don't use envy.. gad I haven't heard that in month..
2010-11-03T05:25:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	the ppa works awesome/fine ..
2010-11-03T05:28:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	you have "no" gui right now?
2010-11-03T05:28:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	k.. hang on.. I'll get a link you can use with wget
2010-11-03T05:31:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	type the following... sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
2010-11-03T05:32:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	sorry.. boot the macine normally.. the graphics display will be screwed up like normal or black.. you should be able to CTRL+ALT+F2 and get to a TTY login prompt.. that's where you type it.
2010-11-03T05:34:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	try it a couple times in a row.. if that doesn't work boot to the rescue kernel.
2010-11-03T05:35:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	I saw you mentioned "nomodset".. did you try that?
2010-11-03T05:38:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	someone mentioned earlier how to get to the kernel line on boot.. I've forgotten.. however once there at the end of the line you'll see "quiet splash" .. just before those two words you type in nomodset in lower case.. then hit enter to continue the boot process.
2010-11-03T05:40:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	with nomodset?
2010-11-03T05:40:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	you're not done yet.. was that with nomodset?
2010-11-03T05:41:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	np.. now do the other line I gave you about sudo add-apt etc etc
2010-11-03T05:42:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	if you want the newest drivers do the line I mentioned.
2010-11-03T05:43:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	no.. the line I gave you will add a repository that has the newest driver.. once added type this.. sudo apt-get update .. then go to system>admin>hardware drivers and choose "current version"
2010-11-03T05:43:00.000Z	pr0xy	izinucs	what's the command one?
2010-11-03T05:44:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	type the following... sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
2010-11-03T05:46:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	that added a repository that you're computer will use for vid driver updates..
2010-11-03T05:46:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	now .. sudo apt-get update
2010-11-03T05:46:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	yes.. *new* version drivers
2010-11-03T05:47:00.000Z	izinucs	pr0xy	go for it.. dinner calls.. System>admin>hardware drivers to activate them
