2007-03-18T12:40:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	how are things messed up?
2007-03-18T12:41:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	how did you start beryl? with a custom session script?
2007-03-18T12:42:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	how about starting it with gnome-session? (WAG: you're using KDE)
2007-03-18T12:43:00.000Z	kraypius	Rooy	http://pastebin.ca/399775
2007-03-18T12:47:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	on this site, your same arguments to Xsession is used with exec http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Edgy_with_XGL
2007-03-18T12:47:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	and on this one xession is used only with gnome-session as argument http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Dapper_with_XGL
2007-03-18T12:49:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	try removing "dbus-launch --exit-withsession" part
2007-03-18T12:49:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	i'm on nvidia, not xgl, can't test that out
2007-03-18T12:52:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	have you start beryl-manager?
2007-03-18T12:53:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	rightclick the beryl icon and see what's selected in "window manager"
2007-03-18T12:54:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	select Beryl there
2007-03-18T12:54:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	:)
2007-03-18T12:56:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	for academic purpose, try replace "Xsession gnome-session" with "dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session" :)
2007-03-18T12:59:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	i can;t test it (nvidia card), just curious out of academic sense
2007-03-18T12:59:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	you know, many ways to do one thing
2007-03-18T13:01:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	ok, just skip that, start customising your experience!! :D
2007-03-18T13:12:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	wierd, last time i use emerald, just clicking on one applies it instantly
2007-03-18T13:16:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	you can select GTK window decorator
2007-03-18T13:16:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	back to orange :)
2007-03-18T13:18:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	left a message on #beryl and someone will get attention, i'm not sure that's the way it works
2007-03-18T13:18:00.000Z	Rooy	kraypius	yesterday lupine_85 was really helpful for me on #beryl
