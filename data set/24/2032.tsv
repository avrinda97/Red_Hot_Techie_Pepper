2009-05-28T02:37:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Hrm, reboot in the recovery kernel ?
2009-05-28T02:37:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Reboot, (press escape if necessary to show the GRUB menu), select the kernel that has (recovery mode) or similar after it and press enter...
2009-05-28T02:55:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	it wants me to enter a command
2009-05-28T02:56:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Ah, vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-28T02:58:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	 black screen. "New directory" at the bottom
2009-05-28T02:59:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Hm... :q!
2009-05-28T02:59:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	If you've booted into recovery mode, that's not relevant now...
2009-05-28T02:59:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	if i can enter my system i can remove the fglrx
2009-05-28T03:00:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Has vim closed now and are you back at a $ prompt?
2009-05-28T03:01:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	or infact a # prompt, thinking about it
2009-05-28T03:01:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	pressing buttons does nothing but beep beep beeep
2009-05-28T03:01:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	no prompt
2009-05-28T03:01:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	ok, this is kinda ugly but do a Ctrl+Z
2009-05-28T03:02:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	ok desktop prompt
2009-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	kill %1 (to cleanup that vim session we've left laying around)
2009-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Then tell me if ls /etc/X11 lists a file called xorg.conf ?
2009-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	ahhh what?
2009-05-28T03:03:00.000Z	richard_	kmdm	over my head
2009-05-28T03:04:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Hm, ok, in the command type (without the quotes): "ls /etc/X11/"
2009-05-28T03:04:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Does some text appear saying "xorg.conf" ?
2009-05-28T03:08:00.000Z	kmdm	richard_	Hmmm! odd.
