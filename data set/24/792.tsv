2011-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	you need to list the partitions not the device itself
2011-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	try fdisk -l /device name

2011-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	in your command you need to put the 1 not mount -t ntfs-3g isw_iageihica_Data /media/intelraid, try mount -t ntfs-3g isw_iageihica_Data1 /media/intelraid
2011-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	sorry looks like u did already
2011-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	hmmm
2011-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	this is the problem, not sure why it doesnt think its ntfs, you may need to change the partition label type to NTFS
2011-01-15T07:42:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	what label does it have for fdisk, u might need to re-label it as NTFS
2011-01-15T07:43:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	How would I check that again?
2011-01-15T07:45:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	you have it set to hidden NTFS, not sure that is right
2011-01-15T07:47:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	under fdisk, according to your pastebin, it looks like you have a volume label of hidden ntfs instead of label 7 which is NTFS not sure if that will fix ur issue but it would be where i start i think read about it i dont want to corrupt your data =P
2011-01-15T07:48:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	I created the partition using 7 for the type (HPFS/NTFS), was that correct?
2011-01-15T07:48:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	The array's blank, so don't worry about messing with it
2011-01-15T07:48:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	in pastebin, it says 'hidden ntfs'
2011-01-15T07:49:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	maybe yer right hold on let me check mine
2011-01-15T07:49:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	I don't see "Hidden NTFS" anywhere :\
2011-01-15T07:52:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	why is the device so weird, im used to seeing /dev/sda2 etc
2011-01-15T07:52:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	lvm also?
2011-01-15T07:52:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	I don't know
2011-01-15T07:53:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	My old motherboard had an nVidia controller and it worked fine out of the box, but this new one has an Intel controller and it doesn't seem to want to work with Ubuntu
2011-01-15T07:53:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	try this command 'lsvg'
2011-01-15T07:54:00.000Z	Alex__K	sta7ic	Command not found, did you mean lshg or rsvg?
2011-01-15T07:55:00.000Z	sta7ic	Alex__K	it changes so much for me, used to be lsvg oh well i dont know sorry sounds like a volume group more than RAID
