2012-05-20T12:56:00.000Z	fasta		I run that Ubuntu screen program, but inside such a session I started another screen session. When I press C-a C-d, it detaches from the outer Ubuntu screen session. How do I detach from the inner screen session?
2012-05-20T12:57:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	I will kill the second session with ctrl+d
2012-05-20T12:58:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	that has no effect.
2012-05-20T12:58:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	if you are in the second session? you should be able to ctrl+d and exit
2012-05-20T12:58:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	I also cannot press F9 to get the menu.
2012-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	my second session is this irc chat.
2012-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	there is no extra shell
2012-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	that doesn't sound like a very informed solution.
2012-05-20T13:00:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	if you kill the first session, I think it will kill the second session
2012-05-20T13:00:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	Im just saying what is easy
2012-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	I already found the answer.
2012-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	screen -r?
2012-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	great? i use screen everyday, i hate it when that happens [:
2012-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	no, and you should t advice people to kill programs.
2012-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	solution was c-a-a-d.
2012-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	ah I didnt know you were running the program...
2012-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	yes, you knew.
2012-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	because I said it was my irc client.
2012-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	ctrl+d is the easy thing to do, if you do not like the advice, feel free to ask someone else.
2012-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	I also told you that ctrl+d didnt work.
2012-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	and where was I?
2012-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	fasta	jellyblob	you should really stop your redundant talking.
2012-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	I didnt know you were in your irc client.
2012-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	jellyblob	fasta	you got your answer /ignore fasta
