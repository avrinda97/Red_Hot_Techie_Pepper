2007-04-08T05:02:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	openvpn as for a gui you need to get the tools from kde for it
2007-04-08T05:03:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		yeah
2007-04-08T05:03:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	the full instructions are in the faq on the openvpn site and it is easy if you follow it "slowly" and don't block connections it wants on the firewall
2007-04-08T05:04:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		hmmm. ok, i guess theres no quick fix like in windows then
2007-04-08T05:04:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		jburd; what is it?
2007-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	I told ya where to get the gui
2007-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		is it called kvpnc?
2007-04-08T05:06:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon	ompaul	ive tried kvpnc, doesnt do it
2007-04-08T05:06:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	well openvpn faq if followed should get you using it inside 30 mins once it is all installed on both ends
2007-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	ompaul		there is a "quick and dirty" setup
2007-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		oh ok, so its gotta be goin on both ends?
2007-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		like, work have a vpn setup already, im just tryin to get to it
2007-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	no the software must have a server side and a client side but the program must run on both ends to allow for creating a tunnel between the two machines
2007-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		oh ok
2007-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		right, so ill have to ask work what theyve got at work
2007-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul		most likely a cisco - you can do a vpn over ssh also
2007-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	NotKevinBacon		sorry for my ignorance, ive been put onto ubuntu just recently, so im just learning, thanks for your pacience guys
2007-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	^^ see my cisco comment
2007-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	ompaul	NotKevinBacon	it is rewarding if you put in the time
