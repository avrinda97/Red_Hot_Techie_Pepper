2008-02-05T05:35:00.000Z	dm_edge		I'm sorry of being persistent, but can anyone help me solve my dhcp problem? I've been trying all kinds of stuff but nothing seems to work out... I'm also a total noob when it comes to linux:)
2008-02-05T05:37:00.000Z	dm_edge		after installing nvidia drivers kdm got stuck, so I returened it to the "nv" driver, but after logging in again to kdm there's no connection to the internet anymore
2008-02-05T05:38:00.000Z	dm_edge		it's set to dhcp but it doesn't receive an address anymore, but it used to work just fine
2008-02-05T05:39:00.000Z	dm_edge		yeah, I copied what I saw on my other pc which has windows but no luck
2008-02-05T05:39:00.000Z	dm_edge		I tried to set the same gateway address
2008-02-05T05:40:00.000Z	dm_edge		but anyways dhclient broadcasts to all addresses right? so it supposed to find the modem
2008-02-05T05:40:00.000Z	dm_edge		it's not wireless it's wired
2008-02-05T05:40:00.000Z	dm_edge		admtek card
2008-02-05T05:41:00.000Z	dm_edge		I could, but it's all in Japanese, is it still fine by you?:)
2008-02-05T05:41:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	which os are you running? version?
2008-02-05T05:42:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	on a  terminal   sudo dhclient eth0
2008-02-05T05:43:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	 ifconfig -a   and pastebin your result please
2008-02-05T05:49:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	I did ifconfig -a, where should I paste the results?
2008-02-05T05:55:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	can you kindly paste your /etc/network/interfaces  ?  the one you just pasted shows no ip address assigned to eth1
2008-02-05T05:56:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	sure, but are there any other commands you'd like to see? since it takes to to move the data, I'd rather copy as much as I can at once
2008-02-05T05:57:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	the file /etc/network/interfaces should be that many lines, maybe you can post them here, separate each line with ";"
2008-02-05T05:57:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	the file /etc/network/interfaces should not* be that many lines, maybe you can post them here, separate each line with ";"
2008-02-05T06:01:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	pasted in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/54794/
2008-02-05T06:03:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	2 lines are wrong, dont put those ip address in line 3 and line 4
2008-02-05T06:04:00.000Z	amenado	dm_edge	yes, remove those two lines
2008-02-05T06:06:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	oh sorry about that:)
2008-02-05T06:10:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	deleted those 2 lines but still no effect
2008-02-05T06:17:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	is there anything else I could try out?
2008-02-05T06:22:00.000Z	dm_edge	amenado	are you still there?
