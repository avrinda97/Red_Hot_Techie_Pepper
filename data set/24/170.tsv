2012-05-15T02:00:00.000Z	chsados		i guess i didnt give it more than 3 or so minutes to do anything
2012-05-15T02:00:00.000Z	chsados		do i let it sit longer?
2012-05-15T02:01:00.000Z	chsados		i did not
2012-05-15T02:01:00.000Z	chsados		i have an ati 4850
2012-05-15T02:01:00.000Z	chsados		4890*
2012-05-15T02:03:00.000Z	chsados		sheldon420 shamelessly i dont know how to do that im heading to the site to find out how
2012-05-15T02:04:00.000Z	chsados		can i use the windows installer to install onto a thumb drive?
2012-05-15T02:04:00.000Z	chsados		im in windows currently i do that in command window?
2012-05-15T02:06:00.000Z	chsados		so you recommend installing ubuntu on an actuall HDD?  I have an empty 500gb internal HD i could put it on instead i guess
2012-05-15T02:08:00.000Z	chsados		ok sorry for the loaded questions...but can i use the windows installer to install it to my 500gb internal HDD or is the windows installer more like a virtual installation within windows?
2012-05-15T02:08:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	an hdd would be recommended
2012-05-15T02:09:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	I recommend linux live usb creator too.
2012-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	it is for windows
2012-05-15T02:11:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	can also create a persistant file, so the live ubuntu can save your preferences, if you want ubuntu on usb sometimes too
2012-05-15T02:13:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	I guess the easiest would be an usb stick with integrated encryption, maybe
2012-05-15T02:15:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	no idea, maybe the installer would let you put encrypted /home onto the stick?
2012-05-15T02:15:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	if not, maybe these would work, no idea how ubuntu would see them http://www.kingston.com/us/usb/encrypted_security
2012-05-15T02:16:00.000Z	chsados	krababbel	 i was thinking just using trucrypt
2012-05-15T02:17:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	don't know if ubuntu supports it, those sticks may be easier, depends on your situation :)
2012-05-15T02:17:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	ubuntu setup shows an encrypted home option I think, never used it
2012-05-15T02:20:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	i think ext would be recimmended
2012-05-15T02:20:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	the live usb, fat32
2012-05-15T02:21:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	yes, boot the usb and install to hdd later
2012-05-15T02:28:00.000Z	krababbel	chsados	if you don't want to bother with special kernels and options, use 64bit with more than 3GB RAM
