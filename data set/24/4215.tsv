2007-08-15T16:25:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	I'm using XChat right now, but it's missing so many things.
2007-08-15T16:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	like what?
2007-08-15T16:26:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	cant nick+tab in query, cant ctrl+tab / ctrl+w to move from a tab to the other, cnat ctrl+q to go from query to query
2007-08-15T05:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	the windows/apple button
2007-08-18T15:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	you need to use gutsy
2007-08-18T15:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	you have to use gutsy
2007-08-18T15:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	that's right, but it's your only option if you want to use kernel 2.6.22
2007-08-18T15:44:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	no
2007-08-18T15:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	well you can, but it will be an unsupported configuration
2007-08-18T15:45:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	will my nvidia card work on it?
2007-08-18T15:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	i guess, you'll need drivers compiled against the new kernel though
2007-08-18T15:46:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	can I have gutsy and my old ubuntu? like gutsy built on the new kernel and 7.04 built on my .16?
2007-08-18T15:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	sure, you can dual-boot feisty and gutsy
2007-08-18T15:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	what is wubi?
2007-08-18T15:49:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	usually takes an 'alternate' form of the iso.
2007-08-18T10:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	are you running it as root?
2007-08-18T10:35:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	no.. mmm.
2007-08-18T10:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	you must run it as root in order to capture anything
2007-08-18T10:35:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	thx :)
2007-08-18T10:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	Lappy	although it is well known for having a lot of security issues, best to capture with tcpdump or kismet then analyze with wireshark as a user
2007-08-18T10:38:00.000Z	Lappy	dystopianray	alright.
