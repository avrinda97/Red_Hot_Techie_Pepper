2011-08-09T09:03:00.000Z	GreenCloud	meoblast001	maybe your Synaptics acquires the lock
2011-08-09T09:03:00.000Z	meoblast001		my SSH session died misway through APT running
2011-08-09T09:03:00.000Z	meoblast001		a lock was acquired that was never and will never be returned
2011-08-09T09:04:00.000Z	meoblast001		yes
2011-08-09T09:05:00.000Z	meoblast001		well, less so broke. in confusion i accidentally closed the terminal
2011-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	meoblast001		root      2523  0.0  4.3  26876 21816 ?        S    00:50   0:00 apt-get install php5-mysql mysql-server mysql-client
2011-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	meoblast001		ah, it's still hung on that install
2011-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	GreenCloud	meoblast001	this kind of problem almost always got fixed by itself...you can try reboot
2011-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		ok, rebooting
2011-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		but now i don't realize why i'm uninstalling mysql in the first place
2011-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		i was uninstalling it so i could tell wols the information on what he was asking
2011-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	meoblast001		but now there's really no point
2011-08-09T09:08:00.000Z	meoblast001		what was my plan b.... it was either dist-upgrade (which never works), install from source, or switch distros
2011-08-09T09:08:00.000Z	meoblast001		eep.. none of which i want to do
2011-08-09T09:09:00.000Z	GreenCloud	meoblast001	you could also try apt-get --fix-missing, then update, before upgrade or dist-upgrade...
2011-08-09T09:10:00.000Z	meoblast001		well, my problem is that MySql is not working
2011-08-09T09:10:00.000Z	meoblast001		just got the machine rebooted
2011-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	meoblast001		ok, working now
2011-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	GreenCloud	meoblast001	glad to hear its working now ;)
2011-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	meoblast001		thanks
2011-08-09T09:11:00.000Z	meoblast001		hm, now dpkg -l |grep mysql returns nothing
2011-08-09T09:13:00.000Z	meoblast001		here it prints out a bunch of package info
2011-08-09T09:15:00.000Z	GreenCloud	meoblast001	try sudo apt-get install mysql-server and see if fix the problem...
2011-08-09T09:15:00.000Z	meoblast001	GreenCloud	nope
