2008-08-11T21:53:00.000Z	jimmygoon		how can I get nautilus to open folders in thunar on the desktop?
2008-08-11T21:54:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	nautilus and thunar are both filemanagers you arent making any sense.
2008-08-11T21:56:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	gnome uses nautilus as the desktop drawer
2008-08-11T21:57:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	so nautilus draws the desktop, so when I double click folders they open in nautilus rather than thunar
2008-08-11T21:57:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	yes filemanager you mean, you want it to use thunar instead?
2008-08-11T21:58:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/nonautilusplease its took my 5 seconds on google to find this please do your research before asking questions here
2008-08-11T21:59:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	you are exceptionally rude, I already used that script
2008-08-11T21:59:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	and it doesn't replace nautilus to draw the background/desktop
2008-08-11T22:00:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	thunar doesnt do backgrounds.
2008-08-11T22:01:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	im not sure what you want here
2008-08-11T22:01:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	I want nautilus to open folders in thunar. Since nautilus is running to control my desktop, it keeps launching folders to itself. I want to tell it to open with thunar
2008-08-11T22:02:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	I get it, so you dont want to replace nautilus
2008-08-11T22:02:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	well, not completely I suppose - I tried xfdesktop4 but it was... not to my liking
2008-08-11T22:03:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	why dont you set your background with some other app and just remove nautilus in favor of thunar
2008-08-11T22:05:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	that would be okay. I just don't know of another/better background manager, like I said I tried xfdesktop4, but that was not good
2008-08-11T22:05:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	feh
2008-08-11T22:06:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	feh can be used to set background images.
2008-08-11T22:06:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	its in the repos
2008-08-11T22:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	I'm reading the --help right now, thanks
2008-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	thanks for the feh suggestion
2008-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	no problem
2008-08-11T22:12:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	are there any errors when you run the script?
2008-08-11T22:12:00.000Z	jimmygoon	nixnoob	none, and there are forum topics on this as well, with the same scripts mentioned, and the same lack of change in regards to nautilus/desktop
2008-08-11T22:13:00.000Z	nixnoob	jimmygoon	well enjoy feh for the time being im out to lunch
