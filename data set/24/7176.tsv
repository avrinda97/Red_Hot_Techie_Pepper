2005-04-16T13:23:00.000Z	neighborlee		Is there a log file I could check to find out why my desktop came crashing down after a evolution crash ??
2005-04-16T13:23:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	what do you meen by 'desktop'
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	well..the desktop became totally unresponsive after a few moments..
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	evo crashed then gnome-panel stopped responding then finally right click desktop stopped working
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	ah
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	although oddly enough xchat never budged LOL
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	try running top on one of the consoles
2005-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	alt+ctrl+f1, login, top
2005-04-16T13:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	i've hard rebooted long since ;-)
2005-04-16T13:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	but yeah worth a shot next time if it happens ag ain
2005-04-16T13:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	with any luck there is a fix in the works ( I filed a bug report )
2005-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	I hardly never reboot - kernel doesn't crash with desktop
2005-04-16T13:26:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	try alt+ctrl+backspace in hard cases
2005-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	I even tried that ye4s
2005-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	but while it worked it logged me out of x entirely without trying to restart it..so whatever happened was prettty bad LOL
2005-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	I then tried : sudo reboot < but even that 'hung' on trying to stop  cupsd
2005-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	so in end a hard shutdown was needed ;(
2005-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	hmm strange
2005-04-16T13:29:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	could you try to remote login next time
2005-04-16T13:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	I guess I should have tried Ctrl-alt-f! but who knows if even that would have worked due to the crash
2005-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	only have one other machine and thats windowsXP
2005-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	zyga	neighborlee	that's okay - run putty, the only useful windows program :)
2005-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	interesting....illl look it up thx <<
2005-04-16T13:31:00.000Z	neighborlee	zyga	LOL only useful windows app..how true indeed LOL
