2009-03-03T20:17:00.000Z	KDB9000		Is there a way to set up ubuntu to check my e-mail in Evolution without having to have Evolution up?
2009-03-03T20:19:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	are you just wanting it to display a notification if there is mail or do you want it to actually download it and store it without starting up?
2009-03-03T20:20:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	notification, without evolution being up
2009-03-03T20:21:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	right on.  I'm not sure Evolution is going to need to be used at all.  I can only imagine there would be other apps that can simply check for email and display a notification.
2009-03-03T20:22:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	there is, but it says you need to have Evolution up
2009-03-03T20:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I found an answer for you I think.  sudo apt-get install mail-notification
2009-03-03T20:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	if you just want to see the app, http://nongnu.org/mailnotify
2009-03-03T20:24:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	that is the one that says you need evolution up to check it.
2009-03-03T20:24:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I think it runs either independently or with Evolution
2009-03-03T20:26:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I think the mail-notification is the app that suits what you're looking for most
2009-03-03T20:26:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	I was hoping there was an app that could be used without having evolution be up.
2009-03-03T20:27:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I don't think Evolution needs to be up with this one.  There's nothing on the site that indicates this.
2009-03-03T20:29:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	that link you sent, didn't work
2009-03-03T20:29:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	sorry, I suck at typing sometimes:  Homepage: http://www.nongnu.org/mailnotify/
2009-03-03T20:31:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	do you know how to make Evolution start at login and open in a different desktop?
2009-03-03T20:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I apologize but I do not.
2009-03-03T20:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I'm trying out that mail program myself.  stand by.
2009-03-03T20:36:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	I just tried mail-notification and it works pretty well.  It does NOT require evolution, but it does support functionality with it.
2009-03-03T20:37:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	I plan on trying it out. I thought I already added it but I guess not.
2009-03-03T20:37:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	it's under the Internet section of your Applications menu
2009-03-03T20:40:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	well that isn't good. mail-noifty makes evolution crash
2009-03-03T20:40:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	mail-notify or mail-notification?
2009-03-03T20:41:00.000Z	KDB9000	Huufarted	mail-notification
2009-03-03T20:41:00.000Z	Huufarted	KDB9000	sorry.  :(  I have no suggestions for you.
