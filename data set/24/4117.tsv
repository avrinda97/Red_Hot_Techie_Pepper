2007-07-07T14:25:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	after posting, it will tell you to hit esc to enter the menu
2007-07-07T14:22:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	you need the 100 series drivers, nvidia-new is still the 97 series drivers
2007-07-07T14:23:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	Thank you! But even if I download it directly from NVIDIA HOW do I start Ubuntu without X???
2007-07-07T14:24:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	use the recovery kernel option in GRUB
2007-07-07T14:25:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	Errr hmmm. I have no options screen during bootloader time - it just ejects me directly into login screen
2007-07-07T14:26:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	does your screen go black and lock up when you try to boot, or does it just kick you back into a console?
2007-07-07T14:27:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	I'm on CoreDuo - fast beast - cant see much. ASUS MB logo and BAM Ubuntu logo with orange bar below
2007-07-07T14:28:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	I think that's a timer in your grub config file, but I guess you can't get to that right now ;)
2007-07-07T14:28:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	are you in a console, though, after your nv drivers fail you?
2007-07-07T14:28:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	everything works. But need X free mode to play with NVIDIA binary driver. BTW do I have Ububtu kernel source or stripped source installed by default or I have to find it?
2007-07-07T14:29:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	I think you have to pull them from apt/synaptic
2007-07-07T14:29:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	pull what? Latest drivers?
2007-07-07T14:30:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	not drivers, the kernel sources
2007-07-07T14:30:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	the latest drivers aren't in official ubuntu repositories
2007-07-07T14:31:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	what name should I look for? I'm old Mandriva rider so packages names were starting with kernel------- but here after search kernel I get nothing!?
2007-07-07T14:32:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	have you seen this? http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=72490
2007-07-07T14:33:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	that will tell you roughly how to install the 100 series nvidia drivers manually
2007-07-07T14:34:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	Also, you can try using Envy: http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html, although Envy didn't work for me
2007-07-07T14:34:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	thank you very much!
2007-07-07T14:35:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	no problem
2007-07-07T14:37:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	very good reading even if it will fail on me too - I go for it!
2007-07-07T14:55:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	What is qeuivalent in Ubuntu of Mandrivas "telinit 3" ???
2007-07-07T14:56:00.000Z	Bill_S	AnObfuscator	under su I did init 3 and nothing happened
2007-07-07T15:01:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	Bill_S	I can't recall, off the top of my head
