2010-05-10T05:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	where's this script? i want to run it! :P
2010-05-10T06:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	seriously, you cold maybe look at the script and try to see what it did. then you could try to undo it
2010-05-11T10:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	hello. took me a bit to find where that 'might' be. still looking here --> ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal
2010-05-11T10:54:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	Thanks bud.
2010-05-11T10:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	you're welcome. find what you were looking for? perhaps if you backup the 'profiles' directory in there...
2010-05-11T10:56:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	Yep. It has XML config files with colours in them. Good stuff.
2010-05-11T10:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	cool. roger :-)
2010-05-11T11:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	perhaps 'Ghost for Unix, g4u. haven't ever used it. but that's what it's made for
2010-05-11T11:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/
2010-05-19T07:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	what Ubantu_dude said... find the .deb file for it and download it. then use 'dpkg' command to install the .deb file you downloaded
2010-05-19T07:50:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	where would I find the deb?
2010-05-19T07:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	i don't think this matters too much, but what version of ubuntu are you running?
2010-05-19T07:50:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	10.04
2010-05-19T07:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	roger.. hang on a moment
2010-05-19T07:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/zsnes
2010-05-19T07:53:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	There is no x64 architecture. Is this my issue?
2010-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	there's the link for it, but i think maybe you have /etc/apt/sources.list problem. you should be able to just install it with apt-get/aptitude/synaptic command really
2010-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	could be.. hang on a moment again
2010-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	See my last reply. It may be because it only supports x86
2010-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	yep... that's a problem
2010-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	I really really like ZSNES for emulators. Is Wine my only option now?
2010-05-19T07:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	i even have the 32-bit libs installed and it won't install in my 64-bit Lucid... no installation candidate found. which means, it's not in the 64-bit repos
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	Jon--	onetinsoldier	Ubantu_dude: "tools/fileutil.cpp:1: error: CPU you selected does not support x86-64 instruction set"  Damnit.
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Jon--	:-(
