2011-02-22T23:28:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	have you looked into ndiswrapper?
2011-02-22T23:29:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	the first link is a guide to use ndiswrapper, so. yes ive tried that
2011-02-22T23:29:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	i might have done it wrong though ;)
2011-02-22T23:31:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	there is a gui for it...gtkndis or some such....search for ndiswrapper in synaptic
2011-02-22T23:33:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	is this a usb wifi?
2011-02-22T23:33:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	no, one of those old bigass cards
2011-02-22T23:36:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	make sure you are using the windows xp drivers and not windows 7....don't think they will work
2011-02-22T23:37:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	how can i se what i got?
2011-02-22T23:37:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	I usually go to the manufacturers website and download the latest drivers from there
2011-02-22T23:43:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	you mind helping me to uninstall the vista driver i used first and replace it with the xp driver?
2011-02-22T23:43:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	seems that is the problem
2011-02-22T23:43:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	is it working now?
2011-02-22T23:44:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	no. and when i try to install the xp driver it says the driver already is installed, wich is true, so i need to uninstall de vistadriver first
2011-02-22T23:44:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	and for that i need help :)
2011-02-22T23:45:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	the gtk thing should allow you to uninstall
2011-02-22T23:48:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	'ndiswrapper -l' will list the installed drivers, and 'ndiswrapper -d <name>' will remove the installed drivers
2011-02-22T23:49:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	 reidar@reidar-Presario-R3200-PA473EA-ABN:~/Nedlastinger/WL-140v2$ ndiswrapper -lwl54cfg : driver installed
2011-02-22T23:49:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	 but no wifi :(
2011-02-22T23:50:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	does the wifi show up in either ifconfig or iwconfig?
2011-02-22T23:50:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	those are files i should have?
2011-02-22T23:51:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	no...commands. Open a terminal and type each one (one at a time) and look through the resulting information to see if the wifi card is even mentioned
2011-02-22T23:52:00.000Z	reidar	th0r	no mention ---> http://pastebin.com/N9K35CeD
2011-02-22T23:55:00.000Z	th0r	reidar	I would check lshw and see if the card is even recognized. But I am not a wizard at desktop hw....maybe someone else can help.
