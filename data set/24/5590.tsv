2006-06-15T16:27:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	irssi
2006-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	what do you need to know
2006-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	i think i have it setup but it isnt working
2006-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	i have */10 * * * * /home/bassetts/logs/IBO/ftp.sh in my crontab file, but it is not running the script every ten minutes
2006-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	did you use crontab -e? if not did u set the crontab file correctly?
2006-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	i did crontab -l and it showed up
2006-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	ok 1 sec
2006-06-19T06:11:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	for the script
2006-06-19T06:13:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	i'm not too familiar with crontab - so i usually use gcrontab, which is a nice little gui for crontab
2006-06-19T06:13:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	i cant use gui as i am setting it up on a shell over ssh
2006-06-19T06:13:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	ok nevermind then. your crontab line looks ok
2006-06-19T06:14:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	might also wanna make sure you're running the right crontab
2006-06-19T06:14:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	how do i check that?
2006-06-19T06:15:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	well, if you wanna just rule out any other possibilities, you can first try doing chmod 777 ftp.sh
2006-06-19T06:15:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	if it works, then you probably are trying to run the script by the wrong user
2006-06-19T06:16:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	how can i check the permissions of a file in terminal?
2006-06-19T06:16:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	ls -ll
2006-06-19T06:18:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	doesnt appear to be working still
2006-06-19T06:18:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	the .sh works because i can run it myself and it does what it should
2006-06-19T06:19:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	ok. it is probably an issue with the crontab then
2006-06-19T06:19:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	could it be i dont have the privledges on the shell?
2006-06-19T06:20:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	Bassetts	i think by default you should have permissions to do crontab
2006-06-19T06:20:00.000Z	Bassetts	pppoe_dude	ok
