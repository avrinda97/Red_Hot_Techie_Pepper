2006-03-26T10:36:00.000Z	BlueOrange		ok, i want to be able to play DVD video as well as xvid and divx video. i have read the info at: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and i thought i did all the stuff, but it still doesn't work.
2006-03-26T10:37:00.000Z	BlueOrange		scream: im not sure, tried to do all the stuff listed there, which included some codec32 stuff which seemed important :) Can u tell me how to install ur said pkg or to check if i have it.
2006-03-26T10:39:00.000Z	BlueOrange		i believe i have already enabled the universe and multiverse repositories, but again, im not REALLY sure of anything here!
2006-03-26T10:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	Could you post your sources.list on paste.ubuntulinux.nl?
2006-03-26T10:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	Its an internet site
2006-03-26T10:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	In terminal, run "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list", then copy the contents into the textbox on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-03-26T10:47:00.000Z	BlueOrange	Stormx2	looks like ur helping alot of people! i have posted the info and will wait for your instructions.
2006-03-26T10:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	That looks fine to me. Run "sudo apt-get update", then have a look in synaptic, how many packages does it say there are at the bottom?
2006-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	BlueOrange	Stormx2	synaptic reports i have 1100 installed.
2006-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	How many available?

2006-03-26T10:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	Good, that means you have universe and multiverse working. btw, surely its 17786?
2006-03-26T10:54:00.000Z	BlueOrange	Stormx2	oops, yes, coorrection=17789 pkgs listed.
2006-03-26T10:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	BlueOrange	Well, you have them installed, what now/
2006-03-26T10:59:00.000Z	BlueOrange	Stormx2	et al, i still dont seem to be able to view a dvd or divx content.
