2008-06-08T04:48:00.000Z	Ours		cd home/user/this directory
2008-06-08T04:49:00.000Z	Ours		I stick with VmWare
2008-06-08T04:51:00.000Z	Ours		http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/5903/screenshotcy3.png there you go
2008-06-08T04:52:00.000Z	Ours		I'm assuming that the NTFS should be at 68, as should extended?
2008-06-08T04:52:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	what are you trying to do?
2008-06-08T04:53:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	I was trying to install Ubuntu as a secondary OS on a second partition, but I accidentally created a two partitions instead of just one
2008-06-08T04:53:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	your partitions are setup correctly
2008-06-08T04:53:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	the sda3 is just the opening to your logical partitions
2008-06-08T04:54:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	have you installed ubuntu yet?
2008-06-08T04:54:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	 I have
2008-06-08T04:55:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	you may have to reinstall,  because if you want it to only be 60GB and open more room for the first partition (vista) you'll have to delete sda3-5
2008-06-08T04:56:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	yes
2008-06-08T05:10:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	whats up?
2008-06-08T05:10:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	would it be better to have the two partitions (Vista and Ubuntu) share data, or to have the separate
2008-06-08T05:11:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	vista and ubuntu can share a data partition, if its ntfs
2008-06-08T05:11:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	boot from live disk
2008-06-08T05:12:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	 I am using the Live CD, which is why I'm lost
2008-06-08T05:13:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	can you right click on the partition in question and go to information and see what it says
2008-06-08T05:16:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	 if I were to shrink down ext3 from 100 gigs down to 5, would I run into any problems in the long run?
2008-06-08T05:16:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	you should be able to run your / ubuntu on 5GB, as long as you don't install alot of stuff,  maybe with the space you have 10 would be better
2008-06-08T05:26:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	 I still can't get the locks off by the sda3, I've tried restarting and I've tried right-clicking and going to properties.  It doesn't tell me how to delete that partition :/
2008-06-08T05:29:00.000Z	musikgoat	Ours	 on the live disk, are you running gparted under sudo?
2008-06-08T05:30:00.000Z	Ours	musikgoat	just sudo
