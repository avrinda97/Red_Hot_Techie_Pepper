2010-12-27T23:26:00.000Z	Didji		I want to synchronize a folder on my windows machine with a the htdocs folder of apache on my ubuntu machine.  What's the best way to go about this?
2010-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	Didji		It has to update the apache folder everytime I save anything.
2010-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	try dokan sshfs to mount your apache folder on your windows machine
2010-12-27T23:28:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	that means the actual files would reside on the apache machine's hdd?
2010-12-27T23:28:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	yes
2010-12-27T23:28:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	yeah, that's a problem.  I need the files to live on my windows machine.
2010-12-27T23:29:00.000Z	Didji		Is there no way to do it the other way round?
2010-12-27T23:29:00.000Z	Didji		Somehow synch with ftp?
2010-12-27T23:29:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	hit google for dirsync win32
2010-12-27T23:29:00.000Z	Didji		k, thanks.
2010-12-27T23:30:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	you sure this application is kosher?  The English is pretty borken.
2010-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	well it seems to be made by some germans, that would explain the english, I used it quite some time, but I can not guarantee for anything of course
2010-12-27T23:32:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	k, fair enough.
2010-12-27T23:44:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	this program stops working after the trial period?
2010-12-27T23:45:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	not sure as I switched to dokan quite soon
2010-12-27T23:46:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	is Dokan going to be a viable option for me (I don't know what it does).
2010-12-27T23:46:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	just to make sure http://www.dirsyncpro.org/ this is what we are talking about?
2010-12-27T23:47:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	Oh, I was talking about this: http://www.archersoft.com/
2010-12-27T23:48:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	well probably not as the files will reside on the apache machine. you could still use dokan and sync your "local dokan" drive with your dev folder(s)
2010-12-27T23:49:00.000Z	Didji		Is there no way to have a shared directory on a windows machine be the mounted on an Ubuntu machine, and then set httpd.conf to use that mounted directory as it's base directory?
2010-12-27T23:50:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	you could mount it from the ubuntu machine: mount -t cifs -o user=foo,pass=bar,domain=qouz,rw,noexec,noatime //windowze/share /mnt/here and set up apache to have its files in /mnt/here
2010-12-27T23:50:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	apache would be cool with that?
2010-12-27T23:52:00.000Z	suspectx	Didji	depends, you must make shure, apache will have access rights to /mnt/here and unix is picky about lower/uppercase while windows is not
2010-12-27T23:52:00.000Z	Didji	suspectx	cool.  Thanks for the help.
