2007-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	jxxxt	jrib	OK I cannot remain in exchat if I do that as soon as I try to open another program I get a lock up if memtest  is ok is there a h/dtest I cando??

2007-10-03T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	jxxxt	I don't know
2007-10-03T07:15:00.000Z	jxxxt	jrib	Do you know if a failing h/d demonstrates similar faults to memory lack???
2007-10-03T07:15:00.000Z	jrib	jxxxt	I don't know
