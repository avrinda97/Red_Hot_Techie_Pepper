2007-04-29T12:34:00.000Z	web_knows		does anyone have idea of what mkfs.ext3 parameters are used when the installation programa formats the partitions?
2007-04-29T12:34:00.000Z	web_knows		it's failuring through the graphical interface, so I want to try it on the console
2007-04-29T12:34:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	try the alternate cd?
2007-04-29T12:35:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	you can specify the mkfs.ext3 options there
2007-04-29T12:35:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	generally "sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1" or whatever will give you a great working fast ext3 partition
2007-04-29T12:35:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	I don't know this "alternate cd"
2007-04-29T12:35:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	cool, thanks
2007-04-29T12:38:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	I discovered what's wrong: the mkfs.ext3 is telling me that the partition I'm trying to format is mounted.
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	ah
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	but in fact it is not. I checked /proc/mounts and mount command. it's not mounted.
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	any ideas on that?
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	weird.
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	uhh what parition?  like /dev/sda2?
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	/dev/hdb3
2007-04-29T12:39:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	is any drive on /dev/hdb mounted?
2007-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	if so unmount all drives on hdb and try "sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb3"
2007-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	there's nothing mounted there. I checked with 'mount' and 'cat /proc/mounts'. no references
2007-04-29T12:40:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	okay, im not sre
2007-04-29T12:41:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	there is a -F force option
2007-04-29T12:41:00.000Z	xtknight	web_knows	you can try -v to get verbose messages too
2007-04-29T12:41:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	yeah, I was reading about '-F' right now.
2007-04-29T12:42:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	but gonna try with -v before that ;)
2007-04-29T12:43:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	btw, -v is not that verbose. made no difference running mkfs.ext3 with that flag :d
2007-04-29T12:45:00.000Z	web_knows	xtknight	weird. I tried this: mke2fs -j -v -F -F /dev/hdb3. same deal "is mounted".
