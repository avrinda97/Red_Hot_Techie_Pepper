2007-12-23T20:19:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	i chosed to reboot
2007-12-23T20:20:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	wait longer, when I first installed ubuntu it booted for 5 minutes with a black screen
2007-12-23T20:20:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	okay :S
2007-12-23T20:33:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	you said the first time it took 5 minutes before your screen would show anything. How did you make sure it did not take that long, the second time?
2007-12-23T20:34:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	I haven't done anything
2007-12-23T20:34:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	okay

2007-12-23T20:40:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	it works after waiting?
2007-12-23T20:41:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	yes. I am trying to get it to boot faster now
2007-12-23T20:42:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	I tried that also, but can't get it to boot faster :(( stopped trying the second day
2007-12-23T20:42:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	so you wait so long each time?
2007-12-23T20:43:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	no, I usually wait for 3 min.
2007-12-23T20:43:00.000Z	Shimfs	white_eagle	okay :(
2007-12-23T20:43:00.000Z	white_eagle	Shimfs	I have an older laptop thats why, but windows booted 3 times slower
