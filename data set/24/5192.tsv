2006-09-27T07:20:00.000Z	sc0tty_		my focus is screwed again :(
2006-09-27T07:20:00.000Z	sc0tty_		my windows focus is set to click; but I need to click on the titlebar for the window to become active
2006-09-27T07:22:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I use reiserfs
2006-09-27T07:23:00.000Z	voraistos	sc0tty_	and why is that so ?
2006-09-27T07:23:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I find ext3 slow to boot after a power failure or something
2006-09-27T07:23:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I have 300GB, so it becomes noticeable
2006-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I kept reiserfs because that's what I used when this box was running debian headless
2006-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	sc0tty_		when I got a screen, I installed ubuntu, but only reinstalled /
2006-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	sc0tty_		which might be ext3 when I come to think of it
2006-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	sc0tty_		yes my / and /opt are ext3 (ubuntu specific stuff I reinstalled)
2006-09-27T07:25:00.000Z	sc0tty_		my /data and /home are reiserfs
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	voraistos	sc0tty_	So would u recommend ReiserFS or Reiser4?
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	sc0tty_		reiserfs is fairly easy to install, the tools are easy to install, and it's (more or less) well supported
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I've never had problems with my reiserfs so far
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	voraistos	sc0tty_	what kind of "tools" do i get ?
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	sc0tty_		mmh mkreiserfs
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	voraistos		lol
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	sc0tty_		yo ucan find them in synaptic iirc
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I find reiserfs to be geekier lol
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	sc0tty_		it sounds better when you talk with people
2006-09-27T07:28:00.000Z	voraistos	sc0tty_	looool i am gonna check on synaptic what i can get
2006-09-27T07:28:00.000Z	sc0tty_		I chose it at first after with the admin at work, he said he found it so much faster for a server
2006-09-27T07:28:00.000Z	sc0tty_		after *talking
2006-09-27T07:33:00.000Z	sc0tty_	voraistos	have fun :)
