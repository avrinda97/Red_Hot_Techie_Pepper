2011-03-19T07:42:00.000Z	aliciapg		could someone help me? my computer shutdown because it overheated and now it only goes to the ubuntu boot screen and stops there
2011-03-19T07:43:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	It's probably still overheating.  Are the fans spinning?
2011-03-19T07:43:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	no i let it cool down
2011-03-19T07:44:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	it usually skips the screen to select what kernal but now it isn't
2011-03-19T07:44:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	does it freeze?
2011-03-19T07:45:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	i select a kernal, it does that boot screen where you just see the ubuntu logo, then goes black with the backlight on
2011-03-19T07:45:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	What about other kernels?
2011-03-19T07:45:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	i've tried two so far...should i try others?
2011-03-19T07:45:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	Recovery mode?
2011-03-19T07:46:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	okay i'll try that too
2011-03-19T07:47:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	well now what :/ it worked but i don't know what to do with the shell
2011-03-19T07:47:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	sudo gdm
2011-03-19T07:48:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	i don't think it's a normal shell...
2011-03-19T07:49:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	it has "(initramfs)" as the prompt
2011-03-19T07:50:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	That's not a full boot.  Did you get any errors?  shift + page up to scroll back and look for some.
2011-03-19T07:51:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	yeah it has quite a few...
2011-03-19T07:51:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	Like what?  What's the first one?  The last one?  The one that seems most important to you?
2011-03-19T07:53:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	if failed to mount things like /sys on /root/sys, /dev on /root/dev, /proc on /root/proc
2011-03-19T07:54:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	That's important errors but not the cause.  That's the effect of something.  Look earlier.  Something is going wrong so that they cannot be mounted.
2011-03-19T07:55:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	JBD: failed to read block at offset some number?
2011-03-19T07:57:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	That's caused my hdd errors.   You can try using a live CD to try to fix the partitions using fdisk or gparted.
2011-03-19T07:58:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	D: will i lose data?
2011-03-19T07:58:00.000Z	edbian	aliciapg	Possibly.  I'm not experienced with this very much.  You should google that error (the JBD one) and learn about it.
2011-03-19T07:59:00.000Z	aliciapg	edbian	alright thanks, i'll try that
