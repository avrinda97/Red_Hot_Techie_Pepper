2010-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE		hi all! i have trouble with my nvidia driver. it doesn't detect the monitor correctly.
2010-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE		can you tell me how nvidia-settings determins available resolutions? or how to for a custom resolution?
2010-10-22T13:47:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE		i'm using the latest binary driver, btw
2010-10-22T13:49:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE		that exactly is the problem
2010-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	the_german: I suppose both of you are aware of KMS (Kernel Mode setting) ?
2010-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	only vaguely
2010-10-22T13:53:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	sometimes it seems to me, the kernel mod e setting governs which video resolution is chosen. I don't understand the system very well and actually I fear it quite a bit. My own ubuntu graphics was messed ub and the standard text console still is
2010-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	i have this problem with only one type of monitor. all others work.
2010-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	You can use an xorg.conf to define your own monitor and a modeline b hand
2010-10-22T13:55:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	but it will be gone as soon as i use nvidia-settings next. which i do every day. because i use my laptop on different screens at home, on different desks at work, etc
2010-10-22T13:57:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	In that case, the easies solution is to keep a backup xorg.conf and copy it back in place if needed
2010-10-22T13:58:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	and restart X. how do i restart X from gdm? kdm has an option for that...
2010-10-22T13:58:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	The problem may be very likely that the monitor doesn't identify itself correctly via dde , which seems to be required by current xorg auto-config-magic :-(
2010-10-22T13:58:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	which is why i'm asking for *manual* config for nvidia-settings. or at least xrandr.
2010-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	re-enable Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to kill the X-Server ... or just 'sudo pkill X#
2010-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	still kills the session...
2010-10-22T14:00:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	nvidia-settings is nvidia's proprioetary approach for mode setting and does not really follow linux customs. The the thing like "System Control -> Display -> Properties -> Screen Resolutuion" is a Window-ism and doesn't really make sense for unix.
2010-10-22T14:01:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	The wrongness ist that they rewrite xorg.conf each time where only an xrandr-command would be needed
2010-10-22T14:01:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	i don't even see anything like "System Control -> Display -> Properties -> Screen Resolutuion" anywhere...
2010-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	Oh, you can set a modeline with xrandr's --newmode command, then activat that
2010-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	Daniel_WMDE	mmoebius	cool - how? xrandr is extremly confusing to me. how do i even tell it which display/screen the mode applies to?
2010-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	The "System Control" thing is a window-ism. In Linux, the screen should be configured in xorg.conf or determined via DDE (my opinion(tm))
2010-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	That is where confusion with xrandr sets in with meee, too; let me see ....
2010-10-22T14:08:00.000Z	mmoebius	Daniel_WMDE	Do you have graphics on the machine in question at all ?
