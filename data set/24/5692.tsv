2007-05-24T07:52:00.000Z	Dexter		Hello, anybody can help with with US Robotics Sportster Flash 56k modem (serial) which stopped working iN Feisty?
2007-05-24T07:52:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	what did you already try?
2007-05-24T07:53:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	I've tried using wvdial instead of gnome-ppp, turning carrier-detection off and playing with gnome-pp options
2007-05-24T07:53:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	have you looked deeper already?
2007-05-24T07:53:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	it actually connects but randomly stops working (no activity, but still connected)
2007-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	are you sure the serial port is working?
2007-05-24T07:54:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	Well yes, it is perfectly working on Windows XP (I'm on XP now) and worked great on Edgy
2007-05-24T07:55:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	it disconnects often just on Feisty
2007-05-24T07:55:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	I meant in linux. Module loaded, does it show up in dmesg, etc.
2007-05-24T07:55:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	yes, but wait i'll double check
2007-05-24T07:58:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	i just get serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
2007-05-24T07:58:00.000Z	perpetual		is backfish a robot?
2007-05-24T07:58:00.000Z	Dexter		in my dmesg file
2007-05-24T07:59:00.000Z	Dexter	perpetual	nothing else regarding modem or serial port
2007-05-24T07:59:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	that looks good
2007-05-24T07:59:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	 is it an external serial modem?
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	Dexter		Perpetual: yes it is. Us Robotics Sportster Flash
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	ok, have you tried using it with minicom?
2007-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dexter		Perpetual: no (I dont' know if I already told you, but modem works, just stops sending/receiving packets VERY often)
2007-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	as a way to debug, of course
2007-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dexter		Perpetual: and doesn't disconnect
2007-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dexter		Perpetual: ah, is there any Guide or wiki ? ... googling for it
2007-05-24T08:02:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	well, you need to find out at what level things go wrong
2007-05-24T08:03:00.000Z	perpetual	Dexter	might be at OSI level 1
