2008-11-19T14:56:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		... .... partition size... unknown. @_@; that's not good.
2008-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		... why is the partition that Ubuntu is on of "unknown" size?
2008-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		... it also seems to be unmounted...
2008-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		how can Ubuntu's partition be unmounted?
2008-11-19T14:58:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		What's fsck?
2008-11-19T14:59:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	man fsck,  as the name may imply,  file system check
2008-11-19T15:00:00.000Z	blip-		btw how come ubuntu liveCD doesn't give an option to copy to ram during boot ?  is it that a distro specific thing ?
2008-11-19T15:02:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		do I need to know anything else before I run the Ubuntu CD and run fsck?
2008-11-19T15:03:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		does it matter that the Ubuntu CD I have is an old version?
2008-11-19T15:04:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	you've backed up right ?
2008-11-19T15:04:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		backed up? no. I have nowhere to backup to. T_T;
2008-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	then be careful before pressing yes or no if fsck prompts you, better yet run it in readonly mode first
2008-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		I hate backing up... I don't really know how... I remember the last time I tried to backup all my files it took weeks...
2008-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		I was burning files to discs.
2008-11-19T15:06:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		wait... do I have to backup if my files are on a different partition from the Ubuntu system?
2008-11-19T15:06:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	if you knew what happened to my machine you'd backup every day.... i've been trying to recover stuff from my /home partition for 3 weeks now.... i've lost several months of work.....  get an external HDD and bacnup every few days... it's a 1 click thing after you set it up
2008-11-19T15:08:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	yes you have to... it may corrupt the partion table.  the fastest backup you can do makes use of rsync and the gui front-end grsync..... it only copies over the new files to your backup device...so first time it will copy everything and take ages.... after that it's a few minutes
2008-11-19T15:08:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	blip-	I've lost HDs before... I don't how to backup. plus I'm in debt this month so I can't afford another HD.
2008-11-19T15:09:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	so the real question is, can you afford to lose everything on your HDD right now ?   Because this may happen in the worst scenario
2008-11-19T15:09:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	i know it's annoying and takes long.. but don't rush... i did and regretted it
2008-11-19T15:09:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	blip-	... so... I can't fix Ubuntu until I buy a new HD? T_T;
2008-11-19T15:10:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		god I hate computers.
2008-11-19T15:10:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		why does it have to be so complicated? why can't it EVER be simple?
2008-11-19T15:10:00.000Z	blip-	Chaotic_Descent	it's your call the safety margin you want,  try running fsck in *read-only* mode... that won't affect or damage anything
