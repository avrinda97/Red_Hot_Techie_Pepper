2012-08-09T01:37:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	those two cannot be related. If it's the live version intalled to USB it would have nothing to do with your previous installation.
2012-08-09T01:38:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	I'm not entirely sure. Are you positive you deleted those partitions?
2012-08-09T01:39:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	if you need to delete the partitions they should be in your Disk Management
2012-08-09T01:41:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	If I were you I would go into BIOS. DISABLE every boot device except your USB drive.
2012-08-09T01:42:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	and then boot from the usb drive. If every other drive is disabled we can eliminate your past install from the equation.
2012-08-09T01:43:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	yes. But make sure they are disabled in bios. Not just lower on the list of boot devices. Does this make sense?
2012-08-09T01:44:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	are you asking how do you disable boot devices?
2012-08-09T01:46:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	You find the option in BIOS?
2012-08-09T01:47:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	something like that. It depends on your PC maker. But yes, look around. You should be able to find a list of "CD-ROM" "HDD" "USB" something like that.
2012-08-09T01:48:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	you have them disabled. All except the usb drive?
2012-08-09T01:49:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	alright.  we know then that the usb drive has a password on it for some reason.
2012-08-09T01:49:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	can you re-make the usb drive?
2012-08-09T01:50:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	depends on your hardware.
2012-08-09T01:50:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	if you are not for sure stick with 32bit. It will work no matter what.
2012-08-09T01:51:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	then you should be fine to select 64bit. 32bit will work on a 64bit processor, just not the other way around.
2012-08-09T01:53:00.000Z	nur	systemd0wn	be right back :)
2012-08-09T01:53:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	cool. let me know how it goes.
2012-08-09T02:01:00.000Z	nur	systemd0wn	i have mad usb
2012-08-09T02:01:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	what?
2012-08-09T02:01:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	ah good.
2012-08-09T02:05:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	sorry that didn't work. I have no idea how this is happening to you if you have all other drives disabled.
2012-08-09T02:09:00.000Z	systemd0wn	nur	so you didn't use the one I sent you a link to?
