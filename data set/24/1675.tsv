2009-10-11T02:10:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	I have flash. The most recent plugin from what I can tell
2009-10-11T02:10:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	you probably want to get linux flash 10
2009-10-11T02:11:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	ahhh....  that could be it!  thanks!
2009-10-11T02:11:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	did you download and install it from directions on a site, or just from the ubuntu repositories with apt-get?
2009-10-11T02:12:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	I downloaded the adobe verision
2009-10-11T02:12:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	disregard, that link will take care of you
2009-10-11T02:13:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	vigo, unfortunately, it says I already have it installed.   =\
2009-10-11T02:14:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	vigo, Like I said, some vids work, others don't... it's the wierdest thing...
2009-10-11T02:14:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	are you using 64bit or 32bit ubuntu?
2009-10-11T02:14:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	32
2009-10-11T02:15:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	so you did sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree ?
2009-10-11T02:16:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	vigo, this is a very fresh install, so not many plug-ins installed at all. I pastebin'd my About Plugins here:   http://pastebin.com/d494ac875
2009-10-11T02:16:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	I did it through adobe's website.
2009-10-11T02:17:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	here's a forum thread with a suggestion: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1193567&highlight=FOT004
2009-10-11T02:17:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	thank you!
2009-10-11T02:21:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	That did it!  Thank you! The tutorial that he gave worked perfect for deleting the plugins and reinstalling.
2009-10-11T02:22:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	yeah, I had to do something like that to get things working on 64bit as well
2009-10-11T02:23:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	awesome, well thanks again... now I just need to work on getting my javascripts to run more smooth.
2009-10-11T02:24:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	try firefox 3.5, aka Shiretoko, supposedly it does javascript better
2009-10-11T02:26:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	I'll give it a try here in a bit... if I can get 3.0 to work, I think I'd prefer that for support purposes
2009-10-22T05:33:00.000Z	thedude42	kilo	df -ah not work?
2009-10-22T05:34:00.000Z	kilo	thedude42	THAT worked... thanks!!
