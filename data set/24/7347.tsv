2005-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	gpg can interoperate with pgp 5
2005-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	oh really? do you use it? you think gpgp is better than tkpgp?
2005-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	it supports OpenPGP keys which pgp 5 also supports. but I don't think it supports 3des keys
2005-02-04T07:06:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	I'm a commandline kinda guy.
2005-02-04T07:07:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	I have little scripts for doing stuff like signing keys and emailing them back to the owner encrypted and stuff.
2005-02-04T07:07:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	haha, that's cool, I wish I was more of a commandline kindof guy... how do you create "little scripts"?
2005-02-04T07:09:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	umm lemme find my signing script.
2005-02-04T07:11:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	ok thanks for looking
2005-02-04T07:13:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	http://pastebin.ca/4653
2005-02-04T07:14:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	there's my signing script.
2005-02-04T07:24:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	my mail is actually delivered locally on the system.
2005-02-04T07:17:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	you can decline to answer this if i'm too far behind you on the learning curve, but um, how do I make a script work?  Save it as a txt file then call it up in terminal window or something?  Where would I store the key if I used this?  thanks for sharing the script btw, I'll save it for when I can use it
2005-02-04T07:18:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	it's probably not terribly useful to you..
2005-02-04T07:19:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	by changing the extension to what?
2005-02-04T07:19:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	by changing permissions. not extensions
2005-02-04T07:20:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	mutt is a text based mail reader but it's far more featurefull than pine
2005-02-04T07:21:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	so you use mutt with a smtp/pop mail server?
2005-02-04T07:22:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	no I read mail on my mail server but you can use it with a pop server if you want.
2005-02-04T07:22:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	I'd rather use something like fetchmail and a local mta tho
2005-02-04T07:22:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	if you'd rather use fetchmail why do you use mutt?
2005-02-04T07:23:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	fetchmail as you might not be able to tell from the obtuse name.. fetches mail. it doesn't let you view it or read it or anything else..
2005-02-04T07:25:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	& dseomn: reading mutt.org and catb.org/~esb/fetchmail to understand more!
2005-02-04T07:28:00.000Z	nevyn	heliolith	mail is one of the most complicated things about system administration in my experience
2005-02-04T07:29:00.000Z	heliolith	nevyn	well, i'm bookmarking mutt & fetchmail for a bit  futher along my linux education.
