2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	sapage		I am trying to mount a ntfs partition but when i try to cd into the mount point i get permission denied
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Wrong permissions. How are you mounting it.
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	i followed the guide form ubuntu
2007-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Link me to this guide of yours, please.
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Oh, you're trying ntfs-3g? Sorry, can't help you with that; never needed to write to my ntfs partitions.
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Then why are you trying to install ntfs-3g?
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Don't. Reading is very easy. Do you know the device name (/dev/sda1 or whatever) of your ntfs partition?
2007-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Put a line like this in your fstab:      /dev/sda1       /win/C          ntfs    ro,users,umask=000           0       0
2007-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	adjust to your mountpoint and folder.
2007-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	ta
2007-01-17T10:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	the umask=000 basically means "everyone can read this folder". if that's too loose for you, adjust this permission. umask is the opposite of the hexcode you'd use in chmod: chmod 777 = umask 000
2007-01-17T10:10:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	when i create the mount point in /media/ do i need to change the permission on that folder?
2007-01-17T10:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	It won't do any good.
2007-01-17T10:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	AFAIK.
2007-01-17T10:17:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	i did as you said but everytime i try to look at the point i mounted it i get a permission error
2007-01-17T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	That's a configuration file. You'd need to mount the partition.
2007-01-17T10:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Keep running "sudo umount <mountpoint>" until it tells you nothing is mounted. Then run "mount <mountpoint>" WITHOUT sudo
2007-01-17T10:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Or just reboot. This will sort itself out on restart.
2007-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	sapage@sap:~$ mount /dev/sdb2 /media/storage/
2007-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	No.
2007-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Keep running "sudo umount /media/storage" until it tells you that nothing is mounted. Then run "mount /dev/sdb2"
2007-01-17T10:22:00.000Z	sapage	arrenlex	 cheers feel like a bit of an idiot after that working now :P
2007-01-17T10:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Thankfully, you don't have to do this again :) Now that it's in your fstab, it will automount on boot with proper permissions.
2007-01-17T10:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	sapage	Which is what you want, right?
