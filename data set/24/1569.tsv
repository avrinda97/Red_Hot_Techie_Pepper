2009-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	SingAlong1		hi all
2009-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	SingAlong1		I installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix on my netbook and installed emacs23 on top of it. However I dont like the GTK version of emacs and like the commandline version which can be started with "emacs32 -nw" instead of just "emacs23".
2009-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	SingAlong1		But I went to the menu editor and changed the command to "emacs23 -nw %F" and the menu shortcut did not work.
2009-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	SingAlong1		how do i do it right?
2009-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	 emacs on a netbook...well  why not?
2009-11-18T17:39:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	ya i installed it but i want to start the command line version instead of the gtk version when i use the menu shortcut to start emacs
2009-11-18T17:40:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	so i went to the menu editor and changed the command of the shortcut from "emacs23 %F" to "emacs23 -nw %F". and it didnt work.
2009-11-18T17:40:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	not really sure I can help sorry....Im trying to imagine what the emacs window looks like on a netbook
2009-11-18T17:40:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	it looks the same :)
2009-11-18T17:41:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	but i love the command line version more than the GTK version.
2009-11-18T17:41:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	havent had emacs installed for  a while
2009-11-18T17:42:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	I actually do have emacs installed well wddya know?
2009-11-18T17:42:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	i cant live without emacs.
2009-11-18T17:43:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	are you emacs bins  links  to one single  file?
2009-11-18T17:43:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	?
2009-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	can you run the emacs command from a terminal ?
2009-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	yes
2009-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	 and what do you use as a command to launch emacs from a terminal
2009-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	ah i fixed it. it worked
2009-11-18T17:45:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	what did yo do?
2009-11-18T17:45:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	i had to select "application in terminal" instead of "application" when editing the shortcut :)
2009-11-18T17:46:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	SingAlong1	 right.....but if you were to run it from a terminal yourself it would be" emacs-no-x11" something like that
2009-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	emacs -nw
2009-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	SingAlong1	ScabbyMadman	or emacs23 -nw
