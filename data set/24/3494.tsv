2009-08-30T17:12:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	should i connect the machines using just a ethernet cord or using a router?
2009-08-30T17:14:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	if i connect using a cord, the machines dont detect each oher
2009-08-30T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	is it a crossover cable? and have you set IP addresses?
2009-08-30T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	doesnt matter, there are 3 standards for how the cables are configured in the ends
2009-08-30T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	yes if you have a router then this is all managed,. ith pc to pc you need a crossover cable as well as assign ip addresses as their is no dhcp server
2009-08-30T17:17:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	but using the network detection tool in vista, i cant find the other pc even when they are connected thru the router
2009-08-30T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	you need to set ip addresses manually if you are connecting pc to pc
2009-08-30T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	interfaces by default use dhcp
2009-08-30T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	routers use shcp to assign IP addresses
2009-08-30T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	if you use a pc to pc connection this is not present so you must use static ip
2009-08-30T17:23:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	i wont use pc-pc connection as i dont know if the cabl e is crssover
2009-08-30T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	it will autoconfigure
2009-08-30T17:26:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	 i have the ip address. but i cant seem to mount the shares
2009-08-30T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	can you ping the name or ip of the system
2009-08-30T17:28:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	 yes can ping the machines from each other
2009-08-30T17:28:00.000Z	tp_	ActionParsnip	 using the ip address assigned by the router
2009-08-30T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	then dns is failing
2009-08-30T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tp_	you can add the name and ip to /etc/hosts and then set the other system to a static ip
