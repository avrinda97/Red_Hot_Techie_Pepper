2007-09-24T14:44:00.000Z	BigDaddy	Symian	- just add the CD to your repositories
2007-09-24T14:44:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	I did do that, but it always tries to download something from the internet.
2007-09-24T14:46:00.000Z	BigDaddy	Symian	you still there?
2007-09-24T14:46:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	um, yes.
2007-09-24T14:48:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	wait, I'm reading back - why would restarting X fix this issue?
2007-09-24T14:50:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	what? No. The issue is that I need to install the rt2x00 package in order to get internet access.
2007-09-24T14:50:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	but obviously, I can't use the internet to do that install.
2007-09-24T14:52:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	I am not Loneshadow.
2007-09-24T14:52:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	you're talking to someone else, maybe?
2007-09-24T14:55:00.000Z	BigDaddy	Symian	- open up Synaptic -> Settings -> Repositories
2007-09-24T14:56:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- like I said earlier, I did check to use the cdrom. That worked fine. But when I go to install the package, it still uses the internet.
2007-09-24T14:57:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- let me give that a shot
2007-09-24T14:58:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	after inserting the disk and adding the disk as a repository and then deleting the internet repositories, I then hit "Reload" and it generates an error: "please use apt-cdrom"
2007-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	i'm using Synaptic.
2007-09-24T15:01:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	though when I use the CLI it does the same thing.
2007-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	BigDaddy	Symian	- what file is this you need?
2007-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- the package for "rt2x00"
2007-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- sorry, to your earlier question, yes, I just need to install one single package.
2007-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- tell me how?
2007-09-24T15:08:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- I dunno, is there? How would I find out?
2007-09-24T15:09:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- ok, is that wrong?
2007-09-24T15:11:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	ok, then, is that as simple as a ./configure && ./make && ./make install?
2007-09-24T15:14:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	- I'll tell you how that goes in a second
2007-09-24T15:16:00.000Z	Symian	BigDaddy	error: "Couldn't find package rt2x00-source"
