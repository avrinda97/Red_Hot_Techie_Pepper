2010-05-01T19:03:00.000Z	fr0nk		I have a dual monitor setup. How can I tell mplayer to create a video window on my primary monitor? It always creates the video window centered on the second monitor :(
2010-05-01T19:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 what video card?
2010-05-01T19:04:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G92 [GeForce 9800 GT] (rev a2)
2010-05-01T19:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 you are using the nvidia drivers and have twinview enabled? You  could use compiz and have it place the program on a specfic location.  here i just drag it to the 2nd monitor and fullscreen it.
2010-05-01T19:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 the program may also take command line options as to where to start up
2010-05-01T19:06:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	I use twinView to extend the desktop to the second monitor
2010-05-01T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 if i drag gmplayer to monitor #2 and close it.. then reopen it. it rembers what monitor it was on
2010-05-01T19:07:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	I always have to drag it to the primary monitor, which is kind of inconveniant. Do you know where I can set absolute window positions for specific windows (e.g. title) in compiz?
2010-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	I don't use the gmplayer packet since I don't want a GUI
2010-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 it rembers here for me.
2010-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 then you need to  look at the mplayer config/options/command line.
2010-05-01T19:09:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	I already took a look at /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf but there's no option for positioning the window. Do you know where in compiz I can configure the positioning of windows?
2010-05-01T19:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 'place windows' tool
2010-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	there's a option called "window placement" in ccsm but obviously I'm configuring it wrong since it's not working. I use window title=MPlayer and position 0:0
2010-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 there seems to be a -geometry option

2010-05-01T19:14:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	doesn't this also affect the absolute window size (that would imply scaling to non-native video resolutions)
2010-05-01T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 i alwyas use fullscreen. so rarely have to mess with placement
2010-05-01T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 mplayer -geometry 1024x768+0+0 -screenw 1024 -screenh 768
2010-06-13T13:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 you mean the themes for EMERALD ?
2010-06-13T13:43:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	damn! yes! emerald... sorry! :(
2010-06-13T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 go ahead and use emreald if you want.. but dont be too suprised if emerald vanishes some day soon
2010-06-13T13:45:00.000Z	fr0nk	Dr_Willis	sad destiny for emerald. Is there any reason you know of? It was far ahead the other decorators, especially the editor
2010-06-13T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fr0nk	 no idea. i rarely used it.
