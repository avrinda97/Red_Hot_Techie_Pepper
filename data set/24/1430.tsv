2010-02-15T22:46:00.000Z	PhoenixSTF		where should i start
2010-02-15T22:46:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	either in the command line or with an FTP client like Filezilla
2010-02-15T22:52:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	you using Filezilla?
2010-02-15T22:53:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	is SSH configured on your Ubuntu comp?
2010-02-15T22:54:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	you most likely don't have remote access enabled yet
2010-02-15T22:54:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	go onto your ubuntu machine yourself and install openssh-server
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	go to your Ubuntu comp.  Open a terminal window.  Type: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	then reboot
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	then reboot the Ubuntu computer
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	then try to remote in
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	using the SFTP method on Filezilla
2010-02-15T22:57:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	you owe me NOTHING (I would take the beer and give it to someone else anyways :P)
2010-02-15T22:57:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	if you don't drink beer, then you take the beer and sell it to someone :P
2010-02-15T22:58:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	anyways, I digress, back to the issue
2010-02-15T22:59:00.000Z	Trek	PhoenixSTF	after you install openssh-server, you should have access, so let us know if it works
