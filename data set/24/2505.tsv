2009-12-08T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Hmm.. fstab dosent swap drives around. :) it can mount them to different locations.. but thats not quite the same
2009-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1349256 < my question about it
2009-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 installg a new drive wont move 'sdc2' to 'sdc3' it COULD move sdc to sdd however.
2009-12-08T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 you might need to edit your  'device.map' file if the new drive got  added 'befor' the old one.  with how tye system sees it
2009-12-08T17:27:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	It's edited to include all my drives now
2009-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 i find it easier to keep linux on its own hard drive.   and perhaps put a ntfs parttion after it if i need storage space. one drive can boot windoiws.. other just boots linux
2009-12-08T17:30:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	You're probably right. This drive is significantly faster than others however, I prefer the OS's on the better drive and the others for storage.
2009-12-08T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 also sdc2 is set to be  bootable..  where did this 'windows is on sdc3' come from?
2009-12-08T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 you could change the bootable flag. to be sdc3
2009-12-08T17:35:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	Well I was going to have 1 extended for linux with /home and /, then Win7, then another for storage (this drive is 1TB). Win7 making 2 partitions is kinda annoying, and I have no idea why it's set to be bootable. It does seem retarded but grub doesn't seem to be built for it
2009-12-08T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 change the bootable flag perhaps. I dont use win7 so no idea why it makes 2 partitions.
2009-12-08T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 personally i would set up win7 on its own hd.. and linux on its own hd.
2009-12-08T17:41:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	Yeah, never thought I'd see ubuntu break windows without an easy fix, I'll probably just reinstall win7 without that extra partition so it doesn't screw up again
2009-12-08T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 im not sure it broke windows.. or if windows dis somthing stupid that ubuntu then tried to fix.
2009-12-08T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 ive no idea what that 100mb partition is - or even why its set to be bootable.
2009-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 from what i read at that URL you gave its a special boot partition. for recovery mode.
2009-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 ie: you boot it and then ITS supposed to show how switch off to the actual insstall.. adding a new hard drive may of confused that feature of windows
2009-12-08T17:45:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	Well that's retarded
2009-12-08T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 lots of things MS does are... well.. odd..
2009-12-08T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 and it appears removeing that partition will break windows from booting.. untill you repair it.
2009-12-08T17:46:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	Yeah, I read that
2009-12-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 i would say keep windows on its own hd.. and linux on its own. :) then i use the bios menus to boot windows directly if grub ever goofs it up.
2009-12-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charred	 how much faster is the new hd/fast hd?
2009-12-08T17:50:00.000Z	charred	Dr_Willis	wd caviar black vs a 5200-someting and a 4 year old samsung
