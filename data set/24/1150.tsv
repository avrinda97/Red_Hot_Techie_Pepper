2010-06-17T05:39:00.000Z	stercor		Is it possible to install 10.04 without losing the contents of the hard drive?
2010-06-17T05:39:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	It will replace applications on your harddrive....  So, what are you looking to do?
2010-06-17T05:40:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	Keeping /home, /etc, and /usr/local
2010-06-17T05:40:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Shouldn't touch /home or /usr/local....
2010-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	/etc may be modified depending on the application...  It will not remove items that are not part of the applicaton...  And will usually prompt about changed files....
2010-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	The partitioning instructions only have 2 partitions. A really big one (the whole disk) and a swap partition.
2010-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Uh.....
2010-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	It seems as though the only option is to reformat the whole big partition.
2010-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Are you installing from the CD?
2010-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	That will blow out the whole hard drive.....
2010-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	That's what I figured...
2010-06-17T05:43:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Just insert the CD from within Ubuntu....
2010-06-17T05:43:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Let ubuntu do the update.....
2010-06-17T05:43:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	Ooo...that sounds just fine!
2010-06-17T05:44:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Ubuntu is *smart* that way....
2010-06-17T05:44:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Or use Synaptic/Update manager and let it do the right thing.....
2010-06-17T05:44:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	what command do I give it?  I'm on a CLI.
2010-06-17T05:45:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Then use "aptitude update" and "aptitude upgrade"
2010-06-17T05:46:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	apt-get is different than aptitude....
2010-06-17T05:46:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Fix the keys for apt.....
2010-06-17T05:47:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	aptitude fails at the same place.  Where do I get the keys?
2010-06-17T05:47:00.000Z	HermanDE_	stercor	Here is a whole website that describes everything needed....  http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
2010-06-17T05:48:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	Sounds fine.  I'll go there.
2010-06-17T05:50:00.000Z	stercor	HermanDE_	Sounds good...
