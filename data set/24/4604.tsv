2007-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	d2dchat		Wait, if your card does 2d acceleration only, can it not use Beryl?
2007-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	correct
2007-06-22T12:51:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	what card do you have?
2007-06-22T12:52:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc ATI Radeon XPRESS 200M 5955 (PCIE)
2007-06-22T12:52:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	you're not getting 3d acceleration with fglrx for some reason
2007-06-22T12:53:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	is that a question or a statement? haha
2007-06-22T12:54:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	a statement, that's why Xgl looks weird
2007-06-22T12:54:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	and it's because my card doesn't have 3d acceleration? :-/
2007-06-22T12:54:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	yes it does
2007-06-22T12:55:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	it does? How did you find out?
2007-06-22T12:55:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	because I have a lot of experience with that chip
2007-06-22T12:55:00.000Z	crdlb		I'm 100% sure it has 3d support
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	you are a god then =D
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	but only using fglrx
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	well i found a tutorial i think might help
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_feisty_beryl_ati_radeon
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	d2dchat		what do u think?
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	they recommend that i use the open source driver
2007-06-22T12:56:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	no that's only for the free driver
2007-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	crdlb		it doesn't provide 3d acceleration on your card
2007-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	crdlb		you have to use the proprietary driver (fglrx)
2007-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	ah i see
2007-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	d2dchat	crdlb	so can you help me diagnose the problem?
2007-06-22T12:57:00.000Z	crdlb	d2dchat	maybe, join #ubuntu-effects
