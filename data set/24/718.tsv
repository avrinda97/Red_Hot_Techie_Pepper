2011-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	fadax		how can  i find out what graphics card is inside my laptop?  i want to know for sure what card it is (not just the name of the card which i have a driver installed for)
2011-03-06T01:45:00.000Z	durt	fadax	'lspci' and 'lshw' in a terminal, there are apps in the repos that can do this graphically but you need to install them.
2011-03-06T01:46:00.000Z	durt		!br
2011-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	fadax	durt	in lspci all i can see related to graphics is:   01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 0e31 (rev a1)
2011-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	fadax		how can i get it to tell me the model? i know it's either a nVidia geForce 460M or  a 485M
2011-03-06T01:49:00.000Z	durt	fadax	experiment with it, lotsa -vvv and maybe sudo, see 'man lspci'
2011-03-06T01:49:00.000Z	durt	fadax	get the pci code and reference the readme at nvidia.com
2011-03-06T01:51:00.000Z	fadax	durt	ok how can i get the pci code?  i tried sudo lspci -v   and it's shown more info, but doesn't help me identify the card. i see this: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device 0e31 (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])  Subsystem: CLEVO/KAPOK Computer Device 5102
2011-03-06T01:52:00.000Z	durt	fadax	try lshw, w/wo sudo and the -vvv should get something, if not see system profiler in the repos.
2011-03-06T01:55:00.000Z	fadax	durt	with -vvv i get this: http://pastebin.com/QVM7eqJp   it's quite a lot of info but don't think there is the pci code..?
2011-03-06T01:58:00.000Z	durt	fadax	I think '5102' is what your interested in.
2011-03-06T01:59:00.000Z	durt	fadax	er, 0e31:5102 could be the pci number/code whatever... I think.
2011-03-06T02:05:00.000Z	fadax	durt	is this what a pci code looks like? 10de:0e31
2011-03-06T02:05:00.000Z	durt	fadax	yes, the readme at nvidia.com form the drivers page has a list of all nvidia devices by code.
2011-03-06T02:06:00.000Z	durt		from, even
2011-03-06T02:11:00.000Z	fadax	durt	i can't find this list of pci codes...
2011-03-06T02:11:00.000Z	fadax		on the nvidia website
2011-03-06T02:12:00.000Z	durt	fadax	it's in the readme that comes with the binary drivers, but you can read it on their site. go to the linux driver section.
2011-03-06T02:14:00.000Z	durt	fadax	http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/260.19.36/README/index.html
2011-03-06T02:16:00.000Z	fadax		thanks durt
2011-03-06T02:16:00.000Z	fadax		i can't find it on that list though
2011-03-06T02:16:00.000Z	fadax		but the 485M isn't on the list so maybe i have that
2011-03-06T02:24:00.000Z	fadax	durt	since my pci id is: 10de:0e31   should i be looking for 10de or 0e31 in the list of graphics cards?
