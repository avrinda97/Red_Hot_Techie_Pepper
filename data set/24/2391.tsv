2011-02-15T16:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	what is it you are compiling?
2011-02-15T16:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	so any c++ program will give you this error?
2011-02-15T16:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	what does whereis c++ show you?
2011-02-15T16:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	I have g++ installed 4:4.4.3-1  on this system on 10.04  so it must be avalable
2011-02-15T16:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	if you don't see g++ then try another repository miror site in synaptic
2011-02-15T16:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	did you try change repository mirror site in synaptic
2011-02-15T16:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu  change the download from box
2011-02-15T16:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	see the box that says main server?  change that to like japan
2011-02-15T16:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	yes in the webpage and in synaptic
2011-02-15T16:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	but it does say  but 4:4.3.3-1ubuntu1 is to be installed   so I guess you do have c++ already installed
2011-02-15T16:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	opps to be installed not is installed sorry
2011-02-15T17:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	just update and see if it installs, but now you have some broken package so what's the fix for that?
2011-02-15T17:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	I guess you could try in synaptic Edit>Fix Broken packages
2011-02-15T17:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	well then close synaptic and try sudo apt-get install -f
2011-02-15T17:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	yup reinstall time
2011-02-15T17:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	yup lost,  no you can't just upgrade as far as I can tell you need to do a fresh install from cd
2011-02-15T17:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	you some how have part new and part old sytem, you can't go backward and you can't move forward with a broken system
2011-02-15T17:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	I"m not sure how it happend maybe a failed upgrade?
2011-02-15T17:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	thangavel	 I'm not sure I like the lts systems 10.04 myself but the new version is 10.10
