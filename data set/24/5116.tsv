2007-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	MasseR		Has anyone of you used badram?
2007-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	yes
2007-01-23T13:07:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	Did you get unknown interrupt or fault at EIP <something>
2007-01-23T13:08:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	not during bootup, but it did kernel panic at random times when it was running
2007-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	if the EIP gets corrupted it's almost certainly because of bad ram
2007-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	I can get it to boot randomly
2007-01-23T13:10:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	And yes I have bad ram that's why I have badram :P
2007-01-23T13:11:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	it's weird because memtest shows i have bad ram, and when i specified the bad bits of ram as a boot parameter to a mandriva kernel, BadRAM picked up on it, but it STILL locked up. i think there was other bad ram that BadRAM didn't know about
2007-01-23T13:12:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	however, when i tried opensuse (which didn't have badram compiled in to the kernel) it has never locked up, even with this bad ram
2007-01-23T13:12:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	When I get it to boot it's working like charm, but it's only _if_ I can get it to boot
2007-01-23T13:12:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	ubuntu hasn't locked up either
2007-01-23T13:12:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	really? so it never locks up if it successfully boots?
2007-01-23T13:13:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	but... it's segfaults of the kernel? :P
2007-01-23T13:14:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	Nope
2007-01-23T13:14:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	hmm. if a process is segfaulting and the kernel doesn't lock up when allocating memory, then it might be buffer overflow problems in the process, though i highly doubt it
2007-01-23T13:15:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	What's strange is that I can't boot even if I take the badram= section out
2007-01-23T13:16:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	i'd think that you'd be LESS likely to boot when you take out the badram parameter, if anything
2007-01-23T13:16:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	I can boot everytime when I don't have badram patch installed. What I'm wondering about is wheter the kernel screwed up while compiling or if I'm doing something wrong
2007-01-23T13:17:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	if the kernel isn't kernel panicing, that's one step
2007-01-23T13:18:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	No kernel panics. Only unknown interrupts
2007-01-23T13:19:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	i assume you've tried other, known good, RAM?
2007-01-23T13:19:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	I was hoping I don't have to.. Have to take off graphics card for that
2007-01-23T13:20:00.000Z	Daverocks	MasseR	hm..
2007-01-23T13:20:00.000Z	MasseR	Daverocks	I'll try compiling it again -.-Grr
