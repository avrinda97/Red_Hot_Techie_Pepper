2010-10-15T19:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	sudo -i will simulate a root login
2010-11-04T19:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	grep the output of 'mount'
2010-11-04T19:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	you mean you want to give another user mount privs, or you want to give ownership to that user?
2010-11-04T19:33:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	ownership
2010-11-04T19:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	what filesystem is mounted there
2010-11-04T19:34:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	its my mobile memory card. and if i do sudo chmod 777 /media/abc it comlains that its read only file system. i want its ownership
2010-11-04T19:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	was it mounted read-write?
2010-11-04T19:35:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	how to grep?
2010-11-04T19:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	'mount | grep abc'
2010-11-04T19:36:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	/dev/sdc on /media/1234-5678 type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,flush)
2010-11-04T19:37:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	how to mount it by default each time read write
2010-11-04T19:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	that's odd
2010-11-04T19:38:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	whats odd?
2010-11-04T19:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	that it's using the uid/gid flags
2010-11-04T19:40:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	can it possible due to virus in my mobile?
2010-11-04T19:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	try mounting it with umask=000
2010-11-04T19:41:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	juk mount: /dev/sdc already mounted or /mnt busy
2010-11-04T19:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	umount and then mount
2010-11-04T19:41:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	but how to make it so by default it mount with write permission?
2010-11-04T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	also make sure that there are no open files on the volume
2010-11-04T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	setting the umask=000 will mean that all the files will be 777
2010-11-04T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	FAT doesn't support ACL's, so Linux sets the permissions via mount options, not through chmod
2010-11-04T19:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	AbhiJit	be aware that 777 means that any user could wipe out any files on the volume
2010-11-04T19:44:00.000Z	AbhiJit	tensorpudding	i wll love it. currently i cant do anything in my mobile cant send sms. cant recieve i wll love if anyone can able to wipe out all files
