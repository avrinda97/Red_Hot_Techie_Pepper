2010-08-31T15:54:00.000Z	[KS]		any obvious reason why cron for root would not work on 10.04?
2010-08-31T15:54:00.000Z	[KS]		it's x64, fresh install
2010-08-31T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	how are you coming to that conclusion?
2010-08-31T15:55:00.000Z	[KS]		* * * * * echo `date +%d%m%Y` > /root/cron.log
2010-08-31T15:56:00.000Z	[KS]		does nothing
2010-08-31T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	you're typing that in a terminal or what...
2010-08-31T15:56:00.000Z	[KS]		no it's cron job
2010-08-31T15:57:00.000Z	[KS]		ok I changed to * * * * * /bin/echo "1234" > /root/cron.log
2010-08-31T15:57:00.000Z	[KS]		 -.-
2010-08-31T15:57:00.000Z	[KS]		nvm :D
2010-08-31T15:58:00.000Z	[KS]		kidding, it's ok now
2010-08-31T15:58:00.000Z	[KS]		how comes it needs full path for echo, never saw that one before
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	[KS]		can I just set it in cron directly?
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	[KS]		PATH = ...
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	[KS]		?
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	yes...
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	and "in cron job" is vague...
2010-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	[KS]	jrib	not sure I follow?
2010-08-31T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	when you say "in cron job", it doesn't tell me what you are doing.  But it doesn't matter, you figured it out
2010-08-31T16:06:00.000Z	[KS]	jrib	now that I've set path echo `date` > /root/cron.log work
2010-08-31T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	k
2010-08-31T16:06:00.000Z	[KS]		but echo `date +%d%m%Y` > /root/cron.log does not
2010-08-31T16:07:00.000Z	[KS]		what am I missing?
2010-08-31T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	[KS]	'%' is special, see man 5 crontab
