2010-05-27T03:01:00.000Z	khunter619		I have ISO file for Win XP pro which I downloaded from MSDN. I want to dual boot Ubuntu + XP. I am currently on Ubuntu. I need an application that will make the Win XP setup into USB boot disk; plus any suggestion in advance so I don't break Grub; Unetbootin doesn't work because XP setup uses NTLDR (NT loader) to boot into XP setup.
2010-05-27T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	not sure if you can do that, but you could burn to CD
2010-05-27T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	I guess Windows fan boys in ##windows will know if you can do a bootable USB though
2010-05-27T03:03:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	I was able to do that Winto Flash - http://wintoflash.com/download/en/ ;
2010-05-27T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	oh ok
2010-05-27T03:04:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	I need to do it again, this time with linux app
2010-05-27T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	uh why with a Linux app?
2010-05-27T03:05:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	I can't boot into my Windows partition
2010-05-27T03:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	ok why can't you boot up Windows partition?
2010-05-27T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	apparantly unetbootin can do your bootable Windows USB
2010-05-27T03:09:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	I had Win 7 partition which came preloaded with my netbook; then I installed Ubuntu (which installed Grub); I made a new partition using Gparted to install XP; however when running the XP setup it started causing problems as in it boots win 7 instead; so I deleted win 7 partition; then no OS was loading; so I used my USB live cd to fix GRUB
2010-05-27T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	thats unetbootin
2010-05-27T03:09:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	I already tried Unetbootin;
2010-05-27T03:10:00.000Z	khunter619	sebsebseb	Unetbootin could Not make Win XP setup bootable
2010-05-27T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	Have you got Windows on another computer?
2010-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	I am asking some guys else where by the way
2010-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	anyway yeah you need to use a Windows CD to fix its boot loader, also
2010-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	I know you can boot more than one Windows install from a Windows boot loader menu.  however well ##windows can help with that
2010-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	then once you got Windows booting like that, you will have to reconfigure Grub anyway
2010-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	its Ubuntu 10.04?
2010-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	you need Windows booting first
2010-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	really
2010-05-27T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	with its bootloader, then sort Grub out
2010-05-27T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	khunter619	or get rid of Windows, and use Ubuntu on the net book :)
