2009-03-22T19:52:00.000Z	kristian2		will k3b run fine with gnome instead of kde?
2009-03-22T19:53:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 Yes
2009-03-22T19:54:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 if you want to use k3b because of errors you're receiving when burning a disc (DVD) using k3b will likely NOT fix the issue.
2009-03-22T19:55:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: the error is a brasero error. so it should work, no?
2009-03-22T19:56:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 It depends on the error but in my experience the answer is no. It's worth trying though, it's free and I'm guessing you're not on dialup.
2009-03-22T19:57:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: the error/bug - https://bugs.launchpad.net/brasero/+bug/294455 / http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=562740 - i did apt-get install brasero and i "have the latester version".
2009-03-22T19:58:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	I'm not familiar with that error. It won't hurt anything to try k3b, it's easy to install and it can just as easily be removed.
2009-03-22T19:59:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: ok, i will try it then. thanks! :-)
2009-03-22T19:59:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	Welcome.
2009-03-22T19:59:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: ill post back if it works with k3b.
2009-03-22T19:59:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 Ok.
2009-03-22T20:08:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: where can i tick off so the data dvd closes, so that no more data can be burnt to dvd?
2009-03-22T20:10:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	I'm not sure, I don't really use k3b, have you gone through the options/settings/preferences menu?
2009-03-22T20:17:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: i have looked, can't find it, but i have found out that the same bug braero have k3b has. bah! :-/
2009-03-22T20:18:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	Yea I figured that would happen, sorry.
2009-03-22T20:25:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: since both have the bug, then ill just stick with brasero, since the author has replied here: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=562740 - comment #4, and said that the bug is harmless. brasero is trying to re-mount the disc after burning to checksum it, so ill just have to live without that then. however i have another question for you, if you have time: when i have selected the dirs/files to be burnt to an empty dv
2009-03-22T20:28:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	Ask now if you want.
2009-03-22T20:35:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: if i burn a dvd with a file with more than 64 characters will windows not be able to view it? because when i add a 64+ character file, the option "make compatiable with windows system" goes away, and if i try to click it, then it asks for the file to be renamed, which i dont want to do. :-/
2009-03-22T20:37:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 It's been quite some time since I've used Windows but if I remember right unless you rename the file that file will NOT be avaible under windows and possibly the whole disc.
2009-03-22T20:40:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: ok thanks for the info. im not using windows anymore, but the problem is that everyone else uses it. :-P anyways, i dont want to rename my files over 64 char. ;-) thanks for your help! :-)
2009-03-22T20:42:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	If it's just a matter of not manually wanting to rename multiple files there are ways around that. Are the files buried in several folders? if you pull the buried folders to the root directory that will "shorten" the filenames (by reducing the path length).
2009-03-22T20:45:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: the path/files should not be altered. so i should not rename dirs or files, and not change the structure. so i guess, windows users will just have to switch to linux. :-P anyways, nvm. ill just burn it even though its not comp with windows. :-) thanks though! :-)
2009-03-22T20:46:00.000Z	alanbshepard70	kristian2	 You're welcome.
2009-03-22T20:51:00.000Z	kristian2	alanbshepard70	: the only thing that im a bit curious about now is why the latest version of brasero in the repos is 0.8.2 when the latest version of brasero is 2.26.0. that's a lot of versions behind, 0.9.0, 0.9.1, 2.25.90, 2.25.91.1, 2.25.92, and 2.26.0 has been released after the current one in the repo, maybe more between 0.8.2 to 0.9.0 as well. how come?
