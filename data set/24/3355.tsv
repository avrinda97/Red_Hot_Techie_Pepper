2008-02-13T14:30:00.000Z	Bromskloss		Do I need to reinstall Ubuntu?!
2008-02-13T14:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	no - you're just gonna have to mess with your xorg.conf
2008-02-13T14:31:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	Aww, but it worked the first time!
2008-02-13T14:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	then there might be a backup in /etc/X11
2008-02-13T14:31:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	Ok, but it's still weird that I shouldn't be able to do the trick again.
2008-02-13T14:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	go to /etc/X11 and see if there's a backup xorg.conf with a date when it worked
2008-02-13T14:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	then copy that backup to xorg.conf (in the same folder), and try restarting X
2008-02-13T14:33:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	I see a lot of "xorg.conf.1", "xorg.conf.2" etc. Are those the ones I'm looking for?
2008-02-13T14:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	yes -- look at the date to get an idea of which to try
2008-02-13T14:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	those are backups, the one your system uses is plain "xorg.conf".  so you can copy a backup (rename it to just xorg.conf) and try it
2008-02-13T14:34:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	OK. However, all the "backups" seem to be from today.
2008-02-13T14:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	and it never worked today?
2008-02-13T14:35:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	Yes, it did. I just thought I was looking for the date the file was created.
2008-02-13T14:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	with some patience then you can recover it - you really don't need to reinstall. before you start i recommend you copy the whole /etc/X11 folder to your home in case things get messed up
2008-02-13T14:38:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	Too late! ;-) I just replaced xorg.conf with xorg.conf.1 and rebooted (I saw no difference with just Ctrl+Alt+Backspace).
2008-02-13T14:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	any luck?
2008-02-13T14:39:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	It seems so! Thanks a lot.
2008-02-13T14:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	you know those files are readable, so if you know what you changed you can spot it
2008-02-13T14:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	np. it takes some serious messing up to have to reinstall ubuntu
2008-02-13T14:41:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	The strange thing is that it works so nicely from install. It  chooses the right driver and calls the screen model "Custom 1". But then it won't do that again.
2008-02-13T14:42:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	I wonder how I should connect another screen without messing up again.
2008-02-13T14:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	now that you have it working, copy the xorg.conf to xorg.conf.goodbackup or something, in case you change it again
2008-02-13T14:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Bromskloss	i have no idea about multiple screens  - never done it
2008-02-13T14:43:00.000Z	Bromskloss	prince_jammys	OK. Thanks again!
