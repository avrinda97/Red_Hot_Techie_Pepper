2011-09-06T04:35:00.000Z	chaospsychex		u gotta love 'tty'
2011-09-06T04:35:00.000Z	chaospsychex		if that would of been windows i would of have to of rebooted
2011-09-06T04:36:00.000Z	chaospsychex		yeah, if it comes up
2011-09-06T04:36:00.000Z	chaospsychex		or alt-tab or something
2011-09-06T04:38:00.000Z	chaospsychex		as i was asking, why is it when i do 'sudo apt-get upgrade python' it doesn't see 3.1? i have 2.6 installed
2011-09-06T04:39:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	I'm pretty sure it's because 2.6 is the default version. You can install python 3.1 from the Software Center, but don't remove python 2.6. It'll mess stuff up.
2011-09-06T04:42:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	Yes. Programs written with python might freak out. Ubuntu Forums has a lot of threads dealing with people uninstalling 2.6.
2011-09-06T04:43:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	I'm not sure, but I think it's 'python3.1'
2011-09-06T04:45:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	I've heard of it. I'm thinking of installing
2011-09-06T04:45:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	If it's the pop-down terminal thing, I just use ctrl-alt-t instead. Opens up the terminal.
2011-09-06T04:47:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	Compiz controls the cube thing. It controls a lot of other stuff too.
2011-09-06T04:47:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	no it isn't. It draws the desktop (along with nautilus). [I think]
2011-09-06T04:52:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	Install ccsm, then activate "Rotate Cube" and "Desktop Cube"
2011-09-06T04:52:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	to trigger it, switch desktops with ctrl-arrow.
2011-09-06T04:53:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	you have to activate it in ccsm.
2011-09-06T04:57:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	you can do stuff like enable/disable window snap, so on.
2011-09-06T04:57:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	If you look for compiz in Synaptic, you can get more plugins that well let you do stuff like make windows burn up when they close.
2011-09-06T04:58:00.000Z	chaospsychex	iwantfroyo	sounds sick
2011-09-06T04:58:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	window snap is what happens when you bring a window close to an edge. The borders light up with yellow, and you can make a window fit perfectly into half a screen, or full screen by bumping it on the top.
2011-09-06T05:02:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	You might also want to check out AWN (avant-window-navigator in software center), if you get tired of the zoom effect and small icons.
2011-09-06T05:05:00.000Z	chaospsychex	iwantfroyo	i installed the extra compiz plugins, how do i configure them or turn them on ?
2011-09-06T05:06:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	they should turn on by themselves. Just go into ccsm, and look around.
2011-09-06T05:06:00.000Z	iwantfroyo	chaospsychex	You should have a few new sections, and more window management options and effects.
2011-09-06T05:14:00.000Z	chaospsychex	iwantfroyo	i do i invoke the 3dwindow ?
