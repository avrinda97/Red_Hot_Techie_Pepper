2011-07-30T08:04:00.000Z	E-man		Is it just me or does it really take more than an hour to install ubuntu
2011-07-30T08:04:00.000Z	E-man		And then after waiting an hour and a half I get an error message in which I have to do it all over again
2011-07-30T08:05:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Did you verify the image you downloaded via md5sum?
2011-07-30T08:10:00.000Z	E-man	soreau	did you get that?
2011-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Download 11.04 for cd or usb, verify it's md5sum, boot and it make sure it works, then use the install function
2011-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Don't use windows
2011-07-30T08:12:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Install ubuntu alongside windows
2011-07-30T08:12:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Make sure to verify the md5sum of the image you download though
2011-07-30T08:13:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	To be honest, I don;t care why your current method isn't working
2011-07-30T08:18:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Whatever you want
2011-07-30T08:18:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	You can uninstall whatever you did first
2011-07-30T08:18:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	If it's in a separate partition, just install over it
2011-07-30T08:19:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	It all depends on your system
2011-07-30T08:20:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Then there is a bug or you did it wrong
2011-07-30T08:20:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Download the image, check the md5sum and burn it
2011-07-30T08:21:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	The important part is the md5sum. Also, run the built-in cd checker when you first load it
2011-07-30T08:22:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Yes, when you first load the cd, press esc then get to the menu and run the cd checker
2011-07-30T08:24:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	After you first boot the ubuntu live cd
2011-07-30T08:24:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	There will be an icon of a running man and battery (at least that's what it looks like to me) and that's when you press Esc
2011-07-30T08:25:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	But first, check the md5sum before you burn it
2011-07-30T08:25:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	Chances are, the cd checker will pass without error if you checked the md5sum and using a good disc and burner
2011-07-30T08:26:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	AFAICT, you're doing it wrong
2011-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	soreau	E-man	AFAICT = As Far As I Can Tell
2011-07-30T09:37:00.000Z	E-man	soreau	you there?
