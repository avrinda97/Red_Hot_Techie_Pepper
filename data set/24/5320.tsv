2006-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	yes?
2006-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	What is the question?
2006-11-01T13:41:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	?
2006-11-01T13:41:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	apologies; phone call.
2006-11-01T13:42:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	It is possible depending on what router you have.
2006-11-01T13:42:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	What type of wireless router are you using?
2006-11-01T13:43:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	hmm.
2006-11-01T13:43:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	It really all depends on what type of router you have; some routers can connect "as clients" to other routers.
2006-11-01T13:44:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	Like a cracked Version of a linksys router can do that.
2006-11-01T13:44:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	I know its possible; but unsure of how to do it with your specific connection.
2006-11-01T13:45:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	ok, i will list the possible settings for sharing
2006-11-01T13:46:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	so its client dependant?
2006-11-01T13:46:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	its router dependant
2006-11-01T13:47:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	yea ok, but the wireless modem doesnt matter right, its about the device i want to act as repeater
2006-11-01T13:47:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	oh - soy ou want your laptop to "relay" the wireless connection?
2006-11-01T13:48:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	nope, i mean 'client' like in router which has to connect to the modem over wifi
2006-11-01T13:48:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	yeah. It depends on the "router" acting as a "wireless client"
2006-11-01T13:49:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	Linksys with cracked firmware can do it easy.
2006-11-01T13:49:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	Cisco makes WGB (Work Group Bridges) just for that purpose
2006-11-01T13:52:00.000Z	MitchM	tijn_	Station-Adhoc would probably be your best bet.
2006-11-01T13:55:00.000Z	tijn_	MitchM	hmm lan ports arent asosiated i think :(
