2012-09-09T02:24:00.000Z	subman		I'm running ubuntu 12.04 and firefox 15.0 and was watching veetle.com content just fine.  Suddenly I now I cannot completely resolve the page.  Anyone else have this issue?
2012-09-09T02:24:00.000Z	Meris	subman	please give the exact URL you were watchin, so I can test it.
2012-09-09T02:25:00.000Z	Meris	subman	watchin => watching
2012-09-09T02:34:00.000Z	subman	Meris	http://veetle.com/index.php/listing/index/entertainment
2012-09-09T02:34:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I get the top bar down to Entertainment/Popular/New and then a huge white space.  I also get their page links at the bottom.  Just how content in between
2012-09-09T02:35:00.000Z	Meris	subman	I see various screenshots of movies, with a "play" sign superimposed on it when I hover over the thumbnails. subman, do you have noscript installed, by any chance?
2012-09-09T02:36:00.000Z	Meris	subman	I can play a movie if I click on the play sign.
2012-09-09T02:37:00.000Z	Meris	subman	it is awfully laggy though. Either many people are requesting the vid or the bandwidth provided by veetle.com just isn't enough...
2012-09-09T02:37:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I used to be able to play them as well early today.  Just not now.  I did do a recent update.  Yes I'm running NoScript but have Allowed this .com site.
2012-09-09T02:38:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I don't even get the boxes with shots of the movies in them.  Just whitespace
2012-09-09T02:39:00.000Z	Meris	subman	1) do you have Adobe Flash Player + all codecs installed from the "ugly" set?
2012-09-09T02:40:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I must as I could play the movies earlier today.
2012-09-09T02:41:00.000Z	Meris	subman	in that case, try clearing the Firefox cache by using Ctrl + Shift + Del. Afterwards close all FF windows and reopen FF again
2012-09-09T02:42:00.000Z	subman	Meris	nope, still no luck
2012-09-09T02:44:00.000Z	Meris	subman	one thing: I did not login to Facebook prior to watching the movie. This may or may not make any difference. I don't have a FB account and I don't plan to.
2012-09-09T02:44:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I have no Facebook account either and it worked fine earlier today
2012-09-09T02:45:00.000Z	subman	Meris	I have another computer here and it works fine on it (running Lubuntu).
2012-09-09T02:46:00.000Z	Meris	subman	 try running FF from the command-line to see if the Adobe Flash module spits out any error messages so you can diagnose the issue.
2012-09-09T02:46:00.000Z	subman	Meris	have you updated today?
2012-09-09T02:48:00.000Z	subman	Meris	No errors but it works now when started via command line
2012-09-09T02:49:00.000Z	subman	Meris	and now it works by clicking on the icon.  Very, very strange
2012-09-09T02:50:00.000Z	Meris	subman	Well, it does work. Maybe some cookie needed to reset itself or something similar. Flash Player is a black box and that is exactly the problem...
2012-09-09T02:51:00.000Z	subman	Meris	Yup, go you.  Thanks for the help!
2012-09-09T02:51:00.000Z	Meris	subman	glad to help :-)
