2005-02-03T14:20:00.000Z	DAC1138		the default ubuntu kernel source
2005-02-03T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	for warty or hoary?
2005-02-03T14:21:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	linux-source-2.6.8.1
2005-02-03T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	do you have the 'main' repository enabled?
2005-02-03T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	you need to enable 'main'
2005-02-03T14:25:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	because the installer doesn't assume that the target computer has a live Internet connection unless you tell it so during the install.
2005-02-03T14:27:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	sudo aptitude install linux-source-2.6.8.1
2005-02-03T14:27:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	you need to enable warty-security as well
2005-02-03T14:28:00.000Z	DAC1138	crimsun	thanks a bunch, its downloading
2005-02-03T14:29:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	excellent.
2005-02-03T16:09:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	linux-source-2.6.8.1 _is_ the source
2005-02-03T16:10:00.000Z	DAC1138	crimsun	its 2.6.8-1-3-386, according to the modules
2005-02-03T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	that's because -3-386 is the EXTRAVERSION appended
2005-02-03T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	DAC1138	correct.
2005-07-26T08:17:00.000Z	DAC1138	crimsun	sure thing, i was just wondering what he's on about. im done
