2006-08-25T07:27:00.000Z	thomasB		hey, natulius isn't working for me, are there any other FTP clients for ubuntu?
2006-08-25T07:27:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	try typing "ftp" into a Terminal :)
2006-08-25T07:28:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	that doesn't help me :) i'm almost completely reliant on GUI to do anything
2006-08-25T07:29:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	not that hard.  just type "ftp ftp.whatever.com" then you just "cd /whatever/directory/you/want" then "bin" then "get whatever"
2006-08-25T07:30:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	thanks
2006-08-25T07:32:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	what's the command to upload?
2006-08-25T07:33:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	"put whatever"
2006-08-25T07:34:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	if it's a text file/HTML file/something like that you want to put "a" then "put whatever"; if it's a binary you want "bin" then "put whatever"
2006-08-25T07:35:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	a put filename.xml             ??  do i need to put /home/username/filename.xml?
2006-08-25T07:38:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	i'm doing something wrong.  i get   local: put remote: [whatever i type in]   local: put: no such file or directory
2006-08-25T07:41:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	ftp> put messages                   local: messages remote: messages           .....                   290894 bytes sent in 0.02 secs (13367.0 kB/s)
2006-08-25T07:42:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	i'm sorry for being so worthless but i don't understand what you just said
2006-08-25T07:42:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	that was my ftp output
2006-08-25T07:42:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	just type "put filename"
2006-08-25T07:42:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	nothing more
2006-08-25T07:42:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	see if that works
2006-08-25T07:43:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	200 PORT command successful
2006-08-25T07:43:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	hmm
2006-08-25T07:44:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	I get 200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.                                150 Ok to send data.                              226 File receive OK.
2006-08-25T07:48:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	gftp does the same thing (stalls) got any suggestions on where to go?
2006-08-25T07:48:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	Sounds like a server problem, not your problem
2006-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	unless of course that's your server :)
2006-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	AWOSDev	thomasB	have you tried Firefox?
2006-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	thomasB	AWOSDev	yeah, i know it's something on my end, my laptop can connect and transfer fine
