2005-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	elad`		I really need to get out of X.
2005-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	elad`		Well, not really. But I really want to.
2005-09-25T12:03:00.000Z	elad`		So, how do I get out of X. Get me something to type at a shell.
2005-09-25T12:03:00.000Z	elad`		Is terminating X's PID unclean?
2005-09-25T12:03:00.000Z	darkheart	elad`	Try 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
2005-09-25T12:04:00.000Z	elad`		Why does sudo require a passowrd different than su's?
2005-09-25T12:05:00.000Z	elad`		What? Isn't that effectively making all users (or the first one - whatever) root?
2005-09-25T12:06:00.000Z	elad`	Amaranth	no, this isn't working.
2005-09-25T12:06:00.000Z	elad`		I'll try the sudo gdm stop as soon as I get an answer to my other questions.
2005-09-25T12:07:00.000Z	elad`	Amaranth	how did you fix it the first time?
2005-09-25T12:07:00.000Z	elad`		The other question was the sense of making the normal user a root.
2005-09-25T12:08:00.000Z	elad`		But I use the same password, so I'm effectively root.
2005-09-25T12:08:00.000Z	elad`		Well, let's try the gdm stop. How do I get back after that, btw?
2005-09-25T12:09:00.000Z	darkheart	elad`	You misunderstand sudo. It's a tool to allow user some root privileges. If the password was the same as root, then it defeats the purpose.
2005-09-25T12:09:00.000Z	elad`		elad@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop sudo: /etc/init.d/gdm: command not found
2005-09-25T12:09:00.000Z	darkheart	elad`	To get back, 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start'
2005-09-25T12:10:00.000Z	elad`		elad@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ /etc/init.d/kdm stop

2005-09-25T12:10:00.000Z	elad`		I was going to cut the <enter>s
2005-09-25T12:11:00.000Z	darkheart	elad`	What WM do you use?
2005-09-25T12:12:00.000Z	darkheart	elad`	Do you use a display manager?
