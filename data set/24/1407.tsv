2010-02-18T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ericjames: just incase the new one doesn't work you can roll back.
2010-02-18T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ericjames: after uninstalling it you will need to run: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove ,to remove the modules
2010-02-18T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ericjames: you will gain about 120Mb of space back too
2010-02-18T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ericjames: if your current kernel is 100% fine then the other one is dead weight

2010-02-18T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Djrobbie: websearch a few of the lines, see what you find
2010-02-18T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ericjames: you can but when a new kernel is added the change will be lost as grub.cfg is generated
2010-02-18T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!info webkitgtk

2010-02-19T00:18:00.000Z	seanbrystone	ActionParsnip	nope i did sudo dpkg -l ttf-dejavu, it shows it's not installed
2010-02-19T00:22:00.000Z	seanbrystone	ActionParsnip	im not sure how to recreate the font, but i tried installing ttf-dejavu and ttf-dejavu-extra and it gets dependency errors
2010-02-19T00:24:00.000Z	seanbrystone	ActionParsnip	not sure what folder fonts go

2010-03-08T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanbrystone	you can just restore from your backups, you can also use foremost if you have failed to make any backups
2010-03-08T05:02:00.000Z	seanbrystone	ActionParsnip	yeah theres no backups, and what do you mean, "restore from your backups"?
2010-03-08T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanbrystone	you can run foremost in a livecd so the partition is not busy
2010-03-08T05:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanbrystone	if your data is important then you should have a backup system
2010-03-08T05:03:00.000Z	seanbrystone	ActionParsnip	I keep two backups actually (that i forgot about) sbackup and back in time, thanks for reminding me, i had a duh moment! :)
2010-03-08T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seanbrystone	backups will always save the day :)
