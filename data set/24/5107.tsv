2006-11-07T13:17:00.000Z	jirwin		hey there
2006-11-07T13:18:00.000Z	jirwin		I am trying to play a video in vlc(in Edgy), and can't seem to get sound to work. VLC is outputting the following: [00000342]  alsa audio output error: write failed (Broken pipe)
2006-11-07T13:18:00.000Z	jirwin		any ideas?
2006-11-07T13:18:00.000Z	jirwin		sound does work everywhere else on the computer(just no videos, even with mplayer and totem)
2006-11-07T13:19:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	have you tried different video formats?
2006-11-07T13:19:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	this is something that just stopped working. It did work just fine 20 minutes ago
2006-11-07T13:20:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	does that involve multiple x sessions?
2006-11-07T13:20:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	yah
2006-11-07T13:20:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	and are you using OSS?
2006-11-07T13:20:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	because you're not using alsa ;)
2006-11-07T13:21:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	multiple sound cards?
2006-11-07T13:22:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	do you have no sound regardless of which 'head' the movie player is on?
2006-11-07T13:25:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	ok, I move it to the second monitor and it doesn't even play. It dies
2006-11-07T13:30:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	any other ideas?
2006-11-07T13:30:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	nay. i dont have multihead
2006-11-07T13:30:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	time to crawl through your logs :p
2006-11-07T13:31:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	the first thing id do would be to switch back to 'single head' and see if that fixes the problem
2006-11-07T13:36:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	yup, going back to single-head fixed it.
2006-11-07T13:37:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	so, how would I change to OSS?
2006-11-07T13:37:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	dont. it'd be worse. so much worse. you'll cry and curse my name
2006-11-07T13:37:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	i was going to blame your problem on it
2006-11-07T13:37:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	any ideas on how to fix it then?
2006-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	jirwin	Tompu	maybe xinerama is the solution
2006-11-07T13:47:00.000Z	Tompu	jirwin	perhaps. i know nothing about your problem. the logs should guide you though. believe in the logs. trust the logs. etc.
