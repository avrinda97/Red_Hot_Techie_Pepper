2008-10-10T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	quick test, when the system hangs can you press the caps lock button and make the keyboard light coem on /off
2008-10-10T14:10:00.000Z	vicky1408	ikonia	are you there?
2008-10-10T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	ok, so it's a total hard lock, the most common cause for that is a minor hardware issue, so what I'd suggest doing is when you boot the cd select the "memtest" option, this will take a long time to run, approxy 12- 24 hours
2008-10-10T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	but this will give you a quick scan of your memory in your machine to get an solid understanding it's "ok"
2008-10-10T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	thats not ram
2008-10-10T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	how much ram (not disk) do you have
2008-10-10T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	your on the limit of what the installer needs
2008-10-10T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	you can either run the memcheck option to test it, or use the "alternative cd" to do an instal
2008-10-10T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	yes, and your on the limit of the minimum required
2008-10-10T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	so a.) check your memory is "ok" with memcheck
2008-10-10T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	b.) consider using the alternative install disk, that users less memory
2008-10-10T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	no you can't use linux in windows
2008-10-10T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	you heard wrong
2008-10-10T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	well, in that case you are right, things like DSL use less memory, if you join ##linux you'll get more info
2008-10-10T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	you may want to join ##linux to discuss that
2008-10-10T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	this channel is for ubuntu specific questions only
2008-10-10T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	type "/join ##liunux"
2008-10-10T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	##linux is another channel, this one is called #ubuntu
2008-10-10T14:19:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	that should read "join ##linux"
2008-10-10T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	vicky1408	sorry "/join ##linux"
