2009-07-28T07:18:00.000Z	losher	DougM	I thought the linux client for Ventrillo isn't released yet...
2009-07-28T07:19:00.000Z	DougM	losher	thats what i am seeing.  I did notice someone online talking about using "wine" to install it.  Again im really new to Ubuntu (about an hour now haha) so i have no idea what they are takling abut but im going ot look into it
2009-07-28T07:20:00.000Z	losher	DougM	wine is a linux application that lets your run *some* (but by no means all) windows apps under Ubuntu.
2009-07-28T07:21:00.000Z	DougM	losher	hmm im going to look into it. See what I can come up with beacuse Ventrillo is something i somewhat need but if i cant get it i cant get it
