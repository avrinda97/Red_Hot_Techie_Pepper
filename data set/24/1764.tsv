2009-09-03T19:43:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	active i believe
2009-09-03T19:44:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	its active for boot.
2009-09-03T19:46:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	if you need more clarification pastebin your fdisk -l output

2009-09-03T19:49:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	ok, its saying that you have two physical drives, only one partition on each can be active for boot, and the first drive will the be active partition to actually boot. the other may be marked bootable but will not boot by default. the "*" indicates that is the active bootable partition on that physical drive.
2009-09-03T19:52:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	sorry but dont understand cuz i have another linuxmint partition that aint "*"ed and i regularly get into that one since my main one messed up with this whole problem. im currently in the 5 gig one.
2009-09-03T19:54:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	ok, well that is possible.... I mean the partition marked "*" is the boot partition, you can still boot other OS's on other partitions, but the marked partition holds the actual boot data, for instance... I may have Vista, XP, Ubuntu and Fedora, all are bootable, however only one partition holds grum bootloader, and that is my first partition, /dev/sda1 and it is marked "*"
2009-09-03T19:55:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	more important to you , if clearly defining your problem.... because grub can be reinstalled/configured
2009-09-03T19:56:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	now that confused me even more cuz my first linux install is in sda1
2009-09-03T19:56:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	shouldnt that one be marked?
2009-09-03T19:57:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	the only way for me help is to know what went wrong... what you the user did to attempt to remedy it and where you need to go, if you can answer me that, then i can probably help you. and yes "normally" sda1 is the boot but in some cases its not. like yours apparently
2009-09-03T19:57:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	do you know much bout grub 2?
2009-09-03T19:58:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	well dont wanna waste to much of your time cuz some1 else already pointed me into a direction of possible remedy. so ill try that solution and see if it works.
2009-09-03T20:00:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	no, not grub2
2009-09-03T20:00:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	i hear 2 is completely different animal
2009-09-03T20:00:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	no just wonderin if it could help if i upgraded
2009-09-03T20:01:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	no need for it.
2009-09-03T20:01:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	yea saw it had some improvements
2009-09-03T20:01:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	that applies to more than after a windows install, it applies to everything , and will help you in re-configuring grub
2009-09-03T20:02:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	already saw that after a different debacle with stupid vista and its partitioning "security"
2009-09-03T20:04:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	how about hilo or holu or whatever the hell its called , the other bootloader. is it an better or worse?
2009-09-03T20:06:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	lilo? lol
2009-09-03T20:07:00.000Z	tj83_	KushedVapors	i am at work, so i will offer some time to help you, but at a snails pace. if you got the time... I invite you to  #seaphor
2009-09-03T20:07:00.000Z	KushedVapors	tj83_	yea, at least i got the l in the middle part  :D
