2009-12-30T12:04:00.000Z	cjae		so I am running kde 4.3.2 and installed kgpg and it doesnt seem to work with this bug http://www.mail-archive.com/kubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg26884.html  How would I go about installing a newer or older version  of kgpg since it is part of kde-utils, would  I have to enable the ppa for kde 4.4?
2009-12-30T12:05:00.000Z	cjae		I am looking here since someone told me to look there yesterday but cant seem to find answer https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-members-kde4/+archive/ppa
2009-12-30T12:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	you reallyneed to be in #kubuntu to get advice on kubuntu
2010-01-15T05:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	I use revelation
2010-01-15T05:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	If you're looking for a gui password manager, try Revelation from the repos
2010-01-15T05:11:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	gtk?
2010-01-15T05:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	yes
2010-01-15T05:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	I blogged about revelation: http://ardchoille42.blogspot.com/2009/08/managing-user-names-and-passwords.html
2010-01-15T05:12:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	know of of qt one by chance? asked in #kubuntu as well
2010-01-15T05:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	pen a terminal and run: apt-cache search password | grep manager
2010-01-15T05:21:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	how can I use aptitude search or apt-cache search to see if the manage is designed for kde  tried apt-cache policy mypasswordsafe
2010-01-15T05:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	you can use apt-cache show appname and then see what the dependies are
2010-01-15T05:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	mypasswordsafe looks like a kde app
2010-01-15T05:24:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	that "show" is a handy option
2010-01-15T05:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	keepassx also looks good for kde
2010-01-15T05:25:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	tried keepassx, since pwmanager is not in karmic anymore but it could not properly import .pwm file so I dont think ill use it
2010-01-15T05:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	yeah, it's a shame that pwmanager was removed. But you might be able to compile it from sources
2010-01-15T05:26:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	filled bug against keepassx, noticed that there was a similar bug in 2007 @sourceforge bugs
2010-01-15T05:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	hey, just found something for pwmanager, have a look: http://passwordmanager.sourceforge.net/download.php
2010-01-15T05:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	seems there are packages for kubuntu
2010-01-15T05:40:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	yeah I  took a look a getting it installed but have to install kde3 files and will probably move on to a new app
2010-01-15T05:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	cjae	Ah, yeah, probably best to move on
2010-01-15T05:42:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	thanks
2010-01-15T05:42:00.000Z	cjae	ardchoille	show was very helpful
