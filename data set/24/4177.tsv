2009-08-30T14:18:00.000Z	rabidweezle		brasero works?
2009-08-30T14:18:00.000Z	rabidweezle		use imgburn in windows
2009-08-30T14:18:00.000Z	rabidweezle		imgburn is the best, and it's free
2009-08-30T14:18:00.000Z	rabidweezle		trust me
2009-08-30T14:19:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I even use imgburn in linux using wine because it's very good for "certain" images
2009-08-30T14:20:00.000Z	rabidweezle		oh
2009-08-30T14:20:00.000Z	rabidweezle		:(
2009-08-30T14:21:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I use wine for imgburn and call of duty 2 :/
2009-08-30T14:22:00.000Z	rabidweezle		sudo apt-get install apache2
2009-08-30T14:22:00.000Z	rabidweezle		apache doesn't require much to run, I ran it on an xbox...
2009-08-30T14:23:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	i know but its just funny to think webserver and netbook in the same sentence.
2009-08-30T14:23:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	they are 1.6 ghz, and a gig of ram I think, they could handle it easy
2009-08-30T14:23:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	but I get your point
2009-08-30T14:24:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	haha yeah!
2009-08-30T14:26:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	I always used firestarter for that stuff
2009-08-30T14:26:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	i always thought it was for firewall only
2009-08-30T14:30:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	good deal
2009-08-30T14:31:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	does firestarter have a web interface too? i am running ubuntu server so there is no GUI.
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	what about port forwarding? essentially if i set my server up as a nat, im going to have to forward ports with it too.. correct?
2009-08-30T14:32:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	does your server have X installed? if you do, you can just run a vlc client, use firestarter then shut down X
2009-08-30T14:33:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	i dont have X installed. just the essentials, a webserver, ftp, vpn, samba, print server- you get the picture. haha. its all managed through SSH.
2009-08-30T14:34:00.000Z	rabidweezle	javaTN	then read through that, I'm sure it has been asked about 200 times on the forums and all
2009-08-30T14:35:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	im  browsing through it. im just frusterated right now because i spent the last 3 hours tinkering with my server and its now 5:35 AM- still haven't slept. and i just want to get this darn thing setup.
2009-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	javaTN	rabidweezle	im also stuck trying to figure out how to get my router to cooperate with my server. its just head spinning information.
