2008-09-29T00:45:00.000Z	amanulla		where can i get this "version of Slax called Frodo, without big applications, that fits in 41MB, or choose among the 200MB standard editions such as Killbill (which I use) or PopCorn."
2008-09-29T00:45:00.000Z	amanulla		can any one plssssssssss
2008-09-29T00:46:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	unfortunately - we can only support ubuntu in here - does Slax not have a support channel?
2008-10-01T22:44:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	5 GB for / and that being the only partition for ubuntu is probably a little low - you could easily run out of space
2008-10-01T23:08:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	try.  sudo blkid
2008-10-01T23:09:00.000Z	amanulla	unop	sudo blkid ""  bash: sudp: command not found
2008-10-01T23:10:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	sudp ??
2008-10-01T23:13:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	i'm not sure what you mean exactly - but i'll say yes
2008-10-01T23:14:00.000Z	amanulla	unop	i mean to move over all my drives in my system using terminal can i?
2008-10-01T23:15:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	hmm, again - that's quite ambiguous - what do you mean move all drives over?
2008-10-01T23:17:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	ok, i see this - now what do you want to do?
2008-10-01T23:18:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	i guess - but i can't tell which are for which ubuntu and whether or not the NTFS ones are for windows, but perhaps you do. ok, but go on
2008-10-01T23:19:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	if you are speaking to me, put my name down so your messages are highlighted
2008-10-01T23:21:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	you don't have to move the file over just to edit it - you can edit it under sudo with one of these commands.   sudo nano /path/to/the/other/xorg.conf
2008-10-01T23:22:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	or if you prefer gedit.  gksudo gedit /path/to/that/xorg.conf
2008-10-01T23:23:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	this command runs nano - but edits the xorg.conf on the other ubuntu - just make sure you give the right path name there
2008-10-01T23:23:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	you don't need to - just run your editor under sudo
2008-10-01T23:25:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	you don't need to take root access of the other ubuntu - all you need is root access on the ubuntu you are currently on.
2008-10-01T23:28:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	did you use sudo??
2008-10-01T23:28:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	you are not using sudo
2008-10-01T23:29:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	well, you can't do that - you have to launch your editor under sudo or gksudo (to make the editor run under root)
2008-10-01T23:29:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	 alt+f2  .. then type  gksudo gedit
2008-10-01T23:29:00.000Z	unop	amanulla	then file -> open , etc
