2005-08-31T15:59:00.000Z	ompaul	misfit_toy	have a look at the debian educational stuff it is useful
2005-09-01T16:01:00.000Z	misfit_toy	ompaul	do you know the package name for debian educational games? or is it a one by one thing?
2005-09-01T16:01:00.000Z	ompaul	misfit_toy	also www.squeakland.org <-- a little messy to setup after you do the obvious dpkg -i the two packages it needs a bundle of updates but then it was great
