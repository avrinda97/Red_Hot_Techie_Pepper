2008-05-02T05:32:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	Have you run the .run file and completed the install?
2008-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	Alright, we'll walk through it.  You're either logged in or looking at a login screen correct?  (black and white screen as you don't have X running)
2008-05-02T05:35:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	alright log in if you haven't.  You should be in your home directory.
2008-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	 try this:  'cd Desktop' then type 'ls *.run'
2008-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	Make sure you're in the same folder as the .run file.  If you are, run the command Pelo gave you.  That makes it executable.
2008-05-02T05:39:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	You will also need to prepend the 'sh  NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.05-pkg#.run' command with 'sudo'.
2008-05-02T05:41:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	did it list your file?  I ask because the Desktop is the default download dir for Firefox..
2008-05-02T05:42:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	 Ah, alright, if it spit the name back then you're in the right spot.  run the command Pelo gave you 'chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.05-pkg1.run'
2008-05-02T05:46:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	run this: 'sudo sh ./runNVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.05-pkg1.run'
2008-05-02T05:48:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	the filename isn't runNVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.05-pkg1.run
2008-05-02T06:02:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	join #zionpsyfer.
2008-05-02T06:07:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	rejoin.
2008-05-02T06:08:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	Hi, rejoin #zionpsyfer
2008-05-02T08:41:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	harris	1024x768 would be a good starter.  Use the nvidia control panel to set it.
