2009-04-01T21:31:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	sure, with nm applet
2009-04-01T21:32:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	what is a nm applet?
2009-04-01T21:32:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	or wifi-radar
2009-04-01T21:32:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	network manager ;)
2009-04-01T21:33:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	you can actually view wireless networks by issuing "iwlist scan"
2009-04-01T21:34:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	ok so my wless has the wrong driver i think
2009-04-01T21:34:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	Your wlan card doesn't work?
2009-04-01T21:34:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	it is not scanning
2009-04-01T21:35:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	it is a broadcom 43XX and this is a known problem i think
2009-04-01T21:35:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	cool, i got bcm4311, the cards work ;)
2009-04-01T21:36:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	goto Hardware Drivers
2009-04-01T21:36:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	is it a new card or an older one?
2009-04-01T21:36:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	And choose b43 driver for your card. what distro you on btw.?
2009-04-01T21:37:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	8.04 .  it wants to know if it should extrach firmware?
2009-04-01T21:37:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	I think you don't, it was before that we needed to do it...
2009-04-01T21:38:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	Why don't you check that? (Hardware Drivers)
2009-04-01T21:40:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	I'm here for only 10mins more if you need help...
2009-04-01T21:40:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	i did.  it seems the proprietary drivers were not enabled.  i enabled them , it dlded a file, and asked to extract firmware.  i didnot check that box and continued, and then it went back to Hardware manager and still has no proprietary driver enabled
2009-04-01T21:41:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	Yes, check the extraction!
2009-04-01T21:41:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	sorry but how?
2009-04-01T21:41:00.000Z	archman	LargePrime	It will do everything automatically, i think, i don't remember really...
2009-04-01T21:41:00.000Z	LargePrime	archman	ofcourse.  one sec
