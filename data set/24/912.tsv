2010-11-03T03:12:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	no not a good idea at all.
2010-11-03T03:13:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	I recommend going to 10.04 if you need LTS
2010-11-03T03:13:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	so an upgrad to 10.04 is easily doable?
2010-11-03T03:13:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	Doable? Yes, but I seriously recommend formatting.
2010-11-03T03:14:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	it's a disaster if you skip versions like that.
2010-11-03T03:15:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	it is just a virtualbox image, i did a snapshot :)
2010-11-03T03:16:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	oh LOL! I thought you must have been dealing with a server or something. XD
2010-11-03T03:16:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	ok :D - its just that i want to try if this would work - so i installed myself now a clean 6.06
2010-11-03T03:16:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	ok then, give it your best shot. Hope it works. ;)
2010-11-03T03:24:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	when i directly get the maverick package list, the old apt-get fails parsing them
2010-11-03T03:24:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	hmm...
2010-11-03T03:24:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	would you mind jumping updates?
2010-11-03T03:25:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	you could jump to 7.04 > 8.04 > 9.04 > 10.04 > 10.10. :P
2010-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	this would be too boring :D
2010-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	LOL! :D
2010-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	you could grab a new version of apt...
2010-11-03T03:26:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	but seriously, you'd be replacing 50% of the system just doing that.
2010-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	thats what i checked right now, the deps are qute huge
2010-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	yeah...
2010-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	are you doing this just for fun? :P
2010-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	yes
2010-11-03T03:29:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	ok. ;)
2010-11-03T03:32:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	mlq	seems like a lot of trouble to do. When I get that itch to do something I usually get involved with either helping with Ubuntu or take a small distro (aka Puppy) and turning it into a full fledged desktop OS.
2010-11-03T03:54:00.000Z	mlq	Sir_Konrad	ok, i guess i will give it another try tomorrow - i know build a newer apt version, but the checksums are failing :\
