2006-01-28T08:22:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		Hey, I just installed ubuntu and I use 2 monitors from one ghpx card - one is displaying 1280x1024 ok but the other is 'zoomed in' and you move the mouse to look around - how can I get around that?
2006-01-28T08:23:00.000Z	Cyorxamp		does anyone know?

2006-01-28T08:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Cyorxamp	edit xorg.conf and make sure the 2nd monitor gets a different resolution...
2006-01-28T08:30:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	ubuntu thinks I only have one monitor I think - it beleives the res is 1280x1024
2006-01-28T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Cyorxamp	then you'll have to teach ubuntu by editing xorg.conf
2006-01-28T08:31:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	in what way?
2006-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	thats quite a statement
2006-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	nonsense
2006-01-28T08:40:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	you have told me to edit the xorg.cong file - without even saying how
2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	I have the file up - but I dunno what bit needs changing
2006-01-28T08:46:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	I agree
2006-03-08T16:13:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	might you know the answer to my woe's ?
2006-03-10T17:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Cyorxamp	yes, very bizarre indeeed but please move on with life and forget it 
2006-03-10T17:47:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	do u know anything bout the gnome menu and/or the whole .desktop files thing?
2006-03-10T17:47:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	got a conundrum :P
2006-05-27T14:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Cyorxamp	the question is: will vista be a viable competitor to Ubuntu
2006-05-27T14:34:00.000Z	Cyorxamp	Seveas	- thats not my question
