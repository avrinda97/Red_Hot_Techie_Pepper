2008-03-26T22:20:00.000Z	leeping2008		Hi there, I seem to be encountering problems when I source scripts (that contain environment variables).  The environment variables don't seem to be exported at all!  What do I do?
2008-03-26T22:22:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	ask the guys in #bash, they might know
2008-03-26T22:22:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	thanks. :)
2008-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	ssh user@localhost 'cd /tmp && bash -i'
2008-08-22T20:53:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	thanks!
2008-09-04T03:42:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	verify.  dpkg -l | grep libglib
2008-09-04T03:43:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	can I force the install if I wanted to?
2008-09-04T03:43:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	from what you have there libglib1.2 is not installed
2008-09-04T03:44:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	if you forced it, it wouldn't work properly
2008-09-04T03:44:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	I see.  From my experience, usually programs ask for the packages that end in "dev", but in this case ..
2008-09-04T03:44:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	okay, I'll see if I can find a .deb package for libglib1.2.  It isn't on the repository, afaik
2008-09-04T03:45:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	*-dev packages are not compiled libraries - they are just the headers you use for building stuff
2008-09-04T03:46:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	I see.  If I need libglib1.2 and it isn't on the repository, where can I find it?
2008-09-04T03:47:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	you're right, libglib1.2 isn't in the repos.  I believe it's because it has been phased out (as is xmms) .. you could grab it off of http://packages.ubuntu.com but i wouldn't recommend it
2008-09-04T03:48:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	I really liked xmms.  vlc has these intermittent popping noises, which I think is an issue with the player, I'd like to try xmms (which is what I used when I had dapper...)
2008-09-04T03:49:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	xmms is no longer supported by debian/ubuntu anymore
2008-09-04T03:50:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	darn .. I guess I won't be getting any support in my quest then :)
2008-09-04T03:51:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	you might like aqualung .. it's somewhat like xmms
2008-09-04T04:02:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	your xmms will likely not work properly without libglib1.2
2008-09-04T04:03:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	when I type in "ldd", all the links are still active .. yet xmms doesn't work, you're right :(
2008-09-04T04:06:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	if I wanted to get xmms installed, i would port xmms from gutsy - add the gutsy deb-src repos and do something like.  sudo aptitude update && sudo apt-get build-dep xmms && cd /usr/src && sudo apt-get source -b xmms
2008-09-04T04:07:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	thanks for the tip. :)  I have to call the gf now, but I will save the line that you just typed
2008-09-13T04:45:00.000Z	unop	leeping2008	is that a trick question?  #fortran exists
2008-09-13T04:45:00.000Z	leeping2008	unop	there's like no one in there :P
