2009-11-15T06:46:00.000Z	skoyles		when I take off the quiet splash modifier, it goes through a bunch of text, and then just stops
2009-11-15T06:47:00.000Z	skoyles		says end_request IO erorr, def, fd0, sector 0
2009-11-15T06:47:00.000Z	skoyles		what does this mean?
2009-11-15T06:49:00.000Z	skoyles		people sure do have a lot of problems, considering Ubuntu is supposed to be the easiest most user friendly linux distro
2009-11-15T06:50:00.000Z	skoyles		arix007 -- save yourself the headache and get a mac.
2009-11-15T06:51:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	trolling?
2009-11-15T06:51:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, I'm frustrated.
2009-11-15T06:52:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	ok. i also can say only 1 thing: be patient
2009-11-15T06:52:00.000Z	skoyles		i'm trying to give this ubuntu thing a fair shot. but it wont even install
2009-11-15T06:52:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, am being patient. have left the installer sitting idle for 30 mins. It's hung. so now I'm turning here for help bc it appears to be the only resource
2009-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	skoyles		but this is like a cottage industry of tech support.
2009-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	have you tried the alternate install cd?
2009-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, I'm using the one I dl'ed from the website. didn't see an alternate. what's the difference?
2009-11-15T06:54:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, I see there are other install options, but I have no idea what they mean. such as: acpi=off, noapic, nolapic, edd=on..... ??? How am I supposed to know what these mean?
2009-11-15T06:54:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	the alternate it's just a text installer. it doesnt load any graphics
2009-11-15T06:55:00.000Z	skoyles		thatoneguy, I'm having the SAME PROBLEM!
2009-11-15T06:56:00.000Z	skoyles	ThatOneGuy	yup, exactly. click on load, and it just gets hung with the little animation thing that stops going across
2009-11-15T06:56:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	give it a try: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#alternate
2009-11-15T06:57:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	it's not as simple as the live cd installer, but it will at least load
2009-11-15T06:58:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, thank you very much. I'll try this. How about Wubi? is that any good
2009-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	yeah, why not. it will be a little bit slow but that's a good option for a beginner
2009-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	try wubi then
2009-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	skoyles		koston, trying wubi now.
2009-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	kostkon	skoyles	:)
