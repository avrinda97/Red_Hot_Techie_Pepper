2010-03-26T06:48:00.000Z	Purp1e		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows this one to be precise
2010-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	Purp1e		When I go to grub it loads almost instantly
2010-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	Purp1e		I think theres something going wrong here because I dont see the usual probing devices
2010-03-26T06:49:00.000Z	aetaric	Purp1e	i think it is just reading from the map
2010-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	Purp1e		And then when I type root (hd0,3) which is where grub is, it says the disk doesnt exist....
2010-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	aetaric		oh.
2010-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	Purp1e		Error 21
2010-03-26T06:50:00.000Z	Purp1e		Im on my live cd right now so you can give me commands if need be
2010-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	aetaric	Purp1e	find /vmlinuz
2010-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	aetaric		see if it returns a disk
2010-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	Purp1e		It returns /vmlinuz
2010-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	Purp1e		Wait
2010-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	Purp1e		Do i enter that in grub or normal terminal?
2010-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	Purp1e		In grub I get Error 15: File not found
2010-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	aetaric		oh you are running from a live cd......... that would be done in grub
2010-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	aetaric		i'm clueless......
2010-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	Purp1e		Ill try remounting my partitions
2010-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	aetaric		then again the last time i made that mistake was on 6.10 >.<
2010-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	Purp1e		This is a regular thing for me lol
2010-03-26T06:54:00.000Z	Purp1e		I have to sync my zune every 2 or so months
2010-03-26T06:55:00.000Z	Purp1e		Hey aetaric I figured it out lol silly me I did "grub" not "sudo grub"
2010-03-26T06:56:00.000Z	Purp1e	coby	Dont ask to ask, ask your question
2010-03-26T06:56:00.000Z	aetaric	Purp1e	i would have done the same thing >.< then again i like to be ROOT sometimes
