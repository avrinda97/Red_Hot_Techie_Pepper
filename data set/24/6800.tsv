2005-07-13T10:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	that's the warty kernel - did you change your sources to point at hoary /
2005-07-13T11:00:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	Yes, I certainly did.
2005-07-13T11:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	have you rebooted since the dist-upgrade? what does `uname -r ` return?
2005-07-13T11:01:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	One momemt...
2005-07-13T11:01:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	2.6.8.1-3-powerpc
2005-07-13T11:02:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	And yes, I've rebooted.
2005-07-13T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	very odd if you have hoary - what does ` cat /etc/issue ` say?
2005-07-13T11:03:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	Ubuntu 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog \n \l
2005-07-13T11:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	it will run, but take a while to start
2005-07-13T11:15:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	It's running...
2005-07-13T11:16:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	Firefox isn't running yet, I guess it's starting...
2005-07-13T11:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	It runs on my pentium 200mmx, 64MB RAM - but it takes a long while to start
2005-07-13T11:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	a quick graphical browser is "dillo" - but it doesn't do javascript, frames etc
2005-07-13T11:19:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	Firefox is just now *barely* getting started...
2005-07-13T11:19:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	I've never heard of dillo; think I'll try it.
2005-07-13T11:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	dillo is quite nice, but somewhat limited - good for searching on google, locl files, simple web pages etc
2005-07-13T11:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	it *is* fast though
2005-07-13T11:22:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	Oh yeah, I've gotta try it.  There's *no way* I'm going to be using Gnome on this old Mac.
2005-07-13T11:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	use xfce4 or something really light like icewm or one of the *box window managers
2005-07-13T11:23:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	How do I find out what to install/remove?
2005-07-13T11:24:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	I understand I'm going to need fluxbox or something?
2005-07-13T11:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	xfce4 would probably run OK - or fluxbox, yes
2005-07-13T11:33:00.000Z	Harold_installin	thoreauputic	was that you?
2005-07-13T11:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Harold_installin	briefly a while ago, yeah
