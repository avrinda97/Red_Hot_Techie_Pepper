2004-12-19T16:32:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	I hope I'm not repeating anything, but there's a decent write-up on Multimedia in Ubuntu in the forums: http://tinyurl.com/6a22q
2004-12-19T16:33:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	(that write-up includes directions to get DVD's playing)
2004-12-21T11:08:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	what's it doing?
2004-12-21T11:08:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	any error messages?
2004-12-21T11:09:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	I doubt that's your only option, though other options might be a bit involved.
2004-12-21T11:10:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	so worst case, you can get your data from your Ubuntu install using one of your other distros...
2004-12-21T11:10:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	...then copy your settings, too.  :)
2004-12-21T11:24:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	couldja perhaps copy xorg.conf or XF86Config from one of your other distros, and start with that?
2004-12-21T11:24:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	mebbe.  :)  make a backup of anything you're changing...
2004-12-21T11:25:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	i'd at least do a visual difference comparison before trying it out.
2004-12-21T11:26:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	/etc/X11/
2004-12-21T11:27:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	yeah.
2004-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	you should be able to get to it if you're comfortable with the 'mount' command.
2004-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	moquist	RuffianSoldier	oh.  you don't have write access, then?
