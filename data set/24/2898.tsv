2008-07-06T22:18:00.000Z	WebcamWonder		Ok guys I have a problem, Ubuntu refuses to boot into .19 kernel and even the dpkg reconfigure with .19 doesn't show up in the list during boot
2008-07-06T22:19:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	maybe the install did not finished ? Tried to apt-get -f install ?
2008-07-06T22:20:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	It was working before, but as I was messing to get my usplash settings correct, now it doesn't :(
2008-07-06T22:21:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	so, (again) have you tried to apt-get -f install ?
2008-07-06T22:23:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	sudo apt-get -f install :: thats i?
2008-07-06T22:23:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	yep, if a package has not finished installing, that will finish the install. (making sure all packages are configured)
2008-07-06T22:24:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	Will try, but it was installed since it was pushed into the repos
2008-07-06T22:24:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	-f install will make sure it's not half-installed
2008-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2008-07-06T22:26:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	you may try to reinstall the kernel. May be something like sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.24-19-generic
2008-07-06T22:27:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	that way, if it cannot be reinstalled because of something you've done with usplash, you should get an error message you can start working with (or tell us)
2008-07-06T22:29:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	Pastebin?
2008-07-06T22:29:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	yep
2008-07-06T22:30:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	kyncani	From my understanding, it worked: http://paste.ubuntu.com/25475/
2008-07-06T22:31:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	Yep, looks all right. Rebooting into 2.6.24.19 should work

2008-07-06T22:37:00.000Z	kyncani	WebcamWonder	that does not sound right according to the pastebin logs you gave, you should take a look at the /boot/grub/menu.lst that update-grub updated. Maybe pastebin it
