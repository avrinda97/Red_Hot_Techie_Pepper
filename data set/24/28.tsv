2012-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	NongA_TongE		Greetings, Anyone willing to help out with ubuntu 12.10 installer issues?
2012-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Tell us what the problem is.
2012-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Couple of things, have you checked the md5sum of the ISO or disc?
2012-10-26T06:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Boot the install using nomodeset, hit f6 at the choice of try or install gui at startup, choose nomodeset and boot in and try the install again. Make sure you tick the download updates in the install gui.
2012-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	- already did that.  a couple of times.  it doesn't seem to make a difference if I have nomodeset on or not.
2012-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Ah, well you could do a net install from the mini cd, it is a text install, or you might try adding the drivers from this PPA, I'm not sure if this requires a logout or reboot which makes it moot. http://www.howopensource.com/2012/10/install-nvidia-geforce-driver-in-ubuntu-12-10-12-04-using-ppa/
2012-10-26T06:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Actually that ppa is not covering 12.10 as of now.
2012-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	- how do I check md5sum of the disk or ISO?
2012-10-26T06:10:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	First link is the easiest to follow.
2012-10-26T06:15:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	- the md5sum of the ISO is perfect.
2012-10-26T06:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Cool, I would try the net install if it was me, if I thought I could get the graphic loaded after install. You might also try a usb, personally I would go with what gets it installed.
2012-10-26T06:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	The live cd runs you could load the usb from there and download the mini.
2012-10-26T06:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	You can't at the least run nomodeset and get the desktop to show?
2012-10-26T06:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	we are not trying the install just downloading a tiny iso and loading the usb.

2012-10-26T06:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Did you boot the cd with the f6 nomodeset option?
2012-10-26T06:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Download however you can and use a usb loader like unetbootin.
2012-10-26T06:39:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	- installing unetbootin right now.
2012-10-26T06:46:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	...OK.  I have mini.iso loaded on a usb drive
2012-10-26T06:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Cool boot it and since it is a net install, make sure you have it plugged in with the etho cord, and install the text gui's are easy to follow, you will have a chance to load the desktop you want.
2012-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	- it boots to a prompt.  "boot:"
2012-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	 -  starts loading, then does the same thing... blacks out says it can't display this video mode.
2012-10-26T06:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	NongA_TongE	Not sure what to say, this has gone beyond my help.
2012-10-26T07:03:00.000Z	NongA_TongE	wilee-nilee	-  thanks for all your assistance.
