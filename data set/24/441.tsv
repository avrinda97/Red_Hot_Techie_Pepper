2012-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	you ever heard of the "login" command in ftp before?
2012-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	yes
2012-11-10T23:31:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	so - if one can use the login command - how is it, that the error message hikenboot sees is server related?
2012-11-10T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	"bind address in use" is a server error, stating it can't bind the daemon to the  interface/address as it's already in use
2012-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	but it's not possible that the client is already connected and that another connection attempt fails because it is already connected?
2012-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	you wouldn't get that error, as you can have multiple ftp client sessions open
2012-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	yeah but not with the same client
2012-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	the client doesn't bind to an address
2012-11-10T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	yes, you can
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	the client connects, tries to authenticate, that fails, but the control connection on tcp/21 is still open
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	yes, that "session" is unique
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	so issuing another open command returns this error
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	if hikenboot would have used login instead, it would have worked
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	did I miss the part where he's opened a second connection ?
2012-11-10T23:33:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	you did
2012-11-10T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	I saw him trying to login, fail, then get the bind error
2012-11-10T23:34:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	i don't need to explain that to you again, do i?
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	errr, I'm only seeing him open one connection from his description, where is he saying he's opening a second connection (I may have missed that in the scroll)
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	it's in the same sentence
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	go read, and think
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	and all other answers are in here: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	I understand how ftp works, I'm not understanding/missing a part of his question
2012-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	grimeton	ikonia	and do me a favour - drop that attitude when trying to give support in this channel - the people in here are not dumb, they just don't know what they should read
2012-11-10T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	grimeton	asking a question about the problem and stating it doesn't make sense it a reasonable question,
