2007-10-03T08:30:00.000Z	scguy318	ajisin	use whatever text editor suits you
2007-10-03T08:35:00.000Z	scguy318	ajisin	sudo apt-get install gproftpd
2007-10-03T08:50:00.000Z	scguy318	ajisin	sudo dpkg --configure -a
2007-10-03T08:52:00.000Z	ajisin	scguy318	now a window inside terminal got open  written <ok> in bottom of it but when i press enter nothing happening
2007-10-03T08:52:00.000Z	scguy318	ajisin	well, i presume its the settings configuration window?
2007-10-03T08:53:00.000Z	ajisin	scguy318	this is it's heading (ProFTPd configuration )
2007-10-03T08:53:00.000Z	scguy318	ajisin	then give the settings you want, tab to tab around, up/down, right?
