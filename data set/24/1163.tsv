2011-07-17T08:18:00.000Z	flametai1		Can anyone help me? I'm running Ubuntu 10.10, never had this problem up until now. Anyways my keyboard likes to randomly just start pressing the i key over and over and over........ Until I press another key then it stops and then does it after awhile in a bit. I have no clue what's causing it. My previous wireless keyboard I bought started only typing i if I pressed the FN key, and no other key would work. Thinking it was the key

2011-07-17T08:18:00.000Z	flametai1		Kind of pissing me off and disliking Ubuntu =/
2011-07-17T08:18:00.000Z	bazhang	flametai1	sounds like you need to clean the keyboard
2011-07-17T08:19:00.000Z	flametai1	bazhang	the keyboards about only 3 months old.
2011-07-17T08:25:00.000Z	bazhang	flametai1	try another keyboard, and try another user, eliminate HW as an issue
2011-07-17T08:26:00.000Z	flametai1	bazhang	I have tried another keyboard and tried as root =/ So I'm pretty sure it has to do with Ubuntu? Unless my keyboard does need a cleaning but I don't think it would only after 3 months?
