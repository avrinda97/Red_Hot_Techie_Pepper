2008-07-26T22:32:00.000Z	Miranda		okay I was here a couple of hours ago and I am wondering if a 5GB HD is sufficient memory to install ubuntu
2008-07-26T22:33:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	yes, but you won't have enuff space for more software
2008-07-26T22:38:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	okay I did the live CD, but after showing the ubuntu logo screen...it's now showing a blank screen. is that normal?
2008-07-26T22:38:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	blank screen?
2008-07-26T22:39:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	blank black screen
2008-07-26T22:49:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	I did the cntrl. + alt. f1 cmd, and it says "ACPI, no DMI BIOS year" acpi is required to acpi? what does that mean?
2008-07-26T22:50:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	I think you have BIOS issues, try fixing the hour in your BIOS
2008-07-26T22:50:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	what's the command?
2008-07-26T22:51:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	reboot and smash either Del or F1
2008-07-26T22:51:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	okay what's the command?
2008-07-26T22:51:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	lol, just press it at boot-time
2008-07-26T22:53:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	it's still loading...should I just wait?
2008-07-26T22:53:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	no, reboot, and tap F1 or Del keys
2008-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	okay I just change the cloak right?
2008-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	yup, change it to actual time
2008-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	and that's it?
2008-07-26T22:56:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	Maybe
2008-07-26T23:02:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	by installing the live CD is it best to just install ubuntu with changes or without changes to HD, since it is an old computer
2008-07-26T23:02:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	How is it'
2008-07-26T23:02:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	64 RAM, 6.4 GB
2008-07-26T23:03:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	so, make an ext3 partition andi install
2008-07-26T23:03:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	how do I do that?
2008-07-26T23:04:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Miranda	Alt+F2 gparted
2008-07-26T23:04:00.000Z	Miranda	Drk_Guy	this is before or after the install?
