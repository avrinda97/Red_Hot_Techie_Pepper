2006-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		not just today, but for the past few days
2006-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	is their a place where ubuntu mentions server states, project problems etc?
2006-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	 I'm not sure really.
2006-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	kidbuntu
2006-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	kidbuntu: however I can take a look at your sources.list files and modify as necessary
2006-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	kidbuntu: add repos, mirrors etc.
2006-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	I can wait a while, I guess they will add some servers or bandwidth, they can't stay down
2006-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	'Waiting' a while isn't exactly a good idea. just set the updates to download at night and go to sleep
2006-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	I don't suspect they will be upgrading their servers anytime soon
2006-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	they don't really have a choise, or ubuntu will be cripled for most
2006-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	they should modify the sources list when you install ubuntu for your location.
2006-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	crippled? I suppose not, but meh.
2006-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	during installation of ubuntu it asks what country are you in. it accordingly creates a sources.list file for you
2006-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	but sometimes other country mirrors can be so much faster.
2006-08-04T06:45:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	this is my list, I pretty much enabled all of it not knowing beter : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19682
2006-08-04T06:46:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	i'll take a look
2006-08-04T06:46:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	thnx
2006-08-04T06:47:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	I'm from belgium btw, in case you need that for mirrors
2006-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	everything seems fine, you can enable the backport repos if need be, but i guess you should use a mirror for all ubuntu archives
2006-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	just put in a 'be.' before all 'archive's in your sources.list, but live security.ubuntu untouched
2006-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	ok thnx
2006-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	finalbeta	DJAdmiral	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main to deb http://be.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main ?
2006-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	finalbeta	yes
