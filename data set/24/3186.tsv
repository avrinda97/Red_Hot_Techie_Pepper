2008-04-06T08:44:00.000Z	level09		how can I detect the full path to some directory ?
2008-04-06T08:44:00.000Z	level09		pwd ?
2008-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	level09		ok thanks :)
2008-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	level09		great :)
2008-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	level09		i'm actually staring to like linux :D
2008-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	level09		that's what I want, I'm installing some complicated crm
2008-04-06T08:47:00.000Z	level09		what does sudo command actually do ?
2008-04-06T08:48:00.000Z	level09		so no need for sudo if i'm a root user
2008-04-06T08:48:00.000Z	level09		why ?
2008-04-06T08:49:00.000Z	jim	level09	that is a long story with some points of charge associated
2008-04-06T08:49:00.000Z	jim		ever run dos?
2008-04-06T08:49:00.000Z	level09		sure, but how is that ? I'm using a secure private key
2008-04-06T08:50:00.000Z	level09		I'm on putty client
2008-04-06T08:50:00.000Z	level09		how to disable root login ?
2008-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	level09		and how do I get back if I disabled it :D
2008-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	jim	level09	one thing, if you're not too familiar with the reasons for that, conventional wisdom suggests it's a bad idea...
2008-04-06T08:52:00.000Z	jim	level09	also not good idea
2008-04-06T08:52:00.000Z	level09	jim	what ?
2008-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	jim	level09	it's not a good idea to disable the root acct, you'll need it to fix things (for one)
2008-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	level09		okay I'm convinced :D , what steps should I do now ?
2008-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	level09		just switch to normal user ?
2008-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	jim	level09	let me just ask this before we get further... do you have stuff you want to keep on the machine you're being root on?
2008-04-06T08:53:00.000Z	level09		I used a normal user , but I kept getting permission denied errors
2008-04-06T08:54:00.000Z	level09	jim	i dont know, I'm running a lamp server
