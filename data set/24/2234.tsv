2009-03-03T00:25:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	well flash drives I dont wanna use with much write activity.. then my external HDD on the other hand :D
2009-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	what games FPS do you have in mind? Quake Wars, Enemy territory, Wolfenstien, Doom, run on Linux
2009-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	not those 10 year old games :D
2009-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	Quake wars came out last year
2009-03-03T00:29:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	yeh I heard. what about GTA4? WOW? all my adventure games?
2009-03-03T00:30:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	sorry not my genre thought you were a FPS guy. I don't do the adventure games, WOW works i know that but. GTA4 brb
2009-03-03T00:33:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	I can't find anything on GTA4 but all the other GTAs work
2009-03-03T00:34:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	Left 4 dead, Spore, Command and conquer: red alert 3, Call of duty: Modern warefare, Halo Zero, unreal Tournament, Bioshock, All work
2009-03-03T00:35:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	it all depends on what you want to play
2009-03-03T00:36:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	yeh. SCUMMVM also runs many adventure games. with a bit more users software devs will nativly support linux
2009-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	yeah thats the problem its the software and hardware devs. Linux isn't the issue, but people look like its linux's issue
2009-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	im sure they will support linux if enough people willing to buy theyr software and stuff
2009-03-03T00:38:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	not a problem though, just research what you want and know what it can and can not do. Linux is a choice, and thats the whole point. I do take some sacrifices but it beats the alternative. I bot a PS3 for my gaming, so i don't have to worry about that.. but that might not be your case.
2009-03-03T00:39:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	exactly.. I also look at it, if the company doesn't want my money then that is fine, that is their business model. I will give my money to the people who are supporting me
2009-03-03T00:41:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	how new are you to linux?
2009-03-03T00:41:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	    i used live CD on ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10
2009-03-03T00:42:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	seems the 8.10 has removed several things :P
2009-03-03T00:48:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	so you have just used live cds as of yet?
2009-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	I find it annoying just useing liveCDs since they don't keep my information
2009-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	used 7.04 and 7.10
2009-03-03T00:57:00.000Z	jerrymcfarts	LOGANonUBUNTU	if you are into liveCDs you should check out Knoppix and BackTrack
2009-03-03T01:01:00.000Z	LOGANonUBUNTU	jerrymcfarts	you know Dyne"Bolic? thats cool too
