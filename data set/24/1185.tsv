2010-05-26T03:01:00.000Z	TheGag96		Hello?
2010-05-26T03:01:00.000Z	TheGag96		I have a question.
2010-05-26T03:01:00.000Z	TheGag96		I'm trying to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10
2010-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	acerimmer	TheGag96	more info
2010-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	TheGag96		and I got it to work, except when I tried to also triple boot iDeneb (Hackintosh), I had to restore my bootloader, and so it's gone
2010-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	TheGag96		I tried easyBCD, but it won't load
2010-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	TheGag96		I tried uninstalling it,
2010-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	acerimmer	TheGag96	wait one i'll post a tutorial.
2010-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	TheGag96		but It said it couldn't find a certain file.
2010-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	TheGag96		I had used the Wubi installer
2010-05-26T03:04:00.000Z	TheGag96	acerimmer	this isn't too general
2010-05-26T03:04:00.000Z	TheGag96		It's a bit more specific
2010-05-26T03:04:00.000Z	acerimmer	TheGag96	I know.  my tutuorial shows how I did it, but I didn't wubi install.
2010-05-26T03:04:00.000Z	TheGag96		okay.
2010-05-26T03:05:00.000Z	TheGag96		I don't know if I should try formatting the partition or what

2010-05-26T03:06:00.000Z	acerimmer	TheGag96	you're going to have to configure a bootable mbr.  not sure if your present config will work.  As you know osx likes GUID, windows/linux use mbr.
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	TheGag96		I'm not trying to do Mac OS x for now because I've used up my MBR's,
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	TheGag96		so it's really just the Linux that I have to worry about
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	TheGag96		Should I try the iso?
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	acerimmer	TheGag96	single HDD?
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	TheGag96		Yeah
2010-05-26T03:07:00.000Z	TheGag96		Partition'd
2010-05-26T03:10:00.000Z	TheGag96	acerimmer	What can I do here?
