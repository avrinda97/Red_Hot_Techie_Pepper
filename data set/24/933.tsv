2010-10-19T10:47:00.000Z	Oxwivi		How can I use different mode/option/switches for Samba? How can I ensure it runs at start up?
2010-10-19T10:48:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	it should already run at startup if you have the server installed
2010-10-19T10:49:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	I don't have a printer, but that might be related to cups?
2010-10-19T10:50:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	We can think about printers later, do you know how to change options?
2010-10-19T10:50:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	what options do you want to change
2010-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	Samba's options. It's -F by default, I want it -D.
2010-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	I meant the opposite.
2010-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	Default is -D, I want it -F.
2010-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	ok which version are you on, as samba changed recently
2010-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	10.10, to run Samba, the command is smbd. I found the options with man smbd.
2010-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	yes, they removed the init script, it uses service now
2010-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	kill any samba you currently have running
2010-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	killall?
2010-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	Operation not permitted, use sudo?
2010-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	yes
2010-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	so you've been starting samba manually?
2010-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	No output, I guess it was succesfull.
2010-10-19T10:56:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	Yes, through the Terminal.
2010-10-19T10:56:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	right I have an idea what it might be thenn, as recently samba in ubuntu went from being an init script to an upstart one
2010-10-19T10:56:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	do this, sudo service smbd start
2010-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	Oops, no I didn't start it manually, but I can't get the printer on network without running the GUI.
2010-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	The Ubuntu system shows up on Windows, but when I run GUI the printer appears.
2010-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	Khedron	Oxwivi	you've lost me, what GUI? your desktop?
2010-10-19T10:58:00.000Z	Oxwivi	Khedron	GUI of system-config-samba, and to make matters worse I'm gonna be sharing the printer with Windows XP, Vista AND 7!
