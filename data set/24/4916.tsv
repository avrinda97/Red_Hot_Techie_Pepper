2006-12-28T14:16:00.000Z	alexis_		Is there any way to get Nautilus show more information about files when hovering the mouse over them?
2006-12-28T14:17:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	Yes, in the view menu.
2006-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	did you mean the statusbar?
2006-12-28T14:21:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	no
2006-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	yes
2006-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	I'm looking there
2006-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	what is it?
2006-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	sorry for being curt, I was typing with one hand, hang on and let me fire up nautilus.
2006-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	ok
2006-12-28T14:25:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	I use view-as lists, do you need more info than that displays?
2006-12-28T14:26:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	It's enough for me, but how can I get it to display the size in kb:s and not in how many folders it contains?
2006-12-28T14:27:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	try view-visible columns.
2006-12-28T14:28:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	I have size and some other stuff enabled, which one should I enable?
2006-12-28T14:28:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	it is up to you.
2006-12-28T14:30:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	I have size enabled, but it doesn't tell me how big folders are in kb:s, it just tells how many folders it contains. It's just folders
2006-12-28T14:30:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	I mean i get information for all other files
2006-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	I see what your saying, I don't know how to do that.
2006-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	in console?
2006-12-28T14:32:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	maybe?
2006-12-28T14:33:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	in the console use du
2006-12-28T14:33:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	It displays the list of files. I can now see everything I need for all other files than folders. For folders the size displayed is how many folders it contains...
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	I'm not familiar with the command, try 'man du'
2006-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	alexis_	n2diy	thanks for your help
2006-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	n2diy	alexis_	nada
