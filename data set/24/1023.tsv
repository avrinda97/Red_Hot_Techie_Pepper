2010-11-20T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	this  channel is ubuntu support, we can help you with ubuntu, but try to keep calm and just state your problem clearly
2010-11-20T17:54:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	has this ever worked
2010-11-20T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	where did you get macbuntu  ?
2010-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	replicasex	ikonia	soruceforce, it's a very popular transformation pack
2010-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	ok - so as a high level summary, you had a working ubuntu cssm, downloading an external package, now the cssm package doesn't work, yes/no ?
2010-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	ok, so if you contact the support team from the soruceforge project page, then can explain what it changes and how, they will know how to undo it
2010-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	replicasex	ikonia	already done.
2010-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	ask the macbuntu support team what it changes, then we can work out how to revery
2010-11-20T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	ok, so have they responded yet
2010-11-20T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	no
2010-11-20T18:05:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	have the macbuntu support team responded ?
2010-11-20T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	re-install then if you can't wait
2010-11-20T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	I have told you how to install rar
2010-11-20T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	sorry - not you
2010-11-20T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	it seems crazy that you would install a software package from an unknown source, not-knowing how it works then complain that it changes things
2010-11-20T18:07:00.000Z	replicasex	ikonia	it wasn't unknown I've installed and uninstalled the package a number of times.
2010-11-20T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	then you should know what it changes and how to fix it
2010-11-20T18:08:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	good look with the re-install, or support fom the macbuntu guys, I suggest we leave it there
2010-11-20T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	It's not an attack, we just don't support that package, so I suggest you contact/wait for response from the macbuntu guys, or re-install
2010-11-20T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	please stop asking about it, we won't suppot the changes that package has made
2010-11-20T18:24:00.000Z	replicasex	ikonia	it's fortunate that ubuntu is so easy to reinstall.
2010-11-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	replicasex	I dont care, install it or don't
