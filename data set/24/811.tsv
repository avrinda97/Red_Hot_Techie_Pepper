2011-01-17T21:22:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 alt + ctl + t on most ditros
2011-01-17T21:22:00.000Z	tiany		i know it, but it always open a new terminal
2011-01-17T21:23:00.000Z	tiany		but i want to open a new tab if there is a terminal is oppened...
2011-01-17T21:23:00.000Z	tiany		oh, I see
2011-01-17T21:25:00.000Z	tiany		ctrl + alt + t always open a new terminal....:(
2011-01-17T21:25:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 ctl + t opens a tab
2011-01-17T21:26:00.000Z	tiany		ctrl + shift + t can open a tab, but you must switch to the terminal first, but if i am not working in the terminal?
2011-01-17T21:26:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 ctl + shft + t opens a tab sorry
2011-01-17T21:27:00.000Z	tiany		i know, but if we are not working in the terminal, how to do it?
2011-01-17T21:28:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 why would you want to open a tab that ur not going to use
2011-01-17T21:30:00.000Z	tiany		I am not meaning that, think this, you firt open a terminal, do something, and then you min the terminal , and do other things, after a minute, you wan to open a new terminal, i don't want to switch to the openned terminal then ctrl + shift + t, I hope there is an shortcut to switch to the openned terminal and open a new tab
2011-01-17T21:32:00.000Z	tiany		just like ff woks
2011-01-17T21:32:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 i think i see  some kind of focus on open tab and auto open tab thing !
2011-01-17T21:33:00.000Z	tiany	dodgy_script	er, how ?
2011-01-17T21:36:00.000Z	dodgy_script	tiany	 on my system i alt tab back to the terminal i opened brings up the blinking cursor the i could ctl + shift + t with out touching mouse
2011-01-17T21:37:00.000Z	tiany		if you open many windows, then alt+tab will be tired
2011-01-17T21:37:00.000Z	tiany		isn't it?
