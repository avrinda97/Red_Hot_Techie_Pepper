2009-12-31T22:40:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	did the rest of your output indicate a chipset?
2009-12-31T22:41:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	no, it did not
2009-12-31T22:41:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	maybe wlan and lan do belong to the same chipset, and only the wlan part is disabled
2009-12-31T22:42:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	pastebin output?
2009-12-31T22:42:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	i don't have an internet connection with the computer right now
2009-12-31T22:43:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	what is the device mnfctr?
2009-12-31T22:44:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	the vendor of the Ethernet interface is via
2009-12-31T22:46:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	your output should have: description: Network controller #and:    product:   #what is detailed here?
2009-12-31T22:54:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	you are trying to set up wired or wifi?  is this a new install?
2009-12-31T22:57:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	it is a new install and i am going to install wifi, wired is working (except that i don't have a wire right now)
2009-12-31T22:58:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	this will be easiest if you do this while wired .. fyi
2009-12-31T22:59:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	the ethernet is your wired, not the wifi.  so if not wire, it will show network disconnected
2009-12-31T23:00:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	so presumably there is no wifi driver found at all
2009-12-31T23:00:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	try lspci -v
2009-12-31T23:00:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	goto the bottom of the output to find the section 'network controller'
2009-12-31T23:01:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	did you try enabling the hardware driver in the menu?
2009-12-31T23:01:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	which menu?
2009-12-31T23:02:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	goto System/Admin/hardware drivers
2009-12-31T23:02:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	lspci did not list anything which looks like wifi
2009-12-31T23:05:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	i only find proprietary drivers for nvidia and modem
2009-12-31T23:06:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	would i see more drivers if i were contected to the internet?
2009-12-31T23:07:00.000Z	sal_	PrototypeX29A	not necessarily.  what is your wifi hardware?
2009-12-31T23:08:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	i don't know. I will try it later again, when i have internet
2009-12-31T23:08:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	sal_	thanks for your help
