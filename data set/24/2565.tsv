2008-11-07T00:39:00.000Z	Kengine		paul68:its 11b/g Wireless Lan (its Atheros)
2008-11-07T00:39:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	do you see the wireless driver in the restricted drivers list?
2008-11-07T00:40:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	Currently I am in vista, but the Driver version is 7.6.0.96
2008-11-07T00:40:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	I can only help you when you under linux
2008-11-07T00:41:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	do you think 8.10 would detect it if I do a full installation ? I mean in live it didnt support it
2008-11-07T00:41:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	I understand, I need to go back home and use the livecd again to get into Ubuntu
2008-11-07T00:41:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	well it might but can you see the driver in the restricted drivers list

2008-11-07T00:42:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	where is the restricted driver list ? how do I get to that ?
2008-11-07T00:43:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	system > administration > hardware drivers
2008-11-07T00:45:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	so I try to find under that if there is an aetheros driver ?
2008-11-07T00:45:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	yes
2008-11-07T00:46:00.000Z	Kengine	paul68	if Aetheros is there, then what do I do ? (sorry for asking but I cant connect to internet when I am inside there)
2008-11-07T00:47:00.000Z	paul68	Kengine	if the driver is there then you know that its supported in 8.10 then you can enable it and use your wifi if that doesn
