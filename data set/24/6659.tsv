2005-09-01T07:07:00.000Z	dooglus		ha.  after re-downloading Java, reinstalling in several times, trying everything I could think of... you know what fixed it in the end?  A REBOOT!  What is this I'm running, Windows???
2005-09-01T07:08:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	what problem are you having?
2005-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	firefox was hanging whenever I visited a page with a java applet on it, and azureus was hanging when I tried to start it.  This is on breezy.  I fixed it by reinstalling the JVM from Sun and rebooting.
2005-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	hmm that's odd.. 5.04 release.. I used the jre and it worked after I did exactly what the sun website mentioned.. well similar but yeah it worked
2005-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	did you use a script to configure iptables or did you do it by hand?
2005-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	I use ipkungfu
2006-02-20T15:49:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	ubuntu-desktop depends on gnome-nettool, which depends on whois
2006-02-20T15:50:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	ahh ok, well my bad
2006-02-20T16:05:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	kubuntu and ubuntu co-exist.  you don't install one on top of the other.
2006-02-20T16:05:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	I'm trying to install KDE for ubuntu (which only has Gnome)
2006-02-20T16:07:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	any clue?
2006-02-20T16:13:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	what's the question?  have I tried it?  yes, I have.  did it work?  yes, it did.
2006-02-20T16:13:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	maybe "how?" : "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"
2006-02-20T16:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	I have both ubuntu and kubuntu (Hoary) on cd. I have installed ubuntu via the hoary cd, but I want apt-get to install kubuntu-desktop via kubuntu cdrom that I have. So far I have got apt-get to read the cd but it said there are unmet dependencies. Each of the packages claim that they are not to be installed
2006-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	I guess you've updated your ubuntu installation so that it now depends on newer packages than you have on CD?
2006-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	yeah, would it cause an impact?
2006-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	add the net sources as well as the CD sources.  it will use the CD where it can, and download what it needs to
2006-02-20T16:17:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	you can investigate further - try installing one of the packages it says won't be installed.  it'll tell you why it won't be installed
2006-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	currently I have the cd as the first ones on the list, and its followed by the net ones. The last thing I want is apt-get asking to download 200MB worth of KDE files like it did last time, if that's the case, I'll probably have to wipe the hd clean and start fresh again
2006-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	kubuntu sucks in Hoary anyway...
2006-02-20T16:19:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	well, as of that time, I had both those cd
2006-02-20T16:19:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	hoary is almost a year old now - it's worth updating to breezy anyway.
2006-02-20T16:20:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	dooglus	I did dist-upgrade to breezy awhile ago on Kubuntu, and that caused failsafe to not work on x
2006-02-20T17:10:00.000Z	dooglus	hatake_kakashi	there was a big security problem with KDE recently wasn't there - could it just be that your CD has vulnerable packages on it, and that's why the install is wanting to download new, fixed packages instead?
