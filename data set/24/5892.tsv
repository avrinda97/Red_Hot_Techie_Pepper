2006-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	but if you have the need to, treat it like a hard-drive partition
2006-03-31T15:13:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	ok i have a cdrw and dvdrw. when i put a cd music/data cd in the cdrw it doesn't automount like it use to before i switchted to xfce. my mounting point is /media/cdrom0 it's /dev/hdb. i just want to automount, i remember doing something like mount -(?)
2006-03-31T15:14:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	pmount /dev/hdb
2006-03-31T15:16:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	is this normal? walter@ubuntu:~$ pmount /dev/hdb
2006-03-31T15:16:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	yes I think so
2006-03-31T15:17:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	shouldn't i be able to write to it, especially since it's a rw?
2006-03-31T15:17:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	for writing, you'd need it unmounted, and use a burning tool
2006-03-31T15:18:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	oh to read i need to mount it and to write to it i need to unmount then burn?
2006-03-31T15:18:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	nautilus includes a burning tool with Go -> CD creator
2006-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	ok next ?, i have a dvdrw, same thing? pmount?
2006-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	sorry I'm not completely familiar with a CDRW setup
2006-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	what did the pmount do?
2006-03-31T15:20:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	pmount mounts the device as /media/xxx where xxx should correspond to the device type
2006-03-31T15:22:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	ok good, my cdrom is /dev/hdb mounting access /media/cdrom0 but my dvd show /dev/hdb with cdrom1, is it safe for the dvd to be name cdrom1? shouldn't be dvd0 or something?
2006-03-31T15:24:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	I'm not sure - you can pmount /dev/hdb dvd if you want
2006-03-31T15:24:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	both devices aren't really /dev/hdb are they?
2006-03-31T15:24:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	sorry dvd is hdd
2006-03-31T15:27:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	/dev/hdd dvd..........what does the dvd (at the end) do just name it on my desktop?
2006-03-31T15:28:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	yes, it's just a label for the /media mountpoint - use it if you don't like the automatic label naming
2006-03-31T15:28:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	 thanks
2006-03-31T15:30:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	 shouldn't they say auto instead? /dev/hdb        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
2006-03-31T15:32:00.000Z	stansell	wd3	the udf,...noauto stuff is put in by pmount for you
2006-03-31T15:33:00.000Z	wd3	stansell	thanks edit won't edit fstab how do i?
