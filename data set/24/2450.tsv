2009-03-24T20:37:00.000Z	chyea		hi all. if i've got a few domains, dns hosted by godaddy, and they're pointing to my server (i'm going to attempt to setup a mail server), is there anything i should do to let my server know they're pointing to it?
2009-03-24T20:37:00.000Z	chyea		i keep reading, and hearing about hosts, and stuff.
2009-03-24T20:37:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	well you have to confugre your mailserver
2009-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	i was messing with postfix, but i think it's a little too advanced for me. i'm currently setting up qmail.
2009-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	I use postfix, IMHO it's easier to setup and there are lots of docs about it
2009-03-24T20:41:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	yea, ubuntu has the package for it, too. i don't know. i had it running, i guess. my problems came from dovecot, i think. i wasn't able to receive mail from other MTAs.
2009-03-24T20:42:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	what is your domain name?
2009-03-24T20:43:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	its down now
2009-03-24T20:45:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	should my MX record point to an A record... or just the actual mail server IP?
2009-03-24T20:45:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	the mx should point to your mail servers name
2009-03-24T20:46:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	godaddy is doing my dns for me, so it's going to have to either be my server's IP, or an A record which points to that IP.
2009-03-24T20:46:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	I hate godaddy's dns system. I dont use it
2009-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	it's not down. i'm able to nslookup on it and it works.
2009-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	did you look at your mailserver logs
2009-03-24T20:48:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	port 25 is (mailserver)
2009-03-24T20:50:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	yea, I have to do about 10 different relays though 5 different servers
2009-03-24T20:51:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	i don't really know a whole lot about this whole process - i'm doing this mainly for learning purposes. i don't think i'll be needing to relay to a different MTA - i'd like to just send straight to the internet if that's how it works.
2009-03-24T20:52:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	yea pretty much
2009-03-24T20:52:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	is this off your home connection? can you get a proper rdns setup?
2009-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	it's off my VPS
2009-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	okies that works.
2009-03-24T20:54:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	ok, cool. give me a few minutes to grab postfix again.
2009-03-24T20:56:00.000Z	squidly	chyea	/msg me with the link please
2009-03-24T21:06:00.000Z	chyea	squidly	i PM'd you. going to go grab a soda, though, brb.
