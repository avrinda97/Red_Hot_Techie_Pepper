2007-12-30T20:36:00.000Z	fwar	ompaul	hi again i still with the problem what to do now ?
2007-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	when you go to log in there is a sessions option on the screen choose gnome in that
2007-12-30T20:44:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	you have been told how to switch sessions
2007-12-30T20:44:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	when you go to log in there is a sessions option on the screen choose gnome in that
2007-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	you have to make it your "default"
2007-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	or you have broken your system
2007-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	and the command I gave you should fix gnome
2007-12-30T20:46:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	did it ever work?
2007-12-30T20:49:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-12-30T20:51:00.000Z	fwar	ompaul	ok now i think i have to log out ?
2007-12-30T20:51:00.000Z	ompaul	fwar	yes
