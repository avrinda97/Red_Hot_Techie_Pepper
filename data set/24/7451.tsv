2005-01-13T17:39:00.000Z	neighborlee		also is there a 'easy' way to install it ? :(
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingJavaSupport/view?searchterm=java < easier than this crap I mean
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		nope can't be
2005-01-13T17:40:00.000Z	neighborlee		other distros have it preinstalled

2005-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	neighborlee		suse does..mepis does
2005-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	other distros have some of the free sdk's installed.
2005-01-13T17:41:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	i would check and be sure that mepis has sun's.
2005-01-13T17:42:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	at what cost is making it easy worth
2005-01-13T17:43:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	what do you mean by fail ?
2005-01-13T17:44:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	i don't think that is what linux is about.  linux is not here trying to takeover winblows.
2005-01-13T17:44:00.000Z	neighborlee	scoon	I never said it was ;-)
2005-01-13T17:44:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	> it will fail to share the market share with that stupid M$
2005-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	but it is sharing. look around here tonite, any one of these people could just as easily be running winhell and mirc
2005-01-13T17:46:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	and god bless the registry, best thing about breaking winblows.
2005-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	linux IS succeeding !!!!!!!!!

2005-01-13T17:56:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	how hard is it for you to get the java plugin from SUN and copy it into $HOME/.mozilla/plugins ?
2005-01-13T17:57:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	I am assuming that is all you want.
2005-01-13T17:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	scoon	not what im referring to
2005-01-13T17:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	scoon	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingJavaSupport/view?searchterm=java < is what im referring to
2005-01-13T17:58:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	that is for installing the SDK ? is that what you want ?
2005-01-13T17:58:00.000Z	scoon	neighborlee	are you developing w/ java.  commercially ?
