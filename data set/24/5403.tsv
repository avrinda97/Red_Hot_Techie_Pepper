2010-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	thetem		i am trying a new installation process of a dual boot system
2010-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	thetem		i want to install Ubuntu first
2010-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	uhmm
2010-08-26T08:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	better to install Windows first
2010-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	otherwise it will go over the Grub bootloader, when you put Windows on, and re installing the bootloader isn't that  easy
2010-08-26T08:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	anyway jrib is a sort of expert,  and there will be some others around
2010-08-26T08:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	if you hack it you can use the Windows bootloader
2010-08-26T08:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	or if you use Wubi, which I woudn't normally recommend
2010-08-26T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	indeed @ jrib
2010-08-26T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	the chance of Grub 2 messing up afer you have installed Ubuntu, is not that likely at all
2010-08-26T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	unless you do something silly like putting Windows on after Ubuntu of course
2010-08-26T08:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	you want to use the Windows bootloader to boot Ubuntu, well that is not so easy to do, and not standard
2010-08-26T08:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	oh you want to boot Solaris?
2010-08-26T08:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	in IT?
2010-08-26T08:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	depends
2010-08-26T08:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thetem	Ubuntu is okish,  Mint can be ok,  and there are other distros that are quite user friendly as well and so on.  http://www.distrowatch.com
