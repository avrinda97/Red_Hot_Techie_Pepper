2007-01-08T08:44:00.000Z	magic_ninja		how do i get my nvidia driver version
2007-01-08T08:46:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	dpkg -l '*nvidia*'
2007-01-08T08:51:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	methinks downgrading packages is a bad idea
2007-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	what about upgrading to beta drvrs i have heard good things about theme
2007-01-08T08:52:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	how about keeping your current version, i've heard you don't have any real problem with them :p
2007-01-08T08:58:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	i get a choppy framerate and nvidia says they have fixed a few bugs for geforce 3 and 4 cards (i have ti200)
2007-01-08T09:00:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	i would either * keep current version * use backports * use feisty (in this order)
2007-01-08T09:01:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	is feisty pretty unstable
2007-01-08T09:02:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	yep
2007-01-08T09:05:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	you could dual boot edgy and feisty, that way you could check if a recent driver would make any difference
2007-01-08T09:21:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	you could dual boot edgy and feisty
2007-01-08T09:22:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	yea but not interested in dual boots, thats why I don't have windows
2007-01-08T09:22:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	you could dual boot edgy and feisty, that way you could check if a recent nvidia driver would make any difference
2007-01-08T09:40:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	you are wrong sir
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	unless you've done a low level format (aka write 000000's to the hdd) its possible to recover data at least partially
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	it's the short version, for newbs
2007-01-08T09:41:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	the utils are usually pretty simple for that sorta thing
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	simple enough for someone who does not keep backup and format rather lightly ??
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	:))
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	actually yes i was helping someone do it earlier to recover a very important business document they were working on
2007-01-08T09:43:00.000Z	magic_ninja	kyncani	he had the money, bought the prog online (it was like 100 bucks) and used it and it worked
2007-01-08T09:46:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	last time i checked (a long time ago), these kind of gpl'ed tools were not real newbs friendly
2007-01-08T09:58:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	Thug-N-Me: methinks testdisk is already packaged for ubuntu
2007-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	kyncani	magic_ninja	mayb modprobe -r and modprobe (in again) some cdrom related modules ?
