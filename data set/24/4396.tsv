2008-08-20T23:09:00.000Z	Brucevdk		SSH question, is it possible to define either the use of public keys or passwords on a per account/user basis?
2008-08-20T23:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	Do you want to limit the key people to key only?
2008-08-20T23:10:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	what do you mean?
2008-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	some people like disallowing password logins when using public keys, did you?
2008-08-20T23:11:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	yes, I've disabled password authentication
2008-08-20T23:13:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	I guess enabling password authentication and then using AllowUsers would be a OK solution? What do you think?
2008-08-20T23:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	only thing I can think of for a mixed environment is to allow both.  The people who don't have keys obviously can't use them.  but then you run into the problem of allowing people with keys to log in with passwords.
2008-08-20T23:14:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	yeah that just crossed my mind too, I only want people designated as "must have keys" to be able to login with keys (not passwords)
2008-08-20T23:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	allowusers is only used for who can access at all, through whatever means.
2008-08-20T23:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	Do the people with keys have admin access?
2008-08-20T23:15:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	not perse
2008-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	Since, if none of them could sudo, theoretically you could lock their accounts (I believe that won't affect the key based auth)
2008-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	"lock their accounts"?
2008-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	passwd -l account
2008-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	Changes the password has to something that could never be generated (by inserting illegal characters)
2008-08-20T23:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	that is, password hash.
2008-08-20T23:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	It might lock them out of key based auth as well, I'm not sure.
2008-08-20T23:18:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	let me try it out for a second, but this still doesn't sound ideal ;-)
2008-08-20T23:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Brucevdk	No, I agree it doesn't.  You might ask in #ubuntu-server, or even try a ssh channel (#ssh? #openssh? they both exist, no idea re: activity in either)
2008-08-20T23:20:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	thanks, I'll try those out ;)
2008-08-20T23:27:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	took me a while but locking an account will result in "Your account has expired; please contact your system administrator" when connecting over SSH
2008-08-20T23:28:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	just thought I'd let you know ;)
2009-04-25T14:43:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	I know, (search up) but he said he saved in ~/.gpg so I thought he might have just saved something wrong
2009-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Flannel	good find, looks like I was close :-)
