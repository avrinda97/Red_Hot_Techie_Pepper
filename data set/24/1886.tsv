2009-07-08T20:31:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4		Hi , I need a bit of help here .The gedit doesn't display
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 can you open it by going to Applications>Accessories>Text Editor?
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	yep
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 and it works fine that way?
2009-07-08T20:33:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	yep , I had similar problem with this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=764024
2009-07-08T20:34:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	typing sudo gedit or even gksudo doesn't work.It doesn't display anything but after 5 min it pop and it crash
2009-07-08T20:35:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	i really need help , I can't edit anything at all
2009-07-08T20:36:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 well for now, you could use "sudo vi /path/to/file" to edit them
2009-07-08T20:36:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 have you tried running "gksu gedit /path/to/file"??
2009-07-08T20:37:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 you're supposed to run 'gksu' instead of 'sudo' when you're running a command that will open a GUI (such as gedit)
2009-07-08T20:38:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	still doesn't work
2009-07-08T20:38:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 gksu didn't work, or using vi didn't work?
2009-07-08T20:38:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	even typing gksu " gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2009-07-08T20:39:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	vi works
2009-07-08T20:40:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list works
2009-07-08T20:41:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	why gedit doesn't work ?
2009-07-08T20:41:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-07-08T20:41:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 I'm not sure. Your best bet for now would be to use an vi or another text editor for the meantime, and see if there's a bug report for your problem
2009-07-08T20:42:00.000Z	swoody	ubuntunewbie4	 if not, then you should make a bug report about it
2009-07-08T20:43:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie4	swoody	, arand , specto : my case is 100% silimar with this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=764024
