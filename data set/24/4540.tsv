2007-03-15T14:46:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	can't you set up a new user in /home and then put the files in there?
2007-03-15T14:46:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	chown and chmod commands
2007-03-15T14:47:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	but research this further before doing anything
2007-03-15T14:48:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	no, you can copy from the command line
2007-03-15T14:48:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	I think you should read about UNIX commands
2007-03-15T14:51:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	are you running a streaming server for music?
2007-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	HollywoodCode	Pollywog	yes i am
2007-03-15T14:52:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	I think you should add a user to the system and put the music in their $HOME
2007-03-15T14:53:00.000Z	HollywoodCode	Pollywog	i already have one user, if i create another user, will i have to logged in as that user on this linux box in order to stream music when im at work?
2007-03-15T14:54:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	I don't think so
2007-03-15T14:55:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	I think there are howtos for that and if you put the music in /var, by your logic you would need to be root to hear the music at work
2007-03-15T14:55:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	you should be able to do what you want to do by adding a new user and streaming as that user
2007-03-15T14:57:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	is a dangerous fellow  ;)
2007-03-15T15:11:00.000Z	Pollywog	HollywoodCode	the command is xmms in small case
