2009-09-08T00:22:00.000Z	khafra		I have Ubuntu 8.04 Live running, and I want to put 9.04 live on another USB device, but I can't get the usb-installer package
2009-09-08T00:22:00.000Z	khafra		sudo apt-get install usb-installer just says it can't find hat
2009-09-08T00:22:00.000Z	khafra		And manually attempting to install syslinux or grub has never worked for me
2009-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Try unetbooin
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Tried it, but it won't boot--says there's some problem with ACPI in my bios and drops to a busybox shell
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Are you using jaunty right now?  Go to System > Admin > USB startup
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Also it's called usb-creator iirc
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Yeah, that's what I was asctually trying to install, sorry
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	khafra		Still Couldn't find package usb-creator
2009-09-08T00:26:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	you using jaunty?
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Hardy
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	it comes along with it
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	usb-creator comes with 8.04?
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Sry I'm wrong, it is only included in the LiveCD
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	sudo apt-get install usb-creator
2009-09-08T00:28:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Make sure the software-sources are activated if you are on a live cd (software sources or sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list). You may need to install the python-gnome2 package as well.
2009-09-08T00:29:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	I can install any other package, including packages from universe and multiverse.  I've already got python-gnome2.  Just can't even find usb-creator.  Wow, That's Funny.
2009-09-08T00:31:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Here:  http://tr.im/y6FP
2009-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Thanks! unfortunately "Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: python-central" even though "python-central is already the newest version"
2009-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	khafra		I think it's safe to say at this point that the universe hates me.
2009-09-08T00:32:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Time to upgrade to Jaunty :D
2009-09-08T00:33:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Exactly what I'm trying to do! Gaaaaah!
2009-09-08T00:33:00.000Z	Loafers	khafra	Install windows then :D
2009-09-08T00:34:00.000Z	khafra	Loafers	Actually, that's not a bad idea.  I have XP running on an old laptop; I could try the Windows LiveUSB installer on that.
