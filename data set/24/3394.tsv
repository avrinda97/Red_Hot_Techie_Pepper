2009-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	MHz128		After upgrading to a larger monitor, my screen resolution is no longer auto detected... I am forced to manually set it bootup... any ideas?
2009-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	MHz128		each bootup
2009-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	what video card?
2009-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	nvidia 7300 le
2009-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	run: gksudo nvidia-settings
2009-01-04T05:36:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	ya, Ive done that... it says it saves to the config file....... but it doesn't work
2009-01-18T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	not sine i apt-built it ;)
2009-01-18T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	but yes the standard is dog slow, try opera if you want fast
2009-01-18T01:52:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	apt-built? explain
2009-01-18T01:53:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	opera is java based?
2009-01-18T01:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	no, its coded in C and C++ (and I think some assembly)
2009-01-18T01:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	its like emerge for gentoo, it uses deb-src and compiles source to make deb files which can make apps run nicer)
2009-01-18T01:55:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	the apps run faster because they were compiled on your own machine?
2009-01-18T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	it can help, give it a try. its a good laugh
2009-01-18T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	sudo apt-get install apt-build; sudo apt-build update; sudo apt-build install firefox-3.0
2009-01-18T01:56:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	have you used Firefox in Windows XP? its much faster than it is in linux.... at least in my installation
2009-01-18T01:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	its all confiog my friend
2009-01-18T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	read some guides, th commands i gave you will give you what you already have but you can set optomisation levels higher to see if its better
2009-01-18T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	personally i think firefox is too fat, swiftfox is much nicer
2009-01-18T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	dont be firefox brainwashed, there are lots of browsers out there
2009-01-18T01:59:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	i've tried epiphany and midori... neither seem to produce 'accurate' looking web pages
2009-01-18T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MHz128	apt-cache search web | grep -i browser
2011-02-04T12:32:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	its from googlecode?? weird
2011-02-04T12:35:00.000Z	MHz128	ActionParsnip	thanks guy!!!
