2005-11-16T17:50:00.000Z	marlun		if for example I want to know which version of python-wxgtk that is installed on my system, how can I check?
2005-11-16T13:20:00.000Z	marlun		Hello again everyone! I'm wondering, Ubuntu has Firefox 1.0.7 installed by default, if I want to upgrade to 1.5 RC2, what should I do, just download it and manually install it or somehow through the Package Manager?
2005-11-16T13:21:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	firefox rc2 is out or rc1?
2005-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	rc2 is out
2005-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	nothing big, just some fixes to the automatic update system (atleast thats what the release notes say)
2005-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	cool, thanks
2005-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	I cannot wait for firefox 1.5 final to go on Ubuntu... its faster...
2005-11-16T13:24:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	np, could you help me out? I've downloaded the firefox-1.5rc2.tar.gz and it automaticly opened it in something called fileroller which seems to be like winrar for windows, should I just copy it over the old firefox folder?
2005-11-16T13:24:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	check Ubuntu forums... walkthrough already there for firefox 1.5
2005-11-16T13:24:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	oh, ok =) thanks
2005-11-16T13:25:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	which of the forums should I search in?
2005-11-16T13:26:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	I believe it is in the Ubuntu howto forums... search for firefox 1.5
2005-11-16T13:26:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	the walkthrough works, I did it and had no problems!
2005-11-16T13:36:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	when, firefox 1.5 is released will I be able to update it through the Synaptic Package Manager then?
2005-11-16T13:37:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	Firefox has it;s own update feature... I currently downgraded and cant wait for it :)
2005-11-16T13:46:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	yeah I know but I looked at the walkthrough and it's not as easy for me as it sounds on the text, for example how to install mozilla-mplayer, I can't find it in the package manager, and also they say I need libstdc++5 but I've got 6, do I still need 5 or is 6 a later version?
2005-11-16T13:47:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	oh, but what about the libstdc++5? :P
2005-11-16T13:48:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	I followed the tute a while ago, it worked perfect and let me test Firefox 1.5 for a bit... then I just downgraded... I can wait and don't wish to break Ubuntu or something :)
2005-11-16T13:49:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	so your waiting untill it's up in the Package Manager?
2005-11-16T13:49:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	sure, its no big deal and doesn't intriduce features which are too die for or anything :)
2005-11-16T13:49:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	yeah thats what I was asking before if it was going to add to their for easy update when 1.5 was released :)
2005-11-16T13:50:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	excuse my horrible english :)
2005-11-16T13:51:00.000Z	vbgunz	marlun	when the official 1.5 is released... if Ubuntu doesn't up to it in time I might go ahead and install otherwise waiting will be no big deal... The one really cool thing about the new Firefox is how popups and javascript windows can be forced into a tab instead which is really nice...
2005-11-16T13:52:00.000Z	marlun	vbgunz	yeah okey then I'll just hope they'll add it when it comes :)
