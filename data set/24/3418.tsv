2010-04-28T00:21:00.000Z	lenswipe		hey guys
2010-04-28T00:21:00.000Z	lenswipe		one of my admins chmodded /etc to 777
2010-04-28T00:21:00.000Z	lenswipe		how do i fix it?
2010-04-28T00:21:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	first, fire him.
2010-04-28T00:21:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	second, chmod it back to 755.
2010-04-28T00:22:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	recursive?
2010-04-28T00:22:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	did he chmod it to 777 recursively?
2010-04-28T00:23:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	im not sure
2010-04-28T00:23:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	if he has what do i do
2010-04-28T00:24:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	Check your /var/log/messages to see what sudo logged.  Or, if he didn't use sudo (i.e. he just did a "su" to change his euid), fire him.
2010-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	Frankly, I don't know the permissions of everything in /etc, but at the very least you chould `chmod -R go-w /etc` to make the system safe again.  It may be broken, but at least it'll be safer.
2010-04-28T00:46:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	whats the default for /etc again is it 755?
2010-04-28T00:47:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	yes
2010-04-28T00:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	ive looked through users .bash_history files and that other one you told me to check - i cant see who did that stunt with /etc
2010-04-28T00:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	/var/log/messages was just a heap of numbers
2010-04-28T00:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	any ideas?
2010-04-28T00:49:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	from what I've heard so far, my instinct would be to "back-up and reinstall".  Then implement finer-grained security via sudo.
2010-04-28T00:51:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	i had sudo.....i just have a ****tarded admin screwing things up
2010-04-28T00:52:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	but if your /var/log/messages is gibberish, that doesn't sound healthy.  If THAT is busted, who knows what else is.
2010-04-28T00:52:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	its just a column of numbers like 0020030133324
2010-04-28T00:53:00.000Z	ghoti	lenswipe	er...  can you give me an example of 1 line?
2010-04-28T00:53:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	sure
2010-04-28T00:54:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	loads of "Feb 28 12:59:49 trogdor -- MARK --"
2010-04-28T00:55:00.000Z	lenswipe	ghoti	not really informative though
