2005-12-29T09:34:00.000Z	lowman62		what file type would a lexar jumpdrive secure be?
2005-12-29T09:36:00.000Z	lowman62		i been searching all day to this stupid jumpdrive to work...i got it finally mounted but I cannot write to it :(
2005-12-29T09:38:00.000Z	lowman62		is nfsd a filesystem format? :P
2005-12-29T09:38:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	dont' know about nfsd
2005-12-29T09:39:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	so what is the name of the device then?
2005-12-29T09:40:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	have you done a sudo fdisk -l <insert device name here> command?
2005-12-29T09:41:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	if its ntfs then linux can't in a general sense write to ntfs
2005-12-29T09:41:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	certain experimental programs can do it.
2005-12-29T09:42:00.000Z	lowman62	mustard5	i think i messed it up the last time i had mandrake installed...see it used to have a little program built into it and i deleted it off and so i thought maybe if i could mount it i could share it to my windows box and change its format...i am not even sure if you can do that \
2005-12-29T09:44:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	ah ok..my usb stick has something similar...a built in program for locking the device with a password or something
2005-12-29T09:44:00.000Z	lowman62	mustard5	yes thats it...it's a lexar secure jumpdrive 128 meg
2005-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	hmm...have you tried looking for their website to see if they can help with the problem?
2005-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	lowman62	mustard5	yes I did and they had the driver for windows but of course it gets recognized in windows xp but doesn't show up
2005-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	hmm k
2005-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	bit of a tricky problem really
2005-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	lowman62	mustard5	it sure is...i have exhausted myself <--doesn't give up easy on things at all
2005-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	maybe you could try rebooting with the usb stick still in place
2005-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	in windows that is
2005-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	my second 'drive' on the usb stick sometimes shows up as a floppy device
2005-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	that was on windows 98 though
2005-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	lowman62	mustard5	I tried that several times as well as tweaking the registry to see if I could get it to show...I think it is just toasted...and the time spent i could save and just buy another one ...bigger and better LOL
2005-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	probably right :)
2005-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	I can imagine its annoying to have toasted it though :)
2006-01-17T08:28:00.000Z	mustard5	lowman62	I think Katie^ is trying to install some software in wine...
