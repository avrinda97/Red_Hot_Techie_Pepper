2010-03-13T15:25:00.000Z	motaka2		heelo i cant delete some files from my flash memory, saying " chmod: changing permissions of `/media/disk/.Trash-1000.exe': Read-only file system "   when i sudo chmod -R 777 /media/
2010-03-13T15:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	it looks like the device mounted on /media/disk is mounted read only
2010-03-13T15:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	this is a windows fs no?
2010-03-13T15:30:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	llutz that also happends when its a windows fs that has a dirty flag on it and needs to be shutdown cleanly or chkdsk from M$
2010-03-13T15:35:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	only whats  in quotes there =)
2010-03-13T15:37:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	Dr_Willis  no not yet, i cant remove sthem
2010-03-13T15:38:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	llutz  it says "Error removing file: Read-only file system" when i try to delete a dir
2010-03-13T15:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	'sudo mount -o remount,rw,uid=1000 /media/disk'
2010-03-13T15:41:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	llutz  no no no, it doesnt work
2010-03-13T15:43:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	no, it doesnt
2010-03-13T15:44:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	one second
2010-03-13T15:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	'sudo mount -o force /media/disk'
2010-03-13T15:48:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	donkarlo@donkarlo-desktop:~$ sudo mount -o force /media/disk
2010-03-13T15:49:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	right 'sudo umount /media/disk && mount -o force /media/disk'
2010-03-13T15:49:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	correction 'sudo umount /media/disk && sudo mount -o force /media/disk'
2010-03-13T15:51:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	donkarlo@donkarlo-desktop:~$ sudo umount /media/disk && sudo mount -o force /media/disk
2010-03-13T15:53:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	then after you unmount it with 'sudo umount /media/disk' given the device is /dev/sdb1 do.. 'sudo mount -o force /dev/sdb1 /media/disk'
2010-03-13T16:26:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	are you thre?
2010-03-13T16:26:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	yes
2010-03-13T16:26:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	i suggest you look at squid documentation
2010-03-13T16:26:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	my system hanged, i restarted it and ut doesnt work any more
2010-03-13T16:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	you need to look at the logs as to why,, motaka2 you should make a point to always check the logs, and squid certainly has one
2010-03-13T16:28:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	motaka2	is the squid set up to autostart? how do you know it was working in the first place? had you made a request through the proxy or pointed your browser to it and confirmed it would relay requests?
2010-03-13T16:29:00.000Z	motaka2	SolarisBoy	be care full with your suggestions from now on
