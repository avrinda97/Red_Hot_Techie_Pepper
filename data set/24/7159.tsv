2005-04-19T13:37:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	in that regard, Debian and Ubuntu tend to share quite similar attitudes, although we're a bit more flexible than Debian in some ways
2005-04-19T13:38:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Really?  How so?
2005-04-19T13:38:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	Ubuntu is officially not bothered about the GFDL, for instance
2005-04-19T13:39:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	GFDL?
2005-04-19T13:39:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	too long to explain
2005-04-19T13:39:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Gnu Free Distributed License?  O.o
2005-04-19T13:39:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	try google ;)
2005-04-19T13:40:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Doing so now. :)
2005-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Interesting.  I thought Debian was a part of GNU.
2005-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	not for many years
2005-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Wow, I'm out of touch.  :)
2005-04-19T13:50:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Thank you Kamion, I believe you have instantly made several people much happier.  :)
2005-04-19T14:22:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	very controversial
2005-04-19T14:23:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Have they been known to retract their policy when they make bad decisions?  Or will they stick with the advice of their "legal team" do you think?
2005-04-19T14:27:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	mm, not that simple really; decisions can be retracted, but there *are* real problems with the licence so it's complicated
2005-04-19T14:27:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Ah, but it *seems* simple.
2005-04-19T14:28:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	I looked at their short little quips which give me the same gist as do the GNU licenses, except in three lines.
2005-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	I mean it's not that simple as 'retract, or stick with the advice of their "legal team"'
2005-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	Ah, I see.
2005-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	In that there will be those in favor and those opposed to the decision?
2005-04-19T14:30:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	yes, it's controversial within the project; but off-topic here really
2005-04-19T14:32:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	my apologies.  I'll keep quiet about it.  :)
2005-04-19T14:33:00.000Z	Kamion	sataere	it would probably fit better in a Debian channel, that's all. :)
2005-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	sataere	Kamion	well, I just like talking about things with people who I know (or have been acquainted with for more than a few seconds)
