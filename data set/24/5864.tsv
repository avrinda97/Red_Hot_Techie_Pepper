2006-08-16T05:08:00.000Z	niekie		You need to add them to /etc/network/interfaces
2006-08-16T05:08:00.000Z	niekie		Does anybody know how I should get my USB ext3 drive mounted on bootup?
2006-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	niekie		I have a USB HD partitioned with FAT32 and ext3
2006-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	niekie		I want to mount the USB drive on /media/usbext3 on boot.
2006-08-16T05:09:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	somewhere under /media/
2006-08-16T05:10:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	the device will be /dev/sdx (where x could be any number)
2006-08-16T05:10:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	yes, I figured that out :)
2006-08-16T05:11:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	there used to be issues between udev and hotplug on boot, but don't know if that has been smoothed out since they were integrated
2006-08-16T05:11:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	hmm..
2006-08-16T05:11:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	you could try adding mount -a to root's crontab @reboot
2006-08-16T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	but that is a poor hack
2006-08-16T05:12:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	would it give any issues?
2006-08-16T05:12:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	it shouldn't
2006-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	external usb drives have been problematic since udev was introduced
2006-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	=S
2006-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	it actually is an internal HD, but it's on an external casing, with USB.
2006-08-16T05:14:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	same thing, i'm afraid
2006-08-16T05:15:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	I'm not that experienced with cron, how would I add it?
2006-08-16T05:15:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	type "sudo crontab -e -u root"
2006-08-16T05:16:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	then in the editor type "@reboot mount -a"
2006-08-16T05:16:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	allright, thank you very much :)
2006-08-16T05:16:00.000Z	mcphail	niekie	_hopefully_ it will work
2006-08-16T05:25:00.000Z	niekie	mcphail	works, thank you very much!
