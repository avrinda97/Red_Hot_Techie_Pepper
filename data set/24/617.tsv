2011-04-29T06:57:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu		how do we get special effects for unity?
2011-04-29T06:58:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	install ccsm
2011-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	ctrl+alt+f1 >> then login >> type sudo service gdm restart
2011-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	is that going to reboot it?
2011-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	yes, the gdm
2011-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	but if the settings in compiz aren't right, then that won't change them right?
2011-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	maybe
2011-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	seems as though I have lost the windows manager, how can I restart it?
2011-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	do you have auto login on?
2011-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	no,
2011-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	reboot (sudo shutdown now -r) and then log into classic desktop (no effects)
2011-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	reconfigure compiz, logout and log back into unity
2011-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	ok, but I'm not sure what to reconfigure compiz back to, I didn't realize it was going to mess up unity with just two clicks of a mouse
2011-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	what did you change?
2011-04-29T07:14:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	I was going to enable the desktop cube, and then all the warnings popped up mostly off the screen so I couldn't see them.
2011-04-29T07:14:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	so trying to click through them without knowing what they said, I'm not really sure what I did.
2011-04-29T07:15:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	try this in a terminal gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz
2011-04-29T07:15:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	logout and login
2011-04-29T07:17:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	hmm, that didn't seem to fix it, still no windows manager.
2011-04-29T07:18:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	at this point you could of reinstalled natty by now...you might as well do that.
2011-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	are you kidding???  I just about got through setting up my install, I can't believe it was that easy to break unity, they should have a great big warning label on compiz
2011-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	I will go back to the classic desktop before I re-install, that is just absurd.
2011-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	Jon4248	shane4ubuntu	lol
2011-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	Jon4248	someone must have a way of fixing this, I mean, it shouldn't be that easy to break it.
