2009-10-07T16:43:00.000Z	dooglus		hi.  is there some way I can find out how much RAM is in a laptop running ubuntu?
2009-10-07T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	free -m
2009-10-07T16:43:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	that tells me 2986 total.  the laptop was sold as having 4GB.  what could be up?
2009-10-07T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	you running a 32bit OS?
2009-10-07T16:44:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	I'm running ubuntu - I guess it's 32bit
2009-10-07T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	is yuor CPU 64bit?
2009-10-07T16:45:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	it's an Core Duo T6600
2009-10-07T16:45:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	I don't know how to count its bits
2009-10-07T16:46:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	but 4GB is only 2^32 I think, so 32 bits are enough to address it?
2009-10-07T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	makes sense, ive seen some 32bit systems only see 3.2Gb though
2009-10-07T16:46:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	ok
2009-10-07T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	could even use a gentoo minimal CD to save data downloaded
2009-10-07T16:47:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	also, it's running an Intel GMA graphics thingy which apparently uses system memory
2009-10-07T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	sure but not 2Gb right ;)
2009-10-07T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	new install
2009-10-07T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	amd just stamped 64bitness kinda first, but it will work
2009-10-07T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	the intels have some amd stuff in them to help OS writing is what i heard a while back
2009-10-07T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	true as it will work on any modern cpu
2009-10-07T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	works great, theres a flashplugin in the repos as well as an lpha 64bit flash that might help
2009-10-07T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	depends on the task, some gain speed, the apps will use the same amount of ram
2009-10-07T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	i think you should look at what 64bit really means
2009-10-07T16:54:00.000Z	dooglus	ActionParsnip1	I was thinking that since pointers are twice the size the ram usage may go up
2009-10-07T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	audio / video encoding benefits from 64bit
2009-10-07T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	dooglus	no, thy can just use more ram effectively without having to use PAE
