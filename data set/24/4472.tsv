2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	Metal03		I've lost my CD drive!  Can't make it work...  I think it's my 2nd HD that took over, can anyone help?
2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	try `dmesg | egrep "^hd"`
2007-07-09T07:16:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	provided they are IDE drives
2007-07-09T07:16:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	yes they are
2007-07-09T07:17:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	what happened in you situation?
2007-07-09T07:17:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	your*
2007-07-09T07:18:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	My CD drive used to work, but when I booted earlier, it said that I mount 30 times my "windows HD" and I needed to fdisk or something (some kind of scan) and I think it messed up my drives and the way they were mounted!
2007-07-09T07:20:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	fsck shouldn't mess up your partitions like that.. can you get to a working system on that machine, or where does it get stuck at?
2007-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	I'm on that exact machine, and all my drives are working except for the CD!
2007-07-09T07:23:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	When I try to click on my CD it says "unable to mount selected volume" and in details it says " special device /dev/hdc/ does not exist"
2007-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	what happens when you type in "dmesg | egrep 'hdc' " in a terminal?
2007-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	[17179576.528000]      ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
2007-07-09T07:26:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	what does it give if you do `ls -l /dev/hd* `
2007-07-09T07:28:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	trying to put it on pastebin...  but pastebin is giving me a hard time
2007-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	try rafb.net

2007-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	how many IDE hard drives do you have?
2007-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	I have 2 hard drives
2007-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	that shows that you have 2 detected, hda and hdb
2007-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	weird.. no cdrom! ;)
2007-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	It is weird...  kind off the reason I'm here asking for your sweet help!!  hehehe
2007-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	is it detected in bios?
2007-07-09T07:34:00.000Z	troxor	Metal03	that would help, make sure you can still boot from it to be sure it isn't the drive itself
2007-07-09T07:35:00.000Z	Metal03	troxor	I'll check that out...  brb
