2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	Gemmie78		If I'm currently on Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon and choose to upgrade to 8.04 will I receive the new firefox
2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I'm currently using firefox 2 and unable to upgrade it simply in the menu
2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	you'll have the firefox that was in 8.04
2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	you mean upgrading to 9.04
2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	9.04 has 3.0.11
2009-07-17T10:54:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	let me check
2009-07-17T10:56:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	it says version 3 in hardy
2009-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	what version of ubuntu areyou running?
2009-07-17T10:59:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	do you have your home on a seperate parititon?
2009-07-17T11:00:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	seperate home is your safeest bet all yoru settins and files should be stored there.
2009-07-17T11:02:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	if you installed everything from apt or synaptic they will all be upgraded. Unless you used 3rd party repos
2009-07-17T11:02:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	there are ways to install firefox 3 on your version of ubuntu as well.
2009-07-17T11:02:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	I don't think system specs have gone up at all
2009-07-17T11:03:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	if anything you would probably see a performance increase due to a better version of gnome etc...
2009-07-17T11:03:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	but if you back up your home you will have all your data and settings
2009-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	all the settings are in . folders hidden in yoru home.
2009-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	there in there as well.
2009-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	everything
2009-07-17T11:04:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	all those settings are in your users home directories
2009-07-17T11:06:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	everything is in your home.  go to places > home and hit ctrl + h to see all the hidden files
2009-07-17T11:06:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	hit ctrl+h again to hide them.
2009-07-17T11:07:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	or you can open a terminal and ls -la
2009-07-17T11:08:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	thats why I keep a seperate home partition I can switch distributions or anything and keep all my data.
2009-07-17T11:11:00.000Z	histo	Gemmie78	it is in an upgrade. But i have the optiont aht I can reload root and just mount my home so that all my stuff stays even when switching to different distros.  You don't have to worry about that if you are upgrading.
