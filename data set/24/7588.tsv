2006-07-14T11:01:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	what happened after your upgrade?
2006-07-14T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	please try "sudo update-grub"
2006-07-14T11:04:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.15-26.386
2006-07-14T11:05:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	that last one should do the trick
2006-07-14T11:06:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	what was the result?
2006-07-14T11:10:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	ok, next time don't paste please
2006-07-14T11:10:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	was it reinstalled?
2006-07-14T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	you can edit /boot/grub/menu.list by hand
2006-07-14T11:12:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	to add the kernel info that's not being added
2006-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	26 is in there now?  Good, sounds like the dpkg-reconfigure worked
2006-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	please put your menu.lst on pastebin
2006-07-14T11:33:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	can you open it in an editor, and copy/paste it all?
2006-07-14T11:40:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	26 is there now
2006-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	so what's the problem now, then?
2006-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	it's there...look for yourself
2006-07-14T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	was your kubuntu install updated?
2006-07-14T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	well, that's why
2006-07-14T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	same base, different desktop environment
2006-07-14T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	before you add it by hand, please update it, and see if it updates your menu.lst properly this time
2006-07-14T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	you know you can install both without separate root partitions, right?
2006-07-14T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	that info would have been useful earlier ;)
2006-07-14T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	yes
2006-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	no, you and sledmouth did it :)
2006-07-14T12:08:00.000Z	tritium	rredd4	any time, buddy :)
