2010-10-17T02:27:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	basically, it a gui to let u change alot of things in the gnome environment with out having to know a crap load of command line.

2010-10-17T02:29:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	indeed sir, indeed
2010-10-17T02:31:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	u may not be able to install login screen like from gnome-look.org, but u can customize the background picture and other various thins
2010-10-17T02:31:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	thats what ubuntu tweak helps in doing
2010-10-17T02:32:00.000Z	ace_steel	glitchd	is it similar to customizing the login window as on arch linux?
2010-10-17T02:32:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	i have no experience with arch really..
2010-10-17T02:33:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	i have used it a couple of times, and thats about it
2010-10-17T02:33:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	as far as i know u can customize the arch login the same way u used to be able to in the older ubuntu
2010-10-17T02:34:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	with packages from gnome-look.org
2010-10-17T02:35:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	however i dont use arch anymore, so dont quote me if it doesnt work..
2010-10-17T02:36:00.000Z	glitchd	ace_steel	u laugh, but people get really mad when things dont work
