2008-12-21T07:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		lord_hypnos; ifconfig and look for inet addr:
2008-12-21T07:45:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		lord_hypnos; no, you're using a wired connection?
2008-12-21T07:45:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		kudar; yes it would upgrade your version to Intrepid
2008-12-21T07:45:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		lord_hypnos; okay, on eth0 what is the inet addr: and Bcast:
2008-12-21T07:46:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		kudar; i don't know, i still use hardy.
2008-12-21T07:46:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		lord_hypnos; fine, what is it for eth1
2008-12-21T07:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		kudar; i'm going for stability rather than latest and greatest. this is a home business box that i can't afford to spend 1 minute of downtime.
2008-12-21T07:49:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	if that is what you are going for:  then ubuntu LTS is probably the best for you...
2008-12-21T07:49:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	stick with hardy then.... personally I think it is really really good.
2008-12-21T07:49:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	 i tried an upgrade; ended up regressing.
2008-12-21T07:50:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	what is wrong then??
2009-09-13T07:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	on my resume it takes about 25 seconds to reconnect to the AP. a delay is normal.
2009-09-13T07:48:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	 but i can always see the network before it connects; i don't see anything :)
2009-09-13T07:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	does it reconnect immediately or take a few seconds?
2009-09-13T07:58:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	i can see it connecting to the internet through wicd; so i mean not immediate, but that is the norm for me; only about ten seconds, like you said.
2009-09-13T07:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	cool, glad unop fixed it.
2009-09-13T08:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	you suspend a desktop? i don't think my desktop has been turned off in the 4 years i've owned it. except power outages.
2009-09-13T08:02:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	can't sleep with it on
2009-09-13T08:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	cpufreq-info  .. what output do you get?
2009-09-13T08:05:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	installing now :)
2009-09-13T08:06:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	still says that i can't however.
2009-09-13T08:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	FAJ	bummer. although, in my brain, it is odd to regulate a desktop :)
2009-09-13T08:07:00.000Z	FAJ	bastid_raZor	i just want the FAN to be regulated :) lol
