2009-02-12T11:47:00.000Z	mgmuscari		looks like i dropped in at the right moment - people discussing ati drivers
2009-02-12T11:48:00.000Z	mgmuscari		does anybody here have any info that's newer than november on dri2 support?
2009-02-12T11:48:00.000Z	mgmuscari		gnea: i'm getting frustrated with flickering, as i imagine a lot of people are ;)
2009-02-12T11:50:00.000Z	mgmuscari		gnea: indeed. i'm on a thinkpad w500. any opengl or windowed video flickers when i'm using compiz fusion. this seems to be a very, very common problem, since there aren't any ati drivers right now with dri2 support
2009-02-12T11:50:00.000Z	mgmuscari		gnea: but i haven't heard anything since november regarding this support. it seems like people just stopped talking about it.
2009-02-12T11:51:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	I'm optimistic and assuming they stopped talking because they're coding
2009-02-12T11:51:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	I have absolutely no evidence for this though. I just like being optimistic :)
2009-02-12T11:52:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	i should hope so. i wish i knew more about linux drivers and ati's hardware so that i could contribute
2009-02-12T11:54:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	aww, now you had me go to cgit.freedesktop.org and find no commits on the relevant branches (I think) since november :(
2009-02-12T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	yeah that's why i've been miffed :(
2009-02-12T12:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	so you think it's looking bad for dri2, eh?
2009-02-12T12:12:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	I'm sort of in the same boat as you, wondering if I could learn enough about drivers in a sane amount of time to help this along
2009-02-12T12:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	my thoughts exactly. too much going on with work right now to get into it though :'(
2009-02-12T12:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	what graphics chipset are you running?
2009-02-12T12:13:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	9600xt
2009-02-12T12:13:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	man, that's something that should be very well supported by now. i feel your pain
2009-02-12T12:13:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	at first i thought it was just because i have a weird mobile card. firegl v5700
2009-02-12T12:14:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	it works quite nicely as long as I don't try to do anything 3d-ish while compiz is compositing. google earth runs ok, compiz runs ok (including textured xv), just both at the same time breaks.
2009-02-12T12:14:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	xscreensaver doesn't like to work correctly with compiz
2009-02-12T12:15:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	yeah, same root issue probably, google earth was just the first 3d app I actually use that came to mind
2009-02-12T12:16:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	from what i understand, since compiz is opengl any time another process tries to write to the buffer they collide and cause the flickering; somehow lack of dri2 disables a back buffer somewhere along the way...
2009-02-12T12:20:00.000Z	mzz	mgmuscari	what display resolution are you running? :P
2009-02-12T12:21:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	1920x1200
2009-02-12T12:21:00.000Z	mgmuscari	mzz	native resolution of the TFT panel on this laptop
