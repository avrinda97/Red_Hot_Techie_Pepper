2008-04-01T04:28:00.000Z	valros		idk i cant see what it detects only tell it to look for something
2008-04-01T04:28:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	does 'iwscan ap' say anything? (is that even the right syntax?)
2008-04-01T04:30:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	'iwlist ap'
2008-04-01T04:31:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	define 'any'   What were the interface names it gave?
2008-04-01T04:33:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	how are you trying to make it work? (which program? the little gnome toolbar applet thing?)
2008-04-01T04:33:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	should work ;)
2008-04-01T04:34:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	try setting the essid manually: 'iwconfig wlan0 essid <whatever it is>'
2008-04-01T04:34:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	so the gnome applet sees the netgear ESSID?
2008-04-01T04:34:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	if so, ignore my previous suggestion
2008-04-01T04:35:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	try setting the essid manually
2008-04-01T04:36:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	if 'iwlist ap'  isn't showin anything, it means 1 of 3 things: 1) there aren't any APs in range 2) your stuff's broke 3) other
2008-04-01T04:37:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	I'm just trying to isolate it
2008-04-01T04:48:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	try to isolate where the problem is (set essid manually, then set IP manually and that sort of thing, and do ping tests and all that)
2008-04-01T04:49:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	start by pinging the IP of your Access Point (AP), then move on to something further away
2008-04-01T04:49:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	I assume your access point works with whatever you're using to connect right now?
2008-04-01T04:51:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	again, try to isolate where the problem is (set essid manually, then set IP manually and that sort of thing, and do ping tests and all that)
2008-04-01T04:51:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	if the router is working, then the system must be wrong.  Set things manually to reasonable values and see if it works
2008-04-01T04:52:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	it may end up being that the driver the system (or you, if you pickked it) is using for your wireless card is wrong.
2008-04-01T04:53:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	 they're separate hardware on the router, the wirelss and the ethernet
2008-04-01T04:53:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	sunspots?
2008-04-01T04:54:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	sunspots are more likely...it's well-known that they interfere with certain RF applications ;)
2008-04-01T04:55:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	I'm beingfacetious, of course, (sunspots only affect long wavelength propogation :P)..  But yeah, try and set some stuff manually, tell me how it goes.
2008-04-01T05:00:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	Sorry I'm not better help.  Wifi is one of those things that isn't very consistent :)
2008-04-01T05:00:00.000Z	Sinistrad	valros	I mean ... invisible waves of electromagnetic energy? wtf?
