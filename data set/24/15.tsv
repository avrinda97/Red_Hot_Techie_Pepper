2004-09-27T12:57:00.000Z	nictuku		congrats for ubuntu!
2004-09-27T12:59:00.000Z	nictuku		does ubuntu ships with postfix?
2004-09-27T12:59:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	by default!
2004-09-27T13:01:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	no, those are from our repositories too
2004-09-27T13:01:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	but we only do support for our 'main' ones, not our 'universe' ones
2004-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	we're not going to sell ubuntu
2004-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	but we're going to support it, and partner to support it
2004-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	if you have any suggestions, please mail jeff.waugh@canonical.com :-) thanks!
2004-10-05T07:54:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	sorry I lost my scroll history. Is your mail jeff.waugh AT canonical.com ?
2004-10-10T06:26:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	which mail?
2004-10-10T07:40:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	I've sent you a message about a support partnership in sept 23, I think.
2004-10-10T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	can you resend?
2004-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	interested in making gnome useful on old hardware, sure, but it's challenging. basically, you just need 256MB RAM or above.
2004-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	I see. I do not want to start a flamewar here. But does linux/X/gnome miss something to run "fine" in a low end machine, or is it just too "feature-full"? I mean, win98 runs fine here.
2004-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	gnome (and other desktop components) does a heck of a lot more than win98
2004-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	there are lots of things that need optimisation - it's just a matter of time
2004-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	it's more fun working on new stuff than fixing old code :)
2004-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	hehe.
2005-01-30T17:12:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	#ubuntu-pt might help :)
2005-01-30T17:12:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	hmm I'm trying to find some other members to #ubuntu-br :)
2005-01-30T17:13:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	aha
2005-01-30T17:13:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	that's an entirely different matter then :)
2005-01-30T17:13:00.000Z	jdub	nictuku	estou procurando minhas calas!
2005-01-30T17:13:00.000Z	nictuku	jdub	hehe
