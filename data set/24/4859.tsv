2007-03-16T07:20:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	what do you mean you cant get java to work? can you elaborate?
2007-03-16T07:21:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	you have the correct java working you think?
2007-03-16T07:24:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	you need to prefix your response with a nick if it was meant for specific person
2007-03-16T07:25:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	how do i check if my java is working
2007-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	java --version, btw what makes you think your java is not working?
2007-03-16T07:29:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	: java --version doenst return anithing
2007-03-16T07:34:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	if java -version does not work maybe java is not installed
2007-03-16T07:38:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	what exactly are you trying to do or trying to achieve?
2007-03-16T07:38:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	: trying to get processing to work. But no java suport.
2007-03-16T07:38:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	it uses opengl just fine, just not java
2007-03-16T07:38:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	can you elaborate what do you mean by so-called processing?
2007-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	: oops, sorry, Processing is a program to make interactive visuals
2007-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	btw java does not solve all your programming issues
2007-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	yes i know, but a simple comnado like --backgraund(0); should work
2007-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	jikes is just another java derivative if i recall, can possibly be another jre..
2007-03-16T07:41:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	you're trying to program in java using swing or whatever their graphic classes are? can you visit the #java channel to get additional help?
2007-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	well, i already lost 2 hour trying to get it working. I guess i just got to dual boot and take it . thanks for your time. I'll try again tomorow or so
2007-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	yes, i'll take a strool down #java to see if they can help
2007-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	wasted two hours? nothing is wasted only gained the experience and learned :P
2007-03-16T07:43:00.000Z	fisheye	bulmer	: i just get sore eyes and delay my projects :P all the pron i could have downloaded ....
2007-03-16T07:44:00.000Z	bulmer	fisheye	now you're talking, that is surely a missed opportunities
