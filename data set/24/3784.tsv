2007-11-03T14:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight		i gotz a question about updating
2007-11-03T14:09:00.000Z	livingdaylight		ze updater is 'on' but the updates are for compiz. I don't use compiz but when i untick 'em the orange updater is still on
2007-11-03T14:11:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	dont un tick them then it wilupdate end of problem
2007-11-03T14:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	heh. if i don't untick 'em the updater will remain on aswell... maybe i don't understand your solution?
2007-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	What I am saying is let the updater do its job. Do not refuse any updates then when it finishes it should be ok
2007-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	i don't want to update compiz as i don't use compiz... why does update manager not recognize that i don't use compiz?? and stop feeding me things to update i don'tuse? Does Ubuntu use an intelligent updater or not? or do i have to update every thing regardless?
2007-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	pffff... right so i must not refuse any updates regardless whether they serve me or not..
2007-11-03T14:13:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	If compiz is installed then Yes it will want to update it..
2007-11-03T14:14:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	should i tell you again that i don't use compiz?
2007-11-03T14:15:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	I do not use compiz either but it still gets updated because it is installed
2007-11-03T14:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	that is really crap don't you think?
2007-11-03T14:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	first why install it if installer can see that my system cannot handle compiz?
2007-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	I do not know the answer to your questions but I do know if you have programs then the updater will (rightly) try to update them other posters are reccomending that you remove compiz
2007-11-03T14:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	i shall exterminate compiz from my computer...sanx
2007-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	This is too late advise but next time just do one thing and see what happens before you make some new change then it is easier to find the problem :)
2007-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	yea... i wish i could roll back the changes now :(
2007-11-03T15:56:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	did you look through your preferences to see if you can get some functions back??
2007-11-03T15:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	yea.. preference dialogs have changed too in part.. for eg prefernce dialog for workspaces usually lets you configure amount of windows and rows
2007-11-03T15:57:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	So can you have 4????
2007-11-03T15:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	no, just the one!
2007-11-03T15:58:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	Grrr!!
2007-11-03T15:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	jxxt	when i open Opera it takes up the entire screen's real estate
2007-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	jxxt	livingdaylight	Did the screen resolution change? maybe you change back and all is well????
