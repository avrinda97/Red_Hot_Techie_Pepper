2012-06-06T20:04:00.000Z	veryhappy		hey guys i got a question about libraries
2012-06-06T20:04:00.000Z	veryhappy		i wanted to install mysql-workbench but i can't because it says libmysqlclient16 is missing, how do i install this dependency?
2012-06-06T20:05:00.000Z	veryhappy		help is appreciated, thank you
2012-06-06T20:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	have you searched if theres a libmysqlclient16 in the repos?
2012-06-06T20:08:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	i did. nothing was displayed
2012-06-06T20:08:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	that would be apt-cache search libmysqlclient16 i suppose?
2012-06-06T20:10:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	yes, but I just don't have a ubuntu to check
2012-06-06T20:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	the app you want to install, where does it come from?
2012-06-06T20:16:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	do you mean the vendor?
2012-06-06T20:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	yes, I found  docs telling me that workbench should be supported in 10.04 and 12.04
2012-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	it is supported i guess, it just says: depency not complied libmysqlclient16 (>= 5.1.21-1)
2012-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	precise has the workbench in the universe repo. is the universe repo active?
2012-06-06T20:20:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	where can i check that? i have no synaptic installed
2012-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	i'm sorry, i have forgotten that i have to go for now
2012-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	open /etc/apt/sources.list and check /etc/apt/sources.list.d
2012-06-06T21:35:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	hello, i'm back. i've checked /etc/apt/sources.list and universe was activated
2012-06-06T21:54:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	do you have any suggestions for me?
2012-06-06T21:55:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	 no booting? hm
2012-06-06T21:55:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	sorry, it doesn't has to do with booting
2012-06-06T21:55:00.000Z	schnuffle	veryhappy	what was your problem again? :)
2012-06-06T21:56:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	not so bad, we are all human ;) i had the problem with workbench and libmysqlclient16 (i looked in /etc/apt/sources.lst and it was activated)
2012-06-06T21:56:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	universe was activated i mean
2012-06-06T22:04:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	?
2012-06-06T22:04:00.000Z	veryhappy	schnuffle	what would you do to install libmysqlclient16?
