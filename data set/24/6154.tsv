2005-12-30T07:57:00.000Z	voidfx		I'm getting xsession errors when trying to log in as my normal user
2005-12-30T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	paste the errors on the pastbin
2005-12-30T08:00:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	ifconfig -a
2005-12-30T08:02:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	did you play with a firewall?
2005-12-30T08:03:00.000Z	voidfx	Seveas	not to the best of my knowledge, but I'm still very much the newb.
2005-12-30T08:03:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	very weird then
2005-12-30T08:03:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	ls -al ~ (as you, not as root) and output on the pastebin
2005-12-30T08:03:00.000Z	voidfx	Seveas	I did download a bunch of stuff from the repository...
2005-12-30T08:04:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	then do it in a terminal via <alt><f1>
2005-12-30T08:05:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	in the terminal: wget http://ubuntulinux.nl/python/pastebin && ls -al ~ | python pastebin
2005-12-30T08:06:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	in that case:
2005-12-30T08:06:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	in the terminal: wget http://ubuntulinux.nl/python/pastebin && ls -al /home/your_normal_username | python pastebin
2005-12-30T08:08:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	in the terminal: wget http://ubuntulinux.nl/files/pastebin && ls -al /home/your_normal_username | python pastebin
2005-12-30T08:13:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	yes
2005-12-30T08:13:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	and just to be sure: clean out /tmp
2005-12-30T08:14:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	yeah
2005-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	use gksudo or sudo -i
2005-12-30T08:15:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	that you can login afterwards :)
2005-12-30T08:16:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	gui programs should *always* be started via gksudo instead of sudo
2005-12-30T08:17:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	the thing that all menu entries that require you to type your pw use
2005-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	yup
2005-12-30T08:29:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	?
2005-12-30T08:32:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	the HAL problem would explain this....
2005-12-30T08:33:00.000Z	Seveas	voidfx	can you put your xorg log on the pastebin please
