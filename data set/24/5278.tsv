2006-08-29T09:09:00.000Z	ross		Can anyone help me connecting my laptop to my wireless router?
2006-08-29T09:10:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	do you have your card hooked into your laptop?
2006-08-29T09:10:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	what distro?  Ubuntu?
2006-08-29T09:12:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	OK su to root, then type ifconfig to make sure you have the required utilities.
2006-08-29T09:14:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	Oh wait! I got that wrong...you want iwconfig not ifconfig...OK su to root and type iwconfig.
2006-08-29T09:18:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	Type sudo ifconfig eth0 up
2006-08-29T09:19:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	if eth0 is your interface...it could be eth1, etc.
2006-08-29T09:19:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	not iw
2006-08-29T09:20:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	no nothing would
2006-08-29T09:20:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	check it by running sudo ifconfig
2006-08-29T09:23:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	did ifconfig say that you had any interfaces up?
2006-08-29T09:27:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	do you see a new one-on-one window...I wanna talk to you on a private channel.
2006-08-29T09:29:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	it should've reopened cuz I sent another message
2006-08-29T09:32:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	did you find the private chat window?
2006-08-29T09:33:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	yep OK switch to that window
2006-08-29T09:34:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	Is eth0 your wireless interface?
2006-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	lo is loopback...ignore that
2006-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	btw I had the exact same prob you had a long time ago...it's even more of a b**** on Debian.
2006-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	but ifconfig lists eth0 as an interface
2006-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	absolutely yes
2006-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	do you have an aim account?
2006-08-29T09:37:00.000Z	peteweez	ross	logon to aim and add peteweez to your buddy list
