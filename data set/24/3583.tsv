2007-12-22T00:39:00.000Z	andruk	Newuserr	i would uninstall it and use flashplugin-nonfree instead

2007-12-22T00:42:00.000Z	Newuserr	andruk	i got everything working well on ubuntu 7.06 bit strange
2007-12-22T00:43:00.000Z	andruk	Newuserr	tis strange indeed
2007-12-22T00:44:00.000Z	Newuserr	andruk	i did what u told me but now when i am on youtube.com they tell me to install the flashplayer but i have installed the flashplugin-nonfree???
2007-12-22T00:45:00.000Z	andruk	Newuserr	yeah, as it says in the channel topic, the flashplugin-nonfree is currently broken (by Adobe), so it will be a little while before somebody updates it
2007-12-22T00:45:00.000Z	andruk	Newuserr	the issue should be fixed "soon"
