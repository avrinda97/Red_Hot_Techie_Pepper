2006-08-09T08:05:00.000Z	kevin1		I am trying to burn a DVD-Data Disc with k3b and I am receiving a error: Incorrectly encoded string (ffchen.jpg) encountered.   I there a way i can find/delete the file?  I have no idea what it is or where it is.
2006-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	kevin1		I've done a search and I don't come back with anything... I am confused
2006-08-09T08:08:00.000Z	kevin1		anyone familar with this error and k3b?
2006-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	sounds like a bad filename to me ...see that squarebox thing?
2006-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	maybe just rename the file
2006-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	kevin1	orbin	 I don't know what the file is or where it is... I've done a search
2006-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	HDD > DVD or DVD > DVD?
2006-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	kevin1	orbin	 HDD>DVD
2006-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	and you can't find *ffchen.jpg?

2006-08-09T08:14:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	the ffchen.jpg file is there somewhere
2006-08-09T08:15:00.000Z	kevin1	orbin	nope... but i saw that eariler... didn't help much of anything
2006-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	kevin1	orbin	 I did start--> search for files *chen.jpg and get nothing when choosing the whole filesystem
2006-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	sudo updatedb
2006-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	then: locate *chen*.jpg

2006-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	my guess is the search utility hasn't updated it's db for a while
2006-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	orbin	kevin1	if it even has one ... not sure
