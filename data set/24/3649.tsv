2009-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	overlord		I am using ubuntu 9.04 64 bit. My sound suddenly stopped functioning. Any fix?
2009-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	same here
2009-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	lol
2009-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	fixed ?
2009-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	since the last HAL update?
2009-06-20T16:51:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	probably. I don't remember exactly.
2009-06-20T16:51:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	nope, not fixed, and no-one here seems to have any idea
2009-06-20T16:51:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	what hardware you running, out of interest?
2009-06-20T16:51:00.000Z	Rohaq		I'm on an Acer Aspire One here
2009-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	if I attempt to un-mute my sound, my display turns on and off, fun times :P
2009-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	 intel p4 3ghz ht. 1gb ram. nvidia 8800 GTS 320 mb,
2009-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	not likely a common hardware component then :)
2009-06-20T16:53:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	Turn off and turn on ? Lol. That doesn't happen here.
2009-06-20T16:53:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	What hardware you got ?
2009-06-20T16:54:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	And it doesn't seem to be a hardware fault to me. I got XP on one of the partition. And I tested the sound there, it worked fine.
2009-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	Rohaq	overlord	it's an Acer Aspire One, 1.6GHz Atom, 1.5GB RAM, Intel 945GSE Express graphics
2009-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	overlord		hmm
2009-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	Rohaq		not sure about the sound hardware
2009-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	Rohaq		or if our problems are even related, hehe
2009-06-20T16:55:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	yeh
2009-06-20T16:56:00.000Z	Rohaq		does seem odd though
2009-06-20T16:57:00.000Z	Rohaq		anyone here know how to roll back particular packages?
2009-06-20T16:57:00.000Z	Rohaq		see if we can't test this stuff out?
2009-06-20T17:01:00.000Z	overlord	Rohaq	ubuntu is recognizing my sound card.
