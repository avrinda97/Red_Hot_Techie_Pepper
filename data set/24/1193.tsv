2010-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	CTRL	histo	it is an EIDE drive, the kind with the wide ribbon cable.
2010-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	CTRL	histo	I have no idea what the enclosure came from, I have never used one with this computer.
2010-05-22T11:15:00.000Z	histo	CTRL	maybe for the mybook

2010-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	CTRL	histo	I'm not sure what kind of mobo it is, and there is only one drive connected at the moment, the one that it isn't recognizing.
2010-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	histo	CTRL	has the drive worked in any other os's?
2010-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	histo	CTRL	does it get detected in the bios
2010-05-22T11:17:00.000Z	CTRL	histo	yes, it used to have windows xp on it, and it does get detected by bios
2010-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	histo	CTRL	I have no idea perhaps others here can give you some more insight.  I would start looking at the controller module
2010-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	CTRL	histo	ok, thanks for trying.  I'll see if I can find my XP cd and see if I can install that again.
