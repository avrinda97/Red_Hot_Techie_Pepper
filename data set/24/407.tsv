2011-09-29T19:17:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		Hi, I'm having some issues and I was wondering if anyone had some time to help, I'll explain...
2011-09-29T19:17:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		I installed ubuntu 10.10 a while ago, alongside windows vista, and everything was going fine, but I didn't use it for a while, I left the PC at my girlfriends for a while
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ZeidDiez	reinstall
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64		:)
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		and she thought it would be a good idea to just delete the partition ubuntu was on from within windows manager thing
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		now the computer starts and says "grub recovery"
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		and cannot find a filesystem
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ZeidDiez	youll need to reinstall ubuntu which will redo grub
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		Allright, sorry
2011-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		I reinstalled ubuntu 10.10 and even tried kubuntu 11.04
2011-09-29T19:19:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ZeidDiez	grub is on but has nothing to boot
2011-09-29T19:19:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		and still got grub recovery
2011-09-29T19:19:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		is there any way to default back to windows' old MBR? I only ever use ubuntu on a live CD
2011-09-29T19:20:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		I have windows vista x64 home premium, but it doesn't have my raid drivers
2011-09-29T19:20:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		would it even fix an MBR issue? I attempted "repair" with a win7 dvd
2011-09-29T19:20:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		and it did nothing
2011-09-29T19:22:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		Is there a way to uninstall grub? and would that default me to just windows?
2011-09-29T19:22:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		I did reinstall ubuntu and even tried kubuntu on the same drive, but it still took me to grub recovery
2011-09-29T19:24:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		The computer was running fine in windows when I got there, I restarted and I got the grub errors. Live CD finds the HD and all the windows file just fine.
2011-09-29T19:24:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		And win 7 install dvd says there's vista on that partition.
2011-09-29T21:17:00.000Z	ZeidDiez		Would I be able to use an ubuntu 10.10 live cd to burn an ISO? (As in, are there programs to do that within the live CD? Because I've no internet on the machine)
2011-09-29T21:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ZeidDiez	if you have a 2nd cd drive
2011-09-29T21:18:00.000Z	ZeidDiez	Gentoo64	I'm booting the livecd from USB
2011-09-29T21:18:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ZeidDiez	yes you can then
