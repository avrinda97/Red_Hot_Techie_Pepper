2006-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	elvstone		hum. i'm trying to add a user to a group with "sudo usermod -G video pow", but the user is not added to the group :/
2006-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	elvstone		e.g. grep pow /etc/group after that command gives nothing :/
2006-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	sudo adduser elvstone video
2006-08-22T09:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	sudo adduser pow video
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	but the login already exists, i'd like to modify it.
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	i used useradd -m -s /bin/bash pow to add it btw..
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	sudo adduser pow video   adds the existing pow to the group
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	useradd is, um, old?
2006-08-22T09:18:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	oh. okay. why doesn't usermod -G work? it usually does..
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	it's standard isn't it?
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	adduser/deluser has been standard in debian for years now
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	alright, sorry, coming from BSD :)
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	thanks!
2006-08-22T09:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	np, many similarities, and a few gotchas, heh
2006-08-22T09:20:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	hm. it's still not added, sudo adduser pow video && grep pow /etc/group yields nothing :/
2006-08-22T09:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	okay, first off, your user has sudo permissions, right?
2006-08-22T09:21:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	yep. i'm using my regular login 'elvstone'.
2006-08-22T09:21:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	and it has sudo permission (i use it all the time).
2006-08-22T09:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	sudo vigr should work, but the other should have as well
2006-08-22T09:22:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	alright. i'll try with vigr.
2006-08-22T09:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	i don't normally recommend vi-ish things, but you're from bsd :)
2006-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	oops, sorry. did the sudo adduser in the wrong VT the first time :)
2006-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	elvstone	eyequeue	worked fine now.
2006-08-22T09:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	elvstone	glad to hear there was a sensible explanation :)
