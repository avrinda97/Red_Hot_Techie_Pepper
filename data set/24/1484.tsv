2010-01-03T05:01:00.000Z	Maletor		In Ubuntu 9.10 when I'm scaling a window I don't want to see an orange transparent symbol of what the new size will look like, I just want the window to scale there automatically, a la Mac OS X. What can I do to fix this, do I need CompizConfig because I have it.
2010-01-03T05:02:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	yeah, it's in compizconfig: go look at the resize plugin :)
2010-01-03T05:06:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	good! :)
2010-08-23T06:03:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	Try the lazy option.
2010-08-23T06:03:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	being?
2010-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	-l
2010-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	try umount -f    (force) still.
2010-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	Try force first*
2010-08-23T06:04:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	Maletor is not a command as far as I know. I did try umount -f
2010-08-23T06:05:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	You mean umount -fl /dev/md1?
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	Try umount -f   and then umount -l
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	n4xus you guys are right
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	Read the man page about what umount -l does though.
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	I'm right about what?
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	it worked :)
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	-l  is lazy un mount.  It's in the man page.  It says "unmount when you're ready"  The fs unmounts itself.
2010-08-23T06:07:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	It usually works for me too when a fs is "busy"  :)
2010-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	You can't unmount /
2010-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	Perhaps you can and no program can be run again.
2010-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	Then why would opening terminal say: there was an error creating child process for this terminal
2010-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	ha.  Perhaps you did! :)
2010-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	christ. and that means i can't dissasemble my raid because it can't even get bash let along mdadm
2010-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	Maletor	edbian	what's the process for mounting my drives on the live cd and starting up the raid over there. last time i tried to `mount /dev/sda /mnt/sda` it didn't work...
2010-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	edbian	Maletor	I don't know how to set up raid :(  Never done it!
