2009-03-11T21:10:00.000Z	Bakefy		Is there anyway that I can add a resolution to ubuntu?  its not the best for this monitor
2009-03-11T21:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	have you got the graphics card driver installed?
2009-03-11T21:11:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	I believe I do
2009-03-11T21:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	no you won't have unless you installed it yourself
2009-03-11T21:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	system >  administaration >  hardware drivers
2009-03-11T21:12:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	thanks... I don't even know what this thing has.
2009-03-11T21:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	get that thing installed and then you will probably have more resoloution options
2009-03-11T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	oh old HP hummmmm
2009-03-11T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	ok tell me if anything is in hardware drivers
2009-03-11T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	which version of Ubuntu, and how old is the HP?
2009-03-11T21:14:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	- Ubuntu 8.04, its an HP Pavilion a620n
2009-03-11T21:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	ok it is hardy good, but  a server hummmm. well you don't need much of a resoloution on a server, if your using it as a server LOL
2009-03-11T21:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	I mean proper servers just do their thing and that's it, not used for anything else
2009-03-11T21:16:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	you're right.  Normally I dont isntall anything on server... no GUI at all... but this time i did in hopes of eventually installing backend mythtv
2009-03-11T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	ok I guess since it's an old computer, that could be why you hardly got any resolutions
2009-03-11T21:19:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	like none of the aspects are right for a widescreen monitor
2009-03-11T21:20:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	but its okay, I will just let this sit after time... I put 2 1.5 TB drives in it :)
2009-03-11T21:22:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	I am ready to move on...  I do have another question you might be able to guide me in the right direction... iSCSI.  I want to share to a windows server.
2009-03-11T21:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	hummmmmm not sure, but Samba does Windows files
2009-03-11T21:23:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	that would be easy.  I wanted to control permissions with the windows box.  I beleive iscsi is the only way.  Only because I have a domain controller
2009-03-11T21:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	maybe they can help in #Windows :D  plus  some  Linux people go there
2009-03-11T21:24:00.000Z	Bakefy	sebsebseb	if i could do it with SMB I would.
2009-03-11T21:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	ok sure
2009-03-11T21:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bakefy	oh yeah and this is more general  Linux channel #linux
