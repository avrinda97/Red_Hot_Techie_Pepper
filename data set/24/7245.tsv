2005-11-07T17:14:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	do you not read private messages any more?
2006-05-27T08:58:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	I don't understand what your asking, is it (remember I don't understand) apt-cache policy package (but I think not)
2006-05-27T08:59:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	I'm asking for debconf-get-selections on not installed packages
2006-05-27T09:00:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	 debconf-show  ?
2006-05-27T09:02:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	I am only guessing from this "man -k debconf!
2006-05-27T09:02:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	I am only guessing from this "man -k debconf" even
2006-05-27T09:02:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	that works on local db, so no
2006-09-11T16:48:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	is composite like the xgl stuff?
2006-09-11T16:48:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	#ubuntu-xgl is usually the best place for that one
2006-09-11T16:50:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	sorry is that composite != compiz  (I'm getting confused, and as you know that is not too hard for me to do ;-))
2006-09-11T16:50:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	yes, one is a wm, one an xorg extension
2006-09-11T16:51:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	compiz is a wm using xgl
2006-09-11T16:51:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	http://principe.homelinux.net/
2006-09-11T16:51:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	there is one guy who loves getting his fingers dirty with lots of that, DBO find him in #ubuntu-xgl and other places like offtopic and here give him a few hours
2006-09-11T16:52:00.000Z	ompaul	spike	that is he likes using them all and working out how they work
2006-09-11T16:52:00.000Z	spike	ompaul	will try...
