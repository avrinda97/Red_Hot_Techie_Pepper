2006-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	krazykit		though i think i'll dist-upgrade to edgy once i back up my laptop
2006-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	have you actually used compiz?
2006-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	yeah.  i have.
2006-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	so, then you should know you can turn most of the effects of and have a smooth desktop. It's the best thing that have happened to OS'ses in a long time.
2006-09-19T07:20:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	my other issue is that i don't much like compiz as my WM.
2006-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	why's that?
2006-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	i like the way e17 works better :-P
2006-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	I've had e17 and it's great, but really, really buggy.
2006-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	i've not had any major issues in the past, say year.
2006-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	are you using the whole e17 or just the window-manager?
2006-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	the whole e17 IS the window manager.  i don't really use many of the efl based apps though
2006-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	isn't enlightenment the WM and e17 the whole desktop?
2006-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	nah, e17 is sorta the name for the WM and the supporting libraries
2006-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	they quote about enlightenment window manager on their web-page, but who wants argue about semantics anyways.
2006-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	my point being: the window manager might be okay, the whole desktop-thing just isn't ready or stable.
2006-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	it's not supposed to be a whole-desktop thing right now.  it's not feature-complete yet :-P
2006-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	well, neither is the window manager announced stable.. neither is compiz though.
2006-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	I don't mind the window manager part of enlightenment at all. It's nice.
2006-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	i've been using it as my WM on both my machines for a year now :-)
2006-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	I don't see how it could compete with compiz if your hardware were supported, but it's okay ;)
2006-09-19T07:29:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	meh, just personal preference.
2006-10-13T07:45:00.000Z	Samuli^	krazykit	what do you mean by certain.. if they indeed seem like random try to find a common deminator between them :P
2006-10-13T07:45:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	they're from the same album :-P.  all the other FLAC files i have play fine but these.
2006-10-13T07:47:00.000Z	krazykit	Samuli^	meh.  reencoding it seems to fix it.  bah.
