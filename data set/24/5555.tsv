2010-01-24T02:14:00.000Z	duckx0r		where is the default local mail storage in ubuntu?
2010-01-24T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	why do you think there is one?  Ubuntu doesn't ship with any sort of MTA
2010-09-21T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	no idea.  Have you tried exploring gconf?
2010-09-21T01:12:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	is there a specific file i should be looking at?
2010-09-21T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	run gconf-editor and explore, that would be my guess as to where you can change it
2010-09-21T01:14:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	are all the settings stored in ~/.gconf ?
2010-09-21T01:14:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	the easier route is to just create a custom keyboard shortcut and have it run the command you want.  ~/.gconf isn't really relevant to what I said.  You shouldn't interact with gconf by editing files
2010-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	ok thanks
2010-09-21T01:18:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	gnome-settings-daemon source seems to just execute "gcalctool"
2010-09-21T01:19:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	so if i create another shortcut in gconf-editor will it overwrite the current one?
2010-09-21T01:20:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	not sure what you want to overwrite.  Just create a new key binding for the calculator key on your keyboard and have it call whatever command you want
2010-09-21T01:22:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	what is the keybinding for the calculator key? i.e. what do I type in gconf-editor for the keyboard shortcut?
2010-09-21T01:23:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	if you really want to use gconf-editor for some strange reason, copy what your current calculator key shortcut uses.  It's probably easier to use compiz setting manager to make the shortcut though as you can just press the key you want
2010-09-21T01:24:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	the current calculator key shortcut isn't in the gconf-editor, and I'm using metacity, not compiz
2010-09-21T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	the key is likely XF86Calculator, but just use the keybinding program that gnome comes with to create a keybinding for some arbitrary action and use the information in gconf for that keybinding to help you create the new one
2010-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	ahhh.... I didn't see the "Add" button at the bottom. That would have saved me a lot of time :P Thanks!
2010-09-21T01:28:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	that must be new, I didn't even know about that
2010-11-12T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	how did you create a user without a password?
2010-11-12T19:20:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	`passwd -d {username}`
2010-11-12T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	ah well don't know how to tell the user switcher not to ask for a pw in that case
2010-11-12T19:21:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	do you know how to tell it not to ask for a pw if there is one set?
2010-11-12T19:22:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	I think I remember an option in the gui to have it never ask for a password, but I am not sure
2010-11-12T19:23:00.000Z	duckx0r	jrib	that's only on login in the gdm
2010-11-12T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	duckx0r	you may be right
