2008-06-27T19:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		Armada What makes you think that..  very unlikely
2008-06-27T19:43:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	I've had multiple instances where parts of files get damaged, while on windows I've never had this problem
2008-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	I've had it with multiple drives and on one of the drives I run both ubuntu and windows and only have the problem in ubutnu
2008-06-27T19:46:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	no, it happens to all sort of files and it's pretty random
2008-06-27T19:48:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	yes, but I also have the problem within ubuntu. And I have the read-only option on. So windows isn't writing anything.
2008-06-27T19:49:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	then I would need to convert the drive to NTFS because I need to be able to use the files in windows without booting to ubuntu all the time
2008-06-27T19:50:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	not my ubuntu partition, it's a seperate drive, it never runs an OS
2008-06-27T19:51:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	FAT32 won't support large files
2008-06-27T19:52:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	okay, but will need to convert the seperate drive to NTFS
2008-06-27T19:53:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	NTFS is accesible from ubuntu just fine right?
2008-06-27T19:54:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	but that presents another problem. I've heard converting from ext3 to ntfs is risky
2008-06-27T19:57:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	I know, I know it very well, but I don't have the space for a complete backup, what I'm converting IS my backup XD
2008-06-27T19:57:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	I do plan on backuping all the important files
2008-06-28T19:03:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	okay, now I'm confused
2008-06-28T19:03:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	so it doesn't matter which parameter I use?
2008-06-28T19:04:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	so use that parameter instead of the ntfs parameter?
2008-06-28T19:04:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	and one last question, in my fstab what does gid=46 stand for?
2008-06-28T19:10:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	so it really doesn't matter?
2008-06-28T19:11:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	yes but I need to be able to do that
2008-06-28T19:12:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, then my last question, what is the gid=46 parameter for?
2008-06-28T19:14:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	it was automatically generated by the installation
2008-06-28T19:22:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, thanks a lot, I now understand a lot more about the fstab parameters
2008-06-28T19:23:00.000Z	Armada	Jack_Sparrow	yeah I found that one myself too eventually
