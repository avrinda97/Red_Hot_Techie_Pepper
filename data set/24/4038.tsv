2007-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	youknowme		I have two systems connected with a cat-5 crossover cable, and when I try to use vncviewer to connect to the other I get:
2007-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	youknowme		Couldn't convert 'joe-desktop' to host address
2007-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	youknowme		Unable to connect to VNC server
2007-10-16T05:51:00.000Z	youknowme		help?
2007-10-16T05:52:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	do they both have ips or did you unplug one from your router, leave it set to DHCP, and expect it to magically suck an IP address through the second computer?
2007-10-16T05:53:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	they are both set to dhcp, what would I change it to?
2007-10-16T05:55:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	hows the 2nd computer going to get an IP address if its only directly connected to the first?
2007-10-16T05:55:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	I didn't think of that, so.. how would I set it up?
2007-10-16T05:55:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	you'd give it a static IP
2007-10-16T05:56:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	just one?
2007-10-16T05:56:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	both might help if they're going to communicat back and forth
2007-10-16T05:57:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	so would it be something like
2007-10-16T05:58:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	sorry, I'm not sure I understand
2007-10-16T06:38:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	Did you set the gateways like I said?
2007-10-16T06:39:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	haven't got that far. still testing IPs and such because apparently they matter greatly
2007-10-16T06:39:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	hold on I'll try again
2007-10-16T06:39:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	uh.. yeah, they're rather important to the tcp/ip stack. You need to set the gateway to be the opposite computers
2007-10-16T06:41:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.2 with the mask set to 255.255.255.0 and the gateway set to 1.2 and 2.1?
2007-10-16T06:42:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	gateway set to 2.2 and 2.1.
2007-10-16T06:42:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	yes the gateway is the OTHEr computer
2007-10-16T06:43:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	ok brb
2007-10-16T06:50:00.000Z	youknowme	mrj	ok, the computers can ping each other when connected with the crossover cable but when I try to use vnc I get
2007-10-16T06:52:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	joe-desktop = an ip address right, and you just changed it to joe-desktop to clean it up or something?
2007-10-16T06:53:00.000Z	mrj	youknowme	you need to enter the ip, not "joes-desktop" if thats what you're doing
