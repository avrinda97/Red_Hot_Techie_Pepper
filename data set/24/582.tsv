2011-06-13T21:14:00.000Z	RA_drc		hi, how does ubuntu make an initial ram disk?
2011-06-13T21:15:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	you mean how it mounts one or how to create an initrd image?
2011-06-13T21:15:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	how to create one
2011-06-13T21:18:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	i already have those installed
2011-06-13T21:19:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	then man initramfs-tools
2011-08-05T22:27:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	disk utility or command line df -h
2011-08-05T22:31:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	thanks
2011-08-05T22:32:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	you can ctrl-c but you still lose stuff. it works as a depth first removal
2011-08-05T22:33:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	what i mean is, can i break without worrying about the hardware being damaged or the filesystem being negatively impacted
2011-08-05T22:34:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	no risk of that
2011-08-08T19:41:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	does the kernel see the partitions? cat /proc/partitions. also if you can provide more information about the card reader (model and driver) you can get that with lshw
2011-08-08T19:54:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	how long is lshw supposed to take?
2011-08-08T19:58:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	what about cat /proc/partitions? does the card show a fs on any of the exposed devices sdc-sde
2011-08-08T20:01:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	i don't think so, but i'm really not sure: http://pastebin.com/zz6Qjdin
2011-08-08T20:03:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	it looks like it is sde try mounting that
2011-08-08T20:05:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	i should type sudo mount /dev/sde /mnt ?
2011-08-08T20:06:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	sure, but it may be better to sudo mkdir /mnt/sdhc; sudo mount /dev/sde /mnt/sdhc
2011-08-08T20:09:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	when i run sudo mount /dev/sde /mnt/sdhc it hangs....it won't do anything.  what should i do?
2011-08-08T20:10:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	how badly is it hung?
2011-08-08T20:12:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	it won't terminate when i type ctrl-c
2011-08-08T20:15:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	but the computer is still responsive. it could be a bug in the driver for your device. have you tried searching for the device online?
2011-08-08T20:16:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	not yet, i'll see if i can find updated drivers online
2011-08-08T20:19:00.000Z	RA_drc	escott	i take that back - control-c will (eventually) break it properly
2011-08-08T20:20:00.000Z	escott	RA_drc	its just getting stuck as the kernel tries to read the fs. if it is very large and the device very slow that could take some time
