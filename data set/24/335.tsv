2012-01-26T06:35:00.000Z	richard3		hey guys
2012-01-26T06:36:00.000Z	richard3		i'd like some help with ubuntu, i just installed it however i have a problem when i stop using the hdmi output on it the machine stops working, so for example i've ssh'ed into it or vnc and I switch input to my cable box ssh stops responding and i lose the teamviewer connection
2012-01-26T06:37:00.000Z	richard3		disabling what device?
2012-01-26T06:38:00.000Z	richard3		like my computer is connected to my tv via hdmi, when i switch inputs to the tv channels i lose connection
2012-01-26T06:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	ssh cant be effected by hdmi
2012-01-26T06:39:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	its pretty easy to test, i do ls when video output is on, i switch out to the cable box, i cant do ls, and then my ssh connection times out
2012-01-26T06:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	switch out?
2012-01-26T06:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	cable? would that be the same cable the network is connected to?
2012-01-26T06:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	include the nick you are talking to
2012-01-26T06:42:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	i'm talking about switching between comcast cable on the tv and ubuntu on the tv, the box becomes unresponsive when hdmi output is lost
2012-01-26T06:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	i have a box with hdmi and i ssh to it all day, i cant see how hdmi changes would ever kill the ssh connection
2012-01-26T06:43:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	i effectively cant ping the box after video output is unused on the box
2012-01-26T06:43:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	how could i debug it?
2012-01-26T06:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	the box is running ubuntu? the one you are ssh'ing into to?
2012-01-26T06:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	the box is running ubuntu? the one you are ssh'ing into to?
2012-01-26T06:45:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	yeah ubuntu 11
2012-01-26T06:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	how about the easy ones? look at the logs? syslog ?
2012-01-26T06:47:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	heres a dmesg output of the event http://pastebin.com/B8ttKn3j
2012-01-26T06:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	hdmi not the issue, is the issue losing ssh connection?
2012-01-26T06:49:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	yeah but i cant see anything relevant in syslog
2012-01-26T06:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	richard3	well, you seem to know what is relevant and what is not, good luck
2012-01-26T06:50:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	well the last message relates to a system ugprade i did, like the action of switching outputs doesnt add anything to the logs, any other file i could check?
2012-01-26T06:54:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	i think i found something, simply the act of unplugging the hdmi cable doesnt do anything to the machine so it must be something else thanks for ur help
2012-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	richard3	almoxarife	i figured it out u'll never guess what it was
