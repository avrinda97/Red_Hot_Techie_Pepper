2007-02-28T10:55:00.000Z	squalooo		but it's only admin/root?
2007-02-28T10:57:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	I can't answer your question if i don't understand it.
2007-02-28T10:43:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	you can run commands as root using the sudo command
2007-02-28T10:44:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	logging in as root is never needed and should never be done.
2007-02-28T10:44:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	what is the command ?
2007-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	sudo
2007-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	as "Super-UserDO"
2007-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	just prefix sudo to any command you want to run as root.
2007-02-28T10:46:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	why?
2007-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	did you read me? you won't login as root.
2007-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	you can run any command as root by using:    sudo <command>
2007-02-28T10:48:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	you will never need it.
2007-02-28T10:49:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	but if i create another account called "afflux", you're logged, you can connected as root?
2007-02-28T10:49:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	no. the user has to be in certain groups for this.
2007-02-28T10:50:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	 i don't understand :P
2007-02-28T10:50:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	users in linux are in "groups", which will allow them to access different parts of the system.
2007-02-28T10:51:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	i'm not sure which group this was, but I think they need to be in the group "admin" to have access to sudo.
2007-02-28T10:53:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	 but i when installed ubuntu, i create account "enzo", it is the main account?
2007-02-28T10:54:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	yes. and he is in every admin group.
2007-02-28T10:57:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	it's true?
2007-02-28T10:57:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	don't understand the question.
2007-02-28T11:01:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	yes. but if you create new users you can give them the rights, if you wan to.
2007-02-28T11:04:00.000Z	afflux	squalooo	no problem.
2007-02-28T11:04:00.000Z	squalooo	afflux	another question! can i installed di wifi ?
