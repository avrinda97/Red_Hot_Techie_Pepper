2011-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	yellowhead		help please.. update manager just stopped working.. same thing with synaptic.. i'm behind a proxy server.. and from what i can see, it is all set up correctly in synaptic->preferences->network tab.
2011-06-30T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	is your web browser using the same proxy ?
2011-06-30T14:11:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- my web browser is using same proxy.. even pidgin (from where i am chatting to you right now)
2011-06-30T14:11:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	ok, so that confirms the proxy is working, good. what happens if in the terminal you do "sudo apt-get update"
2011-06-30T14:13:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- the specific message is:  Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/i18n/Translation-en_ZA.bz2  Unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com:http: [IP: 91.189.92.170 80]
2011-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	I'm assuming that IP is not the proxy IP
2011-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	that's the repo ID I'm assuming
2011-06-30T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	yellowhead ok
2011-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	try setting the proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf
2011-06-30T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	or set httpd_proxy=http://yourproxyu.com:8080(your port) and then run it
2011-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- i saw that is a forum, tried it, but it didn't work for me..
2011-06-30T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	which one ?
2011-06-30T14:18:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- the one of setting the proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf
2011-06-30T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	really, try setting the http_proxy environment variable, see if it changes anything
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- i also tried that.. using export http_proxy ="http -blah-blah" still no luck!
2011-06-30T14:19:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- i have tried most of the stuff one can get from google.. :P
2011-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	I'm not getting this from google, have you tried setting http_proxy ?
2011-06-30T14:20:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- yes. isn't it using the export command? or is there some other way of doing so?
2011-06-30T14:22:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- well not quite using export.. but i just tried http_proxy="http://myproxy:port" still no luck
2011-06-30T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	have you set the http_proxy environment varible ?
2011-06-30T14:29:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- how/where do i set that?
2011-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	it's an environment varible, http_proxy=http://servername:port
2011-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	yellowhead	ikonia	- yes i did.. still had the same issue
2011-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	yellowhead	ok, what is your proxy IP address ?
