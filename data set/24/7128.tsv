2005-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	epicenter		Hrm, is there a good reason for a new Ubuntu installation with barely anything added to use 5.0 GB already? What are  some huge things installed by defualt that can be removed?
2005-04-21T05:24:00.000Z	epicenter		*default
2005-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	apt-get's cache maybe?
2005-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	epicenter	Fator_Dee	What about it?
2005-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	that takes up space
2005-04-21T05:25:00.000Z	epicenter		where's it located?
2005-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	/var/apt/cache I think
2005-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	let me check
2005-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	epicenter		found it
2005-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	epicenter		thx
2005-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	epicenter		var/cache/apt
2005-04-21T05:27:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	damn, wrong way around :-)
2005-04-21T05:29:00.000Z	epicenter		LiVES absolutely must be compiled? No DEBs exist?
2005-04-21T05:31:00.000Z	epicenter		LiVES, when attempting to ./configure, says it needs "gtk+2.0". I have gtk 2.0. What the hell?
2005-04-21T05:31:00.000Z	epicenter		which ones?
2005-04-21T05:33:00.000Z	epicenter		I Deleted my apt cache and now I get, "E: Archive directory /var/cache/apt/archives/partial is missing". How do I fix this? :P
2005-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	did you manually clean the cache?
2005-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	epicenter	Fator_Dee	yes.
2005-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	epicenter		I just erased the dir contents of /cache/apt/archives
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	apt-get clean/autoclean would have been the right way...
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	sorry for not mentioning that
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	epicenter	Fator_Dee	is this woeful fuckery of mine fixable?
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	epicenter		not your fault
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	epicenter	I think that it's not so dangerous, but I don't know what to do
