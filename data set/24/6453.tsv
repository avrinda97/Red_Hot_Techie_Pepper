2006-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	tsume	little advice i dont think getting cds from shipit atm is a great idea
2006-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	is there something wrong with the cds they sent me?
2006-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	the installer worked for me on several computers...
2006-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	tsume	non of my 25 work
2006-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	oh boy :) wel I guess I installed from one of the cds I downloaded.
2006-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	right, the bug I cought personally was the gpart bug when I clicked back, the gpart disengaged from the installer and appeared in a separate window :)
2006-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	overall however, its more decent then any other distro available
2006-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	you bugfix for a living?
2006-07-09T13:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	tsume	nope but i do play in launchpad/malone triage bugs and give feedback when i can

2006-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	oh.
2006-07-09T13:56:00.000Z	tsume	gnomefreak	say.. would you know of there is a technical talk channel for people who are as informed as I am on unix? Kinda like how talks go in #freebsd and #openbsd?
