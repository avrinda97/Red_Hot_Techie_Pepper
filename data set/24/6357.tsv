2006-12-01T09:24:00.000Z	r00t_		is there any nokia suite for ubuntu ?*
2006-12-01T09:24:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	you can do various things with nokia phones on ubuntu.  Some of them quite easily
2006-12-01T09:24:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	(some less so).  I don't think the nokia suite exists for linux though, no
2006-12-01T09:24:00.000Z	r00t_	osfameron	 with datacable ?
2006-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	I managed to get datacable to work fine for dialout to Nokia 6630
2006-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	having said that, none of the actual recommended tools worked :-)  I ended up copying and editing a wvdial.conf file I found on the internet
2006-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	keep it on channel unless you are going to paste anything really long
2006-12-01T09:26:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	that way if someone who *actually* knows something about this spots it they can let *me* know as well :D

2006-12-01T09:32:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	check out gnokii
2006-12-01T09:34:00.000Z	osfameron	r00t_	it's an opensource toolkit for talking to nokia phones.  Ther are also other  programs that purport to make connecting to internet via dialup phones much easier
