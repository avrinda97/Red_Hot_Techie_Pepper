2009-08-13T15:12:00.000Z	cantoma		guys, I have an eps graph figure that i need to edit (add text, arrows ...) what is the best program for doing this?
2009-08-13T15:12:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	inkscape?
2009-08-13T15:12:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	so you recommend that one?!
2009-08-13T15:13:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	it's what I use to touch up eps graphs.. that and a text editor
2009-08-13T15:14:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i just need to make some boxes and some arrows with text to explain my idea
2009-08-13T15:14:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	create from scratch? or you have an eps file you want to edit?
2009-08-13T15:14:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i generate it from octave
2009-08-13T15:14:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	or matlab (the same)
2009-08-13T15:15:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	well.. you can use octave to make boxes and arrows..
2009-08-13T15:15:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i also need to put one graph inside the other .. is for a poster
2009-08-13T15:16:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	is like in the corner of one graph it will be another which is what i want to achieve
2009-08-13T15:16:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i am shore i cannot do this with octave
2009-08-13T15:16:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	it can be done using matlab at least..
2009-08-13T15:17:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	another thing.. I just fired up inkscape just now.. seems I just get an error message when I try to open an eps file.. not really sure if I've updated someting since I used it
2009-08-13T15:18:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	must programs have that problem .. they don't open eps
2009-08-13T15:19:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	so what would you use for eps editing?
2009-08-13T15:20:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	hang on.. I'm trying to find out what I have been using
2009-08-13T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	you're just doing regular graphs from octave? you could do them in gnuplot if you want.. it seems to have a bit more features compared to octave
2009-08-13T15:23:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i could but the thing is .. can then you add one graph (inside the other)?
2009-08-13T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	yes.. gnuplot can do that
2009-08-13T15:23:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	but its just command line right?
2009-08-13T15:24:00.000Z	cantoma	Slart	i would like to have something more drag and drop
2009-08-13T15:24:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	here are samples of gnuplot diagrams.. with source code
2009-08-13T15:25:00.000Z	Slart	cantoma	well.. I don't really know of anything that does that..
