2006-04-12T08:08:00.000Z	PwcrLinux		Hello all
2006-04-12T08:08:00.000Z	PwcrLinux		Do they do have a NVU webeditor for ubuntu?
2006-04-12T08:09:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	yes - nvu is in the universe repository
2006-04-12T08:10:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	Okay is that clean and passed after they put into unverisal repos?
2006-04-12T08:11:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	clean, passed and in excellent shape (i have to say that because there are MOTU devs here :P )
2006-04-12T08:12:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	okay I'm gonna install it now
2006-04-12T08:13:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	which one nvu or nvu-dev?
2006-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	nvu.  only need nvu-dev if you need to do development work on nvu itself (as i understand it anyway)
2006-04-12T08:15:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	okay sound great and I'm doing now
2006-04-12T08:17:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	installed and it's prefect :)
2006-04-12T08:18:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	and I need to get GUI FTP program too
2006-04-12T08:18:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	nautilus (the file manager) via Places -> Connect to Server...
2006-04-12T09:11:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	u there?
2006-04-12T09:11:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	yep
2006-04-12T09:12:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	I tested on FTP via nautlis with Earthlink FTP, it's look like a "Networked" with my lappy, does it's very risky networked with my FTP provider?
2006-04-12T09:15:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	u there?
2006-04-12T09:15:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	no more or less risky than with any other ftp client,  nautilus just gives you a GUI interface, what goes across the wire will be similar to, say, using the ftp command-line tool
2006-04-12T09:16:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	okay already, I will use UNMOUNT to preventing it when not in use..
2006-04-12T09:17:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	yes, good idea, that would close the ftp connection, like exiting from the cli ftp
2006-04-12T09:18:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	yep, I used on old XP program it's does auto disconnection when it's inactives.
2006-04-12T09:19:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	ah, nautilus might do that too but i have no idea
2006-04-12T09:20:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	Yea, probably they should have inactive detection..
2006-04-12T09:21:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bimberi	I'll brb, I have to go store before they closing the doors..
2006-04-12T11:20:00.000Z	bimberi	PwcrLinux	me either :/
