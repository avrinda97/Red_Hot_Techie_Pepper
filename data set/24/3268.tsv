2008-05-03T12:27:00.000Z	Jambon		I'm having graphics issues. I have a radeon mobility 9200 which worked with gutsy but doesn't with hardy. Now my top panel won't go all the way to the right edge, and movie player won't show video unless I drag the window past that point. Also, compiz won't work. Any ideas?
2008-05-03T12:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	do you have the drivers
2008-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	which ones. ati's don't work with this card
2008-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	use envy
2008-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	sudo apt-get install envy-gtk
2008-05-03T12:33:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	so after I install them?
2008-05-03T12:34:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	open envy from the Application menu under the system tools download your driver and it works :)
2008-05-03T12:35:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	ah, thought it was in preferences or something. Thanks.
2008-05-03T12:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	:) no
2008-05-03T12:35:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	oh

2008-05-03T12:37:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	 ati mobility 9200
2008-05-03T12:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	just a min
2008-05-03T12:41:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	after the install restart X and see
2008-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	worked??
2008-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	resolution got screwed??
2008-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	ya basically
2008-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	did you have restricted drivers
2008-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	Jambon	arvind_khadri	x kinda did the whole "please pick the driver because the one you picked doesn't work" thing
2008-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	Jambon	if you had restricted drivers first remove them and re-install using envy
