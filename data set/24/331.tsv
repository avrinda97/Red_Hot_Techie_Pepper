2011-11-19T01:51:00.000Z	TK5791		how do I get myself an active password?
2011-11-19T01:52:00.000Z	TK5791		?
2011-11-19T01:53:00.000Z	TK5791		ok... so I have no password... without a password I can't create a password... what gives?
2011-11-19T01:54:00.000Z	TK5791		when I login to the user accounts... password field = none
2011-11-19T01:54:00.000Z	TK5791		don't know Root password... I'm only aware of user password
2011-11-19T01:54:00.000Z	TK5791		User Account=
2011-11-19T01:55:00.000Z	TK5791		Login Options... Password None
2011-11-19T01:55:00.000Z	TK5791		don't know what this Root Password is
2011-11-19T01:57:00.000Z	TK5791		I know... but I don't like passwords when I'm the only one using the comp
2011-11-19T01:57:00.000Z	TK5791		the original password was removed with none because I choose auto login
2011-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	even though u enabled autologin, the password you selected is still the password to sudo
2011-11-19T02:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	are you locked out, can you not run passwd and change?
2011-11-19T02:03:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	Are you trying to change the password of the user you are currently logged in as?
2011-11-19T02:07:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	what pop up, like when your trying to install something but need more privliges
2011-11-19T02:07:00.000Z	TK5791	geoffmcc	= yes
2011-11-19T02:08:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	why not just wait to do that, go to a terminal, type passwd and change your password and then do what your trying to do
2011-11-19T02:10:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	now that i think of it, the way your trying to change password isnt working probably cause the authentication box is still up
2011-11-19T02:14:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	as i suggested a few times try passwd in term
2011-11-19T02:17:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	ok now try what you were doing
2011-11-22T01:11:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	if you are having problems with chrome profile still go to /home/user/.config and delete the chromium folder and then open browser and will recreate profile
2011-11-24T02:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	i believe its in nvidia xserver settings / then go to xserver display configuration
2011-11-24T02:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	you can get to nvidaia xserver settings by going to dash and typing nvidia
2011-11-24T02:00:00.000Z	TK5791	geoffmcc	cheers dude
2011-11-24T02:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc	TK5791	no prob
