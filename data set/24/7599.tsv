2004-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	hypatia		given a default install, are there any "easy dialup" tools installed?
2004-09-20T09:24:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	pppconfig? dunno about others ...
2004-09-20T09:25:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	Computer -> System Configuration -> Networking seems to have a wizard-type thing for PPP
2004-09-20T09:25:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	Unfortunately, pppconfig isn't easy enough for me, I have no way to work out which /dev device is my modem, or even if there is a driver for it loading correctly :(
2004-09-20T09:25:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	It requires wvdial, which did not get installed :(
2004-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	mentioned it to those who can
2004-09-26T09:15:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	yep, got that
2004-09-26T09:17:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	there'll be a brief delay, some work being done on the download page so it's temporarily edit-frozen
2004-10-10T09:51:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	you might well have to patch either kernel-package or the source package in question or both
2004-10-10T10:00:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	hm, nothing evolution-ish is in the current list of uninstallable packages
2004-10-10T10:03:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	does that mean the problem isn't real?
2004-10-10T10:03:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	I don't quite understand what you're trying to tell me :)
2004-10-10T10:06:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	nah, just trying to diagnose
2004-10-10T10:09:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	a newer version of evolution was uploaded recently, give it a while to build, seems they're just out of sync
2004-10-10T10:21:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	I don't think holding evo helps
2004-10-10T10:21:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	you need to hold evolution-data-server
2004-10-10T11:17:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	no, that's deliberate
2004-10-10T11:17:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	we turned that behaviour back on for some devices, because otherwise there was no discoverable way to unmount a device
2004-10-10T11:18:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	if you can find the logs of the last technical board meeting, it was discussed there
2004-10-10T11:31:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	thanks
2005-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-*4*-k7?
2005-04-19T14:29:00.000Z	Kamion	hypatia	linux-k7 depends (indirectly) on linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-k7
2005-04-19T14:30:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	weird, perhaps something funky is going on with apt-proxy?
2005-04-19T14:32:00.000Z	hypatia	Kamion	yeah, using the archives helps. I guess I need to hack on apt-proxy at some point.
