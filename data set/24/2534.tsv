2012-05-07T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	Did you use automatic or manual partitioning? What happens when you try to boot?
2012-05-07T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	I'm a human but you haven't responded to my questions.
2012-05-07T12:26:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	I am sorry..  i certainly missed it.. looking back now
2012-05-07T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	No problem :)
2012-05-07T12:29:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	I installed Ubuntu to my firewire drive and used the entire drive.  I partitioned manually and it got through half the install and failed.  Then with out rebooting (Because I was in the Live install) I clicked on install again, and it allowed me to use all my same partition settings with out fuss.. it just said it would delete it and reuse it.. and it finished the install sucesffully the second time around.  Then i went to reboot and grub or 
2012-05-07T12:29:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	to clarify my OSX is still intact on my internal drive.. it just doesn't boot from Ubuntu on my firewire drive
2012-05-07T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	Your comment was cut off at "Then i went to reboot and grub or".
2012-05-07T12:30:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	...  Then I went to reboot and grub or lilo must not be setup right because it doesn't see my OS
2012-05-07T12:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	I know that Apple's BIOS implementation has issues with USB, it probably has issues with firewire as well. You can work around this by installing grub-efi (but booting via EFI will cause issues with linux graphics drivers) or by creating a small /boot/ partition on your internal drive.
2012-05-07T12:32:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	I installed refit but I doubt thats what your talking about
2012-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	It's not.
2012-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	By the way, in most IRC clients you can see all of your past comments, and others comments to you, with "/lastlog solarbaby" ( and usually "/lastlog clear" to get rid of the clutter /lastlog creates).
2012-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	so i'm better off installing this internally then?
2012-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	That will make things easier, yes.
2012-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	Thanks!  I setup irssi but its not working right.. even the hilight window at the top is displaying everything but hilights
2012-05-07T12:38:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	if I only installed the /boot partition on my internal drive, and the rest on the firewire drive.. might that be all your suggesting?
2012-05-07T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	That should work.
2012-05-07T12:40:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	I think I can manage that
2012-05-07T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	Make sure that grub's boot sector gets installed to the MBR of your internal drive (*not* to a partition, and not to the firewire drive).
2012-05-07T12:42:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	good tip I'm sure.
2012-05-07T12:42:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	I better get to work on backing up my 3 year old install of osx, just in case
2012-05-07T12:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	Also, do *not* use boot camp (it creates an ugly "hybrid" mbr) and be sure to make a BIOS Boot Partition (where grub's core.img will be embedded) in addition to the /boot/ partition. http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#BIOS-installation
2012-05-07T12:55:00.000Z	solarbaby	Jordan_U	will do..  Thank You
2012-05-07T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	solarbaby	You're welcome.
