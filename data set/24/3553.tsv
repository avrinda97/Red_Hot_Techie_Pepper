2011-06-27T01:17:00.000Z	cheako		http://tinyurl.com/43nv8m6  I've found some instructions that may help me.  However how can I move my old launchers from the ?old? gnome-panel?
2011-06-27T01:19:00.000Z	cheako		I'm also a bit disorientated because currently nautilus is not installable, circular dependency.
2011-06-27T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	do you have external repos or PPA's enabled
2011-06-27T01:20:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	I do or did, but now I believe it's just oneiric.
2011-06-27T01:20:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	they have probably installed packages that conflict and have created the broken dependency circle
2011-06-27T01:21:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	Sure.  Though I'm looking at the output of apt-cache policy and it looks like all the offending packages came from oneiric.
2011-06-27T01:21:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	which one ?
2011-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	it's not supported
2011-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	what additional repos did you have enabled ?
2011-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	xorg edgers and upstream wine.
2011-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	can't see them causing too much of a problem
2012-06-04T12:28:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	why do you need it to not run networking ?
2012-06-04T12:29:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	To save DHCP leases :)
2012-06-04T12:30:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	Perhaps the built in network card can't be disabled in the bios and takes down the system when used.
2012-06-04T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	why are you telling me this ?
2012-06-04T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	what are you talking about ?
2012-06-04T12:32:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	Why ask why, either you know the answer or you don't.  I've got answers to your questions.
2012-06-04T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	I don't know what question you're asking
2012-06-04T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	I was responding to stuk_gen gens question.
2012-06-04T12:33:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	I can't agree there should be a way to disable networking on boot?
2012-06-04T12:33:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	what ? I've just told him how to do it, he has the answer
2012-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	cheako	ikonia	I made that boot option up.
2012-06-04T12:34:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	I told him how to do it
2012-06-06T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	cheako	please don't do that
