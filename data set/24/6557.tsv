2006-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	depends on the computer
2006-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	its an ubuntu
2006-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	i meant the other computer
2006-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	yeh :) 2 computers with ubuntu
2006-06-25T14:45:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	well you should just have to open a gnome window and go to Network
2006-06-25T14:46:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	thats the thing, it doesnt come up :/
2006-06-25T14:46:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	well are you sharing it with Samba or--?
2006-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	NFS is the only option i have
2006-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	well is NFS what you want to use?
2006-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	basically, yeh.
2006-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	simple file swapping is all i need
2006-06-25T14:49:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	well i guess go to Places > Connect to Server then
2006-06-25T14:49:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	tried that too :?
2006-06-25T14:50:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	and does NFS show up there as an option?
2006-06-25T14:50:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	hm, perhaps try install nfs-common then?
2006-06-25T14:50:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	or you could use samba
2006-06-25T15:00:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	ok, ive got samba sharing from 1 computer, but still no sign of it from the other
2006-06-25T15:00:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	and what happens when you try connecting to it
2006-06-25T15:01:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	shows nothing
2006-06-25T15:01:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	these two computers are on the same subnet, yes?
2006-06-25T15:01:00.000Z	Toma-	eobanb	yeh
2006-06-25T15:01:00.000Z	eobanb	Toma-	can you ping one from the other
