2007-01-04T17:53:00.000Z	SeraVitae		it was just the live install that goes slow as hell.
2007-01-04T17:53:00.000Z	SeraVitae		impossibly slow.
2007-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	SeraVitae		192.
2007-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	SeraVitae		i was hoping therre'd be a command line, since i have about 4 ubuntu discs here.
2007-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	SeraVitae		that's nice
2007-01-04T17:54:00.000Z	SeraVitae		i'm not downloading another 700mb.
2007-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	SeraVitae		why can't i just run ubuntu in like, expert mode and pass an argument for like, -alternative or something
2007-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	SeraVitae		badger, badger server, something else and dapper
2007-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	SeraVitae		badger server is amd tho and won't boot on this other box.
2007-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Nup.
2007-01-04T17:55:00.000Z	coz_	SeraVitae	are you installing dapper
2007-01-04T17:56:00.000Z	SeraVitae		I don't really care what i'm installing, right now nothing will install
2007-01-04T17:56:00.000Z	coz_	SeraVitae	well the suggestion was agreat one... I always suggest the alternate cd for easy installtion with moreoptions avaiable as well
2007-01-04T17:56:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Okay, so why is it that there needs to be an alternative cd and a normal cd
2007-01-04T17:57:00.000Z	SeraVitae		when the data content i would bet is 99% the same?
2007-01-04T17:57:00.000Z	coz_	SeraVitae	the idea is for people to test ubuntu on theri machine fore 2 reason primaryly.. to see if they like it and to see if the hardware can h andle it
2007-01-04T17:58:00.000Z	SeraVitae	coz_	- i find it silly that people that can design a whole linux infrastructure can't create an argument on bootup that lets you go between two silly scripts.
2007-01-04T17:58:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Btw, i don't need xubuntu, because when i installed whatever i had on here before, i manually installed xfce anyways.
2007-01-04T17:58:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Again, i see no need in downloading 700mb just to get 10mb of difference.
2007-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	SeraVitae		there's no reason why Xu, Ku and Ubuntu couldn't be on one disk, with live and alternative/text mode install.
2007-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	coz_	SeraVitae	well think about it this way, it is a way to test the waters with the live cd, but the alternative cd is generally for more experiend linux users who demand a few more otions redily available to them
2007-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	SeraVitae		I find that hard to believe when i installed ubuntu and went 'wow this is slow' and apt-get installed xfce and modded the script and it worked straight up.
2007-01-04T06:00:00.000Z	SeraVitae		couple mb of download versus downloading a whole xubuntu iso.
2007-01-04T06:00:00.000Z	coz_	SeraVitae	adaptr is right , ubuntu is a fine but your sytem specs may have alto to do with the speed of the FULL ubuntu you may want to try edubuntu lite or ubuntulite
