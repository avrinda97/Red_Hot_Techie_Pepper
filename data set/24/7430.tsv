2008-12-14T13:18:00.000Z	unimatrix9		any ubuntu users with nvidia cards here?
2008-12-14T13:18:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	i use nvidia
2008-12-14T13:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	is that the one without a fan?
2008-12-14T13:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	big ass heat sink?
2008-12-14T13:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	well, i have a 6000 series XFX nvidia pci-express card w/out a fan, i.e. heat sink
2008-12-14T13:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	it might be the same, the pictures only show one side, i bet, do you have a pic?
2008-12-14T13:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	or a link?
2008-12-14T13:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	not the one i have, hold on, i'll find a link
2008-12-14T13:27:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	i have this: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150220&CMP=AFC-C8Junction
2008-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	unimatrix9	rdw200169	thank you
2008-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	i highly recommend xfx fanless, did you see the rating the one i have got...
2008-12-14T13:31:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	what's surprising is that i can't get another one! *sigh*
2008-12-14T13:33:00.000Z	unimatrix9	rdw200169	 once you have an card , and it breaks , its hard to find an new one that does the same job
2008-12-14T13:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	more or less i'm referring to the SLI benefit, and that requires a duplicate,
2008-12-14T13:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	regardless, you might want to consider a dual dvi out, so you can do dual monitors
2008-12-14T13:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	nvidia's drivers are *Excellent* at doing that, i know, i'm doing it now, i have one running metacity, and the other doing compiz
2008-12-14T13:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	on different X displays
2008-12-14T13:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	and i can still drag my mouse between them, even though they are independent
2008-12-14T13:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	put simply, i can watch a movie on one, and play WoW on the other
2008-12-14T13:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	with no loss in performance
2008-12-14T13:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	compiz won't run on multiple x displays, hence the metacity thing, and i don't like the 'big desktop' option
2008-12-14T13:37:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	b/c then 'full screen' always goes across both displays, and my displays are different dimensions, i.e. ones an upgrade of the other ;)
2008-12-14T13:40:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	and you still spending 55 euro, a minor upgrade to the 7000 series would add a lot of features ...
2008-12-14T13:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	unimatrix9	if i remember correctly, the 7000 series added HDPC support, among other things
