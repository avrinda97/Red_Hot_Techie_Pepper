2005-06-23T11:37:00.000Z	Frafra		hi all
2005-06-23T11:38:00.000Z	Frafra		does x work on breezy?
2005-06-23T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	yes ;)
2005-06-23T11:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	oh sorry
2005-09-01T15:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	i'd read the java page one the wiki; it tells you what to do. You can download the required debs to the usb drive and install them with 'dpkg -i'
2005-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	i think the usual place is hoary-extras
2005-11-21T11:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	'ifconfig' should tell you. maybe 'ifconfig eth0' will be more specific
2005-11-21T11:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	looks like it doesn't have an ipv4 address
2005-11-21T11:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	how familiar with networking are you? Does your network use dhcp ?
2005-11-21T11:15:00.000Z	Frafra	HappyFool	no, it doesn't
2005-11-21T11:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	what sort of network is it? home? work? school?
2005-11-21T11:16:00.000Z	Frafra	HappyFool	home
2005-11-21T11:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	ok, do you know what you want your IP address to be?
2005-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	can you please put your /etc/network/interfaces file on the pastebin too?
2005-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	Frafra	HappyFool	192.168.1.1 or similiar are good :)
2005-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	fair enough
2005-11-21T11:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	hmm. i'm not familiar with pppoe
2005-11-21T11:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	have you read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ADSLPPPoE ?
2005-11-21T11:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	you can change eth0 (your PC's ethernet interface) to be statically configured, but i don't know if that's the right thing to do with pppoe
2005-11-21T11:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	look here: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/0o8J7856.html
2005-11-21T11:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	i don't how you'll discover your modem's IP address
2005-11-21T11:27:00.000Z	Frafra	HappyFool	I must put it in my /etc/network/interfaces?
2005-11-21T11:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	yeah
2005-11-21T11:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Frafra	instead of the iface etho line there -- i think you probably ought to remove the 'preup /sbin/...' line too. Make sure you back the file up first!
