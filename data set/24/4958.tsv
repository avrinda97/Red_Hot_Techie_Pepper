2006-12-01T16:24:00.000Z	php-freak		only thing I don't like about linux is that everything seems biggers, like the text, and stuff
2006-12-01T16:25:00.000Z	php-freak		lol how can i change it similar to windows?
2006-12-01T16:25:00.000Z	php-freak		not sure
2006-12-01T16:25:00.000Z	php-freak		I think gnome
2006-12-01T16:26:00.000Z	php-freak		i see hold on
2006-12-01T16:26:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	wait.
2006-12-01T16:27:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	do NOT install kubuntu-desktop until you give it a LOT of thought
2006-12-01T16:28:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	because you will be installing an entirely different desktop manager, its associated libs, and its associated apps.
2006-12-01T16:29:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	not without effort
2006-12-01T16:30:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	you can customize GNOME to look XP-ish, or switch to KDE. but the switch is not trivial, and you should give it some thought before you do.
2006-12-01T16:30:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	but I want it to look similar to xp?
2006-12-01T16:30:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	System -> Administration -> Device Manager
2006-12-01T16:31:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	you can move the top and bottom panels, change fonts, change desktops, etc etc.
2006-12-01T16:32:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	you should not have to compile stuff very often. there are packages for almost everything.
2006-12-01T16:37:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	can you hear the login sound?
2006-12-01T16:38:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	Nope
2006-12-01T16:40:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	: What should I do to get this working?
2006-12-01T16:41:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	checked the BIOS settings?
2006-12-01T16:41:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	bios setting were fine, I just took windows out it always worked before?
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	so yea the bios are fine
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	"It worked in Windows" means nothing in Linux.
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	no, not necessarily.
2006-12-01T16:43:00.000Z	mnepton	php-freak	e.g. "Enable Plug And Play OS" in a BIOS worked fine with Windows. brought BeOS to its knees. what works for one OS in a BIOS may well not work for another.
2006-12-01T16:44:00.000Z	php-freak	mnepton	okay im going to restart, and what should I check the bios for?
