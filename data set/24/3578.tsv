2008-03-06T14:46:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	thx
2008-03-06T14:47:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	I'm happy to try to help if you don't get help in #kubuntu, but most of the people in here run ubuntu with the gnome desktop so our help may be limited to you.
2008-03-06T14:47:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	actually... that won't help me since I've set up the share on Kubuntu and I am able to see the share on ubuntu, it's just that i can't mount it in ubuntu
2008-03-06T14:48:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	so your problem is actualyl in ubuntu, then?
2008-03-06T14:48:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	yes. I am unable to download smbmount and i cant run the command smbmount since it says it's not installedf
2008-03-06T14:49:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	smbmount is if you want to actually mount it you can browse the samba share on your desktop without actually creating a mount point for it.
2008-03-06T14:51:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	ah i see. So as long as i mount it properly within fstab then it should appear and be browseable on my ubuntu client?
2008-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	nope, you don't need to mount it at all, you can browse to it from Network under the Places menu.
2008-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	At least that's my experience.
2008-03-06T14:52:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	I've tried that but all it finds is "windows network" and when i double click it nothing happends
2008-03-06T14:53:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	ok ... unfortunately I'm not a samba expert, can you browse to it from other computers?
2008-03-06T14:54:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	i found the share in terminal so I should be able to browse it, it's just that i don't know how to do it
2008-03-06T14:55:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	well, if you want to try mounting it, you can install the smbfs package.
2008-03-06T14:56:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	what do you need to type to see it from the terminal, though?
2008-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	i type: smbclient -L hostname -U%
2008-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	you type that from the ubuntu box and it sees the share?
2008-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	Yes i type it from ubuntu and it sees the share. i am unable to retrieve packages via apt-get. Think it has to do with the ps3 modificated version of ubuntu?
2008-03-06T15:00:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	unable to get packages with apt-get is a different issue, and probably one you should fix before trying to fix your samba problems.
2008-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	i know but i won't be needing it really... all i need is the filesharing to work
2008-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	ok, I would suspect that the reason you can't see the share on the desktop is because netbios isn't working on the computer that the share is on.
2008-03-06T15:03:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	I really don't know much more than that, but I think the difference is that when you issue the command on the command line you are specifying the host, so it doesn't need netbios to resolve it.
2008-03-06T15:04:00.000Z	pajamian	tzd	you may want to try #samba for more detailed help.
2008-03-06T15:04:00.000Z	tzd	pajamian	I'll do that! Thanks for your help though!
