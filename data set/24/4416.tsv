2008-03-24T07:22:00.000Z	zachwlewis		I've been trying to install cnet (a network simulator), but every time I try to run make, I get the same error: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size. What should I look for in changing the default int size to match the one on my 64-bit machine?
2008-03-24T07:22:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	it's not an error if it's a warning
2008-03-24T07:23:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	you should... consider.. installing amd64 ubuntu if you have a 64bit machine
2008-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	$ uname -a
2008-03-24T07:25:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	that's amd64. hence x86_64
2008-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	go to system > preferences > display/graphics and see what driver you're using
2008-03-24T07:35:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	system menu > administration > screens & graphics > graphics card tab, what is listed under driver
2008-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	click the menu and try to change it to nvidia, is nvidia listed?
2008-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	Should I use the "Choose driver by model" radio button?
2008-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	under "choose driver by name"
2008-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	Or, in the choose driver by name>
2008-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	yes that's the one
2008-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	ok, is it still selected under "driver" now?
2008-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	let me rephrase, does "driver" in the screens & graphics admin pane say "nvidia" now?
2008-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	After I clicked okay and closed the thing out, I reopened it and it went back to vesa.
2008-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	Before I close it, it says it right now.
2008-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	I just clicked "test" and it closed the window down. :(
2008-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	try system menu > administration > restricted drivers manager
2008-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	is there anything listed in the restricted drivers manager?
2008-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	The only one is Atheros HAL. It is enabled and in use.
2008-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	weird, nvidia should be listed.. i don't really know at this point, try googling for ubuntu nvidia driver
2008-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	or maybe someone else can help you
2008-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	zachwlewis	mackid	Okay. Thanks for all your help. :)
2008-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	mackid	zachwlewis	no problem :)
