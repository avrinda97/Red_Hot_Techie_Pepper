2004-12-15T12:13:00.000Z	britt_radiofree		seems gtkspell in general is not working ... I just switched my locale to es so maybe that has something to do with it?
2004-12-15T12:13:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	britt_radiofree	hoary? utf-8?
2004-12-15T12:15:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	Tsjoklat	yes, hoary ... but ISO-8859-1, which was what was being used for en before
2004-12-15T12:15:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	britt_radiofree	and you didn't switch to utf-8 at all?
2004-12-15T12:15:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	Tsjoklat	no, not that I'm aware of
2004-12-15T12:16:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	britt_radiofree	you could try ispell? (whatever you do don't switch to utf-8.. and yeah devs you may strangle me)
2004-12-15T12:18:00.000Z	britt_radiofree	Tsjoklat	don't most apps hardcode which spell lib they use?
