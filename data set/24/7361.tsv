2010-11-26T22:43:00.000Z	LostHorizons		hi guys - i have a macbook pro model 5,4.  I checked on the Ubuntu site and it recommended me to download Lucid Lynx but I'm not sure if i should download the desktop or the netbook edition
2010-11-26T22:45:00.000Z	wastrel	LostHorizons	the netbook edition has a GUI that's optimized for netbooks.  a normal laptop would typically use the desktop edition
2010-11-26T22:46:00.000Z	LostHorizons		thanks, wastrel :)
2010-11-26T22:48:00.000Z	LostHorizons	Bing0	i have virtualbox
2010-11-26T22:48:00.000Z	LostHorizons		i'm gonna install it through that
2010-11-26T22:48:00.000Z	LostHorizons		then, maybe, i'll use bootcamp and install it on my HD
2010-11-26T22:49:00.000Z	LostHorizons	Bing0	with that in mind why does anyone use Ubuntu as opposed to Windows, Mac OS X etc?
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	wastrel		i don't care for os x but it has better power management on macbooks than does ubuntu
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	wastrel		so i use ubuntu in a VM on my macbook
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	LostHorizons		yeah
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	wastrel		but i don't care for os x so i use it as little as possible
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	LostHorizons		I just want to fool around with it, see if I can get it working
2010-11-26T22:50:00.000Z	LostHorizons		see what the GUI is like
2010-11-26T22:52:00.000Z	LostHorizons		did you not install it properly on your machine?
2010-11-26T22:52:00.000Z	LostHorizons		i mean, partition your hard drive and install it that way?
2010-11-26T22:53:00.000Z	LostHorizons		oh
2010-11-26T22:53:00.000Z	LostHorizons		well i guess you have a point
2010-11-26T22:53:00.000Z	LostHorizons		so you just run ubuntu via virtual box?
2010-11-26T22:53:00.000Z	LostHorizons		and keep your harddrive with just OS X running on it?
2010-11-26T22:54:00.000Z	LostHorizons		a
2010-11-26T22:55:00.000Z	LostHorizons		cool
2010-11-26T22:55:00.000Z	wastrel	LostHorizons	that's what i'm doing because os x will manage the hardware better than ubuntu
2010-11-26T22:55:00.000Z	LostHorizons		i'll do that also
2010-11-26T22:55:00.000Z	wastrel	LostHorizons	i still use ubuntu for 98% of what i do in the machine
