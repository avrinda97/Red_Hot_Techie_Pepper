2007-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		sudo cp /etc/hdparm.conf /etc/hdparm.conf_backup
2007-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		gksudo gedit /etc/hdparm.conf
2007-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		then reboot
2007-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		That should enable DMA
2007-05-02T14:25:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		did you do sudo first?
2007-05-02T14:26:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		odd
2007-05-02T14:27:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		haven't had dma problems before
2007-05-02T14:27:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		except I had to enable it manually in breezy
2007-05-02T14:29:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		check and see if there's an update
2007-05-02T14:30:00.000Z	donkeyofdarkness		n2diy> try nano .bashrc
2007-05-02T14:31:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Roger that, but I want gedit to play with the file. I don't want to send newbies into nano/pico land! :)
2007-05-02T14:33:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Yes, that should work, but gedit is already open, I just want to open an other instance of it, with .bashrc.
2007-05-02T14:35:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	It isn't displayed in the open file box, i triied selecting all files, and all text files, but it isn't available/
2007-05-02T14:38:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Yes, I'm aware of hidden files and folders, and I know how to show them in Nautilus. Where do I do it in gedit?
2007-05-02T14:39:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Ah, right clicking worked, tnx.
2007-05-02T14:40:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	That should be a drop down option from view, like it is in Nautilus.
2007-05-02T14:42:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	KDE, what's that? :)
2007-05-02T14:46:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	:) Roger on that, the reason I'm trying to find .bashrc in the first place is a guy ran "rm *" on his box, and wonders why it is afu now. I won't be doing any updating.
2007-05-02T14:47:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Hey, you had a clean hard drive! :/
2007-05-02T14:49:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Ah, bare metal recovery. How much of a PITA was it?
2007-05-02T14:51:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	How do you mount a 20g back up?
2007-05-02T14:52:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	I can't back up 20g here
2007-05-02T14:53:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Ok, RAID, and hot swapping?
2007-05-02T14:57:00.000Z	n2diy	donkeyofdarkness	Roger on Samba, minimal experience with that. I'm playing with Mondo and Mindi for backing up a 10g drive now, but no joy so far. But they are a work in progress, so I should give them a try again. But, even if I get them working, I'm still looking at 15 CDs to back up a 10g drive. Reminds me of the old days backing up with floppies.
