2009-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	not on my screen it isn't.
2009-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	What does your screen say?
2009-10-17T01:16:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	That is the main partition choice
2009-10-17T01:16:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Do you mean manual?
2009-10-17T01:17:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	no... I don't mean manual. The only choices it gives me is "use the entire disk" or manual... there is no mention of the word "guided"
2009-10-17T01:18:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	It looks like this one (but this is not my screen and I am not using a virtualbox) http://i547.photobucket.com/albums/hh454/unixmen/ubuntu/16.png
2009-10-17T01:18:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Use the entire disk is half of the guided. Sometimes (If you are lucky) it will allow you to choose co-exist with another operating system. You might have to do it manually (are you keepin gwindows also?)
2009-10-17T01:19:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Do you have an operating system installed on it already?
2009-10-17T01:19:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	no the "use the entire disk" option does not allow me to be guided... it simply makes one big partition for the whole installation. I want to make a separate partition for home. I do not know enough to do manual... so I need the guided option that has been in all the previous versions but seems to be missing from jaunty.
2009-10-17T01:20:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	I will guide you through the manual option for that (you need to do it manually for a seperate /home)(=
2009-10-17T01:20:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	I have windows installed on a second drive. Having that drive plugged in or disconnected during the installation does not make any difference in whether I see a "guided" option or not. The guided option is nowhere to be found.
2009-10-17T01:21:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Okay, well, open manual and i will guide you throrgh it
2009-10-17T01:21:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	ok... my drive size is exactly 30020 megabytes, if that helps.
2009-10-17T01:22:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	So it is less than 8GB?
2009-10-17T01:22:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	30020 megabytes, not 3020 megabytes
2009-10-17T01:23:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	oooh, okay. So, are you in manual?
2009-10-17T01:24:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	the ubuntu people saw it fit to not include a chat program on the installation cd... I would have to retrieve that with synaptic.
2009-10-17T01:25:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Okay, here it goes: Open the manual partitioning in install, and select "Create New Partition" and choose Ext3 as the filesystem, set it to 8192 MB. Next, and in the mount point, choose /. Next, create another partition, Ext3 again, and have it fill the rest of the hard drive. Then as the mount point, choose /home. Check format for both. (And there is a chat program on the Install CD {Unless you have alrenative} it is pidgin IM, in internet)
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	actually, leave at least 2GB for a swap partition
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	Thanks. I will try to follow that... (by the way... I stand by my assertion that "guided" has been removed from jaunty, and no one seems to know why)
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	It practically has, because it NEVER works. I got it to work the FIRST time i installed xD
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	Eitan	cody_	oh boy... I'll need instructions for that too....
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	And your welcome
2009-10-17T01:29:00.000Z	cody_	Eitan	Haha. Just leave 2GB after making the 2nd ext3 (for /home) and create a linux-swap filesystem, put nothing in the mount point and format it as well
