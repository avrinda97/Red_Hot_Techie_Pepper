2004-11-29T06:01:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	to hoary ?
2004-11-29T06:02:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	the upgrade is easy....but do you really want it ? its in flux .... i.e. see the channel topic
2004-12-14T15:12:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	i think you first need to unload the acpi module to get the apm one to work....
2004-12-14T15:14:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	i'm not sure if: sudo rmmod acpi  could work, probably not because others depend on it
2004-12-14T15:17:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	for a test, press escape on boot and then "e"  you can edit the kernel line ....
2004-12-14T15:18:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	add the word: noacpi
2004-12-14T15:18:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	space separated behind the word "splash"
2004-12-14T15:18:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	then press b to boot.....
2004-12-14T15:24:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	now load the apm module with the command thoreauputic gave you
2004-12-14T15:26:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	hmm
2004-12-14T15:29:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	k
2004-12-14T16:09:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	did you try shutdown after enabling noacpi (without any module fiddling) ?
2004-12-14T16:09:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	didnt work ?
2004-12-14T16:20:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	try it.... the same way you added the noacpi option
2004-12-14T16:21:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	nope...thats for testing.... and you have to reboot anyway to test it ;)
2004-12-15T17:03:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	which link ?
2004-12-15T17:04:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	did you try the BIOS setting that is mentioned there ?
2004-12-15T17:13:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	there is no script, just a dead link.....
2004-12-15T17:23:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	look if the button module is loaded
2004-12-15T17:23:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	your system supports acpi....use acpi
2004-12-15T17:24:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	try: lsmod |grep button
2004-12-15T17:25:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	so: sudo modprobe button
2004-12-15T17:27:00.000Z	ogra	aaroncuk	:(
