2010-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	jsquared		Whenever I run `sudo apt-get ...`, it immediately dies. I can no longer update/install anything with Synaptic, Aptitude, or apt-get.
2010-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	jsquared		What's up with that?
2010-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	no errors?
2010-06-13T11:33:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	It just says "Reading package lists..." and then is killed (for apt-get). If I use Synaptic or Aptitude they just hang indefinitely.
2010-06-13T11:34:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	could it be bad mirrors in /etc/apt/sources.list?  I find the canadian ones suck
2010-06-13T11:36:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	what mirrors are in /etc/apt/sources.list?  pastebin this file's contents
2010-06-13T11:38:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	http://pastebin.com/kNekdC9H
2010-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	remove the us. part from all those lines so it's http://archive.ubuntu....
2010-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	Here's what I don't get: this was working literally 30 minutes ago.
2010-06-13T11:39:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	I haven't touched this file. Why would changing the sources fix anything?
2010-06-13T11:40:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	flaky mirrors maybe?  I've had similar problems, just sharing my solution
2010-06-13T11:40:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	then apt-get update after changing
2010-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	exact same results
2010-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	it makes sense if the mirror(s) you're using aren't working properly
2010-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	Is there a way to manually check?
2010-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	did you try changing the urls like i recommended?
2010-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	Yep. That's what I meant by "exact same result" earlier.
2010-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	I didn't change the "security" ones at the bottom, but they don't have us in them.
2010-06-13T11:54:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	Flannel: Well, whatever the issue was, it's apparently gone now.
2010-06-13T11:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	the old "Windows Fix" eh
2010-06-13T11:56:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	i haven't used it as thoroughly as the last version, but haven't had any issues, everything "just worked" with this version
2010-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	I've tweaked the hell out of gnome so it just grabbed all my settings and I don't really see the UI changes.
2010-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	jsquared	codebrainz	I assume you're talking about things like the window buttons being on the left, etc.
2010-06-13T11:57:00.000Z	codebrainz	jsquared	yeah mostly.  luckily it's easy to change such things
