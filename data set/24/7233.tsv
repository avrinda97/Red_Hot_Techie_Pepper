2005-08-09T08:15:00.000Z	Code_Dark		oh, and i like the default gnome; i dont think i'll use fluxbox as planned. i like how all the tools are just... well, there.
2005-08-09T08:15:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	I like using xfce4.  Haven't used gnome much.
2005-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	I was a KDE user, but now I'm using xfce4.  Haven't used Gnome much.
2005-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	I used xfce when I had slackware on my laptop
2005-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	I began using xfce4 some weeks ago when I installed Ubuntu.  Only had 64MB of RAM at the time, so it was suggested I try using it.
2005-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	Yeah, it's awesome for lightweight stuff.
2005-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Now that I have 256MB of RAM, I don't know that I want to go to Gnome.  I used Audacity alot, and doesn't Gnome eat alot of RAM?  I'd rather save it for Audacity.
2005-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	I'm honestly not sure; the only time I've really used it is with the ubuntu livecd 5 minutes ago. I know that I have ~128mb ram, and it's running pretty smoothly for me (and that's booting from cd, too)
2005-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Hmmm...maybe I'll try it sometime.
2005-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	couldn't hurt; if it's too bulky, just uninstall :p
2005-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	I'll probably try Gnome once I have a larger HD.  I have a 2GB HD that keeps pretty full, and I don't have Gnome installed right now.  (Just ubuntu-base but not ubuntu-desktop)
2005-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	ah, right.
2005-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	See what I mean?
2005-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	yeah.
2005-08-09T08:23:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Right at this moment I have about 425MB free, and most of that will soon be filled with the audio files I'll be editing.  Then I'll remove them again, and begin my next editing project.  Don't really want to fill that space with Gnome.
2005-08-09T08:24:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	(and anyone else who wants to add) If there are any, what are the advantages to using Gnome rather than xfce4?
2005-08-09T08:25:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	I'm definitely no Gnome expert, but from my experience it a.) looks really nice and b.) has a lot of useful tools easily accessed (not that xfce doesn't), especially, for me, wireless tools.
2005-08-09T08:26:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Everything is accessible in xcfe4, right?
2005-08-09T08:27:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	I believe so, but I'm not sure if there are Gnome-interface-specific tools. I doubt it, but it's possible
2005-08-09T08:27:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Oh, that's right.  Some gnome stuff works in xfce4, but probably not all of them, I would guess.
2005-08-09T08:28:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	Fortunately, there aren't any Gnome apps I absolutely need at this time.
2005-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Harold	Code_Dark	I'll chat with you some other time; going to work on something else now...later!
2005-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	I need the wireless stuff, which I'm not sure if it's gnome-portable
2005-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Code_Dark	Harold	later :)
