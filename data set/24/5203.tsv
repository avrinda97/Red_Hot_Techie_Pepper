2007-06-27T12:08:00.000Z	mcquaid		i only recently upgraded to fiesty. previously, i had two ubuntu boxes (one dapper, one edgy) using samba to share files
2007-06-27T12:08:00.000Z	mcquaid		i since upgraded the edgy box and now samba only works one way
2007-06-27T12:08:00.000Z	mcquaid		the feisty box can read the dapper box but not the other way around
2007-06-27T12:09:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	error messages are something awesome
2007-06-27T12:10:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	smbclient -L <ip of other machine>
2007-06-27T12:14:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	one thing I notice from that is the workgroups are different
2007-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	that usually does it the way you use ti
2007-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and restart samba
2007-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	connection by IP of course still works
2007-06-27T12:21:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	i changed both smb.confs to workgroup but one is still reporting HOME when doing smbclient -L
2007-06-27T12:21:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	I said "and restart samba"
2007-06-27T12:22:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	yes restarted samba on both
2007-06-27T12:23:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	how exactly?
2007-06-27T12:23:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	/etc/init.d/samba restart
2007-06-27T12:36:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	it's weird it's still reporting home instead of workgroup.  /etc/init.d/samba restart should be sufficient, correct?
2007-06-27T12:37:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	did you do it as root?
2007-06-27T12:37:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	then it does
2007-06-27T13:22:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	/etc/passwd
2007-06-27T13:28:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	plz look at http://www.pastebin.ca/592433.  Can't figure out where the HOME valube is being set.
2007-06-27T13:59:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2007-06-27T14:00:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	I don't think so, I don't have 'HOME' in either smb.conf yet smbclient lists one as HOME
2007-06-27T14:10:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	on all machines running samba
2007-06-27T14:15:00.000Z	wols	mcquaid	sudo grep -i workgroup /etc/samba/smb.conf
2007-06-27T14:20:00.000Z	mcquaid	wols	both boxes report workgroup = WORKGROUP but I know I have that in both already
