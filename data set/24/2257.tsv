2009-02-28T02:33:00.000Z	SuperMoos		My DVDs are "faint" sounding, I'm playing them in ogle , and VLC.  Yet, none of them make the walls rattle.
2009-02-28T02:34:00.000Z	SuperMoos		Is there something I can do about that ?
2009-02-28T02:34:00.000Z	SuperMoos		When I play a common mp4, wmv, etc, it's as loud as it should be
2009-02-28T02:34:00.000Z	SuperMoos		Just the DVDs are faint
