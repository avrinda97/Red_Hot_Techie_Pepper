2012-03-13T20:45:00.000Z	louder		hi everybody
2012-03-13T20:46:00.000Z	louder		is there a way to set a wider screen resolution?? currently the appearance settings only offers 1024x600
2012-03-13T20:48:00.000Z	luxius	louder	should be possible to set up a resolution that both gfx card and monitor supports.
2012-03-13T20:48:00.000Z	luxius	louder	so I am guessing either your monitor or gfx driver isn't up to date?
2012-03-13T20:48:00.000Z	louder	luxius	how can i check the gfx driver
2012-03-13T20:50:00.000Z	luxius	louder	in a terminal (CLI) try 'lshw' (list hardware)
2012-03-13T20:53:00.000Z	luxius	louder	lspci does "list pci", so no =)
2012-03-13T20:57:00.000Z	louder	luxius	under category display, using lshw the device product is Mobile 945GSE Express Integrated Graphics Controller
2012-03-13T20:58:00.000Z	luxius	louder	it should tell you which driver it uses
2012-03-13T20:58:00.000Z	luxius	louder	from there you go forum hunting for more info, which driver should you use, etc =)
2012-03-13T21:01:00.000Z	louder	luxius	found the driver, but i guess if the card is compatible the propietary driver should be on the official repos, therefore the device will be upgraded automatically??
2012-03-13T21:03:00.000Z	louder	luxius	driver=i915
2012-03-13T21:03:00.000Z	luxius	louder	sorry, I don't know anything about on-board gfx chips, and less about intel gfx xD
2012-03-13T21:05:00.000Z	luxius	louder	graphics
2012-03-13T21:06:00.000Z	luxius	louder	yes
2012-03-13T21:07:00.000Z	luxius	louder	I just don't know which you should use. In my case it's Radeon 300 (9500 Pro), and it has a FREE linux driver installed. I can install the ATI driver on top, if I sign the copyright agreement, to get more juice out of the card. As is I don't need wild 3D, so I don't care.
2012-03-13T21:08:00.000Z	louder	luxius	the issue is that im currently using a different screen resolution than the native one (1024x600) and can only use 4/5 parts of the screen with the mouse
2012-03-13T21:08:00.000Z	luxius	louder	and you can't change it in display settings in the control panel?
2012-03-13T21:09:00.000Z	louder	luxius	i changed it using a program - jupiter. 10.1 inches screen, it really widens the space with 1024x768
2012-03-13T21:10:00.000Z	luxius	louder	sorry, I don't know. Hope you find a fix, though =)
2012-03-13T21:11:00.000Z	louder	luxius	thanx anyway
2012-03-13T21:15:00.000Z	louder	luxius	is there a site where linux drivers are listed for different devices?? remember found one for wifi cards, but dont know about graphics
