2005-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	dud		i just disabled all kde sound events
2005-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	dud		no kde apps either?
2005-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	dud		like k3b or similar
2005-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	dud		okies, guess thats not it then
2005-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	dud		but if the ubuntu system sounds works, its a good chance that ESD is working
2005-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	dud		most sound players use oss or alsa, but gnome uses esd
2005-01-17T13:20:00.000Z	dud		i dont know how you'd go about changing which sound dmons your apps will use...
2005-01-17T13:21:00.000Z	dud		google around for it
2005-01-17T13:22:00.000Z	dud		also try 'sudo lshw' Ensiferum
2005-01-17T13:22:00.000Z	dud		see if it sees your cdroms
2005-01-17T13:23:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	that's a great command!
2005-01-17T13:40:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	lshw doesnt show the cdroms.
2005-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	pio?
2005-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	dud	Ensiferum	the drive is running udma2 mode
2005-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	mkay
2005-01-19T10:27:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	seems like a kernel/driver problem
2005-01-19T10:28:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	unlikely
2005-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	i'm sure you can burn faster on windows
2005-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	those are not problem per se, unless they conflict with something
2005-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	dud	Ensiferum	should i do a make config on the kernel?
2005-01-19T10:30:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	are you good at building kernels?
2005-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	dud	Ensiferum	ive ran *nix for quite a few years now
2005-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	up to you. i wouldnt try. i have had enough of dicking around with building kernels
2005-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	Ensiferum	dud	for scsi emulation you need to have scsi support in kernel
