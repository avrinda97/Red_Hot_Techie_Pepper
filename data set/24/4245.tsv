2007-05-29T15:52:00.000Z	shiester_miester		whats with that
2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	shiester_miester		foiled once again!
2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	shiester_miester		well, some of us are
2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	shiester_miester		see?
2007-05-29T15:54:00.000Z	shiester_miester		or are they completely gone altogether
2007-05-29T15:55:00.000Z	shiester_miester		so you just cant see them within ubuntu?
2007-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	shiester_miester		anybody had any experience with debugging sound in ubuntu?  my sound doesnt work when I boot initially, but then when I restart its fine.  its annoying as hell
2007-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	shiester_miester		uhh...im using whatever starts up :/  its working at the moment, how can I find out?
2007-05-29T15:58:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	check in System->Prefs->sound if ESD is selected
2007-05-29T15:59:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	if possible, i recommend not using ESD at all. then again, i dont use gnome, except when in ubuntu. i am a regular #alsa member.
2007-05-29T16:01:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	sure. download and run my alsa-info script, which will give me the info i need to fix the issue. i am however about to head home (takes me about 30-40 minutes to get there)
2007-05-29T16:02:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	if possible, will you be around then? in the meantime, try asking some of the others in #alsa. one of the ubuntu alsa packagers hangs in there too
2007-05-29T16:03:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	ESD is a sound server, that blocks the sound card.. most apps have an ALSA output aswell, are you are better off using that. and letting ALSA handle the software stream mixing itself.
2007-05-29T16:05:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	yes. in most instances, when ESD is in use, non-ESD apps will fail to use it.
2007-05-29T16:05:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	if you set ALSA as the output, and untick the ESD box, then ESD isnt the issue.
2007-05-29T16:06:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	ill give you a script to run, which will generate info that the #alsa people will want, to help solve your issue
2007-05-29T16:06:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	http://www.wishie.net/alsa/index.php?task=support
2007-05-29T16:07:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	run it now. bookmark the URL
2007-05-29T16:13:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	chmod a+x alsa-info.sh, then ./alsa-info.sh
2007-05-29T16:17:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	DELL pc ?
2007-05-29T16:18:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	it doesnt. but you have an EMU10K1X
2007-05-29T16:23:00.000Z	wishie[out] 	shiester_miester	you managed to get the ubuntu sound dev by chance too!
