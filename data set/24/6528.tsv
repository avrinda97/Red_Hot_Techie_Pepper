2006-01-19T13:35:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	i had same problem with the live cd as i have with suse 10.0, on line with no communication
2006-01-19T13:36:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	I see... do you know how to mount your drive?
2006-01-19T13:37:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	aaah i can't say as i do
2006-01-19T13:38:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	ok I am going to give you instructions, one sec
2006-01-19T13:38:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	i can do a screenshot
2006-01-19T13:47:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7154
2006-01-19T13:48:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	do that after booting the livecd
2006-01-19T13:49:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	in the browser?
2006-01-19T13:50:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	that is my terminal.  You would do those commands in your terminal on the livecd
2006-01-19T13:51:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	so that will remote you to me
2006-01-19T13:52:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	no, you aren't understanding.  Those are just commands.  for example 'sudo fdisk -l' is the first command that you will type.  The stuff after '#' are just comments that I am giving you
2006-01-19T13:53:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	ok continue
2006-01-19T13:54:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	that's it.  just boot the live cd and do what that pastebin tells you
2006-01-19T13:55:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	ok i'll try it
2006-01-20T06:50:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	unable to mount drive, said file not found. I erased master and installed ubuntu also on master drive and that one would communicte with web and i have cable. this ubuntu says that its alwys online
2006-01-20T06:50:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	okay so you are good to go?
2006-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	woops it wouldn't communicate
2006-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	so fresh new install and no internet, that is the problem you are having?
2006-01-20T06:52:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	yes only this one will communicate
2006-01-20T06:52:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	I don't really nknow too much about troubleshooting that, someone else can probably help you out
2006-01-20T06:54:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	i may need to erase both drives and start over, cause only one install will work online
2006-01-20T06:54:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	that sounds a bit drastic.  Just explain everything again in detail but concisely and ask the channel.
2006-01-20T07:12:00.000Z	chuck	_jason	thanks for everything you did to help!
2006-01-20T07:12:00.000Z	_jason	chuck	yw
