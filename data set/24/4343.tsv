2007-05-12T07:21:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	if you do open with other app then select vlc, it will show up in the menu next time
2007-05-12T07:22:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	if you want to make it default for files, right-click > properties, then open with tab ... default for dvds, sys >prefs > removable media

2007-05-12T07:55:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	what's been the problem?
2007-05-12T07:56:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	not sure, it will not load, cant find the default skin to load, I checked and its there
2007-05-12T07:56:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	main interface error: no suitable access module for `/home/tbuss/.vlc/skins2/default.vlt'
2007-05-12T07:57:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	is that from an error dialog or terminal output?
2007-05-12T07:58:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	terminal
2007-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	installed via apt?
2007-05-12T08:01:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	yes, I also received this terminal output: no suitable access module for `/home/tbuss/.vlc/skins2/default.vlt'
2007-05-12T08:02:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	try running with this option: vlc -I skins2
2007-05-12T08:04:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	doesn't work, loads into the panel but never displays
2007-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	probably an ubuntu bug, but have you tried the vlc support options? http://www.videolan.org/support/index.html
2007-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	at least to see what they have to say?
2007-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	okay, thanks, it was working great up until today
2007-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	?? so it broke recently?
2007-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	is there a way I can config so that it doesnt look for skins2?
2007-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	it broke today
2007-05-12T08:07:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	i thought you were trying to fix it for two weeks?  -- i don't think you can steer clear of it looking for skins, but i'm no expert on the app
2007-05-12T08:09:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	I've installed, purged and removed several times, it has not worked consistently since I installed.  Sorry about the confusion, its seem like everytime I install and run, something new comes up
2007-05-12T08:09:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	bah, forgot that was just your attention grabber. :P
2007-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	I'm looking at the link right now, I'll see what kind of damage I can do :} I appreciate your help
2007-05-12T08:11:00.000Z	orbin	cholera	good luck.
2007-05-12T08:14:00.000Z	cholera	orbin	used vlc -I winamp2 it at least displays so I can make changes
