2005-12-19T16:45:00.000Z	jdeange2		er, oops
2005-12-19T16:46:00.000Z	jdeange2		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5748 <-- this is the problem I'm having with xorg.
2005-12-19T16:46:00.000Z	jdeange2		(after upgrading dapper and installing wacom-tools)
2005-12-19T16:47:00.000Z	jdeange2		it might not even be a dapper problem.
2005-12-19T16:48:00.000Z	jdeange2		it looks like something stupid happened with respect to something changing stuff on my xorg to support the tablet device in my convertible laptop
2005-12-19T16:48:00.000Z	jdeange2		or at least that's what I surmise
2005-12-19T16:48:00.000Z	jdeange2		new input device, makes all the other input devices go wonky.
2005-12-19T16:49:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	the xorg config is the same syntax as xf86config?
2005-12-19T16:51:00.000Z	jdeange2	M_Cheevy	AFAIK, which isn't very well.
2005-12-19T16:52:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	basically, the input devices section is pretty easy to suss out, the server section is where the devices are activated
2005-12-19T16:52:00.000Z	jdeange2	M_Cheevy	it claims that there are no such drivers as "kbd" and "mouse."
2005-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	okay... I see the two pointer devices..., the keyboard area looks okay....
2005-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	ah.. kpd is missing from the modules list... just need to edit the file and toss it in there...
2005-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	also, you know you're only running in 16 bit mode?
2005-12-19T16:56:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	also, it looks like you're not using the nvidia binary driver...
2005-12-19T16:57:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	like I said, just edit the modules section to re-add kdm to the list.. your keyboard input device is setup correctly...
2005-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	jdeange2	M_Cheevy	I just did that and nothing changed.
2005-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	did you restart X?
2005-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	okay, back up your existing config. do a apt-reconfigure on the package
2005-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	then re-add the lines for your touchpad
2005-12-19T17:01:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	I'm an old X head, I always aim to edit the file first...
2005-12-19T17:16:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	get's the sys admin's  attention and the account get's nuked ;)
2005-12-19T17:32:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	jdeange2	still goofin on the keyboard is it?
