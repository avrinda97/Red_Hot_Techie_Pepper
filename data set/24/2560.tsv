2008-11-07T02:39:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	Why do you need 5.2.6?
2008-11-07T02:41:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	lastest stable version, has got LOTS of bugfixes and json functions ...
2008-11-07T02:41:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	Will 5.2.4 work (plus buxgfixes?)
2008-11-07T02:42:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	yes, 5.2 would work ...
2008-11-07T02:42:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	plus I'm wondering how to install pecl on ububtu ... it is part of PHP ...
2008-11-07T02:42:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	Yeah, I see it in the changelong.  5.2.4 is available in Hardy, if you are willing to upgrade to the next LTS.  (You can upgrade from 6.06 straight to 8.04)
2008-11-07T02:43:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	I'm a slackware user ... I don't know much about ubuntu ... and I don't have physical access to the machine in question ... so I'm not very fond of doing a dist upgrade ...
2008-11-07T02:44:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	cause if something goes wrong ... I have no way to fix it by inserting a CD ...
2008-11-07T02:46:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	The only PHP version available for dapper is 5.1.2, which has all of the security updates, but you can't use JSON without the php5-json package
2008-11-07T02:47:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	not available in that version :/
2008-11-07T02:47:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	What?  php5-json is available
2008-11-07T02:47:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/php5-json
2008-11-07T02:48:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	# apt-get install php5-json Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree... Done E: Couldn't find package php5-json
2008-11-07T02:49:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	It's in universe, you must not have universe enabled
2008-11-07T02:49:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	how? ^^
2008-11-07T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	edit your sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list) and uncomment the universe lines
2008-11-07T02:50:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	thank you :) I'll try ^^
2008-11-07T02:54:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	uhm ... I'm surpried once again ... what dependency exaclty would php have on git? :O
2008-11-07T02:54:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	or vim ...
2008-11-07T02:58:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	It shouldn't.
2008-11-07T02:59:00.000Z	Flannel	feindbild	And it doesn't, as far as I can see.
2008-11-07T02:59:00.000Z	feindbild	Flannel	well ... thats what the grat ubuntu upgraded when I user: apt-get update; apt-get upgrade php5
