2011-07-14T23:07:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	first of all: which driver and which gaphic card are you suing?
2011-07-14T23:07:00.000Z	Incarus6		*using
2011-07-14T23:07:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	how can i check please?
2011-07-14T23:08:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	can you paste the whole "/var/log/Xorg.0.log" file?
2011-07-14T23:09:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	sure, here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/644304/
2011-07-14T23:11:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	you have to start nvidia-settings and set the screen size there. Dont just click apply, also use the option "save to X Configuration File". I recommend you to use "gksu nvidia-settings". you have to reboot after you did that
2011-07-14T23:12:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	i have to change resolution in section Display -> panning? and i write 1680x1050 right?
2011-07-14T23:13:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	I think so ;)
2011-07-14T23:14:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	I written 1680x1050 but I received a message: layout has some inconsistencies, â€¢ MetaMode 11 of Screen 0 is the same as MetaMode 1.  All MetaModes must be unique.
2011-07-14T23:15:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	try to delete all unecessary metamodes under "X Screen" in nvidia-settings
2011-07-14T23:20:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	no changes yet I deleted modes but still not have 1680x1050
2011-07-14T23:22:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	have you saved the configuration to that x-file thing and have you rebooted since then?
2011-07-14T23:22:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	I reboot now try
2011-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	Incarus6		I feel stupid with my standard mouse and keyboard. Maybe I should connect the cell phone with the computer and write with the cellphone keyboard, Dr_Willis, that would be even more nerdy ;)
2011-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	fixed?
2011-07-14T23:26:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	I reboot now I have to use mouse to see the whole desktop resolution
2011-07-14T23:26:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	font are the same as 1024x768
2011-07-14T23:27:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	so the picture is scrolling when you move the mouse the the screencorners?
2011-07-14T23:27:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	yes i have to scrolling right, left, up down...
2011-07-14T23:28:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	are you sure that your screen is supporting that resolution?
2011-07-14T23:28:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	yes In my win7 i'm using 1680x1050
2011-07-14T23:33:00.000Z	ubuntu1680	Incarus6	may I have post another logs?
2011-07-14T23:34:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	I have no Idea if I can help you with that issue, you could try the gtf command, exempli gratia by typing "gtf 1680 1050 60" that will return a possible modeline
2011-07-14T23:37:00.000Z	Incarus6	ubuntu1680	but Im running out of time, sorry that I couldn't help you. You could ask again in the channel. Panning seems to be the wrong option that is when your virtual screen size is bigger then your physical screen size, so the best way to configure your screen size would be if you edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Dynamically_testing_different_resolutions for more information
