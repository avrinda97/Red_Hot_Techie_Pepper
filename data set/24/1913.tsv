2009-06-24T18:24:00.000Z	motoh		I'm having trouble reaching my wireless gateway, even though I'm connected to the access point. Can anyone help me troubleshoot?
2009-06-24T18:25:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	do you have an IP?
2009-06-24T18:27:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	how do you get your IP?
2009-06-24T18:28:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	yes, I can ping it wired, or wirelessly on my Vista install.
2009-06-24T18:31:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	the problem is only a linux issue?
2009-06-24T18:32:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	when wired, are you able to ping the gateway?
2009-06-24T18:32:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	I am using wicd, and the intellinux drivers.
2009-06-24T18:32:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	yes
2009-06-24T18:35:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	you use wicd. get an automatic IP via DHCP. You have checked that the IP is normal such as 192.168.x.x and that the subnet is normal such as 255.255.255.0?
2009-06-24T18:36:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	Yes, the IP and subnet are correct.
2009-06-24T18:37:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	sounds like a problem with the drivers or getting the wireless powered up.  I lean towards the drivers.
2009-06-24T18:40:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	with my old laptop. I manually setup using iwconfig and wpaconfig.
2009-06-24T18:41:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	How do I do that, and I also don't seem to have a wpaconfig command.
2009-06-24T18:42:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	I'm sorry, it is wpa_supplicant.  wpaconfig was the name of the file I created for it to use.
2009-06-24T18:42:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	that is only needed when you have your wireless using WPA/WPA2.  which it shoud.
2009-06-24T18:43:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	So ow do I configure these manually?
2009-06-24T18:44:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	wpa_supplicant takes some patience.  the iwconfig is painless.
2009-06-24T18:44:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	I've got a lovely morning sun and a cup of tea.  Bring the ruckus.
2009-06-24T18:48:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	start by looking at man iwconfig
2009-06-24T18:49:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	I'll come back to you in a few.
2009-06-24T19:36:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	how are you coming along?
2009-06-24T19:37:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	All set.  I found a bug report that had a module fix for one of my modules that cleaned it right up.
2009-06-24T19:37:00.000Z	motoh	anewbis	Now I'm tinkering with my microphone, webcam and SD ontroller.
2009-06-24T19:37:00.000Z	anewbis	motoh	Cool.
