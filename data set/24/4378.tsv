2007-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	stefg	wburge_	take fluxbuntu
2007-04-26T10:24:00.000Z	wburge_	stefg	 thanks, how much can it run on?
2007-04-26T10:25:00.000Z	stefg	wburge_	64 MB might be the minimum... it's not only a question of the window-manager... kernels get big today and a lot of services get started. Rather look for some distro specifically tailored for low-mem systems
2007-04-26T10:26:00.000Z	wburge_	stefg	k will do, ive experimented with damn smal in the past but wanted more features, they disable alot of stuff and also remove almost all aps to make it so small
2007-04-26T10:26:00.000Z	wburge_	stefg	was hoping for something slightly more powerful and more ubuntu like
2007-04-26T10:27:00.000Z	stefg	wburge_	try fluxbuntu
2007-04-26T10:27:00.000Z	wburge_	stefg	im dling it now thanks for the suggestion
2007-04-26T10:28:00.000Z	stefg	wburge_	I'd use slckware and a 2.4 kernel on a machine like that :-)
