2009-06-23T21:24:00.000Z	pronoy		is there a torrent client which has a notification icon that sits in the notification area and enables you to close the window of the client ?
2009-06-23T21:24:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	they pretty much all do that
2009-06-23T21:24:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	not transmission
2009-06-23T21:24:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	I use transmission and it does that
2009-06-23T21:25:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	what ? how? by default ?
2009-06-23T21:25:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	well, not by default. after the window comes up and you select "ok" you can shrink the main window
2009-06-23T21:29:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	when I select a torrent I want to download, and then click 'ok' when I am asked if I want to use transmission and I say ok, a window opens so I can see what files are included in the torrent, then I select 'ok' if I want to d/l them or cancel if not.
2009-06-23T21:30:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	actually i have the torrents on my desktop...so
2009-06-23T21:30:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	then there's a box showing me what torrents are being d/l or u/l if I'm seeding... and you can shrink that.
2009-06-23T21:31:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	you mean the small torrent files that you use to start the d/l, right?
2009-06-23T21:31:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	yeah
2009-06-23T21:31:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	ok, so what do you do to start a download then?
2009-06-23T21:32:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	just open transmission and click the plus button and add the torrent for download
2009-06-23T21:32:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	thats standard i guess
2009-06-23T21:33:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	well, you can start the download automatically when you're at the torrent site but that's ok
2009-06-23T21:33:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	it's the same process really
2009-06-23T21:33:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	never mind i think it won't hurt if it sits around anyways..i'll chose a different desktop...enough of asthetics
2009-06-23T21:33:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	so when you click + to add the files to download then you have another window listing the download, how many peers are connected, etc?
2009-06-23T21:34:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	ok man. but it's easy to shrink that window.......
2009-06-23T21:36:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	i downloaded deluge-torrent...i got that notification...... thanks for your time
2009-06-24T20:18:00.000Z	pronoy	gmachine_24	use apt-get remove <package name>
2009-06-24T20:19:00.000Z	gmachine_24	pronoy	the remove command doesn't do it. But thanks.
