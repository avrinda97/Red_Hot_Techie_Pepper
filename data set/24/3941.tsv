2009-11-03T19:04:00.000Z	TheSaint		I need help with postgres installation on Ubuntu 9.04 server. My requirement is that postgres should be installed in /home/postgres directory.
2009-11-03T19:04:00.000Z	TheSaint		How do I do that?
2009-11-03T19:05:00.000Z	TheSaint		Thanks Barbapapa. I thought that would be the only way.
2009-11-03T19:05:00.000Z	TheSaint		still good to get a confirmation from the experts.
2009-11-03T19:06:00.000Z	TheSaint		lot of negative press on Ubuntu 9.10 upgrade.
2009-11-03T19:06:00.000Z	TheSaint		Is it really bad? I am holding back my upgrade.
2009-11-03T19:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	 yes  what woble said
2009-11-03T19:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	and for me,  but  i'll clean install Karmic on here,  I been testing since alpha 4.   the other uhmm not sure if it's going 9.10 yet or not,  untill I have tried the final.
2009-11-03T19:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	no
2009-11-03T19:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	not at all
2009-11-03T19:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	a new version of Ubuntu comes out in  April and October  (except for  2006, when  the April version got delayed to June, but that was also the first Long Term Support release)
2009-11-03T19:14:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	Thanks. Maybe it was just a coincidence that this happened immediately after Win7 went public
2009-11-03T19:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	not a coincidence at all,  it was planned years ago
2009-11-03T19:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	to have a release at the end of October 2009
2009-11-03T19:15:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	Thanks. Good to know that.
2009-11-03T19:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	propritary software such as Windows come out with a new version every three years or so,   Ubuntu April and October, the other popular distros  get  one or two releases a year as well
2009-11-03T19:16:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	That is why I like Ubuntu. I switched to Ubuntu from version 7
2009-11-03T19:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	Mac OS X  as well in my example.   You went from Windows 7 (Vista version 2) to Ubuntu?
2009-11-03T19:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	hopefuly 10.04 will be able to compete a  bit more properly against Windows 7, thing is, becasue of  lack of commercial software and hardware vender support,   Ubuntu and other Linux distros can't do this fully yet.
2009-11-03T19:18:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	when is 10.04 going to be out?
2009-11-03T19:19:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	By that time Windows 7 would be on SP1 at least.
2009-11-03T19:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	then around the time  XP  runs out of support on the  consumer/homeuser desktop in 2014,   Ubuntu  14.04  should be coming out :)  which will be an LTS according to how releases are done.  Maybe Wine will be able to run most XP programs by then as well and well :)
2009-11-03T19:21:00.000Z	TheSaint	sebsebseb	They say the world will end on Dec 2012. So, maybe ubuntu 14.04 may never come out.
2009-11-03T19:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheSaint	the world will end then what?  ,but maybe  things will have gotton rather flooded,  because of global warming and ice caps melting,   this has gone a bit off topic now by the way
