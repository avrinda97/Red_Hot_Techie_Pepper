2006-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Been a long time since I dabbled in Linux, but as far as Ubuntu it's come a long way.
2006-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Well...not really a long time lol..like 5 months XD
2006-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Eh..my scroll lock won't turn on
2006-11-14T12:29:00.000Z	luminousnerd		...wtf
2006-11-14T12:30:00.000Z	luminousnerd		I need scroll lock!
2006-11-14T12:31:00.000Z	luminousnerd		It controls my Keyboard's LEDs!! :(
2006-11-14T12:33:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Alright, can I get some help here?  My Internet doesn't seem to be working properly.  I can pull up some pages, but others that work fine here on my Mac don't work at all in Ubuntu
2006-11-14T12:34:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Namely, gnome-look.org
2006-11-14T12:36:00.000Z	luminousnerd		:(
2006-11-14T12:37:00.000Z	luminousnerd		Does Ubuntu not open RAR by default?
2006-11-14T12:38:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	you need a package, it's unrar-free, or something like that, do aptitude search unrar
2006-11-14T12:43:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Jewfro-Macabbi	no idea...was never presented with such an option
2006-11-14T12:43:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	you'll need to do that, go to system, administration, software properties, then check all the boxes....
2006-11-14T12:51:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	graphically did you try right clicking the file, extract here?
2006-11-14T12:51:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Jewfro-Macabbi	yes I did
2006-11-14T12:52:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	yeah, it worked for me also, I have Ark also: sudo aptitude install ark
2006-11-14T12:53:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	once you get used to it, it's quite nice
2006-11-14T12:53:00.000Z	luminousnerd	Jewfro-Macabbi	I'm sure it is :) but I'm not used to it yet lol
2006-11-14T12:53:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	look under applications, accessories, you may already have ark
2006-11-14T12:54:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	exactly...
2006-11-14T12:55:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	yes, it install dependencies, as you see, for you
2006-11-14T12:57:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	I'm looking now for an answer, googling......
2006-11-14T12:57:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	or try nothlit's suggestion
2006-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	luminousnerd	echo PATH=$PATH:/path/to/unrar
