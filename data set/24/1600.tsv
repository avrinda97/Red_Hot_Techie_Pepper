2009-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	Xubuntus		How does the soundrecognition actually work in Ubuntu, compared to Xubuntu?
2009-11-11T06:02:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i would think that sound recognition would be the same in xubuntu and ubuntu
2009-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	EXACTLY what I thought, and why I also installed Xubuntu.
2009-11-11T06:04:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	are the versions the same for ubuntu and xubuntu?
2009-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	for example, are you comparing 9.04 to 9.04?
2009-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	YES, 9.10 and 9.10. Karmic and Karmic.
2009-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	Working and not working. ?!?!?!
2009-11-11T06:07:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i think you can install fluxbox on ubuntu, maybe that is the easiest solution
2009-11-11T06:07:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	What?
2009-11-11T06:07:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	How does Fluxbox help me copy the audio-config?
2009-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	I'm making an assumption that flux is what xubuntu uses, so i was recommeding installing ubuntu on the system with xubuntu, then install flux, if you're trying to learn how audio is configured, then that's another story.
2009-11-11T06:10:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i'm under the impression that pulseaudio is necessary for audio to work out of the box.  you can pgrep pulseaudio on the xubuntu system to see if it's even running.
2009-11-11T06:12:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i installed xfce on this system, liked it, but there were deal breakers
2009-11-11T06:13:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	What dealbreakers?
2009-11-11T06:14:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	hmmm, need time to recall.  i still have it just in case i need it though
2009-11-11T06:15:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i'm pretty sure colors were an issue.  couldn't get it with the black background, i prefer this color scheme.  also mouse config, my mouse buttons are switched.  oh, more importantly, couldn't organize open apps on the panel
2009-11-11T06:15:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	None of those are problems in my Xubuntu-install.
2009-11-11T06:16:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	interesting.  i should install in a virtual machine.  maybe after i install zenix in a virtual machine
2009-11-11T06:19:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	that means pulseaudio is running and its pid is 3330
2009-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	Is pulseaudio included in ALSA?
2009-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i know on my system, which uses snd_hda_intel "driver" i need the snd_hda_intel module and pulseaudio for it to work
2009-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	Xubuntus	seidos	Is pulseaudio kind'a included in ALSA?
2009-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	i think ALSA and pulseaudio are separate.  pulseaudio is *like* a proxy
2009-11-11T06:24:00.000Z	seidos	Xubuntus	this how to might help you out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
