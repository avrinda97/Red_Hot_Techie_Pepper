2006-11-17T16:38:00.000Z	mirak		why don't ubuntu drop apt for conary ?
2006-11-17T16:38:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	never heard of conary, but aptitude is the shorter future I think.
2006-11-17T16:39:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	aptitude is the same. the problems are depencies handling, and to complex package creation.
2006-11-17T16:40:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	I often heard about rpm hell, well, I have been trough deb and apt hell a lot of time !
2006-11-17T16:41:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	so have I. i'm starting to hate software repositories, they are handy for new comers, but hell if you need a single new library or soemthing. I want exe installers ;)
2006-11-17T16:42:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	exactly. I am running through this for VDR.
2006-11-17T16:42:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	and I don't like userhatingness of gentoo
2006-11-17T16:43:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	in fact they should port emerge to debian or something like that, to have a good tool for building in /usr/local/
2006-11-17T16:43:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	don't know VDR. But if you want to update a single component, you need to compile the source, and create a.deb package yourself, and then install that. Worked for me when I wanted to add new perl libs today
2006-11-17T16:46:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	I prefer hung myself than creating a package.
2006-11-17T16:47:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	the only way I ever did packages was with checkinstall
2006-11-17T16:47:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	checkinstall is fine for managing local installs
2006-11-17T16:48:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	I agree, it's hellish. one of the most basic things ubuntu will have to somehow fix. Ubuntu is supposed to give us freedom, but you feel suffocated in situations like that ;p
2006-11-17T16:50:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	the realease cycle of 6 months doesnet help either
2006-11-17T16:51:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	it seems foresight linux is using conary, and it seems advanced in comparison of apt. problem of apt is that it's too old now
2006-11-17T16:51:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	it's simply wishful thinking that everything can be delivered in the repositories.
2006-11-17T16:51:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	well there is to much depencies I think.
2006-11-17T16:52:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	the worst depencies problem happens with devel packages
2006-11-17T16:52:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	I don't know conary, I don't totally dislike apt-get though, and feisty will be adding some nice features to it.
2006-11-17T16:52:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	in fact it's totaly impossible to build a whole apt repository on the same install
2006-11-17T16:53:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	just reading about conary, seems to good to be true. so It will never happen :p
2006-11-17T16:53:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	I think the package conflicts are more bound to a the linux file system hierarchy.
2006-11-17T16:54:00.000Z	mirak	finalbeta	gobo linux is proposing to have a file system similar to windows. in fact the advantage of having each application in it's own folder is that you can have more than one version of the same application, so it reduce conflicts problems I believe
2006-11-17T16:56:00.000Z	finalbeta	mirak	yes, I saw it, I didn't even bother reading more, it will never happen. The file hierarchy is cult to linux freaks. They will never admit it's "inconvenient"
