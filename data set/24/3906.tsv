2007-09-11T14:45:00.000Z	bzwingzero		Is it possible to default the alignment of the desktop icons to the right similar to how it is on a Mac? Currently running ubuntu (Gnome)
2007-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	ph8	bzwingzero	impressed? (with seamonkey)
2007-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	bzwingzero	ph8	it is effectively the old Mozilla client. Firefox+Thunderbird+Sunbird+Chatzilla in one. I prefer them seperate. Less load time when I only need one.

2007-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	ph8		it's extremely useful

2007-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	ph8		!universerepository
2007-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	bzwingzero	ph8	it is the chatzilla client. You can try it before downloading the suite. It is also available as an extension for Firefox.
