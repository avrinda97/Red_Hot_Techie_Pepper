2012-01-16T01:58:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine		Is there anyway i can set an IP for a user? So that the user can only use that IP address for connection to IRC?
2012-01-16T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	the ip address used to connect to irc will be set by your ISP/internet gateway
2012-01-16T01:59:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	i have multiple IP's that are set in /etc/network/interfaces
2012-01-16T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	they will be internal networks addresses, not public
2012-01-16T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	IP's are set per device, not per user
2012-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	if i change /etc/networks/interfaces eth0: to a different IP will it change the IP the uses connect through, and will i have to reboot the server for it to work, or just restart ifconfig?
2012-01-16T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	that will change the ip address of your machine after you reboot it
2012-04-02T03:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	it doesn't live in that file
2012-04-02T03:21:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	Oh ok, so where would i find it?
2012-04-02T03:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	/etc/resolv.conf
2012-04-02T03:22:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	i see, i have added the dns-nameserver to the /etc/network/interfaces but each time i reboot, the dns-nameserver is gone
2012-04-02T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	because it doesn't live in that file
2012-04-02T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	I suspect you may also be using a vps ?
2012-04-02T03:23:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	but if i am setting up a VPN, i need to add it to eth0, and then also to eth0:0 (VPN)
2012-04-02T03:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	no, it doesn't go on the physical interface
2012-04-02T03:24:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	ok, so what am i missing? lol i am following a setup tutorial that i am able to show you if youd like?
2012-04-02T03:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	no idea what you are doing
2012-04-02T03:25:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	trying to setup a VPN so i can connect to it from my iPhone
2012-04-02T03:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	ok
2012-04-02T03:26:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	in the setup tut i am reading, it is saying i need to at the dns-nameservers i find in eth0 and add it to eth0:0
2012-04-02T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	no idea, never needed to do that and it seems a bad idea
2012-04-02T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	that link is for you
2012-04-02T03:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Pseudoephedrine	it's the dns server you want to use
2012-04-02T03:35:00.000Z	Pseudoephedrine	ikonia	I have a VPS, does that mean i have a personal DNS server, or do i need to find out what it is? If so, where do i find it?
