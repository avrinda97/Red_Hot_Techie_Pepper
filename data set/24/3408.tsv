2008-03-20T04:47:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	uh, don't think so
2008-03-20T04:47:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	when you are logged in as root -- how do you change to another user?
2008-03-20T04:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	su <otherusersname>
2008-03-20T04:48:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	right, exactly what i mean -- sudo provides that alternative
2008-03-20T04:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	sudo is a glorified shortcut to su -c, if you are already root, sudo does nothing
2008-03-20T04:49:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	err, i dont agree sudo is a shortcut to su -c .. it's an entirely different executable providing better control of who can and cannot do things on the system
2008-03-20T04:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	it's a glorified shortcut to su -c
2008-03-20T04:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	note the "glorified" part.  of course it's a different executable
2008-03-20T04:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	yes. i know this.  I didn't say sudo was a shortcut to su -c, i said it was a glorified shortcut to su -c.  it does the exact same thing with some additional security measures and other things that dont' really matter.  If you are already root, sudo does nothing.
2008-03-20T04:52:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	you can control what sudo does in the context of root -- which is why /etc/sudoers needs an explicit entry for root
2008-03-20T04:53:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	and if thats the case, you can prevent root from using sudo too
2008-03-20T04:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	what does that do? nothing....  the ENTIRE PURPOSE of sudo is to elevate a users priviledge to root level for 1 command.  If you are already root, elevating roots priviledge to root does nothing
2008-03-20T04:55:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	err no .. sudo isnt always about elevating priviledges, you can use it to drop privilidges (or should i say, logging in as different users) too -- and if you prevent root from using sudo (like how yowshi has somehow done) sudo does something under root -- you get me?
2008-03-20T04:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	name one thing I would want to do as root that I can only do by using sudo first
2008-03-20T04:57:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	when you say "sudo first"? -- does that include things like "sudo cat /etc/sudoers" ?
2008-03-20T04:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	sure
2008-03-20T04:57:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	right, there's one example then :) -- you need to do that as root but sudo first
2008-03-20T04:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	cating /etc/sudoers as root is going to be successful under any circumstance, you don't need to sudo to cat a file
2008-03-20T04:58:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	right .. ok, i see what you mean -- being logged on as root, why do you need sudo -- well, you might want to login as another user (in the way you use su)
2008-03-22T08:45:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	what tonyyarusso means is that there are no open and listening ports on a default install -- and i dont think iptables is configured to an implicit deny
2008-03-22T08:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	no applications listening on a port has nothing to do with the default firewall configuration
2008-03-22T08:46:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	ok, so there are no applications that have ports open, listening for connections on a default install - is that clear now?
2008-03-22T08:47:00.000Z	Fryguy--	unop_	yes that's what I was saying indirectly, and everybody seems to not believe me
2008-03-22T08:58:00.000Z	unop_	Fryguy--	what you are discussing about now is ot anyway :) and you're most welcome here
