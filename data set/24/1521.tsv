2009-12-02T14:46:00.000Z	hri	jarl	: after deleting the file all files come next time when opening
2009-12-02T14:46:00.000Z	hri	jarl	i tried to format but i cant
2009-12-02T14:47:00.000Z	jarl	hri	if it does not complain when you delete the files, the pendrive is probably not write-protected.
2009-12-02T14:47:00.000Z	jarl	hri	how do you format?
2009-12-02T14:47:00.000Z	jarl	hri	if all files are still there next time you plugin the pendrive, then ...
2009-12-02T14:48:00.000Z	jarl	hri	it probably because you have to unmount the pendrive (aka safely remove the device), before you plug it out.
2009-12-02T14:48:00.000Z	hri	jarl	please give solution
2009-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	jarl	hri	I am trying to help you. But to help you I must know what you are doing when you write "format"
