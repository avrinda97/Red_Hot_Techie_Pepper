2006-11-30T17:09:00.000Z	alm_		anybody who can help me with sound problem
2006-11-30T17:10:00.000Z	alm_		i can hear sound from my headphone but no sound from speaker
2006-11-30T17:11:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	on a laptop?
2006-11-30T17:12:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	right click on the speaker in the notification area (next to clock) and select 'Open Volume Control;
2006-11-30T17:12:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	make sure PCM, Master, and Headphone are all unmuted and turned up.
2006-11-30T17:13:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	did you turn up the volume on them?
2006-11-30T17:14:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	any sound out speakers?
2006-11-30T17:15:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	you won't be able to hear sound through the speakers if your headphones are plugged in.
2006-11-30T17:16:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	click on file > Change Device in the Volume Control window and make sure that the ALSA adapter is selected
2006-11-30T17:18:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	i'm not sure at this point. There's no sound from the onboard speakers at all? No gnome sounds or anything?
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	I'm afraid there's a lot of problems with laptop mics under alsa right now.
2006-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	open up a console and run alsamixer
2006-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	possibly. I can't remember what the problem was, but it's a known bug
2006-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	but make sure none of the channels in alsamixer are muted
2006-11-30T17:23:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	still get sound out of headphones?
2006-11-30T17:24:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	it's rather complicated IIRC, and I'm not the best person to guide you in that. I'd check the ALSA website for information.
2006-11-30T17:31:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	you can do an 'lsmod | grep ac97' to see if the ac97 module is loaded...
2006-11-30T17:32:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	but, since you're getting sound from the headphones, i would assume that it is.
2006-11-30T17:32:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	is this a fresh install?
2006-11-30T17:33:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	is that the only module you get?
2006-11-30T17:36:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	maybe try 'sudo modprobe ac97_codec'
2006-11-30T17:42:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	found this thread in the forums: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=305712
2006-11-30T17:42:00.000Z	malakhi	alm_	seems to match your problem exactly
