2006-12-16T12:36:00.000Z	emun		newbie here who is not getting nothing about how to install printer  canon pixma mp150
2006-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	mp150... is that a printer or a multifunction?
2006-12-16T12:40:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	I'm digging for info, but multifunction is what I was afraid of. Those things can be tricky...
2006-12-16T12:42:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	the first advice I'm gonna give is think outside the square. in a lot of cases with printers in particular, a driver from a similar model printer will often work... so keep an eye out for solutions for other similar machines.... I'm googling at the moment....
2006-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	I'm finding two year old info that says your printer isn't supported with linux. That might be out of date info, but it looks like turboprint (USD$39.00 IIRC) might support it...
2006-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	I know it's kinda useless advice after the fact, but I try to search for drivers before I buy the equipment! :-)
2006-12-16T12:48:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	ah, sorry... I think you said you only got ubuntu today, right? :-)
2006-12-16T12:49:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	do you realise that you'll effectively be treating this mp150 as a bunch of kljlknlk;n (cat typing!) seperate devices (scanner, printer, etc) and that you'll be instlaling them seperately?
2006-12-16T12:50:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	for the printing part, this might be useful ( a bit of a messy install, no point/click sorry)   http://mambo.kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~takushi/#canon
2006-12-16T12:51:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	if you go down the turboprint route, try the demo download first, to make sure it works before you pay!
2006-12-16T12:52:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	actually, I suspect that the scanner part might be easier! :-)
2006-12-16T12:54:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	scanning support is coming soon, looks like.... http://pixma.schewe.com/
2006-12-16T12:55:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	I use a samsung ML-1610... it's a little laser with usb... costs about AUD$180.00... I'm happy withh it
2006-12-16T12:56:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	but like I was saying about looking for drivers for other similar machines, the samsung is a good example. I'm using the Samsung ML-1700 driver to run my ML-1610 printer!
2006-12-16T12:56:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	you're welcome. I hope it's of some help!
2006-12-16T12:58:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	the hard part was getting my head around CUPS... it's a bit wierd (but I needed it set up as a network printer that some winders machines could access)....
2006-12-16T13:00:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	a lot of the little printers are more difficult 'cos they're built for winders and they rely on windows drivers to do a lot of the printing work... when you move them to another OS, nothing works. A slightly bigger printer that has its own 'brains' is a lot easier to connect to a non-windows OS, because things like HP-PCL and Postcript  are supported by everything. For example, way back in windows 3.1 days, ANY postscript printer w
2006-12-16T13:01:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	the easiest way out of the printing problem is to look for a non-windows printer, something that speaks a standard language like postscript or PC.... look at the side of the box.. if it says "Requires windows" then you're prolly going to have grief with it!
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	postscript is a language, closely related to PDF in some ways actually, that was one of the first widely used printing languages. It's  a 'page description' language.. "put this text here" draw a circle that big over there, etc, etc...
2006-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	in either case, theprint drivers just make a big file with all the 'page description' stuff in it, and throw it at the printer via usb, paralle, ethernetc, whatever... and the printer figures it out!
2006-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	the difference between that approach and the smaller 'GDI' printers (aka "Windows Printers") is that they rely on the operating system to do almost all of the processing, and that makes it really difficult to move them to a different OS
2006-12-16T13:10:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	a nice place to start with CUPS is to find a brick wall and slam your head on it a few times <GRIN> :-) it's a strange bit of code, a bit tricky.... wait...
2006-12-16T13:11:00.000Z	sonicGB	emun	I'm exagerrating. Actually, it's really pretty good... it's just that the config files are a bit 'different'. :-)
