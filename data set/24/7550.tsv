2005-08-21T15:57:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	depends what you want to install
2005-08-21T15:58:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	I don't know that, sorry
2005-08-22T16:00:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	usually not, no
2005-08-22T16:00:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	apt-get install <name of ftpd package>
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	do apt-cache search ftpd
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	see what ones turn up
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	pick one, install it
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	yes
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	you could for example use IE to do that
2005-08-22T16:01:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	(not the best tool for the job but you will have it on your windows computer)
2005-08-22T16:02:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	yes
2005-08-22T16:02:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	that's better :D
2005-08-22T16:02:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	apt-get install ssh
2005-08-22T16:02:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	then install winscp
2005-08-22T16:02:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	it's like ftp, but better, safer
2005-08-22T16:03:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	a windows scp (secure copy) program
2005-08-22T16:03:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	nope
2005-08-22T16:03:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	it will "Just Work"
2005-08-22T16:03:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	you'd run winscp and tell it the hostname/user/pass of your linux box
2005-08-22T16:05:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	no, it will work
2005-08-22T16:06:00.000Z	popey	Goodspeed	there's stuff about root and passwords on http://ubuntuguide.org/ which is really good
