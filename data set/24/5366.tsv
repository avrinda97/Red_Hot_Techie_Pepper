2006-10-24T14:17:00.000Z	VanessaE		and I think libncurses5-dev or however it's named.
2006-10-24T14:19:00.000Z	VanessaE		Shaun: try using dpkg to install it
2006-10-24T14:19:00.000Z	VanessaE		dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/packagename.blah.blah
2006-10-24T14:19:00.000Z	VanessaE		.deb
2006-10-24T14:21:00.000Z	VanessaE		ok, we're getting someplace.
2006-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	VanessaE		dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq /var/cache/apt/archives/packagename.blah.deb
2006-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	VanessaE		see if THAT does the trick :)
2006-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	VanessaE		and then try [re] installing everything.
