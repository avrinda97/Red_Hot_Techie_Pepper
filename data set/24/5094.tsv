2007-05-17T10:31:00.000Z	NemesisD		hi im on the phone trying to help my boss get some data from a tape drivre
2007-05-17T10:32:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	cool! tape drives!
2007-05-17T10:32:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	i know :/
2007-05-17T10:33:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	you might want to try turning acpi off in the kernel boot options as that usually screws with PCI slots, but use that as a last resort
2007-05-17T10:33:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	what kinda of PCI card is it? some sort of controller card?
2007-05-17T10:34:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	its an adaptec raid card i think
2007-05-17T10:35:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	can you see the raid card at all?
2007-05-17T10:35:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	i think all its detecting is the onboard raid card
2007-05-17T10:36:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	see it with this.. 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi'
2007-05-17T10:36:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	k hold ill tell him
2007-05-17T10:37:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	also, 'dmesg | grep st0' might show something useful
2007-05-17T10:40:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	nothing on the dmesg or the cat
2007-05-17T10:41:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	dang. sounds like the raid controller isnt getting seen at all. try another PCI slot, turn acpi off and boot again?
2007-05-17T10:41:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	how do you turn acpci off?
2007-05-17T10:42:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	select your kernel in grub, hit e, select the kernel line, hit e, add "acpi=off" and press b
2007-05-17T10:43:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	do you think he'd benefit from trying this on a machine with native scsi support?
2007-05-17T10:43:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	yes.
2007-05-17T10:44:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	otherwise, you said it had onboard raid?
2007-05-17T10:44:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	yes but i ithink its sata
2007-05-17T10:44:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	bugger :)
2007-05-17T10:45:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	say wha? hes super loyal to adaptec i think
2007-05-17T10:46:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	well dont tell him that :)
2007-05-17T10:46:00.000Z	NemesisD	Toma-	gotcha ;)
2007-05-17T10:48:00.000Z	Toma-	NemesisD	ive got to go. sorry i couldnt help. good luck!
