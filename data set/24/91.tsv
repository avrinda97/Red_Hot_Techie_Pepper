2012-07-30T14:54:00.000Z	ClearCloud		Just installed Ubuntu server, changed to Static IP and now the server CAN'T resolve addresses, it can access everywhere with IPs but not with Names. Any clue?
2012-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	/etc/resolv.conf
2012-07-30T14:57:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	see what servers are being queries, if any, use command: dig google.com
2012-07-30T14:59:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	does the directory /etc/resolvconf/ exist?
2012-07-30T15:00:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	yes it does
2012-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	man resolvconf
2012-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	I uninstalled resolvconf..
2012-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	i personally uninstall it
2012-07-30T15:02:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	demon stopped?
2012-07-30T15:02:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	I did a shutdown -r now
2012-07-30T15:03:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	i once had to remove /etc/resolvconf ...  but thats just a brute way to fix it
2012-07-30T15:03:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	did you try the dig command? you should before removing
2012-07-30T15:03:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	too late :)
2012-07-30T15:04:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	well try it now
2012-07-30T15:04:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	still the same > ping: unknown host www.google.com
2012-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	not ping, use this command: dig google.com; dig @8.8.8.8 google.com
2012-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	(yes both)
2012-07-30T15:06:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	and second command?
2012-07-30T15:06:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	the second one was success
2012-07-30T15:06:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	then your DNS server is the problem
2012-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	8.8.8.8 is a google public dns server and you say it worked fine
2012-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	ping your dns server
2012-07-30T15:08:00.000Z	violinappren	ClearCloud	looking back at your /etc/resolv.conf... you used your machine address as the DNS server! it should be 192.168.1.1 not .3 in your /etc/resolv.conf
2012-07-30T15:10:00.000Z	ClearCloud	violinappren	thanks man
