2005-12-01T06:43:00.000Z	Locke		are ogg files still legal?
2005-12-01T06:44:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	ogg files will always be legal in format
2005-12-01T06:45:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	that is not true. if you copy a new music album to ogg, you are illegal
2005-12-01T06:45:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	the format is open source and is not 'illegal' or patent encumbered
2005-12-01T06:47:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	right click on them in nautilus and click 'properties'
2005-12-01T06:47:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	yes, click th box "rmember this selection'
2005-12-01T12:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	open synaptic and search for kdebase and kdelibs
2005-12-01T12:08:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	read what i typed, please
2005-12-01T12:08:00.000Z	Locke	nalioth	so what do you want me to do, just uninstall everything that comes up in the search?
2005-12-01T12:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	no, just those two and kdesdk kdeaddons
2005-12-01T12:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	and that should take care of most things
2005-12-01T12:18:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	yes, kde* will probably get rid of most of it
2005-12-27T11:17:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	alt-f2 > conky
2006-01-15T10:59:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	read your private msg from ubotu. he has a way for you

2006-01-15T11:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	unless someone has changed the factoid
2006-01-15T11:02:00.000Z	Locke	nalioth	i did that, the wiki, i clicked on the download it here thing and it say cannot contact server
2006-01-15T11:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	hang on a minute
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	do you have a breezy install cd ?
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	Locke	nalioth	i'm downloading... ummm... 5.10 atm, whichever that one is, i'll have it in about 20 min
2006-01-15T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Locke	then you'll have the smartbootmanager on it
