2008-02-01T07:34:00.000Z	iKap		i got it thanks guys
2008-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	iKap		xubuntu is too simple for me
2008-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	iKap		i got decent specs on my laptop so went wit ubuntu
2008-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	simple...it is awesome
2008-02-01T07:35:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	KDE and Gnome are so bloated...
2008-02-01T07:36:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	and you do realize xubuntu IS ubuntu...just with xfce
2008-02-01T07:36:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	yes i do, i had xubuntu for a good month then upgraded to ubuntu
2008-02-01T07:36:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	!!! you don't upgrade to ubuntu...
2008-02-01T07:36:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	it was a bit too simple for me, which was in a way nice because it ran alot quicker/smoother
2008-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	simple is good
2008-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	but i needed the eye candy just a bit lol
2008-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	simple means less problems
2008-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	that's what compiz is for
2008-02-01T07:37:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	and plus i had decent specs and ram sitting there waiting to be used.. so i said why not?
2008-02-01T07:38:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	true but KDE and Gnome overuse ram and processor usage
2008-02-01T07:38:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	dont worry lol im putting xubuntu on a slower desktop comp that i am getting.. ubuntu is for the laptop :)
2008-02-01T07:39:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	it works fine but it could work better, like i said, it is bloated
2008-02-01T07:40:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	one day you will see what i mean
2008-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	just you wait
2008-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	i promise more problems will arise
2008-02-01T07:42:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	yeah i have a feeling.. then i will go to xfce if thats the case lol. but no really i did have a few issues with gnome.. or "ubuntu" that i didnt have when running xubuntu/xfce
2008-02-01T07:42:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	iKap	ubuntu is the os. both use ubuntu; they just use diff window managers
2008-02-01T07:42:00.000Z	iKap	WhoNeedszzz	yeah i know lol i was just trying to  be more clear.
