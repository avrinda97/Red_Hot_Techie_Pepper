2006-03-30T08:07:00.000Z	amphi	vars	it's bollixed some file in $HOME, try mv-ing the config dir
2006-05-27T09:38:00.000Z	amphi	vars	to burn an iso, just do cdrecord foo.iso (assuming /etc/default/cdrecord is correct)
2006-05-27T09:40:00.000Z	vars	amphi	 well that gave me some new errors   9 cdrecord  fo.iso
2006-05-27T09:42:00.000Z	amphi	vars	it's scsi or ide?
2006-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	amphi	vars	do cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
2006-05-27T09:44:00.000Z	amphi	vars	take the number and put a line in /etc/default/cdrecord like CRD_DEVICE=ATA:1,0,0 where the '1,0,0' are the numbers that command shows you
2006-05-27T09:45:00.000Z	amphi	vars	then you won't need to specify the device to cdrecord every time
2006-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	vars	amphi	the cdrom is at /dev/hdc   what does that tell me?   and the dev=ATA   looks on /dev/hda
2006-05-27T09:50:00.000Z	amphi	vars	wtf? pastebin the output of cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
2006-05-27T11:25:00.000Z	amphi	vars	'kernel' ;)
