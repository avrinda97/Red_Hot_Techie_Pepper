2008-12-19T06:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	what kind of detail?
2008-12-19T06:09:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	usual they are only display the pakage name during upgrade. i wanna know more information about the pakages.
2008-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	i don't have too much experience with the gui update-manager. you might need to use command line for that. is that acceptable?
2008-12-19T06:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	there is a little down-arrow in the update-manager gui, at the botom. have you ever check that out?
2008-12-19T06:12:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	absolutely i use command line for upgrade,
2008-12-19T06:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	ok, roger that. one moment
2008-12-19T06:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	ok. you might want to install  apt-listchanges
2008-12-19T06:14:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	So, there is no way to got it? unless install other package?
2008-12-19T06:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	i don't think so, i could be wrong tho. apt-get does have some options, such as the -v option for verbose
2008-12-19T06:17:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	:), most of time, i use aptitude..
2008-12-19T06:18:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	so, it is should be "apt-get -upgrade -v? is that right?
2008-12-19T06:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	so do i. when you press the g to get the packages, you can see all the packages are going to be installed. at that point...
2008-12-19T06:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	you can use the down arrow, then press enter on any/all packages to see what it say about them. but that may not be what you're looking for
2008-12-19T06:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	or, maybe it is...
2008-12-19T06:20:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	but i wanna know the detail of package before they installed..
2008-12-19T06:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	i need toknow what kind of detail you are wanting
2008-12-19T06:22:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	like the package relation which software. something like that.
2008-12-19T06:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	ok, you do know about highlighting and pressing Enter on a package to view/read what it's about, correct?
2008-12-19T06:24:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	just about..
2008-12-19T06:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	open up aptitude right now... then search for or go to a package, any package, then press Enter on your keyboard. tell me if that's what you're looking for
2008-12-19T06:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	btw, after you have pressed Enter on a package and can see it's details, you can use the down-arrow to go down to the tree-like area under 'Depends'(for example)... you can expand the tree by using the  [  and  ] keys(the bracket keys on your keyboard_
2008-12-19T06:31:00.000Z	Kelen	onetinsoldier	:) thanks advance..
2008-12-19T06:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Kelen	you're welcome
