2010-11-22T18:06:00.000Z	tas	vic20gmr	ok
2010-11-22T18:07:00.000Z	vic20gmr	tas	be aware that ifyou install windows [any version], it will likely screw up grub
2010-11-22T18:08:00.000Z	tas	vic20gmr	yes it will, I don;t have prob with that, I will just add grub entry to windows loader..
2010-11-22T18:08:00.000Z	tas	vic20gmr	oh crap, it says my partitions can't find a mount point D:
2010-11-22T18:10:00.000Z	vic20gmr	tas	 what does gparted?

2010-11-22T18:15:00.000Z	vic20gmr	tas	 is this a second drive? different physicall drive from the one your ubuntu install is on?
2010-11-22T18:15:00.000Z	tas	vic20gmr	yes
2010-11-22T18:16:00.000Z	vic20gmr	tas	im betting it would be easier to disconnect your ubuntu drive, install windows7 normally on this one, and then add windows drive to grub
