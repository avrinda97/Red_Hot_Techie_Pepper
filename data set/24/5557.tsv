2007-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	mcquaid		i've been lazy and didn't upgrade from edgy to feisty yet, but doing so now
2007-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	mcquaid		is it correct that one should have the meta pkg ubuntu-desktop installed?
2007-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	for upgrades
2007-06-22T13:10:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	I believe update-manager will take care of it or warn you... at least I hope it does
2008-06-20T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	just tell people exactly what you want
2008-06-20T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	yes.  locate does not find such a file
2008-06-20T16:31:00.000Z	mcquaid	jrib	locate unfortunately misses files all the time.
2008-06-20T16:32:00.000Z	mcquaid	jrib	it should be under: materials/metal/
2008-06-20T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	where is materials? Start from Steam/
2008-06-20T16:34:00.000Z	mcquaid	jrib	sb /hl2/materials/metal
2008-06-20T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	I don't have that.  Let me start the game.  I may not have played it on wine yet
2008-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	sorry, I don't have any of those files
2008-06-25T20:56:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	pastebin your /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
2008-06-25T20:57:00.000Z	mcquaid	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/22890/
2008-06-25T20:57:00.000Z	mcquaid	jrib	hostname just has mcquaid in it
2008-06-25T20:57:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	what does 'hostname' return?
2008-06-25T20:58:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	reboot should fix it
2008-06-25T20:59:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	when you chroot, aren't you root already?
2008-06-25T21:00:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	no, you are root
2008-06-25T21:00:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	I mean, when I do 'sudo chroot blah' I become root
2008-06-25T21:02:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	and your prompt should now start with a #.  Does it?
2008-06-25T21:02:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	so no need to sudo anything
2008-06-25T21:03:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	np :)  might just be easier to backup and reinstall
2008-06-25T21:04:00.000Z	jrib	mcquaid	you sure you don't have a separate /boot?
