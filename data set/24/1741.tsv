2009-09-14T20:32:00.000Z	Nicd^		I just installed Ubuntu 9.04 on an empty hard drive, but it refuses to boot, instead giving me a grub prompt. I don't know how to go on or boot from there and pressing escape just refreshes the screen. I tried saying root (hd0,0) and setup (hd0), but it did not help. What can I do?
2009-09-14T20:34:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	it seems your boot flasg is wrong
2009-09-14T20:34:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	how would I correct that? I'm at the grub prompt now
2009-09-14T20:36:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	boot again from ubuntu cd/dvd and in the partition setup change the boot flag where you have installed ubuntu
2009-09-14T20:43:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	now the cd fails to boot :/ it's stuck at "Setting Advanced Power Management level to 0xfe (254) [ OK ]"
2009-09-14T20:44:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	that is strange try in the boot options with no acpi
2009-09-14T20:49:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	In the CD menu, I set (under F6 - Other Options) acpi=off, but now it's stuck with the same reason
2009-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	this is going strange to awkward, now try to set default in bios
2009-09-14T20:51:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	what do you mean by "setting default in bios"?
2009-09-14T20:52:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	go to bios and in the main menu there should be some-kind of set default button
2009-09-14T20:58:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	after resetting my BIOS settings the CD boots fine. I'll see now about the boot flag
2009-09-14T21:00:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	good luck
2009-09-14T21:14:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	the boot flag is on in /dev/sda1
2009-09-14T21:14:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	and /dev/sda1 is the partition I would like to boot from
2009-09-14T21:15:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	and you have installed ubuntu in that partition?
2009-09-14T21:15:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	yes
2009-09-14T21:18:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	what was the error again?
2009-09-14T21:18:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	trying to boot the computer just throws me to the grub prompt
2009-09-14T21:18:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	now that you a set the bios on default, have you tries booting ubuntu again?
2009-09-14T21:19:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	yes, doesn't work
2009-09-14T21:20:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	no error? it just throws you. he he, not literally
2009-09-14T21:20:00.000Z	Nicd^	abhifx	yep
2009-09-14T21:21:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	i know it sounds stupid but, try installing it again
2009-09-14T21:22:00.000Z	abhifx	Nicd^	maybe its just a faulty grub install
