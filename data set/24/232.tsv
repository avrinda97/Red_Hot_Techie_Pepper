2012-05-15T23:08:00.000Z	scriptwarlock		halo anyone has idea how to remove the pending installation of some dependencies in ubuntu?
2012-05-15T23:09:00.000Z	kurtwp_	scriptwarlock	are you saying when in the GUI you cannot uninstall and packages
2012-05-15T23:10:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	kurtwp_	i installed something that has unmet deps
2012-05-15T23:11:00.000Z	kurtwp_	scriptwarlock	and now you cann remove it via term window or ubuntu package manager
2012-05-15T23:11:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	kurtwp_	aborted the installation and the deps keeps displaying via update manager but i want this to remove
2012-05-15T23:12:00.000Z	kurtwp_	scriptwarlock	did you try apt-get autoremove <package-name>
2012-05-15T23:12:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	kurtwp_	the package is not installed of course apt-get -f displays the deps but i want it to abort and clean

2012-05-15T23:15:00.000Z	kurtwp_	scriptwarlock	did you try dropping down to recovery mode and delete using aptitude
2012-05-15T23:15:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	kurtwp_	using the apt-get autoremove it only displays unable to locate or couldn't find the package, of course i aborted the installation of that package
2012-05-15T23:16:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	kurtwp_	but a red dot on the top panel keeps displaying the pending deps of that to be installed package
