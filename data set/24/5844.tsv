2006-04-23T14:20:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	type unmount
2006-04-23T14:20:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	type mount to see what's mounted first
2006-04-23T14:20:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	good what did it say?
2006-04-23T14:21:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ mount
2006-04-23T14:21:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	don't paste here
2006-04-23T14:21:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	oh it didnt know
2006-04-23T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	seems you are ready to type sudo cfdisk
2006-04-23T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	is you disk /dev/hda?
2006-04-23T14:22:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	i think
2006-04-23T14:22:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	type sudo cfdisk /dev/hda then.
2006-04-23T14:23:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	highlight your partitions and type d to delete
2006-04-23T14:23:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	when you're done type capital W to write the changes
2006-04-23T14:23:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	yw
2006-04-23T15:11:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	i've removed the linux partitions and reinstalled windows and still can't load it
2006-04-23T15:11:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	what can i do
2006-04-23T15:12:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	what happens?
2006-04-23T15:12:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	grub loads?
2006-04-23T15:13:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	it says grub loader and something, then it says error 20 and stops
2006-04-23T15:13:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	that's it, no windows, or nothing
2006-04-23T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	you should remove grub. you can boot the xp cd to recovery console and type fixboot and fixmbr
2006-04-23T15:14:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	i don't have an actual windows bootable cd, just a recovery cd from my computer, wich install an image
2006-04-23T15:14:00.000Z	fabri	mwe	how i do that
2006-04-23T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	fabri	I don't know how to install the windows mbr then. dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1 will remove grub but I'm not sure if it will leave in a state where it can't boot anything then or the nt bootloader will load
