2009-09-11T15:54:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	Linux can't recover NTFS journals, so it stops working as soon as a Windows user removes it without unmounting it.
2009-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	thats why you should always cleanly remove
2009-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	doesn't help him if other people are using it.
2009-09-11T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	true but its best practice and is advised in windows, treat hardware nice and it will look after you :)
2009-09-12T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	add sudo to the start of each command
2009-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	why would I add sudo?  That would ruin the demonstration.  Obviously root ignores traversal permissions.
2009-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	its not root, its sudo ;)
2009-09-12T00:19:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	if you run a command using sudo, the command will run as root.
2009-09-12T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	so its does, my bad
2009-09-12T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	if you want access to a folder in /tmp then create a folder using sudo then give the user access somehow
2009-09-12T00:20:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	thank you for the advice, but I was demonstrating a fact about Unix permissions.  What you replied to is not related to any problem I'm having.
2009-09-12T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	either with group membership or give ownership to the user
2009-09-12T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	try reading /var/log/kern.log
2009-09-12T00:22:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	nothing relevant.  Isn't that effectively a subset of syslog?
2009-09-12T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	it should be the kernel logs. I think they persist after reboot so should be a good place to start diagnosis
2009-09-12T00:23:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	. . .
2009-09-12T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	does a memory test pass ok?
2009-09-12T00:24:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	do you have any actual reason to think memory might be the culprit?  Because I'm not really interested in leaving my computer off for hours to test my memory.
2009-09-12T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	id say it was possible as the apps run in ram. Is there a certain combination of apps that make it fall over?
2009-09-12T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	you need to establish if there is a pattern to what makes it hang
2009-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	AryehGregor	ActionParsnip	please realize that I've administered a 2 million hits/day Linux server as sole root for about three years.  I'm well-acquainted with general bug-hunting techniques.  This should have been apparent, I hope, from the specificity of my question.  If you don't have anything specific to suggest, then I don't think you can really help much.
2009-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	the fact that ping replies is very perplexing tough, no ssh makes sense though as the sshd service may keel over when the system hangs
2009-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	thats cool. i assume nothing in here due to the range of skills
2009-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AryehGregor	btw, i'm just a dude, not any sort of appointd helper or nothing
