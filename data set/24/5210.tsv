2006-09-24T13:00:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	can you pastebin the output of "lsmod | grep snd"?
2006-09-24T13:01:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	i'm wondering if you have snd_mixer_oss loaded
2006-09-24T13:07:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	 http://www.phpfi.com/156549
2006-09-24T13:11:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	yeah, the oss modules are loaded. are linux-sound-base, alsa-base, and alsa-utils all installed?
2006-09-24T13:12:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I don't know... I just installed ubuntu... everything worked fine for a few days... in vmware no problem either... then last night I changed partition sizes... everything works fine except tha vmware complains about /dev/dsp
2006-09-24T13:12:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	ahh.
2006-09-24T13:12:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	yes, those are installed
2006-09-24T13:12:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	i never screw around with changing existing partition sizes.
2006-09-24T13:14:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I also did that just after I installed ubuntu and after vmware... when I saw that the installer created one big partition
2006-09-24T13:14:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I then created a seperate one for /home
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	as a last resort, you can create the device node manually if you wish. try this: sudo mknod /dev/dsp c 14 3 && sudo chown root:audio /dev/dsp && sudo chmod 660 /dev/dsp
2006-09-24T13:15:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	i can't say what happened if you resized partitions. i don't trust the risk of data loss.
2006-09-24T13:16:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I resized partitons a couple of times on windows...that was never a problem
2006-09-24T13:17:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	alright. good luck :)
2006-09-24T13:18:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	thx for the help... I'll let you know how I go :)
2006-09-24T13:28:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	there's probably some HOWTO's on the 'net that explain unix device nodes as well :)
2006-09-24T13:26:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I love ya ^^ nah, kidding... making the nod and restarting ubuntu helped :)
2006-09-24T13:26:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	woot, cool
2006-09-24T13:26:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	so, what did I actually do with that mknod?
2006-09-24T13:27:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	mknod lets you create character devices or block devices in /dev if you know the parameters
2006-09-24T13:27:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	"man mknod" for more info
2006-09-24T13:28:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	I guess I'll look at that some other time... I'm proud that I know the differnece between a sym- and hardlink ^^ --> linux noob
2006-09-24T13:28:00.000Z	webfreak	hyper	hehe
2006-09-24T13:34:00.000Z	hyper	webfreak	what desktop do you use?
