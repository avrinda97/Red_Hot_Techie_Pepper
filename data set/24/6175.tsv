2006-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	that's the funniest way of calling someone a troll i've ever heard
2006-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	follow the instructions at get-e.org
2006-01-25T12:59:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	i have an easier way, tho.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79155&highlight=enlightenment
2006-01-25T13:03:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	this is the first time i've cvs'd something, how can I implement enlightenment now that the cvs has finished it's fetching?
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	you have to build the software you've fetched using cvs
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	did you get the link i showed you?
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	yessir
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	i guess i don't understand what a cvs is
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	so it downloads the depended packages/files, then I have to build it?
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	a cvs is a versioning system. it keeps track of the very latest source code.
2006-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	try my link to the forums first
2006-01-25T13:05:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	if you follow my ubuntuforums link for e17, you won't harm anything
2006-01-25T13:06:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	ok i didn't see it
2006-01-25T13:06:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	now you will...in a PM
2006-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	beautiful
2006-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	how do you like e17?
2006-01-25T13:09:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	as you say... beautiful
2006-08-11T06:35:00.000Z	mike-e	nalioth	can you think of any way to get ubuntu to recognize and use my ISA pnp Sound Blaster sound card? I added the sb module to etc/modules, I can get sound when playing files through vlc, gnome-volume control works fine and isn't marked as muted (i can toggle it and hear the feedback) however double clicking on mp3's gives me the 'no sound card detected' prompt and system sounds won't play etc
2006-08-11T06:36:00.000Z	nalioth	mike-e	i'm not very good with sound (my box uses the pc-speaker for sounds :0 )
