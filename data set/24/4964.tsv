2010-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	lillis		I am having a whole lot of trouble with Ubuntu installation media. 3 of my four discs (ubuntu server, ubuntu alternate, and a Swedish ubuntu remix) based on 9.10 all hang up halfway through the installation requesting that i put the correct disc in the tray (which I obviously already have)
2010-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	lillis		and I cant boot liveusbs... cant even find the .img files anymore
2010-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	lillis		are there no official ubuntu .img?
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	lillis		well i have used unetbootin on three different flashdrives
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	lillis		with the iso files
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	lillis		and it fails to start up the installer every time
2010-01-13T04:53:00.000Z	genii	lillis	The usual reason for it not finding the CD it booted from is that it doesn't know what driver to use for the motherboard chipset controlling the IDE/SATA bus the CD drive is attached to. Sometimes you can modprobe it in if you know which you need
2010-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	lillis	genii	but the Live CD's boot up and the installation works about halfway through the package installation process
2010-01-13T04:55:00.000Z	genii	lillis	Yes, that symptom fits the problem I described
2010-01-13T04:55:00.000Z	lillis	genii	so you're saying i should modprobe the drivers when the installation error occurs?
2010-01-13T04:56:00.000Z	genii	lillis	No, prior to beginning the install process
2010-01-13T04:59:00.000Z	genii	lillis	The usual two chipsets this works on require either the sata_mv (marvell chipset)  or the sata_via
2010-01-13T04:59:00.000Z	lillis	genii	thanks! will try that..
2010-01-13T05:00:00.000Z	genii	lillis	nforce chipset has another that I forget the module name offhand
2010-01-13T05:11:00.000Z	lillis	genii	tried loading both the via and the marvell modules
2010-01-13T05:16:00.000Z	genii	lillis	Do you have an external USB CD drive? I usually would try from that
2010-01-13T05:17:00.000Z	lillis	genii	i do not :( i have usb sticks but for some reason they refuse to boot Ubuntu
2010-01-13T05:20:00.000Z	genii	lillis	What says result of:  lspci | grep ATA   ?
2010-01-13T05:20:00.000Z	lillis	genii	Intel controllers
2010-01-13T05:21:00.000Z	genii	lillis	ICH7, ICH9, what?
2010-01-13T05:25:00.000Z	lillis	genii	seems to be a problem with NEC drives (which I have one)
2010-01-13T05:26:00.000Z	genii	lillis	Ah, OK. Sometimes I found with ICH9/10 that you need to set in bios for it to use ahci mode as well
2010-01-13T05:27:00.000Z	lillis	genii	yeah gonna check my bios settings too
2010-01-13T05:27:00.000Z	genii	lillis	(on my Asus P5K SE for instance)
