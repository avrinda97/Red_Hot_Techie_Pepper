2009-03-23T03:22:00.000Z	Time`s_Witness		is there any msn client or plugin for linux that displays activity log per user? (logins/logouts/name changes/status changes)
2009-03-23T03:22:00.000Z	Time`s_Witness		similarly to msn plus
2009-03-23T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	probably
2009-03-23T03:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	also theres Kmess and Mercury Messenger a closed source Java app, made by only one guy
2009-03-23T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	try them or find out about them.  also I think there will be a plugin for PIdgin
2009-03-23T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	and MSN plus is a load of rubbish,  it  tends to put spyware or other rubbish on peoples computers as well, even if they say no to the sponser program
2009-03-23T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	it's good your looking into alternatives, but there is a way you can have MSN plus  in Ubuntu well kind of
2009-03-23T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	no not WIne,  a Windows virtual machine instead.  and yes I know Windows LIve Messenger or both with MSN plus,  would be a sucky reason for a virtual machine  or even  to use Wine if they would work there
2009-03-23T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	lol your running  Ubuntu inside Windows?
2009-03-23T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	well good for trying, but then you should partition your hard disk for a real install latero n
2009-03-23T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	oh you got wireless?
2009-03-23T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	your running wireless?
2009-03-23T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	yes the ethernet should just work
2009-03-23T03:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	wireless is the one people tend to get issues with, hence why I was asking.  if you had wireless working in  WIndows, and you were running a virtual machine of Ubuntu, then sure it could be working, but then maybe it won't  in a proper install
2009-03-23T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	yeah  put 9.04 on for real, and do Ext4 as the partition.  Ext4 is pretty new,  no  Ext4 in 8.10
2009-03-23T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	partition?  yes the file system for it
2009-03-23T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	9.04 is next Ubuntu released at the end of April
2009-03-23T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	more experiended users such as myself,  get it  early and use development versions,  but that is not recommended to new users ever!  since bugs.   Have you done Kubuntu yet by the way?  How about Xubuntu?
2009-03-23T03:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	I don't like KDE4 as a GUI,  KDE3 was nice, but sadly they don't make that anymore :(  KDE3 been around for years very nice and stable.   it's not an option in 8.10 though from the repo.  can have both from repo in 8.04.   I do however like some of KDE's apps that I will run in Gnome :)   Xubuntu is like a light waight version of Gnome,  check it out
2009-03-23T03:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	Xubuntu uses XFCE,  XFCE is only really a windowmanager/gui   however  if you do this in terminal:  sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop  that will put  XFCE on as well as  nice apps such as Abiword,  which could be just run in Gnome or KDE anyway
2009-03-23T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	heh I could tell you loads of good apps to install :)
2010-05-20T02:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	nice :) so I guess at the oment you have to shut down using system menu :)
2010-05-20T02:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	or terminal
2010-05-20T02:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Time`s_Witness	or use from system menu :)  or set panels back to default
