2007-04-17T11:58:00.000Z	poobert		how do i make the root of my /www directory viewable from the interwebs?!?!
2007-04-17T11:58:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	chmod the directory to 755
2007-04-17T11:59:00.000Z	poobert	syn_jet	then i must restart the server correct?
2007-04-17T12:00:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	nope, you just change the permission (of the /var/www dir and the files within) by sudoing and then thats it
2007-04-17T12:01:00.000Z	poobert		and it doesn't matter who owns what in the directory right? as long as the permissions are right
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	I guess so, that is why we are sudoing..
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	poobert		still says i don't have permission :(
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	poobert		everyhting has the same damn permissions , but somethings i can view from the web and some i can't :O
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	poobert		Forbidden!
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	that is after you enter the password (for sudo), you get an error saying you are forbidden to do that?
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	poobert	syn_jet	, not from the web, i am trying to access one specific directory or the root and it says "forbidden i don't have permission"
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	poobert		but allt he rest seem to be accessable
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	sudo chmod 755 directory_location_name_that_is_unacessible
2007-04-17T12:09:00.000Z	poobert		if i put the full path of the directory i'm trying to access it shows it, but if i try to go a directory or two up (but not the root of /var/www) it says forbidden!
2007-04-17T12:10:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	could you be more specific? what is the location of the dir you cant access via web?
2007-04-17T12:11:00.000Z	poobert		say "/var/www/poo" is forbidden, but "/var/www/poo/sticks" is
2007-04-17T12:12:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	your naming convention is laudable :D
2007-04-17T12:13:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	chmod 755 -R /var/www/poo/sticks/ or go inside the dir and chmod all the files in there
2007-04-17T12:14:00.000Z	poobert		i did, and isn't that what the "-R" is supposed to do anyway!?!
2007-04-17T12:15:00.000Z	poobert		i don't get this :(
2007-04-17T12:15:00.000Z	syn_jet	poobert	yes.. that should have done.. not sure whats wrong.. just wondering did you clean the browser cache?
2007-04-17T12:15:00.000Z	poobert		like driving a stick shift
2007-04-17T12:16:00.000Z	poobert	syn_jet	, i sure hope thats it
