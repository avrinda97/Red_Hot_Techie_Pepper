2012-01-29T22:59:00.000Z	subb1		 hi all. a very trivial question maybe
2012-01-29T22:59:00.000Z	subb1		 i already have tomboy and stickynotes. But when started they lie along the taskbar with other open windows. Is there any other desktopnote prog that only lies in notification area or not even there ( runs in background) ?
2012-01-29T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	like a daemon notes app? how would you post new notes without a UI?
2012-01-29T23:02:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	hi... i want a gui on desktop :)
2012-01-29T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	then install an ubuntu with a desktop and not the server release..
2012-01-29T23:05:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	oh no. think you got me wrong. I have ubuntu with gnome :) all i wanted was the sticky note to NOT lie in the task bar with other open windows. Its UI should def be on the desktop :)
2012-01-30T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	could use nano, its a bit friendlier
2012-06-19T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	possibly with foremost but you will need a partition mounted writabel that will hold the whole partition. Your backups will be a much quicker method
2012-06-19T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	your backups, or foremost
2012-06-19T18:23:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	i think i'll go with foremost. I do not have any backups !!
2012-06-19T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	why not, is yourdata not important to you?
2012-06-19T18:23:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	it was. But i had newly transferred the files to a system.. didnt take thebackup...
2012-06-19T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	you learned the value of backups the hard way...
2012-06-19T18:24:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	very true. thanks for help.. thanks a lot... i shall give it a try
2012-07-24T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	ask and see
2012-07-24T13:24:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	had asked already, okay repeat:   ""I'm trying to configure pptp vpn from network manager(gui) in 11.10. But its says connection failed always. please help!""
2012-07-24T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	can you ping the vpn end point
2012-07-24T13:25:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	: yes. I can ping
2012-07-24T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	does the vpn endpoint use the same subnet as your home lan?
2012-07-24T13:27:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	I just got the vpn details to connect.
2012-07-24T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subb1	can you connect on other systems
2012-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	I have only my system to check. No other for trials. :(
2012-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	subb1	ActionParsnip	would it help if I can paste you the syslog o/p when failed to connect?
