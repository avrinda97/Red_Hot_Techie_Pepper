2007-07-19T07:34:00.000Z	jerbull88		does anyone know how to get a slave hdd to mount automatically
2007-07-19T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	add it to /etc/fstab
2007-07-19T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	what is the /dev/name of the drive, what is its filesystem and what is its desired mount point?
2007-07-19T07:38:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	no the /dev/name, it needs to have something like /dev/hda1
2007-07-19T07:39:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	do sudo fdisk -l, it has a definite name
2007-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	alright where did you want to mount it, /media/hda2 maybe?
2007-07-19T07:42:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok well make sure /media/hda2 exists "sudo mkdir /media/hda2
2007-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	just go to the next line
2007-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok so do "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab" and add "/dev/hda2 /media/hda2 ext3 defaults 0 0"
2007-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	space between /dev/hda2 and /media/hda2
2007-07-19T07:48:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	yes, now get out of that and do "sudo mount -a"
2007-07-19T07:50:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok so then it is not ext3
2007-07-19T07:51:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok try "sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda2 /media/hda2"
2007-07-19T07:51:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	by the way /dev/hda2 sounds like the second partition on your main drive, not some other slave drive
2007-07-19T07:53:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	the second partition of your slave drive?
2007-07-19T07:54:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ahhh, /dev/hdb1 right? if it has only one partition
2007-07-19T07:55:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	well you know how many partitions it has on it, is it just one?
2007-07-19T07:56:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok well remove the old mount point for the wrong drive "sudo rmdir /media/hda2" then make the new one "sudo mkdir /media/hdb1"
2007-07-19T07:56:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	then run sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 /media/hdb1
2007-07-19T07:57:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	did it mount?
2007-07-19T07:58:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ls /media/hdb1
2007-07-19T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	if it didn't error then it mounted, that is another way to know
2007-07-19T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok do "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab" and change the hda2 stuff to hdb1
2007-07-19T08:00:00.000Z	bruenig	jerbull88	ok so it should be done
