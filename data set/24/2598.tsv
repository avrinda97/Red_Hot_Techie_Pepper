2008-11-04T03:33:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		thanks!
2008-11-04T03:34:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		so I'll post my menu.lst again, and try pastebin
2008-11-04T03:35:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		VoltageX: So did the pastebin work?
2008-11-04T03:36:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		oh (shy face)
2008-11-04T03:36:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		http://paste.ubuntu.com/66992/
2008-11-04T03:38:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		VoltageX: it's wierd because ubuntu put winXP on hd1,0 which shouldn't be the case

2008-11-04T03:39:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	What's the issue, I just saw your pastebin up there.
2008-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	I had the same issue the other day
2008-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	how many partitions do you have?
2008-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	Just the windows and Ubuntu?
2008-11-04T03:40:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	I have 3 parts on SATA (Win, Ubuntu, and Data)
2008-11-04T03:41:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	then another hd.
2008-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	I upgraded to Intrepid the other day.  I assume you're doing the same? Are all partitions on the same drive?
2008-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	The winxp entry was defaulted by ubuntu install
2008-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	but my winxp part is not on hd1,0 it should be hd0,0
2008-11-04T03:44:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	I don't know how much voltagex told you, but Error 2 means it can't find the boot information.  Do you remember which partition you told it to install to?
2008-11-04T03:45:00.000Z	Fondor1	Socapex_2K	It shouldn't have anything to do with your XP partition yet at all.
2008-11-04T03:45:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	: Ubuntu?
2008-11-04T03:45:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	: Ubuntu is on third part
2008-11-04T03:46:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Fondor1	: and I don't think I've upgraded intrepid
