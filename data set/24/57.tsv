2012-09-19T05:46:00.000Z	unless__		Hello guys!
2012-09-19T05:46:00.000Z	unless__		I am trying to log to a ssh service on a server as root and I've heard it is not possible.
2012-09-19T05:47:00.000Z	unless__		Could someone point me a reason I could search for more information related please?
2012-09-19T05:48:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	ssh url
2012-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	what is that ?
2012-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Sorry, just: ssh [insert url without brackets]
2012-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	I know that, but what do you mean ?
2012-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	To log in, you would have to have those privileges on your account.
2012-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	I know but I am unable to connect from outside my local network as root.
2012-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Did you try su or sudo?
2012-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	as sudo ssh ?
2012-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Yes, or just plain sudo.
2012-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	not haven't tried it. are you sure about that ?
2012-09-19T05:53:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	No, but it doesn't hurt to try.
2012-09-19T05:54:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	the point is it doesn't make sense what you are saying.
2012-09-19T05:54:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Are you trying to login to ssh?
2012-09-19T05:55:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	yes
2012-09-19T05:55:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Oh. THen you: ssh [url] and then it will ask for your username and password
2012-09-19T05:56:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	exactly but as I am trying to log as root it doesn't allows.
2012-09-19T05:56:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	You have to set it up, hold on.......
2012-09-19T05:58:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	Run this http://paste.ubuntu.com/1214040/
2012-09-19T05:59:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	thank you, seems it is what I was looking for.
2012-09-19T06:00:00.000Z	JasonO	unless__	No problem, sorry about the confusion.
2012-09-19T06:00:00.000Z	unless__	JasonO	no problem. Thank you.
