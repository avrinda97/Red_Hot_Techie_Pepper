2008-02-21T05:57:00.000Z	norml_advocate	prince_jammys	 i am about to reinstall ubuntu and am just trying to save my music.
2008-02-21T05:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	a cd that you boot into so you can mess with partitions without them being mounted
2008-02-21T05:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	be careful
2008-02-21T05:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	ok, get the live cd
2008-02-21T05:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	it's not quick, usually
2008-02-21T06:02:00.000Z	norml_advocate	prince_jammys	is this the easiest way to make a partition?
2008-02-21T06:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	yes, but you cant just casually and quickly do this. if you're in a hurry, i recommend you wait
2008-02-21T06:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	go to the above link, download and burn the live cd and read a bit about it to learn how it's done
2008-02-21T06:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	because you cant repartition the drive that is currently mounted
2008-02-21T06:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norml_advocate	yes
2008-02-21T06:04:00.000Z	norml_advocate	prince_jammys	interesting
