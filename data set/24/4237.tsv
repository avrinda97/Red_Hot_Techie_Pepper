2007-06-01T09:13:00.000Z	excalibas		hello, can someone help me to transfer some files from xubuntu to xp from network, i have been trying from tutorials but i am a bit confused
2007-06-01T09:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 easy way is use ssh and the winscp client.
2007-06-01T09:14:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	these are stuff i download with synaptic?
2007-06-01T09:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 i think ya shoudl  ask about what exactly you are trying to do then....
2007-06-01T09:55:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	in my home network how do i know the name of the server to connect winscp to xubuntuu?
2007-06-01T09:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 use its ip# is what i do
2007-06-01T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 ifconfig will show the ip#
2007-06-01T10:03:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	it is not working, what is this sshf i just installed in linux, do i have to use this?
2007-06-01T10:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 never used sshfs - Its highly likely that vista's firewall is blocking stuff. try disabling it for a while as a test.
2007-06-01T10:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 sshfs lets your linux box mount ssh  'connections' as if they were partitions. Not what you need I belive.
2007-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	the firewall is disabled, i dont need to do nothing on linux, just run winscp should work?
2007-06-01T10:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 you do have ssh installed on the linux box?
2007-06-01T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 i think ya need to have the openssh package installed and started
2007-06-01T10:09:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	ok ill do that
2007-06-01T10:12:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	i need the openssh client or server?
2007-06-01T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 may as well install both.
2007-06-01T10:16:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	it is installed, now how do i get ssh to run?
2007-06-01T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 try 'ssh localhost' and see if it works
2007-06-01T10:18:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
2007-06-01T10:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 yes. and you may want tor ead a few ssh tutorials.
2007-06-01T10:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 you have reminded me of why i dont want to mess with vista. :)
2007-06-01T10:54:00.000Z	excalibas	dr_willis	it is not vista, it is xp, and i juse it because i cant get the software i need no work on linux  yet
2007-06-01T10:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 ok - earlier i though you said you were on vista.   Hmm ssh still aint working with winscp eh?
2007-06-01T11:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	excalibas	 i tink its  'sshd start'
