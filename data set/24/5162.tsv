2006-11-11T10:22:00.000Z	Akuma_		(newb question warning) what shortcut do i use to access a window's menu? [file | edit | view | ..etc]  ?
2006-11-11T10:24:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	in most places its Alt+F
2006-11-11T10:49:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	I used to be, got tired of it though, nowdays I'm more of a sysadmin
2006-11-11T10:24:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	hmm... thanks. most places, exept in xchat eh :)
2006-11-11T10:25:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	that would be Alt+X (the line under the "X" is your hint)
2006-11-11T10:26:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	ohh.. i see.. i'm used to alt only to get there. well thats neeter though. thnaks eh
2006-11-11T10:27:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	F10 seems to work too actually
2006-11-11T10:29:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	even better then. both styles. funny how you don't get to see what you're missing in a Windows world eh.
2006-11-11T10:31:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	if you gonna just use linux for a few years you'll have the same experiance coming to windows, I can't tell how many time I tried to "ls" or "grep" in a cmd window
2006-11-11T10:33:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	what i'm saying though is 'linux' seems to be a lot more flexible and well planned; so things are not only different, they're actually better. although i've been on linux for only a week.. but still
2006-11-11T10:34:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	welcome then, hope you have a plesent stay ;)
2006-11-11T10:35:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	thank you :) im here to stay. no vista DRM crap for me
2006-11-11T10:36:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	actually I'm unsure thats a good enough reason, coming to Linux just becasue you don't want windows, might not keep you on Linux long enough to really begin to enjoy it, let me warn you, there is a bumpy road ahead of you
2006-11-11T10:38:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	drm is only a drop in the water. the main reason i switched was because i'm a programmer, and linux really seems like a much better environment for this ( i dont do .NET). i've been planning switching for over a year
2006-11-11T10:39:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	and over that year i have been using only exclusively open source and linux compatible/equivalent applications, so i actually still feel at home in linux, even though its been just a week
2006-11-11T10:41:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	if you want a really good book for learning the UNIX way of programming, google for Eric Rymond's "The Art of UNIX Programming" its available for free online, and one of the best programming books I've read
2006-11-11T10:43:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	thanks for the tip, i'll certainly get a copy. i'm a web developer though, so the actual system differences only have a minor influence for me (which definatly help the transition). But i'd like to do so desktop apps too, so i'll definatly take a look at the book
2006-11-11T10:44:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	its a whole different way of thinking, I think it'll influence you even as a web developer
2006-11-11T10:45:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	then i'll take a look at it soon, before i seriously get started again. how long ago did you switch to linux?
2006-11-11T10:46:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	when dinasors walked the earth.... j/k but it must have been more then 7 years ago
2006-11-11T10:47:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	thats about the time i got my first pc :)
2006-11-11T10:48:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	and you're a programmer too? i mean, for a living?
2006-11-11T10:51:00.000Z	Akuma_	ifireball	well i've gotta get going. thanks again for the tips eh
2006-11-11T10:51:00.000Z	ifireball	Akuma_	n/p have fun!
