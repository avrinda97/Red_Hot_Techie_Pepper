2005-11-27T12:03:00.000Z	selutha		I have a laptop that the builtin nic causes problems and i want to stop it from loading. It is loading a 3com 3c59x. How can i stop this from loading on boot up?
2005-11-27T12:05:00.000Z	selutha		or another quesition is if i have a buitin 3c59x on-board nic and lets say i put in a 3c59x pci card how can i have it not load anything for the onboard and load the drivers for the pci card?
2005-11-27T12:06:00.000Z	selutha		if someone can give me a keyword or point me in the right dircetion i think i google can solve the rest
2005-11-27T12:08:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	usually you would set this kind of thing via a kernel boot option in /boot/grub/menu.lst .
2005-11-27T12:08:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	it is possible that with the right option you might even get the card to work properly.
2005-11-27T12:09:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	HappyFool uhoo thanks both of you totally forgot about bios :/ and thanks for the menu.lists i can googe the correct stuff from there i think
2005-11-27T12:10:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	acually the internal card is really boked that is why the lap was free. everything works until i activate it. I think it has something to do with the ibm implementation of it. So far it can work in windows only when you use a special driver from ibm.
2005-11-27T12:11:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	I see. Well, maybe the BIOS option will fix it for you.
2005-11-27T12:12:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	ya i hope it will but didnt know i could pass stuff like that in menu.lst have to look that up too :) all good knowledge thanks
2005-11-27T12:28:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	k the bios didnt do it, so if i want to pass this through the menu.lst how to do that is dictated by the version of kernel right?
2005-11-27T12:30:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	no, there is a line that says # kopt=... Everything there gets appended to every kernel you boot.
2005-11-27T12:32:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	sorry i didnt word my question very well, I am trying to find out what i need to pass to the kernel. Where can i find what i can pass listed? is there a man file or is there somewhere on the web?
2005-11-27T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	I'll have a quick look.
2005-11-27T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	I can't find the answer quickly.
2005-11-27T12:40:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	np that web page you sent me is very helpful, i think i can google it from here thanks alot
2005-11-27T12:40:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	to see if disabling the card would work, you could move the driver modules to a location where the kernal doesn't find it.
2005-11-27T12:40:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	even with it disabled in the bios it still comes up :/ but i have thought about moving the module
2005-11-27T12:41:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	at this point i am trying to expand my understanding some
2005-11-27T12:41:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	it may be in your initrd, though, in which case it will be harder to move.
2005-11-27T12:41:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	the simplest thing i can think of is have it run a script to unload the moudule after it finishies booting
2005-11-27T12:43:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	if it's not too late at that point, great.
2006-11-06T07:59:00.000Z	soundray	selutha	you can mount NTFS read/write using fuse, but I don't know if it'll work from the live CD. Try it out:
2006-11-06T07:59:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	cool thanks..
2006-11-06T08:04:00.000Z	selutha	soundray	thanks for the link, cant do it with the live but it pointed me to where i could thanks for the help
