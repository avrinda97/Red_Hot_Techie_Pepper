2007-07-09T10:26:00.000Z	sylvisj		ok, seriously need some nvidia help
2007-07-09T10:26:00.000Z	sylvisj		Dunno what happened, but I need to clean the drivers and reinstall
2007-07-09T10:26:00.000Z	sylvisj		something is royally fubared
2007-07-09T10:27:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	What is the problem?
2007-07-09T10:29:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	so you are in x with vesa or nv driver at the moment
2007-07-09T10:29:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	I'm on irssi in a console
2007-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	is the nvidia module loading?  as in modprobe nvidia
2007-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	yes'
2007-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	and nvidia-glx is also installed   -- just covering the bases first
2007-07-09T10:31:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	it should have been, the installer doesn't seem to have done it right
2007-07-09T10:32:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	and you ahve tried reinstalling nvidia-glx etc...
2007-07-09T10:32:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	, yes
2007-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	is there anything else in the error for loading nvidia-glx
2007-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	, not really
2007-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	unusual
2007-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	I'm well aware of this ;)
2007-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep nvidia
2007-07-09T10:37:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	anything more informative with    cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i nvidia
2007-07-09T10:38:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	have you had it running using the nvidia driver before?
2007-07-09T10:38:00.000Z	sylvisj	tonic-pushcart	yes, yesterday
2007-07-09T10:39:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	and if you do is there a line in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf that specifies the pci bus or something like that for the card?
2007-07-09T10:40:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	this is the template for the line    BusID       "PCI:2:0:0"
2007-07-09T10:41:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	first try disabling that line    it causes all sorts of problems
2007-07-09T10:42:00.000Z	tonic-pushcart	sylvisj	ah well, I thought... nevermind  fair nough
