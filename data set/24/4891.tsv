2007-09-24T13:04:00.000Z	leobloom		hallo!
2007-09-24T13:05:00.000Z	leobloom		is it normal than I cant cut or move files on a ntfs partition but just copy them even after installing the ntfs-3g?
2007-09-24T13:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	how did you mount the partition? what command did you use?
2007-09-24T13:08:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	dont remember, I installed this application in June and came back home only yesterday, hadnt nonticed I couldnt cut files, if iremember well after installing ntfs-3g it asked me to chooose which partitions to mount via gui (but I?m not 100% sure)
2007-09-24T13:09:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	paste the relevant line from /etc/fstab here
2007-09-24T13:09:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	I had installed ntfs-3g already before but  it didnt let me access to the partitions at all, to any except home  and /, then I unistalled it and reinstalled and i thought it was working ok
2007-09-24T13:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	make sure it is using ntfs-3g as the type in /etc/fstab
2007-09-24T13:11:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	and how can I be sure?
2007-09-24T13:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-09-24T13:11:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	 already done it, I'm lookin for the pastebin site

2007-09-24T13:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	sudo umount /media/backup
2007-09-24T13:17:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	 a minute, my pc is slow lol .D and I'm even slower :D
2007-09-24T13:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	also if you add this line to /etc/fstab, it will auto mount on boot:
2007-09-24T13:19:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	 after tryuing to mount backup says that themounting point for it doesnt exist o.O
2007-09-24T13:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	sudo mkdir /media/backup    then try to mount it
2007-09-24T13:21:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	it says "unknowkn filesystem type ntfs-3g"
2007-09-24T13:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	sorry try this: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda6 /media/backup
2007-09-24T13:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	leobloom	u may not need sudo
2007-09-24T13:23:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	it said ntfs-3g wasnt installed o.O!!! Now I'm reinstalling again...
2007-09-24T13:26:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	now it says the ntfslog is not clean,, I need to reboot to free it, right?
2007-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	leobloom	MasterShrek	it works! I forced the cleaning and the mounting :D thanks a lot!!!!
