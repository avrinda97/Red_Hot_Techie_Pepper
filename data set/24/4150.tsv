2007-06-26T12:06:00.000Z	mezziah	WantSomeHelp	looks like it's windows' fault, your menu.list seems to be complete.

2007-06-26T12:07:00.000Z	WantSomeHelp	mezziah	 there is "Error 17" message.
2007-06-26T12:08:00.000Z	mezziah	WantSomeHelp	well, yes, you can reinstall grub,... and about your error 17 message, ask google, i bet many other persons had that error before
2007-06-26T12:09:00.000Z	WantSomeHelp	mezziah	 i tried to google but aint get any good result. coz i m new with linux not familiar with grub
