2004-10-29T12:11:00.000Z	mteira		What is the state of totem-gstreamer? is it usable?
2004-10-29T12:13:00.000Z	mteira		totem-xine didn't work perfectly, anyway.
2004-10-29T12:13:00.000Z	mteira		I use beep-media-player for audio.

2004-10-29T12:18:00.000Z	mteira		I have a lot of trouble with my AMD 756 USB and ubuntu.
2004-10-29T12:19:00.000Z	mteira		I'm not sure if it's ubuntu specific or it's a kernel problem.
2004-10-29T12:19:00.000Z	mteira		Perhaps the second.
2004-10-29T12:19:00.000Z	Mithrandir	mteira	what kind of problems?
2004-10-29T12:19:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	boot process hangs.
2004-10-29T12:20:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	hald in D state forever.
2004-10-29T12:20:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	So, nothing is working.
2004-10-29T12:20:00.000Z	Mithrandir	mteira	why do you think this has anything to do with your USB setup?
2004-10-29T12:20:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	cat /proc/bus/usb/devices hangs forever.
2004-10-29T12:20:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	Everything happens when I plug in my usb scanner.
2004-10-29T12:21:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	After some time, it says something about a timeout, and then, all this problems.

2004-10-29T12:23:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	I've made so.
2004-10-29T12:23:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	I filled a bug a week ago.
2004-10-29T12:23:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	But my bug was marked as duplicate and the original one was closed.
2004-10-29T12:23:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	I've found another one and added a comment to it.
2004-10-29T12:24:00.000Z	mteira	Mithrandir	No, finally I've found 1923.
