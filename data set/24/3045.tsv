2010-04-05T08:30:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda		I've got a copy of bactrack 4 on a disc already, but I'd prefer to have a patched driver to use from the Ubuntu distro already on my PC. I tried to find out how to apply it via Google, but my search results turned up old obscure forum posts lacking in full explanations and highly technical jargon that I had trouble following. I don't need kindergarten style instructions, just something that tells me how to use it.
2010-04-05T08:32:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	what are you trying to do ? I don't think cracking wireless connection is subject for this channel...
2010-04-05T08:33:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	I'm not trying to find out how to crack a wireless network, I just need to know how to use a .patch file.
2010-04-05T08:33:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	that is all? patch -Np1 -i <file>
2010-04-05T08:33:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	do that inside the source directory which will be patched
2010-04-05T08:33:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	and, I'm supposing you are using a 1 level patch
2010-04-05T08:34:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	I would say yes, but I'm not sure. It's a wireless driver patch, rtl8180-0.21v2.patch
2010-04-05T08:36:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	okay, so try it and see the output.
2010-04-05T08:36:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	so I should copy it to the driver file directory and run it from there, or I should copy the driver file to a new directory with the patch file and run it?
2010-04-05T08:37:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	just go inside the source directory of the rtl8180 driver, and add the path to the patch file after -i option
2010-04-05T08:38:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	kk, thanks. I'll find the driver directory and give that a try.
2010-04-05T08:38:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	but did you downloaded the driver from realtek ?
2010-04-05T08:39:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	no, it's the default driver installed with Karmic, I'm assuming
2010-04-05T08:39:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	so first you have to pick the driver source to apply a patch to it
2010-04-05T08:40:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	as in I need to find the driver already on my computer, or download a new source?
2010-04-05T08:41:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	you don't have the source on you computer, you have to first downloaded it, if you are using the default one provided by karmic so use apt-get to get the source
2010-04-05T08:41:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	Kk
2010-04-05T08:42:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	apt-get --download source <file-name>
2010-04-05T08:43:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	but I really think you source is inside the kernel, so may be easier to get the driver from realtek, but like I don't have realtek boards here I can't give you any further help
2010-04-05T08:44:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	ooooh, I understand. So to apply the patch basically you're saying I'd have to apply it to my system kernel? I guess I'll just go with a Backtrack livedisc, lol
2010-04-05T08:45:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	right. But, why are you needing to patch you driver ?
2010-04-05T08:46:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	According to the aircrack-ng website I need to patch the driver to allow packet injection. I'm working on my own personal network pen test.
2010-04-05T08:47:00.000Z	maginot	paraplegicpanda	well, I still prefer using a dlink card, have packet injection support out-of-the box
2010-04-05T08:49:00.000Z	paraplegicpanda	maginot	If I decide to start screwing with my friends and messing with their networks I'll probably look into that. I probably will if I can get it to work on my home network. Otherwise I don't really want to spend any more money than necessary to figure this out.
