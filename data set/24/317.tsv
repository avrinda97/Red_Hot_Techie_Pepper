2011-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	shovell		hey i have a toshiba satellite and i cant get touchpad drivers help!
2011-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	which satellite?
2011-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	does it work any?
2011-12-14T23:03:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 c655d-s5126 yes it works it just is not recognizing it as a touchpad
2011-12-14T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	just because hardware is recognised as something doesn't mean it will work
2011-12-14T23:04:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 ???what???
2011-12-14T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	all your hardware will tell you what it is, doesn't mean its going to run as expected
2011-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	i know that.... i cant find a hardware list where i might be able to fix this
2011-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	can you expand the question please
2011-12-14T23:10:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 in windows there is a hardware manager  i am running ubuntu 10.10 and i remember i found something similar in 9.04 i think
2011-12-14T23:11:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 bottom line my mouse is recognized as a regular mouse not a touchpad
2011-12-14T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	ok, let me search, see what toshes need to make touchpads work
2011-12-14T23:13:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 thank you
2011-12-14T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	press Fn+F9   does it now work...
2011-12-14T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	your system probably has a shortcut combo to disable touchpad, press it
2011-12-14T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	its in the mouse options, search in dash
2011-12-14T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	found the boot option:  acpi=ht   which may help too
2011-12-14T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	or try the boot option: acpi=copy_dsdt
2011-12-14T23:22:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 is there a way i can tell it that it is not a logitech ps2 mouse but really a touchpad?
2011-12-14T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	Ive seen this a few times, if you formulate an xorg.conf you can explicitly tell it
2011-12-14T23:24:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	 uhhhh hmm still kinda a noob here
2011-12-14T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	searching will show you examples
2012-01-16T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shovell	make a script to unload or load the driver module depending on if its already loaded, then have the script run when you press a shortcut using CCSM
2012-01-16T03:38:00.000Z	shovell	ActionParsnip	WOW  um huh
