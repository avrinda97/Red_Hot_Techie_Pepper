2010-02-07T08:02:00.000Z	allowoverride		I have an issue - i can not ping gateway ip 192.168.1.1, can someone help out?
2010-02-07T08:03:00.000Z	allowoverride		so, can someone walk me through troubleshooting?
2010-02-07T08:04:00.000Z	allowoverride		im serious. its a new ubuntu-server install, i installed with all 3 nics. and now im at the point where i will just restart the install and start again. it doesnt make any sense. matter of fact, this happend a while go. i did the route add default gw 192.168.1.1 , ipfconfig eth0 up,  and nothing.
2010-02-07T08:05:00.000Z	allowoverride		the odd thing is, when in installed, it worked fine. static ip'd and all, but when i rebooted, it wouldnt ping yahoo.com or ip gw.

2010-02-07T08:07:00.000Z	allowoverride		im pretty sure this is not normal issue, and if your good, this should be a challenge. i really dont want to start from scratch and kill another 45 mins
