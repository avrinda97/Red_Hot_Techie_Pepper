2011-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm immediatley gave another bash prompt but i reboot -h anyway. it did not fix the problem
2011-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	i'm logged into a tty right now with the same password
2011-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	should i be trying to reconfigure something other than gdm since i use xfce?
2011-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	did you do anything to precipitate this?.. install graphics drivers, or whatever?
2011-07-04T08:11:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	would have been helpful if you mentioned using gdm
2011-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	will i try the same with xfce instead of gdm?
2011-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	probably, but i'm not 100%
2011-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	if  you were me you would tho, right? :)
2011-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	if i were you, i'd have told people i was using xfce from the beginning
2011-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	that ship has sailed, my bad
2011-07-04T08:13:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	trying it
2011-07-04T08:15:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	it says xfce is not installed when i try that
2011-07-04T08:15:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	what did you type?
2011-07-04T08:17:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xfce
2011-07-04T08:17:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	thats not gonna do anything, i could have told you that
2011-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	i thought you said probably when i asked if i should do it a minute ago :)
2011-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	ah okay
2011-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	only other thing you could try (at least that i know of) is sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2011-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	so we can't just replace gdm with whatever xfce uses for the reconfigure command
2011-07-04T08:19:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	gdm is "Gnome Display Manager"...
2011-07-04T08:19:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	okay, and then reboot -h again?
2011-07-04T08:21:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	no change. could it be a disk space issue?
2011-07-04T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	dusf	i wouldn't think so.
2011-07-04T09:31:00.000Z	dusf	KM0201	bazhang: fix for my problem is above if you guys are interested.
