2012-08-02T22:32:00.000Z	jameson		I turn my server on today and it no longer accepts my passphrase to mount the system
2012-08-02T22:32:00.000Z	jameson		can someone please help me
2012-08-02T22:33:00.000Z	jameson		live cd also denies passphrase
2012-08-02T22:34:00.000Z	jameson		I'm really disappointed that it takes losing all my files to realize just how unreliable ubuntu is as an OS
2012-08-02T22:34:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	How did you lose your files?
2012-08-02T22:35:00.000Z	jameson	rypervenche	the file system won't load
2012-08-02T22:35:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	lol, that definitely makes Ubuntu a bad OS, lol.
2012-08-02T22:35:00.000Z	jameson	rypervenche	yeah it makes it a miserable os
2012-08-02T22:36:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	You had the entire drive encrypted?
2012-08-02T22:36:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	I don't see how you would lose everything.
2012-08-02T22:36:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	Have you tried mounting the drive on a livecd?
2012-08-02T22:37:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	Try doing it manually.
2012-08-02T22:37:00.000Z	jameson	rypervenche	thanks will try I'm sorry I'm just very frustrated and at the point of tears
2012-08-02T22:37:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 LUKS
2012-08-02T22:37:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	Change the /dev/sda2 to whatever the drive is.

2012-08-02T22:58:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	^^ Not sure what may have caused that.
2012-08-02T22:58:00.000Z	jameson	rypervenche	there was a power outage possibly somthing got corrupted
2012-08-02T22:59:00.000Z	rypervenche	jameson	Ahh, that could do it. I recommend you backup your headers.
