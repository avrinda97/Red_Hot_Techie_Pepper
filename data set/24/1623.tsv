2010-01-14T20:09:00.000Z	marcelo		hi, I having problems to connect to the internet. When I click the small network icon on upper right corner there is no eth0 connected is this normal? What is happening?
2010-01-14T20:10:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	"sudo ifconfig -a" ,is eth0 available?
2010-01-14T20:12:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	This is the output http://codepad.org/BHrSULHu
2010-01-14T20:15:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	so, eth0 is there but it's not configured
2010-01-14T20:16:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	I do not know how to configure it manually ... could guide me on that?
2010-01-14T20:17:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	sure, you need some info like, ip address default getway and DNS if you need it
2010-01-14T20:19:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	I really do not know how to gather this information ... what should I do?
2010-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	do you have any other operational computer nearby?, if yes get the info from it
2010-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	are you on Ubuntu at this moment?
2010-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	no I do not. unfortunately.
2010-01-14T20:21:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	yes
2010-01-14T20:22:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	so I suppose eth1 is the interface plugged, right?
2010-01-14T20:22:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	yes
2010-01-14T20:24:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	I have just installed 9.10 it worked just fine with 9.04
2010-01-14T20:24:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	 then just plug the other interface and you'll have eth0 configured, you'll lose connection one moment, eth0 will replace eth1
2010-01-14T20:25:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	unplug eth1 and plug the other interface
2010-01-14T20:27:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	sorry, but I do not know how to do it . But it must be plugged , I was using the pc yesterday normally, I did not unplugged anything ...
2010-01-14T20:29:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	working with eth1 will be just fine, don't worry about eth0
2010-01-14T20:30:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	well I would like to fix this .
2010-01-14T20:32:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	"sudo lspci -v"
2010-01-14T20:33:00.000Z	marcelo	epinky	http://codepad.org/4J6Hejsh
2010-01-14T20:36:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	you have 2 Gigabit Ethernet controllers
2010-01-14T20:37:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	if you want to fix then  then unplug your current connection(the cable) and connect the cable to the other interface, just that, you'll lose connection one moment, but you'll be online after a seconds
2010-01-14T20:55:00.000Z	epinky	marcelo	you're welcome :)
