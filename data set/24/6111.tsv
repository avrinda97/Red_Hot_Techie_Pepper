2006-07-09T12:56:00.000Z	top222		I had fun using a 40MB FAT32 partition on the HD of a laptop, downloading the installer there, and then using a GRUB bootdisk to start the installer.
2006-07-09T12:58:00.000Z	top222		Then it took some hours to download all the packages from the 'net, but the end result was a working Dapper system (not including the Thinkpad-ish problems I had after that).
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		Has anyone thought about a world file for Ubuntu?
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		It means you need, let's say, 10 different programs or packages
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		They pull in some 200 dependencies
2006-07-09T13:00:00.000Z	top222		Then you remove one of those programs, but the dependencies that were there only for that program still remain
2006-07-09T13:00:00.000Z	top222		Is Aptitude a GUI for apt-get?
2006-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	top222		How do I get to use aptitude?
2006-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	top222		Thanks, I'll check that
2006-07-09T13:05:00.000Z	top222		I must admit I had quite a mess with Gentoo's world file too, by manually installing the dependencies too, one at a time.
2006-07-09T13:05:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	a "world file"? How do you propose to integrate this into apt?
2006-07-09T13:06:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	I don't think it could be integrated.  But it could be an additional functionality for Synaptic, for example.
2006-07-09T13:06:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	so how do you propose to integrate it with apt?
2006-07-09T13:07:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	A tool in a separate window where you have a) set of all installed packages, b) set of metapackages and c) set of packages not needed by these metapackages and programs.
2006-07-09T13:07:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	don't you see that if you integrate it into an apt frontend, you're simply reintroducing what aptitude does?
2006-07-09T13:07:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	the functionality needs to be developed at a lower level in the stack than the frontend.
2006-07-09T13:08:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	Does aptitude allow one to manually construct the world file, or see the changes it would cause, on a per-package basis?
2006-07-09T13:08:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	dpkg already does that, and apt extends it
2006-07-09T13:08:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	although your "world file" is fairly ambiguous here.
2006-07-09T13:09:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	It is a set of "primary" packages that are wanted for their own functionality, not because something depends on them.
2006-07-09T13:10:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	The point is the ability to specify those packages, and see all the unnecessary stale dependencies that are not needed by the specified packages.
2006-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	please let us migrate to #ubuntu-offtopic, since this is a support channel
2006-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	top222	crimsun	No... I think I'll drop my case and see if I can bring this up later somewhere else
2006-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	top222	fine by me.
