2011-08-23T18:55:00.000Z	rethus		if i start my ubuntu desktop, i never see the grub menu... but cause the startup now fail after i installed ati catalyst driver, i neet to boot into rescue mode.
2011-08-23T18:55:00.000Z	rethus		what can i do to show this grub menu?
2011-08-23T18:56:00.000Z	Onlyodin	rethus	at what point does your boot fail? Can you use Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get a login prompt?
2011-08-23T18:56:00.000Z	rethus		complete freeze ofdesktop
2011-08-23T18:57:00.000Z	rethus		it starts up, shows the root-login... if i'm be very fast, i can login... but than i see some startmessages (which are normaly also disapear before root-login promt) and system freeze
2011-08-23T18:57:00.000Z	rethus		i don't can type anything in groob... like i said... no startup
2011-08-23T18:57:00.000Z	rethus		so i need rescuemode for grup.
2011-08-23T18:58:00.000Z	rethus		sometimes if system not shutdown cleanly i see the grub-menu
2011-08-23T18:58:00.000Z	rethus		but can i garant that the grub is show at next startup?
2011-08-23T18:59:00.000Z	Onlyodin	rethus	I had a similar problem the other day, ATI proprietary driver didn't work as planned, I used Ctrl-Alt-F1 to bring up a login prompt, then ran jockey-text -d xorg:fglrx as root.
2011-08-23T18:59:00.000Z	rethus		Thanks for this hint, but didn't work for me. System freeze completly if i start in normal mode
2011-08-23T18:59:00.000Z	rethus		if i'm very very fast, i can login as root... than freeze again
2011-08-23T19:00:00.000Z	rethus		no chance to enter something else
2011-08-23T19:00:00.000Z	Onlyodin		Possibly try booting to Init/Runlevel 1 (single user mode)
2011-08-23T19:00:00.000Z	rethus	Onlyodin	how... i never see grub-screen booting up like on normal boot
2011-08-23T19:00:00.000Z	rethus		like i said... only if system shutdown unclean... the grub-menu appear
2011-08-23T19:01:00.000Z	rethus		and exactly this menu i need now
2011-08-23T19:01:00.000Z	rethus		to start resue-mode
2011-08-23T19:01:00.000Z	rethus		is there a shortcut on pc boottime to show grub
2011-08-23T19:02:00.000Z	rethus		great, thats is what i searched for
2011-08-23T19:02:00.000Z	rethus		i try it
2011-08-23T19:02:00.000Z	rethus	Onlyodin	other question: does Catalyst 11.8 works for you, or is this broken for now...  i only see a howto for ubuntu for 11.7
2011-08-23T19:03:00.000Z	rethus		but 11.8 braks my system completly
2011-08-23T19:05:00.000Z	Onlyodin	rethus	I'm not using the proprietary drivers at present.
