2008-05-24T04:40:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	modprobe | less
2008-05-24T04:40:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	and lspci
2008-05-24T04:44:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	lspci tells you what hardware the o/s sees.
2008-05-24T04:44:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	i need to know what mode is being used for that hardware
2008-05-24T04:44:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	module*
2008-05-24T04:44:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	if you need to know what option you need, you need some documentation
2008-05-24T04:45:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	i have read the modprobe man page, there is nothing about identifying hardware or PCI ID
2008-05-24T04:46:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	I can't correlate modprobe to lspci, do you know how this is done?
2008-05-24T04:47:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	use lsmod | less this will tell you whether or not a module is loaded.
2008-05-24T04:48:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	what good is a loaded module if the hardware isn't using it?
2008-05-24T04:50:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	What I'm trying to show you is there are certain commands you can use to determine whether or not the o/s sees the hardware, and whether or not drivers are loaded to use the hardware.
2008-05-24T04:50:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	it's the in-between (correlation) that i'm looking for
2008-05-24T04:50:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	once you eliminate these factors of the o/s, you can further troubleshoot.
2008-05-24T04:52:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	I don't understand what factors i have to eliminate, i just understand "Card" + "Module" = "Working", I know the card and it's PCI ID, I know 2 or three drivers it COULD be using, i need to confirm which one itt IS using
2008-05-24T04:52:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	dmesg | less
2008-05-24T04:54:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	ubuntu's in need of a Device Manager
2008-05-24T04:55:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	this doesn't really help me, it's quite verbose and not containing any searchable keywords relating to the hardware OR the module
2008-05-24T04:57:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	dmesg will tell you what hardware the o/s detects.  lspci will confirm that the hardware is detected at runtime, lsmod will tell you what is running, and what modules depend on what.  Use that information to determine what modules are driving what hardware.   In the end, my question is, what hardware is not working like you think it should be?
2008-05-24T04:59:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=801387  i just loaded the rt73 module but I don't know if it's using the module that was used at auto detection or if it's using rt73
2008-05-24T05:00:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	all you need to do is examine the output of lsmod | less
2008-05-24T05:02:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	thanks: it was lsmod, which correlates with the name on dmesg
2008-05-24T05:03:00.000Z	rickyfingers	komputes	no problemo dude.  device drivers are always a pain in the a$$
2008-05-24T05:04:00.000Z	komputes	rickyfingers	i hear that!
