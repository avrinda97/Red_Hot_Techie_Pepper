2006-11-21T07:28:00.000Z	stalefries	cmweb	i think your computer with the firewall needs to be set up as a router, ie, have 2 network cards, 1 for in, 1 for out

2006-11-21T07:30:00.000Z	cmweb	stalefries	belive it or not but Firestarter is talking me through the process of shaarring i got to do a command "apt-get install dhcp" then go
