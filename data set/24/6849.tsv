2005-07-01T12:16:00.000Z	NathanHome	mejobloggs	was saying sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start prints absolutely nothing (so its silently dying inside apache2 init script)
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	mejobloggs		yes, that guy knows more than me :)
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	NathanHome	mejobloggs	work down the list i guess
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	mejobloggs		thanks NathanHome
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	NathanHome	mejobloggs	ls -l /usr/sbin/apache2
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	NathanHome		check it exists and is executable
2005-07-01T12:17:00.000Z	mejobloggs		no such file...
2005-07-01T12:18:00.000Z	NathanHome		if you didnt typo it, sounds like a corrupted installation
2005-07-01T12:18:00.000Z	mejobloggs		i copy pasted
2005-07-01T12:18:00.000Z	mejobloggs		ok, so i re-install?
2005-07-01T12:19:00.000Z	NathanHome	mejobloggs	yeh check which packages you have installed to
2005-07-01T12:20:00.000Z	mejobloggs		i just do that using 'Add/Remove Programs' ?
2005-07-01T12:21:00.000Z	mejobloggs		ok, i went to Advanced, clicked on Networking, then selected 'apache2-common'
2005-07-01T12:22:00.000Z	mejobloggs		Also, i have got rid of all the internet repositories, and just kept the CD one
2005-07-01T12:23:00.000Z	mejobloggs		so, if there are any things that are needed that are not on the CD, i guess it wont work, but I am not able to use the internet repositories
2005-07-01T12:26:00.000Z	mejobloggs	NathanHome	did you understand what i said?
2005-07-01T12:27:00.000Z	NathanHome	mejobloggs	try right click and 'reinstall'
