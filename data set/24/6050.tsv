2006-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	farous	stjepan	just curious what is xcomposite?
2006-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	cool xorg feature
2006-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	stjepan		:)
2006-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	stjepan		transparent windows and cool shadows... very fancy
2006-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	farous		oh would love to get that :) have same card here
2006-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	stjepan		heh
2006-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	do you use the fglrx driver?
2006-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	farous		yap
2006-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	stjepan		It IS possible to get xcomposite working with fglrx driver, but you will get just a mess on the screen :)
2006-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	stjepan		you can use new testing xorg radeon driver
2006-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	farous	stjepan	is it like xgl
2006-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	stjepan		from xorg-x11-7
2006-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	whats xgl? :)
2006-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	farous		thanx apokryphos
2006-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	it is possible to get xcomposite working with xorg driver, but it will be still quite slow
2006-02-21T07:25:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	the best option is to use an older radeon card, or just buy nvidia :(
2006-02-21T07:25:00.000Z	stjepan		!help
2006-02-21T07:25:00.000Z	farous		too hard to do that now i run it on my notebook stjepan
2006-02-21T07:26:00.000Z	farous		thanx apokryphos was looking hi and low for the link but could not find it
2006-02-21T07:26:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	then it is hard to get xcomposite working for you (and me) :(
2006-02-21T07:27:00.000Z	farous	stjepan	wait and it will be available. Be patient
2006-02-21T07:27:00.000Z	stjepan	farous	:D maybe I will be dead before they release a new driver with xcomposite support
2006-02-21T07:28:00.000Z	farous	stjepan	wait for xgl on dapper
