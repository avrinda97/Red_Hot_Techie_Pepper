2010-02-28T17:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	abhi_nav	for home folder encription ecryptfs is used
2010-02-28T17:22:00.000Z	abhi_nav	erUSUL	not for home folder. its just one of the folder e.g. /home/abc/desktop/test
2010-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	abhi_nav	it can be any folder. i'm saying what ubuntu uses for the home encription i case you want to use the same
2010-02-28T17:24:00.000Z	abhi_nav	erUSUL	i want to share my home folder with frends. but want to lock that only one folder. all other folder wll be accesd.
2010-02-28T17:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	abhi_nav	it is better to create a third folder to share things and leave your home folder to you
2010-02-28T17:25:00.000Z	abhi_nav	erUSUL	i dont mean network sharing. just want to lock a specific folder with password
2010-02-28T17:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	abhi_nav	i undesrtand. but your home folder has your configuration files etc... trust me it is easier and safer to just create a /home/shared folder to share the things you want to share with other users
2010-02-28T17:27:00.000Z	abhi_nav	erUSUL	ok tell me can i have a script or something like that which wll delete my specific unpreviledge account if i dont open that unpreviledged account for 'n' number of days? can i write such scritp by my own? is it availabve already?
