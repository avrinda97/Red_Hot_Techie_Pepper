2005-10-15T15:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	is mozilla 'frozen' ?
2005-10-15T15:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	you can do this command-line: ps aux |grep mozilla
2005-10-15T15:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	then kill all the PID's the are listed
2005-10-15T15:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	e.g. -> kill -9 <pid#?> <pid#>
2005-10-15T15:20:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	See pm
2005-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	where is the commandline
2005-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	you should always ask before you PM - that's "etiquette" :-)
2005-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	do not whine
2005-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	invoke a terminal (right-click, terminal)
2005-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	take good advice when it is offered
2005-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	since you need us more than we need you =)
2005-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	do you want to help or humiliate me ?
2005-10-15T15:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	I'm trying to help, and educate -- that's all
2005-10-15T15:24:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	I typed ps aux |grep mozilla in task in New Starter
2005-10-15T15:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	good news - there are no rogue mozilla processes then
2005-10-15T15:25:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	so what's the problem then ?
2005-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	what do you want to do that you cannot then?
2005-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	ok it worked
2005-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	it's gone
2005-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	there ya go :-)
2005-10-15T15:27:00.000Z	apoZ`	Xenguy	 ah no , it's still there :(
2005-10-15T15:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	what is still there?
2005-10-15T15:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	that does not describe the problem though
2005-10-15T15:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	apoZ`	that was the GUI way - glad it worked
