2010-12-30T02:07:00.000Z	Shadowolf		Just updated. Can't login and it won't give me a GUI.
2010-12-30T02:08:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	have you tried logging in as root, and then startx?
2010-12-30T02:09:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	I got it to tty, and have finally logged in.
2010-12-30T02:11:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	just type startx
2010-12-30T02:12:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	"Fatal server error: no screens found"
2010-12-30T02:14:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	ok, then you have something bigger than I know how to fix. you need to reinstall the driver for your monitor. the new kernel disabled it. so you need to look at the contents of /etc/modules and add a line in there that declares your monitor type
2010-12-30T02:15:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	it could also be in your bootloader though. to help, i need more knowledge maybe someone else in here can help. but we need to know your architecture
2010-12-30T02:16:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	one thing you may try, is X could be the problem, so try sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2010-12-30T02:17:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	then try to startx, if it doesn't work, put it all back the way it was by sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-12-30T02:18:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	will try that in a second.
2010-12-30T02:19:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	I think you are right. For some reason it is confused about my driver, a version conflict.
2010-12-30T02:22:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	it sas there is no such file or directory.
2010-12-30T02:26:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	did you capitalize the X in X11?
2010-12-30T02:28:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	im not sure if disabling X is going to help if you found a driver conflict. you need to add a line in the file /etc/modules that says your videocard type
2010-12-30T02:29:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	for me its an ati radeon 9200, so i had to put in the line radeon.apg.modeset=1 or something like that
2010-12-30T02:30:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	"Error: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module  has version 173.14.28, but this NVIDIA driver componenet has version 260.19.21. Please make sure that the kernel module and all NVIDIA driver ocmponents have the same version.
2010-12-30T02:30:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	that line i just mentioned was in my bootloader, and in modules it was ati-7784 something or other. but at any rate, you need to override the kernel with lines in those two files that are specific for YOUR videocard
2010-12-30T02:31:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	are you on powerpc?
2010-12-30T02:32:00.000Z	Shadowolf	magicjoe	no, P4
2010-12-30T02:33:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	just checking. don't use the exact line i used, i was just telling you the file you need to change. i don't know the line to add. you need to find the one that is for your video card
2010-12-30T02:36:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	you might try using what i have mentioned in a google search with your video card in there. chances are, someone else had the same problem when they updated, and have solved it. so search for "add this line to /etc/modules +your videocard"
2010-12-30T02:37:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	sudo gedit filename
2010-12-30T02:38:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	wait, no you have no gui!
2010-12-30T02:38:00.000Z	magicjoe	Shadowolf	sudo pico filename. or sudo vi filename
