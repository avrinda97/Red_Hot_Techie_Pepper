2007-07-18T14:28:00.000Z	syntux		any idea how display file permissions in number with ls -l ?
2007-07-18T14:29:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	you can't just glance at it and convert?
2007-07-18T14:29:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	why I can't?
2007-07-18T14:30:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	no I mean, what is the point, can't you read the permissions and quickly convert to octal
2007-07-18T14:31:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	no, I'm not fluent at it else I wouldnt think of that
2007-07-18T14:31:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	do you understand how the numbers work?
2007-07-18T14:32:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	not all but hmm, where can I read about the text and numbers
2007-07-18T14:32:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	I read somewhere once that was very helpful but do you know binary?
2007-07-18T14:33:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	no but I'd love to learn.
2007-07-18T14:34:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	ok well decimal which you are probably familiar with counts up to 9, then starts over at 0, well binary is like that except it counts up to 1 and then starts over at 0
2007-07-18T14:34:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	so it goes 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000
2007-07-18T14:34:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	once you get to one you carry over
2007-07-18T14:35:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	does that make sense?
2007-07-18T14:35:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	lol not much
2007-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	it took me a while to get it, you are used to counting up from 1 to 9, and then starting back over at 0 right?
2007-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	right
2007-07-18T14:38:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	well instead of starting over at 9, you start over at 1, so here is decimal side by side with binary 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 10, 3  == 11, 4 == 100, 5 = 101, 6 = 110, 7 = 111
2007-07-18T14:40:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	didn't get it :(
2007-07-18T14:40:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	 how are you counting it ?
2007-07-18T14:43:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	maybe there is a better explanation online, maybe thinking about this will make you better understand, why do we go to 9 and then start over? why not go to 4 and then start over? so then it would go 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 14 20
2007-07-18T14:44:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	cool, then why 7 = 111 ?
2007-07-18T14:45:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	just start counting up, everytime you get to carry over into the next column, like in decimal you would get to 9 and then carry over into the next column to the left, do the same thing but do it at 1, you will see that the seventh digit you come up with is 111
2007-07-18T14:46:00.000Z	syntux	bruenig	thank you :-) I guess I should read more about it and maybe I should buy a binary watch.
2007-07-18T14:48:00.000Z	bruenig	syntux	ok well once you understand binary, just think about permissions like this, rwx = 111 because they are all full, 110 would be rw- because you see the last one is empty, so since 7 = 111 and 111 = rwx, chmod 7 means chmod it to rwx
