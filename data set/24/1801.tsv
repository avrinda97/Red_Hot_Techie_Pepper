2009-08-23T19:17:00.000Z	xax		hi. ever since Ubuntu 9.04, kernel 2.6.28-13-generic, I only see noise on my screen right after the splash screen. I can hear sound and I can even log in (blindly), but the whole screen is filled with garbage. this problem didn't come up in and before 2.6.28-11-generic. I have an ATI card. is this a known problem?
2009-08-23T19:19:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	Hmmmm.....sounds like a compiz or gdm problem that
2009-08-23T19:20:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	Just finished sorting out my graphic display issue on my desktop with my NVidia 9600GT card
2009-08-23T19:20:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	isn't compix loaded *after* I log in? please correct me if I'm wrong. and what did you do to get your card working again?
2009-08-23T19:20:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	You have an active iternet connection?
2009-08-23T19:21:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	yes.
2009-08-23T19:21:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	So you dont see the log in screen at all?
2009-08-23T19:22:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	I basically un-installed all compiz packages. You using gdm?
2009-08-23T19:22:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	right, I only see garbage that moves when I move my mouse.
2009-08-23T19:22:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	This before or after log in screen?
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	Can you open a virtual prompt?
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	Ctrl+Alt+F2 at log in
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	yes. it's right after the splash screen and before the login window appears. and I can switch to other terminals with CTRL+ALT+FX.
2009-08-23T19:23:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	What type of internet connection you got?
2009-08-23T19:24:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	DSL.
2009-08-23T19:25:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	I only had problems with gdm, cause compiz was still using the old intel graphics driver from my laptop....it was a cloned live-cd that I used to install Ubuntu on my desktop
2009-08-23T19:26:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	What you wanna do is log in on a virtual prompt, and try and cd to your error logs for xorg
2009-08-23T19:27:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	should be /var/log
2009-08-23T19:27:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	I'll do this next time I reboot. good idea. thank you :)
2009-08-23T19:27:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	And maybe try and set the display config to vesa
2009-08-23T19:28:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	Pastebin the output of the xorg.log file
2009-08-23T19:28:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	And if you find a lot of them, just delete the xorg.log files, it will create a new one
2009-08-23T19:28:00.000Z	linuxson25	xax	when you try and boot up again
2009-08-23T19:28:00.000Z	xax	linuxson25	okay. :)
