2009-03-31T05:45:00.000Z	NoobGuest		guest290342: thank you but I do not have an issue with grub.
2009-03-31T05:47:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	do it manually ?
2009-03-31T05:47:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	wont accept.
2009-03-31T05:47:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	expand on that " won't accept "
2009-03-31T05:50:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	ok so bios post says "primary hard drive not there" ?
2009-03-31T05:50:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	when post says stuff, it's pre-GRUB
2009-03-31T05:50:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	effectively yes. Right.
2009-03-31T05:51:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	MBR can be anylzed by me using testdisc
2009-03-31T05:52:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	Guest 290342: Solutions?
2009-03-31T05:52:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	well for starters, did you change stuff in your hardware setup ?
2009-03-31T05:53:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	new hardware, reconnected hard drives, jumpers changed ? all the motherboards I ever had are incredibly retarded with PATA setups, INCREDIBLY
2009-03-31T05:54:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	SMART check, full-lenghtl ong test can take up to 1 hour (mine takes 30 minutes)
2009-03-31T05:54:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	manufacturer gives you some tools you can download
2009-03-31T05:55:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	well, pre-OS tools
2009-03-31T05:55:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	tools that boot before operating system
2009-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	except it's pre-OS boot
2009-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	it's on a live cd
2009-03-31T05:56:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	Good to know also, ty.
2009-03-31T05:57:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	so you're not executing it from inside an operatin system (like windows or ubuntu), it's before they even load
2009-03-31T05:57:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	once you do that (I doubt that's the problem though), you can move to other possible vectors of problems
2009-03-31T05:58:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	NoobGuest	no prob, you won't really do it but you might remember it one day, when thing really go weird :P
2009-03-31T05:58:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	haha. I think i will try it because I am trying to fix this. I don't like problems I cant fix especially with electronics.
2009-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	NoobGuest	Mean_Admin	logout will take me terminal only?
