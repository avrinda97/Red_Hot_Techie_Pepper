2008-04-30T12:48:00.000Z	tau	axion	Master File Table
2008-04-30T12:48:00.000Z	axion	tau	noboby's answering you because that's a stupid question
2008-04-30T12:49:00.000Z	tau	axion	is it, and how am I supposed to install ubuntu when I can only shrink the NTFS volume by 7MB?  yow
2008-04-30T12:50:00.000Z	tau	axion	may I ask how you installed ubuntu?
2008-04-30T12:50:00.000Z	axion	tau	empty drive..
2008-04-30T12:50:00.000Z	tau	axion	not all of us have that luxury :(
2008-04-30T12:51:00.000Z	tau	axion	already done, but like I said I can't install it so long as the MFT is in the way
2008-04-30T12:53:00.000Z	tau	axion	yes, I have tried with numeroes different programs, but none of them will move the MFT!
2008-04-30T12:54:00.000Z	tau	axion	it's very frustrating
2008-04-30T12:54:00.000Z	tau	axion	it's not actually my system, I'm helping a friend - he is running XP SP2, with a single core pentium, I think it's like 2.6Ghz or something
2008-04-30T12:56:00.000Z	tau	axion	I will run those suggestions past him, but I think he wants to use his existing drive
2008-04-30T12:56:00.000Z	tau	axion	thanks anyway
2008-04-30T12:57:00.000Z	tau	axion	nope, well there is an external, but it is full
2008-04-30T12:59:00.000Z	tau	axion	okay, I don't know if he's interested in that (no money to spend) but I'll mention it
2008-04-30T13:02:00.000Z	tau	axion	ok, I'll mention that too, but I'm pretty sure he already did that - we've read a bunch of different things from different sites but nothing seems to help :(
2008-04-30T13:04:00.000Z	tau	axion	not enough room to do that either, it seems he's just gonna have to back up and reformat, what a pain..  so much for installing ubuntu being easy
2008-04-30T13:05:00.000Z	tau	axion	yup
2008-04-30T13:06:00.000Z	tau	axion	there is about 15GB of free space, but there are unmovable files at the end of the drive prefenting gparted shrinking the partition
2008-04-30T13:07:00.000Z	tau	axion	I thought you couldn't boot to a partition on an external drive?
2008-04-30T13:08:00.000Z	tau	axion	ok, that might work!  I'll run it past him.. thanks
2008-04-30T13:10:00.000Z	tau	axion	the most he can shrink the volume is 7MB !
2008-04-30T13:11:00.000Z	tau	axion	ok
2008-04-30T13:20:00.000Z	tau	axion	thanks for your help.. cya
