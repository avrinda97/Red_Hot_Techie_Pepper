2008-07-08T02:22:00.000Z	idx		So I'm not using Ubuntu anymore. It worked fine until about two months ago, possibly after an update, after which it failed to recognise my Buffalo Wireless-G USB Adapter which had been working perfectly beforehand. Ideas, please?
2008-07-08T02:23:00.000Z	idx		But I can't, since I cannot access the internet within it
2008-07-08T02:24:00.000Z	idx		I thought it was an intermittant fault with the adapter. But it works fine in Windows
2008-07-08T02:26:00.000Z	idx		Any ideas regarding my Buffalo Wireless-G USB adapter not workin? I've searched the forum, there are posts but no answers.
2008-07-08T02:28:00.000Z	__yy	idx	just telling us it's not working really doesn't give enough information to help you. Does ifconfig ssay you have an IP? Does iwconfig show you connected to a network?
2008-07-08T02:29:00.000Z	idx	__yy	Obviously, I'm not in Ubuntu right now.
2008-07-08T02:29:00.000Z	__yy	idx	yes, that makes it very hard to help you
2008-07-08T02:30:00.000Z	__yy	idx	ok, do you have the specific error
2008-07-08T02:30:00.000Z	idx	__yy	No, just that "no network connection is present"
2008-07-08T02:30:00.000Z	idx	__yy	Or something. Two computers and a red cross where the wireless indicator should be.
2008-07-08T02:31:00.000Z	idx	__yy	Lights do appear when it boots. But Ubuntu rejects it before it comes up with the log in screen
2008-07-08T02:32:00.000Z	__yy	idx	I don't use gnome, so what the gui shows doesn't mean anything to me. Try starting ubuntu and doing 'ifconfig yournetworkdevice' to see if you have an IP, and then 'iwconfig yournetworkdevice' and check if essid is set to the name of your network device.
2008-07-08T02:32:00.000Z	__yy	idx	essid is set to the name of your wireless network, sorry, not device
2008-07-08T02:36:00.000Z	idx	__yy	If the essid is wrong, what then?
2008-07-08T02:36:00.000Z	__yy	idx	then you're trying to connect to the wrong network.
2008-07-08T02:36:00.000Z	__yy	idx	try 'sudo iwconfig yournetworkdevice essid yourwirelessnetwork; sudo dhclient yournetworkdevice'
2008-07-08T02:38:00.000Z	__yy	idx	you mean ubuntu isn't recongnizing your NIC?
2008-07-08T02:41:00.000Z	idx	__yy	I'm not sure, all I know that after boot it is almost as if my adapter isn't plugged in.
2008-07-08T02:41:00.000Z	__yy	idx	so it doesn't show up in ifconfig at all?
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	__yy	idx	you can download the ubuntu CD's and use them
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	idx	__yy	And they have all the latest updates?
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	__yy	idx	a new CD should be pretty close, it might not be bleeding edge though
2008-07-08T02:44:00.000Z	idx	__yy	Well I have 8.04, but you're saying that the lastest iso might be 8.06+updates?
2008-07-08T02:45:00.000Z	__yy	idx	That should work... but I've never tried updating via CD, so I really don't know anything about it beyond that it should be possible.
