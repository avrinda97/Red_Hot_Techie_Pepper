2007-03-21T06:09:00.000Z	FITorion		hi everyone.... so I need to figure out how to mount a hard drive....
2007-03-21T06:11:00.000Z	FITorion		I have a raid array that doesn't seem to be being detected...
2007-03-21T06:11:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	any kernel messages?
2007-03-21T06:12:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	and "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" or whatever doesn't work?
2007-03-21T06:13:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	you might try "dmesg | grep -i raid" and see what device name turns up
2007-03-21T06:14:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	it greps the log printed at boot for any output regarding a raid array. this could tell you what device name the kernel is using to refer to the device
2007-03-21T06:17:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	how have you configured this raid? describe the device
2007-03-21T06:21:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	and this raid is connected to your computer how?
2007-03-21T06:22:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	so you have a separate sata card plugged into the machine, or?
2007-03-21T06:23:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	and the device driver module is loaded in the kernel?
2007-03-21T06:24:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	do you know the device driver name? which make is the raid controller?
2007-03-21T06:25:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	you'll need to be sure :-)
2007-03-21T06:26:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	right, but the controller should have a chipset, which should be listed in your motherboard manual
2007-03-21T06:30:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	k, you'll need to do some googling and figure out which driver is needed for this controller chipset
2007-03-21T06:30:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	just "NVIDIA mediashield linux ubuntu" should turn up some hits
2007-03-21T06:45:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	running the .exe won't do you any good, i'm afraid
2007-03-21T06:45:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	but if you can find the driver name in linux, it's probably already supported
2007-03-21T06:46:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	let me see what i can dig up. also, be sure to include my handle if you want me to read your future replies
2007-03-21T06:47:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	i need more information
2007-03-21T06:53:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	what was the name again, mediaguard?
2007-03-21T06:53:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	k, i'll ahve a look
2007-03-21T06:56:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	are you sure medaishield is the name of the chipset from the motherboard?
2007-03-21T07:01:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	unfortunately i'm out of time at the moment, and i can't dig up a device driver name. i suggest you look through the drivers in /lib/modules/ and see if you can find something similar to what is listed in your documentation, and then load that with insmod <filename>
2007-03-21T07:01:00.000Z	sipior	FITorion	good luck to you
