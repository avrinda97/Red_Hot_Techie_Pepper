2007-12-17T11:49:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	heh, same card I have
2007-12-17T11:49:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	does it work for you? :-/
2007-12-17T11:50:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	yep, both on ubuntu (automatic) and gentoo, (I manually configured it)
2007-12-17T11:50:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	doesn't work for me :-/
2007-12-17T11:51:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	alright, hang on a moment let me get my settings for you
2007-12-17T11:51:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	please.
2007-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	gutsy
2007-12-17T11:53:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	it doesn't for me
2007-12-17T11:54:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	I mean, the card gets detected and everything.
2007-12-17T11:54:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	it even connects to the AP
2007-12-17T11:54:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	alright, open a terminal
2007-12-17T11:54:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	but it won't get an IP from the DHCP server
2007-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	sounds like you don't have dhcpcd
2007-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	dhcp client is there.
2007-12-17T11:56:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	please open a terminal, and type in iwlist eth1 scan
2007-12-17T11:56:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	if you can scan using the card, then the problem is not the card :)
2007-12-17T11:56:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	I can scan, yes.
2007-12-17T11:57:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	are you able to connect to an accesspoint?
2007-12-17T11:57:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	yup.
2007-12-17T11:57:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	but it eventually fails.
2007-12-17T11:57:00.000Z	Znuff	Eagle-101	hit the connect, it's telling me its connecting then it fails
2007-12-17T11:58:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	better, please put the output of iwlist eth1 scan into a pastebin?
2007-12-17T12:01:00.000Z	Eagle-101	Znuff	the card works, seems like you have problems with your network key. I know the card works because I have the exact same thing working in two different linux operating systems.
