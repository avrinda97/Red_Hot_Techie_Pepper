2006-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	bosco		how do i  (in termanal) add more desktops i dont have the apply button for adding more
2006-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	you mean the apply button in synaptec? (adding more desktops being adding more... whats? like kubuntu?)
2006-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	 i am running ubuntu and e17 but they told me to come here and i just neet to know some commands to do though terminal
2006-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	what are you trying to do through the terminal though?
2006-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	i am trying to add more desktops to my 4 that i already have i have not started i need to know how to start then i should be good
2006-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	from there
2006-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	which GUI? gnome? KDE? enlightenment?
2006-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	e17
2006-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	is e17 enlightenment?
2006-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	 yes
2006-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	wouldn't that be an enlightenment specific thing then?  I mean, I can google, but, they'd be the ones to tell you which file to change.  We could tell you where we've MOVED that file, heh, but...
2006-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	why are you interested in doing this via the command line? out of pure curiosity as I google.
2006-03-06T07:00:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	 I need to know because in e17 there is a graphical user interface for it but it has no apply button to add more desktops like it should and because it is the latest and unstable e17 there is now way around it
2006-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	so, why are you asking in #ubuntu? if it's regarding an enlightenment bug?  I would think of all people, they'd be able to help.  Enlightenment has crappy documentation on their site, by the way.
2006-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	first off, did you report it as a bug?
2006-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	 no i did not and they told me that since i was running ubuntu that there is a file specific to ubuntu that messes with tha
2006-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	e17 isn't in ubuntu.  How did you install it?  tarball/whatever?
2006-03-06T07:08:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	how'd you get e17 installed?
2006-04-14T13:09:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	you'll be fine/better on *nix (ubuntu is a *nix)
2006-04-23T10:48:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bosco	it does use gnome, the differences aren't major.
2006-04-23T10:49:00.000Z	bosco	FlannelKing	 so then it is deffinatly worth the upgrade
