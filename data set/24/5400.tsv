2010-05-22T07:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	I don't know what problem you have, your not being clear
2010-05-22T07:28:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	when i upgrade my ubuntu to 9.04 the screen to login to ubuntu is not coming up
2010-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	do you understand me?
2010-05-22T07:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	ok log in screen is not showing, when your on which version?
2010-05-22T07:30:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	when i am on version 9.04 it does not work. I don't know how to reverse the upgrade, so , i installed another ubuntu OS on top of windows.  the screen does not answer back after some minimal loading
2010-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	if you been upgarding from 9.04 and now have a problem.  Maybe just clean install 10.04,  since you won't have Ext4 file system or Grub 2 anyway.
2010-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	What do you mean on top of Windows?
2010-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	that was going to be my last option, because i have alot installed
2010-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	ubuntu installed from windows
2010-05-22T07:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	ok you used Wubi?
2010-05-22T07:32:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	i think i did :)
2010-05-22T07:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	Ok so you don't have a proper partitoined install that was made after you booted your computer from the Live CD?
2010-05-22T07:35:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	i do have a small perfect partition working enough to try to fix my main ubuntu paritition.  I can boot to terminal with networking capabilites.  Should i try to upgrade from terminal to 10.04? and what is the code for that?
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	i am going to attempt to upgrade my ubuntu from terminal to 10.04.  maybe with the upgrade i can fix the screen resolution or screen not showing problem
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	uhmm
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	abe	sebsebseb	I will write update-manager -d
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	as for the log in screen
2010-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	you could re install, or try another
2010-05-22T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	abe	Is your main Ubuntu install a partitioned install or Wubi?
