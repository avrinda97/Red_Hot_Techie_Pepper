2004-11-22T09:54:00.000Z	mirak		but it will work for sure
2004-11-22T09:54:00.000Z	mirak		kde will maybe be a bit laggy
2004-11-22T09:55:00.000Z	mirak		ah sorry there is not kde on ubuntu :D
2004-11-22T09:55:00.000Z	mirak		I installed debian on a power mac 120mhz 64mo of ram
2004-11-22T09:57:00.000Z	mirak		than from a PC
2004-11-22T09:57:00.000Z	aim1159	mirak	what the sense to use debian on G3 instead of Classic MacOS 9?
2004-11-22T10:01:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	???
2004-11-22T10:01:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	if you would have suggested OS X instead of OS 9 well maybe
2004-11-22T10:02:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	in fact the official reason is that I don't have OS 9 licence
2004-11-22T10:02:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	nor OS X
2004-11-22T10:02:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	because my neighoburg gave the mac
2004-11-22T10:03:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	so I installed linux on it first. Then I recently installed OS X.
2004-11-22T10:07:00.000Z	aim1159	mirak	mmm... it's strange. I though all Mac hardware came with MacOS pre-installed with the licence of cause. And the licence could not be separete from the installed os...
2004-11-22T10:09:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	I had this discussion on #macosx
2004-11-22T10:09:00.000Z	aim1159	mirak	and?
2004-11-22T10:09:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	I have licence for OS 9 then
2004-11-22T10:10:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	how do you know ?
2004-11-22T10:10:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	os x runs fine on it, I don't see the problem
2004-11-22T10:11:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	even expose is working
2004-11-22T10:11:00.000Z	aim1159	mirak	mmm... it's too slow for me. osx on g4 runs much smoother
2004-11-22T10:11:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	that's not as fluid than on a G5, but that's still better than any expose like on windows or linux
2004-11-22T10:11:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	then give me your g4
2004-11-22T10:12:00.000Z	aim1159	mirak	it's not mine. it's a spbu's mac
2004-11-22T10:12:00.000Z	mirak	aim1159	anyway I run linux on it most of the time. I installed OS X not as a necessity, but more to just try it
