2008-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	moldy		when using ubuntu stable, can i do automatic updates per cronjob, or is this not advisable?
2008-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	update manager will alert you when new stuff is available, daily normally
2008-07-22T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	you can then chose if you want to download them or not
2008-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	i know, but i am not sitting at all my machines daily or even weekly
2008-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	is the machine on 24x7 ?
2008-07-22T14:28:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	yes
2008-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	what is the machines use
2008-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	server
2008-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	is it a server install or a desktop install, and does it "serve" important stuff ?
2008-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	it's a desktop install and serves not very important stuff
2008-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	basically, my question is "how high is the risk for an automatic update breaking something"
2008-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	cool, so if it randomly reboots for things like Xorg updates and kernel updates, thats not a big deal
2008-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	pretty slim
2008-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	updates reboot the machine without user interaction?
2008-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	if you set it to auto update yes, your accepting kernel updates - it needs to reboot
2008-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	oh, that is cool. i could just schedule the update for night times, when the machine is not used. how do i enable auto updates? i would just have written a shell script that runs apt-get upgrade...
2008-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	2 minutes, I think I have a document that does that, there are better ways than "apt-get update"
2008-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	thanks
2008-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	2 minutes to see if I can dig it out
2008-07-22T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	I can't find the document yet - still looking
2008-07-22T14:45:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	thanks -- take your time, it's not that important :)
2008-07-22T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	moldy	this isn't the document I was looking for but does give some excellent information and links and explains why there is no official "tool" to do this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/auto-update-blueprint
2008-07-22T15:01:00.000Z	moldy	ikonia	ok, thank you
