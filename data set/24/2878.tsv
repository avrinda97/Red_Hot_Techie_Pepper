2010-07-30T14:10:00.000Z	kasi		i have gnome-media, but I don't have the volume control applet. How come?
2010-07-30T14:11:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	you need the indicator-applet
2010-07-30T14:11:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	I don't have that executable
2010-07-30T14:13:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	I have /usr/lib/indicator-applet/ but I don't have anything in a bin directory
2010-07-30T14:14:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	you need to add the applet to one of your panels
2010-07-30T14:14:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	that's where the volume-applet hooks itself these days
2010-07-30T14:14:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	the problem is that it doesn't show up in the "add to panel" list

2010-07-30T14:15:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	The notify applet doesnt? I run swedish locale, but it shows as something like "notification area" for me
2010-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	oh. who would have thought that the 'volume indicator' is called 'notificator'
2010-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	I have it now
2010-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	it's not just for volume, various other apps hook into the notification area as well
2010-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	I see now, it also lists email
2010-07-30T14:17:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	yep :)
2010-07-30T14:19:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	do you also know an app, that let's me switch between differen audio output channels (e.g., switch from internal sound to the headset and back?)
2010-07-30T14:20:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	the normal volume applet should let you do that
2010-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	Settings -> output
2010-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	yes, but I need to go into the audio settings
2010-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	ah you mean like a quick switch
2010-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	I was looking for a simple applet that let's one easily switch
2010-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	kasi		yes
2010-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	well ideally, it should do that automatically when you insert headphones, but sometimes it doesnt detect the switch getting triggered... I think there's some workarounds/fixes for that
2010-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	hateball	kasi	But to answer the question, no I dont know of a dedicated app to do it
2010-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	kasi	hateball	thanks
