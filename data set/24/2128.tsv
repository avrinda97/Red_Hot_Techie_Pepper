2009-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	what problem do you have with urxvt
2009-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	using it right now
2009-04-27T02:20:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	it doesnt show my utf8 chars right
2009-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	probably a font problem? i use profont font and it works great
2009-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	urxvt*font: -*-profont-*-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
2009-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	in my ~/.Xdefaults
2009-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	i am dumping the source of a url that is windows-1253 encoded
2009-04-27T02:22:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	do i need to install it first? or is it included by def?
2009-04-27T02:22:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	no look for it on google unfortunately it's not included
2009-04-27T02:23:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	also look for a guide on how to install the font files, this one (http://www.fluidscape.co.nz/node/92) does wonders - just forget that emacs bit and use vim :D
2009-04-27T02:25:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	i think urxvt uses profont by default
2009-04-27T02:26:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	really? strange
2009-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	i installed it like 10 days ago and it showed the common fugly xterm font
2009-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	you're right
2009-04-27T02:28:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	check with the 0, the 1 and the {}, in profont the 0 is slashed, the 1 is different from lowercase L and the parentheses are taller for more visibility
2009-04-27T02:28:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	pretty useful stuff if you use the terminal a lot
2009-04-27T02:30:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	i use it very much. thank you!:D
2009-04-27T02:30:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	it must be the font
2009-04-27T02:31:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	is utf working with profont?
2009-04-27T02:31:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	idk gonna try in a while
2009-04-27T02:31:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	k
2009-04-27T02:53:00.000Z	tommi69	ald	did profont solve your problem?
2009-04-27T02:55:00.000Z	ald	tommi69	i was away, now i will try. thanks for asking :)
