2009-05-20T16:26:00.000Z	jimi_		hello people, im just about to venture into the world of trying to get WoW to work in ubuntu. I have the website here to follow but I need to ask  one thing. It says that I can copy the WoW folder over from my windows installation, fair one, but can I do that if the installation is on another partition on the same disk as ubuntu?
2009-05-20T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	I don't see why that would matter
2009-05-20T16:27:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	how would i access it?
2009-05-20T16:27:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	to copy it over
2009-05-20T16:27:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	ty :)
2009-05-20T16:31:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	blimey that all looks a bit complicated, I have only been using Linux for about a month
2009-05-20T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	you should just have to click on your ntfs partition in nautilus.  Or use the gui ntfs-config...
2009-05-20T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	I must go now though
2009-05-20T16:32:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	ok ty :)
2010-05-08T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	chsh
2010-05-08T17:34:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	right, how do i define what the default shell is?
2010-05-08T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	you run chsh...
2010-05-08T17:35:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	yeah, it keeps defaulting to /bin/sh even after changing
2010-05-08T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	pastebin your terminal session
2010-05-08T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	wait.  /bin/sh isn't the default interactive shell anyway.
2010-05-08T17:36:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	It is when you create a new user
2010-05-08T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	how are you creating the new user?
2010-05-08T17:37:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	I already created it. I am using it now. I just want to change from /bin/sh to /bin/bash , apparently you have to logout and back in for it to take affect. I just ssh'd into myself and its bash then.
2010-05-08T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	can you please answer my question?
2010-05-08T17:38:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	no :)
2010-05-08T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	suit yourself....
2010-05-08T17:38:00.000Z	jimi_	jrib	i already fixed it
2010-05-08T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	you probably did something non-optimal
2010-10-21T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	jimi_	yes
