2008-11-10T01:28:00.000Z	Stalker72		If I want to make torrents with .iso files (like Ubuntu), what is the best place to do it?
2008-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	what do you mean? =)
2008-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	What is a good place to upload ISO torrents?
2008-11-10T01:30:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	that depends what you want to do. Most trackers already have ubuntu ISOs I think =)
2008-11-10T01:31:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I'm planning on uploading other distributions as well..
2008-11-10T01:32:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	well, most distributions have their own torrents as well.. look for them at distro's homepage. What browser do you use? =)
2008-11-10T01:33:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I use Firefox, I'm trying in Opera.
2008-11-10T01:33:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	okay
2008-11-10T01:36:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	let me know of your success with the torrents =)
2008-11-10T01:36:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	Opera is freezing atm.. :P
2008-11-10T01:37:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	Now I see colors again.. xD
2008-11-10T01:37:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	Now I just have to wait and see! ;)
2008-11-10T01:39:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	let me know if you upload anything.. I would love to share =)
2008-11-10T01:40:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I will! That's kind of you ! :)
2008-11-10T01:42:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I'm planning on uploading lesser known Linux distros too.. They are usually not available on large BitTorrent trackes like TPB
2008-11-10T01:43:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I got an error in Opera too.. :(
2008-11-10T01:44:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	aw =(
2008-11-10T01:44:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	Is there an easier and more stable way of uploading? Can I use an FTP app or something? :P
2008-11-10T01:45:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	don't know of any
2008-11-10T01:45:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	PM?
2008-11-10T01:45:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	?
2008-11-10T01:46:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	PM = personal message
2008-11-10T01:46:00.000Z	Stalker72	Fougner	I know, but how do I send a PM in XChat?
2008-11-10T01:47:00.000Z	Fougner	Stalker72	I sent one to you, just click it in the left list
