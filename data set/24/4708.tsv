2007-05-26T14:21:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	try "sudo mkdir /mounted" then "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mounted"
2007-05-26T14:21:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	idk what your slave shows as in /dev, but guessing since it's the second disk
2007-05-26T14:22:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	the one i said would mount then first partition of the second-recognized disk
2007-05-26T14:23:00.000Z	illriginal	macogw	mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist
2007-05-26T14:24:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	ok that means we have to figure out what your hard drive is being called
2007-05-26T14:24:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	can you do "ls /dev" and see whats there
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	oh you figured out what device it is?
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	ok then
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	illriginal	macogw	i have a question
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	yeah?
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	where is it mounted?
2007-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	it's probably root-owned
2007-05-26T14:26:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	sudo chown -R <yourusername>|<yourusername> <mountpoint>
2007-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	you said it's mounted.  what folder is it mounted at?
2007-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	"mountpoint" just means wherever you put it when you mounted it
2007-05-26T14:30:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	if you click it and give it your password it opens up the drive right?  click the < arrow on the top left (right above where it shows what's in the drive), then click the little pencil
2007-05-26T14:30:00.000Z	illriginal	macogw	/media/disk
2007-05-26T14:31:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	cd /media
2007-05-26T14:31:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	then ls -l
2007-05-26T14:31:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	those are both lowercase L's
2007-05-26T14:33:00.000Z	macogw	illriginal	i have to log off because i'm dist upgrading, but if that doesnt do it, then also do "sudo chmod -R 774 /media/disk"
