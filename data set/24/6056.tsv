2006-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	redblade	only way I would know would be to purge nautilus and reinstall, but you'd lose any settings you've made
2006-02-24T17:35:00.000Z	redblade		any nautilus settings?
2006-02-24T17:35:00.000Z	redblade		or any settings at all?
2006-02-24T17:36:00.000Z	jimcooncat	redblade	any nautilus settings, but they cover a lot of the environment
2006-02-24T17:36:00.000Z	redblade		that's ok
2006-02-24T17:36:00.000Z	redblade		just please tell me how
2006-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	redblade	jimcooncat	how do I purge nautilus?
2006-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	redblade		and then reinstall it?
2006-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	jimcooncat	redblade	hang on, I'm checking it out on my system so I don't tell you wrong things. patience please
2006-02-24T17:37:00.000Z	redblade		okay
2006-02-24T17:40:00.000Z	jimcooncat	redblade	in synaptic search for nautilus. when you find it right-click it, and choose "Mark for Complete Removal". If it asks to remove ubuntu-desktop that's ok. Then, if you removed ubuntu-desktop, search for that and reinstall it. If you didn't remove ubuntu-desktop, just reinstall nautilus.
2006-02-24T17:43:00.000Z	redblade	jimcooncat	I'm doing it  now
2006-02-24T17:43:00.000Z	redblade		I hope it works
2006-02-24T17:52:00.000Z	redblade	jimcooncat	there is mentioan of CORBA too
