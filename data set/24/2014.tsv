2009-05-18T20:23:00.000Z	Isopropane_		Does anyone know how this can be remedied?
2009-05-18T20:25:00.000Z	Isopropane_		...
2009-05-18T20:25:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	does your graphics adapter actually support higher resolutions?
2009-05-18T20:26:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	also check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for what X found to be supported by your hardware.
2009-05-18T20:26:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Yes, it's done this resolution before
2009-05-18T20:27:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	if it turns out it should work, you can add a ModeLine to your xorg.conf and restart X
2009-05-18T20:27:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	it can also be caused by a limitation of the driver you are currently using
2009-05-18T20:28:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	I haven't changed the driver.. what modeline should I add? The manual is rather high-level and makes little sense
2009-05-18T20:32:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	the manual is probably still the best source for this information. you can also try to generate a ModeLine here: http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl
2009-05-18T20:33:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Cheers :D I've used the generator.. where abouts do I put the output?
2009-05-18T20:39:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	into your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-18T20:39:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	please do not paste here. use a pastebin instead
2009-05-18T20:39:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	I know, but which section?
2009-05-18T20:41:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	the Device section.
2009-05-18T20:42:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Cheers :D
2009-05-18T20:42:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	actually it should go to the 'Monitor' section, sorry
2009-05-18T20:43:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Thanks :)
2009-05-18T20:54:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	That did nothing.. that made Ubuntu boot into low graphics mode where I had to re-configure the xorg.conf
2009-05-18T20:56:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	that'S a pity... :-/
2009-05-18T20:57:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	best read up more on this specific driver / kernel module you're using and the options it provides then
2009-05-18T20:59:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Okay
2009-05-18T21:00:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	Thanks anyway :)
2009-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	Piet	Isopropane_	you're welcome
2009-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	Isopropane_	Piet	What section did it paste into again? I lost the backlog when I restarted X. I put a value in wrong
