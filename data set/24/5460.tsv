2006-07-07T10:21:00.000Z	dbmata		hey, is anyone here comfortable troubleshooting an nvidia driver install issue?
2006-07-07T10:21:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	did you install the ubuntu packages?  did you follow the wiki page?
2006-07-07T10:22:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	I did follow the wiki page, and I would like to say yes to having installed the ubuntu packages, but I'm not sure.
2006-07-07T10:23:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	as long as you didn't use a download from nvidia.com
2006-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	right, I didn't, I used synaptic. When I try to run the -config enable, I get an error.
2006-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	what's the error?
2006-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	want me to paste the error, or give the shorthand?
2006-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	pastebin please
2006-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	dbmata@stigmata:~$ sudo nvidia-glx-config disable
2006-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	?? that I don't know... I definitely didn't want what happened though.
2006-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	okay, well that's fairly self-explanatory.  Go ahead and change nv to nvidia manually
2006-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	next time use pastebin please ;)
2006-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	just got the link to a pastebin page. Never heard of it before, sorry.
2006-07-07T10:27:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	no problem
2006-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	since I'm not sure how to actually manually edit anything, is there a walk through in the wiki?
2006-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-07-07T10:30:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	what do you know. Thank you. Sorry for the flooding. (I haven't been this confused by an os since my first jump into DOS back in the day.)
2006-07-07T10:30:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	you'll learn.  In fact, it's easier than windows, so you'll have no troubles.  :)
2006-07-07T10:31:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	I like it much better than my failed attempt at debian a couple years back.
2006-07-07T10:32:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	glad to hear that :)
2006-07-07T10:37:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	I just did that edit, and I'm getting the same error. Thoughts? (It still says I need to change "Driver" from nv to nvidia.)
2006-07-07T10:38:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	think I should remove and reinstall the driver package?
2006-07-07T10:38:00.000Z	tritium	dbmata	no.  If you edit it by hand, you don't re-run the script
2006-07-07T10:39:00.000Z	dbmata	tritium	oh, ok. now I'm confused.
