2006-02-21T13:10:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	let me look at that url for a moment
2006-02-21T13:11:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	where is this url you pasted ifconfig into ?
2006-02-21T13:11:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8624
2006-02-21T13:11:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	what kind of a device is upstream of the ubuntu box?
2006-02-21T13:13:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	its Wireless network card
2006-02-21T13:14:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	so you are connecting to a wireless card?
2006-02-21T13:15:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	sorry you are trying to connect to a wireless lan?
2006-02-21T13:15:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	no the eth1 that is configured with the 192.168.20.70 ip is the network card Broadcom network card
2006-02-21T13:16:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	how do you know tht *.70 is available on your network and that it is not limited to say the bottom 4 ips?
2006-02-21T13:16:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	the wire is connected to a switch then to a router or bridge dunno then to a wireless device on the roof
2006-02-21T13:16:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	what is the ip of the router?
2006-02-21T13:16:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	192.168.20.1 ?
2006-02-21T13:16:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	i really dont know but i put the gateway to 192.168.20.1
2006-02-21T13:17:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	usually they are like 1.1 2.1 or 0.1
2006-02-21T13:18:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	you can't randomly assign an ip so what I suggest to you is you run this command >>sudo dhclient<<
2006-02-21T13:18:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	i really dont know really
2006-02-21T13:18:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	there are better ways but that one may just get an ip
2006-02-21T13:18:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	dhclient what is that?
2006-02-21T13:18:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	a program to obtain an ip via dhcp
2006-02-21T13:19:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	usually your router has it switched on
2006-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	the lan doesn't work thru dhcp everyone on the lan has his own ip with mac address filtered
2006-02-21T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	SAAD3000	then the ip that is correctly assigned to that box and that card is needed -0 you canfind this by booting in windows or suse which you said was working or ask the person who set these filters for an ip for you to use
2006-02-21T13:28:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	i set the ip its my ip 192.168.20.70
2006-02-21T13:28:00.000Z	SAAD3000	ompaul	might it be  a firewall?
