2010-07-20T01:49:00.000Z	Mirambo		Hmm, the current intel driver Ubuntu uses is unusable for the Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset. OR 8xx chips.  Ive read about the issue. Just downgrade to the previous intel driver and all things will be fine! :) Why dont they do that ?
2010-07-20T01:50:00.000Z	Mirambo		I have to contantly move the mouse in order to not have to reboot after the screen does black and wont display graphics again.
2010-07-20T01:51:00.000Z	Mirambo		I cant set another timeout on the screensaver either, because if i open its gui the screen also goes black :)
2010-07-20T01:51:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	you might disable screensaver
2010-07-20T01:51:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	How, if not from the screensaver gui ?
2010-07-20T01:52:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	are you trying the "i915.modeset=1" workaround?
2010-07-20T01:52:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Yes, but ive not added that grub line, should i ?
2010-07-20T01:53:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	it's worth a try. have you tried it and it fixed your issues?
2010-07-20T01:54:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Ill add in that grub line and check. So far, with doing all the other things has not helped much. A bit better. This is an IBM NetVista.
2010-07-20T01:57:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes workaround A. i'm not clear if you have tried it. If you haven't you can add "i915.modeset=1" to grub line on boot to try it.
2010-07-20T01:58:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	I even installed those things, new initrd and all. Ill check this grub line as well so ive tried it all.
2010-07-20T02:01:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	I can go into the screensaver now :)
2010-07-20T02:01:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Screensaver gui that is
2010-07-20T02:02:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Why dont they just use the old, working intel driver ?
2010-07-20T02:03:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	i don't know. this 8xx problem is an embarrasment as far as i'm concerned.
2010-07-20T02:04:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Yeah, why use a less good driver if one wouldnt have to ? :) / Amazing!
2010-07-20T02:04:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	to just make grub change stick: in /etc/default/grub you can change/add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="i915.modeset=1" and then run update-grub.
2010-07-20T02:05:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Hmm, ok but id rather see an intel driver update that adds this line.
2010-07-20T02:09:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	This how easy this could be: Add +1 on the micro or patchlevel versions of the intel driver. Have it add this line to /etc/default/grub and run update-grub. I cant see how this could be bad, can you ?
2010-07-20T02:11:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	A very non-bug really. Why are they using the most crappy versions of most anything they can find ?
2010-07-20T02:12:00.000Z	thune3	Mirambo	there was a decision made for 10.04 release, given the state of drivers at the time and the release window. I believe it was an unfortunate happening.
2010-07-20T02:13:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	They are using other packages with bugs written against them, but the bugs have already been solved years ago even perhaps.
2010-07-20T02:23:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	Thanks very much. This computer works again! :)
2010-07-20T02:25:00.000Z	Mirambo	thune3	A simple grep check for that line in the default grub setup would work perfectly. So easy and yet nothing is beeing done :(
