2009-08-30T01:49:00.000Z	stlsaint	tct13	have you checked that you card is supported
2009-08-30T01:49:00.000Z	stlsaint	tct13	oopps sorry for duplicate question
2009-08-30T01:57:00.000Z	stlsaint	tct13	give your issue again?
2009-08-30T01:59:00.000Z	tct13	stlsaint	the broadcom sta driver (wl module) randomly freezes my computer
2009-08-30T01:59:00.000Z	tct13	stlsaint	I tried with b43-fwcutter but it doesn't work
2009-08-30T02:00:00.000Z	tct13	stlsaint	I mean kernel panics and stuff. the caps lock blinks, I found that the reason for this is the proprietary sta driver
2009-08-30T02:01:00.000Z	tct13	stlsaint	sta driver comes with ubuntu jaunty
2009-08-30T02:04:00.000Z	tct13	stlsaint	how to get b43 working?
2009-08-30T02:04:00.000Z	stlsaint	tct13	checking some stuff right now...thinking its going to be alil too much to give in here
