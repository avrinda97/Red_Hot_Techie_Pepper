2011-01-05T16:16:00.000Z	DBoyz		hi i have a question here
2011-01-05T16:17:00.000Z	DBoyz		when i tried to use my ubuntu, i get the gnu grub screen instead
2011-01-05T16:17:00.000Z	DBoyz		please help me with it
2011-01-05T16:17:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	more details, does it not boot?
2011-01-05T16:18:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	it wont boot cuz it shows the gnu grub screen instead and i have no idea what to do next
2011-01-05T16:19:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	any boot options?
2011-01-05T16:19:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	kindly explain? i am new to ubuntu and i rarely use it (currently using W7)
2011-01-05T16:20:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	on the grub screen does it show this 'GRUB:/>' or similar or does it show a box and some functions?
2011-01-05T16:24:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	i am getting message which is something like: "GNU GRUB Version 1.97beta. There is additional text about how TAB reveals commands and such..."
2011-01-05T16:24:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	then i'd say your grub installed is nuked,
2011-01-05T16:25:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	what does that mean?
2011-01-05T16:25:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	it means either your install messed up or grub didn't/can't detect your ubuntu install
2011-01-05T16:27:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	i don't have a live cd nor a cd/dvd drive on my pc
2011-01-05T16:27:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	usb#?
2011-01-05T16:28:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	then create a live usb stick
2011-01-05T16:28:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	got another pc?
2011-01-05T16:29:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	no i am using the same pc ubuntu is installed to but i'm currently using windows 7
2011-01-05T16:29:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	didi you use wubi?
2011-01-05T16:29:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	yes
2011-01-05T16:30:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	then you boot into mbr then grub, i would just reinstall ubuntu from wubi
2011-01-05T16:30:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	window's boot loader
2011-01-05T16:31:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	btw wubi is known for a lot of bugs that aren't prevalent in the regular install
2011-01-05T16:32:00.000Z	DBoyz	plokij	i used pendrive linux to extract files from the iso file i downloaded to install ubuntu. i couldn't install with wubi
2011-01-05T16:33:00.000Z	plokij	DBoyz	but seriously i'd reccommend reinstalling ubuntu using whatever medium you have if you really want ubuntu
