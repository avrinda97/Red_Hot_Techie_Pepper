2006-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	chi	linkd	static ip's on a router
2006-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	linkd	chi	hmmz, what happens when you try to ping google.com?
2006-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	chi	linkd	i get a replie
2006-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	linkd	chi	hmm, are you able to resolve hosts? i wont had a similar problem except i had problems resolving hosts.
2006-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	linkd	chi	try "host nullnetwork.net" for kicks and tell me if it works
2006-02-24T09:13:00.000Z	chi	linkd	yes that is the problem i cant resolve any hosts!
2006-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	chi	linkd	how did you fix that?
2006-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	linkd	chi	gotcha! now what router are you using?
2006-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	chi	linkd	 its an actiontec
2006-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	chi	linkd	it runs busybox
2006-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	linkd	chi	ok ive never heard of that, however this is what is happening, basically you're linux box is defaulting to always using your router as the nameserver (at your routers request) so effectively linux is overwriting resolv.conf all the time
2006-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	linkd	chi	i came up with 2 solutions.
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	linkd	chi	1 was to use cron to enforce resolv.conf (hackish)
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	chi	linkd	use an outside dns server?
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	linkd	chi	second was i bought a new router, but in theory if you could find the setting on the router, you could disable it
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	linkd	chi	exactly
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	chi	linkd	thanks ;] 
2006-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	linkd	chi	i went from a dlink 504 to a linksys product and it worked perfect (and i actually prefer the linksys router)
2006-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	linkd	chi	just set a password for root
2006-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	linkd	chi	how did u fix it in the end?
2006-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	linkd	chi	good call. i tried that too, but i didnt think much of the dlink 504.
