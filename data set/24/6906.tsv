2006-01-16T15:22:00.000Z	skel		I'm having some serious issues with the vsftpd package that comes with ubuntu
2006-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	whats the problem?
2006-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	or any users for that matter
2006-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	what does /var/log/vsftpd.log say
2006-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	I've restarted it my config is http://rafb.net/paste/results/47cxth85.html
2006-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	look in the vsftp log file for error
2006-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	Wed Jan 11 14:22:18 2006 [pid 27989]  [pubuser]  FAIL LOGIN: Client "127.0.0.1"
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	thats all thats in there
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	well that and Wed Jan 11 14:22:12 2006 [pid 27990]  CONNECT: Client "127.0.0.1" right above it
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	yes, and Ive reset the passwd like 5 times to be sure
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	I can get shell just fine
2006-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	hmm any other options you changed?
2006-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	what I've got in pastebin is my exact config, pretty basic one
2006-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	did you install vsftp with the package?
2006-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	yeah in the basic repository for breezy with apt-get
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	I'll try that
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	ty :)
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	ofcourse it also has to be in /etc/pam.d
2006-01-16T15:30:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	ok I'll mess with that. I do have a vsftpd in /etc/pam.d so I'll give it a whirl. thanks :)
2006-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	gl
2006-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	at least pam is nessecary for authentication
2006-01-16T15:34:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	something is certainly out of whack. when I start it with /etc/init.d/vsftp start   it's running from a differen't pid than specified in the /var/run/vsftpd/vsftpd.pid =/
2006-01-16T15:34:00.000Z	skel	spacey_ki	and I cleared out the stale one first after stopping it
2006-01-16T15:36:00.000Z	spacey_ki	skel	maybe purge the package
