2006-04-22T11:16:00.000Z	brandon_	Lycade	you can boot using a live cd, mount your linux hard drive partition, chroot to it, and then run the grub-install program
2006-04-22T11:18:00.000Z	brandon_	Lycade	are you talking to me?

2006-04-22T11:20:00.000Z	Lycade	brandon_	 - yea I have seen that I can do that. What commands do you want me to run?
