2006-01-06T16:31:00.000Z	andrew_		lemme run something by y'all: there's the adm group for users created as admins, and the users group (assumedly) for those who are not in adm.  however, there's no group that encompasses both (e.g. for allowing all users on a system access to a folder).  it seems like that should be something that happens automatically.  am i missing something or could i file a feature request for that?
2006-01-06T16:32:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	I would think that if normal users can access it, than admins can also access it.
2006-01-06T16:36:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	could you check your user settings?
2006-01-06T16:36:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	sure, what am I looking for?
2006-01-06T16:37:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	a group that encompasses the members of users and adm, i guess.  or something else that's suitable.
2006-01-06T16:37:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	"users" encompasses "all users," and I am in there, and I'm also in admin, so yeah...
2006-01-06T16:38:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	hmm... how could i have messed that up?  i checked all available boxes when adding users.  did you do a fresh install with breezy?
2006-01-06T16:39:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	nope. I installed hoary, then dist-upgraded. I didn't do anything for user setup, just what it asked me to do when I installed it...
2006-01-06T16:39:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	same here with breezy (just yesterday), with the exception of adding four other users for the rest of my family.
2006-01-06T16:41:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	hmm, it looks to me like the default settings for "add user" should be fine.
2006-01-06T16:41:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	i'll try one now...
2006-01-06T16:41:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	they just need to be in default group 'user'.
2006-01-06T16:41:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	yes, but what in the user GUI tool manages that assignment?
2006-01-06T16:42:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	is it the "user profile" on the advanced tab?
2006-01-06T16:42:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	the 'advanced' tab in the user profile editor has that...
2006-01-06T16:42:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	i set all to the administrator profile; shouldn't that still assign them to the users group?
2006-01-06T16:43:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	no, but being admins, they should have access to all user stuff.
2006-01-06T16:43:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	unless you assign something to the users group.
2006-01-06T16:44:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	you can sudo stuff to death, but that doesn't seem the point here.
2006-01-06T16:44:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	I dunno then...
2006-01-06T16:44:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	i would think that the users group would be everyone and the adm would only be those who have the administrator profile.  does that make sense to you?
2006-01-06T16:46:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	I dunno. I would think it's the other way around, that admin is user privaleges and then some, but I don't know much about user privalages and whatnot.
2006-01-06T16:46:00.000Z	andrew_	Grackshrike	we're saying the same thing. ^_^ thanks for the help; i'll file a bug.
2006-01-06T16:47:00.000Z	Grackshrike	andrew_	oh, :P ok...
