2012-05-30T18:23:00.000Z	chrometiger		Hope someone can help me,  i've installed ubuntu on a ext hd   while pluged to my main pc  "which has a nvidia card"    but I really use this on my laptop which has a Intel Mobile 4 series graphics card.   I dont have any 3d acceleration and can't use  Unity or gnome shell because of it   can anyone help ?
2012-05-30T18:24:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	you'd want to reconfigure X for intel
2012-05-30T18:24:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	 k,  have no clue  how
2012-05-30T18:25:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	probably xserver-xorg-video-intel
2012-05-30T18:40:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	 i was lost    will this site help me out if i follow it ?   http://superuser.com/questions/192121/how-to-install-intel-82852-855gm-driver-on-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat
2012-05-30T18:41:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	I doubt you'll need to go to such lengths
2012-05-30T18:42:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	first I'd try simply mv'ing /etc/X11/xorg.conf elsewhere (you might want it later for the nvidia box), and making sure xserver-xorg-video-intel is installed
2012-05-30T18:42:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	  k  how to i make sure of that ?
2012-05-30T18:43:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	try it and if it works you know and if it doesn't work you know
2012-05-30T18:44:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	 my xorg.conf  just says default device    it doesn't even say  nvidia
2012-05-30T18:45:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	not necessarily relevant :p
2012-05-30T18:46:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	point is nvidia's driver (not nouveau) uses xorg.conf, but using intel you shouldn't need it (and probably further do not want it present)
2012-05-30T18:48:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	 ok i've moved it     now what,,   reboot,  and what do i do if it doesn't boot back ?
2012-05-30T18:48:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	it'll boot whether X works or not
2012-05-30T18:48:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	did you make sure the package was installed?
2012-05-30T18:49:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel
2012-05-30T18:49:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	   ok newest version is installed
2012-05-30T18:50:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	if X doesn't start use CTRL+ALT+F2 if necessary to drop to a console, you can use the package 'irssi' to IRC from outside of X, good luck
2012-05-30T18:56:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	 ok  still  I dont have the ability to use gnome shell     or Unity     keep getting reverted to  gnome classic
2012-05-30T18:57:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	that's not necessarily abnormal, I believe it assesses your hardware and chooses which based on what you've got
2012-05-30T19:00:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	its like I have no drivers installed at all   even google earth says  unknown graphics card and closes
2012-05-30T19:26:00.000Z	chrometiger	reisio	ok   Unity works now  not well but works,   gnomeshell and google earth does not,  I still dont know whats going on ?
2012-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	I doubt googleearth is related
2012-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	reisio	chrometiger	gnome shell I don't know, it might require accel
