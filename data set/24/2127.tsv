2009-04-06T08:28:00.000Z	edogzilla		its a fresh install of 8.10 straight from the live cd
2009-04-06T08:29:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69, i get N  2
2009-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69, but keep in mind that i'm actually using the cd right now, not my install, cuz its the only way I can get a desktop to get onto chat cuz i dont know how to do anything from just the command line
2009-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	edogzilla		so i'm really not sure how that affects things
2009-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69, no sorry. forgive me i'm a total newb
2009-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	edogzilla		i would have to restart every time
2009-04-06T08:33:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69, if you will be around a while we could do it that way
2009-04-06T08:33:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69, any ideas?
2009-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69: and if it does...or doesnt?
2009-04-06T08:35:00.000Z	edogzilla		tommi 69: so if I type runlevel 2 in the command line it will work from then on?
2009-04-06T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	'init 2'
2009-04-06T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	What menu entry are you selecting at GRUB?
2009-04-06T08:41:00.000Z	edogzilla	Flannel	um, wow sorry. i'm a first timer and I dont know what you mean. i dont selct or type or press anything it just takes me there when i turn my computer on...sorry about being ignorant here
2009-04-06T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Being new is nothing to apologise about, we're all new at some point.  Alright, you just installed and its doing this?
2009-04-06T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Alright.  Is this a separate computer you're on? So we can play with things while you're still here talking to me?
2009-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	alright.  That's fine, I've got a while.  What I want you to do is reboot, hit escape a few times after the POST screen (you should see something that says 'press ESC to view the GRUB menu' or something like that) once you get there, jot down what menu choices you have.  Try to choose one that doesn't say "recovery mode" (and also, not memtest) and then also keep track of whatever errors it gives you.
2009-04-06T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Yep
2009-04-06T08:58:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Alright, good so far.  And choosing the non-recovery one ended up with what?
2009-04-06T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	So, you got a root prompt? one that ended with #?
2009-04-06T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	oh... that's not single user mode then.  You installed with a liveCD?
2009-04-06T09:02:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Odd indeed. Installed from the liveCD?
2009-04-06T09:04:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Odd.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say you installed a server system  or whatnot.
2009-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	well, you're obviously not in single user mode.  Since you get a $ prompt.  All... I can suggest is going back to it, try ctrl-alt-f7, try 'startx', try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-04-06T11:16:00.000Z	Flannel	edogzilla	Someone here will.  I'm not really a big graphics guy.
