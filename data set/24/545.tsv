2011-07-29T09:26:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	thanks
2011-07-29T09:26:00.000Z	seclm193		!find fglrx
2011-07-29T09:27:00.000Z	seclm193		Is fglrx is compatible with the new kernle in 11.04
2011-07-29T09:27:00.000Z	seclm193		kernel*
2011-07-29T09:28:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Sure, if you install it from the corresponding repository.
2011-07-29T09:28:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	corresponding repository?
2011-07-29T09:29:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Meaning that you use just the natty repository, the same one that you install the kernel from.
2011-07-29T09:30:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	ok, let me tell you my issue.  i have an ati radeon hd 6250.  When i installed 11.04 last time, i could not run aticonfig --initial.  said that one of the libraries is not linked
2011-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	 I know the library is part of the fglrx
2011-07-29T09:32:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Surprising. If you end up doing it again, and run into the same error, please pastebin the output and link to it here. That should not happen.
2011-07-29T09:32:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	 last time, i installed my driver, then updated.  This time i'm going to update, reboot, then install driver.
2011-07-29T09:34:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	 the problem last time was the freezing my computer had when trying to load the gui.  i could boot into failsafe graphics though
2011-07-29T09:34:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Still, it shouldn't happen. Perhaps you updated, and didn't reboot before you tried that. Libraries relating to aticonfig should be kept in line, no matter what.
2011-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	that's what i thought.  I'm hoping that by updating first, the libraries will be linked before i install the driver
2011-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Well, that's another issue and might not have gone away, but rather be linked to the specific hardware. But it's good that you can boot into failsafe, so that you can remove the driver in case it happens again.
2011-07-29T09:36:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	 i know
2011-07-29T09:37:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Alright, well, good luck. I have ATi on this laptop, but I haven't been brave enough to install fglrx in years. Fortunately radeon driver's pretty good, so I won't need it. :)
2011-07-29T09:37:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	 i thought fglrx was used by the radeon drivers
2011-07-29T09:38:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	The driver called 'radeon' is the open source one, and the proprietary is called 'fglrx'.
2011-07-29T09:39:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	huh, don't think i've ever used the open source.  On all my machines, I always installed the restricted drivers
2011-07-29T09:40:00.000Z	astraljava	seclm193	Well, you got lucky then, I guess. I don't have good experience from those. But, gotta get to work now. Hope your streak continues, but pop in here if it doesn't. :) Later.
2011-07-29T09:40:00.000Z	seclm193	astraljava	thanks.  i hope it gets better
