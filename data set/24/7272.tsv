2005-02-22T16:12:00.000Z	rubixXx		anyone know what i can do aobut my keyboard not loading, grub also fails to load 2 modules via the modprobe command with failed permissions
2005-02-22T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	which keyboard have you got that it does not load?
2005-02-22T16:13:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	i havn't done anything with the OS yet its a base install
2005-02-22T16:14:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	so what keyboard is it you are having issues with?
2005-02-22T16:14:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	logitech inavigator
2005-02-22T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	I can't get a picture of that one - is it wireless and the docking bit is usb?
2005-02-22T16:17:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	its a usb keyboard plugged into my onboard usb port
2005-02-22T16:18:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	by any chance do you have a PS2 converter and port?
2005-02-22T16:19:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	perhaps
2005-02-22T16:19:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	i belive i do let me look
2005-02-22T16:19:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	I would suggest that might just be what you need
2005-02-22T16:20:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	it would take hours to find it....
2005-02-22T16:20:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	my usb mouse is detected fine, but not my keyboard
2005-02-22T16:21:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	from what I know it is pretty hit and miss with usb k/b and mouse issues
2005-02-22T16:21:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	it would most likely be well worth your while to actually look for that little bit of kit
2005-02-22T16:21:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	perhaps changing aorund the usb keyboard/mouse would work?
2005-02-22T16:22:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	not sure if i pitched it or not
2005-02-22T16:22:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	it might
2005-02-22T16:23:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	are the usb devices detected at startup or during installation
2005-02-22T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	it needs to be detected at startup so you can do the installation
2005-02-22T16:25:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	my thing is though, does the installation look for usb devices at system startup, or put them into a config file during operating system installation
2005-02-22T16:26:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	startup popluates /proc/usb with them so that they can be used as the day goes on
2005-02-22T16:28:00.000Z	rubixXx	ompaul	so if i switch the usb devices around i won't have to reinstall the OS
2005-02-22T16:29:00.000Z	ompaul	rubixXx	I do not know the answer to that try it and see
