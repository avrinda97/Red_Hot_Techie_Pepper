2006-09-08T07:22:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	what do you mean by change?
2006-09-08T07:22:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	I need more swap space to run Oracle
2006-09-08T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	you can use the live cd to do it regardless of the situation. If you need to take space from one of the active partitions, you won't be able to without using the live cd because it requires deactivating them
2006-09-08T07:24:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	will it hurt my current install?
2006-09-08T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	no
2006-09-08T07:24:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	and this is partitioning we're talking about, right?
2006-09-08T07:25:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	yeah, all you would have to do is resize a partition adjacent to the swap, then resize the swap to take up the newly made free space
2006-09-08T07:25:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	cool. thanks.
2006-09-08T08:11:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	drag and drop although some of them aren't formatted properly
2006-12-31T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	pretty sure there isn't
2006-12-31T07:37:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	too bad. that is deffinately needed.
2006-12-31T07:38:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	just don't use the desktop. I don't have anything on the desktop. Thunar will do it
2006-12-31T07:38:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	yeah, but this pc is for my GF. She's used to windows.
2006-12-31T07:38:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	open up thunar and then go to the desktop with that
2006-12-31T07:39:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	yeah, I'll probably do that instead. just trying to stay away from gnome and its fat ass.
2006-12-31T07:40:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	do you know if xubuntu ships the xfce compositor that allows stuff like drop shadows?
2006-12-31T07:41:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	doubt it
2006-12-31T07:41:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	but don't know
2006-12-31T07:41:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	maybe #xubuntu will know
2006-12-31T07:41:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	k
2007-04-28T15:23:00.000Z	bruenig	jrsims	dpkg --get-selections
2007-04-28T15:23:00.000Z	jrsims	bruenig	thx
