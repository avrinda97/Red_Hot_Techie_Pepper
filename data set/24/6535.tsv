2005-09-26T08:19:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	some to and some got bitten by the bug in the topic
2005-09-26T08:19:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	some do that should read
2005-09-26T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	its in main - so you should be able to get it no problem
2005-09-26T08:21:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	package name k3b
2005-09-26T08:21:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	would you share your source.list ?
2005-09-26T08:22:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	it is in main, the base of any source.list
2005-09-26T08:22:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	deb http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy main restricted
2005-09-26T08:24:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	in a terminal >>sudo apt-get update<<
2005-09-26T08:26:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	the package k3b is not a ubuntu package in my list
2005-09-26T08:26:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	paste your sources into paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-26T08:29:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/d2413
2005-09-26T08:29:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	caught it as you pasted it - have you an apt.conf?
2005-09-26T08:31:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	ooch
2005-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	what about the apt.conf ?
2005-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	you should not be getting conflicts with dbus - however given what happened with breezy last night where  X died I would not advise anyone to do further updates unless they are able to recover from total system failures themselves - with an apt.conf you get to make breezy take the native package first before the others - so that in the event of a conflict you do not interfer with the installed software
2005-09-26T08:37:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	is tha timple to tell that in apt-conf or can you point me at some doc ?
2005-09-26T08:40:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	hang about this box is less than 6 hours installed I will find one for here and pass it on, my syntax might be wrong otherwise
2005-09-26T08:55:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	 create that file and put this in it - I am 99% certain that is correct  >>APT::Default-Release "breezy";
2005-09-26T08:57:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	ok, doing it
2005-09-26T08:58:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	however I would abstain from doing any upgrade till the topic here changes
2005-09-26T08:59:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	too late ;o)
2005-09-26T09:00:00.000Z	ompaul	leagris	don't reboot :-)
2005-10-04T16:08:00.000Z	leagris	ompaul	you appear having quit good ubuntu knowledge. What is the correct ubuntu way of having system global settings for printing and not having to set it up for each users ?
