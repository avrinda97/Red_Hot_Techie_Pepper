2007-03-07T17:21:00.000Z	techie_		I need to do some voice recording and tried to use the "sound recorder" but tells me my multimedia settings must be setup... How do I do that? Or is there a better program to use for this?
2007-03-07T17:22:00.000Z	techie_		Can anybody recommend a good voice recorder or help me setup the one offered by Ubuntu?
2007-03-07T17:23:00.000Z	techie_		What's the best way to voice record in here?
2007-03-07T17:24:00.000Z	techie_		Do we have in Ubuntu anything like soundforge in xp?
2007-03-07T07:44:00.000Z	techie_		hi all. Can anybody help? Just because Ubuntu offers bluetooth capability that does not necessarily mean that my computer does have bluetooth, does it?
2007-03-07T07:45:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	that's correct
2007-03-07T07:47:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	do you mean a video camcorder?
2007-03-07T07:47:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	gyaresu, No, it is a voice digital recorder
2007-03-07T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	if you're lucky, it works as a USB mass storage device. If not, you'll have to reverse-engineer the Windows drivers and write some for Linux.
2007-03-07T07:49:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	assuming it does how do you set up as a mass storage device (though I doubt it)
2007-03-07T07:50:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	mass storage devices mount automatically. Run 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' while you plug it in to find out what ubuntu does with the device. Compare to when you plug in a memory stick.
2007-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	it's very unlikely to work. Drivers generally tie in closely with the OS kernel.
2007-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	i see
2007-03-07T07:52:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	But don't we have a recording device in Ubuntu I can use even if I have to sit at the computer while I do it.
2007-03-07T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	do contact Panasonic about it as well. It won't help immediately, but it's good if they see that there is demand for Linux drivers.
2007-03-07T07:52:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	I already did
2007-03-07T07:53:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	if you can engage them in a dialogue, tell them that the community will write drivers for them if they publish the specifications.
2007-03-07T07:53:00.000Z	techie_	soundray	that's a great idea
2007-03-07T07:55:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	check out the topic of the channel #bash -- very valuable stuff there
2007-03-08T08:21:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	audacity
2007-03-08T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	I haven't tested sound recorder properly. Audacity is not pretty, but it has useful editing, level setting, mixing and other features
2007-03-08T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	the topic of #bash also has very useful information
2007-03-08T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	it's another IRC channel. Try /join #bash
2007-03-08T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	techie_	I said read the topic
