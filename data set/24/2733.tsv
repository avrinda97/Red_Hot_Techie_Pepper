2008-09-06T14:38:00.000Z	hischild	pRoFiOn	edit the file and check if you can ping for example google.com. if not
2008-09-06T14:42:00.000Z	pRoFiOn	hischild	- same thing, can ping gateway, can't google
2008-09-06T14:42:00.000Z	hischild	pRoFiOn	do you have static ip?

2008-09-06T14:45:00.000Z	hischild	pRoFiOn	don't paste.
2008-09-06T14:46:00.000Z	hischild	pRoFiOn	seems like you're missing default gateway. ----> sudo route add default gw 192.168.2.1

2008-09-06T14:50:00.000Z	hischild	pRoFiOn	hmm ... seems i misread that command and you do have a default gateway ... leaves me to a mistery ... sorry :(
