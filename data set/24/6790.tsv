2006-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	CNAP		ok i've got a good one here. i have 2 NICs on the same hub with the same MAC address. both are receiving IP's and are able to ping, also do name resolution. however i can't access anything useful like HTTP, apt-get, even XCHAT. can anyone here atleast help figure out why?
2006-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	yeah, they got the same MAC. change one of them
2006-04-28T06:40:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	with MAC spoofing you will probably be able to get an ip, but won't be able to do anything useful. especially not on the same network (might work if the two MACs don't collide). 2 NIC with same MAC is asking for trouble.
2006-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	it is common to spoof the MAC to fooling ISP's you're using only one computer when using a DSL modem connected to a router. But it only work 50% of the time.
2006-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	oh yes, it works alright. but luck is involved. I've seen it work, i've seen it fail. I set it up myself for some ISP modems. but as I said, it is a hit'n'miss thing.
2006-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	try to change one of them.
2006-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	well, an easy solution: get a proper router
2006-04-28T06:45:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	let the modem take the MAC address from the router and connect as many NICS as you need.
2006-04-28T06:49:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	here's the thing. if you have a DSL modem you can either 1. let the modem handle the connection, ISP will get the MAC of NIC connected to modem. 2. let router handle the connection _through_ the modem, ISP will get whatever MAC you tell the router to use for the DSL connection. It's a done deal.
2006-04-28T06:50:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	i'm not surprised. get a router. it's not more than 50?
2006-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	it's because the hub isn't a router. a router translates traffic, a hub doesn't
2006-04-28T06:52:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	the router can see which IP belong to which MAC and can redirect (or, hear this: "route") traffic.
2006-04-28T06:52:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	a HUB is just a dummy connector. it got no intelligence
2006-04-28T06:53:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	yes, but by chance only.
2006-04-28T06:54:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	MAC spoofing is useful as long as only one computer is connected at one time.
2006-04-28T06:55:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	nope, you did it correctly. but the first time it worked "reliably" was pure luck.
2006-04-28T06:56:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	another possibility you have: modem connected to computer 1 (with two nics) connected to computer 2. computer 1 acts as a router. this is more stable.
2006-04-28T06:58:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	router is the way to go. and they are cheap nowadays. If you spoof the MAC, only have one computer connected at a time and it will work fine.
2006-04-28T06:59:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	your thoughts were in the right way at least. it's your HUB that make it fail since it can not direct traffic properly.
2006-04-28T07:01:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	oh and one more thing, don't be tempted to get a switch instead of a router. a switch is only useful behind a router.
2006-04-28T07:01:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	yep, been there myself :)
2006-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	good choice. P.S. avoid D-Link
2006-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	THAT I have thought of myself actually. extra cash
2006-04-28T07:10:00.000Z	Jowi	CNAP	don't buy a second hand router. you might need the warranty! (trust me on that one)
