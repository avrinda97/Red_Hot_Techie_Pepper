2008-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni		Hi, need help. I think I lost sudo after I created a user called 'admin', what do I do now?
2008-06-16T12:54:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni		I cant unlock synaptic or sudo anymore, please help.
2008-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni		I added user 'admin' and now I cant sudo anymore.
2008-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	can you 'so root'?
2008-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	ok let me try
2008-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	if so, you probably just have a bjroked sudoers file
2008-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	and i'm sure there's an ubuntu facilitiy for managing that
2008-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	It says Authentication failure.
2008-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	'su root' and you type in your root password and you get an authentication failure
2008-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	?
2008-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	yes.
2008-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	all this started after i created 'admin' user.
2008-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	that's not ideal at all.
2008-06-16T13:00:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	and you need to type in the root password, not your user password
2008-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	Is there a "root password"
2008-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	'su' allows you to switch to another user, whereas 'sudo' let's you run a program as another user provided your user is into the sudoers file.
2008-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	there is most definietly a root passowrd.
2008-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	i dont think its default in ubuntu
2008-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	huh *shrug*
2008-06-16T13:02:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	well, i don't know how to fix that off the top of my head.  you could boot into single uer mode and then set a root pass.
2008-06-16T13:03:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	or at least that's how i'd do it; there might be some ubuntu-specific backup plan to reattach feet after blowing them off.
2008-06-16T13:03:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	oh ok, thanks garrett__
2008-06-16T13:04:00.000Z	garrett__	InvisiblePinkUni	if you have a user that can sudo, then 'sudo bash' and get a root bash prompt.  you can then run any program, as root privs will be inherited by any spawned process.
2008-06-16T13:05:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	garrett__	thanks.
