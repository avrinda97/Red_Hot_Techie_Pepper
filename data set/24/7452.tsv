2004-12-29T11:53:00.000Z	aquarius		I've got a mate, running Ubuntu. He's not very computer literate. I'd like to send him a program to run, which is not packaged for Ubuntu (or Debian). It's currently available as source. What's the best way for me to get the program to him so that he can easily install it? Should I build a deb? (Clicking debs from Nautilus doesn't seem to work on my warty install.)
2004-12-29T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	what program is it?
2004-12-29T11:55:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	in this case it's comical (http://comical.sourceforge.net/), but I'm interested in a more general solution.
2004-12-29T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	use a web search engine to see if anyone has made unofficial debs
2004-12-29T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	otherwise your best bet is to compile and install it in /usr/local
2004-12-29T11:58:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	yep, that's what *I'd* do, but I don't want to have to talk him through the ./configure, make, make install dance if I can avoid it; I'd rather either ship him a compiled binary or some previously existing thing which does the compilation etc for him. I did think about building my own .deb, but I'm not great at building debs.
2005-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	apt has always been intelligent about {up,down}grades
2005-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	the user, however, usually isn't.
2005-01-02T17:23:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	ha. Well put.
2005-03-31T07:57:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	both warty and hoary {will} ship with a 2.6 kernel
2005-03-31T07:57:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	yep. So does /etc/init.d/modutils requiring /proc/ksyms, which isn't in 2.6 kernels, count as a bug?
2005-03-31T07:58:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	it requires /proc/ksyms? It doesn't do so on my Warty or Hoary boxes.
2005-03-31T07:59:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	line 9 in my /etc/init.d/modutils: [ -f /proc/ksyms ]  || exit 0
2005-03-31T08:00:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	no, it's not a bug, why?
2005-03-31T08:00:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	what if you had to boot a 2.4 kernel on that box?
2005-03-31T08:00:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	ok, but that means that modules listed in /etc/modules don't get loaded if you boot a 2.6 kernel.
2005-03-31T08:01:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	they do get loaded.
2005-03-31T08:01:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	what loads them? I'm puzzled.
2005-03-31T08:02:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	I have apm in /etc/modules, and it's not loaded when the machine boots. "modprobe apm" works fine when I do it myself, though.
2005-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	look in /etc/init.d/module-init-tools
2005-03-31T08:10:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	no such file. hm. apt-get --reinstall install module-init-tools hasn't recreated it, either. How can I get it back? It's in dpg --listfiles module-init-tools.
2005-03-31T08:11:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	unpack the deb using dpkg-deb, then copy it over manually
2005-03-31T08:14:00.000Z	aquarius	crimsun	that should be OK. Cheers for the help.
2005-03-31T08:14:00.000Z	crimsun	aquarius	np
