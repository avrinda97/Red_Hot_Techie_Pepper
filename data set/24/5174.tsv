2006-10-11T15:42:00.000Z	avagant		hmmmm sudo doesn't ask me for my password anymore.
2006-10-11T15:42:00.000Z	avagant		how do i logout enough so that it asks for it again?
2006-10-11T15:42:00.000Z	avagant		it just goes straight to root.
2006-10-11T15:44:00.000Z	avagant		I got kinda nervous for a minute.
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	avagant		Why are people even using the edgy beta if it isn't fully finished yet?
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	impatient maybe/
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	avagant		I don't understand the reasoning.
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	boredom?
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	avagant		beta=lots of problems?
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	oviously what they have isn't good enough
2006-10-11T12:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	not necessarily
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	i've seen fantastic beta products, and horrible final products
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	I've read people say they've had nothing but problems.
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	using ubuntu?
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	Edgy ubuntu yah.
2006-10-11T12:43:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	I've got dapper and fight enough with that, I don't need something else to make it worse. :)
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	i don't know. i just have a local friend that is having problems with the stable releases, yet keeps using it
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	i'm happy with debian sid (since 7 years now)
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	I want something that has a little more sound stability.
2006-10-11T12:44:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	linux alsa with 2.6?
2006-10-11T12:45:00.000Z	tarzeau	avagant	what's the problem? it's fine stable for me
2006-10-11T12:45:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	This time it's working fine, but I don't know if maybe I'm just lucky so far.
2006-10-11T12:45:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	I can't play more than one sound at once, well for some reason this reinstall I can.
2006-10-11T12:45:00.000Z	avagant	tarzeau	But I've fought with this for just about forever.
