2009-01-11T02:34:00.000Z	archivator		What is the cpu load for an idle Windows guest running in VirtualBox? I'm getting 20-25% and a load of >1.2
2009-01-11T02:34:00.000Z	archivator		What is the usual cpu load*
2009-01-11T02:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	really depends on what processes are running in the background in winodws
2009-01-11T02:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	an idle windows, with no strange stuff running in the background, should be quite minimal
2009-01-11T02:36:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	absolutely no user app is running in the background. Just the win services, with the updates disabled
2009-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	and the task manager (in windows) shows low usage?
2009-01-11T02:37:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	correct.
2009-01-11T02:39:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	do you have multiple cores, like a dual core or the amd phenom, also, do you have virtualization (in the processor) turned on in the virtual box configs?
2009-01-11T02:39:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	no, a single core 3.8 GHz pentium
2009-01-11T02:40:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	ah, single core uses *much* more of the processor, and the lack of virtualization routines
2009-01-11T02:40:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	the processor is having to work very hard; you would notice a huge difference by upgrading your proc marginally to a dual core
2009-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	not without changing the mobo as well. I believe the problem to be a software one as the reverse case (linux guest in windows host) gives me normal idle usage.
2009-01-11T02:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	then ea. os (linux and windows) would have their own proc to use, thereby significantly increasing the stability and operation of ea. os
2009-01-11T02:42:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	we're talking about 3.8 billion operations a second. I think that's plenty for each :)
2009-01-11T02:42:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	forgive me, but i would much prefer a quad core 2.0 gighz to a 3.8 ghz any day
2009-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	particularly in linux since it actually uses all the cores ;)
2009-01-11T02:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	i'm sorry, but I'
2009-01-11T02:44:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	m all out of ideas.  perhaps it's something to do with video... are you using a 3d card, or a vesa card, and vice versa w/ drivers
2009-01-11T02:44:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	3D accel is disabled in the guest. I actually think it's the net driver VB uses.
2009-01-11T02:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	not in the guest, in linux; the reason i say this, is that it seems likely that virtual box is having to do some additional emulation for something it generally doesn't
2009-01-11T02:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	like having to do extra work drawing the window, accessing the hard drive, ram, etc...
2009-01-11T02:46:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	I have 3D up and running, with 64 MB reserved for the guest.
2009-01-11T02:46:00.000Z	rdw200169	archivator	perhaps windows is wasting a lot of processor operations with a swap file, do you know if windows is using one... 64mb is not very much!
2009-01-11T02:48:00.000Z	archivator	rdw200169	64MB video RAM is plenty. The recommended amount is below 32. Disk IO in the guest is minimal/absent. I really do believe this is a host issue.
