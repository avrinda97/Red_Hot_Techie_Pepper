2005-10-21T06:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 you actually have one? :P
2009-06-15T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 have you recently clened out your /var/lib/dpkg directory?
2009-06-15T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 im asking if you DID clean it out or some how manually mess with that directory. Ive seen a simile rissue when that directory /var/lib/dpkg/ gets erased by mistake
2009-06-15T18:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 does that file exist? /var/lib/dpkg/status ?
2009-06-15T18:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 you have done  a 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade' recently?
2009-06-15T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 thats vague.. what command gives what error exactly?
2009-06-15T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 http://drop.io/dr_willis   has my 'status' file. but it seems it may be customized for each pc. Since its listing the status of all packages.. if it exists on your system check the permissions on it.  or google for how to 'recreate' it. I have to run. good luck
2011-01-24T18:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 i imagone in some far corner of the world.. someone somewhere did.....
2012-08-12T19:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 i find unity works very well for me and is very useable
2012-08-12T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 its a rant. if you want a different desktop.. then install one
2012-11-27T02:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 terminator is a suouped up gnometerminal so its in X.  tmux and screen are text only so work over ssh and the console also
2012-11-27T02:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 there used to be a app called 'twin' that had a neat feature set. but i think its dead
2012-11-27T02:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 byobu is tmux or screen with a more user friendly setup.
2012-11-27T02:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sambagirl	 if its a X gui app.. its terminator. for ssh/console it would be screen or tmux.
