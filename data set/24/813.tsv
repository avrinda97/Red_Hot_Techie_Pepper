2011-12-26T10:20:00.000Z	rhineheart_m		just wondering if package 'bum', or update-rc.d  is GUI
2011-12-26T10:20:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	I think bum is GUI
2011-12-26T10:24:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	just to make boot times faster or is there underlying problem?
2011-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	yes. very much.. coz a certain script/command is trying to shutdown the system after a certain time using sleep command
2011-12-26T10:26:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	should be "sudo update-rc.d {servicename} remove" right?
2011-12-26T10:27:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	will try that
2011-12-26T10:28:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	PID is the name of the process right?
2011-12-26T10:30:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	is it a service or a process?
2011-12-26T10:30:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	if its a service, then use the command I previously I gave you. If it's a process, then here's the command to kill it: "killall {procname}"
2011-12-26T10:32:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	it can be killed usingkill -9 `ps -aef | grep 'sleep 1800' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`
2011-12-26T10:33:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	so the question is..how to autokill or remove it totally from the system?
2011-12-26T10:34:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	do "which {programname}"
2011-12-26T10:35:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	/bin/sleep
2011-12-26T10:39:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	after I executed "which sleep 1800" it gives me /bin/sleep ....
2011-12-26T10:40:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	do you know which process is doing the autocall on sleep?
2011-12-26T10:40:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	I don't know.. can't figure out..
2011-12-26T10:53:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	is this issue complicated? please tell me.. :)
2011-12-26T10:53:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	yes, I'm afraid it's more than a little complicated :(
2011-12-26T10:54:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	sleep process should not be present in ubuntu box correct? unless there's a script which calls/creates it?
2011-12-26T10:55:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	sleep is just like the "wait" command I think. it SHOULD be present. but yes, some script is calling it
2011-12-26T10:56:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	is there a way to know what are those scripts that trigger it?
2011-12-26T10:56:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	not as far as I know...
2011-12-26T11:01:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	kroq-gar78	what if identifying what commands are being executed during the boot up process? do you think I can pin it down in that approach?
2011-12-26T11:02:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rhineheart_m	not sure... I'm not an ubuntu ninja :( probably somebody else here will know...
