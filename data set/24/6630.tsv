2005-11-10T11:46:00.000Z	tritium	hawking	check the Mathematics section either here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/math/, or in synaptic
2005-11-10T11:48:00.000Z	tritium	hawking	with math, plenty.  With maxima, none
2005-11-10T11:49:00.000Z	tritium	hawking	my advise is that you should learn to do it yourself ;)
