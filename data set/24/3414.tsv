2010-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	Taev		when i try and compile its telling me I need those packages
2010-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	Taev		but I have those packages installed
2010-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Taev		i just installed all the -dev and dbg packages
2010-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Taev		nothing
2010-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Taev		same thing
2010-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	Taev		libgtkhtml-2.0 not found, but libgtkhtml, libgtkhtml-dev, and libgtkhtml-dbg are installed
2010-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	Taev		ok fine can some one name a good HTML Editor
2010-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	Taev		for Lucid
2010-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	Taev		well i guess ill just use bluefish
2010-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	Taev		to be honest I am really not feeling that great about Lucid, nor am I happy about being forced to upgrade my server from 8.04 or stop receiving updates.
2010-06-12T12:24:00.000Z	rww	Taev	I'm not sure how a server is relevent to a HTML editor anyway, since Ubuntu Server isn't GUI-based, but still.
2010-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	rww	Taev	The gnome-meta packages don't get much love in Ubuntu. That breakage was a known bug; I generally recommend installing gnome-desktop-environment instead and installing any extra packages you want on top of that manually.
2010-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	rww	Taev	(generally, Ubuntu people go with ubuntu-desktop rather than the Gnome packages)
2010-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	rww	Taev	the "gnome" package likely wouldn't install development headers anyway. If you tell me which library it's complaining about missing, I can point you to a specific package.
2010-06-12T12:10:00.000Z	rww	Taev	Ubuntu Server 8.04 is supported for five years, so until 2013...
2010-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	rww	Taev	is there a package ending in -dev with a similar name? That's probably what it actually wants.
2010-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	rww	Taev	as I've said, it probably needs a package with a similar name with -dev on the end, not the package it's listing
2010-06-12T12:24:00.000Z	rww	Taev	Server 8.04 is supported until 2013. If five years isn't a long enough support period for you, you're using the wrong distro.
2010-06-12T12:27:00.000Z	rww	Taev	As you keep saying. It might be a good idea to diagnose that problem at some point.
2010-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	rww	Taev	Considering that 8.04 to 10.04 upgrades were tested extensively by the QA team, that would count as a bug, which you should either file or provide logs from. We can't help you if you don't do either.
2010-06-12T12:30:00.000Z	rww	Taev	Mark Shuttleworth's
2010-06-12T12:31:00.000Z	rww	Taev	I believe the rationale was "we want to put stuff on the right-hand side, so we needed to free up the space".
2010-06-12T12:31:00.000Z	rww	Taev	Software Center is designed for non-technical users. Synaptic is not.
