2006-09-27T06:15:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	512MB RAM is "enough" depending on what you do.
2006-09-27T06:15:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	512MB is fine for typical home usage.
2006-09-27T06:17:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	I have 512MB RAM and 256MB swap. I /want/ stuff cleared from RAM instead of swapping to disk.
2006-09-27T07:02:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	define lag.
2006-09-27T07:03:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	I know.
2006-09-27T07:05:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	that sounds like a video redraw thing. Very likely related to your video card + driver.
2006-09-27T07:06:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	your video chipset is SiS?
2006-09-27T07:07:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	hmmm, is this embedded video on the motherboard?
2006-09-27T07:08:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	yikes. Er, I try to avoid those because they are usually cheap and slow. You may just have to live with that until you can swap hardware.
2006-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	I recommend upgrading to a new motherboard and nVidia AGP or PCIe graphics adapter.
2006-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	I know that may not be an option.
2006-09-27T07:11:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	Hrm, give the video adapter as much shared memory as your BIOS will allow. Other than that there is not much you can do.
2006-09-27T07:13:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	If the option is available in your BIOS then you have to reboot and get into the BIOS settings on your PC using the instructions given you by the PC manufacturer. Depends on your BIOS as to how you actually access it. I know how to do mine, not yours.
2006-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	you'll just have to go through the BIOS pages until you see the option for amount of RAM to give the video. It may not BE there.
2006-09-27T07:17:00.000Z	eracc	azza_008	what LjL said about the driver is good advice too.
