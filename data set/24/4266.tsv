2007-05-23T11:18:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	do you have a pastebin of your current sources.list file?
2007-05-23T11:18:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	I can make one if you like its only 4 lines after Flannels etitations
2007-05-23T11:19:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	just private-chat it to me then
2007-05-23T11:19:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	ok 1 sec plz
2007-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	 did you get my PM?
2007-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	nope
2007-05-23T11:26:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	get it now?
2007-05-23T11:26:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	not getting it at all. I opened a dialog window to you, though. post it in there
2007-05-23T11:28:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	and which one is failing?
2007-05-23T11:31:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	and which one is failing?
2007-05-23T11:35:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	try added a line to sources.list under your security line that is identical except instead of "deb" at the beginning, it's "deb-src" and also try removing universe multiverse from both of those security lines (we can add them separately later)
2007-05-23T11:36:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	you were told to add it to security? or to all of them?
2007-05-23T11:37:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	try adding deb-src first, and if that fails see if removing universe multiverse helps
2007-05-23T11:38:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	that is, try adding an identical security line with deb-src instead of deb underneath  the actual security line
2007-05-23T11:40:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	also, check and make sure you have bzip2 installed
2007-05-23T11:44:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	removing the universe multive verse did it THANK YOU SO MUCH
2007-05-23T11:45:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	you're welcome. if you still want to have those, you can add another deb and deb-src line that's identical to the other security line except it has JUST universe multiverse and nothing else
2007-05-23T11:46:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	i will try that and see if i get errors othereise ill go back to the old one =P
2007-05-23T11:50:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	both are working thanks a bunch again, just for my clarification why did 'apt-get update like it' (if someone else has the same problem id be able to answer it)
2007-05-23T11:51:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	I'm pretty sure it's because the security updates from the ubuntu team are kept separate from anywhere else (I've never even seen security updates from universe and multiverse, actually, so there may be no such thing)
2007-05-23T11:51:00.000Z	rococo	HalonChilled_	to be honest, I haven't really looked into it that deeply
2007-05-23T11:51:00.000Z	HalonChilled_	rococo	ok thanks again ill let you get on to more important things
