2011-10-14T01:12:00.000Z	martian	Calinou	How about adjusting your monitor settings
2011-10-14T01:12:00.000Z	Calinou		can't, laptop
2011-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	Calinou		I just did chmod to install a library
2011-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	Calinou		to compile something (still failed), here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/xuC02TtN
2011-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	Calinou		some commands are wrong, like --r, ignore them
2011-10-14T01:14:00.000Z	martian	Calinou	oh well, I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but setting 777 to all that stuff is not a good idea.
2011-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	Calinou		nobody told me
2011-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	Calinou		nothing to do?
2011-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	Calinou		can I at least save my /home folder?
2011-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	Calinou	oCean	how many effort?
2011-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	martian	Calinou	certainly. Copy all of your home directory contents to some external media or a separate partition.
2011-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	Calinou		also, how can I remove a partition?
2011-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	Calinou		I have a 10.04 unused partition
2011-10-14T01:17:00.000Z	martian	Calinou	I would suggest you boot off the ubuntu live cd and then copy all the stuff you want to keep to something
