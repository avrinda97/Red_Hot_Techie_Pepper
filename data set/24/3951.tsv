2008-01-22T17:47:00.000Z	BlackAlex		laughzilla - i got flash working fine with ubuntu gutsy ?
2008-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	BlackAlex		is there a problem people are having with adobe flash?
2008-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	BlackAlex		uh.
2008-01-22T17:49:00.000Z	BlackAlex		i got it working somehow...
2008-01-22T17:49:00.000Z	BlackAlex		anyhow any ideas on how to get my cdrom drive to be detected by ubuntu so it can be used?
2008-01-22T17:49:00.000Z	BlackAlex		i have three cd rom drives and i think they are conflicting somehow...
2008-01-22T17:50:00.000Z	BlackAlex		yeah they are all detected just fine...
2008-01-22T17:50:00.000Z	BlackAlex		its moreover when ubuntu needs the ubuntu disk
2008-01-22T17:50:00.000Z	BlackAlex		its not finding it for some reason.
2008-01-22T17:50:00.000Z	BlackAlex		yeah
2008-01-22T17:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	BlackAlex	solve that issue by removing the cd deb line from /etc/apt/sources.list you do not need it
2008-01-22T17:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	BlackAlex	when done editing that file make sure to save it and the sudo apt-get update
2008-01-22T17:51:00.000Z	BlackAlex		i have dsl
2008-01-22T17:52:00.000Z	BlackAlex		i dont mind downloading packages tho...

2008-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	BlackAlex	not a fix exactly . more like a " avoiding the issue" :)
2008-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	BlackAlex		1.5 mbps internet... not too shabby...
2008-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	BlackAlex		true.
2008-01-22T18:00:00.000Z	BlackAlex	IdleOne	well heres whats going on though - i got cdromx (4 of them) in my media folder... they arent mounting inside the /cdrom/ drive as ubuntu is trying to find it there ..
