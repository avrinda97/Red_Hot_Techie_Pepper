2006-09-22T15:24:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		can I use the Ubunbu CD fore recovery? I moved /etc and now nothing works. Noet even run level 1.
2006-09-22T15:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	/etc needs to be on /
2006-09-22T15:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	i'd boot the alternate cd to recovery mode, mount it and edit
2006-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I was trying to put /etc in subversion for version control of the config files.
2006-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I did it the wrong way
2006-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	i did that with rcs/cvs years back, yeah
2006-09-22T15:27:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	Maybe you can help me. I tried to move /etc into /svn/trunk/etc but that broke the system. Is there another way I can do this?
2006-09-22T15:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	first, mv it back of course, so you can get in, heheh.  then i would "check in" that tree to cvs, but i have no svn experience, u;kk bet there is an equivalent command though
2006-09-22T15:29:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	Oh, /etc would be a symlink to /svn/trunk/etc
2006-09-22T15:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	is that adequate help?  i'm not svn-fluent
2006-09-22T15:29:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	That helps some
2006-09-22T15:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	well, /etc needs to be readable on boot, perhaps the other should be the symlink
2006-09-22T15:30:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I tried that but the only thing that was added to subversion was the symlink. Nothing in /etc was added.
2006-09-22T15:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	see http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ too
2006-09-22T15:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	anything they say there has to be in / is somewhat critical not to change, heh
2006-09-22T15:32:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I know. What I'm trying to do is have any change that I make in /etc ( the working etc ) added to the subversion repository.
2006-09-22T15:33:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	In the past I just copied the data into the porject folder. It was messy but it did work
2006-09-22T15:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	yeah, i understood that part, presently i just have a cron job run duplicity on /etc to back it up
2006-09-22T15:34:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I'll think of something
2006-09-22T15:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	uses gpg ssh and rsync protocols, sweet little app
2006-09-22T15:35:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I use rdiff-backup. I have a script/cron job that does a full backup on the first of the month and diff's every Sunday
2006-09-22T15:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	it's on the wiki somewhere, but you need a 1gb drive to store the cd image, i guess
2006-09-22T15:38:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	eyequeue	I'll do some searching
2006-09-22T15:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	DigitalNinja	good luck
