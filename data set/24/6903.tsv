2005-06-24T11:06:00.000Z	lxuser		im looking for how to add some libraries missin in my Ubuntu
2005-06-24T11:06:00.000Z	lxuser		i need to run JBuilder
2005-06-24T11:07:00.000Z	lxuser		 ./jbuilder: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	you need to install  libs/libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 from universe
2005-06-24T11:10:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	if you're missing some shared libraries, you can always go on http://packages.ubuntu.com and search te contents of all available packages for a specific file
2005-06-24T11:11:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	sudo apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2
2005-06-24T11:13:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	sudo apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2
2005-06-24T11:13:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	believe me, you want to do that...
2005-06-24T11:14:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	then you need to enable the universe repository
2005-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	uncomment _all_ lines that begin with deb???
2005-06-24T11:17:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	go back to how it was and replace all occurencies of "main restircted" with "main restricted universe multiverse"
2005-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	don't worry, could you perhaps paste your /etc/apt/sources.list at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl ?
2005-06-24T11:46:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	will take a look
2005-06-24T11:48:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	i'll edit it and re-submit
2005-06-24T11:51:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	still there?
2005-06-24T11:52:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	take a look at what i submitted over http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl, that's all you need
2005-06-24T11:55:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	sorry, yes
2005-06-24T11:56:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	that'll do it
2005-06-24T11:56:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	try it out
2005-06-24T11:56:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	despite my ip address I'm from Germany
2005-06-24T12:01:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	indeed
2005-06-24T12:01:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	out of curiosity... why are you asking?
2005-06-24T12:02:00.000Z	theine	lxuser	I see
2005-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	lxuser	theine	can i just dowload the packages and install them manually...?
