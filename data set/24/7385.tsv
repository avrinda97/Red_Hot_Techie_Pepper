2005-01-05T14:43:00.000Z	cyph		hmm, is there a copy of ndiswrapper on the ubuntu 4.10 cd somewhere? i'd like to install it
2005-01-05T14:44:00.000Z	cyph		ah, so ubuntu installs it by default? excellent

2005-01-05T14:46:00.000Z	cyph	ogra	sadly, that appears to require an internet connection to download ndiswrapper; right now the internet connection is not an option without having ndiswrapper in the first place :(
2005-01-05T14:47:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	where does it say that ?
2005-01-05T14:47:00.000Z	cyph	ogra	"update your repository"; plus ndiswrapper-utils doesn't come up in package search in synaptic
2005-01-05T14:48:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	hmm, thought it is on the cd
2005-01-05T14:51:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	nope
2005-01-05T14:51:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	its the instabilities of sid plus the ones of hoary
2005-01-05T14:52:00.000Z	cyph	ogra	that sounds scary :(
2005-01-05T14:53:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	it is scary, but you see what will be coming up next ;) i.e. 45 boottime or a really fast starting X server etc
2005-01-05T14:55:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	easy solved
2005-01-05T14:57:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	no ati drivers (from ati) for xorg yet
2005-01-05T14:59:00.000Z	cyph	ogra	yeah, that's why i was wondering about the xorginess of hoary... had the same problem with suse 9.2 on the laptop, since suse ships it with xorg by default
2005-01-05T15:00:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	i may be wrong, but i think the ati drivers from xorg are ok.....
2005-01-05T15:00:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	then wait till april :)
2005-01-05T15:00:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	and stay with warty
2005-01-05T15:01:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	for the hoary release i mean :)
2005-01-05T15:01:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	you got a amd64 ?
2005-01-05T15:02:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	lucky you.....
2005-01-05T15:02:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	i would consider some bucks for a new card then....
2005-01-05T15:02:00.000Z	cyph	ogra	can't really swap the card out in a laptop though
2005-01-05T15:03:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	nope, but desnt it have usb or pcmcia ?
2005-01-05T15:03:00.000Z	ogra	cyph	so you could swap it with a wlan card ;)
