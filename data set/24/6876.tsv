2005-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	ThE__OnE		what woulld an address of something in my home folder be?
2005-06-26T14:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	 /home/you/filename ?
2005-06-26T14:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	probably .xchat2
2005-06-26T15:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	Requests For Comment - sort of internet standards
2005-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	please don't /msg without asking
2005-06-28T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	I used to - why?
2005-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	erm.. enlightenment doesn't come with Gnome
2005-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	umm - just ask in channel so others can help too
2005-06-28T06:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	if you're lucky, it will have an entry in the gdm startup list, if you are unlucky you'll have to make a ~/.xsession file or hack a file in /usr/share/xsessions or similar
2005-06-28T06:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	then you need either a default session (self-defined in ~/.xsession ) or a file in /usr/share/xsessions to point in the right place
2005-06-28T06:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	the simplest ~/.xsession would be a file containing the words " exec enlightenment "
2005-06-28T06:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	then you would choose "default" for your E session
2005-06-28T06:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	from memory, menus for elightenment also need to be hand-hacked
2005-06-28T07:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	in gnome you usually just drag it onto the themes dialog
2005-06-28T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	yes, that usually is all you need to do
2005-06-28T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	else put it in ~/.themes
2005-06-28T07:31:00.000Z	ThE__OnE	thoreauputic	do i have to save it after i drag it onto the theme dialog?
2005-06-28T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	you shpouldn't need to, no - look in the "details" tab to see what's there
2005-06-28T07:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	right - if it installed correctly you should see some new stuff
2005-06-28T07:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	no, it should be untarred into .themes, so you can trash it if you want to
2005-06-28T07:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	I tend to keep tarballs in a dir called "tarballs" - they can be handy to have around in the future   ;)
2005-06-28T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	about:config - search for subVendor and edit the string to 1.0.4
2005-06-28T08:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	sorry that should be vendorSub
2005-06-28T11:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ThE__OnE	are you behind NAT or proxy?
