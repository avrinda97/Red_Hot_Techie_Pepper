2005-06-15T07:21:00.000Z	shadowjack		i don't understand, whenever i ask about accelerted drivers on the forum, they also respond like i'm an alien from another planet. is it really so odd to have accelerated drivers?
2005-06-15T07:21:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	not really
2005-06-15T07:22:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	for some, using accelerated drivers from vendor violates their personal philosophy about using open source only stuff
2005-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	google will not be so judgemental
2005-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	google has turned up nothing
2005-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	always worked fine for me, but i don't use vendorn stuff
2005-06-15T07:24:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	i know for a fact that google returns a huge number of hits on accerlated X stuff
2005-06-15T07:24:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	you know what, i can do without your superior nerd attitude "go google it" bullshit
2005-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	say something useful or shut up
2005-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	i wouldn't have suggest it I didn't personally google that exact same subject before
2005-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	and google certainly helped me with my acceralted X issue
2005-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	to each his own
2005-06-15T07:26:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	because i ALREADY DID IT AND TURNED UP NOTHING USEFUL
2005-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	dunno if this is relevant to your situ, but -> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-7832.html
2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	it sounds like it is but that's from the development release - you'd thing that would have been fixed by now?
2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	perhaps, i am unfamiliar with ubuntu so i can't say
2005-06-15T07:37:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	... you're in the #ubuntu channel
2005-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	yes, to get help and opinion on ubuntu distro
2005-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	here's an opinion - they haven't ironed out the automatic update manager introduced in the latest version
2005-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	any other issues you've experienced with the auto upd mgr besides vidia stuff?
2005-06-15T07:40:00.000Z	shadowjack	kudzubane	nope because i didn't get to run it very long before my system was borked
2005-06-15T07:40:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	sorry to hear that
2005-06-15T07:41:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	keeping an eye on the channel to determne possilbe roadblocks for my first ubuntu install on my lappy
2005-06-15T07:47:00.000Z	kudzubane	shadowjack	having irc'ed for a while, my skin is thick :)  no biggie
