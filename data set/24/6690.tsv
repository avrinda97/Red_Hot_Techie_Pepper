2005-08-22T16:09:00.000Z	titaniululz		i'd really like an ftpd for ubuntu that will just let me list a bunch of users/passwords and their file paths+permissions; i don't want to set up shells and such for each user, that's a bit excessive. any good servers i should try?
2005-08-22T16:10:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 pureftpd
2005-08-22T16:11:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	where is that? apt-get install pureftpd fails
2005-08-22T16:11:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 pureftpd.org
2005-08-22T16:13:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	looks cool, thanks
2005-08-22T16:20:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 yes, "dpkg -i filename.deb"
2005-08-22T16:20:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	thanks
2005-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	i installed pureftpd-common; what should i read now to learn how to start using it and configuring it?
2005-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 the documentation
2005-08-22T16:51:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 netstat | grep 21  perhaps
2005-08-22T16:54:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	i don't seem to be able to get pureftpd to start
2005-08-22T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 port 21 is reserved, only root can use ports lower than 1024
2005-08-22T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 so, either run pureftpd as root i guess (sudo) or choose a higher port
2005-08-22T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 the FAQ or docu doesnt say ?
2005-08-22T16:58:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 yes it is
2005-08-22T16:58:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	it says how to change ports but if i can run it on the default that'd be nice
2005-08-22T16:59:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 try running it with "sudo" then
2005-08-22T16:59:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	i'm using terminal as root
2005-08-22T16:59:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 hmm.. well quicktest a higher port
2005-08-22T05:00:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 then you're either running some service on port 21, or it's some other weird error.. tried netstat?
2005-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	how do i set it to run on startup? the docs say to add it to rc.local or boot.local but i don't have those files
2005-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 debian is different on startup stuff
2005-08-22T05:10:00.000Z	titaniululz	kemik	could i put it in xinitrc?
2005-08-22T05:12:00.000Z	kemik	titaniululz	 about the startup thing, you'll have to ask someone else or try google/wiki/forums..
