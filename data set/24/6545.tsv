2007-12-30T03:43:00.000Z	Task1		where should it be? what dir?
2007-12-30T03:45:00.000Z	Task1		when you run a bash command with sudo ... where should the file be?
2007-12-30T03:46:00.000Z	Task1		so when I run that command... and it says file not found what do I do?
2007-12-30T03:46:00.000Z	Task1		sudo bash ati-driver-installer-8.443.1-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy
2007-12-30T03:47:00.000Z	Task1		I run this command right here  :sudo bash ati-driver-installer-8.443.1-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy
2007-12-30T03:47:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	First, cd to the driectory where you saved the file.
2007-12-30T03:48:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	cd Desktop
2007-12-30T03:48:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	Sand then:  sh ./ati-driver-installer-8.42.3-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy
2007-12-30T03:53:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	No, just a terminal window
2007-12-30T03:54:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	And then, cd to the Desktop directory:  cd Desktop
2007-12-30T03:55:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	What is your "new problem"?
2007-12-30T03:55:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	So, you are in console mode only?  Is that what you are saying.
2007-12-30T03:56:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	Don't use gedit
2007-12-30T03:56:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	  sh ./ati-driver-installer-8.42.3-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy
2007-12-30T03:57:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	But first, what do you get when you type   pwd  ?
2007-12-30T03:57:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	cd Desktop
2007-12-30T03:58:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	NOW, what do you get when you type  pwd  ?
2007-12-30T03:59:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	  sh ./ati-driver-installer-8.42.3-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy
2007-12-30T04:01:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	Is it working for you?
2007-12-30T04:02:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	You'll do well to do a little research before shopping for hardware.
2007-12-30T04:03:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	Nvidia would be a better choice, (for a Linux user.)
2007-12-30T04:04:00.000Z	usr13	Task1	To tell the truth,  Nvidia has better driver software for both MS and Linux.
