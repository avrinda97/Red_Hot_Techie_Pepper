2007-04-14T12:38:00.000Z	henrik_		i mean about the installation
2007-04-14T12:39:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	It's not really hard
2007-04-14T12:33:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Welcome :) Are you replacing Windows?
2007-04-14T12:38:00.000Z	henrik_	MattJ	something i should know of, i'm a first time user of linux
2007-04-14T12:39:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	What kind of PC do you have?
2007-04-14T12:39:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	As in, how old... how much RAM... hard disk size...?
2007-04-14T12:41:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Wow, nice
2007-04-14T12:41:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	The 40GB, how is it at the moment? A partition, or free space?
2007-04-14T12:42:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Remove the partition, so you have the 40GB with no partitions in it
2007-04-14T12:43:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Then in the installer, you have the option to "Use largest continuous free space"
2007-04-14T12:43:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	and that should do everything for you
2007-04-14T12:43:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Yes, you can. There is a partition manager
2007-04-14T12:44:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	I don't think you'll have any problems :)
2007-04-14T12:44:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	brb
2007-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	I forgot... how do you access the internet?
2007-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Ah, ok (I have a useless USB modem, which I had to get drivers for first)
2007-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	You should be able to, yes
2007-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	Assuming you know the settings you need to connect
2007-04-14T13:07:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	You're in Windows?
2007-04-14T13:07:00.000Z	MattJ	henrik_	I've no idea what the autorun starts up
