2011-07-29T18:18:00.000Z	tyler_d		what is the default display driver in ubuntu called please?
2011-07-29T18:20:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	that depends on your graphic card. There isn't something like the ultimative default driver
2011-07-29T18:21:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	I am running an nvidia gt330M ; alternately how would I figure out which driver(not the nvidia one) would be in use?
2011-07-29T18:24:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	the default driver is nouveau. start jockey, if the priprietary driver isn't enabled you are using nouveau
2011-07-29T18:26:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	ok, so with nouveau installed, what is the "driver" reference in xorg.conf please?
2011-07-29T18:27:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	reference? can you paste xorg.conf file?
2011-07-29T18:29:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	http://paste.ubuntu.com/654533/ <--- I only have the one created by nvidia-xconfig as I was trying to use the proprietary driver. I was forced to remove(not use) xorg.conf as a result of this in order to get a gui back
2011-07-29T18:30:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	it's the third driver calld nv, it's obsolete. what version of ubuntu are you currently using?
2011-07-29T18:30:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	11.04
2011-07-29T18:32:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	correct me if I'm wrong but "nv" doesn't exist in 11.04 anymore. Have you wrote that manually in the file or is it just an old file?
2011-07-29T18:32:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	flying by the seat of my pants, I believe you are correct. what should that read please?
2011-07-29T18:33:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	p.s. manually configured
2011-07-29T18:33:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	why have you wrote "nv" in the file? Are you using old documentaries?
2011-07-29T18:38:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	try to remove the xorg.conf file and start jockey and enable the proprietary driver, reboot and it should work
2011-07-29T18:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	what is "jockey" please?
2011-07-29T18:39:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	that additional-driver-dailog-thing
2011-07-29T18:42:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	apt-get install jockey?
2011-07-29T18:42:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	no, jockey is preinstalled, it should be called "Additional Driver" in the menu (or similar)
2011-07-29T18:43:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	sorry, which menu are you refering to ?
2011-07-29T18:44:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	nevermind, just type "jockey-gtk" in terminal
2011-07-29T18:48:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	under driver, what does your machine have listed? ie. nv?
2011-07-29T18:50:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	nv is dead. Usually "nvidia-current", its the priprietary driver
2011-07-29T18:50:00.000Z	tyler_d	Incarus6	that. is fantastic, tyvm guys
2011-07-29T18:52:00.000Z	Incarus6	tyler_d	you're welcome
