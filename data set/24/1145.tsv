2010-06-18T22:50:00.000Z	hardfire		how can that be done ?
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	hardfire		soyo: how ?
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	hardfire		hmm ! kinda need a explanatino !
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	unop	hardfire	or setup mysql on the network .
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	hardfire		its the same machine!
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	unop	hardfire	ok, that doesn't preclude using the network.
2010-06-18T22:51:00.000Z	hardfire		want to access the same db when m on windows and when m on ubuntu
2010-06-18T22:52:00.000Z	hardfire		exactly
2010-06-18T22:52:00.000Z	hardfire		hardfire
2010-06-18T22:52:00.000Z	hardfire		yeah! no big deal
2010-06-18T22:52:00.000Z	hardfire		any options i have ?
2010-06-18T22:52:00.000Z	unop	hardfire	what i mean is just because windows and ubuntu are on the same machine doesn't mean you can't setup mysql with networking capabilities that allows you to access it from both OSes.
2010-06-18T22:53:00.000Z	hardfire		can't i change the data folder for ubuntu mysql to a common place and then have the same mysql both sides
2010-06-18T22:53:00.000Z	hardfire		would that work ?
2010-06-18T22:54:00.000Z	hardfire		hm ! ok ! gotta try changing the mysql data folder link
2010-06-18T22:54:00.000Z	hardfire		that's what i currently do
2010-06-18T22:54:00.000Z	hardfire		searching for a better option
2010-06-18T22:55:00.000Z	unop	hardfire	I wouldn't recommend that -- different versions of mysql operating on your data and all bets are off.
2010-06-18T22:55:00.000Z	hardfire		ok ! wh
2010-06-18T22:55:00.000Z	hardfire		what if i sync the same mysql versino both ways ?
2010-06-18T22:56:00.000Z	unop	hardfire	/join #mysql and ask for advice about this there -- it's getting to be offtopic.
2010-06-18T22:58:00.000Z	hardfire	unop	cannot says cannot send to channel
