2007-06-06T15:18:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	You need the kernel-sources / headers
2007-06-06T15:18:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	The right ones? He's telling you the kernel-version he wants
2007-06-06T15:20:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	cd /
2007-06-06T15:20:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	sudo find * | grep 2.6.20-16-generic
2007-06-06T15:22:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	got em ?
2007-06-06T15:22:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	nope, that command didn't do anything
2007-06-06T15:24:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	I doubt it did nothing, in fact it found EVERYTHING on your computer, the grep option filters. And so I guess you did NOT install the SOURCES
2007-06-06T15:27:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	Wait, i'll look
2007-06-06T15:30:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	any luck?
2007-06-06T15:31:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	patience, I'm also working here :-)
2007-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	sorry, i wasn't trying to rush you, i'vejust grown accustomed to people abandoning a cause
2007-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	Did you install linux-source-2.6.20 ?
2007-06-06T15:34:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	yes, have that installed
2007-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	it jsut doesn't appear to be found, or it's in the wrong directory, or something.
2007-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	45seconds to download
2007-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	kk
2007-06-06T15:38:00.000Z	_tilman	ymelaptop	I downloaded linux-source-2.6.20 and see:
2007-06-06T15:39:00.000Z	ymelaptop	_tilman	they are in /lib/modules/? and there is a source directory in them?
