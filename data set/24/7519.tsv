2005-01-12T15:32:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	explain
2005-01-12T15:34:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Where exactly are you trying to create a new folder?
2005-01-12T15:37:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	How did you mount it?
2005-01-12T15:37:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	and what kind of filesystem is on it? A windows filesystem or linux?
2005-01-12T15:41:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	You probably just need to change permission on the directory where the new drive is mounted.
2005-01-12T15:41:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	fstab doesn't "see" anything. It's a static configuration file that you have to edit yourself, unless you have a nice GUI tool that does it for you (like Mandrake probably does).l
2005-01-12T15:42:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Do you know the device name of the new drive? /dev/hdb or something?
2005-01-12T15:43:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Ok. Did you create a single linux partition to use up the whole drive? It would be /dev/hdb1
2005-01-12T15:43:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	/dev/hdb is the drive, and /dev/hdb1 is the first primary partition on that drive
2005-01-12T15:44:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	You can check the permissions on the mount point by doing this command:  ls -l /home/carajean/drive2
2005-01-12T15:44:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	You can check the permissions on the mount point by doing this command:  ls -ld /home/carajean/drive2
2005-01-12T15:44:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Are you the only user who logs into that computer?
2005-01-12T15:45:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Have you learned about Unix permissions at all?
2005-01-12T15:46:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Ok. "root" is the name of the superuser account. I hope that you remember root's password.
2005-01-12T15:48:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Ok. The quickest solution is to change ownership of the mount point to your user. Right now that directory is owned by root, and only root has write permission. That's why you have been getting "permission denied" messages.
2005-01-12T15:48:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Get to a root shell and run this command:  chown carajean /home/carajean/drive2
2005-01-12T15:48:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Once you've done that, you will be able to write to that directory.
2005-01-12T15:49:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	In order for a partition to be automatically mounted when your system boots, it needs to be listed in /etc/fstab
2005-01-12T15:49:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	yes
2005-01-12T15:49:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	In the Linux world, usually "no news is good news" when you run a command.
2005-01-12T15:51:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	Do you know which filesystem type /dev/hdb1 is formatted with? ext2? ext3? reiserfs?
2005-01-12T15:52:00.000Z	JoePenguin	carajean	It sould work if you add a line like this to your fstab:  /dev/hdb1 /home/carajean/drive2 ext3 defaults 0 0
