2011-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	tcurdt		big trouble here ... I did update a few packages (sshd was one of them) on my ubuntu 10.04 vserver and now the sshd does no start anymore :-(
2011-01-26T07:04:00.000Z	tcurdt		no console but I still have access to the filesystem
2011-01-26T07:04:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	That makes is kind of hard to diagnose..
2011-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	Could you try to chroot into your server file system and try to start sshd by hand? Maybe it will give some useful output..
2011-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	indeed it does ... feels like printf debugging
2011-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	vserver .. all I have is the filesystem ... so I can access logs and configs ... but that's it
2011-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	I wonder if you can grep your logs for output from sshd
2011-01-26T07:07:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	already did ... first I had trouble with the ttys respawning over and over again ... move those files init.d event files away
2011-01-26T07:08:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	 Did you customize your SSH server in some way?
2011-01-26T07:09:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	nope ... which is why I went for the maintainer's version on install
2011-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	tried to sneak in the sshd startup into the cron startup (which does start) but that did not work for some reason
2011-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	only got init, udevd, cron and syslog running ... no other processes
2011-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	I was thinking you can run 'sshd' the command with verbose.
2011-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	run where?
2011-01-26T07:11:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	Find 'sshd' the executable and run it via a command line?
2011-01-26T07:12:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	well ... I don't have ssh access to that machine anymore - that is the problem :)
2011-01-26T07:12:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	all I got is filesystem level access
2011-01-26T07:13:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	I need ssh to log SOME sort of error in the syslogs.. else it's hard to tell...
2011-01-26T07:13:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	Or you can read the ssh logs.. or messages from your /var/log
2011-01-26T07:14:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	I can ... but nothing in there
2011-01-26T07:14:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	No mention of sshd?
2011-01-26T07:15:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	nope ... looked in daemon.log and syslog.log
2011-01-26T07:15:00.000Z	Diamondcite	tcurdt	Please have a look at messages
2011-01-26T07:17:00.000Z	tcurdt	Diamondcite	cleaned out the logs to see changes ... but messages did not get re-created ... so I guess that means nothing did get posted for "messages"
