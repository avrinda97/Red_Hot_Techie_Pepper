2006-01-17T06:40:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	oh, gparted, if that is what you mean
2006-01-17T06:40:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	yeah
2006-01-17T06:41:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	yeah dude quite safe
2006-01-17T06:41:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	the problem is: I tried re-sizing. At the end it said one of the changed things was busy and to reboot. I rebooted and nothing has happened
2006-01-17T06:41:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	hmm weird
2006-01-17T06:41:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	 I think I need to unmount the linux swap too?
2006-01-17T06:42:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	I am not sure about the umounting thing
2006-01-17T06:42:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	it doesnt have a password
2006-01-17T06:43:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	well, other than umount it.. what can I do?
2006-01-17T06:44:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	yeah try it
2006-01-17T06:44:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	I'm guessing it is 'umount /dev'   as all the hdas are /dev/something?
2006-01-17T06:45:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	oh I am not sure about that
2006-01-17T06:45:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	my mount list, if it helps:  http://pastebin.com/501778
2006-01-17T06:47:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	dont umount /dev I dont know whether that will have the correct effect
2006-01-17T06:48:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	then umount only that
2006-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	its /tmp I think
2006-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	so,  'umount /tmp'?
2006-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	yep
2006-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	only root can umount it. I need a root password for super user?
2006-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	just go sudo umount /tmp
2006-01-17T06:51:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	thats not it then hold on
2006-01-17T06:52:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	I dont think you can umount your swap
2006-01-17T06:54:00.000Z	Steve^	poningru	I'll try it again then. Thanks for the help. If it doesn't work I'll post a thread on the forums and go play with windows or something :P
2006-01-17T06:55:00.000Z	poningru	Steve^	I thought you already had linux
