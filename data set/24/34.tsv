2012-11-04T11:47:00.000Z	ArubaDods		I made a bootable usbdrive, with AntiX linux on it. it work fine on my new laptop. But on my Old laptop it does not. It give me the message that there is no bootabtle device (something like that).
2012-11-04T11:47:00.000Z	ArubaDods		Is there anyone who can tells me why?
2012-11-04T11:47:00.000Z	ArubaDods		ps. What I did was, sudo fdisk -l to see the usbdrive I wanted to make bootable sudo dd if=AntiX.iso of=/dev/sdx (in my case sdb).
2012-11-04T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	antiX linux isn't supported here

2012-11-04T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	if you want distro independant support, try #linux
2012-11-04T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	it's not ubuntu server
2012-11-04T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	the link I gave you takes you to the support channel of your distro
2012-11-04T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	Lubuntu is slightly lighter
2012-11-04T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	if you want super light, install ubuntu minimal then install openbox (no desktop needed) :)
2012-11-04T11:56:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	Ok thanks a lot. I use the ubuntu server, but sometimes I want to use only the minimal requierments for watching movies, because its hooked on one of my lcd
2012-11-04T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	that is pretty much as light as it gets, you may want to install slim as a login manager too
2012-11-04T11:57:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	I will test the openbox, thanks a lot. I will ask about the dd command somewhere else
2012-11-04T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	ubuntu minimal + Xorg + openbox is about 1.2Gb installed if memory serves
2012-11-04T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	if you use /etc/network/interfaces to configure networking you can save space there too :)
2012-11-04T12:03:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	ok thanks. I was looking for e text editor to save your messages in xfce. but could not find it. I open a terminal and type gedit :-)
2012-11-04T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	mousepad
2012-11-04T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	you can run:  sudo ln -s `which mousepad` /usr/bin/gedit     to make life easier :)
2012-11-04T12:06:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	is ubuntu minimal like a iso which I can download?
2012-11-04T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ArubaDods	a simple websearch would have turned that up. Saves you having to ask......
2012-11-04T12:08:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	haha...ok thanks. will search for it
2012-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	ArubaDods	ActionParsnip	Nice mini.iso, I have made a bootable usb using that iso with the dd command. And it worked! I am going to play around a little. :-) Thanks a lot.
