2008-08-15T05:17:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	set up an mta
2008-08-15T05:17:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	I need to setup a whole mta?
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	I can't use smtp or something?
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	how else do you expect your local mail client to forward to the outside world
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	an mta seems pretty heavyweight if all I want is to get email alerts
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	not really
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	your box has no way of going to the outside world
2008-08-15T05:18:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	no?  how could I setup a really simple mta for just this limited purpose?
2008-08-15T05:19:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	are you on a dsl / cable line at home ?
2008-08-15T05:19:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	yes
2008-08-15T05:19:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	then  you shouldn't set up a mail server
2008-08-15T05:19:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	?  I don't want a mail server...just want to send alerts to gmail acount
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	you need a mail server to get the mail from your box to the outside world
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	but you said I shouldn't set one up
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	correct
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	mail server are not for use on home lines
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	okay, so how should I get emails to my gmail account when cron fails?
2008-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	without some form of smtp server running, I don't see how you can
2008-08-15T05:27:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	would ssmtp do the trick for me?
2008-08-15T05:28:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	I personally don't think so, as smtp servers should not be run on home lines, and ISP's normally block them
2008-08-15T05:29:00.000Z	danhs	ikonia	why couldn't I just connect to gmail's smtp server?
2008-08-15T05:29:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	because you won't be able to authenticate
2008-08-15T05:29:00.000Z	ikonia	danhs	and cron is dumb in the way it mails out
