2006-01-06T14:32:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	should I try rebooting and see if that fixes it?
2006-01-06T14:40:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	reboot didn't work...still can't save to it
2006-01-06T14:43:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	yes..and I just checked by pico a file on that system and trying to save..and says its readonly file system
2006-01-06T14:45:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	well no error message
2006-01-06T14:46:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	but if try to save file still says read only
2006-01-06T14:48:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	everything in fstab is still the same..so not sure why its mounting as readonly
2006-01-06T14:51:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	no...it still don't let me save to it
2006-01-06T14:51:00.000Z	TokenBad	spiregrain	its not my main drive..its my slave drive
