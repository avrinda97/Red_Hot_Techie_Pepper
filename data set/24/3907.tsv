2007-09-09T16:27:00.000Z	echronicle		hello everyone
2007-09-09T16:28:00.000Z	echronicle		I just installed ubuntu as a dual boot partition on my pc, which was already running xp... but I think I lost xp.  Is there a way I can be sure whether I did or not?
2007-09-09T16:29:00.000Z	echronicle		Asfire908 - when I restarted from ubuntu, it just loaded linux automatically
2007-09-09T16:29:00.000Z	echronicle		no choice
2007-09-09T16:29:00.000Z	echronicle		Ashfire98 - it didn't even have a grub startup menu
2007-09-09T16:31:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	if you want to make sure your windows install is still there, start up gparted and look to see if there is an NTFS partition still on your drive
2007-09-09T16:50:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	have you started parted in your terminal? i believe the plan was to look for your windows partition to see if it still there
2007-09-09T16:50:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	- I started parted
2007-09-09T16:50:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	but... since I'm new, I'm not exactly sure what to do next
2007-09-09T16:51:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	i dont remember parted very well but ill start it up and see how to get through the menus, its pretty simple to find the basic partitioning scheme if i remember
2007-09-09T16:51:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	thanks, brb
2007-09-09T16:52:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	ok, I'm back and ready for whatever awaits me :)
2007-09-09T16:52:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	ok, done
2007-09-09T16:53:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	now look in the list of partitions it printed and see if there is a partition with File System "NTFS" -- that would be your windows partition assuming it is a standard XP setup
2007-09-09T16:54:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	primary, extended, and logical
2007-09-09T16:54:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	that is type, look in the next column, with "File System" as the header, is there one of type NTFS or is just ext3 and swap?
2007-09-09T16:55:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	- ext3 and swap, and the middle one is blank
2007-09-09T16:57:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	from that partition table it looks like your windows install got nuked
2007-09-09T05:01:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	- are you still there?
2007-09-09T05:02:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	what is your goal? to reinstall windows and ubuntu?
2007-09-09T05:03:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	I believe the windows installer can wipe your HD and install itself, right? In that case, I'd just reinstall windows, then reinstall ubuntu but using manual partitioning to make sure you preserve your data
2007-09-09T05:03:00.000Z	echronicle	mycroftiv	- thanks! so, I just put in the windows xp cd and reboot?
2007-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	I'm not much of a windows user, maybe google "windows xp installation" to make sure it will clear everything out
2007-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	mycroftiv	echronicle	but if all your data is gone and your system isnt setup how you want, you cant make it any worse i guess so go for it
