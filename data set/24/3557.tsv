2008-06-29T00:14:00.000Z	sofiankrt		how do I store a scripts pid as a variable in the script itself when it is run?
2008-06-29T00:15:00.000Z	sofiankrt		I'm running this script many times
2008-06-29T00:15:00.000Z	sofiankrt		and I need each one to store its own vip
2008-06-29T00:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 you may want to check the advanced bash scripting guide for examples.
2008-06-29T00:16:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 running it many times.. is going to have many different pids..
2008-06-29T00:16:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	exactly
2008-06-29T00:17:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	so, for example
2008-06-29T00:17:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 thats how any program works.
2008-06-29T00:17:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	if I run it now
2008-06-29T00:17:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	it returns its current pid
2008-06-29T00:17:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	it's for sofiankrt.infinites.net/bin/track
2008-06-29T00:18:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	the problem I'm facing is that if I run the same script for multiple contacts, when one logs out all of them will get the sigterm
2008-06-29T00:20:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	any ideas?
2008-06-29T00:21:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 not really, not clear on what you are doing. I would say check that ABS guide for examples of catching the signals.   or there may be some other better way to do what you are trying to do.
2008-06-29T00:22:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	I am catching the signal, my problem is that if I run multiple instances of the script, all of them will catch the signal
2008-06-29T00:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 sounds like a rather advanced bash topic. Ive not had to mess with that aspect of bash. so cant help.
2008-06-29T00:24:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	I'll try asking in #bash, my email address is on the website if you want to contact me
2008-06-29T00:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 that url timed out. :)
2008-06-29T00:24:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	lol, sofiankrt@gmail.com
2008-06-29T00:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis	sofiankrt	 it may be bash is not the best tool for the job in this case. :)
2008-06-29T00:27:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	thanks anyway, bye
2008-06-29T00:41:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	they totally ignored me!
2008-06-29T00:41:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	couldn't find anything
2008-06-29T00:44:00.000Z	sofiankrt	dr_Willis	when I run track &, I get a pid. any chance I can save that pid and kill that exact process using it?
