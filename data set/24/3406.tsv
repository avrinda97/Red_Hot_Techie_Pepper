2008-02-03T15:19:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		and no amount of changing colour settings in 'login screens' gets rid of it.
2008-02-03T15:20:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		after login, before metacity, to clarify.
2008-02-03T15:21:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		(why did ubuntu have to have default colours no one seems to like?)
2008-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		so travis_ avis Slart qinjuehang we all have the same problem... anyone got a fix? :P
2008-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	I just got one
2008-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	sudo gedit /etc/gdm/PreSession/Default
2008-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	oh sorry, i missed that.
2008-02-03T15:28:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	wwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah thank you thank you!!! no more ugly colours!
2008-02-03T15:28:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	lol...*runs in the opposite direction*
2008-02-03T15:31:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	i have read that ms office handles bigger documents better than openoffice does.
2008-02-03T15:32:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	I think its cuz OO compresses its files
2008-02-03T15:32:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	that should not affect anything while you're viewing an open file.
2008-02-03T15:33:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	Don't forgect, it might hang on auto-save
2008-02-03T15:33:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	what msoffice or openoffice?
2008-02-03T15:38:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	Differenciate them by the full-stop?
2008-02-03T15:38:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	i do, but sometimes, it's easier on the eyes if they're shaded different, like in konqueror or thunar, neither of which im too keen on, though they have some interesting features.
2008-02-03T15:39:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	I use thunar half the time :) Xfce is my friend for OpenGl apps (Blender)
2008-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	which brings me to my other question. how do i get thunar to integrate into gnome? so that when i open a folder, it opens in thunar instead, and when i delete an object, it goes to thunar's trash, or alternately, that thunar adopts .Trash?
2008-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	I thing in gconf, you can set your default file-browser. But don't forget that your desktop is managed by nautilus, so...
2008-02-03T15:42:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	that was exactly my point.
2008-02-03T15:43:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	Ok, I don't think Thunar can manage a desktop. But let me check
2008-02-03T15:44:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	ok.
2008-02-03T15:46:00.000Z	qinjuehang	L3ttuc3	I AM not a native english speaker. Sadly I don't speak Swedish too :)
2008-02-03T15:50:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	qinjuehang	any advances on thunar/nautilus?
