2005-09-21T05:26:00.000Z	orangey		incidentally, how far away are we from breezy?
2005-09-21T05:27:00.000Z	orangey		woah!! that's awesome.
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	orangey		so, y'all recommend the move to breezy now?
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	orangey		or wait?
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	transgress	orangey	what do you have installed?  ubuntu-desktop?  kubuntu-desktop?
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	orangey		incidentally, I'm a kubuntu user.
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	transgress	orangey	only?
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	pretty much.. I think there may be some ubuntu-base in there
2005-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	transgress	orangey	if you only have kubuntu-desktop, it'll go over like a breeze
2005-09-21T05:29:00.000Z	transgress		if you have both... it doesn't go so well
2005-09-21T05:29:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	hurricane-force breeze?
2005-09-21T05:29:00.000Z	transgress		ha
2005-09-21T05:29:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	and if only ubuntu-desktop?
2005-09-21T05:29:00.000Z	transgress		haven't done that one
2005-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	transgress		but i've done a mix on two systems, and it has acted screwy both times
2005-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	ok.. but we're really close to october 13..
2005-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	transgress		and i've done kubuntu only on two, plus after8 said his kubuntu only worked grand
2005-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	orangey		is it that lots of the work will happen in the next month?
2005-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	transgress		on this box i'm talking with i did a dist-upgrade w/ kubuntu only, then did an aptitude install ubuntu-desktop afterwards and it works great
2005-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	transgress		so... i wonder with windoze64 if flash will compile a 64bit version anytime soon...
2005-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	transgress		maybe i will
2005-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	transgress		well adobe now
2005-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	ubuntu-desktop is half there..
2005-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	orangey	transgress	I'll let you know how it goes, but I'll likely wait a week or two before upgrading.. : )
