2007-09-22T10:04:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	try gksudo hp-setup for printer setup?
2007-09-22T10:06:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	gksudo hp-setup shows no printers recognized
2007-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	mm, guess HPLIP no support your printer
2007-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	what is HPLIP
2007-09-22T10:07:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	HP's official Linux printer driver
2007-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	hey look at my log of what happens when i run sudo gksudo hp-setup: http://rafb.net/p/FFxzft84.html
2007-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	any idea from that what is happening?
2007-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	thats not how you run it :)
2007-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	just gksudo hp-setup since hp-setup is GUI
2007-09-22T10:08:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	and gksudo is your GUI sudo
2007-09-22T10:09:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	scguy318 ok. well i just did it that way too, and i get the same thing
2007-09-22T10:09:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	lemme paste the new log
2007-09-22T10:09:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	http://rafb.net/p/6jIkUp32.html <-- this is the new printer log from gksudo
2007-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	does no GUI window open?
2007-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	the gui wnidow opened, and i tried searching for a local printer, but none were detected
2007-09-22T10:10:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	:(
2007-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	do look at Scuzini's link: http://www.linuxcompatible.org/compatdbprint18146.html
2007-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	why does it get detected when i run the print manager gui from system->administration but not by this program
2007-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	probably cuz HPLIP doesn't support your printer
2007-09-22T10:11:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	damn!
2007-09-22T10:12:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	look at Scunizi's link
2007-09-22T10:12:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	i am
2007-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	b14ck	scguy318	hrm. i followed the guide, but still not getting any results
2007-09-30T05:36:00.000Z	scguy318	b14ck	i think not, pretty streamlined since server ;)
