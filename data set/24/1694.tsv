2010-06-29T23:43:00.000Z	pfifo		what is the difference between the server livecd and the alternate livecd
2010-06-29T23:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	They both use the same installer, and if you go into the advanced menus they both can install either Desktop or Server (or any other configuration). The difference is just what packages are contained on the CD itself and what is installed by default.
2010-06-29T23:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Yes.
2010-06-29T23:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Yes, Ubuntu is just a huge set of interchangeable packages. Anything is possible.
2010-06-29T23:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	You can't fit much on a floppy.
2011-04-18T07:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	When helping others please don't recommend editing the grub.cfg directly as most users want their changes to be persistant and are using update-grub to keep their grub.cfg up to date (the default in Ubuntu) rather than writing it manually.
2011-04-18T07:13:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	ok
2011-06-18T23:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	No.
2011-07-10T23:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	It's the other way around, you can't have cross filesystem hardlinks.
2011-07-11T08:47:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	there is a best game
2012-09-22T03:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Why do you want an old kernel?
2012-09-22T03:21:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	for the module at http://eeepc-linux.googlecode.com
2012-09-22T03:24:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	so can I get an official one or do I need to compile my own?
2012-09-22T03:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Why do you think that you need this particular module?
2012-09-22T03:29:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	google referred me to this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC/Using#Overclocking not the Overclocking part
2012-09-22T03:37:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	any other questions or comments?
2012-09-22T03:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Do you have a file /proc/eee/fsb currently?
2012-09-22T03:49:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	no, i dont
2012-09-22T03:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	If you run "sudo modprobe eeepc-laptop" does it cause the file to appear?
2012-09-22T03:54:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	well, the module loads fine and shows up in an lsmod, but /proc/eee/fsb is not created
2012-09-22T04:10:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	would you recommend using 10.04 since I need an older kernel? Or should I compile a mainline kernel? This is for a livecd so I dont expect to do many upgrades or install lots of software.
2012-09-22T04:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	What will this liveCD be used for? Why is overclocking so important for you?
2012-09-22T04:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pfifo	Also, it's possible that the module will build against a modern kernel.
2012-09-22T04:14:00.000Z	pfifo	Jordan_U	well I use grub2's iso boot on my eeepc to save MASSIVE disk space, I like to customize the lubuntu or xubuntu livecd's to include a few extra things, and since I can easily include overclocking support I want it. My computer's battery only lasts about 10 minutes so power usage is of no concern... Also I tried to build aginst 3.2.0-23-generic but the build fails
