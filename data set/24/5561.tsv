2011-02-07T00:56:00.000Z	ubuntu__	jrib	can you explain this to me? http://paste.ubuntu.com/563540/ I need to remove bad sectors from hard disk because after using the disk a while the fonts disappear and stuff so something is wrong..

2011-02-07T01:00:00.000Z	ubuntu__	jrib	thanks so much for the help, have a good evening
2011-02-07T01:24:00.000Z	ubuntu__	jrib	sorry to bother you again, is fsck -pcfv the proper command to mark bad sectors? it seems to still be executing with no result..
