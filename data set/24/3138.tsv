2008-06-12T15:28:00.000Z	laeg		i am using this script ( http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/19568/ ) to launch a program in a dedicated x server but when i do it i just get a black and white pixelated screen with an X cursor - how can i remedy this?
2008-06-12T15:30:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	try http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/19610/ in place of the last bit
2008-06-12T15:36:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	ty, same again but this was the closing line in terminal - laeg@skyrocket:~/Desktop$ FreeFontPath: FPE "/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc" refcount is 2, should be 1; fixing.
2008-06-12T15:37:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	instead of wine wow.exe, try xterm; see if that brings up a terminal
2008-06-12T15:38:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	i don't follow you, you want me to replace 'wine wow.exe' in the script with 'xterm'?
2008-06-12T15:39:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	yes it brought up a terminal in the top right of the screen with the same black and white pixelated screen behind it
2008-06-12T15:39:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	try running wine WoW.exe (or whatever) from inside that terminal
2008-06-12T15:42:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	i tried wine.Wow.exe in the warcraft dir but it says /home/laeg/.wine 'is not owned by you'
2008-06-12T15:42:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	i also tried it with sudo
2008-06-12T15:44:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	can you run it from your normal X display?
2008-06-12T15:45:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	yes
2008-06-12T15:48:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	can you run 'whoami' in the lone xterm on display :3 and '
2008-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	it says i am root though i'm not logged in as root here on my main x server. what do you need from the output of the second command? i can't copy and paste between x servers
2008-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	is it owned by you (laeg)?
2008-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	it is owned by laeg and the group laeg yup
2008-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	but you say whoami says you're root?
2008-06-12T15:53:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	did you start the X server (run the script) as root?
2008-06-12T15:53:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	i had to use sudo
2008-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	because when i do it without sudo it tells me i can;t
2008-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	without sudo it tells me X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting.
2008-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	ah...  you can start the script from the console (hit ctrl-alt-F1, then log in , then run the script as yourself) ...try that first to make sure it works
2008-06-12T16:00:00.000Z	askvictor	laeg	gtg; goodluck
2008-06-12T16:00:00.000Z	laeg	askvictor	i did that, it told me i'm not authorised to run it just like when i run it in this x
