2009-05-05T17:21:00.000Z	indus		su is switch user i believe
2009-05-05T17:21:00.000Z	indus		su -i
2009-05-05T17:23:00.000Z	indus		you get a root terminal
2009-05-05T17:24:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	sudo -s, then passwd to set a password on the root account.
2009-05-05T17:25:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	thanks let me try
2009-05-05T17:25:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	but i always use sudo su and use root terminal
2009-05-05T17:27:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	Yes, sudo -s is the same as sudo su. If you really want to set a password on the root account, you can do so with passwd. You'll find, however, that neither canonical or #ubuntu will support that. It's not really needed for most things.
2009-05-05T17:28:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	because i used system password and got root account
2009-05-05T17:28:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	hmm so just typing su in terminal needs root password hmm
2009-05-05T17:28:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	no wonder i couldnt log in
2009-05-05T17:28:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	you need to set a root password before you can use it.
2009-05-05T17:28:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	Exactly.
2009-05-05T17:29:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	can you tell me that root pasword step again
2009-05-05T17:31:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	You can sudo -s to get a root terminal, then set the password with the command passwd. I'd reinforce the comments of others that you really shouldn't set a root password or use the root account unless you know precicely what you're doing. :)
2009-05-05T17:32:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	using sudo -s immediately asks for password ? how do i set it then
2009-05-05T17:35:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	heh i figured it our
2009-05-05T17:35:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	Good. Remember we won't be able to help you if you break it. :)
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	what can i break?
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	we can break everyhing with sudo also no?
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	You can break the whole system. In theory, you could delete every file in the operating system.
2009-05-05T17:36:00.000Z	cybersplice	indus	Correct.
2009-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	indus	cybersplice	thanks a lot , learnt a few things
