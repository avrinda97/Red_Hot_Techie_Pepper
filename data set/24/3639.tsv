2012-10-16T20:06:00.000Z	michealPW		Is ext4 the only one that provides robust journaling?
2012-10-16T20:06:00.000Z	michealPW		Or does ext3 also do journaling?
2012-10-16T20:06:00.000Z	michealPW		Hrmm
2012-10-16T20:07:00.000Z	michealPW		Hrmm!
2012-10-16T20:09:00.000Z	michealPW		TimothA: There's a good guide that fully explains the Linux filesystem (How it's organized, now the actual filesystems hehe) if you're interested?
2012-10-16T20:09:00.000Z	michealPW		K, let me get you the link mate ;)
2012-10-16T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	that's not worth anything if ubuntu doesn't follow it
2012-10-16T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	TimothyA is right, it's where the ubuntu mysql database datafiles are stored
2012-10-16T20:12:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	Right, readign that FHS should help TimothyA find a more appropriate location for his databases... I didn't know Ubuntu mysql put the dbs there, though, that's odd :\
2012-10-16T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	it's not odd, most distros put them there
2012-10-16T20:14:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	It's weird that any distro would put them there. I guess it might be becomming a de facto standard but it still doesn't make a lot of sense to me after reading FHS haha :\
2012-10-16T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	stop quoting things like FHS - no-one has "signed up" to follow it, so it's worthless
2012-10-16T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	right, so what's the point in quoting it to people
2012-10-16T20:15:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	If more people are aware, more people can request that Canonical adhere to the standard right?
2012-10-16T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	no, you can't request anything
2012-10-16T20:15:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	If a large group of users requested Canonical adhere to a standard, you don't think they would listen? :\
2012-10-16T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	no, they don't care because it doesn't matter
2012-10-16T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	of course they would not listen,
2012-10-16T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	what does it matter, why change it because someone random wrote a document called the FHS
2012-10-16T20:17:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	There should be a LSB, IMHO, which would also require a standard filesystem hierarchy. I believe if there actually was an agreed-upon standard game companies wouldn't ahve such a hard time targeting Linux? :\
2012-10-16T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	this is nothing to do with ubuntu
2012-10-16T20:18:00.000Z	michealPW	ikonia	How can it not have anything to do with Ubuntu when it's [Ubuntu] the fastest growing Linux distribution? :\
2012-10-16T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	because this channel is for ubuntu techanical support and you stating some sort of idealistic approach that matters not doesn't really help
2012-10-16T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	michealPW	it's not a cop out, it's exactly what I've said it is, now please stop
