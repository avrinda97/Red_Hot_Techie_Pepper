2010-05-01T02:43:00.000Z	Guest20927		Hello.
2010-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	Guest20927		May  I get some help?
2010-05-01T02:45:00.000Z	Guest20927		May I get some help?
2010-05-01T02:45:00.000Z	Guest20927		Specifically, on how to get my live CD to boot.
2010-05-01T02:46:00.000Z	Guest20927		More specifically, on how to force the Vesa driver.
2010-05-01T02:46:00.000Z	Guest20927		Lol, I'm not going to get any help with almost 2000 people here.
2010-05-01T02:47:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	if you do not ask
2010-05-01T02:56:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes does this apply to your chipset/case?
2010-05-01T02:56:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	Thanks for the reply, I will see.
2010-05-01T03:01:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	Thanks again for your replay. My chipset was the later i915 which, after digging around, I found that KMS has issues with it. I tried turning mode setting off and forcing the Vesa driver in the syslinux.cfg file that unetbootin generated. It didn't work.
2010-05-01T03:02:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	I either get a black screen, or a fuzzy screen with blobs of color.
2010-05-01T03:10:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	this is the channel to ask really
2010-05-01T03:13:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	Well, I seemed to be on the right track with you but you seem to be flooded with help requests and no one else seems to have any suggestions.
2010-05-01T03:18:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	You were not responding.
2010-05-01T03:22:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	there is a directory on the stick in any case with kernel boot options
2010-05-01T03:19:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	are you making a bootable cd or something that you are tinkering with syslinux?
2010-05-01T03:20:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	the stuff on the wiki deals with how to modify grub/ubuntu install to makre sure it will boot
2010-05-01T03:21:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	It's a live flash drive.
2010-05-01T03:21:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	ah a live usb stick kind of approach
2010-05-01T03:22:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	not to familiar with that, does syslinux even use grub as a second stage?
2010-05-01T03:22:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	Yeah, I took out 'quiet splash' and added 'i1915.modeset=0' and 'xforcevesa'
2010-05-01T03:23:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	*i915.modeset=0
2010-05-01T03:23:00.000Z	acicula	Guest20927	the wiki suggests 1 not 0
2010-05-01T03:24:00.000Z	Guest20927	acicula	Lol, I'll try that. I'll feel pretty dull if it works. Thanks for the replies.
