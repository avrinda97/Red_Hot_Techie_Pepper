2005-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	reiki		can anyone give me a hand figuring out why my USB flash drive doesn't show up on my desktop when the system can see that it's plugged in? I also don't know how to unmount it ...unless I just do that from terminal
2005-09-16T06:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	System -> Preferences -> Removable Media and Disks, make sure you have the correct options set
2005-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	those settings appear to be correct
2005-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	okay, then in a terminal, type gnome-volume-manager
2005-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	: should I sudo that?
2005-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	nope
2005-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	yeah...weird. okay, try putting a drive-mount applet in your panel and see if that helps
2005-09-16T06:57:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	drive mount works when I insert a cdrom... will this break anything? :)
2005-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	i have my drives show up in the applet when i insert stuff in there
2005-09-23T06:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	it should just work, and photo importer should import photos automagically
2005-09-23T06:59:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	that would just be too easy :)  thanks!
2005-09-23T06:59:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	it doesn't remove them from the camera when it imports them does it?
2005-09-23T06:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	i don't think so
2005-09-23T07:00:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	ok thanks
2005-09-23T07:00:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	i only did it once, and it worked very well on my friends camera
2005-09-23T07:00:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	ok... I'll give it a go
2005-09-23T07:03:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	amazing... not only discovered the camera and opened photo importer, but also correctly identified the camera and it does have a checkbox to remove them from the camera after importing. Absolutely brilliant.
2005-09-23T07:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	:)
2005-09-23T07:05:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	do we have to dismount the camera somehow? Or just unplug it when we're done?
2005-09-23T07:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	try to unmount it, and then unplug. i am pretty sure that it mounts it as a usb disk :)
2005-09-23T07:08:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	I can't see it mounted in /media ... hmmmmm
2005-10-19T05:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	you don't have to if you don't want to!
2005-10-19T05:25:00.000Z	reiki	robotgeek	ok... then I'm amazed! :)
2005-10-19T05:26:00.000Z	robotgeek	reiki	though for kernel updates to be applied, you would need a reboot. i guess anything not being used is updated and can be used immediately
