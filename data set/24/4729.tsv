2007-01-25T15:31:00.000Z	mtdoo		i'm installing ubuntu.. i'm on step 5 of 6. i choose 2 gb partition for swap and 32 gb for "/" but i keep getting an error message "no root file system".. any ideas?
2007-01-25T15:32:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Did you put swap before root?
2007-01-25T15:32:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	yess
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	i switched it but still the same message
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	should i format the partitions first???
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	i'm trying to install windows xp and ubuntu
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Hmm..I just installed last night. I had a similar problem. How many partitions do you have? Are you trying to dual boot?
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Ah, me too. The problem I ran into was that my ntfs partition (Windows) could not be resized. So I had to reformat everything after backing it up
2007-01-25T15:33:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	i have 4 partitions.. 1 = xp, 2 = xp, 3 = swap, 4 = /
2007-01-25T15:34:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	but why would it need to resize partitions used by windows ?
2007-01-25T15:34:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Why do you have 2 XP partitions? Are they for specialized activity? (ie gaming?
2007-01-25T15:34:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Well, you can only have 4 primary partitions too.
2007-01-25T15:34:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	no.. just for different used
2007-01-25T15:35:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	i don't want to reformat anything.. already got my windows xp instances installed
2007-01-25T15:35:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	You might need to rid yourself of one. Installing Ubuntu generally takes 2 new partitions, and the max you can have is 4.
2007-01-25T15:35:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	well i have 4
2007-01-25T15:35:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	so this should not be a problem
2007-01-25T15:35:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Okay. Hmm
2007-01-25T15:36:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	i'm just thinking the 'no root file system' is vague
2007-01-25T15:36:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	mtdoo	Did you make the swap tag 'linux swap' and the root partition ext3?
2007-01-25T15:36:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	where would i do that??
2007-01-25T15:37:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	step 5 has 2 sub-steps before step 6
2007-01-25T15:38:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	the first step in step 5 doesn't let me do anything.. it just shows the filesystem type as unknown
2007-01-25T15:50:00.000Z	mtdoo	AmbientMstr	where's the option for ext2 vs ext3??
