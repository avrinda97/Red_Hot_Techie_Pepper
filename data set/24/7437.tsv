2004-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	jmhodges		my grub-fu is weak
2004-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	What's the problem?
2004-12-03T07:38:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	that right there ^ :)
2004-12-03T07:40:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	What have you tried so far?
2004-12-03T07:41:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	chroot and running grub-install, running grub-install from the cd with --config-file pointed to the one i had on the harddrive
2004-12-03T07:41:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	With what as the target device?
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	/dev/hda
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	I think `grub-install /dev/hda` should do the trick. (You might want to add "--no-floppy" if you don't have a floppy drive.
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	from where?
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	Hmm, than apparently it _didn't_ do the trick...
2004-12-03T07:42:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	oh i tried that
2004-12-03T07:43:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	I don't think you can do it from a chroot, but I'm not sure.
2004-12-03T07:43:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	nope, i dont think i can either heh
2004-12-03T07:43:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	I'm not sure the chrooted env will recognize /dev/hda
2004-12-03T07:43:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	well, grub-install /dev/hda is doing something
2004-12-03T07:44:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	"Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device."
2004-12-03T07:45:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	Try something like: grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/hda1/boot/grub/ /dev/hda  (but change the --root-dir path to your installations grub-dir.)
2004-12-03T07:46:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	actually i think thats correct
2004-12-03T07:46:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	It's great if it is. :)
2004-12-03T07:46:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	from yours.. i tried this before "cp: listing attributes of `//lib/grub/i386-pc/stage1': Unknown error 524"
2004-12-03T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	Hmm...
2004-12-03T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	jmhodges	I hate unknown errors.
2004-12-04T10:40:00.000Z	jmhodges	madsen	the fix from last night didnt work :-/
