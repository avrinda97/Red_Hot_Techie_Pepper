2008-03-31T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	it very much depends on your graphics cards and drivers
2008-03-31T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	that could be one of the problems
2008-03-31T13:05:00.000Z	WilcoJR	ikonia	 how so ? 169.12 is the latest so far it works wonderfully for me - much better h the built in 100 drivers that came with ubuntu
2008-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	well that proves how lack of understanding you have
2008-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	WilcoJR	ikonia	 - can you please explain ?
2008-03-31T13:07:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	the versions of the nvidia driver will have different stability / compatability depending ont he version of the kernel you run and the applications it runs with, ubuntu test the versions they support, you've used later drivers that may have issues witht hat version of the kernel/compiz/ubuntu in general
2008-03-31T13:07:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	it's not an issue with the kernel, re-read what I typed
2008-03-31T13:08:00.000Z	WilcoJR	ikonia	 let me rephrase kernel/driver compatibilty
2008-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	it's a beta
2008-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	re-read what I typed
2008-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	WilcoJR	ikonia	 i read and understand
2008-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	clearly you don't
2008-03-31T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	only drivers supported by ubuntu (restricted driver manager)
2008-03-31T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	manage ssh sessions ?
2008-03-31T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	disable the wirless card only
2008-03-31T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	disble the card then
2008-03-31T13:14:00.000Z	WilcoJR	ikonia	 manage ssh sessiosn = SecureCRT for windows is a terminal/ssh proggy that lets you store and create organized tree of all your server connections
2008-03-31T13:14:00.000Z	ikonia	WilcoJR	putty
