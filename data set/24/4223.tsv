2007-06-10T07:48:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	files are not in .trash
2007-06-10T07:49:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	did you run nautilus as root or is the place you deleted the files from mounted under root?
2007-06-10T07:50:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	yes maybe it was run under root, but sudo ls -la dont show it either
2007-06-10T07:52:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	which trash folder?
2007-06-10T07:52:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	/home/username/.Trash
2007-06-10T07:52:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	if it was run under root, it'd be in root's trash
2007-06-10T07:52:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	methinks
2007-06-10T07:53:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	i running ubuntu, and i dont have a root username
2007-06-10T07:53:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	check if you have a /root/.Trash folder
2007-06-10T07:54:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	but this files were in a ntfs partition
2007-06-10T07:55:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	ah, i'm not sure where the data would be moved then.  so you don't have a /root/.Trash?
2007-06-10T07:56:00.000Z	Pirolocito	orbin	no
2007-06-10T07:59:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	might be worth something: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2605363
2007-06-10T07:59:00.000Z	orbin	Pirolocito	i assume you have ntfs-3g or some such to be able to delete the file/s
