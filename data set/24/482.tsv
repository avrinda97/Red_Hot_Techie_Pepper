2012-08-11T01:32:00.000Z	hollenjf		I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu, it wont auto mount my sdcard, its not in dmesg and fdisk -l isnt listing it. is there a change I should know about?
2012-08-11T01:33:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	when you say "latest" do you mean 12.04 or 12.10?
2012-08-11T01:34:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	12.04 that latest stable release
2012-08-11T01:35:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	have you upgraded from a older version of ubuntu?
2012-08-11T01:35:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	yes, 11 and the earlty 12 release used to auto mount the sd card devices
2012-08-11T01:35:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	No, I have done a clean install from an ISO
2012-08-11T01:36:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	hmmm no idea you might try googling
2012-08-11T01:36:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	Yes, I googled this first.
2012-08-11T01:36:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	hmmmm
2012-08-11T01:36:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	I have also checked lsusb, dmesg, fdisk -l. None of those programs are detecting the storage device.
2012-08-11T01:37:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	have you tried putting the card in another computer?
2012-08-11T01:37:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	Yes, I just tried the card in my dell, which is running ubuntu 11. Works fine
2012-08-11T01:38:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	can you auto mount another card?
2012-08-11T01:38:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	or have you tried manually mounting?
2012-08-11T01:39:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	I cant manually mount because it isnt giving it a device name to mount it from
2012-08-11T01:39:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	try another card in same computer
2012-08-11T01:41:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	I just tried another sd card in this computer, I checked fdisk, lsusb and dmesg. Its still not providing  a device name for this device.
2012-08-11T01:41:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	I think this may be a potential issue with this release
2012-08-11T01:41:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	then i would say one of two things
2012-08-11T01:41:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	ubuntu is messed up or something happened to the reader
2012-08-11T01:42:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	since im a hardware person im blaming software :-P
2012-08-11T01:43:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	hahah.. I agree. I'm leaning to the fact that its a software issue..
2012-08-11T01:43:00.000Z	danielboston26	hollenjf	i don't have a install of 12.04 to test
2012-08-11T01:59:00.000Z	hollenjf	danielboston26	I've solved my problem.. It was a hardware failure.. the UBS port that the sd card reader was plugged into went dead.. I moved it to a new usb port and Wala!
