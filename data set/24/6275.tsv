2005-12-11T10:29:00.000Z	Muldy		where would i go to request new things for the next ubuntu releaes
2005-12-11T10:31:00.000Z	Muldy		1.5 has memory leaks in it, and so does 1.0
2005-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	Muldy		mozilla need to majorly overhaul fiefox
2005-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	Not memory leaks, bad malloc
2005-12-11T10:32:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	explain bad malloc?
2005-12-11T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	Let's say firefox is using |||||||||| (memory) and frees some of it so it's only using ||0000000| (0 is non-used). The free parts count against firefox until that last used part is freed.
2005-12-11T10:34:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	see, i think it goes beyodn that, because i've noticed that the memory keeps growing and growing. if what you were saying were true, the next time someone someone malloc'd, some of those 0's would be allocated i assume? but no, firefox just asks for more ram.
2005-12-11T10:39:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	but it doesnt reuse it it allocates more.
2005-12-11T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	No, no one else can use them until firefox gives up that last |
2005-12-11T10:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	But yeah, firefox does eat a lot of RAM holding the cache entirely in ram.
2005-12-11T10:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	But firefox does hold the entire cache in RAM.
2005-12-11T10:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	So if you have broadband and bandwidth to spare kill the cache.
2005-12-11T10:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	Yeah, it doesn't like to free RAM but it doesn't use more, it'll reuse that 130mb.
2005-12-11T10:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	To be honest most linux apps like to eat up all the ram they can, it's just the way it is.
2005-12-11T10:40:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	yeah but this is just ridiculous
2005-12-11T10:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	For firefox 2.0 gecko is basically getting rewritten so hopefully this will get cleaned up.
2005-12-11T10:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	They're getting rid of a _lot_ of dead code and switching to cairo for all rendering.
2005-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	dead == unmaintained
2005-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	i hope so, cause apart from this, 1.5 is pretty decent.
2005-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	The architectural reorganization plan is an awesome read.
2005-12-11T10:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	But it's spread out along about 5 different blog posts.
2005-12-11T10:42:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	hmmm okay. dont they have a concise roadmap somewhere/
2005-12-11T10:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	Muldy	Not that I know of, but it might have been migrated to the wiki.
2005-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	Muldy	Amaranth	ah ok. cause i know they did have a roadmap website but it was very vague. not nearly as comprehensive as openoffice's one
