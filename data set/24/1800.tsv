2009-09-17T15:32:00.000Z	UBestB		Terry yes, but didn't know it ran on nix
2009-09-17T15:33:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	i just want to know that if i had created image of c drive from norton ghost, can i use that image on different hdd?
2009-09-17T15:34:00.000Z	UBestB	Terry	usually you can but it's confined to the size of C drive, you can't be less
2009-09-17T15:35:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	yes i know, before my c drive has total 15gb, in new hdd it has 20 gb, is that ok?
2009-09-17T15:36:00.000Z	UBestB		yes, but C drive will stay 15GB, it doesn't increase, you'd need a partition editor to increase it
2009-09-17T15:36:00.000Z	UBestB	Terry	don't quote me on that though, maybe Ghost has changed since I used it... and that was years ago
2009-09-17T15:37:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	thats ok, you mean i have image of windows xp(15gb c drive), and i can just restore that windows xp on different hdd which is also 15gb c drive, right?
2009-09-17T15:38:00.000Z	Terry		thanx

2009-09-17T15:38:00.000Z	UBestB		yea, as long as it fits... but even in larger drives... it still only creates a partition of 15gb, so you'll need to resize it to fill the other drive if that's what you need
2009-09-17T15:39:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	it means i don;t have to install windows xp again on new hdd, just have to do some changes like drivers n softwares?

2009-09-17T15:40:00.000Z	UBestB	Terry	moving it to a new computer or the same?
2009-09-17T15:40:00.000Z	Terry		difference?
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	UBestB		well, if it's a new computer, it'll have new hardware... which XP should be fine with detecting and fixing driver issues... hopefully
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	in same computer its very easy, i think?
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	UBestB		same computer no changes are necessary, just Windows will detect the larger drive and fix that
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	and in vista it is complicated or easy like xp
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	and in vista it is complicated or easy like xp?
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	UBestB		should be the same
2009-09-17T15:43:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	is there any software like ghost in ubuntu, for making drive image and use it later?
2009-09-17T15:45:00.000Z	Terry	UBestB	i have usb startup usb drive, can i add password on that?
