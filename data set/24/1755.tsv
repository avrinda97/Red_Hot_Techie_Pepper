2010-09-22T20:02:00.000Z	Vaevictus		what's the procedure for installing a more up-to-date version of a package than is in stable?
2010-09-22T20:03:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	it's often best to rebuild from source
2010-09-22T20:03:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	get the source deb from sid and rebuild it
2010-09-22T20:04:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	looks old as dirt in sid too
2010-09-22T20:05:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	so get the source code, and make your own deb
2010-09-22T20:05:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	using the existing one as a template. then submit it to sid.
2010-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	i may. :|
2010-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	and then repackage the whole thing, then try and install it ?
2010-09-22T20:37:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	how do i use an existing deb as a template?
2010-09-22T20:37:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	copy the debian directory, and fix it.
2010-09-22T20:38:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	gah, there's a *LOT* in there :(
2010-09-22T20:38:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	i've edited for other non-deb distros before ... seems like i'm doing a lot for a simple version bump
2010-09-22T20:39:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	i have done plenty for non-deb distros too. it is not more work.
2010-09-22T20:39:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	i'm sure i'm misunderstanding something
2010-09-22T20:39:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	and remember that if it was a simple version bump, and the software didn't change, then they likely would not have bumped the version :)
2010-09-22T20:39:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	in gentoo a version bump is just a copy of a file :D
2010-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	NO.
2010-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	and how would i know that?
2010-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	only if the package didn't change appreciably
2010-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	if the package substantially changes structure, it isn't just copying a file.
2010-09-22T20:40:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	of course. i'm saying "if it didn't" ... :D  but anyway... so ... i've got the source extracted and the debian directory visible...
2010-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	Vaevictus	jmalicki	well, i can /try/ a simple version bump easily enough, is all i'm saying
2010-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	if it's truly that simple, you only need to add a line to the changelog file
2010-09-22T20:43:00.000Z	jmalicki	Vaevictus	then debuild -b -uc -us
