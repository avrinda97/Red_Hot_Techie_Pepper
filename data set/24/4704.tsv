2008-04-25T17:42:00.000Z	GNUtoo		hello,is there a command in order to purge old kernels?
2008-04-25T17:43:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 remove the packages
2008-04-25T17:43:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	but i have to remove the kernels,its headers,its restricted modules etc...
2008-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 yeah...just make sure you select the OLD packages and not the current....each will have a meta package that will remove the headers and stuff iirc...
2008-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	ok thanks
2008-04-25T18:12:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	it didn't remove my linux-headers...
2008-04-25T18:13:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 what package did you end up removing?
2008-04-25T18:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 have you tried envyng?  its in the universal repos
2008-04-25T18:22:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	the problem is that at a kernel update it will break the module and the laptop won't have graphics ....and that is VERY problematic
2008-04-25T18:22:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 with envy or just when you install manually?
2008-04-25T18:24:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	before the update i had envy and now i want to install it the ubuntu way so it doesn't break during the kernel updates
2008-04-25T18:24:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 ahh...I think Alberto fixed that with EnvyNG...
2008-04-25T18:25:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 may want to check with him in the forums though....Envy has been flawless for me with ATI in the past and so far with NG and nVidia it's been ok...but no kernel updates yet... ;)
2008-04-25T18:26:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	the problem is that i must finish the upgrade as soon as possible...so i don't know how long it'll take before having a response in the forums...
2008-04-25T18:28:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 I'm not sure how installing the drivers manually is going to help though...no matter what when you install a new kernel you need to create the modules for it...Envy does it for you while the "Ubuntu" way (which isn't cause Ubuntu Way means no proprietary software) you have to do it by hand....
2008-04-25T18:29:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 I honestly think EnvyNG will fix your upgrade issue though...the app is more closely integrated for Hardy then it was in the past...he worked with Ubuntu devs to make a lot happen...
2008-04-25T18:29:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	what i mean by ubuntu way is trough the restricted hardware gui which install the nvidia module package wich would be updated if the kernel is updated
2008-04-25T18:30:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 yeah I've never had any luck with that... :)
2008-04-25T18:32:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	i know it's possible to install the card without envy because a guy(wich is away) succeeded to install it with the gui in ubuntu
2008-04-25T18:43:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 I was thinking of checking the FAQ for the answer... :)
2008-04-25T18:43:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	ok and thanks a lot!!!
2008-04-25T18:43:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 make sure you use EnvyNG in hardy though....from the repos.. :)
2008-04-25T18:43:00.000Z	GNUtoo	v0lksman	envyng-gtk
2008-04-25T18:44:00.000Z	v0lksman	GNUtoo	 yep...and envyng-core if it isn't picked up as a dep
