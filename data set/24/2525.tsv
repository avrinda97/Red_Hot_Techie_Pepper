2008-11-20T08:59:00.000Z	Ikyn_		So I downloaded and installed the linux drivers for the ATI card in my laptop. Once I restarted and rebooted, it's having problems, and when I try to start in low-res mode, it never actually gets to the desktop. Is there anyone that can tell me how I reverse the process?
2008-11-20T09:01:00.000Z	Ikyn_		How do I get to the command line before unbuntu GUI boots up?
2008-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	"recovery mode" kernel not failsafe.. :)
2008-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	try and boot into rescue mode
2008-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	done
2008-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	vi or nano, not sure what you are familiar with
2008-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	recovery
2008-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	title  Ubuntu 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-7-generic (recovery mode)
2008-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	you dont have that when you boot up
2008-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	are you familiar with vi or nano?
2008-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	try typing this in
2008-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	now reboot?
2008-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	what did it do?
2008-11-20T09:21:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	overwriting possibly-customized config file
2008-11-20T09:21:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	type this in
2008-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	it didn't do anything
2008-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	try reboot, if that doesn't work, you should be able to remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	back that file up first though
2008-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	cd /etc/X11 ; cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.orig ; rm xorg.conf; reboot
2008-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	Thanks. It's booting up now
2008-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	jlc	Ikyn_	yw, hopefully you get a desktop ;)
2008-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	Ikyn_	jlc	I do not. But I do have different errors at least - (EE) Unable to locate/open config file  -- (EE) open /dev/fb0: no such file or directory
