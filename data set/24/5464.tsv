2006-07-14T06:58:00.000Z	zammit		my ubuntu installation keeps freezing, can anyone help?
2006-07-14T06:59:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	when does it freeze?
2006-07-14T06:59:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	when it loads the main kernel (2nd step in installation progress)
2006-07-14T07:00:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	id did an md5 checksum on my d/l - that was okay, i'm running a memory test right now, but the RAM and HDD are brand new
2006-07-14T07:01:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	can you get to bash in recovery mode?
2006-07-14T07:01:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	i'm afraid i don't understand - in recovery mode? this computer never had ubuntu installed
2006-07-14T07:02:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	push esc when grub has it's three second countdown.
2006-07-14T07:02:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	do you have another computer you can irc from?
2006-07-14T07:02:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	yes
2006-07-14T07:03:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	okay, so try to get to bash first with recovery.
2006-07-14T07:03:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	i'm not on the computer i'm installing ubuntu on =) just fyi - there is no OS on that computer
2006-07-14T07:04:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	ok. First thing I think you should do is get to bash and update everything to newest version, me thinks.
2006-07-14T07:05:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	i'm very new to all of this, define bash? =\
2006-07-14T07:07:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	how do i run recovery? i'm so lost...
2006-07-14T07:09:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	you should have three second countdown at the very beginning of boot. push esc there and grub should show you a menu with recovery option.
2006-07-14T07:12:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	grub is the boot-manager program that then starts ubuntu or other operating systems if you have any.
2006-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	i currently have no operating systems installed, i'm attempting to install ubuntu, but it freezes during the install
2006-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	aa, ok.
2006-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	i'm at a screen that says "boot:" i'm unfamiliar w/ paramters to be entered here
2006-07-14T07:16:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	...after hitting "esc" in the installation menu
2006-07-14T07:17:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	oh, ok. If you are just about to install then forget everything I said.
2006-07-14T07:17:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	so I take it you have the text-mode install cd?
2006-07-14T07:19:00.000Z	zammit	samuli	no i transferred over to text mode
2006-07-14T07:22:00.000Z	samuli	zammit	transferred over? what installation cd do you have?
