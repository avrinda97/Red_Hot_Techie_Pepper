2010-10-22T08:52:00.000Z	glitchd		why wont su work in ubuntu 10.04?
2010-10-22T08:53:00.000Z	glitchd		ok who knows about sudo??
2010-10-22T08:53:00.000Z	glitchd		and how to use it?
2010-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	probably like everyone here. whats the prob
2010-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	i cant get su to work in ubuntu 10.04
2010-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	keeps tellin me its the wrong password
2010-10-22T08:54:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	but it works when i jus do the normal sudo
2010-10-22T08:55:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	dont do that
2010-10-22T08:55:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	well it didnt work anyways
2010-10-22T08:56:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	then what to do about it?
2010-10-22T08:56:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	su is used to take over the root account. you don't need to do that
2010-10-22T08:56:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	but continually typing sudo get irritating..
2010-10-22T08:56:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	su would jus make to process quicker
2010-10-22T08:57:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	if that's the case, you can temporarily access root with sudo su or sudo -i
2010-10-22T08:57:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	ok, btw what does sudo -i di?
2010-10-22T08:57:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	it's similar, one uses the local info, one uses roots info
2010-10-22T08:58:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	any clue on why su doesnt work anymore?
2010-10-22T08:58:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	will sudo su do the same as su used to do?
2010-10-22T08:59:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	yeah pretty much
2010-10-22T08:59:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	any clue why they took su out?
2010-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	su hasn't been available as long as I've used ubuntu unless you had something special set up
2010-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	what do u mean uses local info?
2010-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	glitchd	fluff-laptop	ok thx for the help/info
2010-10-22T09:01:00.000Z	fluff-laptop	glitchd	sorry, I couldnt think of hte work. local info = environment
