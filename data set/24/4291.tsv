2010-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	tpl2000		I'm a newb.
2010-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	tpl2000		What can I say?
2010-07-27T07:20:00.000Z	tpl2000		Ahhh, yes...Xchat, the closest I'll get to MIRC on Linux
2010-07-27T07:20:00.000Z	tpl2000		Xchat is essentially the same thing, just a different color scheme
2010-07-27T07:21:00.000Z	tpl2000		And running it through wine would be pointless hassle
2010-07-27T07:22:00.000Z	tpl2000		Scripting is honestly something I don't fiddle with
2010-07-27T07:22:00.000Z	tpl2000		So to me, they are essentially the same ^_^
2010-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	tpl2000		(I'm unsure of the meaning of cli.)
2010-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	tpl2000		Gotcha
2010-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	tpl2000		I actually tried running it from Empathy, too...But that didn't want to work.
2010-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	sorry forgot you were a n00b LOL
2010-07-27T07:22:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	scripting is a little diff in xchat than in mirc
2010-07-27T07:23:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	i actually kinda like weechat but that's a cli prog
2010-07-27T07:26:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	i'm gonna guess that it may not play well, but you can try it by browsing to the executable for WoW
2010-07-27T07:27:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	i've got some parts catalogs, etc on my work computer that i run in wine by doing that. sometimes it works, some times not
2010-07-27T07:31:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	look on the left at the server tree, you should see a query window with the nick of the person/bot that sent the pm
2010-07-27T07:42:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	did you reboot or just restart gdm?
2010-07-27T07:43:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	tip, very few things require a reboot in linux. kernel upgrades and adding hardware are about the list. you can restart your graphical desktop (xserver) from terminal by running sudo service gdm restart
2010-07-27T07:44:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	just so your know
2010-07-27T07:53:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	pokerth is one of my favs LOL
2010-07-27T07:54:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install pokerth
2010-07-27T08:02:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	i used to use ktorrent when i ran KDE all the time. that's a nice one
2010-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	you download the .torrent file, and open it with the torrent client to download the actual file. say you want ubuntu-i386.iso, you'd download ubuntu-i386.iso.torrent and use that to get the .iso file from people sharing the file through torrent clients
2010-07-27T08:09:00.000Z	Mr_Sonoma	tpl2000	you download the .torrent file from the url. then open it with your torrent client.
