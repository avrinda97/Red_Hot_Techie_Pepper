2008-01-20T05:29:00.000Z	chickin		elevator_hazard It works (I can tel by the numlock light) but when the setup for ubuntu starts, it stops. It is a usb keyboard and the computer it used to a keyboard that is made for it, diff. plug :/

2008-01-20T05:30:00.000Z	un_op	chickin	tried enabling usb keyboard in the BIOS?
2008-01-20T05:31:00.000Z	chickin	un_op	w3ell, I would, I just tried that heh :/ the comp is very old (400 megaherts) and it doesn't haver that opt.
2008-01-20T05:31:00.000Z	un_op	chickin	perhaps there's an update for the BIOS available -- have you checked?
2008-01-20T05:32:00.000Z	chickin		I dought it, the computer is maybe... 4 5 years old, I could check but i don't know how to set that up and do that so I don't know... :(

2008-01-20T05:33:00.000Z	un_op	chickin	i'm bad at symbolisms dude

2008-01-20T05:34:00.000Z	chickin	un_op	im just as bad at rememboring to put names before my typings :P
2008-01-20T05:34:00.000Z	un_op	chickin	well, ok, find out your motherboard make and model, go to the vendors site, look for BIOS updates -- if you find one, chances are that instructions on upgrading to the newer release are included in the package
2008-01-20T05:35:00.000Z	chickin	un_op	ah! thank you very much! I will try that!
2008-01-20T05:39:00.000Z	chickin	un_op	well, so far i've got dell, I know. and model number 0006328c-12465-92r-0059
2008-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	un_op	chickin	ok, that's not a model # thats a serial number - the mode is probably something like "dell latitude e240"
2008-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	chickin	un_op	oh that!
