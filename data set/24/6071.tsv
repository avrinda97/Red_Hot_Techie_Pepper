2006-03-04T08:36:00.000Z	Ng	babo	you don't have to be a fan, their policy is quite clear
2006-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	babo	Ng	you can't imagine how much fun I've had everytime I hit one of these 'bumps' in the system architecture ... I'm on AMD64 as well which makes things even more exciting
2006-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	Ng	babo	I run an amd64 box and apart from some 32bit things not working it's fine
2006-03-04T08:42:00.000Z	babo	Ng	well good for you then ... :-)
2006-03-04T08:43:00.000Z	Ng	babo	what are you having problems with?
2006-03-04T08:45:00.000Z	babo	Ng	I guess you could say one issue after the next, after the next ... by the time I get everything to work together and properly ... it's time for an upgrade to dapper or whatever else is around the corner ... I do really like ubuntu though ... it's cool, it's just that when I think of working on my computer - with ubuntu that usually means working on the system itself and not actually getting a whole lot of time to do the things that I get paid for ... but an
2006-03-04T08:46:00.000Z	Ng	babo	do you specifically need the amd64 version? the 386 version will probably be a lot quicker to get going
2006-03-04T08:47:00.000Z	babo	Ng	ya ... but at the end of the day I'm a gluton for punishment I guess ... plus I have a trusty P3 windows laptop just in case the s**t hits the fan ... :-)
2006-03-04T08:48:00.000Z	babo	Ng	thanks for listening to my rant though ... if it wasn't for the general good will of the linux community that post on the forums and on irc like this one, I wouldn't use the linux os anymore
2006-03-04T08:53:00.000Z	Ng	babo	you'll need to compile the nvidia kernel module with gcc-3.4, but can't you use the drivers in ubuntu?
2006-03-04T08:55:00.000Z	babo	Ng	I have geforce6 with the new PCIexpress non-agp motherboard connection. The ubuntu modules are version 1.0.3 whereas this is 1.0.8 or something like that ...
2006-03-04T08:55:00.000Z	babo	Ng	they are putting the new ones in dapper ... but they haven't made their way into breezy yet apparently
2006-03-04T08:56:00.000Z	Ng	babo	ah. doh. they probably won't either
2006-03-04T08:56:00.000Z	babo	Ng	no it's ok, I did the recompile already ... I'm just wondering if thats what caused the failure on boot that I got last time after I'd gone through this same process yesterday
2006-03-04T08:57:00.000Z	Ng	babo	possibly, but nvidia's installer is usually smrt enough to notice that gcc versions don't match
2006-03-04T08:57:00.000Z	babo	Ng	so will I have to export the gcc-3.4 to startx again tomorrow morning ?
2006-03-04T08:58:00.000Z	Ng	babo	no, you'd just need to do that while compiling it. once it's been built and the kernel module loads you ought to be fine
2006-03-04T08:59:00.000Z	babo	Ng	hmmm ... that's what I thought ... but that doesn't explain why I seem to have to run the reinstaller and export the gcc everytime I boot up
2006-03-04T09:03:00.000Z	Ng	babo	no, that's quite quite odd
2006-03-11T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	babo	it'll be in the bash man page
2006-03-11T09:54:00.000Z	Ng	babo	if you call up the bash man page and then type "/^SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS" it'll skip to the right section, then you can do "/^ *read " to find the read command :)
2006-03-11T09:54:00.000Z	babo	Ng	thanks
2006-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	Ng	babo	export DISPLAY=:0.0
2006-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	babo	Ng	now I'm getting ... Xlib: No protocol specified
