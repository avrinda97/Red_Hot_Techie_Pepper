2012-02-07T06:58:00.000Z	tiago		my system doesn't go beyond the grub menu. When running the live-cd any of the options the menu provides me just boots the cd again and takes me back to the menu. Anyone had the same issue/ has a solution?
2012-02-07T06:59:00.000Z	tiago		well it takes me to the menu displayed by the live-cd (try ubuntu, install ubuntu, etc)
2012-02-07T06:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	what GPU do you use?
2012-02-07T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	tried the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-02-07T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2012-02-07T07:04:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	this iso has worked before
2012-02-07T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	did you butn the CD as sowly as possible (assuming you are using a CD)
2012-02-07T07:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	is the ram healthy? there is a memtester on the CD
2012-02-07T07:13:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	every option in the CD just boots back into the menu
2012-02-07T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	not a good sign. I'd rebuurn the CD as sowly as possible again
2012-02-07T07:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	do you see red lines in the bottom right of the screen, like this: http://www.mynetnuke.com/Portals/28/images/Articles/MemtestMNN.jpg
2012-02-07T07:15:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	yep
2012-02-07T07:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	your ram is bad
2012-02-07T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	if you have multiple sticks, remove one with the power OFF and rerun the test, see if you get no rednes, if its still red, put it back in with the power OFF and remove a different one
2012-02-07T07:17:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	it's a laptop
2012-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	stil l has ram. they make the ram easy to access for easy upgrades
2012-02-07T08:15:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	so i removed the first stick and it seemed to do the trick, back to normal, thanks
2012-02-07T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	bad ram will affect al the system as the apps run in ram
2012-02-07T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	its one reason why memtest is on the CD, RAM is stupidly cheap so you can slam another stick in later
2012-02-07T08:18:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	what could cause the ram to get like this? now i'm not sure if it was the ram in itself or the structure it was holding it since a piece below the left clip is broken
2012-02-07T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	age, voltage fluctuations (suden power offs), cheap ram
2012-02-07T08:23:00.000Z	tiago	ActionParsnip	is there a way to deactivate a RAM stick, so that there is no need to remove it?
2012-02-07T08:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	unless your BIOS supports it, no
2012-02-07T08:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tiago	some server motherboards can deactivate CPU and RAM slots so you can swap parts out
