2010-07-03T14:19:00.000Z	cpufreqhelp5		how do i find he correct govener and drivers for my p4...for cpu overclocking??
2010-07-03T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	there isn't such as thing as "cpu" drivers, overclocking is a hardware thing
2010-07-03T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	not beyond it's bounds. as I've said, overclocking is a hardware change, not software
2010-07-03T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	that makes no differece
2010-07-03T14:23:00.000Z	cpufreqhelp5	ikonia	software like cpufreq and powernow d have options to change the cpu freq.. i just need the governer setup
2010-07-03T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	they are not used for overclocking
2010-07-03T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	ok, so we need to step back here. This channel is for ubuntu support issues, overclocking your hardware is nothing to do with ubuntu, so try a better channel dedicated to hardware/overlocking
2010-07-03T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	yes, and we've told you the tools you want to use are not for overclocking,
2010-07-03T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	this will be the last time it's explained. The tools you want to use in ubuntu are not for overclocking.
2010-07-03T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	yes, but the software you want to use is NOT for overclocking
2010-07-03T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	it's normally do through the bios or specific software, which is not within ubuntu
2010-07-03T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	there is no such thing
2010-07-03T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	you're welcome to ubuntu support here, but stop asking for overclocking support, the tools you want to use are not in ubuntu
2010-07-03T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	because (as you've been told) the tools you want are not in ubuntu
2010-07-03T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	correcct
2010-07-03T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	what software documentation ?
2010-07-03T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	please show me the documentation that says it's for overclocking your hardware
2010-07-03T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	show me the documentation that tells me the tools are used for overclocking
2010-07-03T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	no more discussion, show me the documentation that shows me the tools you want to use are for overclocking your cpu
2010-07-03T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	overclocking a video card is different, show me the documentation that says "these tools are used for overclocking"
2010-07-03T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	show me the documentation that says these tools are for overclockng - or stop discussing it
2010-07-03T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	and you've been told, more than once it's not for overclocking, so stop asking
2010-07-03T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	that is your only warning - drop it
2010-07-03T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	cpufreqhelp5	and you've been told "they are not the tools"
