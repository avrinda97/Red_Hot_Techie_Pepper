2006-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	tokenbad		hmm....ok I can write to my slave drive...any one have an idea why...I mounted in fstab like this...: /dev/hdd1   /media/windows   ext3       defaults         0      0
2006-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	tokenbad		can=can't
2006-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	is the drive NTFS or FAT32?
2006-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	neither...I made it ext3
2006-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	oh, I was just wondering why you were mounting it to /media/windows.  if it's ext3, your user doesn't have permission
2006-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	how do I fix that?
2006-09-17T13:42:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	try 'cd /mnt/windows; sudo touch TEST'
2006-09-17T13:42:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	chmod + chown
2006-09-17T13:42:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	sudo chown root:plugdev /mnt/windows
2006-09-17T13:42:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	sudo chmod 775 /mnt/windows; sudo chmod +s /mnt/windows
2006-09-17T13:43:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	ack, replace /mnt with /media there
2006-09-17T13:43:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	should I umount the drive first?
2006-09-17T13:44:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	no, you need to do that with the drive mounted
2006-09-17T13:46:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	trying
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	seems to work...but how do I make it mount on bootup
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	if it's in your fstab, it will do
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	unless you have 'user' in the options
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	so just have it like I showed a few ago?
2006-09-17T13:48:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	yes :)
2006-09-17T13:49:00.000Z	tokenbad	JosefK	 /dev/hdd1   /media/windows   ext3       defaults         0      0
2006-09-17T13:49:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	change the 0 to a 2
2006-09-17T13:49:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	the first 0 that is
2006-09-17T13:49:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	it doesn't need to be brought up with '/'
2006-09-17T13:50:00.000Z	JosefK	tokenbad	np
