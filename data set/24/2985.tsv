2008-06-20T01:14:00.000Z	jawbrey		zcat - cat5 checked and proper lights are on, even blinking most of the time.  I'm not sure about the dhcp or static IP, my knowledge is fairly limited to a windows machine and "repairing the connection".  I can tell you I'm on a cable connection and the ip address is automatic, if that makes sense
2008-06-20T01:15:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	can you ping??
2008-06-20T01:17:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	set your ip on the box to manual,  then try pinging...   http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-desktop-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/

2008-06-20T01:30:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	and what exactly are you trying to do?
2008-06-20T01:30:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	if you are trying to share an internet connection using the network card in your host (the one that will be sharing the connection) you need to find/make a crossover cable
2008-06-20T01:31:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	i made one once, and it was all just a matter of switching two wires
2008-06-20T01:32:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	set yer ip addy to something you arent using... subnet 255.255.255.0 gateway (whatever your gateway on your windows box usually 192.168.1.1)
2008-06-20T01:33:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	as long as it isnt currently in use
2008-06-20T01:33:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	i would use 192.168.1.200
2008-06-20T01:34:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	to get internet working with static... youre also gonna have to figure out your dns servers...
2008-06-20T01:41:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	your just tryin to connect to the internet?

2008-06-20T01:44:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	terminal > ifconfig
2008-06-20T01:47:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	ok.. set yer network adapter to dhcp, then in terminal  do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart and see if it gets an ip address
2008-06-20T01:52:00.000Z	unavailable	jawbrey	ok.. so you either are not seeing the router. or the router isnt giving you an ip
