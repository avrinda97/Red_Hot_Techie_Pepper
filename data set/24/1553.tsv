2010-12-23T00:30:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	current /home is on the drive and partition as /
2010-12-23T00:30:00.000Z	whitman		*same drive
2010-12-23T00:30:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	am I to understand you put your home filesystem in the root "/" disk partition?
2010-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	yes, that's how the installer set it up by default
2010-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	so on same drive but separate partition
2010-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	no, same drive, same partition
2010-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	that sounds like a suboptimal setup to leave as default partitioning
2010-12-23T00:32:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	I didn't choose it that way :)
2010-12-23T00:32:00.000Z	adminewb		no
2010-12-23T00:33:00.000Z	adminewb		so anyway, is your old /home you
2010-12-23T00:33:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	anyway, is the old /home you wanted cleaned up submerged under the new /home setup?
2010-12-23T00:34:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	I've done nothing yet so currently I have /home on the same drive and partition as / but I want to move /home onto a different drive then delete the old /home on the / drive
2010-12-23T00:35:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	ok understood better now
2010-12-23T00:35:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	have you already created your new /home separate partition?
2010-12-23T00:36:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	I have a drive formatted and ready for files but currently it's just mounted under /media/newhome and is empty
2010-12-23T00:36:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	in that case I'd suggest (feel free to disregard) that you move the files rather than copy / delete
2010-12-23T00:37:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	I'm assuming that would break if I'm logged in and using the computer at the same time
2010-12-23T00:37:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	can you do such an operation in root / single user mode?
2010-12-23T00:38:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	possibly, I'll have to look into it, the only other thing I can think of is to boot with a livecd but this computer doesn't have a cd/dvd drive anymore
2010-12-23T00:38:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	you might try the provision in grub for loop mounting an ISO image of your LiveCD to boot from
2010-12-23T00:39:00.000Z	whitman	adminewb	I'll look into it, in no hurry
2010-12-23T00:39:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	but personally I'd just start up in maint mode, using the root shell
2010-12-23T00:41:00.000Z	adminewb	whitman	if you do prefer the copy/delete instead while running multiuser, mounting the new /home will cover up the old one, making cleanup impossible afaik
