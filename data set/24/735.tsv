2011-03-05T12:33:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	lspci to paste.ubuntu.com
2011-03-05T12:34:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	tell us the card please
2011-03-05T12:35:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	how do i find out what card?
2011-03-05T12:35:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	I told you
2011-03-05T12:43:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	you'll have to copy that to your xorg.comf
2011-03-05T12:45:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	doubtful youll get compiz with that card though, #compiz for confirmation
2011-03-05T12:46:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	ok i'll check out that link
2011-03-05T12:51:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	oh yeah just so you know when i first installed 10.10 i had full resolution. somewhere along the line it just changed to 800 x 600
2011-03-05T12:56:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	im checking out the link but i see this is from couple years ago so i'm not sure its gonna work because i hear they since did away with xorg.conf
2011-03-05T12:57:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	you can still paste in your own
2011-03-05T13:04:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	ok i copied and pasted /etc/X11/xorg.conf in terminal and it says 'bash: /etc/X11/xorg.conf: No suck file or directory'
2011-03-05T13:05:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	copied how, what was the exact command you gave
2011-03-05T13:06:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	i copied the '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' command and pasted it in terminal
2011-03-05T13:07:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	pastebin the exact command please
2011-03-05T13:08:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	but that was the exact command
2011-03-05T13:08:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	thats not a command
2011-03-05T13:14:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	sorry i misunderstood, i'll try to figure it out
2011-03-05T13:18:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	i cant figure out this instruction
2011-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   copy the contents of that link then save it and reboot
2011-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	theres no content its empty?
2011-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	bazhang	dtrf4837	nonetheless it will be used
2011-03-05T13:33:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	i dont understand...its empty how do i copy it?
2011-03-05T13:44:00.000Z	dtrf4837	bazhang	ok i did as you said...now i can at least change resolution to 1024 x 768, but its still not the full resolution i had before which was 1680 x 1050?
