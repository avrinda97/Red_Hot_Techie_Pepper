2008-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	gribouille		hi
2008-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	gribouille		does anyone know why fr.archive.ubuntu.com is down ?
2008-05-09T15:19:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	no, there are several mirrors having problems because of the high load
2008-05-09T15:20:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	why not add more servers ?
2008-05-09T15:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	well, don't ask me :)
2008-05-09T15:20:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	whom do I have to ask ?
2008-05-09T15:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	probably sending an email to an approiate mailing list, like ubuntu-devel-discuss or similar would be a proper approach
2008-05-09T15:22:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	I bet someone already did it
2008-05-09T15:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	yes, I read something about us.archive this morning, which is having the same issues
2008-05-09T15:23:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	but for fr.archive.ubuntu.com, it lasts since the release of hardy
2008-05-09T15:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	same for a lot of other mirror groups wordwilde
2008-05-09T15:24:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	it is extremely disappointing for a distro that aims to be used by as many people as possible
2009-06-30T14:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	not on the regular repositories
2009-06-30T14:49:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	where then ?
2009-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	maybe backports, you shouldnot expect newer software versions on an older release
2009-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	are you joking ? hardy is just one year old
2009-06-30T14:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	I am not joking, that software update policy in general is to not update packages after release, except for security or critical patches
2009-06-30T14:52:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	the infamous megafreeze
2009-06-30T14:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	stable release update policy :)
2009-06-30T14:53:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	you won't get many desktop users that way
2009-06-30T14:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	there are some projects which try to serve people needing updated software, officialy you have the backports repoistory, non officially you have the getdeb site
2009-06-30T14:55:00.000Z	gribouille	joaopinto	is the backports repository reliable ?
2009-06-30T14:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	I don't know, I am a getdeb user, not backports :\
2009-06-30T14:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	gribouille	a few members of the team which manages the regular repository
