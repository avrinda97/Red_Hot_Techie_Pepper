2009-08-11T18:55:00.000Z	Acedip		how do i know that the computer has ditected the dvd rom??
2009-08-11T18:56:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	type: eject in the terminal. if it opens, you're a winner
2009-08-11T18:57:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	it does eject, but does that mean its been mounted, coz i dont see any icon of the dvd rom?
2009-08-11T18:58:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	so your drive, works but when you put something in you cant access it?
2009-08-11T18:58:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	yes
2009-08-11T18:58:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	if you go to Places -> computer can you see your drive there?
2009-08-11T18:59:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	no, i cant see it
2009-08-11T19:01:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	hmm, never some across that before. Every drive iv ever owned has just appeared there, as well as friends machines.. if its not being detected i dont know what to do. Perhaps someone else in here can help?
2009-08-11T19:01:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	well how to check which device is my drive?
2009-08-11T19:03:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	is this a new install?
2009-08-11T19:04:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	runnning updates usually fixes things on a new install for me, try that first
2009-08-11T19:05:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	no its not, i installed 9.04 months back, but just got a new dvd rom, the older one had some lense problems
2009-08-11T19:05:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	do you have anything in /media?
2009-08-11T19:08:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	Places->Computer->Filesystem->Media  whats in there?
2009-08-11T19:09:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	there are folders named cdrom0 and cdrom1 but nothing in there
2009-08-11T19:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	there isnt meant to be anything in there, but if they are showing up then your drive is being detected by ubuntu, which is good
2009-08-11T19:21:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	ohk, but then what to do now?
2009-08-11T19:23:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	just had a google session - this might solve your problem: http://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7756715
2009-08-11T19:36:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	there is no dvd rom entry in /etc/fstab
2009-08-11T19:37:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	cdrom entry tho?
2009-08-11T19:38:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	yeah, no such cdrom entry either
2009-08-11T19:38:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	then you will need to create one like in the example on that link i sent you
2009-08-11T19:51:00.000Z	Acedip	b3rz3rk3r	thankyou, adding the line in /etc/fstab did the job
2009-08-11T19:52:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Acedip	np man, you did all the hard work yourself. glad its working.
