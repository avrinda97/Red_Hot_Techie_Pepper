2007-07-19T16:41:00.000Z	Orraj		anyone want to explain drivers to me? I also saw them as independent software that played mediator between the computer and the new hardware, but in linux I don't see a easy install for drivers.
2007-07-19T16:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	the short answer is that all known drivers are already in the kernel, you don't have to install drivers. And the ones that aren't aren't easy to install
2007-07-19T16:43:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	so if it doesn't plug and play....im out of luck
2007-07-19T16:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	not entirely, but in general. What do you need a driver for? (and please don't say winmodem :)
2007-07-19T16:45:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	its for a Ethernet card. and it said the disk had the linux drivers on it but its been out smarting me
2007-07-19T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	what kind of ethernet card? Linux supports a huge number of them
2007-07-19T16:47:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	netgear
2007-07-19T16:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	if you type lspci in a terminal, it'll give you a line about your ethernet card. paste *just that one line* here
2007-07-19T16:49:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	okay might take me a second
2007-07-19T16:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	np, I'll be around for about an hour
2007-07-19T16:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	be back shortly
2007-07-19T16:58:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	need help with some complications....
2007-07-19T05:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	what's that?
2007-07-19T05:01:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	i did the cmd u told me to do and the ethernet info isnt right
2007-07-19T05:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	it's what the card itself reports
2007-07-19T05:02:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	why would a netear card say realtek?
2007-07-19T05:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	probably because that's the chip it uses
2007-07-19T05:03:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	okay makes sense  : ethernet controller: realtek semiconductor CD. Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139 C+
2007-07-19T05:04:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	(rev 10)
2007-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	ok, now type lsmod | grep 8139too  ; you should get back a line or two
2007-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	8139too 27648 0 ( line break ) mii 6528 2 8139cp,8139too
2007-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	Orraj	nickrud	can i ask what we are looking at :D?
2007-07-19T05:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	ok, your ethernet card is recognized, and has loaded the driver: 8139too . So, if you're not getting internet, you have other problems
2007-07-19T05:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Orraj	that lsmod command? it shows all the modules that the kernel has loaded, a lot of those are drivers for hardware you have.
