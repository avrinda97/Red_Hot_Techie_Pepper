2011-05-05T04:28:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		yes Omega dns, now i am trying secondary domain name server
2011-05-05T04:28:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		theres only one field
2011-05-05T04:28:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		the router is pppoe
2011-05-05T04:28:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		Meida port: 09000 web port: 00080
2011-05-05T04:28:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		do i need to allow these before it is able to connect?
2011-05-05T04:30:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		does dsl provide static ip's?
2011-05-05T04:30:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG		or dynamic?
2011-05-05T04:31:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Kinda jumping in in the middle here, but the media port is probably for their software and the web port is for accessing it via a browser. You shouldn't need to do anything to access it if you're on a private LAN.
2011-05-05T04:32:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	DSL can be configured either way. If you're with a big ISP it's probably dynamic unless you're paying for a static
2011-05-05T04:32:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Do you know what private IP on your local network it's getting and if so can you ping it from a computer on the same LAN?
2011-05-05T04:33:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	The Nightowl is configured to connect via PPPOE?
2011-05-05T04:34:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	So you're connecting the Nightowl directly to a bridged DSL modem?
2011-05-05T04:35:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Hmm, is there a monitor attached to the Nightowl and an IR remote you can use to configure it?
2011-05-05T04:36:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG	Kron	yes that is how i am configuring it
2011-05-05T04:36:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	There should be somewhere in the menus where you can find out what IP address you were assigned, assuming the PPPOE login was successful
2011-05-05T04:38:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	I can't think of anything that the Night Owl would do that would require DNS and DNS definitely isn't required to make the PPPOE login work
2011-05-05T04:39:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Is the Night Owl the only device connected to the DSL modem or is it a DSL modem with other devices attached?
2011-05-05T04:40:00.000Z	GiNeeRiNG	Kron	?
2011-05-05T04:40:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	I'm trying to understand how you're connecting. Only one device should be doing the PPPOE login. If you're DSL modem is configured to function as a router as well, it is probably already doing the PPPOE login.
2011-05-05T04:41:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	So there are other devices on the network?
2011-05-05T04:42:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Gotcha. Then you're not connecting it to a bridged DSL model ;)
2011-05-05T04:42:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Ideally it should probably be configured with a static. If you're going to want to allow people to connect to it from the web you're going to have to set up port forwards in the router
2011-05-05T04:44:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	You'll need to assign it an address that doesn't conflict with the range being assigned by DHCP
2011-05-05T04:46:00.000Z	Kron	GiNeeRiNG	Do you know how the private LAN is configured?
