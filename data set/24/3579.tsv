2007-12-20T13:51:00.000Z	Unrealantidote		?
2007-12-20T13:52:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	are you sure that even has wireless?
2007-12-20T13:53:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 yes, this laptop has wireless, i had it working with vista, but, i hate microshaft and all other proprietary companies so i wiped it
2007-12-20T13:53:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	pastebin your lspci
2007-12-20T13:59:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 I am sure it has an updated kernal
2007-12-20T13:54:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	well, according to http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/averatec.html Averatec laptops are pre-WiFi
2007-12-20T13:54:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	so unless you can tell us what wireless chip it uses, nobody caqn help
2007-12-20T13:54:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 I will go into bios and figure it out real quick, brb
2007-12-20T13:55:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	the bios is not likely to say
2007-12-20T13:55:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 ok, websearch then
2007-12-20T13:55:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	good luck
2007-12-20T13:55:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 it is a 3200 sorry
2007-12-20T13:56:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	ah, big difference â˜º
2007-12-20T13:57:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	looks like there's 2 different wireless chipsets used in those models
2007-12-20T13:58:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 hmm, guess i could try one driver and then the other if the first doesnt work
2007-12-20T13:58:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 you have a link to snatch files from?
2007-12-20T13:58:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	for the first, just make sure your kernel is at least 2.6.17
2007-12-20T13:59:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	 it is the latest version of ubuntu....whatever that is
2007-12-20T13:59:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	that's nice. Ubuntu has two "latest" versions, and I don't use either
2007-12-20T13:59:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	I just downloaded it
2007-12-20T14:00:00.000Z	luke-jr	Unrealantidote	the other possibility is rt2x00; didn't find any good sites about it, but apparently Ubuntu supports it
2007-12-20T14:04:00.000Z	Unrealantidote	luke-jr	RT2500 wireless
