2008-05-13T05:52:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		does no scripts only try to block scripts it considers dangerous?
2008-05-13T05:52:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		I installed and things like gmail work fine
2008-05-13T05:54:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		starnestommy: yeah I just looked at the little noscripts icon, its definitely preventing stuff...
2008-05-13T05:56:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		while im here, i tried installing the artwiz fonts but they don't appear in my font options.  Has anyone seen this?
2008-05-13T05:57:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	dpkg -L <artwiz_fonts_package> ... where did it put them?
2008-05-13T05:58:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc
2008-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	That should be fine... try 'sudo update-fonts-dir' and see if they show up.
2008-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	i assume on that dir that i posted earlier?
2008-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	just run it.
2008-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	no arguments necessary.
2008-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	hmm, ok then yes... my bad
2008-05-13T06:01:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	a warning about an absolute path and no other output
2008-05-13T06:02:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	did you use '/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc' expicitely?
2008-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	affirmative
2008-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	Hmm, ok, then lets see if they're showing up... they should be there now....
2008-05-13T06:03:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	If not, log out and back in, and they'll be there I'd bet
2008-05-13T06:04:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	negative, at least from the appearance gnome dealy
2008-05-13T06:05:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	Ill ask my other questions before trying the logout: 1) I have 1.7 ghz machine and it takes ~6 seconds for the gnome file browser to fire up.  Is that normal? 2)  Is it safe to go to HH from GG yet?
2008-05-13T06:05:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	That upgrade will probably fix the slow startup ... I'm not sure how safe it is but there have been many updates already (around 50 or so?)
2008-05-13T06:06:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	50 updates from 7.10 to 8.04?!!??
2008-05-13T06:06:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	nah... since 8.04 was released... from 7.10 -> 8.04 there will be like 500
2008-05-13T06:07:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	only 500 people have upgrade to hardy?  I would have thought 1000x that
2008-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	fde	hvgotcodes	No... that is # of packages upgraded....
2008-05-13T06:08:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	fde	oooohhhhh
