2007-09-15T09:30:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	do glxinfo | grep direct
2007-09-15T09:30:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	and cat xorg.conf | grep fglrx
2007-09-15T09:31:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	paste the output here
2007-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	Bozza	usser	the second line you gave me didnt do anything
2007-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	I see it means you don't have ati's fglrx working
2007-09-16T06:14:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	was that you yesterday?
2007-09-16T06:14:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	bah still struggling
2007-09-16T06:16:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	I do ))
2007-09-16T06:16:00.000Z	Bozza	usser	how did you install your drivers ?
2007-09-16T06:17:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	from ati server
2007-09-16T06:17:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	following the ubuntu binary driver howto
2007-09-16T06:18:00.000Z	Bozza	usser	also . does compiz work for you with the bin driver you installed
2007-09-16T06:19:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	yes it does with xgl, however I don't suggest you use compiz with xgl and ati its way to laggy and crashes every 5 minutes
2007-09-16T06:20:00.000Z	usser	Bozza	get nvidia card or wait for new open source ati drivers which will come out pretty soon I guess
