2007-03-25T10:47:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	i dont know about fawn, i installed it on edgy, scary buggy. hosed my system worse than beryl
2007-03-25T10:47:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	i haven't had any problems with beryl at all..
2007-03-25T10:48:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	i havent had to many problems with beryl either personally, but tons of people had trouble stopping it from screwing x, thats what looking glass did for me :D'
2007-03-25T10:49:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	i also know that they used to have a demo of looking glass so that you can play with it, but it doesnt install anything
2007-03-25T10:53:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	next time research your overpriced hardware before you pay for it :P
2007-03-25T10:54:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	nothing is great in windows.
2007-03-25T10:54:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	i hate you
2007-03-25T10:57:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	what keeps you from using linux for everyday stuff?
2007-03-25T10:58:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	nothing i suppose, its just annoying to have to boot into windows to do my audio work, and, i hate having two speaker sets hooked up
2007-03-25T10:59:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	linux audio studio software not good enough? not a sarcastic question, im looking for solutions in linux too.
2007-03-25T10:59:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	no the software is pretty ok, its onboard sound that isnt ok
2007-03-25T10:59:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	horrible latency and the like
2007-03-25T11:00:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	my onboard doesnt seem to have a problem with latency but i haven't put much of a strain on it
2007-03-25T11:00:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	sound quality isnt bad with onboard, i just lose the useful features, like 24-bit audio, low latency, multiple controlled inputs
2007-03-25T11:00:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	yeah, i do a lot of live recording though, guitar and midi keyboard plugged in, as well as vocals
2007-03-25T11:01:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	me too but always just 1 at a time
2007-03-25T11:02:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	i wouldnt have an issue if i used a hardware controller for say my guitar, running it through a pedal for processing, but, as of late i have been using guitar rig, without the rig, requires a lot of processing
2007-03-25T11:02:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	in reason though, if i were to do some live processing with midi control, with certain effects, it helps alot to have the extra processing of an external card
2007-03-25T11:03:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	thats probly true too.
2007-03-25T11:03:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	anyhow, thanks for the help. I suppose ill live with booting back and forth for now. I still dislike windows for web surfing. in fact, i get pissed at windows after using linux for a while. lol.
2007-03-25T11:04:00.000Z	xprimarysuspectx	vexati0n	one more question. any recommended software packages for audio in ubuntu?
2007-03-25T11:04:00.000Z	vexati0n	xprimarysuspectx	i use Jokosher and MuSE
