2007-12-19T06:49:00.000Z	mario		sonicchao:how do I find the problem
2007-12-19T06:49:00.000Z	mario		sinchchao: yes, before I had vista and never happened something like that
2007-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	mario		sonicchao: when I am using it
2007-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	mario		sonichchao: specially when Im gettin some files from my home network
2007-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	mario		sonicchao: it is pretty weird and unpredictable
2007-12-19T06:51:00.000Z	mario		sonicchao, no, my computer is 3 months old and happens only in ubuntu
2007-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	and SonicChao: I've had similar problems, but they vanished when I disabled compiz effects ...
2007-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	thanks for the advice
2007-12-19T06:53:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	what happened to you?
2007-12-19T06:54:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	no worries, it's not an awesome solution ... but ... System-> Preferences -> Appearance, click on the "Visual Effects" tab, and select "None".
2007-12-19T06:55:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	I had random hard locks where I couldn't do anything, and they appeared to be video related - because they got a whole lot worse when I started using dual screens
2007-12-19T06:56:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	how did you disable compiz, because that's what you did, right?
2007-12-19T06:57:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	As I said earlier  dadehoog: mario: no worries, it's not an awesome solution ... but ... System-> Preferences -> Appearance, click on the "Visual Effects" tab, and select "None".
2007-12-19T06:58:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	i already have none there, but thanks
2007-12-19T06:58:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	and you're still getting hard lock-ups ?
2007-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	sometimes
2007-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	as i said is unpredictable
2007-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	have you installed any restricted-drivers ? eg. nvidia, ati, etc ?
2007-12-19T07:00:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	yes, my wireless
2007-12-19T07:00:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	but that's not the graphic stuff
2007-12-19T07:00:00.000Z	dadehoog	mario	yeah, what is your wireless card/nic ? and what did you have to install ?
2007-12-19T07:01:00.000Z	mario	dadehoog	no i did not install that, is an intel prowireless 3945
