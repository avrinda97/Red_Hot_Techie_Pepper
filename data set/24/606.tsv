2011-05-05T08:44:00.000Z	Jeffsi		anyone know why i may be getting a black screen with a blinking curser when booting from cd?
2011-05-05T08:44:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	your CD burn was bad
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	ill try and burn another one then, brb
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	WAIT!
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	yea?
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	can you get to the menu screen and select "Check Disk for Errors"?
2011-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	i boot up then it says compaq then there is a black screen with the blinking curser
2011-05-05T08:48:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	sound like the CD isn't bootable (bad burn) or your BIOS isn't set up to boot from the CD drive
2011-05-05T08:49:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	i just through it in to my macbook and it says it a blank
2011-05-05T08:50:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	UGH!  Coaster for coffee :(
2011-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	i think these may be bad cds, should i maybe try a dvd?
2011-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	can you try a burn at the slowest speed possible, maybe even 1x if possible?
2011-05-05T08:52:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	that will take forever lol but yea ill try it, i burnt the last 1 in ubuntu desktop
2011-05-05T08:53:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	double check your downloaded ISO, check the MD5 Sum and ensure it isn't a bad download as well.  I love my USB Stick because of this :)
2011-05-05T08:54:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	 do you know of any way to force a usb boot if its not suported, also i downloaded these via torrent so i think they should be good
2011-05-05T08:54:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	yes, there is a way with a floppy or CD boot.  I don't have the info in front of me, a quick Google should find a nice tutorial on it.
2011-05-05T08:57:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	im going to try a dvd quick, if anything ill get a more expensive coaster out of this
2011-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	that's a coaster for the scotch :)
2011-05-05T09:11:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	technology just doesn't want to cooperate tonight, it may be a bit before i finally get this going
2011-05-05T09:13:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	technology is supposed to make life easier... I'm on the fence, still :)
2011-05-05T09:15:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	ok things are looking a bit better, its about to verify the disk
2011-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	Griemak	Jeffsi	Good luck!  Hope this disk does well.
2011-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	alright, now lets try this 1
2011-05-05T09:21:00.000Z	Jeffsi	Griemak	how long would u say it should take for the blinking curser to go away?
