2007-10-06T12:58:00.000Z	ardin	gogeta	i have a 1.2ghz athlon. however, they worked fine on windows with no problems, i dont see why i have this problem on linux. i know its not the video driver or the video codec
2007-10-06T12:58:00.000Z	gogeta		weak
2007-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	gogeta		you can try turning on the post prossing and buffer
2007-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	gogeta		might fix it
2007-10-06T13:00:00.000Z	gogeta		i also enables the dubble buffer and direct rendering
2007-10-06T13:00:00.000Z	gogeta		and change the driver from x11 to xv

2007-10-06T13:03:00.000Z	gogeta	ardin	well changing the video to xv and using direct rendering should help
2007-10-06T13:03:00.000Z	gogeta		you will need to restart mplayer after then try the vid
2007-10-06T13:04:00.000Z	ardin	gogeta	video's always been on xv. its the audio that i'm having problems with. like i said, i never had problems with it on windows. i just need something that changes the settings for ac3 or something
