2010-09-21T08:46:00.000Z	bangfoo	unknown	you may need to blacklist the driver...
2010-09-21T08:47:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	tried it, and many other tricks, from blacklisting ,to recompiling module... no luck !
2010-09-21T08:47:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	b43 loads, but no interface...  not even using alias helped. (maybe I did it wrong?)
2010-09-21T08:47:00.000Z	bangfoo	unknown	what does lspci say?
2010-09-21T08:48:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	 BCM4313 802.11b/g LP-PHY (rev 01)
2010-09-21T08:49:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	 & [14e4:4727] for doble-check
2010-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	bangfoo		so, are you using ndiswrapper?
2010-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	not tried that. guess it will not work for injection
2010-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	wl works pretty fine for usual works, but NOT for monitor/injection
2010-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	bangfoo		yeah, the broadcom chipsets can be a biatch
2010-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	bangfoo	unknown	not to be a tool, but did you google the chipset along with the word ubuntu?
2010-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	I`m doing so since past 5 hours !
2010-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	bangfoo		eeesh
2010-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	I`m not a novice user. but this one is making me scratch my hairs !
2010-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	bangfoo		i meant no harm, sir...
2010-09-21T08:54:00.000Z	bangfoo		yeah?
2010-09-21T08:54:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	I read somewhere that based on chip ver, broadcom decides to load wl or b43 . Is it really the case? or it`s possible to load what wl works with, in b43 ?
2010-09-21T08:54:00.000Z	bangfoo		mbp: are you trying to compile the driver from scratch or somthing?
2010-09-21T08:55:00.000Z	bangfoo	unknown	perhaps there is a way to do some kind of alias, but i have not tried that one...
2010-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	bangfoo		mbp: so you need some function that isnt avaliable in a regular module?
2010-09-21T08:57:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	any trick to change interface type ? wl detects it as ethernet, while correct b43 will detect it az 80211
2010-09-21T08:58:00.000Z	bangfoo		unk: as i said, i havent tried that kind of voodoo before
2010-09-21T09:01:00.000Z	bangfoo		mbp: so, are you doing some kind of ubuntu based stripped down build? the standard module does not work?
2010-09-21T09:01:00.000Z	unknown	bangfoo	guess I`ll not find solution even here... thanks for your comments anyway
