2008-05-03T18:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	hdd or usb key
2008-05-03T19:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	about what-->specify please
2008-05-03T19:04:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	When I asked regarding known issues when installing on a USB drive
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	I have got an external USB enclosure with a SATA drive running within.
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	I intend to install Ubuntu on it
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	I asked then about usb key (pendrive) or hdd (hard disk drive), as both are possible
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	Ah ok.
2008-05-03T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	some of the usb keys (pendrives) are 16GB now ;]
2008-05-03T19:06:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	Of course... No, it is an actual SATA drive within a USB interfaced enclosure
2008-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	But I have XP and Vista already installed on two partitions of an internal IDE drive
2008-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	I am wondering whether attempting to triple boot can work
2008-05-03T19:07:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	is there something I need to pay attention to, while installing?
2008-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	should be allright let me find a link
2008-05-03T19:09:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	Oh great, thanks...
2008-05-03T19:11:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	thank you very much. One last question: I have 4GB of RAM and I am installing Ubuntu on a 160GB drive...
2008-05-03T19:11:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	What should be the size of the swap partition?
2008-05-03T19:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	sounds really nice; come back if you have issues--about 2gb maybe? (for swap)
2008-05-03T19:13:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	I thought the swap partition should be larger than RAM
2008-05-03T19:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	well if you want to give it 8GB (2x ram) that is okay-->I have 6GB and only 2BG ram and never use it
2008-05-10T16:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	sure just remove it
2008-05-10T16:38:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	bazhang	I would like to use compiz with my main account, whereby I do lots of Desktop work, but I would like to create an account where it does not load at all, so that I can run 3d graphics games via wine
2008-05-10T16:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Stormcr0w	best to turn it off then for yourself and turn it on again everytime you need it, or add it to *your* startup session (add commands section)
