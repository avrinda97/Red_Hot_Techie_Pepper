2006-10-07T15:36:00.000Z	pmj		is there a way to edit config files in the console you end up in if mounting the local filesystem fails? After mounting manually I tried to run joe and nano, but they both had dependencies and failed
2006-10-07T15:36:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	"nano THeFile"
2006-10-07T15:37:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	i reccomend booting up a liveCD and doing whatever it is you need from there
2006-10-07T15:37:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	I can't use a liveCD since the motherboard isn't supported and the controller card doesn't see my cdrom
2006-10-07T15:38:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	wow, you're screwed haha (meaning i don't know how to help you)
2006-10-07T15:39:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	does it provide any more descriptive of an error?
2006-10-07T15:40:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	I switched motherboard, and the controllers on it aren't supported by Ubuntu. After connecting it to the controller card the disk switched position, and I figured I needed to edit my grub.lst. I also think that the controller card might not be well supported, or not supported at all out of the box
2006-10-07T15:41:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	so its totally impossible to boot to the point you've gotten to THEN run nano off of the liveCD? i mean, is it you just can't BOOT from the liveCD or you can't actually mount it at all?
2006-10-07T15:42:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	the controller card doesn't detect the dvd drive, and if I connect it to the motherboard, Ubuntu can't see it at all due to no support and that
2006-10-07T15:42:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	WOW
2006-10-07T15:43:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	OH you're running edgy?
2006-10-07T15:43:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	no, Dapper on the old hdd
2006-10-07T15:48:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	so this has nothign to do with grub?
2006-10-07T15:50:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	well if you're at a console, you have to have SOMETHING, it sounds like the kernel IS loaded isnt it?
2006-10-07T15:51:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	well it sounds like the kernel gets loaded at least
2006-10-07T15:51:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	huh....
2006-10-07T15:53:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	isn't it like when you use the install CD. The BIOS launches the installer, which then mounts itself
2006-10-07T15:57:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	thanks for your time. I think my next step should be to get a small linux distro onto an USB stick and edit files that way
2006-10-07T15:57:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	sorry i couldn't help
2006-10-07T15:58:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	may i reccomend damn small linux?
2006-10-07T15:58:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	the tragic thing is that Edgy doesn't support a very common chipset
2006-10-07T15:58:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	well hopefully they'll fix that
2006-10-07T15:58:00.000Z	pmj	Ademan	tons of people are going to fail to install Ubuntu unless they finally fix this
2006-10-07T15:59:00.000Z	Ademan	pmj	ok, good
