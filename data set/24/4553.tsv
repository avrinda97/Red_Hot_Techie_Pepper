2007-03-12T05:04:00.000Z	Vince_		I need help installing.  Both Edgy and Dapper report that they cannot mount the CD-ROM drive during intallation.  I have tried downloading different copies of the ISO's from different mirrors.  The MD5 Sums check out so I doubt the downloads are being corrupted.  I have tried different CD Rom Drives.  I have tried checking the CD-ROM however this results in the same error.  I have tried...
2007-03-12T05:04:00.000Z	Vince_		...switching the CD-ROMS physicly and logicly from Master to Slave and back.  Can somebody please help.  I am at my wits end.
2007-03-12T05:05:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	what do you mean "mounting the cdrom during installation"? If it is installing it is mounted, no?
2007-03-12T05:06:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	I mean just that it loads the CD boots from it, I select Text Mode, it asks a few question then tells me it cannot mount the CD-ROM
2007-03-12T05:07:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	and the graphical installation is the same?
2007-03-12T05:09:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	wow! bad motherboard, hardware, BIOS, architecture, all, everything?
2007-03-12T05:13:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	Is it old? Anyways I would recommend you to try Knoppix Live CD. You can try if that runs.
2007-03-12T05:14:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	I don't want knoppix I want ubuntu
2007-03-12T05:15:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	Knoppix is based on Debian just like Ubuntu; so if Knoppix runs, you may gather information that you may use on Ubuntu, you can even tell developers about it.
2007-03-12T05:16:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	Im not smart enough to even know what i'm looking for.  I know this board works with Ubuntu because i've had it running on this machine before.
2007-03-12T05:18:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	ah, okay. Mmm.. Breezy is old, and you tried the newer versions... You didn't answered how old your motherboard was.
2007-03-12T05:20:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	I guess you are out of luck then... sorry. Yeah. As long as you have time try everything that comes to your mind!
2007-03-12T06:00:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	I was away doing other stuff, so what did I miss? Did you tried Knoppix?
2007-03-12T06:01:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	Yes, Knoppix loads fine except that it dosen't see my wireless card but I need drivers for it and I knew that already
2007-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	Unfortunatly the Ubuntu Install did not want to run from within Knoppix
2007-03-12T06:03:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	You never mentioned which Ubuntu you used before on that machine.
2007-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	Did I loose you?
2007-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	what?
2007-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	YOu asked me what version of Ubuntu I had used previously
2007-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	ah yes.
2007-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	Did you see my answer?
2007-03-12T06:10:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	NO. What? private message?
2007-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	Vince_	vox754	I said I had previously used Breazy, but it was giving me different installation issues.  It just wants to loop when I get to the part about inserting my User ID and Password.
2007-03-12T06:12:00.000Z	vox754	Vince_	ah, yes, I recall. And I told you it was old. So I have no clue. Anyways. I must leave now.
