2009-03-29T16:57:00.000Z	ynk		where am I supposed to install the themes/icons/window borders/etc that I've saved from art.gnome.org?
2009-03-29T16:57:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	in your settings panel
2009-03-29T16:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		guys, what p2p programs work wonders for you in alternative to Frostwire??
2009-03-29T16:59:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	I went to the settings panel and I could not see them. was I not supposed to extract them?
2009-03-29T16:59:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		i use Transmission yet but  i mean an alternative to Frostwire, so a direct connection program
2009-03-29T16:59:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	ok... when you're there, click on appearance
2009-03-29T17:00:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	and you're done
2009-03-29T17:01:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	i'm not sure you understood the nature of my question. i know how to change themes and what not. but installing it is a bit different. for one, i don't even know WHERE i'm supposed to put the themes i saved. lol
2009-03-29T17:02:00.000Z	ynk		i didn't save theme packages. that would probably have been easier. i just have random window borders, random single themes, icons..
2009-03-29T17:02:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	sorry. then, when you're on the appearance box, just drag and drop the file you saved from gnome art
2009-03-29T17:02:00.000Z	ynk		oooh, i see.
2009-03-29T17:02:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	you are the man!
2009-03-29T17:03:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	;)
2009-03-29T17:03:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	oh another thing..
2009-03-29T17:03:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	if something goes wrong with the drag and drop, try changing the format of the folder your themes are compressed in, ok?
2009-03-29T17:04:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	for exemple.. .tar , .tar.bz , .tar.gz
2009-03-29T17:04:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	do you know some alternative program to Frostwire?
2009-03-29T17:04:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	actually i've already taken the liberty of extracting 'em.
2009-03-29T17:04:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	oh ok
2009-03-29T17:04:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	quite honestly i have never heard of frostwire. i use edonkey myself.
2009-03-29T17:05:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	is it quite fast?
2009-03-29T17:05:00.000Z	ynk		it is.
2009-03-29T17:05:00.000Z	ynk	harlemdavvey	definetely is.
2009-03-29T17:05:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	ynk	ok, thank you very much for your help:)
