2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Milktea		the music doesn't play, it's just eaten through extremely fast
2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Milktea		Sound is working
2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Milktea		XMMS just doesn't play music
2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Milktea		It doesn't start the file
2006-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Milktea		It's a playlist
2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	snoops	Milktea	can you play stuff in other applications?

2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	snoops	Milktea	have you tried changing the engine xmms uses?
2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	snoops		in options
2006-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	Milktea		oh I'll check

2006-07-01T14:12:00.000Z	Milktea	snoops	I changed them but it still doesn't work
2006-07-01T14:12:00.000Z	Milktea		I don't think it's a problem with output
2006-07-01T14:13:00.000Z	Milktea		It goes through my playlist like a batch file
2006-07-01T14:13:00.000Z	Milktea		:[
2006-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	snoops		hatred xgl isn't eyecandy. It's an open gl rendered server layer.. compiz is the composating manager which has plugins with some eyecandy, as well as big usabily improvements
2006-07-01T14:15:00.000Z	snoops	Milktea	I'm wondering if it's a problem with file locations.. can you drag one of the songs in directly to see?
