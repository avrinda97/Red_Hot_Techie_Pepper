2011-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		Got a stupid ?... Is it typical that a persistent distro would crash if u use a 2nd usb for storage
2011-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	wirefrozen1	a usb loaded with a persistent casper-tw?
2011-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	urlin2u		casoer-rw
2011-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		yes.
2011-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		casper
2011-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	wirefrozen1	that casper fills up and is difficult to clean if you update to much it can crash it is just running off the iso.
2011-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		how do i talk at you urlin
2011-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	wirefrozen1	type part if my nbic then hit the tab.
2011-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	urlin2u		nic
2011-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	wirefrozen1	urlin2u	nice
2011-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		sorry its been a while
2011-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		i have a 3.1gb partition
2011-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		its the persistent partition of a cruzer usb disk
2011-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		it is INACCESSIBLE.
2011-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	wirefrozen1	exactly, if you have a larger usb you can make a casper partition and have it be larger.
2011-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		good for a bigger usb?
2011-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	wirefrozen1	urlin2u	the one i have is 16
2011-12-28T11:33:00.000Z	wirefrozen1		Unetbootin would not create a larger partition that would boot persistent
