2005-10-23T09:55:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	please don't paste things in here
2005-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	it grealtly depends on what you want to do with it
2005-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	if you're using it to dowload other people's software, you don't need to setup anything
2005-11-17T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	if you're running your own repository, that is more work
2005-11-17T13:12:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	how does it work
2005-11-17T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	what ar you planning to do with it?
2005-11-17T13:13:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	install a game :P
2005-11-17T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	then install the 'cvs' package however you normally install [aclages
2005-11-17T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	have you ever installed anything on ubuntu before?
2005-11-17T13:15:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	yeah of course
2005-11-17T13:15:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	source files never seem to work for me though
2005-11-17T13:16:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	and how did you install them?
2005-11-17T13:16:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	if the config didnt work, like some kind of c++ compiler error or something, then i just gave up, because it seems i can never get all the dependencies to get it to work anyways
2005-11-17T13:17:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	ok...
2005-11-17T13:17:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	anyway, install the cvs package like you installed the others, and you'll have the 'cvs' command.
2005-11-17T13:19:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	so i apt-got ( :P ) cvs, and then ran the cvs terminal line that the site gave me, now? where is it? :P hahaha
2005-11-17T13:19:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	yes, and it will be in the directory you run it in
2005-11-17T13:21:00.000Z	Zealot87	bob2	ok it created a dir on my filesystem, but i dont understand, how do i run the app now? :P
2005-11-17T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	Zealot87	you read the instructions very very carefully
