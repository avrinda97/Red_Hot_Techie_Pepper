2011-10-20T14:12:00.000Z	BoomerBile		i can ssh to my machine but rsync isn't working... any reasons i could be having this problem?
2011-10-20T14:12:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	is rsync installed?
2011-10-20T14:12:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	yes
2011-10-20T14:13:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	also what is the command you use to invoke rsync
2011-10-20T14:16:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	my rsync command is a few lines up
2011-10-20T14:17:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	are you using rsync over ssh or rsyncd?
2011-10-20T14:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	cos that command requires that you run rsyncd on the remote.
2011-10-20T14:20:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	here is how i do it rsync -avPe ssh someuser@x.y.z.w:/home/somethingto/backup .
2011-10-20T14:22:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	that's the same thing i'm doing... the only difference is the -P which wouldn't matter...
2011-10-20T14:24:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	where have you asked it to use ssh in that command?
2011-10-20T14:24:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	and if you did you wouldnt need to specify the port (only in 'ssh -p non-standard-port)
2011-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	i told you i tried the --rsh=ssh which is the same as -e ssh
2011-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	and i have to specify a non-standard port because i don't have a daemon listening on a standard one
2011-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	so what errors are you getting?
2011-10-20T14:26:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	my crystal ball is a little fuzzy right now
2011-10-20T14:28:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	which is why you need to specify the port in rsync -e 'ssh -p 1234' and not outside
2011-10-20T14:31:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	you didnt read the Manual first? r
2011-10-20T14:31:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	back in 1995 i read the manual... haven't needed to since then
2011-10-20T14:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	ah good for you;
2011-10-20T14:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	so does it work now like it should?
2011-10-20T14:34:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	you're welcome
2011-10-20T14:35:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	must be because i'm going through a couple firewalls and this free attnet free wifi must be complicating things... and thanks
2011-10-20T15:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	BoomerBile	pastebinit also does it
2011-10-20T15:34:00.000Z	BoomerBile	phlak_user	i'm sure it, and at least 5 other apps probably do it
