2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	can u help me?
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	whats up?
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	i can try
2007-07-05T14:28:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	I cannot change my resolution upper than 1024
2007-07-05T14:29:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	ok, and your monitor supports a higher resolution?
2007-07-05T14:29:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	in Windows, yes.
2007-07-05T14:30:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	ok, possible points of failure (that I can think of) are with the xorg.conf file, the drivers that you have installed, and sometimes the kernel options that are set can interfere
2007-07-05T14:32:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	so, first: paste the sections of your xorg.conf file that are labeled ``screen''. and what vid card do you have?
2007-07-05T14:33:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	the driver are the restricted fglrx (I have an x700), I tried changing xorg.conf replacing all the resolution in 1280x800. But restarting x, it rewrite xorg.conf with the old options and started with 1024x768 resolution.
2007-07-05T14:33:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	paste2.org/new-paste
2007-07-05T14:33:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	try killing X first, and making the edits in the TTY terminal
2007-07-05T14:33:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	I dont know, but xserver might revert to the saved conf file if it crashes
2007-07-05T14:33:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	or save something in cache?
2007-07-05T14:34:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	I don't know at all. Now I paste my xorg.conf
2007-07-05T14:37:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	http://paste2.org/p/4373
2007-07-05T14:37:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	is the monitor configuration, maybe?
2007-07-05T14:38:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	well, one thing first:  its generally a good idea to have multiple resolutions listed, so it can fallback to something else if need be.  second, the screen section looks ok.  it could be something going awry with your video card, though.  I had to get the proprietary nvidia drivers for my gf fx5500.  You might look into that as an issue.
2007-07-05T14:39:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	I am using the fglrx restricted driver for my ATI radeon x700
2007-07-05T14:40:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	I know this doesn't directly apply to the issue you are having, (as the docs are written for gentoo distro) but they might provide some insight into the issues.  http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/nvidia-guide.xml
2007-07-05T14:40:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	does your kernel have all the proper settings for the card?  or are you using a vanilla kernel?
2007-07-05T14:41:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	I just installed ubuntu 7.04 without modifying the default kernel settings
2007-07-05T14:41:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	ok.  you might need to do something with it, under drivers.  but Im not sure really.  read somme of that guide i posted here, and see if it helps.
2007-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	ZmaX	powergoal	ok, thanks a lot.
2007-07-05T14:44:00.000Z	powergoal	ZmaX	you're welcome.  good luck!
