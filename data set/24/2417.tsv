2010-09-06T00:40:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	it will skip the first 3 tests if it doesn't detect java
2010-09-06T00:41:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	I clicked ' begin test ' and now its testing me.. show me data and stuff
2010-09-06T00:41:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	is it doing just a speed test or the others as well?
2010-09-06T00:42:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	well the other tests below are greyed out.. I know my jaav is fine because I can play pogo :)
2010-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	does it say java not detected?
2010-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	no.
2010-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	its using flash to display the page tho
2010-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	any other pages work with java for you?
2010-09-06T00:44:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	the sun java page says I'm behind a revision but other than that I'm fine
2010-09-06T00:47:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	7.0.508?
2010-09-06T00:47:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	I'm sorry to ask again... so on that site it was greying out the first three tests but it didn't say why?  or did it say java not detected?
2010-09-06T00:48:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	yeah, from the about screen
2010-09-06T00:48:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	I only know of stable, dev/beta, and daily..  I`m 7.0.503 using beta and Slart is 7.0.513 using daily.. something inbetween?
2010-09-06T00:48:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	sorry, I'm on daily
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	ah ok.
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	gbear14275	duffydack	and I agree it is a little too buggy... you said you're on /dev and you like it?
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	the buttons underneath for firewall test etc were not usable.. there were no java errors
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	duffydack	gbear14275	its less frequently updated.. yet still new
