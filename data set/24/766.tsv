2011-01-31T10:23:00.000Z	vikas		QUESTION: I'm unable to hear sound on Ubuntu 10.10.  I guess its coz of sound-drivers,if its so please tell me how to install in it?
2011-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	if you need certain drivers for sound, if they are part of the kernel they should be loaded automatically as part of booting up. I've had trouble with my sound card being muted before. It's probably worth looking at properties in the sound menu and looking at the various sound resources it can control and how they are set
2011-01-31T10:27:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	I have checked everything. I went to SYSTEM>PREFERENCES> SOUNDS. There everything seems to be okk..
2011-01-31T10:30:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	if you right click on the speaker in the panel at the top right of your screen, you can bring up sound preferences (probably the same as what you found in the menu). If you go to the hardware tag you can check for mute and test your speakers
2011-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	There isn't any icon???
2011-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	I'm sorry. Icon for what?
2011-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	the icon for the speakers in top right....
2011-01-31T10:37:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	ok
2011-01-31T10:40:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	I have checked everything. Nothing is mute. I have put sound to highest level in it & now my speakers are also at highest level. still no sound.
2011-01-31T10:40:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	do you know how to bring up and use the command line?
2011-01-31T10:43:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	first go to Applications->Accessories->Terminal
2011-01-31T10:48:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	that should be alsaplay -l      (it is a dash followed immediately by a lower case l
2011-01-31T10:50:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	oh dear. just a second
2011-01-31T10:50:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	okk
2011-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	I'm sorry. My memory isn't so good. Does   aplay -l   give you anything?
2011-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	no buddy, it said alsaplay: command not found.
2011-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	could you try aplay    -l instead?    it should be aplay, not alsaplay.
2011-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	sorry for misleading you with the alsaplay thing.
2011-01-31T10:55:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	did it give you any devices after it said that?
2011-01-31T10:57:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	that tells us that the kernel found your device and a driver for it. There's still the question why don't you hear anything. Please give me another minute.
2011-01-31T10:57:00.000Z	vikas	jsjgruber	ya sure, why not..
2011-01-31T10:59:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	could you try?    aplay     /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Left.wav
2011-01-31T11:03:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	that looks right. You should have heard something from that. I guess I'm out of ideas for now. thauriswulfa2 any ideas for vikas not hearing sound from his speakers?
2011-01-31T11:04:00.000Z	jsjgruber	vikas	great. Sorry I couldn't be more help
