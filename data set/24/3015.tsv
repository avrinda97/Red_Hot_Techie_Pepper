2010-09-28T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	means itsnot a codec issue
2010-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	vlc is no good; Mnemosyne uses mplayer
2010-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	it may be possible to make mnemosyne use vlc or something, but it is distinctly an inferior option to actually solving the problem
2010-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	have you ran the sound troubleshooting script?
2010-09-28T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	mplayer imho is better anyhoo :)
2010-09-28T23:13:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	no. I doubt it would pick up non-error issues
2010-09-28T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	it gives a LOT of information about the sound system and drivers etc
2010-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	give its output using www.pastie.org
2010-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	I don't know what this script is, anyway
2010-09-28T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	that's why I'm getting you it
2010-09-28T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	Loshki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
2010-09-28T23:16:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	I don't see any relevant scripts there
2010-09-28T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	the line starts with: wget

2010-09-28T23:20:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	? didn't I just link you to the output of a successful run?
2010-09-28T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	my browser is slow. My bad. The script was still on the page
2010-09-28T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	diver doesn't match the utilities loaded. If you add this ppa it will give you .23

2010-09-28T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	later alsa may make it friendlier
2010-09-28T23:25:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	hm, is there something I should do afterwards to restart puleasudio?
2010-09-28T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	could be worth a go, sure. Or rebott to be super sure
2010-09-28T23:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	its a weird creature. Lubuntu doesn't have it ;)
2010-09-28T23:27:00.000Z	gwern	ActionParsnip	no, that ppa upgrade doesn't seem to have helped
2010-09-28T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwern	bah, well you have the latest alsa now which should help some
