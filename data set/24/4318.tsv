2007-05-09T11:35:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	what's the last message *before* all that
2007-05-09T11:37:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	is there anything on the screen above the "can't access tty" message?
2007-05-09T11:38:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	are you trying to boot a CD or an installed ubuntu system?
2007-05-09T11:39:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	what version of ubuntu is it?
2007-05-09T11:41:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	it's a problem that sometimes occurs when a system needs a special driver that ubuntu doesn't supply in the default initramfs.
2007-05-09T11:42:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	I don't know what to suggest -- you could try an older version like 6.06, but chances are you'll hit the same problem.
2007-05-09T11:43:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	so at the moment you have an installation on the hard disk, correct?
2007-05-09T11:43:00.000Z	ImMortaL	soundray	:  NO!
2007-05-09T11:44:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	why not do an installation in graphics safe mode then and hope that it works?
2007-05-09T11:45:00.000Z	ImMortaL	soundray	: because it didnt reconginze my main partition. !!!
2007-05-09T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	I think you may have a SATA disk subsystem with incomplete support
2007-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	ImMortaL	you keep repeating this, and you don't respond to attempts at helping you. That's pointless.
2007-05-09T12:09:00.000Z	ImMortaL	soundray	?
2007-05-09T12:12:00.000Z	ImMortaL	soundray	?%$^?$
