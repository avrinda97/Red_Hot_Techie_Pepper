2008-07-11T20:51:00.000Z	jeeves__		can someone tell me how to expand my FS3 partition that my root is in without needing a live CD?  I don't have blank disks, and I can't find the ones I had mailed to me
2008-07-11T20:52:00.000Z	jeeves__		can someone kick irc_admin please?
2008-07-11T20:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	that was what the "!ops" was all about
2008-07-11T20:53:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	ahhh, sorry, I don't use IRC that much.  I'd love to learn how it works, but I can't find a lot of good documentation on it.
2008-07-11T20:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	there's a bot, and commands to the bot are prefixed with an exclamation mark
2008-07-11T20:53:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	do you know how to resize your root partition without needing a live CD?
2008-07-11T20:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	you can /query the bot so if you want to poke it, it doesn't bother other users
2008-07-11T20:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	nope, I've never resized a partition
2008-07-11T20:55:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	ahhh, well, I don't have blank disk (well, I do, but they're dual layer DVDs), and I can't find the ones I had mailed to me.  I saw a "howto" on howtoforge.com, butI didn't know if it was any good
2008-07-11T20:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	boot off a USB stick?
2008-07-11T20:55:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	I'm using a Toshiba laptop.  (ie. the BIOS is as dumb as my mother)
2008-07-11T20:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	that's not a very nice thing to say
2008-07-11T20:59:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	have you ever had a set of disks mailed to you after requesting them on the website?
2008-07-11T21:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	set of disks?
2008-07-11T21:03:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	yes, requesting disk from the ubuntu site
2008-07-11T21:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	never tried
2008-07-11T21:04:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	I requested a server and desktop CD set, and I got stickers included!!!
2008-07-11T21:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	it only takes about 7 minutes to download the ISO for me...
2008-07-11T21:06:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	ahhh, but it looks soooo much better when you can go to a prespective client's place and just drop in a pressed disk!
2008-07-11T21:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jeeves__	true
2008-07-11T21:06:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	and since it comes with stickers, it's easy advertizing
2008-07-11T21:07:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	brb
2008-07-11T22:08:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	yea, I did it!!!
2008-07-11T22:08:00.000Z	jeeves__	gordonjcp	I resized my root partition.  took forever, but it's done
