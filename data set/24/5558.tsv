2007-04-14T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	did you restart firefox?
2007-04-14T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	ok, get rid of that and install 'flashplugin-nonfree', then we can troubleshoot that
2007-04-14T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	if you don't highlight me, I'll miss what you say

2007-04-14T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	ok, pastebin result of:  apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree; ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
2007-04-14T05:35:00.000Z	Sevensins	jrib	where do i paste this
2007-04-14T05:36:00.000Z	Sevensins	jrib	here it is... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15536/
2007-04-14T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	does http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/ confirm flash is not working?
2007-04-14T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	so you have flash, where is it not working?
2007-04-14T05:39:00.000Z	Sevensins	jrib	go ... www.rappers.in/sevensins ...the player opening is just like the one on myspace
2007-04-14T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	it seems to work here
2007-04-14T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	you see the player and can press "play" right?
2007-04-14T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	does badgerbadgerbadger.com play without crashing?
2007-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	wait, is it the same?  it crashes?
2007-04-14T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	does it become not grey after a while?
2007-04-14T05:46:00.000Z	Sevensins	jrib	ur right ...first it turns grey but then comes back...but i dont hear sound
2007-04-14T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	well the grey thing is compiz or beryl
2007-04-14T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	this is a flash bug, try searching around the forums or bugs.ubuntu.com for something similar.  Flash 9 is just supposed to use alsa but I guess there are bugs
2007-04-14T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	do you have anything else using sound before you start firefox?
2007-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	jrib	Sevensins	did you say it three times fast?  Check permissions on ~/.config/autostart/
2007-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	Sevensins	jrib	my mate thx again
