2006-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	you play torcs?
2006-01-17T10:50:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	you should have the totem plugin, but I recommend the mpalyerplug-in
2006-01-17T10:51:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	that will allow me to view videos?  it just keeps showing a puzzle piece and says click to download plugin
2006-01-17T10:51:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	what type of video is it
2006-01-17T10:52:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	I have no idea.
2006-01-17T10:53:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	mplayer plays everything for me.  I would recommend that you try it.  Other than that, some people are using flash to embed videos in their site now too.  So you may want to install that.
2006-01-17T10:53:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	it might be flash, how do I get that?  also, could it be shockwave?  and do you know how I get that?
2006-01-17T10:54:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	unfortunately there is now way to get shockwave on linux
2006-01-17T10:54:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	okay
2006-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	nope, not even sure what it is
2006-01-17T11:09:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	it's a racing game.  I can get it to work right
2006-01-21T17:38:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	no, maybe using wine.  Someone was trying that earlier but having trouble
2006-01-21T17:38:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	get wine from the terminal?
2006-01-21T17:39:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	I'm just telling you that may be a possibility.  There currently is no shockwave for linux
2006-01-21T17:40:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	I know no shockwave for linux but, do I get wine from terminal?
2006-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	lol, that's funny.  you don't by chance know where to get MP3 player drivers do you?
2006-02-23T09:04:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	heh no sorry
2006-02-23T09:05:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	I'm trying to connect via USB, is there a way to just mount it do I actually need a driver?
2006-02-23T09:06:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	my usb key just mounts automatically.  Check 'dmesg| tail' before and after you plug it in
2006-02-23T09:07:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	well I have 2 players (different brands), one works just fine, the other (older one) just says "waiting" on the screen forever
2006-02-23T09:08:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	don't know
2006-02-23T10:42:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	do you realize people here are just volunteers?  yelling doesn't make them more likely to help you
2006-02-23T10:43:00.000Z	alphy	_jason	it's just a little frustrating when people with questions come in after you and get advice immediately.  I know this is a volunteer thing.
2006-02-23T10:44:00.000Z	_jason	alphy	I understand, but you have to also understand that some questions are harder than others and thus easier to answer than others.  Don't feel like you are being ignored
