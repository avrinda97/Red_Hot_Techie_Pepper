2005-09-09T06:28:00.000Z	qt2		does ubuntu support the radeon 9250, it's not listed on the wiki :\
2005-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	qt2		err, might someone help my firend fish7678, he's having so many problems getting his amd64 system stable it's not even funny.
2005-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	qt2		err, it jsut randomly freezes when using various gnome programs
2005-09-09T06:14:00.000Z	qt2		and yet it does. ;)
2005-09-09T06:15:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	fish7678, did you comment the Section "DRI" and Load "glx" portions of the xorg.conf when you installed the xfglrx drivers?
2005-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	cant keep it going long enough to install fglrx.
2005-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	what apokryphos just said... sounds like kernel issues...
2005-09-09T06:22:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	maybe try noapci according to one of those in that link I sent you...
2005-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	whats the difference between noapci and noacpi?
2005-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	ones a typo, the other isnt, lol
2005-09-09T06:26:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	 and i already tried having acpi disabled, no effect
2005-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	chown root:root /etc
2005-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	drwxr-xr-x  107 root root
2005-09-12T15:25:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	that only takes care of /etc, not the subdir's. ;)
2005-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	want my ls -alR /etc ?
2005-09-12T15:30:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	I can give you a ls -alR /etc but you'd have to fix permissions by hand.. dont know how to script it....
2005-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	that'd take... to the end of the century. o.o;
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	think you could do something of that sort for me?
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	I realy wouldnt no how, but I can give you the raw list...
2005-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	oki o>
2005-09-12T15:39:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	thats right
2005-09-12T15:39:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	-Rh might be wise .. doesnt follow simlinks...
2005-09-12T15:40:00.000Z	qt2	Cashel	that'll take care of the owners, but what about permissions?
2005-09-12T15:40:00.000Z	Cashel	qt2	a very good question, and I wish you luck with it :P
