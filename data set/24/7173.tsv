2005-04-06T10:58:00.000Z	dex1		I'm using Warty. Or would be if I could get it installed
2005-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	dex1		Where do I get packages? The guide I'm following [http://www.binonabiso.com/en/Ubuntu-miniRAM-HOWTO.html]  says to "apt get blah" but the PC I'm installing Ubuntu on has no 'net connection at all so that's no help, sadly.
2005-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	You can get into the repository and download them yourself
2005-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	Go to the URL that's in sources.list using a web browser
2005-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	dex1		Ama: Should I use the universe one mentioned in the guide?
2005-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	dex1		amaranth: archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu warty main restricted ? Ok, going there now.
2005-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/
2005-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	dex1		thnx
2005-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	dex1		amaranth: How do I decide between those subdirectories?
2005-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	apt-cache show package-name will tell you which one
2005-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	Amaranth		and what version you'll want to download (warty and hoary are mixed in the pool)
2005-04-06T11:05:00.000Z	dex1		ah ok thanks - I don't need to be connected with that PC to use apt-cache right?
2005-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	dex1		Hmm, apparently I do it returned an error.
2005-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	dex1		amaranth: any ideas? (the to-be ubuntu PC has no modem connection, so I'd need to download on this other PC and burn files to a CD-ROM)
2005-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	Amaranth		you need to be connected
2005-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	dex1		It has no modem connection; I can't connect that PC.
2005-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	You aren't on ubuntu right now?
2005-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	dex1	What's the name of the package?
2005-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	dex1	Amaranth	No, there're two PCs. This nice connected one and the old one (no modem, only 48MB ram etc) to which I installed a custom install
2005-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	dex1		Amar: I'm using http://www.binonabiso.com/en/Ubuntu-miniRAM-HOWTO.html, and am at the postinstall gui section. Those ones
2005-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	dex1		This connected PC doesn't use 'nix
2005-04-06T11:10:00.000Z	dex1		geneo: It's an old PC. This one I'm typing on has a LOT more. ;)
2005-04-06T11:10:00.000Z	dex1		But I can't install Ubuntu on this one. :)
