2005-07-28T14:03:00.000Z	prodigy		I'm trying to get Java to work for Hoary
2005-07-28T14:04:00.000Z	prodigy		can someone help me with this?
2005-07-28T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	what's the problem?
2005-07-28T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	what architecture (x86/ppc/amd64) are you on? (not sure it matters, but...)
2005-07-28T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	java-package is in the 'multiverse' repository -- have you enabled that?
2005-07-28T14:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	read that page
2005-07-28T14:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	right click on trash, choose 'Empty Trash'
2005-07-28T14:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	the trash can is in the bottom right corner of the desktop
2005-07-28T14:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	then you are trying to create a directory somewhere you don't have permission to
2005-07-28T14:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	what have you done so far?
2005-07-28T14:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	stand by, let me load the wiki page
2005-07-28T14:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	you need fakeroot for that
2005-07-28T14:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	the exact command is 'fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-1_5_0-linux-i586.bin'
2005-07-28T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	you typed that exact command?
2005-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	hmm. that looks odd. What does 'pwd' say?
2005-07-28T14:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	can you maybe paste the whole error, with the command, to http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl ?
2005-07-28T14:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	it should work there
2005-07-28T14:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	please paste the full error up on the pastebin
2005-07-28T14:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	point your browser (firefox) to the url
2005-07-28T14:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	then, select the text in the terminal window with the mouse, right click and choose Copy. Then, right click on the text box in the browser, and choose paste
2005-07-28T14:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	prodigy	loading it now
