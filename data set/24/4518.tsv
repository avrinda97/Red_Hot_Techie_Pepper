2007-05-05T06:49:00.000Z	kazol		How do I check if I have Xgl or AIGLX?
2007-05-05T06:50:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	what graphics card are you using?
2007-05-05T06:51:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	nVidia Corporation NV11 [GeForce2 MX/MX 400] 
2007-05-05T06:52:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	are you using the nvidia binary drivers?
2007-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	I'm not sure. How do I check?
2007-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	are you on using feisty?
2007-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	yes.
2007-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	System -> Admin -> Restricted Driver manager
2007-05-05T06:54:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	yes, I see it in the window and it's in use.
2007-05-05T06:54:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	well you can use AIGLX. To turn compiz on just go into System->Preferences->Desktop effects
2007-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	I cannot use desktop effects since the title bars of windows will disappear.
2007-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	you tried?
2007-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	I tried enabling desktop effects, but the title bars dissapeared, so I could not move the windows around. Other than that, it worked.
2007-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	oh well ask in #ubuntu-effects for help witht that
2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	is there an alternative?
2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	well you could try beryl
2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	other people have said they had stability problems.
2007-05-05T06:58:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	how about compiz?
2007-05-05T06:58:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	?
2007-05-05T06:59:00.000Z	kazol	mc44	It's some effects program that others have talked about that works in Feisty.
2007-05-05T06:59:00.000Z	mc44	kazol	yes I know, Desktop effects *is* compiz
