2006-10-14T15:28:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	add the System Monitor applet to the GNOME panel
2006-10-14T15:28:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	you get real-time information, and if you click it, there's the taskbar.
2006-10-18T16:21:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	the binary drivers are included in Restricted
2006-10-18T16:22:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	and using "nvidia" instead of "nv" is an "it's your funeral" type of thing
2006-10-18T16:22:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	Is there a way to check which one I have installed?
2006-10-18T16:24:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	which is installed, or which you are using?
2006-10-18T16:24:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	I don't know which one automatix2 installed for me.
2006-10-18T16:25:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	use Synaptic to check
2006-10-18T16:25:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	it's the first time I've used it.  I usually use apt-get
2006-10-18T16:27:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	apt-cache search installed nvidia
2006-10-18T16:28:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	gives me nothing

2006-10-18T05:09:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	is there a way to uninstall it?
2006-10-18T05:09:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	just chnage "nvidia" to "nv" on that line and reboot
2006-10-18T05:10:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	it's as simple as that?  but wouldn't that just be changing the name and not the actual installed drivers?
2006-10-18T05:10:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	the vulnerability exists in running the driver. not having it installed.
2006-10-18T05:16:00.000Z	mnepton	wrabbit^	interrupting an update is a very dicey proposition
2006-10-18T05:16:00.000Z	wrabbit^	mnepton	then I'm screwed until it's done
