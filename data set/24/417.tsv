2011-09-22T22:51:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	no. the user installs Kubuntu - grub boots it
2011-09-22T22:51:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	yeah, I've been having trouble installing Kubuntu. Booting it isn't the problem. Yet.
2011-09-22T22:52:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	then why are you worrying about grub?
2011-09-22T22:52:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	I was just asking what it was
2011-09-22T22:52:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	you can use the live CD to install it to your hard drive
2011-09-22T22:53:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	If I have an EXT3 partition of 65 GB set apart for all Linux-related stuff, do I need to do anything else before I run the liveCD again?
2011-09-22T22:54:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	requirements are outlined here, with a lot of other useful information regarding the install process: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
2011-09-22T22:55:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	I've seen those. I was asking more about actions to be taken
2011-09-22T22:56:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	if you've read it then why are you asking what is required? it's clearly outlined here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements#Ubuntu_Desktop_Edition
2011-09-22T22:56:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	or do you want me to type what's on that page for you?
2011-09-22T22:57:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	...look, I've read tons of pages. It's all a bunch of mess to me. Some people don't learn how things work through the same kind of teaching media as others
2011-09-22T22:57:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	you're asking about requirements; those are the requirements. it couldn't be any simpler
2011-09-22T22:58:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	I never once asked for hardware requirements here. I said I was having problems with installation. I definitely meet hardware requirements
2011-09-22T22:59:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	you asked about requirements before booting the live CD
2011-09-22T22:59:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	I asked about what I should do, not about what I need
2011-09-22T22:59:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	sorry if I miscommunicated
2011-09-22T23:02:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	dude, I read all this stuff. It's confusing. People can explain things in person way better than any paper can. Trust me, I am an excellent teacher
2011-09-22T23:03:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	asking us to explain something that's already explained is lazy. read it, and ask specific questions on what you're unsure on
2011-09-22T23:03:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	also, this only explains creating a liveUSB with Linux, and says explicitly that you need Linux to create a liveUSB. That's bullcrap
2011-09-22T23:04:00.000Z	io	MTPrower	please watch your language
2011-09-22T23:04:00.000Z	MTPrower	io	if you get offended at "bullcrap", then that's your fault. How it could possibly harm anyone is just beyond me
