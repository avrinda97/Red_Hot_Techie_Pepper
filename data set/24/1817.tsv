2009-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	jp_morgan		anybody think google's OS will obsolete Ubuntu?
2009-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	jp_morgan		why?
2009-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	jp_morgan		because google is known for awesome user friendliness, not that ubuntu isn't pretty good
2009-08-08T14:51:00.000Z	jp_morgan		plus they have clout; they can get hardware vendors to create drivers
