2006-11-05T17:28:00.000Z	phenex		ok... it seems like apt is actually fine... i think the problem is with my root user o.o
2006-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	phenex		NOTHING runs using sudo
2006-11-05T17:30:00.000Z	phenex		no root? :|
2006-11-05T17:31:00.000Z	phenex		the only, accept root ofcourse
2006-11-05T17:32:00.000Z	phenex		can't su
2006-11-05T17:32:00.000Z	phenex		su: Authentication failure
2006-11-05T17:34:00.000Z	phenex		hmm... i've added myself to admin group or something like that via "users and groups" and apt-get works now...
2006-11-05T17:34:00.000Z	phenex		looks like my groups were just messed up...
2006-11-05T17:15:00.000Z	phenex		i've installed audacity, and it won't record anything... the playback is set to /dev/dsp, and i think it should be /dev/snd, but there is no way to change it... any idea what to do?
2006-11-05T17:16:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	execute it with sudo first time then set it's input/output devices
2006-11-05T17:16:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	no way to set it under sudo either
2006-11-05T17:17:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	there's a package I think you may need, perhaps it's aoss
2006-11-05T17:23:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	aoss didn't help... audacity still won't record
2006-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	do you have the correct device selected for recording in your mixer?
2006-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	where in my mixer? :P
2006-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	double click the volume control icon
2006-11-05T17:25:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	ok... now what?
2006-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	depends on your sound-card, also, I use a different mixer than standard, can't reference easily, but select the recording device, and I suggest exploring a little :)
2006-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	 it's set to alsa, and microphone capture is enabled...
2006-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	does Sound Recorder work properly?
2006-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	nope... doesn't record either
2006-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	there may be a microphone boost option somewhere in your mixer settings
2006-11-05T17:30:00.000Z	phenex	anto9us	still doesn't record... i hear the mic in my headphones, but when i record it has no sound...
2006-11-05T17:32:00.000Z	anto9us	phenex	some setups can be a bit temperamental, I use gnome-alsamixer, you may get better success using that to set things
