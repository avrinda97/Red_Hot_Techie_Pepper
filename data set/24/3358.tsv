2008-02-13T10:18:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	I saw one the other day.. and i also think knoppix live boot CD has some good tools on it
2008-02-13T10:18:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	is the system just not booting it, not finding the parition or what
2008-02-13T10:20:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	Yeah but did you install only to the partition you made for it or did you select guided use entire disk?
2008-02-13T10:22:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	Im guessing you installed over your windows partition
2008-02-13T10:22:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	in that case, your lucky that windows is so bloated, you may be able to recover some of your files
2008-02-13T10:23:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	You should have backed the data up on your shiny new drive before you went ahead with the install
2008-02-13T10:23:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	I suggest getting a recovery disk somewhere very soon
2008-02-13T10:23:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	And do not install anything else until you get your files recovered as much as you can
2008-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	xinx	badkitty	recovery disk ?
2008-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	It is a great OS, I finally got rid of my dual boot system, and soley use ubuntu now
2008-02-13T10:25:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	Yah you should look into some programs that can do recovery.. your files may not be erased, but the 'pointers' to them are missing.Recovery software digs beyond the pointers and extracts the raw files and lets you recover them
2008-02-13T10:27:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	get a program called gmount-iso
2008-02-13T10:28:00.000Z	badkitty	xinx	You can do it from command line, but gmount is also a good program to use from graphical interface
