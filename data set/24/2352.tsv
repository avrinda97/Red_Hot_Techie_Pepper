2009-01-17T18:04:00.000Z	bthompson		anybody have any idea how to make amarok your default music player.....i tried to go system and preferred application and putting in the command line but it still opens totem..
2009-01-17T18:05:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	right-click on your media file and click 'Open with other app'. Then make default
2009-01-17T18:08:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	it didn't ask me to make it default..
2009-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	when u right-click to open with a different app, there's a checkbox at the bottom left that says 'Make default'
2009-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	i don't see that option...
2009-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	bottom left of the app-chooser menu
2009-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	which ubuntu?
2009-01-17T18:10:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	8.10
2009-01-17T18:10:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	only option i have is use a custom command..
2009-01-17T18:10:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	and there is a list of applications...i select amarok..and nothing else comes up..
2009-01-17T18:11:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	below that custom command should be 'Use as default for this kind of file'. In 8.04 at least :/
2009-01-17T18:11:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	nope i don't see that option..
2009-01-17T18:11:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	that's weird. hmmm. hang on
2009-01-17T18:11:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	i wonder if it is because im opening from ntfs volume
2009-01-17T18:12:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	?
2009-01-17T18:12:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	well i copied to desktop..and still nothing..
2009-01-17T18:14:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	i'm stumped. no idea why it won't show 'Use as default app' :-(
2009-01-17T18:15:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	i just looked at an install of 8.04 i have on an old machine and it doesn't have the option either...
2009-01-17T18:16:00.000Z	dayo_	bthompson	that's creepy. what desktop are u using on the 8.04?
2009-01-17T18:17:00.000Z	bthompson	dayo_	gnome
