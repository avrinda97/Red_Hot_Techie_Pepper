2005-01-15T16:08:00.000Z	Buzzz		hmm.. how do I get sound from other gnome programs ( such as gaim ) than totem?
2005-01-15T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	configure them to use esd
2005-01-15T16:11:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	ok. but esd won't start since it uses /dev/dsp
2005-01-15T16:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	hmm?
2005-01-15T16:12:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	do sounds work correctly in warty?
2005-01-15T16:12:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	no.. only in xmms and totem.. if I set them to use alsa..
2005-01-15T16:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	what sound chipset do you use?
2005-01-15T16:13:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	emu101k
2005-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	oki.. but I have :)
2005-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	/j #alsa
2005-01-15T16:15:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	ok.. but with alsa it works per application basis.. not with "gnome"
2005-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	what about when you tell everything to use esd by default?
2005-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	esd wont start since there is no /dev/dsp
2005-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	lsmod|grep snd_pcm_oss
2005-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	but /dev/dsp exists
2005-01-15T16:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	also, what does `cat /proc/asound/cards' tell you your sound card is?
2005-01-15T16:19:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	card 0 is usb audio and 1 is my live card..
2005-01-15T16:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	so switch the order
2005-01-15T16:20:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	ok. how? by disconnection my cam?
2005-01-15T16:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	echo "snd-emu10k1" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules && echo "snd-usb-audio" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2005-01-15T16:27:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	now the sounds works. thanks!!. but shouldn't it be possible to tell gnome to use card x instead of card 0?
2005-01-15T16:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	not presently
2005-01-15T16:29:00.000Z	Buzzz	crimsun	ok.. not by changing any config files manually either?
2005-01-15T16:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Buzzz	possibly in /etc/esound/esd.conf
