2010-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	sharat87		... any help with my ethernet?
2010-06-16T11:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	what is the problem, I missed it.
2010-06-16T11:23:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	just installed lucid on Dell inspiron and the eth0 entry does not come up in the nm-applet menu
2010-06-16T11:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	paste the contents of /etc/network/interfaces
2010-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	booting into live cd now.. to see if it works there..
2010-06-16T11:27:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	interfaces file contents http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/v642htD5
2010-06-16T11:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	that's normal - have we done this before?
2010-06-16T11:28:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	yes.. it is a fresh install.. yesterday it was running karmic, on which the ethernet was working just fine..
2010-06-16T11:28:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	that was karmic live..
2010-06-16T11:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	so it worked under karmic, not lucid?
2010-06-16T11:29:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	yep..
2010-06-16T11:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	paste the output of dmesg please, under karmic
2010-06-16T11:30:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	shall I boot into karmic live...?
2010-06-16T11:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	the ethernet adapter doesn't work in karmic live? If so yes please paste it.
2010-06-16T11:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey		I have to admit, 9.10 worked pretty good.
2010-06-16T11:36:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	sorry.. my system crashed.. anyway.. ethernet works on karmic, but not on lucid.. and here is dmesg on the lucid.. http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/hNuDFt3u
2010-06-16T11:36:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	we don't have the karmic's cd at hand right now.. so can't try it out..
2010-06-16T11:41:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	any ideas?
2010-06-16T11:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	yeah, there are some errors starting at line 747, but they are related to the wireless driver.
2010-06-16T11:45:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	yeah.. we have been trying to get the wireless to run at least.. but it seems to need some drivers which we need internet to install :)
2010-06-16T11:46:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	line 624 is where the ethernet driver kicks in...
2010-06-16T11:47:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	so, we have the ethernet driver.. and we see the `Auto eth0` entry in the `Edit Connections` window.. but not in the menu..
2010-06-16T11:48:00.000Z	sharat87	greezmunkey	I am not sure.. but should've it mentioned something about trying to get the IP address for the ethernet or something..?
2010-06-16T11:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	sharat87	I'm looking into thaat now, brb...
