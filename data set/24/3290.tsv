2008-03-21T05:01:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	thats a deal there. i remember  when 100GBs were that much
2008-03-21T05:02:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	if you want to partition them up, i suggest 250GB or 200GB partitions
2008-03-21T05:05:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	i'd just partition them into quarters or 5th's, then selecting the first one for the installation of ubuntu
2008-03-21T05:05:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	8gb sounds good
2008-03-21T05:12:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	depends on if you want EVERY package version
2008-03-21T05:29:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	i'd avoid vista completely.
2008-03-21T05:30:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	windows xp is more compatible with games than vista. i couldn't get Diablo 2 to work right in VIsta
2008-03-21T05:31:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	you could just use VMWare to make virtual machines, so you can avoid partitioning all together. but thats just me. :)
2008-03-21T05:32:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	yes and you can use VMWare to run linux on windows. :)
2008-03-21T05:32:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	Wine has gone a long way.  VMWare would be the way to go. I can boot windows XP like an applications using VMWare
2008-03-21T05:39:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	Cedega is a branch of wine i believe. Overall, you can port support forums on mmorpgs under linux.
2008-03-21T05:40:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	you should be able to run wine and/or vmware under ubuntu and that should give you the edge. mind you, not everything runs smoothly with linux, especially when they aren't designed to run on linux.
2008-03-21T05:44:00.000Z	Cann0n	geektasticgirl	open source is why linux is free, and there are so many distro's
