2011-09-15T05:37:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	 can you tell me the model of your wifi card?
2011-09-15T05:38:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	lets see ifconfig wlan0 shows a BROADCAST MULTICAST?
2011-09-15T05:39:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	 you can look at the output of the lspci commande
2011-09-15T05:41:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	right I was following a tutorial online and running lspci | grep newtwork shows: Broadcom corporation BCM4318 [Airforce one 54g] 802. 11g wireless lan controller (rev 02)
2011-09-15T05:41:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	ok , let me check
2011-09-15T05:42:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	thanks, it looked like it was supported online, so i'm not sure why we're not getting any results.
2011-09-15T05:44:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	have you installed and cut the firmware? (or those is tell you something?)
2011-09-15T05:44:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	hmm? so far i've just installed the ubuntu download via liveusb
2011-09-15T05:46:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	checking now
2011-09-15T05:52:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	right so according to this page the driver is supported, but I still can't seem to pick up any networks - does it need to activated? I think it showed up as disabled, but not sure how to fix that?
2011-09-15T05:53:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	have you installed the b43-fwcutter package?
2011-09-15T05:54:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	oh and also a package name b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer
2011-09-15T05:54:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	...no
2011-09-15T05:54:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	try that
2011-09-15T05:54:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	k i'll try downloading those here and installing via usb
2011-09-15T05:55:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	you don't have a wired access?
2011-09-15T05:55:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	nah no ethernet cords laying around
2011-09-15T05:56:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	it won't work without internet, the packages need to download the firmware on the Internet
2011-09-15T05:57:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	hmm I'll see what I can do  - might have to disconnect here though
2011-09-15T05:57:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	last thing, you need to reboot after the installation
2011-09-15T05:57:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	k thanks
2011-09-15T07:18:00.000Z	the_fool	avoine	hey you still online?
2011-09-15T07:35:00.000Z	avoine	the_fool	It worked?
