2008-11-29T15:01:00.000Z	F3d0rA		it returned sorry no torrents
2008-11-29T15:03:00.000Z	F3d0rA		wait its sais the only benefit to DVD is the extra language packs and thats it?
2008-11-29T15:05:00.000Z	F3d0rA		Does 8.10 support Broadcom Wireless? Particularly the BCM4328?
2008-11-29T15:06:00.000Z	F3d0rA		without using ndsiwrapper?
2008-11-29T15:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	it does, with fwcutter
2008-11-29T15:07:00.000Z	F3d0rA		I kmow you can buy  dell Laptop from Dell with Ubuntu on it so I have to assume if you get a Dell Wireless 1505 card which is the BCM4328 Ubuntu supports it right?
2008-11-29T15:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	the broadcom drivers are pretty notorious in linux
2008-11-29T15:08:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	it's hit or miss as to whether a particular chipset will work *out of the box* on ubuntu
2008-11-29T15:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	but, my memory serves me well on this one, there is the bcm43xx-fwcutter package which can extract firmware drivers from the windows drivers, it's a pain b/c they can't provided the proprietary drivers, you have to *find* them
2008-11-29T15:09:00.000Z	F3d0rA	rdw200169	but don't work in fedora 10.  Only way it worked is using ndiswrapper.  I know fwcutter v0.11 now now avaialble to install the broadcom wireless chipsets but even the latest firmware does not hlp my card
2008-11-29T15:09:00.000Z	F3d0rA		serious?
2008-11-29T15:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	well, then you know more than me
2008-11-29T15:10:00.000Z	F3d0rA	rdw200169	 An that woudl work on any flavor of linux or the three main ones?
2008-11-29T15:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	you mean like kubuntu, xubuntu ubuntu, etc...?
2008-11-29T15:11:00.000Z	F3d0rA		ya as well as mandriva fedora dsl hat e to ask that but they all tend to run the same kernel and desktop
2008-11-29T15:12:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	well, i don't know about mandriva fedora and those, but i do know that the ubuntu based distros *that use ubuntu repositories* will all use the same fwcutter for example
2008-11-29T15:13:00.000Z	F3d0rA		ok will def . Look into it.  Maybe it works on the same principle as ndiswrapper which uses the inf and sys window driver
2008-11-29T15:13:00.000Z	rdw200169	F3d0rA	yeah, it works pretty well, but only is supposed to work on the 43xx series of broadcom chips
