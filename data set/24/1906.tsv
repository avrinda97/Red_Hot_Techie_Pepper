2009-10-11T08:33:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	actually ill just zip it up and put it on some file site if that's ok with you
2009-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	sure
2009-10-11T08:35:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	nickrud: humanity icons (karmic default) in case you havent seen them yet: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Humanity?content=111517
2009-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	the upload site keeps crashing my FF :(
2009-10-11T08:47:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	the only issues i have had with karmic are with the update manager
2009-10-11T08:48:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	fixed now as far as i know
2009-10-11T08:48:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	oops - that was meant for everyone in general
2009-10-11T08:48:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	still working on the eikon upload ...
2009-10-11T08:58:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	eikon url is : http://www.mediafire.com/?tzz2j2jf
2009-10-11T08:58:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	just unzip that file into your ~/.icons/ directory
2009-10-11T08:59:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	is the link correct?
2009-10-11T08:59:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	i hope so, i uploaded to my mediafire account
2009-10-11T09:00:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	mind checking the link you gave me?
2009-10-11T09:01:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	ok - 1 min
2009-10-11T09:01:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	oops - try this: http://www.mediafire.com/?tzz2j2jfqzo
2009-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	it's missing some of the network icons for koala - i havent taken the time to add them - but the rest seems complete
2009-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	who made them?
2009-10-11T09:04:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	i found a link on deviantart.com - not sure why they are not on gnome-look
2009-10-11T09:06:00.000Z	natewiebe13	joebodo	they are nice.. but not complete enough for me to use.. one big thing, is they need to remake the folders, remove the couple KDEish icons
2009-10-11T09:07:00.000Z	joebodo	natewiebe13	there are a few different versions for the folder icons - you can replace them with the version you like
