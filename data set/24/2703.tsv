2010-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	wols		someone jumped the shark there. bigtime
2010-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	agree, oo
2010-03-23T09:28:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	: I just checked, least pastebinit works again on lucid, though  now pasting to pastebin.com
2010-03-23T09:30:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	I tried to go to the paste.ubuntu.com paste harish__ gave the link for and it doesn't show me the paste but wants me to login into launchpad
2010-03-23T09:30:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	no link works. in short: whoever wrote that launchpad part or deh ubuntu pastebin is an idiot
2010-03-23T09:30:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	yy, saw that.. what comes next ? paypal ??
2010-03-23T09:31:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	current pastebinit works by : pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com  /etc/fstab  (o'course no login)
2010-03-23T09:51:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	it's OT, but you can OC with speedstep enabled just fine :)
2010-03-23T09:55:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	if I remember right on my c2d you had to enable it in bios, which made oc impossible
2010-03-23T09:55:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	I run a E2160 @ 3.06 GHz (normally 1.8Ghz) with Speedstep enabled. both Speedstep and OC done in the BIOS
2010-03-23T09:57:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	good to know, not general then, my mobo won't let me
2010-03-23T10:15:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	why did you tell him to install powernowd?
2010-03-23T10:16:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	to make the cpu scale automatically
2010-03-23T10:16:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	and what make you think it didn't?
2010-03-23T10:17:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	do you know what  proc/cpuinfo is?
2010-03-23T10:17:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	: I don't have a clue for now, as he didn't follow and used synaptic, so I have no feedback from trml right now
2010-03-23T10:19:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	: yes, and it's a T2370, but you can go on, if you like
2010-03-23T11:01:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	ipmasq
2010-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	how do you set it to downloading for intel?
2010-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	by using are acoording sources.list and make it not install, but store
2010-03-23T17:00:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	where in your sources.list does it say anything about what arch you download?
2010-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	DasEi	wols	powerpc or intel ?
2010-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	wols	DasEi	any
