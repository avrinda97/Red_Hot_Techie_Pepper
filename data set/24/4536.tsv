2007-08-21T15:28:00.000Z	Dusk_		why does hdparm comes disabled by default on ubuntu???,
2007-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	disabled? or not installed by default?
2007-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	it's disabled
2007-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	either way, it doesn't work fully on SATA drives
2007-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	isn't hdparm just a program to set parameters on drives? it's not a daemon or service, right?
2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	i have ide drive..does it work if i enable it
2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	it's a service for ultra dma
2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	ehh.. are you really sure about that.. you can enable ultra dma using hdparm.. but I don't think you need to have hdparm running for ultra dma to work
2007-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	Slart		!hdparm
2007-08-21T15:32:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	i dunno..i just enabled it
2007-08-21T15:32:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	http://linux.die.net/man/8/hdparm
2007-08-21T15:33:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	you use hdparm to set parameters of hard drives.. you don't enable/disable hdparm.. you can enable/disable dma etc for hard drives..
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	but I'm just being pedantic here.. I don't know why ultra dma isn't enabled by default in ubuntu... and yes you can enable it using hdparm
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	on system>administrator>services there's hdparm and it's disabled..so i thought that my ultra dma is disabled
2007-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	there are other settings too .. check out the manual for hdparm.. look for 32-bit access and dma to start with
2007-08-21T15:35:00.000Z	Dusk_	Slart	thanks for the help
2007-08-21T15:35:00.000Z	Slart	Dusk_	ah..I have that too.. might be some automatic tuning thingy.. well.. read the man page for hdparm.. it will tell you more about it
