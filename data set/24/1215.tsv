2010-05-14T13:03:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	Check this out: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1245536&highlight=invalid+journal+clear%3F
2010-05-14T12:55:00.000Z	PenguinCore	costre	ok, if i manage just to access the few GB from my home folder i can do a clean reinstall, but this is a nforce CH10r raid0 and the p/table seems lost what i can @decode@
2010-05-14T12:58:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	Have you checked the status of the array in "Disc Utility"? When that happened to me, the drives had changed their labels, sdj, sdk, sdl etc
2010-05-14T12:59:00.000Z	PenguinCore	costre	it says unallocated space there.
2010-05-14T13:01:00.000Z	PenguinCore	costre	i just tested "sudo fsck.ext4 /dev/mapper/isq..UbuntuRaid1" and it said :Superblock has an invalid journal (inode 8) Clear?" i answered no and it exited, dunno if that could help fix the hdd
2010-05-14T13:03:00.000Z	PenguinCore	costre	thanks, checking
2010-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	PenguinCore	costre	i can access the drive now, but onlt shows a lost+found folder and thats it..
2010-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	I'm not sure, but it could be owner/user priviliegies
2010-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	It could also be that the data is gone :)
2010-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	Try to reboot?
2010-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	costre	PenguinCore	iirc you were on the livecd?
