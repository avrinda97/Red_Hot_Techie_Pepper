2008-11-20T03:21:00.000Z	raven	balle_	u dont use autoremove, u use remove
2008-11-20T03:21:00.000Z	raven	balle_	sudo apt-get remove compiz emerald
2008-11-20T03:23:00.000Z	balle_	raven	Package compiz is not installed, so not removed
2008-11-20T03:23:00.000Z	raven	balle_	how did u install them
2008-11-20T03:23:00.000Z	balle_	raven	apt-get install
2008-11-20T03:24:00.000Z	raven	balle_	how are they "sticking around"
2008-11-20T03:24:00.000Z	raven	balle_	what exactly do u mean
2008-11-20T03:24:00.000Z	balle_	raven	they are still installed.. i still have the compiz settings manager, and emerald theme manager is still the one choosing my themes..
2008-11-20T03:25:00.000Z	raven	balle_	run "metacity --replace", then run "sudo apt-get remove ccsm"
2008-11-20T03:25:00.000Z	raven	balle_	probably u shud do metacity --replace in a run box, alt+f2
2008-11-20T03:26:00.000Z	raven	balle_	if u already did it do it AGAIN in a run box
2008-11-20T03:28:00.000Z	balle_	raven	did metacity --replace in a runbox: what was the next thing again?
2008-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	balle_	raven	did metacity --replace in a runbox: what was the next thing again?
2008-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	raven	balle_	"sudo apt-get remove ccsm"
2008-11-20T03:30:00.000Z	balle_	raven	thx in a terminal or runbox? term right
2008-11-20T03:30:00.000Z	raven	balle_	if that doesnt work, it might be "compizconfig-settings-manager", not "ccsm"
2008-11-20T03:31:00.000Z	balle_	raven	the long one is working, thx
2008-11-20T03:32:00.000Z	balle_	raven	do you know how i can get the minimized windows back on a toolbar? i accidentally deleted it
2008-11-20T03:33:00.000Z	raven	balle_	this will close all of ur running programs, but to "reset" ur interface so to speak, hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
2008-11-20T03:34:00.000Z	balle_	raven	nope that doesent work i think Natsuki is right on the money actually
2008-11-20T03:35:00.000Z	raven	balle_	no idea wut ur talkin bout.
