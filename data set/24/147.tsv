2012-05-09T02:57:00.000Z	AlphaPinky		How do I add new repositories to Ubuntu Software Center? I am getting an error when I try to download php5. ¨Failed to fetch ¨
2012-05-09T02:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	why are you adding a repository to install php?
2012-05-09T02:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	ok, let's start at the ROOT problem then. what was the first issue you had (ex: need php)
2012-05-09T02:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	how did you try installing mediawiki?
2012-05-09T02:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	software center, apt-get, manual, etc
2012-05-09T03:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	ok, and what *exact* error did you get when trying to do that
2012-05-09T03:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	have you installed any PPA's?
2012-05-09T03:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	PPA = 3rd party repository
2012-05-09T03:02:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	don't do it, I just want to make sure you haven't already (they cause a LOT of problems sometimes)
2012-05-09T03:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	please follow these instructions and let us know if your encounter any errors: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MediaWiki
2012-05-09T03:05:00.000Z	AlphaPinky	DarwinSurvivor	Ill follow instructions. Then Ill report to you soon.
2012-05-09T03:35:00.000Z	AlphaPinky	DarwinSurvivor	you are soo active here =O
2012-05-09T03:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	I have been lately :)
2012-05-09T03:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	I do a lot of ubuntu work (I'm also a brainstorm moderator). I used the irc a lot when I was starting out, so this is my way of paying it back :)
2012-05-09T03:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	did you get mediawiki working?
2012-05-09T03:38:00.000Z	AlphaPinky	DarwinSurvivor	it is still downloading... :(
2012-05-09T03:38:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	ok
2012-05-09T03:40:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	is this a new ubuntu installation?
2012-05-09T03:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	if you don't have much installed already, it may be a good idea to reinstall to undo what-ever the .bin installer did
2012-05-09T03:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	well 12.04 is an LTS release which is good, if you want *super* stable, try the previous LTS (10.04)
2012-05-09T03:44:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	you maen 32 vs 64 bit?
2012-05-09T03:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	oh. I don't know anythong about the cloud version, sorry. But I have used the server version with great success
2012-05-09T05:05:00.000Z	AlphaPinky	DarwinSurvivor	thanks using that guide I could make it work.
2012-05-09T05:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	AlphaPinky	good to hear
