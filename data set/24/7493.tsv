2005-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	andril		has anyone installed MPlayer?
2005-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	andril		or have a link?
2005-04-04T05:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	I installed it - but I recommend xine-ui
2005-04-04T05:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	and look at ubuntuguide.org for a howto on installing win codecs etc

2005-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	you need to set up your synaptic repositories
2005-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	xine-ui is in the universe repository - you need to look at those other links as well
2005-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	i think audacity can do that
2005-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	with the right mp3 support
2005-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	I suggest you also install mpg123

2005-04-04T05:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	don't use dpkg directly, use the GUI and make life easier on yourself
2005-04-04T05:26:00.000Z	andril	thoreauputic	all I have to do is add another repository with Uni/Multi verse
2005-04-04T05:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	yes, add those - but for win32 codecs you need others - all on the wiki page and ubuntuguide.org
2005-04-04T05:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	I had better luck with xine-ui than mplayer - your mileage may vary , as they say :)
2005-04-04T05:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	if you have gstreamer0.8-mad installed , mp3 will play in the music player
2005-04-04T05:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	yes xine will play them too
2005-04-04T05:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	in fact xine will play just about anything with the right codecs
2005-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	there are other mp3 players - beep-media-player for instance or xmms
2005-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	andril	thoreauputic	thanks so much
2005-04-04T05:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	no worries
2005-04-04T05:59:00.000Z	andril	thoreauputic	do you know how to remove a item from the Applications > Sound & Vido menu - RealPlayer?
2005-04-04T06:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	are you on warty?
2005-04-04T06:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	andril	ah, that entry must be a hoary entry - don't know then ( I'm using warty here)
