2007-09-30T10:09:00.000Z	MasterShrek	j45on	if you want pretty desktop effects i would wait for a week or two until 7.10 gets released
2007-09-30T10:10:00.000Z	j45on	MasterShrek	Doesn't the current version of Ubuntu has CompizFusion?
2007-09-30T10:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	j45on	it is installable, but its much easier to do in the new one coming out
2007-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	j45on	MasterShrek	How long did you say it was again?
2007-09-30T10:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	j45on	its sometime in oct, i think i heard the 10th, but im not sure
2007-09-30T10:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	j45on	i think they may be releasing ubuntu for handhelds, but i could be wrong
2007-09-30T10:23:00.000Z	j45on	MasterShrek	Can you confirm?
