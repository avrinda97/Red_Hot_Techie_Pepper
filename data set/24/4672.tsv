2007-02-09T16:02:00.000Z	GeekChick|		Anyone know the solution to the LiveCD freezing during boot process? I'm trying to install on another laptop of mine.
2007-02-09T16:02:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	what's it doing when it freezes?
2007-02-09T16:02:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	showing its pretty orange bar moving back and forth.
2007-02-09T16:03:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	are there any other options at boot? maybe not using the default boot option, but a recovery option? I don't remember what the options are for the boot CD
2007-02-09T16:04:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	i used the default option, i also tried changing the VGA resolution. still freezes.
2007-02-09T16:06:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	have you tried any other live CDs that work on that laptop?
2007-02-09T16:07:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	knoppix boots fine, and lots of other cds boot fine.
2007-02-09T16:07:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	ok, I'm trying to find a screenshot of the initial boot screen for the ubuntu live CD, that way I can see exactly which options you have on boot
2007-02-09T16:08:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	boot livecd / install, boot hard drive, and a couple others
2007-02-09T16:11:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	I'm searching teh forums, trying to see if anyone has the same problems
2007-02-09T16:11:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	when i first got in here i gave a link.
2007-02-09T16:12:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	I'm sorry, I missed that - could you paste it for me again?

2007-02-09T16:13:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	its not my problem exactly. because no blotchy colors, its in perfect color. it just freezes during boot process.
2007-02-09T16:14:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	so I understand that you get to wher you should be able to log in to the desktop, but it halts there?
2007-02-09T16:14:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	 ok, so you're stuck on the screen with the orange bar scrolling across the screen?
2007-02-09T16:14:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	no. it freezes during the ubuntu livecd of the windows "loading bar"
2007-02-09T16:14:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	the bar stops moving. and sits there forever
2007-02-09T16:14:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	ok
2007-02-09T16:15:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	you said you tried disabling "quiet splash" modes? (forgive me if I ask stupid questions - I'm going on too little sleep today)
2007-02-09T16:16:00.000Z	GeekChick|	LycoLoco	no. i havent. i just tried different VGA modes
2007-02-09T16:16:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	ok, check out this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1960025&postcount=4
2007-02-09T16:16:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	try that and see if it gives you any kind of message that would give us clues
2007-02-09T16:17:00.000Z	LycoLoco	GeekChick|	haha, oh no! I'll be around when you get back if you wanna try it
