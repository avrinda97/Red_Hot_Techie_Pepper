2009-11-21T18:30:00.000Z	livingdaylight_		please tell me
2009-11-21T18:32:00.000Z	livingdaylight_		please
2009-11-21T18:33:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	/usr/share/backgrounds
2009-11-21T18:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	dank schoen
2009-11-21T18:57:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	If you want to add any wallpaper, just drag the photo into the GUI to switch wallpaper.
2009-11-21T18:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	but i want to build up my backgrounds folder
2009-11-21T19:00:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	Drag the photo you added into /usr/share/backgrounds into the Appearance Preference under Background. Does that work?
2009-11-21T19:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	why do the added walpapers in /usr/share/backgrounds not show up in the Appearances gui?
2009-11-21T19:02:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	I think that's just the way it's set up. It doesn't scan that particular folder for new wallpaper.
2009-11-21T19:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	so dropping/adding .jpg's to /usr/share/backgrounds doesn't do anything?
2009-11-21T19:03:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	It just adds to that directory, but information regarding the background is stored in an xml file in .gnome2 in your home directory.
2009-11-21T19:05:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	Nope, just drag whatever pictures you want to add to the collection to Appearance > Background. The xml file is automatically updated when you do that.
2009-11-21T19:06:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	Hold on if you want Ubuntu to automatically scan a folder for wallpaper. I am searching on the forum.
2009-11-21T19:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	i wonder whether i can drag 'em from usr/share/backgrounds or whether i'll encounter permmission issues that way. Because as you know if i drag the wallpaper.jpg from Desktop to Appearance>Backround gui it will add it but the moment i delete the original from Desktop it will disappear in the Appearnce
2009-11-21T19:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	ok, i'm dragging the wallpaper.jpg's from usr/share/backgrounds as you suggest into the Appearnces gui and it works
2009-11-21T19:09:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	Yup, I just tried it and it works as well.
2009-11-21T19:10:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	yup that works, so i'm satisfied with that. although ideally, and logically, adding wallpager.jpg's into the usr/share/background folder should show up in Appearnces automatically after a rescan
2009-11-21T19:10:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	I knot what you mean.
2009-11-21T19:11:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	thx for the help
2009-11-21T19:12:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	I would suggest you create a .wallpaper directory in your home folder and use that to build up your wallpaper though. I am not sure but when Ubuntu updates it *might* delete those that you have added. As /usr/share/background is in the root directory, and you aren't really supposed to mess with it.
2009-11-21T19:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	even if i've sudo cp 'd them?
2009-11-21T19:13:00.000Z	khensthoth	livingdaylight_	I really have no idea if Ubuntu will delete it. Most likely it wouldn't.
2009-11-21T19:14:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	khensthoth	don't see why. just as i've added fonts to /usr/share/fonts
