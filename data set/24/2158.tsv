2009-03-25T10:31:00.000Z	quietas	canuck1	bittornado works, I use torrentflux on my server though
2009-03-25T10:32:00.000Z	canuck1	quietas	 I will check out those others
2009-03-25T10:32:00.000Z	quietas	canuck1	I used transmission on the mac and did not like it much, Torrentflus is great as I tell it to download on my home server, then shut my laptop and go to work
2009-03-25T10:35:00.000Z	canuck1	quietas	torrentflux looks neat :)
2009-03-25T10:36:00.000Z	quietas	canuck1	on my home server I run samba fore filesharing, torrentflux for downloading, firefly for itunes sharing, next is something for xbox 360 video sharing
2009-03-25T10:36:00.000Z	canuck1	quietas	a linux based solution for the 360?
2009-03-25T10:38:00.000Z	quietas	canuck1	not quite, stock 360 but to be able to view my video files shared from my linux server as though it were a media center
2009-03-25T10:39:00.000Z	quietas	canuck1	ushare is the tool I've read a bit about for it - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=632428
