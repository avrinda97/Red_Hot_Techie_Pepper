2010-11-27T02:38:00.000Z	digitalstimulus		does anyone know where PiTiVi config settings are located in ~/?
2010-11-27T02:39:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	why are you using pitivi? doesn't it crash like hell ?
2010-11-27T02:41:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	does openshot use gstreamer codecs?
2010-11-27T02:41:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	yes !
2010-11-27T02:45:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	do you know if openshot will allow me to mofify aspect ratio of a video without automatically adding black borders like PiTiVi is doing?
2010-11-27T02:46:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	yes it does !
2010-11-27T02:46:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	if you've used windows movie maker, it's almost the same as that
2010-11-27T02:46:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	easy to use an dmroe stable than any other linux movie editor
2010-11-27T02:47:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	I haven't used WMM much, but I have used everything from Virtualdub, avidemux, even tried lmms.  PiTiVi was the default in 10.10 and the better of the lot *so far*
2010-11-27T02:48:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	for a while, all linux video editors sucked. Then there was openshot
2010-11-27T02:48:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	i'm installing it now, looks promising, but I have my doubts :)
2010-11-27T02:49:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	:d
2010-11-27T02:56:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	openshot appears to have some serious drag and drop issues in the stable release.
2010-11-27T02:57:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	really ? works for me - what kinda issues are you facing ?
2010-11-27T02:58:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	unable to drag video clips onto the timelines, once I finally do get one on the timeline it doesn't "snap" into place and I can actually drag the colored box below the timeline and it sits there.
2010-11-27T02:58:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	oops sorry - but honestly, my experience with it was 10x better than with pitivi, lives, and 2-3 more that I tried
2010-11-27T02:59:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	it was worth a shot, PiTiVi seems much more mature, although much less features at the moment (10.10 repository version of PiTiVi versus the "stable" openshot release)
2010-11-27T03:08:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	have you tried PiTiVi lately?  I had really lost hope for non-linear video editing before I used it in 10.04
2010-11-27T03:08:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	nope - two years ago
2010-11-27T03:08:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	has it improved dramatically since then ?
2010-11-27T03:08:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	I don't know about two years ago, but it is very nice, clean, stable, and fast
2010-11-27T03:09:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	a_bug	I also do not edit THAT much video, so I can't vouch for daily use of it, just occasional use here
2010-11-27T03:09:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	thanks, as long as it doesn't crash
2010-11-27T03:09:00.000Z	a_bug	digitalstimulus	will give it a a try too, thanks
