2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	n-iCe-		how can i know the ip of my machine ?
2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	n-iCe-		in the terminal
2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	ifconfig
2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	though that will only tell you the internal IP - if there's a router or somesuch in the middle, your actual IP will be different
2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	to know your external IP type /whois n-ice-
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	yeah i'm using a router i want to know my real ip
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	189.134.118.88
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	no, it's just your "real" IP on the internet
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	the router will have its own internal IP
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	pastebin your ifconfig
2007-03-20T15:44:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11256/
2007-03-20T15:45:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	so, your *internal* IP is 192.168.1.64. your *router's* internal IP is *probably* 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.1, but you can know by typing "route" (see the "gateway" IP). your *external* IP is the one we've said above
2007-03-20T15:47:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	it doesn't give the address because it gives the "home" plaintext name... but it's going to be 192.168.1.1 really
2007-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	 then the ip is? 192.168.1.0
2007-03-20T15:48:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	no, 192.168.1.1
2007-03-20T15:49:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	look, 192.168.1.64 is the internal IP of your machine, 192.168.1.1 is (most likely) the internal IP of your router, and 189.134.118.88 is the external IP of your router (and yours)
2007-03-20T15:49:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	 then whay i should give to connect
2007-03-20T15:50:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	give... whom?
2007-03-21T16:02:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	 ? to see the ip ?
2007-03-21T16:04:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	 here?
2007-03-21T16:05:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	honestly you're not making any sense to me, perhaps i'm just following too many conversations at once... you *have* all your IPs now - you need to connect to wireless? well, it seems already set up to me
2007-03-21T16:05:00.000Z	n-iCe-	LJL	 no, can you give me agan the command to see my ips ?
2007-03-21T16:08:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	ifconfig tells you your internal IP, and (on IRC) /whois n-ice- tells you your external IP
2007-03-21T16:08:00.000Z	LJL	n-iCe-	i'm missing the command to know your router's IP -- that would be "route" in my case, but in your case it just shows the router's *name* (it's called "home"). try "ping home"
