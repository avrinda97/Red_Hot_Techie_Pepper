2009-10-03T02:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	hmm
2009-10-03T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	What do you want to do?
2009-10-03T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	ok by the sounds of it, there's a problem today with the repos
2009-10-03T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	,becasue of people getting the karmic beta
2009-10-03T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	or whatever
2009-10-03T01:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	  Keiya  try this  system > administration > software sources  and you can tell it to use another mirror some where in there
2009-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	yes  the repos are bad
2009-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	right now, hence your error
2009-10-03T01:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	what are you trying to download from them?
2009-10-03T01:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	it sounds like it's this time again, when the Ubuntu repos go bad for whatever reasons,  and people can't get stuff from them
2009-10-03T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	if you wait two or four days,  things will probably work properly again
2009-10-03T02:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	I mean you haven't changed any of your repos, it's all default yes?
2009-10-03T02:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	What type of update are you trying to do exactly?
2009-10-03T02:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	got2get	why update the package list then?
