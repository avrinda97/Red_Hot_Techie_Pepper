2009-10-08T10:19:00.000Z	nullp0inter		hey guys..i am using split to split a huge file..is there a single command to issue to rename all of my pieces to a .csv extension?
2009-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿SchighSchagh: crontab -e
2009-10-08T10:21:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿SchighSchagh: what kind of script are you trying to run?
2009-10-08T10:22:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿SchighSchagh: but what KIND of script...php bash perl python ruby
2009-10-08T10:23:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿SchighSchagh: in that case it would make it easier if you placed the script in your path
2009-10-08T10:23:00.000Z	nullp0inter		now type crontab -e
2009-10-08T10:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nullp0inter	You can use the "rename" command. If you want to just add .csv to the name try "rename -vn 's/$/\.csv/g' *" if that seems right remove the "-n" to actually change the names ( otherwise it's just a test run )
2009-10-08T10:24:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿Jordan_U: hmm, ill try, but there might be other files in the directory..i want to just rename the extensionless files
2009-10-08T10:24:00.000Z	nullp0inter		﻿SchighSchagh: then how often do you want to run it?
2009-10-08T10:25:00.000Z	nullp0inter		so while in crontab -e...should be a vi editor
2009-10-08T10:25:00.000Z	nullp0inter		put */5 * * * * command
2009-10-08T10:26:00.000Z	nullp0inter		and if needed define SHELL=/bin/bash..or use which bash to find your bash
2009-10-08T10:26:00.000Z	nullp0inter		defne shell before the script command
2009-10-08T10:26:00.000Z	nullp0inter		that should work
2009-10-08T10:27:00.000Z	nullp0inter		i could be wrong(there are tons of diagrams out there) but the 5 stars represent minute hour day week month
2009-10-08T10:28:00.000Z	nullp0inter		and there are key terms like @daily, @weekly, @monthly
2009-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	nullp0inter	Jordan_U	or anyone else: so i need to figure out how to rename only the extensionless files in a directory to .csv extension
2009-10-08T10:29:00.000Z	nullp0inter		i dont know how to form that expression
2009-10-08T10:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nullp0inter	Is there anything else the files have in common than not having an extension?
2009-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	nullp0inter		yes they have the same base file name with numbers at the end..the way split would name files numerically
2009-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	nullp0inter		Jordan_U^^
2009-10-08T10:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nullp0inter	Then just do something like: rename -vn 's/$/\.csv/g' first_part_of_the_name*
2009-10-08T10:32:00.000Z	nullp0inter	Jordan_U	im a doofus...thanks for the help
2009-10-08T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nullp0inter	np :)
