2008-06-11T17:21:00.000Z	Win2Ubuntu		Hi all, Ubuntu seems a bit unstable and does seem to freeze up alot. I'm thinking of making a larger swap partition, how would i go about doing this?
2008-06-11T17:21:00.000Z	Win2Ubuntu		2 gig swap
2008-06-11T17:21:00.000Z	Win2Ubuntu		ram...unsure
2008-06-11T17:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	use gparted to shrink the adjacent partition and expand your swap.. how much ram etc..
2008-06-11T17:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	what version of ubuntu are you running
2008-06-11T17:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	no need to increase swap, I doubt that is the prob
2008-06-11T17:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	Perhaps check dmesg logs ,
2008-06-11T17:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	HAve you tried turning off effects.. just in case
2008-06-11T17:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	you need to run live cd if you want to resize your ubuntu partition
2008-06-11T17:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	gparted live is a good choice
2008-06-11T17:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	what programs open and close on you.
2008-06-11T17:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	if you run from terminal it might show you the error
2008-06-11T17:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	open and freeze
2008-06-11T17:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	if  this is a fresh install I would suggest a reinstall, something is very wrong
2008-06-11T17:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	did you install things manually.. if so like what
2008-06-11T17:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	those can be installed from the repos, did you try and build from source?
2008-06-11T17:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	if you didnt change sources and only use our repos then that is unlikely to be the problem
2008-06-17T16:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Win2Ubuntu	You need to compile the aquarium plugin yourself.. do you need a link
