2005-04-08T11:38:00.000Z	geppy		How do I enable mod_rewrite for apache2 on Ubuntu?
2005-04-08T11:38:00.000Z	geppy		Do I need to recompile it, or is there a package for that?
2005-04-08T11:38:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	check the modules directory.  it may already be included.
2005-04-08T11:39:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Thanks! I'll check. =)
2005-04-08T11:41:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Gallery2 says " Apache mod_rewrite is not installed or not enabled."
2005-04-08T11:44:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	you have to add support cia the confuration files.  the usual place for the modules is /usr/lib/apache2/modults
2005-04-08T11:45:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Thanks!
2005-04-08T11:53:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	 I've found mod_rewrite.load in mods-available;  do I just need to move that to mods-enabled, or is that A Bad Idea(TM)?
2005-04-08T11:53:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	It does a wildcard include of everything in mods-enabled
2005-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	use a symlink instead
2005-04-08T11:55:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled && sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load rewrite.load
2005-04-08T11:55:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Something like that?
2005-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	looks good to me
2005-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Much thanks! =)
2005-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	just remember to restart the server so it can reload the modules
2005-04-08T11:56:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Righto. =)
2005-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	i imagine they have bigger fish to fry as the hoary release is close
2005-04-08T11:57:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	Right.
2005-04-08T11:58:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	But, why hasn't some luser like myself done it?  It couldn't really be that difficult.
2005-04-08T11:58:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	well, why don't you do it? :)
2005-04-08T11:58:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	touch =)
2005-04-08T11:59:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	if the powers that be like it, it's possible
2005-04-08T12:00:00.000Z	caffinated	geppy	at worst it would be an installable package via the repositories
2005-04-08T12:00:00.000Z	geppy	caffinated	=D
