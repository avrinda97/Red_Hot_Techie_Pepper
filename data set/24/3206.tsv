2009-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	mmm4m5m		Hi. Help please. This is ubuntu hardy. Long time back I try suspend, it fail and after reboot, my bios say: "pls. enter setup and fix the settings". My PC was online last 10-15 days. Today morning (5 min back) my PC looks dead and the same story like when I try to suspend. After push "power on", bios say: "pls, enter setup and fix the settings" - all settings was default. What is wrong and how to check this (which log file)?

2009-07-21T11:16:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	gogeta	ubuntu is already running. What I said is: bios told something is wrong, some settings are lost, but bios clock is fine. Then I enter setup, load my old settings from profile 1 (the bios have profiles and I saved my settings as profile 1). Then I reboot and all is just fine.
2009-07-21T11:16:00.000Z	gogeta	mmm4m5m	so the pcs running
2009-07-21T11:17:00.000Z	gogeta	mmm4m5m	then on the next reboot if it still says something worry
2009-07-21T11:18:00.000Z	gogeta	mmm4m5m	mibernate does supend hardware and the bios might have seen it
2009-07-21T11:18:00.000Z	gogeta	mmm4m5m	and complaned
