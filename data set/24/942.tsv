2011-01-07T04:25:00.000Z	kaddi_		hi is there a way to determine the installed programs on a non-booted install? LIke from a live-cd or something?
2011-01-07T04:26:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	why is this a concern? just curious
2011-01-07T04:27:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	my system died and I have an almost complete image of the dead drive, I would like to get a list of what I used to have installed from the image so that I won't spend three weeks trying to remmeber what I had installed
2011-01-07T04:28:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	so you want to know installed "packages" not installed programs
2011-01-07T04:28:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	yes, that's what I meant (to type) but obviously I said something different?
2011-01-07T04:29:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	you said programs
2011-01-07T04:30:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	sorry about that, I meant to say packages
2011-01-07T04:31:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	there's a command you can run, and it will print a list of packages to a file on your desktop.
2011-01-07T04:32:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	see above
2011-01-07T04:32:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	thanks checking it now
2011-01-07T04:34:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	that actualy looks pretty eays... i just tried the first part(to make the list) and it works.... i guess the only issue is getting the list from the borked hard drive, to the "virgin" hard drive
2011-01-07T04:37:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	the challenge is getting this to work for a non booted partition..
2011-01-07T04:37:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	oh.. yeah i dont think you're gonna have any luck there.. the system can't boot at all? even recovery mode?
2011-01-07T04:38:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	nope it's in an eternal bootloop saying sectors are bad when I try
2011-01-07T04:38:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	could you boot a live CD, chmod the drive, and run that command?
2011-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	I have a full image on an external drive here atm
2011-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	the sys partition has been mounted to /media/sys.. do you think I can do it this way?
2011-01-07T04:40:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	how would I proceed with that? force mount the different partitions onto /bin /usr and such?
2011-01-07T04:45:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	how would I do the chmod thing?
2011-01-07T04:45:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	honestly, i'm really not 100% sure
2011-01-07T04:45:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	could you give me some buzzowrds for google? I'm not having much luck finding anything
2011-01-07T04:47:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	i think i'm actually thinkin gof chroot
2011-01-07T04:50:00.000Z	kaddi_	KM0201	shcherbak I'm assuming chroot is something I would not wnat to run from my current install but rathre from a livecd? Or could I just change the chroot for one instalnce of terminal and run dpkg in there?
2011-01-07T04:51:00.000Z	KM0201	kaddi_	i don't think it would really matter
