2012-09-01T12:15:00.000Z	Vasistha		a friend of mine tried to install ubuntu, and he's not getting a boot option, the computer just boots into windows. he selected the install option, "install ubuntu inside windows"
2012-09-01T12:15:00.000Z	Vasistha		what does this mean, "inside windows"? Does it just mean that it's sharing windows' file system? or... I dunno... what does it mean?
2012-09-01T12:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	its inside a image file in windows
2012-09-01T12:17:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	interesting. any idea why the system might not boot?
2012-09-01T12:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	also uses thebwindows nootloader
2012-09-01T12:19:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	does that mean maybe a windows tweak needs to be done in order to make it display the boot menu? Poor dude tried three times and he thinks the installation failed because it never showed an ubuntu boot option
2012-09-01T12:20:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	it should show him a boot option shortly after Windows starts to load
2012-09-01T12:22:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	hmm. he made a video of the installation process, which is here: http://youtu.be/-dNpo0OuRA8
2012-09-01T12:24:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	that's a native
2012-09-01T12:26:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	there should be one maybe that PC has a modded boot
2012-09-01T12:27:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	he needs to check the boot.initial for the Ubuntu entry
2012-09-01T12:28:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	those options are all safe on a wubi it will not replace windows
2012-09-01T12:29:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	yes it does
2012-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	if he inserts the CD in windows it does offer to install inside
2012-09-01T12:36:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	or the install alongside windows option. but if you want to set your own sizes did you have to do it by hand. the do something else option.
2012-09-01T12:37:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	well, I watched this video he made, and there wasn't an option to install alongside windows
2012-09-01T12:37:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	the only options were to install "inside windows" or "replace windows" or do something custom... I forget the wording
2012-09-01T12:38:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	if he does not have Windows installed or it does not see it then the option will not be there
2012-09-01T12:39:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	if he is running Windows 8 this is a known issue
2012-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	I'm pretty sure he has windows 7, the computer is a few years old, he's no techie who would have a windows 8 preview
2012-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	gogeta	Vasistha	sounds like a power management bug
2012-09-01T12:41:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	the caps lock thing? probably. it is sometimes a little annoying, but not enough for me to do anything about it
2012-09-01T12:50:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	oh, I missed a comment of yours earlier, you suggested maybe the pc has a modded boot ... it's a samsung netbook, I mean, maybe it could?
2012-09-01T12:55:00.000Z	Vasistha	gogeta	that wasn't meant for me was it?
