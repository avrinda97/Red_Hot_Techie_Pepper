2006-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	onboard, a sis 661fx chipset.
2006-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	oh, don't know about those
2006-07-04T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	yeah thats the one. thanks.
2006-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	np, gl with your card
2007-03-18T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	wherever you want but some are at /usr/share/pixmaps/
2007-03-18T06:01:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	the "home folder" icon isnt in there, along with all the other generic icons
2007-03-18T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	/usr/share/icons/
2007-03-18T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	what do you want to do?
2007-03-18T06:02:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	i have a link to my home folder on my desktop and im trying to give it its proper icon
2007-03-18T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	it should do that if you use gconf to place HOME on your desktop:
2007-03-18T06:03:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	ahh so thats the proper way to do it?
2007-03-18T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	the link is fine too, but this probably lets GNOME treat it as your $HOME
2007-03-18T06:06:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	thanks that worked a treat
2007-04-27T06:43:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	ah, cheers!
2007-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	err, "glxgears -printfps" does not work.
2007-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	you need to wait a few moments
2007-04-27T06:46:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	no, it gives the same output as any other unrecognised option
2007-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	guess it was removed in the feisty version
2007-04-27T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	ah, mine shows the fps without any options, just type 'glxgears'
2007-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	ahhh so it does, if i give it enough time :P
2007-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	Schalken	jrib	how can i update ubotu?
2007-04-27T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Schalken	you can, but it gets sent for approval
