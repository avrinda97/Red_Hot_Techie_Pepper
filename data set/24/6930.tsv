2005-06-11T09:45:00.000Z	andrewguy		does anyone know if the partitioning tools in the ubuntu install work well on a mac os x file system?
2005-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	No. You must use disk utility to make a macosx partition and leave from free space for the ubuntu tools.
2005-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	blah, i need something to resize my hard drive without having to reformat
2005-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	You _cannot_ resuze the hfsplus partition. Also don't use case sentitive hfsplus, as Linux can't read it.
2005-06-11T09:47:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	There is no such tool for the mac.
2005-06-11T09:47:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	so programs like iPartion and VolumeWorks won't work?
2005-06-11T09:47:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	Ah payware. No idea, never heard of/used them.
2005-06-11T09:48:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	If they can make some free space that the installer can auto-setup (boot aprtition, root and swap) then sure.
2005-06-11T09:48:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	They run Linux very nicely indeed
2005-06-11T09:48:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	alrighty, thanks :D i'll see what i can do
2005-06-11T09:48:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	Just making sound work on mine :-)
2005-06-11T09:50:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	I have 10GB for Linux, but 5Gb should be sufficient. Depends on how much data you're going to store.
2005-06-11T09:51:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	You're not using the new hfs+ version in tiger though, are you?
2005-06-11T09:52:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	i don't know but i am using tigure
2005-06-11T09:52:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	You'll be fine then.
2005-06-11T09:53:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	ahah sweet, ok :D
2005-06-11T09:56:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	Sound probably won't work until after the 2.6.12 kernel is released and alsa 1.0.9 is in ubuntu.
2005-06-11T09:56:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	what? no sound? O.o is it just with ubuntu?
2005-06-11T09:56:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	Linux in general; the kernel doesn't know about the chip (yet)
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	You can manually patch the kernel and package alsa 1.0.9 if you want to
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	andrewguy	cafuego	damn.. cause i'm trying to install it on my friend's computer hahaha trying to lure him into the linux world :/
2005-06-11T09:58:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	I can make the required alsa pkgs available, but you WILL need to patch the kernel for him.
2005-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	No, you need to do both
2005-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	cafuego	andrewguy	Just use the ubuntu source, apply the patch, recompile.
