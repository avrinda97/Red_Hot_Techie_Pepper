2009-11-20T10:40:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	I came in late, what was your problem?
2009-11-20T10:40:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	Trying to figure out what filesystem or image type Brasero uses for disk-to-image copies
2009-11-20T10:40:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	and whether it's mountable
2009-11-20T10:41:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	okay, one moment
2009-11-20T10:42:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	what are the files currently?
2009-11-20T10:43:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	ISO? CUE?
2009-11-20T10:43:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	I don't know what they are...for each disc copy I have a small .toc file and a large disc image with no extension
2009-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	the disc image is a .BIN
2009-11-20T10:48:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	http://he.fi/bchunk/
2009-11-20T10:49:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	did that page help you?
2009-11-20T10:50:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	yes I was looking at bchunk earlier, haven't tried it yet though
2009-11-20T10:50:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	thanks
2009-11-20T10:52:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	Billiard: thanks guys, trying bchunk at the moment
2009-11-20T10:53:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	bchunk should work for you
2009-11-20T11:01:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	Billiard: bchunk isn't working unfortunately; it needs a .bin file and a .cue file. I have .toc files, not .cue files. I tried converting .toc to .cue with cuetools, but it throws an I/O error so the file must have a nonstandard syntax or something. Brasero has really done a number on me here...
2009-11-20T11:03:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	try bin2iso
2009-11-20T11:03:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	apt-get should have it
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	i lied
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	one moment
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	http://users.eastlink.ca/~doiron/bin2iso/
2009-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	ah thanks for the link, knew it wasn't in the repos
2009-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	Hmm...looks like I spoke too soon. The WAV files are corrupt. Dang! I was so close
2009-11-20T11:50:00.000Z	Geistanon	noir	losha, it was a bin
2009-11-20T11:58:00.000Z	noir	Geistanon	wait like what work? ripping CDs? Sure. As a rule I've never burned CDs from the command line though.
