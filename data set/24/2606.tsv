2010-06-25T15:12:00.000Z	Dynetrekk		hi, i'm considering using either ubuntu or ubuntu server. I have an old desktop I want to use ubuntu on, but I will mainly be using it as a file server; however, I'd also like to be able to do some minimal GUI stuff on it, like firefox
2010-06-25T15:13:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 fluxbox is an great lightweight window manager. as is windowmaker
2010-06-25T15:13:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	but ubuntu, or ubuntu server?
2010-06-25T15:15:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	sounds good then... the server edition has less stuff in it?
2010-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 I've not used ubuntu-server for several releases. but that is the jist
2010-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	sounds good for my nefarious purposes
2010-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 maybe just screen and links2 will suit you then?
2010-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	screen and links2? what is that?
2010-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 screen is a terminal app that lets you have multiple shells open simultaneously.  links2 is an ncurses based browser with graphic support
2010-06-25T15:19:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	ah, I know links, or lynx, I've sen one of them before. I'd prefer firefox, I'd say.
2010-06-25T15:19:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 hehe, just depends on how minimal you want to go :)
2010-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	sure, but if I have to learn new stuff, it will take me more effort than I'd care to.
2010-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	I will of course install ssh-server and tell it what to do from my laptop ASAP anyway.
2010-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 effort + learning = hacking = good
2010-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	I agree, for most purposes
2010-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	is it problematic to set up network services on ubuntu desktop?
2010-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	I agree :)
2010-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	I'll have to look up derogative to be sure, but sounds right
2010-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 no. ifconfig and man are your friends
2010-06-25T15:23:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	great, thanks... I'm thinking about SSH and possibly some network file share to have at home
2010-06-25T15:24:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	is the alternate install CD faster?
2010-06-25T15:24:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 less than an hour either way
2010-06-25T15:25:00.000Z	Dynetrekk	AAA	I'll try alternate just for the hacking of it then
2010-06-25T15:26:00.000Z	AAA	Dynetrekk	 I like your style
