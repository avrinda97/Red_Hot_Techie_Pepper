2011-01-07T06:26:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	Try using a livecd or other bootable medium to boot that up and run fsck on your system's filesystem
2011-01-07T06:27:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	yes, i did this
2011-01-07T06:27:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	http://pastebin.com/YX7B7sjs
2011-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	Have you tried mounting and dismounting the filesystem?
2011-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	no, should I?
2011-01-07T06:30:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	Try to mount, unmount, and then do the fsck
2011-01-07T06:30:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	ok
2011-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	"mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1" stalls
2011-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	I have no clue what is wrong then :| I'm sorry
2011-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	np, thank you
2011-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	maybe one more thing, which graphics card do you use? After one of my PCs updated to 10.10 I noticed it didn't work anymore with the dedicated graphics card in it
2011-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	with the same problems
2011-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	equivoc	Dark_Spyro_003	03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation ION VGA (rev b1)
2011-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	Dark_Spyro_003	equivoc	Probably isn't that then... Wish you luck in finding a solution though!
