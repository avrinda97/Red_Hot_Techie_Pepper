2010-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	in rc2.d change the link forgdm from starting with S to starting with K is all
2010-06-06T12:30:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I see no "gdm"
2010-06-06T12:31:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	it will be something like   S99gdm   or similar
2010-06-06T12:31:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I searched for "gdm" using the search tool, and nothing.
2010-06-06T12:32:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	which ubuntu are you using?
2010-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	in terminal do   ls /etc/rc2.d | grep dm
2010-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	K?
2010-06-06T12:33:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	What's that do?
2010-06-06T12:34:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	did you find it?
2010-06-06T12:34:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	flametai1@flametai1-desktop:~$ ls /etc/rc2.d | grep dm
2010-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	seems you're not using a *dm then
2010-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I have a NVidia card
2010-06-06T12:36:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	that shouldn't matter :]
2010-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	can you paste what   ls /etc/rc2.d   returns?
2010-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I already did it returns nothing lawl, also do you know how I would stop the X Server?
2010-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	that was a diff command then
2010-06-06T12:42:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	what does the login window look like? - and does   sudo service gdm stop   kill X?
2010-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I got it I think
2010-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	great! I think... :]
2010-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	I never got the level thing but I know how to kill X server now
2010-06-06T12:57:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	What's the chances of a driver update going wrong?
2010-06-06T12:57:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	it can happen but it isn't common for the non proprietry drivers to fail
2010-06-06T14:40:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	FlameTai1	you could try in terminal   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   to see if it pulls in any missing packages
2010-06-06T14:41:00.000Z	FlameTai1	well_laid_lawn	Checked, all is good.
