2009-10-06T12:16:00.000Z	soreau		I told you how to fix it
2009-10-06T12:17:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	xrandr is supported on the 4XXX series last I checked
2009-10-06T12:17:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	no need for compiz++
2009-10-06T12:18:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	compiz++ overcomes the max testure size problem. With compiz as it is now, running it on higher resolutions than the MTS for the card will result in corruption past the MTS resolution
2009-10-06T12:18:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	xrandr doesn't help in this case
2009-10-06T12:18:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	yeah, but if he's only setting his virtual size as 4096 then that's the same as the MTS on the 4K series
2009-10-06T12:20:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Compiz works but he doesn't want to lower his resolution to fix it
2009-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	the hell kind of resolution is he using?
2009-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Dual monitor too large for his cards MTS
2009-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	obviously, that means he must have 30" monitors or something
2009-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Resolution has nothing to do with the size of the monitors
2009-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	His cards MTS is 2048 and one of his resolution dimensions is 2560 (1280x2)
2009-10-06T12:23:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	I thought he had a 4XXX card?  Thought those took 4096 pixel textures
2009-10-06T12:24:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Well maybe you're right. I never did get the output of 'glxinfo -l|grep -i max_texture_size' from him
2009-10-06T12:24:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	If that were the case, the Virtual line I gave him was supposed to fix it but he typoed or something and goofed the X conf file so X failed to start
2009-10-06T12:27:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Yea, I was right. MTS=2048
2009-10-06T12:27:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	what, really?  that's weird
2009-10-06T12:27:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Not really :P
2009-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	Yea most intel and some older radeons have MTS of 2048
2009-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	My ancient nvidia GeForce3 has 4096 even
2009-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	oh fail, I saw X4500 and misread it as Radeon 4XXX
2009-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	that would explain it!
2009-10-06T12:29:00.000Z	soreau	snuxoll	heh, I don't know the difference for Intel hw ;)
2009-10-06T12:29:00.000Z	snuxoll	soreau	intel chips ):
