2005-12-05T08:51:00.000Z	bob832		hey, this probably is a newbie question but firestarter is showing a bunch of blocked connections on ports 137/138 to samba - is this normal?
2005-12-05T08:51:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	pretty normal on mine
2005-12-05T08:53:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	your machine spamming others?
2005-12-05T08:53:00.000Z	bob832	mustard5	 thats what the university's cisco system said
2005-12-05T08:54:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	your linux box?
2005-12-05T08:54:00.000Z	bob832	mustard5	yep
2005-12-05T08:54:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	do you let other people use it?
2005-12-05T08:54:00.000Z	bob832	mustard5	no, i am the only user
2005-12-05T08:55:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	hmmm seems strange...you using a strong password?
2005-12-05T08:56:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	so you were testing your security on sheildsup?
2005-12-05T08:56:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	often the ends up scanning the proxy you connect through I believe and not your machine
2005-12-05T08:57:00.000Z	bob832	mustard5	oh, thats probably what happened then - and they by doing that, i triggered the cisco system to lock me out
2005-12-05T08:58:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	I was testing on sheildsup and wondered why my ports weren't showing as hidden and then it was explained to me that it was my ISP's ports that were not sheilded, so the scan report was erroneous
2005-12-05T08:59:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	you may be the victim of an over-zealous administrator :)
2005-12-05T09:00:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	yeah..I doubt your box got hacked :)
2005-12-05T09:00:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	not unless someone had physical access to it
2005-12-05T09:01:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	do you run any services on the box? like ssh? or web server or ftp server?
2005-12-05T09:12:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	I wouldnt want to test it :)
2005-12-05T09:13:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	explain what you found about sheildsup before setting off any more alarms with the admins
2005-12-05T09:13:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	I strongly doubt you've been hacked
2005-12-05T09:14:00.000Z	bob832	mustard5	 you mean the results i got on sunday?
2005-12-05T09:14:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	yeah
2005-12-05T09:14:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	I reckon that is what the issue was...
2005-12-05T09:14:00.000Z	mustard5	bob832	sheildsup was probably port scanning them on not your machine
