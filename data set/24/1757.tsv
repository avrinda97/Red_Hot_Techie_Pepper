2009-09-06T12:06:00.000Z	zachk18		can somebody help me please?
2009-09-06T12:06:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	probably not until you've stated the problem
2009-09-06T12:11:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	and you won't, if you expect instant results and people to know what you're talking about... also, if you're impatient.
2009-09-06T12:12:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	it would be helpful if you could pastebin the errors
2009-09-06T12:12:00.000Z	zachk18	Gnea	i've been dealing with this for five days now plus I already know of Help.ubuntu.com and I post much on the ubuntu forums..and
2009-09-06T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	look, I'm sorry you've been having so many problems, but this isn't a gym filled with punching bags for you to whine at - please, if you want to be respected, you're simply going to have to show it. if you're tired of showing respect, we will certainly be tired of you.
2009-09-06T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	and, again, please use pastebin. pasting in here will get you permanently removed.
2009-09-06T12:15:00.000Z	zachk18	Gnea	could you give me some instruction on how to install firebird2? because when i do supposedly it's supposed to automatically start and ask what kind of server you want, firebird user and stuff like that...it never does...ever
2009-09-06T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	never installed firebird, so wouldn't know where to start, other than with sudo apt-get install firebird
2009-09-06T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	please pastebin the errors.
2009-09-06T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	this is your last warning - use http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	right, if you do this:  apt-cache search firebird super server, you will see that it does not, indeed, exist.
2009-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	the apache notices are normal, you'll just have to configure apache to not say that anymore, pretty standard
2009-09-06T12:26:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	there's no error there. that's perfectly normal operation.
2009-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	you're freaking out about nothing, and you're trying to install soemthing that is called something else.
2009-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	I am relaxed.  did you find it?
2009-09-06T12:37:00.000Z	zachk18	Gnea	http://paste.ubuntu.com/265963/
2009-09-06T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	zachk18	and the problem here would be...?
