2006-03-30T14:52:00.000Z	zF		I need a Windows install so I can play Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
2006-03-30T14:52:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	depends... It is not too difficult if you have some idea of disk partitioning and backups.
2006-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	ahhhh Oblivion...
2006-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	considered Cedega/WineX?
2006-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	eh, I'm not really looking to get that setup.
2006-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	can I do it solely with cfdisk?
2006-03-30T14:54:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	then install Windows on that partition - then use a Live CD to reinstall Grub somehow?
2006-03-30T14:55:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	you should really backup, and use 'parted' to resize.
2006-03-30T14:56:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	back up?
2006-03-30T14:56:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	well, shrinking a partition is a rather risky operation.
2006-03-30T14:58:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	what is partd? and what do you mean by backup?
2006-03-30T14:58:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	'parted'
2006-03-30T14:59:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	what do you mean by backup? is probably the single scariest question (for yourself) that you can ask :-)
2006-03-30T14:59:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	does that make it relatively easy?
2006-03-30T14:59:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	'parted' and 'qtparted' (the GUI counterpart) make it easier indeed.
2006-03-30T15:00:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	by "back-up" do you mean just... back up my files?
2006-03-30T15:00:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	yes :-)
2006-03-30T15:00:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	right. Thanks. Is qtparted in the repositories?
2006-03-30T15:01:00.000Z	zF		 NickGarvey, thanks - a useful command in the future :)
2006-03-30T15:02:00.000Z	Blissex	zF	the best way to do this things is always to have a spare backup disk, create a new set of partitions, and copy your stuff over in  the !info parted
2006-03-30T15:02:00.000Z	Blissex		!info parted
2006-03-30T15:03:00.000Z	zF	Blissex	do you recommend I backup just my MBR, I'm confused
