2007-06-25T05:41:00.000Z	nico_		the offtopic thing is getting anoying
2007-06-25T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	this channel is too busy, the only way to keep it useful is to ask non support discussions to move to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	is your script executable?
2007-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	it is
2007-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	the script works OK if i run it from the CLI
2007-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	"nothing happens" means what exactly?  Does it ask you for a new location?  or close but your script does not appear in the menu? etc....
2007-11-03T23:13:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	well once i've selected the script, gnome is supposed to run it with the right-clicked file as a parameter (i think). well it doesn't
2007-11-03T23:14:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	the result appearing the same to me: the file that the script is supposed to create when it runs with the right-clicked file as param is not created
2007-11-03T23:16:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	so you do get the option to open the program with your script, but your script just doesn't do what you expect, correct?
2007-11-03T23:16:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	wait i'm wrong... it works, it's just that the output file of the script is created in $HOME, while i expected it in the same directory as the one that contains the input file
2007-11-03T23:17:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	the script works ok it's just that gnome runs it from $HOME instead of from the directory that contains the right-clicked file :-/
2007-11-03T23:17:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	is it possible to modify that?
2007-11-03T23:19:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	just get the dirname from the argument
2007-11-03T23:20:00.000Z	nico_	jrib	ya but that would require me to re-learn perl :p
2007-11-03T23:20:00.000Z	jrib	nico_	heh
