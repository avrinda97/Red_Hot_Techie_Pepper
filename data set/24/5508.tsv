2006-10-26T09:54:00.000Z	bastiq		Anyone know why my X server won't start after i installed the nvidia drivers? It says it can't detect my display.
2006-10-26T09:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	Did it say 'No Screens found'?
2006-10-26T09:55:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Possible, but i think is was something about displays.
2006-10-26T09:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	I'd have to see all the real errors
2006-10-26T09:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	are you dual-booting or something?
2006-10-26T09:55:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	That could be tricky, im in the command line. Yes, im dual-booting.
2006-10-26T09:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	Alright, I need you to reboot to ubuntu and after X fails to start and you're at the command line run 'cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE'
2006-10-26T09:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	And look for any obvious 'oops' errors
2006-10-26T09:57:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Damn, i missed it and i'm short of a scroll atm :P
2006-10-26T09:58:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Rebooting now, i'll be right back.
2006-10-26T09:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	alright
2006-10-26T10:03:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	The error was "No Decices Detected"
2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	nothing else?
2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Nope. That was the only EE
2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	ouchie
2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	If you switch back to the 'nv' or 'vesa' drivers does it work?
2006-10-26T10:04:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Nope.
2006-10-26T10:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-10-26T10:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	actually, wait
2006-10-26T10:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2006-10-26T10:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastiq	see if it works with a stock xorg.conf
2006-10-26T10:06:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Thanks, i'll be right back.
2006-10-26T10:08:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Yes, it did work. Thanks, but how do i get the nvidia driver to work?
2006-10-26T10:18:00.000Z	bastiq	Amaranth	Thanks, it's working super now :)
