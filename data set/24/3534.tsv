2008-02-10T23:37:00.000Z	bofh80		hi people, would anyone like to help me turn off my SWAP so i can test a memory problem i'm having with wine, i have 2gig of memory, ubuntu 7.10. cheers :) forums are down :(
2008-02-10T23:37:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	man swapoff
2008-02-10T23:37:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	cool. :)
2008-02-10T23:39:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	so it's safe to just type swapoff -a . and the system won't crash or nothing :D
2008-02-10T23:42:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	ok, is that switch permanent? i think i need to reboot, as system monitor reports 0 swap space, but things are still using Virtual Memory
2008-02-10T23:42:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	what is the output of "free". and no it'S not permanent
2008-02-10T23:42:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	when there is no swap there is no virtual memory...
2008-02-10T23:43:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	free says SWAP 0 0 0 0 sorta thing, but on the Virtual Memory column of system monitor, when i close and open say notepad.exe it still seems to allocate itself 2.6gig of VM :(
2008-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	how do i make it permanent i will reboot it with no swap i guess. ?
2008-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	I want your free output. not your wrong interpretation of cluelessness
2008-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	remove it from fstab
2008-02-10T23:46:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55502/    <free output. i shall comment out my fstab line for the swap then too :)
2008-02-10T23:47:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	that output does not match my system monitor
2008-02-10T23:48:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	what software is this "monitor"?
2008-02-10T23:48:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	the gnome system monitor
2008-02-10T23:48:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	according to that output i have no memory free of my 2gig?!
2008-02-10T23:48:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	free memory is wasted memory
2008-02-10T23:51:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	another FREE output, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55503/    . i have only xchat and a terminal running, surely it should report more free memory than that?!?!?!
2008-02-10T23:52:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	if you ever have a lot of free memory, your linux is broken
2008-02-10T23:52:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	again: free memory is WASTED memory
2008-02-10T23:53:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	ok. guess i'll man free :)  - i'm going to comment out my swap and reboot. i don't need to do anything else? (ie the system aint gonna die on reboot if i do that)
2008-02-10T23:54:00.000Z	erawfish	bofh80	if your ubuntu ever runs out of memory it simply kills random processes
2008-02-10T23:54:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	cool.
2008-02-10T23:54:00.000Z	bofh80	erawfish	thanks very much for your time, a great help :)
