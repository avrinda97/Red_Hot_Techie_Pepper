2010-04-05T01:21:00.000Z	Griffinzz		would I be correct in that you can't burn images of ubuntu onto a dvdRW?
2010-04-05T01:21:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	no cd images, but a dvd image
2010-04-05T01:26:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	yeah, looks like that's my solutin as well here
2010-04-05T01:27:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	neeed help /w usb install ?
2010-04-05T01:31:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	nah, did it with this acer aspire so it should be fine, but found that alchohol120 might ba able to burn cd images to dvd's
2010-04-05T01:32:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	I was just looking around, it seems you have to be able to choose dvd image to burn, then point it to the cd.iso, I long ago tried to just burn cd.iso to dvd > fail
2010-04-05T01:33:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	it seems nero manages after all, just opened the iso file and check a DVD high compatability option
2010-04-05T01:34:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	feedback if you where succesfull, I went to usb or iso-install in generall, as it saves all kind of disks for me
2010-04-05T01:35:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	in principle I agree, but usb ports ara a bit unstable for speed so cd images area preferred...and I don't have enough usb sticks atm
2010-04-05T01:36:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	my usb's are faster then cd, also  noise/mechanics, much nicer, but go ahead, I'm curious about that
2010-04-05T01:37:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	won't get to test it for a while, curretnly in an endless press enter phase n fsck
2010-04-05T01:37:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	ic (there is a yes to all questions option, FYI)
2010-04-05T01:38:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	when starting fsck, I guess?
2010-04-05T01:39:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	that would be option -p?
2010-04-05T01:40:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	p is preen -y it is
2010-04-05T01:41:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	thanks, I'll just go out of fsck and use that then
2010-04-05T01:41:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	can do so, ctrl-c
2010-04-05T01:51:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	buring ISO to dvd worked fine, currenty started up on xubuntu 9.10 livedisk on dvd :)
2010-04-05T01:52:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	nice, wait for install before waving :)
2010-04-05T01:52:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	if it boots, it works is my motto :p
2010-04-05T01:53:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	oo
2010-04-05T02:40:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	I still don't understand why xubuntu livedisk won't mount hdd while ubuntu does...
2010-04-05T02:40:00.000Z	DasEi1	Griffinzz	it doesn't by default, unless you call it under places/nautilus/whatever
2010-04-05T02:41:00.000Z	Griffinzz	DasEi1	it doesn't even appear in thunar or places, which is why I found it weird
