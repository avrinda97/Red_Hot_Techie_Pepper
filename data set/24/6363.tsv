2006-11-13T16:05:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	ok
2007-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	Are you up to date in your edgy updates?
2007-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	very
2007-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	fresh install && update && upgrade
2007-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	oh.  Do you have edgy-updates enabled?
2007-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	hmm... not sure..?
2007-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	if it's not by default, then no
2007-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	I have no idea if it's default.  But I believe you need it.
2007-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	and what is it?
2007-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	the edgy-updates repositories.  just like there's 'edgy' and 'edgy-backports' and stuff.
2007-03-26T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	pastebin your sources.list
2007-03-26T16:33:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	found it, and it's enabled
2007-03-26T16:33:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	I'll try enabling the rest of the basic repos
2007-03-26T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	hmm.  I'm not sure.  You might ask in #ubuntu+1, they'll probably know precisely what is wrong.
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	would you believe it... it was caused by gksudo
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	with sudo, it works
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	(and i found out by trial and error) :)
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	thats... hmm.  Oh, try using gksu instead.  And putting "update-manager -d" in quotes.
2007-03-26T16:40:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	well, I already ran it with sudo
2007-03-26T16:41:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	or do you suppose gksudo only takes the first argument as the command?
2007-03-26T16:43:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	 right.  Well, that's just an issue with the wiki, forinstance, with the edgy upgrade: gksu "update-manager -c" is the command.
2007-03-26T16:43:00.000Z	Flannel	jenda	it has to do with gksudo parsing the -d instead of passing it.  Thats why you need to quote.
2007-03-26T16:44:00.000Z	jenda	Flannel	ook
