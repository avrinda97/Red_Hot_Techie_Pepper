2009-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	tado		hey all. thunderbird doesn't allow me to save passwords. any ideas?
2009-11-25T16:09:00.000Z	drellok	tado	what is the error message?
2009-11-25T16:11:00.000Z	tado	drellok	there is no errror message. it just won't show the checkbox at the beginning of the session
2009-11-25T16:14:00.000Z	drellok	tado	see the second paragraph here http://kb.mozillazine.org/Password_not_remembered_(Thunderbird)
2009-11-25T16:15:00.000Z	tado	drellok	i have tried that, but it still doesn't show the checkbox
2009-11-25T16:17:00.000Z	drellok	tado	did the parameter change back to false when you started thunderbird?
2009-11-25T16:17:00.000Z	tado	drellok	nope. it remains on true
2009-11-25T16:18:00.000Z	tado	drellok	i'm editing it from the edit config under edit->preferences
2009-11-25T16:20:00.000Z	drellok	tado	can you paste your prefs.js file to pastebin?
2009-11-25T16:23:00.000Z	tado	drellok	it's the one in etc/thunderbird/profile right? it's here http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/327553/
2009-11-25T16:26:00.000Z	drellok	tado	this file should be located in ~/.mozilla-thunderbird<Profile name>/ or ~/.thunderbird/<Profile name>/
2009-11-25T16:26:00.000Z	drellok	tado	<Profile name> is your unique profile name
2009-11-25T16:28:00.000Z	tado	drellok	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/327555/
2009-11-25T16:33:00.000Z	drellok	tado	you can try to insert into this file user_pref("signon.rememberSignons", true);
2009-11-25T16:33:00.000Z	drellok	tado	and restart thunderbird
2009-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	tado	drellok	didn't work. but i tried to rename the .mozilla-thunderbird folder to make it create a new one. i set up an account and it shows the checkbox now
2009-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	drellok	tado	cool.. so the problem definetely was in configs
2009-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	tado	drellok	yep. but now i'm not sure i know how to import in the new one all the old files, to have mail, addons and settings as in the old one, without importing the problem
2009-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	drellok	tado	you can try to restore back old .mozilla-thunderbird and place prefs.js file from a new one.. this will show if the problem is tied to this file
2009-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	tado	drellok	oh, yes. one sec
2009-11-25T16:41:00.000Z	drellok	tado	also save the old prefs.js
2009-11-25T16:41:00.000Z	tado	drellok	sure
2009-11-25T16:43:00.000Z	tado	drellok	it works. now i can maybe try a long work of copy pasting the pref one by one and see what messes it up
2009-11-25T16:43:00.000Z	drellok	tado	yes, this should work :)
