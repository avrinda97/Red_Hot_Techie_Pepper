2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		but I know that other people have gotten it to work
2006-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	Rappermas		however, google isn't very helpful
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		i don't know, i just figured that there would be someone here that does development in OpenGL
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		i'm sure you guys wouldn't be too happy if I was working on a Windows DirectX engine :D
2006-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	Rappermas		!opengl
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		yes, the graphics are amazing
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		running OpenGL
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		but since I switched Ubuntu I can't program anymore
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		I was going to do a few bug fixes and then work on audio today
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	Rappermas		but I can't even compile the engine
2006-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	what's your problem?
2006-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	check out nehe opengl
2006-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	nehe is windows, besides, I know way more about OpenGL than that tutorial (but it did help!)
2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	also, install apt-file (sudo apt-get install apt-file) then do "apt-file search glu.h"
2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	nehe isn't just windows, it's available for loads of platforms
2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	i thought it was a tutorial targeted at Windows
2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	nope
2006-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	wow, that's changed then
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	it's been multiplatform for about 5 years
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	how come I never noticed?
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	you never looked?
2006-11-04T16:03:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	i looked...but...wow, maybe i forgot to get sleep or something
2006-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	bobbyd	Rappermas	anyway, do what I said and you'll find the package containing glu.h
2006-11-04T16:04:00.000Z	Rappermas	bobbyd	it's a broken package
