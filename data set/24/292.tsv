2011-12-21T05:19:00.000Z	Scriven		using a sony gps unit reportedly.
2011-12-21T05:19:00.000Z	Scriven		it's marketed as a GPS1100U
2011-12-21T05:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	what useful data is missing?
2011-12-21T05:22:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	AFAIK there is no useful satellite data coming through. I'm wondering first how to do basic hardware verification. IE, is this device working.
2011-12-21T05:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	what did you install to take the data and use it?
2011-12-21T05:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	so, you have installed a piece of hardware and it produces output, but you can't trust it, given that its gps I would continue to not trust it till you can get it to place a big X on a chart and agree that is where you are at on earth
2011-12-21T05:27:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	that's exactly where I'm at.
2011-12-21T05:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	opencpn will take the input from a gps and locate you on a chart, given that it already has the chart
2011-12-21T05:27:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	the various programs that are supposed to the "you are here" mapping for me fail to do anything useful.
2011-12-21T05:27:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	trying it.
2011-12-21T05:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	also there is a better app from win called 'seaclear' and it runs in wine and it will take the gps input, I have used it a lot more than opencpn
2011-12-21T05:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	seaclear with gps and the correct chart of your area, can be trusted, well, I have trusted it
2011-12-21T05:30:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	So is that a basic setup, if it doesn't work there's hardware issues? It would be nice for me to at least eliminate busted hardware at some point.
2011-12-21T05:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	you should be able to see output, the output will look like greek without something for it to actually put a big X on, then where the X lies better be where you are at
2011-12-21T05:33:00.000Z	Scriven	almoxarife	is there some place I can just get that stream from gpspipe -r verified?
2011-12-21T05:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	no idea, do you see the output coords? does the coords match reality?
2011-12-21T05:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	correct
2011-12-21T05:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	you have wine ?
2011-12-21T05:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	find 'seaclear' , you near a US waterway?
2011-12-21T05:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	near san juan de fuqua channel?
2011-12-21T05:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	great, use the US charts for the area nearest your location, with seaclear you will get a little boat planted on top of your location
2011-12-21T05:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	unless you want to pay for canadian charts, you guys are cheap
2011-12-21T05:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	this is getting off topic, if you need more help, pm me
2011-12-21T05:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	Scriven	zero lat, zero long
