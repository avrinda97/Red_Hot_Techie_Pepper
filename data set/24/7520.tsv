2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	One moment, please. :)
2005-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Ubuntu uses 'esd' to make that happen.
2005-06-15T07:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Change *what* to esd?
2005-06-15T07:34:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Be specific!
2005-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	I know the general symptom.  You have to be specific.
2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	I've been using GNU/Linux for six years.  I know a lot about sound issues.  To tell you how to configure your programs right, you must first tell me which programs you want configured.
2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Cool.  Let me look that program up.
2005-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	I mean, sorry.
2005-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Do you click a menu item?
2005-06-15T07:39:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Okay.  Please try this:
2005-06-15T07:42:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Tee, hee.  Kubuntu is cute sometimes.
2005-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	 You must go to #kubuntu and ask them how they suggest you do DSP sharing.
2005-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Tell them that you're trying to run teamspeak, but that when you do, it blocks sound for other program.
2005-06-15T07:44:00.000Z	paulproteus	_Church_of_Foamy	Sure thing.  Thank me when it works. ;)
