2010-07-11T04:59:00.000Z	waiting		so am i being shunned from the ubuntu community, because my question wasn't easy to answer.  I'm part of the way there.  why is my computer problem less valid than other peoples? if you can't answer my computer trouble just say so.

2010-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	waiting		i've made things worse by following instructions from here.  the terminal at least used to try to download.
2010-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	waiting		it used to go to 98% and fail.  but now it won't even start
2010-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	That's because you've got another one open.  Please pastebin the output of `ps aux`
2010-07-11T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	Can you please make your terminal larger and do it again?  Things got cropped off and it's making it difficult to identify
2010-07-11T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	ps aux, again
2010-07-11T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	That's the same.  See how the right side gets cut off mid commmand at the bottom?  Lets do this instead, `ps aux > ~/running.txt` and then open ~/running.txt and copy/paste it.
2010-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	waiting	Flannel	i copied you command you told me "ps aux > ~/running.txt" and it didn't seem to do anything
2010-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	It didn't give any output, but what it did was create a text file called running.txt in your homedir, open that file and then copy/paste the contents of it
2010-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	Are you only in the terminal?
2010-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	GUI would probably be easier for you.  Just find the file (places > home) and double click it.
2010-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	Perfect, thanks.
2010-07-11T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	alright, do you still get the error from `sudo apt-get update`?
2010-07-11T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	What version of Ubuntu are you on?
2010-07-11T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	`lsb_release -a` will tell you

2010-07-11T05:27:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	That'll work for your sources.list
2010-07-11T05:29:00.000Z	waiting	Flannel	i already replaced the text in sources.list to what now works for at least updating.  the list to copy was sent by another user and there was way more text than that.  should i add these ones or leave my, now working repositories as is.
2010-07-11T05:30:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	If you've already got somethign working, then don't worry about it.
2010-07-11T05:31:00.000Z	waiting	Flannel	back when people were telling me to run 'sudo apt-get update' they were also telling me to type in a second command too.  do you have any idea what that may have been?  another part of the update?
2010-07-11T05:31:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	After updating, `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` would work
2010-07-11T05:34:00.000Z	waiting	Flannel	what does sudo apt-get dist-upgrade do
2010-07-11T05:37:00.000Z	Flannel	waiting	It'll upgrade all of your software to the latest versions in the repositories
