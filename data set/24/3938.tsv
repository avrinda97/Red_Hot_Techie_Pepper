2007-09-01T13:21:00.000Z	xero9364		I started beryl under a failsafe xterm to make sure it is NOT my vid card.
2007-09-01T13:22:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	what is on the screen?
2007-09-01T13:22:00.000Z	xero9364		A failsafe XTerm running Bitchx

2007-09-01T13:22:00.000Z	xero9364		No err message or anything.
2007-09-01T13:23:00.000Z	warbler		xreo9364: what do you get at the login?
2007-09-01T13:23:00.000Z	xero9364		warbler I get GDM, I log in, and nothing shows up whatsoever except the Ubuntu colors on the background.
2007-09-01T13:24:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	sounds like a graphic card issue - what's the card?
2007-09-01T13:24:00.000Z	xero9364	warbler	I have beryl running. It is NOT the card.
2007-09-01T13:25:00.000Z	xero9364		limewire.
2007-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	disable beryl and check your driver - beryl might be wrong for the driver or something similar - lol
2007-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	xero9364		warbler I do not have it set up to start Beryl at gnome startup.
2007-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	xero9364		It is, once again, not the card.
2007-09-01T13:26:00.000Z	xero9364		I've had the card working for 2 months.
2007-09-01T13:27:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	why do you KNOW it is not the card - could be the wrong driver
2007-09-01T13:27:00.000Z	xero9364	warbler	I am using the nvidia proprietary 9639 and have had it working for 2 months.
2007-09-01T13:27:00.000Z	xero9364		It is not the driver or the card. It is GNOME itself, a library it depends on, or a pebkac.
2007-09-01T13:27:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	what did you do to stop it working?
2007-09-01T13:28:00.000Z	xero9364	warbler	I upgraded to Gutsy.
2007-09-01T13:29:00.000Z	warbler	xero9364	ahhh... - there is a chat for gutsy probs - #ubuntu+1 - they might know
