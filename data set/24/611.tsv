2011-05-01T20:48:00.000Z	Stameni		how do i acces system tray
2011-05-01T20:49:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	you can configure that in ccsm.
2011-05-01T20:50:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	how ?
2011-05-01T20:51:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	look in ccsm. You'll find it. Or in dconf-editor. It is possible.
2011-05-01T20:53:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	is that a bug in unity and it will be fixed or it will stay forever like that ?
2011-05-01T20:54:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	it's not a bug. We don't like the abuse of notification area and want to change that behaviour.
2011-05-01T20:59:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	thank you, i`ll install ccsm and try to make it that way
2011-05-01T20:54:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	but it is configurable. You can change it if you really want to have it that way, but I can't recommend it.
2011-05-01T20:54:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	so xchat, amsn and all other stuff that have "go in system tray on "x"" just disapear
2011-05-01T20:55:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	yes, unless you configure them to be exceptions. Preferably, they'll provide their own indicators instead.
2011-05-01T20:56:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	thanks for answering. ( btw, i really don't like that new behavior )
2011-05-01T20:56:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	I think notifications should notify you of something. That's not the case today, so it needs to be changed.
2011-05-01T20:57:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	we users get used to some stuff :)
2011-05-01T20:57:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	also we would like to have an intelligible system, which means that features acts in the same ways. Indicators achieve that. Notifications doesn't.
2011-05-01T20:58:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	skype has no problems going in the upper bar when i say "stay in system tray when i click "x" "
2011-05-01T20:58:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	that has nothing to do with unity ?
2011-05-01T20:59:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	I've been trying to tell you that it is no problem to do it. You just need to add the name of the command, and it'll be added to the indicators as you expect. Skype is a preconfigured exception.
2011-05-01T21:00:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	it may be a dconf setting. Let me have a look.
2011-05-01T21:00:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	i don't have that eather, i`ll install it
2011-05-01T21:02:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	can i pm you ?
2011-05-01T21:02:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	no. 1) Install apt://dconf-editor 2) look up /desktop/unity/panel. You'll find it there.
2011-05-01T21:03:00.000Z	Stameni	jo-erlend_	ok, tnx
2011-05-01T21:03:00.000Z	jo-erlend_	Stameni	it should be self-explanatory, but if not, ask again :)
