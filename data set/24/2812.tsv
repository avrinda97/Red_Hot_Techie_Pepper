2009-05-11T03:28:00.000Z	markg85		Hi all, I have an issue getting intelfb working on my noteboot (Ubuntu 9.04 x64 with intel 945GM). I've removed the intelfb from the blacklist and added: fbcon, agp, agpgart, intel_agp and intelfb to the modules that need to be loaded. That all followed by a "update-initramfs -u". Now the issue when i reboot with the video=intelfb in gruk i get: "intelfb: cannot acquire agp".... Could someone help me to get this working? Thanx.
2009-05-11T03:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	its working fine for me w/ 32bit..
2009-05-11T03:29:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	how did you set it up?
2009-05-11T03:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	worked out fo the box.. no probs.. 3D didn't work, but I was told to enable proposed updates in the repositories.. i did, and when i updated, it updated the intel driver and it worked fine
2009-05-11T03:30:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	oing to test that now.
2009-05-11T03:30:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	just out of curiosity.. Where did you read that?
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	honestly, i don't know.. its on my laptop.. but i read it somewhere, and it worked fine when i tried it.
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	and widescreen resolutions also work fine?
2009-05-11T03:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	well, its not a widescreen laptop, so i've never tried them
2009-05-11T03:32:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	^_^
2009-05-11T03:34:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	the only intel related update is: xserver-xorg-video-intel... i don't see how that can fix something at boot...
2009-05-11T03:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	all i know, is when i updated, it worked fine.. but as i said earlier, i use 32bit, not 65
2009-05-11T03:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		*64
2009-05-11T03:35:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	oke. gonna take the gamble and update :P
2009-05-11T03:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	get your fire extinguisher.. ;)
2009-05-11T03:36:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	yea, i will need it to cool me down when this breaks my boot resulting in a reinstall :P
2009-05-11T03:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	lol, like i said, it worked fine on 32bit.. not sure how it would go on 64
2009-05-11T03:37:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	updating now. Where did you set the resolution? in menu.lst or in the modues file where intelfb is loaded
2009-05-11T03:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	again, i don't use widescreen, but when I went to sys/pref/display, my preferred res was there
2009-05-11T03:38:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	oke. thanx so far,
2009-05-11T03:39:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	rebooting now.
2009-05-11T03:42:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	nope.. still the AGP error.
2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	markg85	can't offer any suggestions.. try ubuntuforums maybe... i know 9.04 32bit had some issues w/ the intel driver, maybe 64 does as well, adn it has not been resolved yet
2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	markg85	IndyGunFreak	oke, no problem. Thanx for you help anyway
