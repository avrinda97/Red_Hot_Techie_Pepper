2005-04-17T08:46:00.000Z	yahalom		anyone using the Enlightenment desktop?
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z	yahalom		is it recommended or not really?
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	its doesn't have anywhere near the number of developers as kde/gnome. which translates into very few releases.. not many users.
2005-04-17T08:51:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	.. 12 months and you'll start seeing more eye candy become available.  XGL/Glitz/Cairo/Luminocity(Metacity really) are all working on providing it for us.
2005-04-17T08:53:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	what is eye candy? the plastic look, cos i dont dig that bru
2005-04-17T08:54:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	lemme find a url for you.
2005-04-17T08:54:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/xshots
2005-04-17T08:55:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	i installed and played around with luminocity .. pretty neat.. not really usable for daily computer use though
2005-04-17T08:56:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	appreciated
2005-04-17T08:56:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	that is pretty neat, but i can see that if i installed that on a company's pcs they would throw me out
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	speed is the essential part
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	its a test bed.. to should you what IS possible.. not what will be the default :)
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	as in.. if it can do that.. it'll beable to do 'xxxx'
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	well its cool. i never doubted that linux is capable of anything.
2005-04-17T08:58:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	does it dicrease speed?
2005-04-17T08:58:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	it uses your video cards GL rendering engine.. so no.
2005-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	but lemme repeat .. its all experimental :) .. i have installed and used it. and it does make stuff slower.. but thats just bugs in the code :)
2005-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	how long in ur opinion until its ready?
2005-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	the cairo/glitz/xgl stuff is neat as well.  i think the first distro you'll see it in will be novell's .. early next year.
2005-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	what suse?
2005-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	yeah or whatever they call it now.
2005-04-17T09:01:00.000Z	yahalom	hohlraum	lol, so ubuntu isnt going for that stuff?
2005-04-17T09:01:00.000Z	hohlraum	yahalom	www.osnews.com has various articles talking about it.
