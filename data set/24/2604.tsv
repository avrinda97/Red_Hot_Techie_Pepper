2008-10-26T21:18:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		i m having problem with youtube
2008-10-26T21:19:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		i cannot see the videos on it
2008-10-26T21:19:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		also when i tried to install flashplayer
2008-10-26T21:19:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		it give me error
2008-10-26T21:19:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		ERROR: Your architecture, \'x86_64\', is not supported by the
2008-10-26T21:19:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		       Adobe Flash Player installer.
2008-10-26T21:20:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn		i think its archetecture problem
2008-10-26T21:20:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	did you try apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree?
2008-10-26T21:20:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	: yes
2008-10-26T21:21:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	: its already install
2008-10-26T21:21:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	and so the problem is that you get a grey box?
2008-10-26T21:22:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	ok so you are trying to install flash on a 64 bit platform. unfortunately adobe does not support 64 bit (the bug that was filed is about 4 years old now)
2008-10-26T21:23:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	however there are ways around this
2008-10-26T21:23:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	tell
2008-10-26T21:24:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	ok so what i do for youtube is i have a greasemonkey script installed that replaces the flash player on youtube with either mplayer or totem. it works all the time instead of only sometimes and the fullscreen is much faster
2008-10-26T21:24:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	however i cannot seek in the middle of videos, but its a minor drawback. plus greasemonkey can be switched on an off very easily
2008-10-26T21:25:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25481
2008-10-26T21:26:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	also http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/22281 (this is the one i use, requires mplayer)
2008-10-26T21:26:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	i have install greasemonkey using firefox addons
2008-10-26T21:27:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	that is correct. install greasemonkey first, then install one of the scripts, which links i have provided
2008-10-26T21:36:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	i miss that
2008-10-26T21:38:00.000Z	capricorrrrrn	amrik	in firefox plugin there is long list
2008-10-26T21:39:00.000Z	amrik	capricorrrrrn	there should be a section for "shockwave flash"
