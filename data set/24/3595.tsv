2010-03-04T21:52:00.000Z	soreau	root_	I meant what command are you running in your terminal to get that message
2010-03-04T21:53:00.000Z	root_	soreau	i just type in sauerbratan, usualy it opens the game but it stopped after installing python soya
2010-03-04T21:54:00.000Z	soreau	root_	How did you install this python soya?
2010-03-04T21:54:00.000Z	root_	soreau	synaptic package manager
2010-03-04T21:54:00.000Z	soreau	root_	If you uninstall it and run apt-get autoremove, does it start working again?
2010-03-04T21:55:00.000Z	root_	soreau	uninstall python soya?
2010-03-04T21:57:00.000Z	root_	soreau	i uninstalled python soya and it still doesnt work, this happened before but i couldnt figure it out so i just reinstalled ubuntu
2010-03-04T22:00:00.000Z	root_	soreau	i uninstalled python soya and it still doesnt work, this happened before but i couldnt figure it out so i just reinstalled ubuntu
2010-03-04T22:02:00.000Z	soreau	root_	I don't know what python soya is or why it would break SDL..
2010-03-04T22:03:00.000Z	root_	soreau	its not only that, i installed the mana world and it did it also
2010-03-04T22:03:00.000Z	root_	soreau	but then i just got fed up and reinstalled ubuntu
2010-03-04T22:06:00.000Z	root_	soreau	but then i just got fed up and reinstalled ubuntu
2010-03-04T22:07:00.000Z	root_	soreau	its not only that, i installed the mana world and it did it also
2010-03-04T22:08:00.000Z	soreau	root_	That is strange.. not sure why these program would affect your sdl install
2010-03-04T22:09:00.000Z	soreau	root_	You can either file a bug report or, you could try and ask some sdl dev why it breaks like this
2010-03-04T22:09:00.000Z	root_	soreau	i looked all over the internet and there are a bunch of people who already asked but noone gave any answers yet
2011-04-01T21:31:00.000Z	soreau	root_	But we don't support backtrack at all here
2011-04-01T21:31:00.000Z	root_	soreau	it's the same in all distros
