2010-11-21T01:28:00.000Z	Chiwauwa		Any recommendation regarding the mounting of the NFS share during startup?
2010-11-21T01:28:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	add it to Fstab
2010-11-21T01:29:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Are you familiar with fstab? If so, it's pretty simple.
2010-11-21T01:29:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	I have it in fstab ... but it gives me a 'xyz is not ready yet' and then it is available when I log in.
2010-11-21T01:30:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	I believe that it is a race condition.
2010-11-21T01:30:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Hmm. That's odd. I have several NFS mounts, never seen that.
2010-11-21T01:32:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	I've spent the last 3 hours on this :-s It seems to be a relatively common issue. Only hint I could find was autofs
2010-11-21T01:32:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Lemme paste you my fstab entry...
2010-11-21T01:32:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	192.168.1.4:/root/sdb1 /home/canthus13/Bob/sdb1 nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr,auto
2010-11-21T01:34:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	looks similar to mine ... 2 sec and I'll post mine
2010-11-21T01:37:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	192.168.0.7:/volume1/RecordedTV  /var/lib/mythtv/recordings/nas  nfs   soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
2010-11-21T01:37:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Add timeo=14 and see how that affects it.
2010-11-21T01:38:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	just at the end or does it has to be in a specific order?
2010-11-21T01:38:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	The end should suffice.
2010-11-21T01:40:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	...Are you mounting over wireless by any chance?
2010-11-21T01:41:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	yes, right now I am
2010-11-21T01:41:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	but it is not wireless from the machine that mounts
2010-11-21T01:41:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	depending on your network conditions, you might need to up that 14 some more. the value is in tenths of a second.
2010-11-21T01:42:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	still a problem with 14.
2010-11-21T01:42:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Hrm...
2010-11-21T01:43:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	I'll try to increase it. The two machines will be connected via GBit when I have the system ready but right now they are connected via Sonos units
2010-11-21T01:45:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	trying now with 50
2010-11-21T01:46:00.000Z	Chiwauwa	canthus13	thank you ... but it is still 'angry' at me and stops with a dialog during boot up. I doubt this is going to solve the issue.
2010-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	canthus13	Chiwauwa	Good to know.
