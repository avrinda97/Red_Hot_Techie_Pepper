2007-10-01T11:45:00.000Z	esteth		How do i remove applications from my list of apps that load at startup from a CLI?
2007-10-01T11:46:00.000Z	esteth		How do i change the "start this stuff at startup" list from a terminal?
2007-10-01T11:46:00.000Z	eck	esteth	there are a couple of tools, i like rcconf
2007-10-01T11:48:00.000Z	esteth	eck	I ran that, but i don't see compiz-fusion on that list, which i have in my list in the "sessions" applet in GNOME
2007-10-01T11:51:00.000Z	eck	esteth	that's because compiz fusion is run at login, not at bootup
2007-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	esteth	eck	So how do i change things that run on logon?
2007-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	eck	esteth	you want to do it non-graphically? it's a gconf setting
2007-10-01T11:54:00.000Z	eck	esteth	they're just a bunch of xml files
2007-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	esteth	eck	Right, so where would i find the xml files? I just get a white screen and stuff when i start up into x :S
2007-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	eck	esteth	~/.gconf
2007-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	esteth	eck	thanks
2007-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	eck	esteth	if you backup/remove ~/.gconf ~/.local and ~/.gnome* you should pretty much be able to login with a completely default gnome session
2007-10-01T11:59:00.000Z	esteth	eck	Thanks. I just tried logging in to "failsafe GNOME" session, but even that gives the same result. a grey box in the top left corner that reveals itself to be an error message after some time, then a white screen where i can semi-interact with menu bars, allthough all the graphics are messed up.
2007-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	eck	esteth	have you looked at ~/.xsession-errors?
2007-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	esteth	eck	no, i'll take a look just now
2007-10-01T12:02:00.000Z	esteth	eck	Theres a few lines in there, but none of them look like errors :S. it seems like a graphics issue, since it only appeared after i attempted to run a game through wine in fullscreen over dual monitors which arn't the same size. Even when i change xorg.conf to use 'nv' instead of 'nvidia' though, the same problem occurs :S
2007-10-01T12:03:00.000Z	eck	esteth	and you've restarted X?
2007-10-01T12:03:00.000Z	eck	esteth	you could also look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-10-01T12:03:00.000Z	esteth	eck	many times. Not tried a reboot yet, but it doesn't seem like that will solve the problem
2007-10-01T12:03:00.000Z	eck	esteth	did you just log out or actually restart gdm?
2007-10-01T12:04:00.000Z	esteth	eck	i did a ctrl-alt-backspace
2007-10-01T12:04:00.000Z	esteth	eck	how do i restart gdm?
2007-10-01T12:04:00.000Z	eck	esteth	ok, that is fine
2007-10-01T12:06:00.000Z	esteth	eck	I just tried changing some stuff, and now i think i have to reboot. I'll be back in 5 or 10 minuites if it's not working
