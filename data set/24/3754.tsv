2007-12-28T06:30:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	can you paste the output of iwconfig to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and paste the link for your pastebin back here?
2007-12-28T06:34:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	ok, looking
2007-12-28T06:35:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	hmm, kinda sparse. what is the output from lspci | grep -i network
2007-12-28T06:36:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	ok, looking
2007-12-28T06:37:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	ok, the system is recognizing it, so that is good
2007-12-28T06:43:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	hmm, kinda sparse. what is the output from grep -i eth[01] /var/log/syslog
2007-12-28T06:43:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	what is that?
2007-12-28T06:44:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	yes, you need to do that. I have the same card, and it started right up with restricted driver
2007-12-28T06:45:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	good luck
2007-12-28T06:48:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	did you go to system->administration->restricted drivers manager?
2007-12-28T06:48:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	and was the intel driver enabled?
2007-12-28T06:49:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	hmm
2007-12-28T06:49:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	is iwconfig showing any wireless cards now?
2007-12-28T06:51:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	do you have both a wireless card and a wired connection?
2007-12-28T06:53:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	your iwconfig that you pasted earlier showed only two interfaces lo which is the loopback, and eth0. I'm curious if eth0 is your wireless card or if it is your normal ethernet card
2007-12-28T06:53:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	btw, you english is fine. there is a spanish channel if you want to seek help there, #ubuntu-es
2007-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	ok, so iwconfig isn't seeing your wireless card at all.
2007-12-28T06:54:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	does another interface show up if you type ifconfig?
2007-12-28T06:55:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	hmm
2007-12-28T06:57:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	can you paste the output of this command? dmesg | grep ipw3945
2007-12-28T07:00:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	ah, there is a switch somewhere on your laptop that turns wireless card on and off, i think it is set to off right now, can you check?
2007-12-28T07:04:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	hurray!
2007-12-28T07:05:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	so you may need to reboot with it on to get it going
2007-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	robdig	pedrotmartinez	np
