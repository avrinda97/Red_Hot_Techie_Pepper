2009-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	somedud3		how do i scan a disk to find / try to repair bad sectors ?
2009-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	boot into the recover kernel and there will be an option listed
2009-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	i am on a live USB right now
2009-04-17T09:40:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	can i use that on an empty FS ?
2009-04-17T09:41:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	if it hasn't been partitioned and formatted probably not
2009-04-17T09:41:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	im having trouble parititoning, thats why i want to run a disk check
2009-04-17T09:41:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	are you attempting a dual boot?
2009-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	yeah, i have done it on this drive before, but for some reason i cant create more than 2 partitions
2009-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	ah.. you can only have 4 primary partitions on a drive.. if you're currently at 2 or 3 then the next needs to be an extended partition of the entire remaining amount.. then that space can be partitioned several times.
2009-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	yeah i know, i made my xp part, 1 for linux swap, trying to add the ext3 partition but it wont let me
2009-04-17T09:45:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	are you using the partition manager built into the live cd?
2009-04-17T09:45:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	gparted , yeah
2009-04-17T09:46:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	what's it say?
2009-04-17T09:51:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	it says /dev/sda5: No such file or directory
2009-04-17T09:51:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	that would be the reference for the 5th partition..
2009-04-17T09:51:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	right the 3rd partition i added is an extended
2009-04-17T09:52:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	i have 2 ntfs primaries, then third is extended, then adding a linux swap and error occurs
2009-04-17T09:54:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	you've added the extended but have you hit "apply" in gparted after creating it? it might not allow creation of any partitions in the extended portion until that partition is written correctly.
2009-04-17T09:54:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	yeah it applied fine, but after that i cant add anything in the unallocated space under the extended part
2009-04-17T09:55:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	have you tried restarting the live cd and system to see if that makes a difference?
2009-04-17T09:55:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	no guess i should try that
2009-04-17T09:55:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	worth a shot
2009-04-17T09:57:00.000Z	somedud3	scunizi	but basically after i try to apply it gives that error ( no such directory),  and shows there is an 'unknown partition' there, and if i try to format that partition i get the same error
2009-04-17T09:57:00.000Z	scunizi	somedud3	that after hitting "new" to create a new partition?
