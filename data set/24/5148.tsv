2006-11-06T06:24:00.000Z	nanotube		recently we have switched couple workstations in the office from windows to ubuntu linux. Some users have really problem weth this environment and I'm just wondering if anyone can recommend in documentation for simple users..? NOT for admin
2006-11-06T06:24:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	i hope you're using Gnome ubuntu, right?
2006-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	yes gnome
2006-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	does Main Menu > System > Help do anything?
2006-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	Dapper or Edgy?
2006-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	I need somethink which is not for IT people
2006-11-06T06:25:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	dapper
2006-11-06T06:27:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	they've expressed a lack of understanding with the provided help files/
2006-11-06T06:27:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	yep...I'll look at that... thanks
2006-11-06T06:28:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	otherwise another good bet might be setting aside a day for training
2006-11-06T06:30:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	we have already buy a book to see if that will work but all books ara more for linux users which have experiance with OSs. We need somethink about creating directories files, navigating email
2006-11-06T06:31:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	training is also good option ...
2006-11-06T06:31:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	wikibooks.org has "Linux for Newbies"
2006-11-06T06:33:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	this is not going to be an easy task. however, you should just have to point them to Gnome's docs, there's a Help > Contents menu item in most Gnome programs
2006-11-06T06:34:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	Nautilus handles creating directories, etc..., the program they use handles creating files, the rest is just telling them what programs to use for what purposes
2006-11-06T06:36:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	what I find out is: If user did not have experiance with PC's before and windows they do not complain and thay learn quicly how ever the other employees which have been using windows for many years that complain and are not wiling to learn just that easy that I point them to doc files:-)
2006-11-06T06:38:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	i completely sympathize, i just installed edgy on a friend's computer yesterday. he'll be all over me for advice for the next few months... computer users get frightened when they dont know what to do, and fear makes people angry... at you
2006-11-06T06:39:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	anger and frustration !! Nothing is working !!! that's what they say !!! :-)
2006-11-06T06:41:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	just imagine if you installed OS X, even more radically different from windows
2006-11-06T06:43:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	I have a problem with OS X :-)) I'm more keen to command line approach !!! But thats only me these days..
2006-11-06T06:46:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	for example this: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html there is nothing what I can give to our employyes to read..:-(
2006-11-06T06:48:00.000Z	preaction	nanotube	yeah, that's what the internal help files look like. um... might just be best to give some training and tell them to understand that learning won't come overnight. how long did it take them to learn windows?
2006-11-06T06:51:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	I'm big fan of windows2linux switch but with this documentation we never manage to switch ordinary pc users to linux
2006-11-06T06:53:00.000Z	nanotube	preaction	ok dude...I need to go..thanks for a help...have a great day !!
