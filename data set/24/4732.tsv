2007-02-12T10:12:00.000Z	stochastic		hey room, does anyone know where the icon files in ubuntu's main menu are located?
2007-02-12T10:13:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	I bet this is what youre looking for http://www.violet-rain.info/distributorlogo.html
2007-02-12T10:15:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I don't think that's what I was looking for, I'm trying to replace the icons next to Internet, Applications, etc... in the main menu
2007-02-12T10:16:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	ahh
2007-02-12T10:16:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	see http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=359280
2007-02-12T10:17:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	you can change those using the menu editor, just right click
2007-02-12T10:18:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I'm trying to package an icon set so that others can install it in the themes menu
2007-02-12T10:18:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I need to find the location/name of the files but even the ones in the menu editor aren't right in some cases
2007-02-12T10:19:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	I bet theyre somewhere in /usr/share/icons
2007-02-12T10:19:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I've been searching in there
2007-02-12T10:19:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	mine are in /usr/share/icons/gnome/24x24
2007-02-12T10:20:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	at least the accessories one is, thats the only one I checked
2007-02-12T10:20:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	yeah, I've been able to switch most of them but the Internet is proving very elusive
2007-02-12T10:21:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	mine is in /usr/share/icons/gnome/24x24/categories
2007-02-12T10:21:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I've changed that file but it still loads up with the old icon
2007-02-12T10:22:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	why dont you just change the menu so it points to the icon you want?
2007-02-12T10:22:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	because I'm trying to get an icon theme set that others can install
2007-02-12T10:23:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	if it was just for myself I'd simply point the menu to the right file but I need to follow standards
2007-02-12T10:23:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	I understand, not sure why you would have trouble with that one in particular.
2007-02-12T10:47:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	just to let you know I've solved my problem with the icon, looks like one of the resolution sizes hadn't been changed yet
2007-02-12T10:48:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	ah. So youre gonna upload an icon theme to gnome-look or something?
2007-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	I've got a little more to do to the theme before it's ready for upload
2007-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	shatrat	stochastic	well, good luck!
2007-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	stochastic	shatrat	thanks
