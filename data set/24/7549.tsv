2006-05-30T12:25:00.000Z	Some_Person		Shouldn't it already be configured? LILO is the last thing to install from the CD.
2006-05-30T12:26:00.000Z	Some_Person		I need the Windows MBR.
2006-05-30T12:26:00.000Z	Some_Person		And I can't get GRUB to install at all.

2006-05-30T12:27:00.000Z	Some_Person		I have it set to ask me for one second for Ubunty or Windows XP.

2006-05-30T12:28:00.000Z	Some_Person		My dad has Non-MS-OS'sPhoebia
2006-05-30T12:28:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	perhaps he'd like plan 9...
2006-05-30T12:29:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	odd numbers of partitions are better
2006-05-30T12:29:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	I was joking
2006-05-31T16:19:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	use the linuxant driver free @ 14.4 ;)
2006-05-31T16:20:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	reverse engineer the 'registration code' or whatever?
2006-05-31T16:21:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	it's probably just a good guy/bad guy jz or jnz, you just have to find it and flip it ;)
2006-05-31T16:21:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	no
2006-05-31T16:22:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	that's nothing to with linux, just x86 asm
2006-05-31T16:23:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	somewhere, when you enter yr code, there's a check, is the code good or not - if you're lucky it'll be done the stupidest way, and the real code will be strcmp'd with what you entered, and you can read the real code out of memory, but I doubt it
2006-05-31T16:24:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	I've told you how to do it ;)
2006-05-31T16:25:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	yes - you pay them, and they give it to you
2006-05-31T16:25:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	it works quite well, swsusp doesn't like the driver much, but otherwise it's ok
2006-05-31T16:27:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	it's not very expensive
2006-05-31T11:53:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	you can set up a button on gkrellm to do it, probably others
2006-05-31T11:59:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	killall pppd should do it ;)
2006-05-31T11:59:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	or poff, that's what I use
2006-05-31T12:01:00.000Z	amphi	Some_Person	I used pppconfig, so I just do pon foo & poff
