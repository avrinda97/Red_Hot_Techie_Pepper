2012-06-22T20:54:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	ffmpegthumbnailer yeah lil hard to use i was trying to install thumbnail me but wont install
2012-06-22T21:05:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	where did you get thumbnail package? can't find it in ubuntu 12.04 .. also wondering if you're looking for a standalone thumbnailer or to get it with nautilus or any other file manager you use
2012-06-22T21:08:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	i got it from here http://www.thumbnailme.com/ its not in ubuntu 12.04 download it its a deb

2012-06-22T21:11:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	ok thanks
2012-06-22T21:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	i tested the 64bit version, installed ok here (and it works) .. did you get any error messages while installing? and you have the correct .deb for your system (32bit or 64bit)?
2012-06-22T21:20:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	i useing ubuntu 12.04 64bits let me see if am useing the correct .deb
2012-06-22T21:22:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	no i am useing the i386 deb lol were did you find the 64bit one
2012-06-22T21:23:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	heh, it's on the site, you need to click the x64 folder
2012-06-22T21:24:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	will check right now
2012-06-22T21:25:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	http://netcologne.dl.sourceforge.net/project/thumbnailme/Linux/Debian/x64/Thumbnailme_2.1_amd64.deb in case you missed it (i have seriously customized my browser, so i might have another 'view' on that page as yourself)
2012-06-22T21:43:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	its not working for me caues the i386 is install but not working am now i cant install the 64 bits one how would i remove the i386 one useing terminal
2012-06-22T21:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	'sudo apt-get purge thumbnailme' to get rid of the i386 one and 'sudo dpkg -i <path/to/64bit.deb>' to try with the 64bit
2012-06-22T21:45:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	that to remove program or install program i need to remove
2012-06-22T21:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	you double-clicked when installing the first time i guess, it's easier to see any installation problems from commandline with that second one
2012-06-22T21:49:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	am getting this here
2012-06-22T21:50:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	take it from the top ... first: sudo apt-get purge thumbnailme
2012-06-22T21:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	no worries, let us know when you are ready to install the 64bit version .. it's crucial in this step to feed the command with the exact path of Thumbnailme_2.1_amd64.deb, otherwise it will not find it .. that's the logic
2012-06-22T21:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	ok, as example .. 'sudo dpkg -i $HOME/Desktop/Thumbnailme_2.1_amd64.deb' will try to install it if you downloaded it to ~/Desktop .. the $HOME is a shortcut to your home/<username> ..
2012-06-22T21:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	do you know where you downloaded it?
2012-06-22T22:25:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	did you install useing deb install software
2012-06-22T22:26:00.000Z	glitsj16	oldschool	thumbnailme? yes i tried the .deb .. still having issues?
2012-06-22T22:37:00.000Z	oldschool	glitsj16	got it install and everything working fine now thanks for your help
