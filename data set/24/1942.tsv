2010-02-01T18:35:00.000Z	om26er	suman	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-02-01T18:37:00.000Z	suman	om26er	 ubuntu 9.10
2010-02-01T18:37:00.000Z	suman	om26er	i installed 8.10 then upgraded to 9.04 and then to 9.10

2010-02-01T18:41:00.000Z	suman	om26er	one more query I have is, when I installed UBUNTU I did not care to go for the partition, but now when this is installed can I get some feature like disk compression so that i can partition the disk without losing current installation
2010-02-01T18:41:00.000Z	om26er	suman	you can do resizing of partition without compressing
2010-02-01T18:42:00.000Z	om26er	suman	you have to run live cd of ubuntu and use gparted in live session to resize partition
2010-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	suman	om26er	does this have any specific thing that i should remember or the automatic guide is enough
2010-02-01T18:43:00.000Z	suman	om26er	and i have ubuntu 8.10 live cd
2010-02-01T18:44:00.000Z	om26er	suman	when resizing everything you have to do manually
2010-02-01T18:45:00.000Z	suman	om26er	thanx i will try this in some time
2010-02-01T18:45:00.000Z	om26er	suman	np :)
2010-02-01T23:09:00.000Z	suman	om26er	i am srry abt the last time can this be some virus as there are other activities
2010-02-01T23:10:00.000Z	om26er	suman	ubuntu == no virus
