2011-07-19T01:33:00.000Z	edbian	edasdsadsa	Unfortunately that's the intended behavior.  I am not aware of any way to change it.  I think you'd have to edit the source yourself (not easy at all) or contact the developers.
2011-07-19T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	edasdsadsa	Maybe make an Ubuntu brainstorm:  http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/
