2005-09-18T16:12:00.000Z	bob2		here...
2005-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	bob2		no
2005-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	bob2		security for ubuntu only happens for things in the "main" section
2005-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	bob2		sid gets very timely security updates
2005-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	bob2		generally
2005-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	bob2		if you want up to date stuff, ubuntu is not for you, either
2005-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	bob2		since that means running ubuntu's development branch, which is often more broken than sid
2005-09-18T16:16:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	let's take kde 3.4 for example
2005-09-18T16:16:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	which is in sid, no?
2005-09-18T16:17:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	yes. problem is, i also want to use kbiff, which i can't install because there's no version in sid iirc, and it depends on an old kde lib that conflicts with the new one from sid
2005-09-18T16:17:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	right, known bug
2005-09-18T16:17:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	well, the other alternative would be a commercial distro
2005-09-18T16:17:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	you can trivially fix it yourself, or wait
2005-09-18T16:18:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	fixing = apt-get source -b kbdiff ; sudo dpkg -i kbiff*.deb
2005-09-18T16:18:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	no, if you're going to use sid, you just deal with trivial bugs like that
2005-09-18T16:18:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	or you even find someone to upload it to sid for you, so it's fixed for everyone
2005-09-18T16:19:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	or upload to sid myself, eh? =)
2005-09-18T16:19:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	exactly!
2005-09-18T16:19:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	that's a very debianish attitude =)
2005-09-18T16:20:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	know any good commercial distros? if they're rpm based, but supply something like aptitude, i could warm up for that
2005-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	bob2	adaran	nah, I hate the idea of not being able to fix my distro :)
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	i tried the kbiff thing too
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	adaran	bob2	16 packages upgraded, 55 newly installed just to get the development files =)
