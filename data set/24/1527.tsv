2009-11-28T20:36:00.000Z	GhotiPhud		I'm trying to make an iso of a dvd, but the dd command keeps stopping with an input/output error but the disk works fine.  What can I do to fix this?
2009-11-28T20:37:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	can you list your commandline exactly?
2009-11-28T20:37:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	and the error, exactly?

2009-11-28T20:40:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	did you see epinky 's suggestion above?
2009-11-28T20:45:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	hmm.. from googling, i wonder if it might be an encrypted DVD
2009-11-28T20:48:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	if you burn a DVD of plain data, can you read it with dd? that would rule out drive issues
2009-11-28T20:49:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	I tried this on a DVD and on an audio CD that I had burned myself
2009-11-28T20:49:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	same result both times
2009-11-28T20:50:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	do those disks work properly in another machine? (ie are they known good burns?)
2009-11-28T20:50:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	yes, they work in another laptop and in a dvd player
2009-11-28T20:54:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	so.... can you read any DVDs or CDROMs at all on this machine?
2009-11-28T20:54:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	In linux or windows?
2009-11-28T20:57:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	I am able to copy this disk with k3b...
2009-11-28T20:58:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	i would do a google for dd encyrption dvd
2009-11-28T20:58:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	apparently some DVDs encrypt using unusual methods that confuse dd
2009-11-28T20:59:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	the thing that has me stumped is that I was just trying to make an iso of an audio cd that I burned.  I only used the DVD after that failed
2009-11-28T21:00:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	oh yeah. hrm.... this is a long shot, what if you use dd using different block sizes, like dd bs=128k
2009-11-28T21:01:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	I'll try that
2009-11-28T21:02:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	wow, changing the block size seems to fix it... odd
2009-11-28T21:02:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	i think audio CDs might also confuse dd though... i dont have a cdrom or dvdrom so i am sorry i cannot help you any further
2009-11-28T21:03:00.000Z	GhotiPhud	decora	you've been a great help, thanks
2009-11-28T21:03:00.000Z	decora	GhotiPhud	welcome
