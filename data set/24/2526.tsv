2009-12-20T05:03:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	have you modified your /etc/ssh/sshd_config in anyway?
2009-12-20T05:03:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	added ClientAliveTimeout
2009-12-20T05:04:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	did you change the port of the remote computer for ssh?
2009-12-20T05:05:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	yes; mgolisch: yes; losha: using putty
2009-12-20T05:05:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	so you would type ssh -v username@ip_address
2009-12-20T05:06:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	on the server yes, on the windows laptop I can't.
2009-12-20T05:07:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	how about going back to the server and setting the port in sshd_config back to port 22
2009-12-20T05:07:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	I'd rather not.  It's running *again* on local... for now.
2009-12-20T05:08:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	your choosing a method of obscurity, which doesn't solve your problem, it doesn't make hiding the port any secure, that is where you'd want to have correct firewall (possibly using iptables or ufw) to protect that machine
2009-12-20T05:09:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	are you using portmapd?
2009-12-20T05:09:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	don't know.
2009-12-20T05:11:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	I keep getting STUPID timeout errors!
2009-12-20T05:11:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	did you change the gracetime values on the server hosting the ssh?
2009-12-20T05:12:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	how?  Will this affect pre-login timeouts?
2009-12-20T05:12:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	gracetime values if set to short you will only have a certain amount of time to enter a password before it rejects you, the usual time out is 120seconds
2009-12-20T05:13:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	this will not solve my pre-login timeout errors
2009-12-20T05:13:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	your using security by obscurity, if one wanted, you are only making it harder but an nmap scan could easily detect listening ports
2009-12-20T05:14:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	are you able to ssh to anther machine using that same putty computer?
2009-12-20T05:14:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	anyway.  This is pre-login.
2009-12-20T05:14:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	yes Internet server
2009-12-20T05:14:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	but not my local server with pre-login timeouts
2009-12-20T05:16:00.000Z	LetsGo67	nossralsuva	and you have an ssh server with no problems?
2009-12-20T05:16:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	can you go into a private chat, i will give you my heavily modified ssh config file
2009-12-20T05:16:00.000Z	nossralsuva	LetsGo67	so that you could do a comparison
