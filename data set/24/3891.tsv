2008-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	Fink		hmmm
2008-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	Fink		just did "sudo nautilus" again
2008-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	Fink		and it said "fink is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported"
2008-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	Fink		fink == me
2008-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	Fink		but sudo anything does the same
2008-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	Fink		no
2008-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	root and nautilus - quick route to broken box
2008-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	Fink		i mean gives me the error "fink is not in the sudoers file..."
2008-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	so here is a clue - you are not the first user who installed the box become that user if you want to progress
2008-03-03T01:27:00.000Z	Fink		i am in the first user i made when i installed it >_<
2008-03-03T01:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	do this command here >> id << and tell me what you see
2008-03-03T01:30:00.000Z	Fink		uid=1000(fink) gid=1000(fink) groups=60(games),1000(fink)
2008-03-03T01:31:00.000Z	Fink		could this be the doing of my recent "sudo usermod -G games fink"
2008-03-03T01:31:00.000Z	Fink		>_<
2008-03-03T01:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	well done you borked your box
2008-03-03T01:31:00.000Z	Fink		hurm
2008-03-03T01:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	not all is lost if you have a live CD
2008-03-03T01:32:00.000Z	Fink		good thing this is a fresh install :D
2008-03-03T01:32:00.000Z	Fink	ompaul	which i does
2008-03-03T01:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Fink	so fire it up and join here again - - mind you, if you did other stuff at the same time then perhaps a fresh and clean isntall is a good idea
