2007-07-10T08:30:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	Ah... that makes sense too.. :)
2007-07-10T08:31:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	but still i dont understand what that "." do
2007-07-10T08:20:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	sudo pico /etc/environment     ? I'm not sure if thats what you're asking
2007-07-10T08:21:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	i edited the file, now i want to make the changes effective, how can i do it?
2007-07-10T08:22:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	If anything, you'd have to log out/log back in
2007-07-10T08:22:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	i believe i can do it without logout, i hate logout :(
2007-07-10T08:22:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	I'm not sure then.
2007-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	:( i will do a reboot then
2007-07-10T08:28:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	found it, you can use . /etc/environment
2007-07-10T08:31:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	it just runs /etc/environment as if it was a script
2007-07-10T08:32:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	but the /etc/environment doesnt have +x mode
2007-07-10T08:33:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	running the script in console looks fine, but it doesnt work for update manager, update manager still use the old environment
2007-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	I just did an experiment.  It seems it runs each line of the file as if it was a bash command...
2007-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	where can i find manual for "."? i do "man ." but no manual
2007-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	It might be in the bash manpage
2007-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	if i do "man bash" how can i skip to "." section?
2007-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	i accidentally skipp to the "." section, and found that "." and "source" are identic
2007-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	interesting
2009-06-23T20:56:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	it doesnt work

2009-06-23T20:56:00.000Z	gbw	Pici	scs.msg.yahoo.com doesnt work
2009-06-23T20:56:00.000Z	Pici	gbw	Thats not what ubottu suggested to use.
