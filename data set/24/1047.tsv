2010-08-20T02:56:00.000Z	alecstory		Hi, I'm running Lucid on an eeePC 1000, and I can't seem to get nm-applet to authenticate with a WPA2 protected wireless network.  What steps can I take to troubleshoot?
2010-08-20T02:56:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	got any error msg? checked dmesg? var/log/messages?
2010-08-20T02:57:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	I'm not sure how to check that, but I'll look in v/l/m
2010-08-20T02:58:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	just open with less and jump to the end, see if there's anything suspicious there. same with dmesg | less
2010-08-20T02:58:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	kk, will do
2010-08-20T03:00:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	http://paste.ubuntu.com/480648/
2010-08-20T03:02:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	doesnt look too odd. didi it work before? on another OS/distro/version? what hardware you got? what happens when you try to connect?
2010-08-20T03:03:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	I just resuscitated this laptop, but WPA worked back in June
2010-08-20T03:03:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	so - what happens when you try to connect?
2010-08-20T03:04:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	it tries and tries and tries and then spits me back to a password prompt.  I've re-typed the password, and copy-pasted it from the router's config, so I'm pretty confident
2010-08-20T03:04:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	does the network manager *see* your wifi net?
2010-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	yes, sorry if I'm being unclear
2010-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	what router you got?
2010-08-20T03:05:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	Belkin Wireless N, it works with other peoples' mac and windows computers
2010-08-20T03:08:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	MAC filter on the router?
2010-08-20T03:09:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	sorry, missed that last one, saw it as I hit quit
2010-08-20T03:29:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	don't think so.  I'm not going to be able to get to another network soon, sadly
2010-08-20T03:30:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	if all else fails you could give wireshark a shot and see what's what... that's voodoo then, tho
2010-08-20T03:33:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	 wireshark?
2010-08-20T03:33:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	if you never heard of it, you don't wanna go there, really :)
2010-08-20T03:34:00.000Z	alecstory	DexterF	so where else should I take my problem?
2010-08-20T03:35:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	well.. next steps are ruling out culprits. so: test eee on another wifi, if that's succesful check out the router. if you have access to it try temporarily disabling encryption and other security measures
2010-08-20T03:36:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	maybe the folks from aircrack-ng can help, they have a channel here. they're surprisingly friendly towards "normal" people :D
2010-08-20T03:37:00.000Z	DexterF	alecstory	then again - install wireshark, run as root and see if you can make somethign useful of it. perhaps googling specific functions helps.
