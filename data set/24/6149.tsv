2006-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		and that will fix the network problems too?
2006-02-27T08:16:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		yeah
2006-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		ah
2006-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		see...here's how this all started, fyi....
2006-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		i recently installed Slackware 10.2 on another drive. after the install, i wanted to listen to some music...but my music is stored on the drive holding ubuntu
2006-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		so i didn't have permission to view it
2006-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		so i did a chown -R on that drive
2006-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		yeah
2006-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		i did...but i was stupid and feeling lazy
2006-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		so i did chown -R TuxOtaku /mnt
2006-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	look at the group that owns the music you want to play; add that group to yourself
2006-02-27T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	the names are nice, but the numbers associated with those names are what matters
2006-02-27T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	ls /etc/group and ls /etc/passwd, those are the numbers that matter
2006-02-27T08:24:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	you need to match the user numbers to the names in *each* operating system
2006-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	screwed, if true
2006-02-27T08:27:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	if it's just the music you've screwed with, it's not tragic
2006-02-27T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	please, ohh, too late :)
2006-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	you are extremely unusual then
2006-02-27T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	I ran a debian unstable for years; I have yet to keep an ubuntu stable for more than 5 months
2006-02-27T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	just a data point, no real value
2006-02-27T08:34:00.000Z	TuxOtaku	nickrud	??
2006-02-27T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	a suggestion:
2006-02-27T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	create a group that exists (by number) in both slack and ubuntu, and make your music belong to that group:
2006-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	TuxOtaku	sorry it took so long for that to percolate to my forebrain
