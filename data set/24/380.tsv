2012-04-13T22:16:00.000Z	mneptok	fellayaboy	well, if you want an ssh server, install the package. if it's already installed, the package manager will tell you

2012-04-13T22:19:00.000Z	mneptok	fellayaboy	you should open the file as the root user in a text editor, and look through it and learn the settings. you'll see everything you want to know about keys and passphrases.
