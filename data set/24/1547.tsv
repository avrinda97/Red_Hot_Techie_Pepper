2010-01-27T19:47:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C		I know that lenswipe
2010-01-27T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	it should be clear by now that it is a troll.
2010-01-27T19:48:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	I was about to say something to the effect of "ubuntu troll is trolling"
2010-01-27T20:19:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	you can use ntldr to boot ubuntu.
2010-01-27T20:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	by chainloading grub (the same techinique that grub uses to boot NT it chainloads ntldr )
2010-01-27T20:20:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	you have me. I stopped that whole windows gambit a while ago.
2010-02-03T22:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	morning to you ; afternoon here ;)
2010-02-03T22:46:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	I hope you're having a very delightful evening. I'm hopping on to get my supporting fix :)
2010-02-03T23:43:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	remember he's trying to fix grub2
2010-02-13T04:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	the problem is with grub. it does not have a stage for everything :)
2010-02-13T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	yes; 32 has no problems at all. and the important bugfixes where backported to 31
2010-02-13T04:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	also use jfs for a while and talk about a carppy fs ;P
2010-02-13T04:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	no they can afford to hire ext2-3-4 developer Ted T'so ;)
2010-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	anytime a cluster goes down in google they have more ready that are set up. The only real problem was in the last year the load balance was focusing to a specific group of clusters overloading them and leaving others idle.
2010-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	Seveas they've got journal-less ext4 mode coded just for them (google used ext2 becouse of this)
2010-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	why would I want to use it without the journal? Silly..
2010-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	well if google do it there is food for thought
2010-03-09T19:05:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	isn't the best way to do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server ?
2010-03-09T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	that gives a practiacally empty xorg.conf this days afaik
2010-03-09T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	but yous you can do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg'
2010-03-09T19:06:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	what does that do? the -phigh.
2010-03-09T19:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	autodetect most things. (it will not ask anything)
2010-03-09T19:12:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	erUSUL	by default :)
2010-03-09T19:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	SpaceGhostC2C	right
