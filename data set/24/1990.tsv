2010-01-20T02:56:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	yes
2010-01-20T02:56:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	is there a prob in that?
2010-01-20T02:57:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	i dont think sudo is required with ls
2010-01-20T02:57:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	it may/may not cause harm
2010-01-20T02:57:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	i did not say so either
2010-01-20T02:57:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	it WILL NEVER do a harm!
2010-01-20T02:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	fyi, i'm a bit too advanced on linux
2010-01-20T02:58:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	well i am still not sure if sudo should be used with ls,but its your call
2010-01-20T02:59:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	you were supposed to read the whole thing before you comment
2010-01-20T02:59:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	sudo gives a normal user 'sudo
2010-01-20T02:59:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	sudo gives a normal user 'sudo' priviledges
2010-01-20T02:59:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	i know about elevation of priviliges
2010-01-20T03:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	well do you know about the safety of 'ls'?
2010-01-20T03:01:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	nope
2010-01-20T03:01:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	if you cannot 'cd' to a directory then you cannot know what's inside then 'ls dirname' may not even work
2010-01-20T03:02:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	yeah so?
2010-01-20T03:02:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	then 'sudo ls' will enable you to see whats inside
2010-01-20T03:02:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	im trying to see the history of the problem but cant find the original question
2010-01-20T03:04:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	ok, the other guy said his home directory is inaccessible and have tried chmod without any luck as a root. now thats strange, I then asked for 'ls' as a root
2010-01-20T03:05:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	ah ok then.. my bad
2010-01-20T03:05:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	just  curious, what makes you think that 'sudo ls' can be dangerous?
2010-01-20T03:06:00.000Z	shadeslayer	mkanyicy	its just a precaution i take with all commands,better be informed what your doing before prepending sudo :P
2010-01-20T03:07:00.000Z	mkanyicy	shadeslayer	ok, for starters. that's why sudo has the lecturing option
