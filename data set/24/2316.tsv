2009-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	vadi2		How can I run a script that uses sudo at gnome session start automatically, without asking for password the second time?
2009-03-03T07:26:00.000Z	vadi2		if lets say I just need to run script.sh at start to fix my webcam
2009-03-03T07:26:00.000Z	vadi2		sudo visudo script.sh ?
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	vadi2		oh, so I add that line to the file?
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	vadi2		and then do sudo script.sh?
2009-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	vadi2		I need to run this script auto without asking for password
2009-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: so you need it's time you plagg the webcam e?
2009-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: have you tried to search skype forums etc ?
2009-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: just asking
2009-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	yes, and I have it working... I just need to run this script as root now
2009-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	and it all works fine. But I'm unable to run it as root
2009-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: hmmm i ithink i know why
2009-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: i think you need to log in to a shell as a root
2009-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: not sudo command but su root and then type your root password
2009-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: and then you will be the real root user not fake sudoer one
2009-03-03T07:33:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	what do you mean
2009-03-03T07:34:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: so you need to make a link of the executable you use in the script to the usr/local/bin folder where there is not needed any root priveleges
2009-03-03T07:34:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	oh? thanks
2009-03-03T07:34:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: but this is sometimes not recomended for security reasons :-)
2009-03-03T07:34:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	Yeah understandable
2009-03-03T07:34:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: so keep in mind that :-)
2009-03-03T07:35:00.000Z	vadi2	AETE_KRAOUD	I don't care though, need to make this thing just work, until I buy a decent camera that Ubuntu supports (it half-supports this one)
2009-03-03T07:36:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: that's great if it does not work FINALLY COPY THE HALL FILE THERE AS A ROOT and give it the name you want and lastly make it chown yourname
2009-03-03T07:37:00.000Z	AETE_KRAOUD	vadi2	: good luck :-)
