2007-08-12T11:43:00.000Z	arooni		hey folks
2007-08-12T11:43:00.000Z	arooni		should i be running 64 bit version of ubuntu?
2007-08-12T11:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	no
2007-08-12T11:44:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	if you don't know why you need 64-bit ubuntu, you don't need it
2007-08-12T11:44:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	for extra fast performance?
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	just becuase the numbers are higher, doesn't mean it'll perform faster
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	the main benefit is if you have a lot of ram
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	like 4GB or over
2007-08-12T11:45:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	i just have 2gb
2007-08-12T12:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	which what video card?
2007-08-12T12:21:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	nvidia 7950 gtotc
2007-08-12T12:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	gtotc?
2007-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	not too sure on the last part... but its definitely 7950
2007-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	try using nvidia-settings
2007-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	i did but then it didnt detect my second monitor
2007-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	should i try resatrig
2007-08-12T12:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	are you using the nvidia driver?
2007-08-12T12:23:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	yes the fresh one downloaded from their site
2007-10-27T12:30:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	nfs is read/write
2007-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	so i can sync a file to my laptop, disconnect from network, then hook back up to the network and changes should be synced automatically?
2007-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	you cannot use nfs if you are disconnected from the server
2007-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	arooni	it's a simple read/write network filesystem
2007-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	arooni	dystopianray	ah ok
