2008-10-08T04:36:00.000Z	abe3k		hi guys, say I want to do a simple copy/paste task in nautilus but it requires root permission , isn't there any keyboard combination that'll let me enter the root password instead of going to the terminal and entering sudo ?

2008-10-08T04:40:00.000Z	abe3k		guys which room should I log into to get help about nautilus ?
2008-10-08T04:41:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	why are you trying to write to a folder owned by root?
2008-10-08T04:42:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag : I have openttd and theres a new version online that I've downloaded so I want to overwrite my older files in the /usr/share/games folder
2008-10-08T04:43:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	did you download and build the source, or did you get a package file?
2008-10-08T04:43:00.000Z	abe3k		arajag : I downloaded the binaries
2008-10-08T04:43:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	so you have a .deb file, or what?
2008-10-08T04:44:00.000Z	abe3k	bobertdos	: why is that ?
2008-10-08T04:44:00.000Z	Agrajag		Which package did you get?
2008-10-08T04:44:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag : no a zipped archive
2008-10-08T04:44:00.000Z	Agrajag		It's a pretty bad idea to go messing around with your /usr directory
2008-10-08T04:45:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	Can't you just run the program from your home directory, or remove openttd using the package manager and then istall what you have in /opt or /usr/local?
2008-10-08T04:46:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag : I can run it from my home folder but then I'll be having two version on my ubuntu , one old version which is installed and one unzipped version which I have to navigate to get to
2008-10-08T04:47:00.000Z	abe3k		arajag : I just want to overwrite my older files with ease
2008-10-08T04:47:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	so uninstall the one you have, and install the one you downloaded to /usr/local/games
2008-10-08T04:47:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag : ok how do I install ?
2008-10-08T04:47:00.000Z	Agrajag		/usr/local is for stuff not installed by the package manager
2008-10-08T04:47:00.000Z	Agrajag		I don't know, are there instuctions in the archive?
2008-10-08T04:48:00.000Z	Agrajag		a file named INSTALL or something similar?
2008-10-08T04:48:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag : its a zipped game , I just unzip it and run it, theres no install option
2008-10-08T04:48:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	there is a readme file
2008-10-08T04:49:00.000Z	abe3k		agrajag: but the one in the repositories installs an older version
2008-10-08T04:49:00.000Z	Agrajag	abe3k	so uninstall that one, extract this one to /usr/local/games/openttd, and make a symlink from the openttd binary there to /usr/bin/openttd
