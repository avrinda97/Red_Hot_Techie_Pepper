2009-01-25T22:32:00.000Z	boot_loop		Is there a web browser for Ubuntu/Linux that works similarly to IE when it comes to how a site is coded? Some web-apps work better in IE than in Mozilla, and I'm trying to find a Linux browser that works as well as IE does with these apps
2009-01-25T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	probably Firefox add ons for what you want, but Linux has quite a few other good browsers as well
2009-01-25T22:33:00.000Z	boot_loop	sebsebseb	what addon would you recommend for my situation? I am playing tetris which is flash (i believe), and it works, but it is very choppy in Firefox, but works perfectly in IE
2009-01-25T22:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	which version of IE?
2009-01-25T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	don't do that IE  for Linux thing that, the other guy suggested.  that's for web developers to test websites.  Also  you only get the old classic look of IE anyway
2009-01-25T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	the grey look
2009-01-25T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	no Linux or Mac versin of Chrome yet
2009-01-25T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	so  you just want a browser in Linux that works better with Flasho r?
2009-01-25T22:36:00.000Z	boot_loop	sebsebseb	essentially yes =)
2009-01-25T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	well  sudo apt-get install epiphany  sudo apt-get install galeon
2009-01-25T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	 they use Gecko to same rendering engine as Firefox etc.   Flash may work better in them, worth a try
2009-01-25T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	 they should pick up on the Mozilla Flash plugin no problem
2009-01-25T22:37:00.000Z	boot_loop	sebsebseb	thanks I'll give them a try
2009-01-25T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	also there's a way to get  Flash working in Konqueror which is a very nice browser
2009-01-25T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	 the  Free Software Foundations Gnash plugin is pretty good these days,  so if none of those browsers any good, you may want to try that.  sudo apt-get install Gnash
2009-01-25T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	that's an alternative to Adobes Flash
2009-01-25T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	 just like Swfdec is another one sudo apt-get swfdec  that's from the open source community.  again pretty good
2009-01-25T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	of course Adobes will still be better, but that's propritary, and an alternative may be rather fine or better for the Flash you want
2009-01-25T22:39:00.000Z	boot_loop	sebsebseb	do I have to uninstall flash to use gnash?
2009-01-25T22:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	yes
2009-01-25T22:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	as a last restor you could run a Windows  browser  with the Windows version of Flash, but that's a bit of a  nasty thing to do for various reasons
2009-01-25T22:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	hell you could even run Windows inside Ubuntu
2009-01-25T22:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	boot_loop	I meant wine for running the Windows browser, but  only as a last restort with a good reason in that case.   and then stick with the Linux browser the rest of the time of course
2009-05-07T04:29:00.000Z	boot_loop	sebsebseb	i know what lamp is, I have a server set up. I am having a problem I need to ask about
