2006-09-17T14:28:00.000Z	sasuke		does anyone know how to start a service in terminal?
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	which service?
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	sasuke	lyy	telnet
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	why use tellnet?
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	are you trying to connect to another system?
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	then yo0u need to install telnet server, do you have that?
2006-09-17T14:29:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	why wouuld you want telnet though? really, it's unsafe
2006-09-17T14:30:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	well if you got it installed..
2006-09-17T14:31:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	cd to /etc/init.d
2006-09-17T14:32:00.000Z	sasuke	lyy	its gone strangly, it was there last night
2006-09-17T14:32:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	what do you use telnet for again?
2006-09-17T14:33:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	just so you know, if you use tlenet, it's very easy for people to sniff your network traffic and get login names and passwords.
2006-09-17T14:34:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	it must be something very important to yhou to not use ssh and use only telnet
2006-09-17T14:35:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	try sudo telnetd
2006-09-17T14:35:00.000Z	sasuke	lyy	nope
2006-09-17T14:36:00.000Z	sasuke	lyy	none
2006-09-17T14:36:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	do a global find then: find / | grep -i telnet
2006-09-17T14:36:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	it might take a while though
2006-09-17T14:38:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	why do you want to try something that's backwards?
2006-09-17T14:38:00.000Z	sasuke	lyy	something diffrent.
2006-09-17T14:39:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	why? you sick of how well ssh works? :P
2006-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	so you're testing your forwarding skills ?
2006-09-17T14:45:00.000Z	lyy	sasuke	try /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
