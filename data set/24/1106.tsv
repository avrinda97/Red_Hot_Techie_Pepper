2010-07-23T03:51:00.000Z	Planetary		Does anyone know why a gateway pentium D computer will not run a live cd? I put a new cmos battery in it, changed cd drives, safe graphics mode, alterenate iso, usb boot, and both 64 and 32 bit installs. It either says: boot error. or reboots when it starts loading the kernal? I have never seen anything like it...
2010-07-23T03:52:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	hmm, memory? md5sum the iso image?
2010-07-23T03:52:00.000Z	Planetary		new and old
2010-07-23T03:52:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	btw, pentium D doesn't support 64bit if I remember correctly.
2010-07-23T03:52:00.000Z	Planetary		they ahve worked on other computers and I have checked them
2010-07-23T03:55:00.000Z	Planetary		memory? it has a gig, but  I dont remember the brands.
2010-07-23T03:55:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	So you do you even see the bootloader splash screen when booting from the live cd?
2010-07-23T03:59:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	yes, it comes up and askes if it want to try  or intall ubuntu etc. If I try or intstall it spins teh cd up and then reboots. I have played with the bios too. I have tried this with new and old versions of (x/u/k)buntu
2010-07-23T03:59:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	Have you run memtest86 from the cd?
2010-07-23T03:59:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	I'd run that. just to rule out your memory
2010-07-23T04:00:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	ok, any other ideas?
2010-07-23T04:00:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	hmm, reset bios back to defaults.
2010-07-23T04:01:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	are the cables on the cdrom new or old?
2010-07-23T04:01:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	old
2010-07-23T04:01:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	 do you have any newer ones? I'd also try replacing that.
2010-07-23T04:02:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	if i put a new battery in wouldnt that reset teh bios?
2010-07-23T04:02:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	no
2010-07-23T04:02:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	ok
2010-07-23T04:02:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	usually you have a jumper on the MB that you can use to reset the BIOS back to factory defaults
2010-07-23T04:03:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	ya ok
2010-07-23T04:03:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	Try the BIOS reset first, then try installing, if that fails, run the memtest, if that fails, replace the cdrom cable.
2010-07-23T04:03:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	if that all fails... dude I'm sorry... I'm out of ideas atm
2010-07-23T04:04:00.000Z	Planetary	^peanut^	i can try other ram perhaps. thanks man
2010-07-23T04:04:00.000Z	^peanut^	Planetary	ok good luck... =)
