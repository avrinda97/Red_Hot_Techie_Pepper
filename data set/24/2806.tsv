2008-08-14T07:46:00.000Z	balz		what is the command to install all available updates?  I'd like to be able to update my headless server via ssh
2008-08-14T07:47:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-08-21T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	Avahi
2008-08-21T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	its a zeroconf sort of thing
2008-08-21T13:09:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 that's it!  what's zeroconf?
2008-08-21T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	zero conf is a service discovery... thing.  You can figure out what stuff on your network can do, so you don't have to manually say "I want to find a printer" or in your case "I want to find my music share"
2008-08-21T13:11:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 what's the avahi package name?
2008-08-21T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	Its installed by default... but I have no idea.  search for avahi.  probably like avahi-daemon?
2008-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 i'm on mythbuntu, so a lot of stuff isn't installed by default
2008-09-16T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	you want to link data/video to /media/500gb/vide  so, ln -s /media/500gb/vide data/video
2008-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	It points to another file
2008-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 how do i create one?  i'm getting an error in mythweb that reads "could not create symlink to /media/500gb/vide, the local MythVideo dyrectory.  Please create a symlink to your mythvideo directory at data/video
2008-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	ln is how to make links, -s makes a symlink (soft link).  it's ln -s source dest
2008-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 thanks.  is data/video an actual directory though? that doesn't make much sense to me
2008-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 mostly because there's no / before "data"
2008-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	You're making a symlink to a file, apparently.
2008-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 so my syntax should read "ln -s data/video /media/500gb" ?  How do I know which is source and which is destination based on that message?
2008-09-16T07:05:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 oh I see. okay... that makes much more sense. thanks
2008-10-16T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	We don't support webmin in this channel
2008-10-16T11:59:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 oops! my bad.  Is there a webmin channel?
2008-10-16T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	doesn't look like it, at least not on freenode.  http://www.webmin.com/community.html  has a few ways to get in touch though it seems.
2008-10-16T12:02:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 okay thanks much!
2008-10-29T23:19:00.000Z	Flannel	balz	Is this a new install?  Have you updated since installing? do you have universe enabled?
2008-10-29T23:20:00.000Z	balz	Flannel	 problem solved! t hank you
