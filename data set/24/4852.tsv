2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	Theodor		X is the GUI, yes?
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	Theodor	X is the server which hosts the GUI, which is gnome.
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	Theodor	Think of X as a window display, and Gnome is the mannequins, and Linux is the store.
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	Theodor		but I heard there is "don't know if correct", KDE and xforce or something
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	Theodor	xfce. Although xforce sounds cool.
2006-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	arrenlex		!kde
2006-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	arrenlex		!xfce

2006-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	arrenlex		!best

2006-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	Theodor		I'll be back, time to make a huge gallon of coffee.
2006-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	Theodor	As opposed to a small gallon?
