2011-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	abjjdks832		I'd really appreciate some explanation or how to diagnose this, because I'm sick of it

2011-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	abjjdks832		I visit a web page, whole computer freezes
2011-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	abjjdks832		since when does a userspace process run away and take down teh whole system in linux?
2011-09-29T01:59:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	Just calm down..
2011-09-29T02:00:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	A system freeze is almost always a problem with a kernel driver module.. most commonly, graphics or wifi
2011-09-29T02:00:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	Can you pastebin the output of 'lspci && lsusb && lsmod'?
2011-09-29T02:00:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	to pastebin.com
2011-09-29T02:01:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	and yes, you should run memtest overnight and see if it reports any errors
2011-09-29T02:03:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	Because they're actually three separate programs
2011-09-29T02:03:00.000Z	abjjdks832	soreau	I know that, thanks.

2011-09-29T02:06:00.000Z	soreau	abjjdks832	So your fingerprint reader is built-in?
2011-09-29T02:06:00.000Z	abjjdks832	soreau	yes
