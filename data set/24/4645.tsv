2007-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	CapaH		Well one question... how can I instruct my pings to use eth1 instead of eth0 ?
2007-02-16T09:09:00.000Z	CapaH		i.e. I have an ethernet cable plugged in in addition to wireless -- which is obviously how I am on IRC :)
2007-02-16T09:10:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	 probably  ping -I eth1 de.st.in.ation
2008-09-02T06:36:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	reinstall coreutils
2008-09-02T06:36:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	apt-get reinstall coreutils
2008-09-02T06:37:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	make that aptitude instead
2008-09-02T06:37:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	or  apt-get install --reinstall coreutils
2008-09-02T06:43:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	heh .. you've got yourself into quite a mess with your carelessness there .. hold on
2008-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	Yes - I know :)
2008-09-02T06:50:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	ok.  become root via sudo -i  then type this command out.  cd / && wget -q http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/coreutils/coreutils_6.10-3ubuntu2_i386.deb && dpkg --extract coreutils_6.10-3ubuntu2_i386.deb .
2008-09-02T06:50:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	actually copy/paste the command
2008-09-02T06:51:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	then exit from the root shell and   sudo aptitude reinstall coreutils
2008-09-02T06:52:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	I think I have all my commands back now :)
2008-09-02T06:52:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	just do that aptitude reinstall command to make sure
2008-09-02T06:52:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	as extracting a .deb file like this is not really ideal
2008-09-02T06:53:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	I also overwrote a few other key dirs like /proc /bin /lots of stuff )
2008-09-02T06:53:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	ouccchhh!!
2008-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	well, if i were you, i would reinstall all packages
2008-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	I agree --- what is a good way to do that ? :)
2008-09-02T06:54:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	sudo aptitude reinstall '~i'
2008-09-02T06:56:00.000Z	CapaH	unop	E: I wasn't able to locate file for the linux-headers-2.6.24-19 package. This might mean you need to manually fix this package.
2008-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	errm. yea,  i've run into this before and the only way it seems to fix it, was to manually download the packages and install them by hand -- a real pain
2008-09-02T06:59:00.000Z	unop	CapaH	well, it could be that your problem is fixed just by reinstalling coreutils -- so, it might be safe to continue working with the system.
