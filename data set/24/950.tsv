2011-10-19T05:42:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	I have used it, what u need help with?
2011-10-19T05:45:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	need help with creating shapes ...or rather custom-shapes ...how you tried that ?
2011-10-19T05:47:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	No never tried that, following a guiide?
2011-10-19T05:49:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	I can't seem to find a guide on the subject.  Which is very strange.  On Dia's homepage I found a script that _should_ convert .svg-files to .shape-files ...which is nice as Inkscape is a good tool for creating shapes...however it is not working right :-(
2011-10-19T05:49:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	there is a guide here: http://dia-installer.de/howto/create_shape/index.html.en Is thta what you want to do?
2011-10-19T05:51:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	no... I came across that guide during my search, however it assumes that you wanna create shapes based on already existing shapes in Dia ... now new ones you import.
2011-10-19T05:52:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	*now = not
2011-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	Hmmm, it says: You can also use other tools such as Inkscape to draw your shape, save it in the SVG format and import it to Dia.
2011-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	Could you share a svg file so I can try to import it?
2011-10-19T05:56:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	exactly what I've read ...but it really stinks...both the script and the guide :-) ... how can I send a .svg-file to you ? ..or rather how would you like me to do that ;-) ?
2011-10-19T05:56:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4643243/import-custom-svg-shapes
2011-10-19T05:59:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	HA!....I didn't know you could do that ....that is very cool :-D ... it would be even cooler if it worked correctly :-( ....I only see a black outline of the shape...no colors *sniff*
2011-10-19T06:00:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	you can share in any way
2011-10-19T06:00:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	(...and it duplicates the shape within the shape...weird :-( )
2011-10-19T06:02:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	unfortunately no ...but I was a nice trick you found ..maybe I'm closer to the answer now...so thanx.
2011-10-19T06:03:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	np, I hope you get it right
2011-10-19T06:04:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	I think the problem is the requirements of the .SVG-file ...there must be some definition somewhere of how it should be formatted if it should work with Dia...or rather the .shape-file format....I don't think all .svg-files agrees with Dia.
2011-10-19T06:07:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	Dia is not very flexible in that regard ...so the answer is probably in the 'exported' format ...I which I knew of a .shape-file editor in Linux/Ubuntu ... I haven't been able to find one.  Do you know of any ?
2011-10-19T06:11:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	there is documentation for it in /usr/share/doc/dia-common/custom-shapes.gz Haven't read it but there might be clues
2011-10-19T06:11:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	No, I don't know any other .shape editors
2011-10-19T06:11:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	ok thanx :-) ...I'll take a look.
2011-10-19T06:12:00.000Z	coraxx	scarleo	ok...no worries :-)
2011-10-19T06:14:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	Here is a lot more detailed documentation also: http://dia-installer.de/doc/en/custom-shapes-chapter.html
2011-10-19T06:18:00.000Z	scarleo	coraxx	like 11.3.2. Recognised drawing elements May be a hint of what works from the svg
