2010-09-11T20:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
2010-09-11T20:44:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	i've tried sudo, but i dont know how to save it once i've edited it.
2010-09-11T20:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	:wq
2010-09-11T20:44:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	uh,can you elaborate a bit?]
2010-09-11T20:44:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	but if you have a gui, use the network manager applet
2010-09-11T20:50:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	it worked! thanks a lot :D
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	thats a vi command to save
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	where do i enter that in though? inside the file?
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	in the command-mode of vi
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	ok
2010-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	you can enter the command-mode in vi with ESC
2010-09-11T20:46:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	oh cool. thanks.
2010-09-11T20:51:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	on second though, not so much worked. it saved it apparently, but it didnt do what i wanted.
2010-09-11T20:52:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2010-09-11T20:53:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	you're a lifesaver. thanks.
2010-09-11T20:54:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	not me, vi(m) is the lifesaver .)
2010-09-11T20:57:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	i'm trying to set up the static IP but the interfaces file doesnt seem to want to set what i put in as the stuff that auto eth0 uses.
2010-09-11T20:57:00.000Z	iceroot	Nach0z	paste your interfaces-file to pastebin
2010-09-11T21:01:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	http://paste.ubuntu.com/492231/
2010-09-11T21:04:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	when i put that in, it killed my auto-eth0 and now i have no internet period.
2010-09-11T21:13:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	sudo won't let me type the letter "a" as the beginning of a line. whats goin on?
2010-09-11T21:18:00.000Z	Nach0z	iceroot	i could RAELLY use yur help here. sudo is messing up.
