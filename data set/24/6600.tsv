2005-09-15T08:24:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	what's the error you're getting?
2005-09-15T08:25:00.000Z	charlesj		anybody knows how to change window behaviour during minimize/maximize? or during dragging?
2005-09-15T08:25:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	is there somewhere i can paste mplayers output?
2005-09-15T08:25:00.000Z	umberleigh		ie. somewhere that won't flood the chan
2005-09-15T08:26:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	i'm new around here.... but take a look at the topic
2005-09-15T08:26:00.000Z	umberleigh		:-S
2005-09-15T08:26:00.000Z	charlesj		Use paste.ubuntulinux.nl for pasting
2005-09-15T08:27:00.000Z	umberleigh		will do, didn't see the topic :S
2005-09-15T08:34:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2062 (sorry for the delay)
2005-09-15T08:36:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	just saw
2005-09-15T08:37:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	i managed to compile mplayer fine just today.  and i get that "Try adding "echo 1024 >......" line even though mplayer works fine for me
2005-09-15T08:38:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	did you compile with gui support?
2005-09-15T08:38:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	i didn't compile it, i just used mplayer-386 in the repository
2005-09-15T08:39:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	try running gmplayer
2005-09-15T08:40:00.000Z	umberleigh		i've got it running now. i ran the command manually, as well as 'sudo sysctl -w dev.rtc.max-user-freq=1024'
2005-09-15T08:40:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	great :)
2005-09-15T08:41:00.000Z	charlesj		man.... meatloaf rocks
2005-09-15T08:43:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	i also changed the default video codec to 'Win32/VfW', which eventually got it working
2005-09-15T08:44:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	i shan't see if the rtc thing makes a difference until i reboot (i think)
2005-09-15T08:45:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	wouldn't it be easier to use the UI? you wouldn't have to specify anything then...
2005-09-15T08:45:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	....considerign you're not passing any additional parameters
2005-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	umberleigh	charlesj	i've changed the codec family in gMPlayer
2005-09-15T08:48:00.000Z	umberleigh		i generally only use straight mplayer when I want to see what's going on, ie. when i've got a problem.
2005-09-15T08:48:00.000Z	charlesj	umberleigh	ok
