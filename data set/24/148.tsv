2012-06-15T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	it looks like you have a package conflict in it's dependencies
2012-06-15T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	which repo are you getting codeblocks from, and do you have any PPA's or 3rd party repos enabled
2012-06-15T13:49:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	i have problem with every apps i want to install not only codeblocks, you see!
2012-06-15T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	understood, do you have any PPA's or 3rd party repos enabled ?
2012-06-15T13:49:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	yes
2012-06-15T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	which ones ?
2012-06-15T13:50:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	what do u mean which ones?
2012-06-15T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	which PPA's and 3rd party repos do you have enabled ?
2012-06-15T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	recovery mode won't work it has no relevence, rob82_pcrs has been removed from the channel for trying to miss-lead you
2012-06-15T13:53:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	can u say step by step for me what to do?
2012-06-15T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	which PPA's and 3rd party repos do you have enabled
2012-06-15T13:54:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	many
2012-06-15T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	ok, well, it's clear without checking further that they are causing the conflict, you need to work out which repos are causing the conflict, remove the conflicting software and dependencies and then move forward
2012-06-15T13:55:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	here http://paste.ubuntu.com/1042158/
2012-06-15T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	that's a lot, and a lot of bad ones
2012-06-15T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	do you need all of those ?
2012-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	maybe
2012-06-15T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	you need to work out what you actually want and need, if you need all of them then you are going to have to learn how to check for dependency conflicts and learn how to manage them
2012-06-15T14:02:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	what should i do now?
2012-06-15T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	exactly what I said
2012-06-15T14:02:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	but how?
2012-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	well, the first step is working out which of those PPA's you actually need
2012-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	SajjaD	ikonia	how can i disable ppa's that make problems?
2012-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	ikonia	SajjaD	you can't, that's why I said you need to work out which ones you actually need, then remove the software of the ones you don't need AND all theid dependencies
