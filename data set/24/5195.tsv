2006-09-26T14:44:00.000Z	Sivik	wols	all i was talking about that new stuff that happens in the dmesg is at the bottem, i didn't know he was talking about the dm stuff

2006-09-26T14:47:00.000Z	wols	Sivik	/etc/ssh/sshd_config IIRC
2006-09-26T14:47:00.000Z	Sivik	wols	the school seems to have blocked port 22 but they haven't blocked port 80 yet, i will just move my ssh to that port
