2007-08-17T16:49:00.000Z	Tiggzz		lo peeps. I have just been looking at the ATI X--- install issue in the noobs section. Is this still needed, or doe sit just install now. Thatwas dated april
2007-08-17T16:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	ATI anything, and you can almost always count on problems
2007-08-17T16:50:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	so will I need to do the install from the alternate cd? Will I still be able to use a 64bit version?
2007-08-17T16:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	well, 64bit has issues all its own, no matter what video card you use.... if you're new to Linux, i wouldn't mess with it, stick with 32bit.
2007-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	ok will do. I did ask before and was told no problem but that was before I found the ati issue.
2007-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	you might get it to work, you might not, i'd just stick with 32bit, no matter wht.. thats my personal opinion.
2007-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	so still alternate, or can I go from the livecd?
2007-08-17T16:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	ive got perfectly comptabile hardware w/ Nvidia, and i only use the Alternate, i don't like the live cd's, so i'm probably not the best person to ask.. :)
2007-08-17T16:53:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	I am going to be using mythtv on it, and recoding video. Thats why I thought I'd take advantage of the 64bit. But knowing how bad 64bit is in Doze, I did wonder
2007-08-17T16:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	its just my opinion, i wouldn't mess with it, but do as you please
2007-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	I'll bow to superior experiance. As I have none!!
2007-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	lol, i wouldn't go that far
2007-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	well thanks anyway. I'll try the live cd, if it don't work then I'll go alternate. hell, it's only 20mins!!
2007-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	very true..
2007-08-17T05:06:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	If I've got a display when in live cd, will I still have on eonce it's installed, or does it not work like that?
2007-08-17T05:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	as long as all goes well, it should
2007-08-17T05:09:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	what size wold you recommend the partitions to be on an 80gb drive. I want to put my home seperate, after much recommendation
2007-08-17T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	well, i never separate my home partition, i see people's reasoning, but it serves no use to me.... so i couldn't realy give you a recommendation.
2007-08-17T05:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	generally, depending on media files you want to add, etc, 10-12gigs would be plenty for a normal ubuntu install, but you want to use Mythtv, so you'll need more than that, probably in the 25-35
2007-08-17T05:12:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	so say 30 for system , 2gb for sway and the rest home?
2007-08-17T05:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	i guess that would work..... don't know, you need to leave some room for windows to expand
2007-08-17T05:13:00.000Z	Tiggzz	IndyGunFreak	the 80 is entirely for ubuntu, doze is on a seperate drive
2007-08-17T05:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	oh ok.
2007-08-17T05:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Tiggzz	but like i said, i don't ever install ubuntu that way, so i can't say for sure.
