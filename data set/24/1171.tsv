2010-06-03T13:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Oh I see, they changed it, it's "oowriter" now
2010-12-26T08:27:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	?
2010-12-26T08:27:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Well, you said you were able to log in to GUI with the new account, meaning old one didn't work
2010-12-26T08:29:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Well, open Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center and search there, OR open Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal and type this in: sudo apt-get install kvirc
2010-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	mind answering me ?
2010-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Mind repeating what you said? Mighta skipped it
2010-12-26T08:32:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	I want to install kvirc on ubuntu , i'm new , when installing a software , should i look into some repository or something and what are dependencies ?
2010-12-26T08:32:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	As I said, APT handles dependencies automatically. Open Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center and search for your software there.
2010-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Dependencies are... okay... it's kinda like... say, to play a CD you'd need a CD-ROM. Thus, CD-ROM is a dependency of a CD. Kinda like that.
2010-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	gotcha
2010-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	 where can i learn keyboard shortcuts for things , like switch between different desktops ( 4 of them are avaialble i think )
2010-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. You can see a full list there and even add custom ones.
2010-12-26T08:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Well, it's most likely a connection issue
2010-12-26T08:44:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	but i have 1 mbps line , i hope the file size is not too large , because it installed only 14%
2010-12-26T08:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Well, that's actually more like 28% cause it only downloads till 50%, then it starts installing.
2010-12-26T08:58:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	Or run IE trough WINE.
2010-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	Northwoods	theadmin	WINE ?
2010-12-26T08:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	It's a thing to run Windows programs. See http://winehq.org
2011-11-30T12:09:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	That's a *very* complicated password you have... xD
2011-11-30T12:12:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	You should be able to type commands in the unity dash
2011-11-30T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	Northwoods	But you can try a separate app for this such as krunner, Katapult or Gnome-Do...
