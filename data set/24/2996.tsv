2008-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: Is there a set of ATI Drivers on the Repository? If so, what are they called?
2008-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	sure, both open-source, and proprietary
2008-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	names?
2008-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	fglrx are the proprietary drivers.
2008-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	They're generally better i assume?
2008-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	depends on your needs.

2008-08-20T09:10:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	xine is another option
2008-08-20T09:10:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	Which is better? I've personally never liked vlc
2008-08-20T09:11:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	depends on your preference.
2008-08-20T09:29:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	did you read the medibuntu info I sent you?
2008-08-20T09:30:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	I added it already, and installed libdvdcss2
2008-08-20T09:30:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	so what's the problem?
2008-08-20T09:30:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	It doesn't play, as i mentioned ;), but i gatta go to bed. I've spent hours fighting linux tonight haha, cant take anymore
2008-08-20T09:31:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	I know what it doesn't do.  What _does_ it do when you try?
2008-08-20T09:32:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	Heh sorry, just tired and being smart. My bad. totem-xine just stalls at the front of the dvd (some dvd legal message, etc)
2008-08-20T09:32:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	well, come back tomorrow and we can work through it
2008-08-20T09:33:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	apt-cache policy ubuntu-restricted-extras, to tell for sure
2009-01-15T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	Leefmc	you probably didn't install the proper mp3 support packages
2009-01-15T08:59:00.000Z	Leefmc	tritium	Actually i already ripped one cd to mp3, but then the bug showed its ugly head. I cant rip the 2nd
