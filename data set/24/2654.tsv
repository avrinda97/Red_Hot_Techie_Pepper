2008-10-04T01:31:00.000Z	momesana		hi everybody
2008-10-04T01:31:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	time to pick a new password
2008-10-04T01:35:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	apt-get has the "-s" key to simulate what actions it would take.
2008-10-04T01:40:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	I still have gentoo on my laptop.
2008-10-04T01:40:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	that's fine.  I was just responding to MichaelScott's mild attack on ubuntu.
2008-10-04T01:41:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	compiling the stuff sucks if you do an emerge -u world everyday ( as many gentoo ricers do ) but doing it once a month isn't annoying at all
2008-10-04T01:46:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	hence my call for him to return to the topic
2008-10-04T01:47:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	I think convenience is a relative term. Ubuntu is definetly more convenient for starters or peaple who won't to quickly set up a gentoo box to get some job done. But developers or people who want full control will find gentoo more convenient
2008-10-04T01:47:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	the same development tools are available on ubuntu.
2008-10-04T01:48:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	yes but gentoo has some benefits. You can write ebuilds very quickly and try out different versions of softwarepackages with your developed software
2008-10-04T01:49:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	as you can do with source .deb packages.
2008-10-04T01:49:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	that is just by masking different versions of a package. And developers are usually the sort of people who want full control anyway
2008-10-04T01:49:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	yes. But I think ebuilds are more accessible and easier to work with
2008-10-04T01:49:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	rpm are for example really really awkward to create
2008-10-04T01:50:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	your'e veering off-topic again.  Source repos are easily added, and source packages are trivial to build.
2008-10-04T01:51:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	I guess when ubuntu had been available a few years earlier I wouldn't have switched to gentoo. But nowadays it's different. ubuntu is there, easy to use and has updated packages. that wasn't like that a few years ago. debian was made up of old packages. testing and unstable were really unstable and sort of unusable. Gentoo was very clean and uptodate those days
2008-10-04T01:52:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	let's move on, please
2008-10-04T01:52:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	as I said I am against leading such flamewars. It's a matter of taste. So let's get my apt-get update thing right :-P
2008-10-04T01:55:00.000Z	tritium	momesana	you can "apt-get source <packagename>"
2008-10-04T01:57:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	that problem I can't even find qt in the aptitute. I need it for development
2008-10-04T01:57:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	I guess that's because I didn't have all those thirdparty repos activated
2008-10-04T01:58:00.000Z	momesana	tritium	I've activated them now but apt needs to fetch some files in order to update it's list of packages
