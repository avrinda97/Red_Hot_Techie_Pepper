2009-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	kditty		can anyone help me with my problem of playing xvid and divx files in jaunty jackalope?
2009-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	kditty		i only get sound and no video
2009-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	have you got the codecs installed?
2009-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras should take care of that and other propritary stuff
2009-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	and which player were you trying to play them in?
2009-06-13T06:10:00.000Z	kditty	sebsebseb	ill try that line in terminal but i believe i have it. maybe a reboot after install?
2009-06-13T06:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	no this is Linux not Windows, you only need to reboot for major stuff, such as say a new kernel
2009-06-13T06:10:00.000Z	kditty	sebsebseb	also i am trying vlc, xine, gxine. mplayer pretty much all of them
2009-06-13T06:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	if mplayer can't do it hum
2009-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	Banshee is another,  I guess it's better as a music player really though
2009-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	kditty	sebsebseb	it came to this when i ran that line: E: Couldn't find package ubuntu-restricted-extra
2009-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	s at the end
2009-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	extras
2009-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	kditty		ubuntu-restricted-extras is already the newest version
2009-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	humm
2009-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	kditty		this is strange
2009-06-13T06:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	maybe  midibuntu is of  some use in your case, but  I thought could just play divx and xvid without needing midibuntu
2009-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!midibuntu | kditty
2009-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb		spelling humm
2009-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	kditty		!medibuntu | kditty
2009-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!medibuntu | kditty
2009-06-13T06:14:00.000Z	kditty		thans sebsebseb  ill check this out brb
2009-06-13T06:15:00.000Z	kditty		thanks*
2009-06-13T06:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kditty	if that's no good,  your issue is something else entirely it seems
