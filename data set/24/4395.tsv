2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		I am sharing internet (via firestarter)   to my desktop as for some  reason it can't connect to my router (too far away)
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		however, my laptop can.. problem is.. I'm afraid I'm going to kill my LCD in my laptop having it on all the time
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		but if I shut the lid.. bam. Internet disconnects
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		from the laptop I mean.. therefore.. no connection to even share
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		pisses me off because I went to power management and set everything accordingly
2009-04-11T15:27:00.000Z	Lanlost		sorry... im just crazy tired and I wanted to fix this.. it's been driving me crazy. All I have happen when laptop lid is closed.. at all.. is  to turn off the monitor
2009-04-11T15:27:00.000Z	Lanlost		presario c500
2009-04-11T15:28:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	does it go in standby when you close the lid?
2009-04-11T15:30:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	so you are sure it's not going into standby?
2009-04-11T15:31:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	the only thing I can think up of right now is that some script is getting executed when closing the lid, There's a whole bunch somewhere in /etc
2009-04-11T15:31:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	an ACPI event might actually be firing
2009-04-11T15:33:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	just wondering what happens when you do /etc/init.d/acpid stop and then close the lid?
2009-04-11T15:35:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	you're still here yes
2009-04-11T15:36:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	and to answer your other question, I think it might actually be possible for some ACPI things to behave differently depending on the model. And maybe it's even possible for there to be some firmware somewhere doing something.
2009-04-11T15:36:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	so wait, the problem still occurs?
2009-04-11T15:37:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	probably because for IRC you have to time out, some packets get lost but oh well.
2009-04-11T15:37:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	I'm wondering if this is an issue with Firestarter (or actually what it uses to share the connection)
2009-04-11T15:38:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	so wait, you close the lid and wifi disconnects?
2009-04-11T15:39:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	this just sounds way too weird
2009-04-11T15:40:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	ok well, silly suggestion, but can't you just turn the LCD display off?
2009-04-11T15:40:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	it doesn't do it on mine, X61t
2009-04-11T15:41:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/359199 -- the only bug report I could find
2009-04-11T15:44:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	I'm not sure if drawing black matters all that much :-) But I honestly don't know
2009-04-11T15:49:00.000Z	Brucevdk	Lanlost	I'm going to work on some other things, but good luck :-)
