2011-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	as you are the solver around here ;)  do you know whether this is save todo? http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/how-to-reset-ubuntugnome-settings-to-defaults-without-re-installing/
2011-01-10T00:59:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	it may work, but it may also erase a lot of useful configurations. If you only want to reset the panel, or some other application, you may edit something more specific like gconf
2011-01-10T01:01:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	but I can't login anymore after I deleted .gnome2/keyrings :f :D I think it's my only solution
2011-01-10T01:02:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	oh, you did it already, and only now you are asking if it's safe enough?! He he! You could probably reinstall. Or try to reinstall gnome?
2011-01-10T01:03:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	nono :D I did the keyrings thing to avoid the annoying message @ login, but I erased a litle bit to much :D
2011-01-10T01:03:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	and I think resetting gnome is the only solution, hence the link
2011-01-10T01:03:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	you followed some tutorial to avoid some "annoying message at login"?
2011-01-10T01:05:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	yes in some way and I never do it again, :D I can say I know ubuntu quite well and I do know when something can be trust or not, only the .gnome2 dir is unknown terrain for me :D
2011-01-10T01:06:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	but what did you do exactly? I see no "annoying message". I do remember some distributions ago, may be 3, the password was asked to connect to activate my wireless connection, one distribution later, it was no longer needed.
2011-01-10T01:07:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	but now the annoying messages are my problem not anymore :D as I can't login anyway
2011-01-10T01:08:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	yes, perhaps something like that.
2011-01-10T01:09:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	that would be "reinstall", so it reinstalls.
2011-01-10T01:15:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	"sudo aptitude reinstall ubuntu-desktop", can you post in a pastebin the output of that? Perhaps you have messed up sources list.
2011-01-10T01:15:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	okay
2011-01-10T01:16:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	okay this was retarted :D  ubuntu-desktop is not installed and can't thus be reinstalled :D
2011-01-10T01:19:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	so you didn't install ubuntu-desktop?
2011-01-10T01:20:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	I removed it a couple of minutes ago
2011-01-10T01:28:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	you should actually edit the file yourself, to make sure the file is correctly changed. Like "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
2011-01-10T01:28:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	I just checked to be sure :p
2011-01-10T01:30:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	I was expecting some awesome tool :D aptitude did know that too
2011-01-10T01:39:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	oh, you should have mentioned that. You can probably download the alternate CD to install the packages you don't currently have, to reinstall gnome, for example
2011-01-10T01:40:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	I have a bucn of cd's over here :p but I prefer doing it command line
2011-01-10T01:41:00.000Z	vocx	Kruptein	but how are you going to reinstall gnome if you cannot use the internet. It's not possible, is it?
2011-01-10T01:41:00.000Z	Kruptein	vocx	I just need to unlock my network :D
