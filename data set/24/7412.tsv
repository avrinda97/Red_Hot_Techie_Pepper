2006-06-28T09:57:00.000Z	Ng	net	erk. perhaps try creating a new mozilla profile? (possibly -P)

2006-06-28T10:07:00.000Z	Ng	net	I'm not really sure what to suggest. Did you try a new profile? (sorry if you already answered about that, I was away from the computer)
2006-06-28T10:07:00.000Z	net	Ng	new user profile???
2006-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	Ng	net	yeah, if you run it from a terminal with --help it should show an option you can add to get the profile manager. run it with that from the terminal and create a new profile with it
2006-06-28T10:09:00.000Z	net	Ng	with terminal no, but i make new profile with Admin>users & groups... it not help...
2006-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	Ng	net	ah. hmm, perhaps try reinstalling mozilla then, but I'm running out of ideas :/

2006-06-28T10:11:00.000Z	Ng	net	synaptic ought to be able to do it for you
2006-06-28T10:11:00.000Z	Ng	net	search for the mozilla package and right click on it
2006-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	net	Ng	i will need ubuntu cd?
2006-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	Ng	net	you shouldn't do, synaptic can use internet based repositories
2006-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	net	Ng	ok, i will try... ... ...
