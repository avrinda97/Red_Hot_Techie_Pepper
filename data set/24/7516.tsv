2004-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	nforce
2004-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	There is an nvagp module for some systems for their cards too, but they suggest agpgart or whatever it is though:)
2004-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	check recieving options, i think it's over ride server supplied namespace
2004-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	I've tried that and it didnt' seem to work, do I need to kill off evolution to get that to work?:)
2004-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	might be a good option to restart evo
2004-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	No joy
2004-11-08T06:33:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	what is the folder called on the server?
2004-11-08T06:34:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	so it is Mail/INBOX for the inbox?
2004-11-08T06:37:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	Erm, since I'm bad an explaining stuff, to explain what I'm seeing I created this:) http://img99.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img99&image=evolution-thunderbird.png
2004-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	oh hm, you could try to copy the personal namespace of tbird as namespace in evo and do disable 'show only subscribed folders'
2004-11-08T06:40:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	I had quite some trouble to get evo and tbird play nice on the same imap account
2004-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	I ended up letting evo decide the layout and Tbird just copying it
2004-11-08T06:41:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	evo is much less flexible than tbird
2004-11-09T07:37:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	'Dreaded' not 'desired' :)
2004-11-09T07:37:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	oh must have misread
2004-11-10T08:04:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	I asked specifically for a paste of ls -l install, knowing that it's just one line, but ah well...
2004-11-10T08:04:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	Yeah I saw that:)
2004-11-10T08:04:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	Knew exactly what you wanted too
2004-11-10T08:05:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	yeah, nowadays nobody reads *at all*
2004-11-10T08:05:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	Damn, and I'm only 18.
2004-11-10T08:05:00.000Z	stvn	Pizbit	you prolly grew up in a protected environment ;)
2004-11-10T08:06:00.000Z	Pizbit	stvn	Hardly :)
