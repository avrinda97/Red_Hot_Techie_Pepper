2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	here's the page http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Distributions
2007-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	I configured that same card, let me find the website
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	thanks man you're a life saver
2007-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	what is the website!
2007-01-20T07:26:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	you're right, these instructions are old. Basically ndiswrapper lets you use the windows drivers from the cd on linux, and in this case it is the only way to make WUSB54G work
2007-01-20T07:28:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	in the instructions they have sample driver names, but make sure you use the acutal driver name when you do it, like WUSB54G.inf or something
2007-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	I install the driver using ndiswrapper -i drive.inf then ndiswrapper -l then I get driver invalid and that driver is the one that came with the adapter??
2007-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	are you sure that is the only driver that came on the cd? I remember there being at least two.
2007-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	my is v4 theres also v1 and v2 should I try to install them?
2007-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	no, v4 is a different chipset than v1 and v2, so the other two won't work
2007-01-20T08:04:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	I only copyed the .inf file when I installed
2007-01-20T08:04:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	yes
2007-01-20T08:05:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	then that's definitely the driver you should use. I had the same kind of problem with the invalid driver, but I finally got it to work somehow
2007-01-20T08:05:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	the odd thing is that the first time I installed ubuntu i got my connection automatically now it just won't work!
2007-01-20T08:06:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	that's pretty cool. I don't know how that happened, because I thought ndiswrapper was the only way to install that adapter
2007-01-20T08:07:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	how do uninstall the driver so I can try to reinstall again?
2007-01-20T08:08:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	I can't remember - try typing "man ndiswrapper" for a list of options
2007-01-20T08:09:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	it says ndiswrapper -e driver.inf but it says driver not installed try ndiswrapper -l to see the list
2007-01-20T08:10:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	dude this thing makes no f,, sence!
2007-01-20T08:11:00.000Z	phixnay	chiarato	see what the list says. You might not be typing the name exactly the way it appears.
2007-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	i got installed!
2007-01-20T08:28:00.000Z	chiarato	phixnay	but still couldn't connect i'm rebooting now! to see what happens
