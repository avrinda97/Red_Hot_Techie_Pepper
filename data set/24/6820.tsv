2005-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	_SWAT_		[j] [a] [r] [e] [d] , remember this line well "apt-get upgrade"
2005-07-07T07:08:00.000Z	_SWAT_		:)
2005-07-07T07:09:00.000Z	_SWAT_		[j] [a] [r] [e] [d] ,  Sorry forget something -->  "sudo apt-get upgrade"  (it upgrades all system components)
2005-07-07T07:09:00.000Z	_SWAT_		[j] [a] [r] [e] [d] , do a "apt-cache search firefox"
2005-07-07T07:10:00.000Z	_SWAT_		[j] [a] [r] [e] [d] , just use "sudo apt-get upgrade" it's the easiest
2005-07-07T07:10:00.000Z	_SWAT_		[j] [a] [r] [e] [d] , it's like a 'windows update' only it also updates all other programs
2005-07-07T07:11:00.000Z	_SWAT_		Guys, I'm so tired, I'm going to sleep now. Till tomorrow! Nighty night all!
2005-07-07T05:31:00.000Z	_SWAT_		Anyone here got experience with Fluxbox/XFCE/Enlightentment on Ubuntu? (are they good/bad?) I want to really pimp my desktop :D
2005-07-07T05:33:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_SWAT_	: use blackbox and try mplayer -rootwin file.avi
2005-07-07T05:35:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	why should I try "mplayer -rootwin file.avi" ? Will it hang or gwhat?
2005-07-07T05:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_SWAT_	: no, it will play a vid as your background, basically, an animated background
2005-07-07T05:36:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	nice url by the way (it's still up)

2005-07-07T05:39:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_SWAT_	: click all 3 mouse buttons on the desktop for menus, and if you use the scroll wheel it flips desktops/workspaces
2005-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	thnx for the intell. And sometimes old is better (if it's updated regular)
2005-07-07T05:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_SWAT_	: thing with blackbox is, it renders a GUI, from there a user can make it do what a he wants, makin the interface unique and very usable
2005-07-07T06:06:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	just to make this chan more personal, what's your asl+job? 21/M/Netherlands, Job: Student

2005-07-07T09:19:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	inc595 @ fluxbox.... does it support dual-screen? (does it work)
2005-07-07T09:20:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	_SWAT_	: i think dual-screen has only to do with xorg not the window manager
2005-07-07T10:01:00.000Z	_SWAT_	lsuactiafner	27.000 :/
