2012-11-07T09:56:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	you need to check your manufacturer manual of your motherboard..
2012-11-07T09:57:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	sometimes you need to be in 'Advanced mode' to alter that setting
2012-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	Oooops	jagginess	select "UEFI/Legacy Boot" to "UEFL only" in bios?
2012-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	are you using another operating system on your harddrive?

2012-11-07T09:59:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	since you're getting that error message, try option #2

2012-11-07T10:02:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	there's probably helpful bootoptions for your install media-- i never used uefi.. but i think someone here said they did
2012-11-07T10:03:00.000Z	Oooops	jagginess	i just want find one who just use UEFI. :D
2012-11-07T10:06:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	if efi is too problematic**, you can try the hybrid mode and maybe try to force the installer not to look at efi
2012-11-07T10:07:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	(and turn off "secure boot" if you have this option)
2012-11-07T10:07:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	(in the bios)
2012-11-07T10:07:00.000Z	Oooops	jagginess	no see this.
2012-11-07T10:08:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	option1 looked like a hybrid mode
2012-11-07T10:08:00.000Z	Oooops	jagginess	legacy only?
2012-11-07T10:09:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	is the harddrive gpt ?
2012-11-07T10:10:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	gparted live cd would say -- i don't know how strict this determines if the installer forces itself to efi if it sees a gpt drive
2012-11-07T10:10:00.000Z	jagginess	Oooops	maybe someone here knows (google this)
