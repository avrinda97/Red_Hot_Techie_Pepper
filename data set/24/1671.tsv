2009-10-16T12:16:00.000Z	lilzeus		I have a Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 and I am trying to get all the buttons working. Instructions I find say to modify the InputDevice section of my xorg.conf file but there is no InputDevice section...where do I make the changes?
2009-10-16T12:16:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	you create one... man page for xorg.conf
2009-10-16T12:17:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	will I need to restart?
2009-10-16T12:18:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	how do I do that?
2009-10-16T12:18:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	log out, wait for a new login
2009-10-17T12:43:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	I can see you. I'm just not answering.
2009-10-17T12:43:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	mainly because I don't know (1) what you're asking, and (2) how to answer
2009-10-17T12:44:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	my network card/internet will not work after a restart, I even tried an extra card, still nothing
2009-10-17T12:44:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	I am on a second machine, connected via KVM
2009-10-17T12:44:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	several times, like I said, I even installed other cards
2009-10-17T12:45:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	so, what card is it?
2009-10-17T12:46:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	original was onboard card, extra I installed/tried was a linksys
2009-10-17T12:47:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	correct, I cannot get internet/networking
2009-10-17T12:47:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	I'll leave you in the capable hands of phoenixandthor
2009-10-17T13:29:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	hm? whatsucks?
2009-10-17T13:30:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	my problem is complicated and I can't get help
2009-10-17T13:34:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	heh. Depends.
2009-10-17T14:22:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	let me guess... on a Ubuntu-based system?
2009-10-17T14:22:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	yes, of course
2009-10-17T14:23:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	hm. Then that's a wee bit of a problem. Check dates on:  ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list
2009-10-17T14:24:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	brb to try that
2009-10-17T14:25:00.000Z	lilzeus	Viking667	that list was huge, and unusable
2009-10-17T14:26:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	you want to sort by date. There's a parameter for ls to sort by date.
2009-10-17T14:26:00.000Z	Viking667	lilzeus	your question was: what are the latest packages I've installed... right?
