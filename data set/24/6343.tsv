2010-10-23T01:46:00.000Z	ubuntuman		no one on the planet seems to have the same ussue as i recieve, asked every linux person and still no answer... why does ubuntu fail to boot unless hold down return
2010-10-23T01:47:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	Did you reconfigure an initcript (shutdown or kill script) ?
2010-10-23T01:48:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	nope no reconfiguration
2010-10-23T01:49:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	At what stage does it stop initiating the shutdown ? ... whats printed before you have to press enter ?
2010-10-23T01:50:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	its not the shutdown, upon bootup it just stops. no hard drive activity or anything
2010-10-23T01:51:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	Whats printed before it stops initiating other services then ?
2010-10-23T01:51:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	nothing it sometimes comes up with the GUI boot screen, other times just a flashing underscore cursor with when holding return moves down the page
2010-10-23T01:53:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	i havent just had this issue with ubuntu though. meego also does the same thing
2010-10-23T01:53:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	Aha, Hmm.. Thats a problem. You need to add options to grub.conf for the bootup kernel. ACPI options or Graphics card options
2010-10-23T01:53:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	I dont know what meego is, havnt tried it
2010-10-23T01:54:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	A very new dist i suppose ?
2010-10-23T01:54:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	its that intel nokia thing based on linux. but Windows boots up fine but i have tried reinstalls, updates etc and nothing seems to overcome this issue
2010-10-23T01:55:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	Sounds like they have issues with the initscripts taken from Gerard Beekman
2010-10-23T01:56:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	See the "function" initscript. Make it not halt at petty errors such as starting a server.
2010-10-23T01:56:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	i have tried looking in the logs and there is nothing in there about the boot sequencing
2010-10-23T01:57:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	The init scripts have no reason to do logging of any kind as the programs are ok.
2010-10-23T01:57:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	ok i'll take a look at the moment im in windows for work but i will try that later
2010-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	grep -i halt bootscripts_directory
2010-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	ok so that command would fix it?
2010-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	It should never halt unless its utmost critical
2010-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	Hell no, itll show where a possible problem resides
2010-10-23T02:03:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	are you on the forum to be able to PM the results of the command?
2010-10-23T02:04:00.000Z	Alpha	ubuntuman	No, i only entail my mind if i feel it can be of value to both parties
2010-10-23T02:05:00.000Z	ubuntuman	Alpha	ok well it might be tomorrow (GMT) by the time i get this done been up since 5am working all day
