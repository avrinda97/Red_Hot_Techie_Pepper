2011-07-02T23:57:00.000Z	shockrates		hey
2011-07-02T23:58:00.000Z	shockrates		is there a 64bit wine available for 11.04?
2011-07-02T23:59:00.000Z	shockrates		i have a problem installing wine
2011-07-02T23:59:00.000Z	shockrates		when it tried to get some fonts from sourceforge, it cant connect
2011-07-03T00:01:00.000Z	shockrates		who is the idiot who packaged wine in ubuntu?
2011-07-03T00:01:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	apt-cache show wine shows you the maintainer
2011-07-03T00:02:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	Maintainer: Scott Ritchie <scottritchie@ubuntu.com>
2011-07-03T00:03:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	i doubt that, what is the problem you are having?
2011-07-03T00:03:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	people here are volunteers or people with a problems, not likely to get direct support from a package maintainer here if he/she is even here
2011-07-03T00:04:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	i try to install wine (11.04 ubuntu 64bit here), specifically wine1.3, the installation gets the package from ubuntu then it tries to get some fonts/sources from sourceforge. those sourceforge links are broken/dont connect, so installation hangs. i have tried 3 times to install wine and it fails....
2011-07-03T00:05:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	that would be a bug, you can file that on launchpad
2011-07-03T00:05:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	i have recently created an account in ubuntu forums. is there a tool to get to report bugs?
2011-07-03T00:06:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	see the factoid ubottu just gave you
2011-07-03T00:10:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	i just installed wine1.3 and didnt give me any troubles with missing font packages as its downloading them right now?
2011-07-03T00:11:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	did you get the fonts or whatever it downloads from sourceforge?
2011-07-03T00:11:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	yeah works just fine
2011-07-03T00:11:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	if a bit slow
2011-07-03T00:11:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	for me it doesnt
2011-07-03T00:11:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	i dont know why, i try to manual open the links with firefox, doesnt work either
2011-07-03T00:12:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	are you behind some sort of proxy perhaps?
2011-07-03T00:13:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	i dont think so. can you give me the first link of sourceforge in your installation to try it?
2011-07-03T00:14:00.000Z	acicula	shockrates	its the same as you, its a generick link which redirects
2011-07-03T00:15:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	is there a different launchpad for ubuntu
2011-07-03T00:15:00.000Z	shockrates	acicula	or i report kubuntu bugs in launchpad
