2005-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	carthik		perhaps
2005-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	carthik		cb, can you hear any sounds at all? from other apps etc?
2005-04-20T14:27:00.000Z	carthik		mplayer should have an option to change the audio output driver to ESD
2005-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	carthik		and then I stop using esd, and use ALSA or the OGG drive instead... settings can be changes using System->Preferences I think

2005-04-20T14:30:00.000Z	carthik	ogra	i'm sorry, i didn't quite get that ... ?
2005-04-20T14:31:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	i was wondering why you suggest killing esd....
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	since all apps are set to it by default, you have a lot to fix afterwards....
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	.... would be easier to point the app t use esd :)
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	carthik	ogra	just so I can see if mplayer works , and if it is the esd problem indeed. of course i bring it back to life immediately after :)
2005-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	ah...
2005-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	carthik	ogra	for some reason, my mplayer could not use esd first, and i was a newbie then (As I quite am now)
2005-04-20T14:34:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	hmm, ao=esd or ao=esound should do it iirc....
2005-04-20T14:35:00.000Z	carthik	ogra	mpegp, oss, null and pcm were the only available drivers... so setting it to use esd did not work for me - I should have typed this long answer before , my apologies :)
2005-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	na, youre more i supportig people then i am, my apologizes for distrubig :)
2005-04-20T14:38:00.000Z	carthik	ogra	I can't thank you enough for the work you put in, so there! :)
2005-04-20T14:38:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	thanks :)

2005-04-23T10:58:00.000Z	ogra	carthik	the current evonotify has a bug that prevents it to work with gnoem 2.10, i'll upload a new tgz before weekend...
