2011-05-21T22:55:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	my script gives me the following error: not foundeplace.sh
2011-05-21T22:56:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	and i dont have anything close to foundeplace.sh in my script
2011-05-21T22:56:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	Has the script ever worked?
2011-05-21T22:57:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	yea earlier this evening on the server. i emailed it to myself and now it isnt working on my home computer!
2011-05-21T22:57:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	Same OS and such?
2011-05-21T22:58:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	can you pastebin your script for me?
2011-05-21T23:00:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	http://paste.ubuntu.com/611141/
2011-05-21T23:03:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	I don't see what could be causing that...
2011-05-21T23:04:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	me too! i just thought of adding #!/bin/bash
2011-05-21T23:04:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	 and then it says bad interpreter
2011-05-21T23:04:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	On my system, I just get the "No such file or directory" as I should running it in my home directory.
2011-05-21T23:05:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	uhh, it has some dependent files so it wont work on any system.
2011-05-21T23:05:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	I just added that, and do not get the "bad interpreter".
2011-05-21T23:05:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	what does "which bash" give you?
2011-05-21T23:06:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	/bin/bash
2011-05-21T23:11:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	Well... poop. :-/
2011-05-21T23:14:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	I created the files/dirs in a tmp folder. Got the script to give me "Number of images=0"
2011-05-21T23:16:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	it worked out, the bash script while being transitioned through a WIN machine got CRs filled in it.
2011-05-21T23:17:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	i figured it out on the #bash channel :D
2011-05-21T23:21:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	Good to know! What was it?
2011-05-21T23:21:00.000Z	sattu94	CrustyBarnacle	MS Carriage Returns while transitioning through an MSWIN PC.
2011-05-21T23:22:00.000Z	CrustyBarnacle	sattu94	Hence working fine on my side... nice
