2007-07-19T06:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jayde_drag0n	I agree with everything stefg told you. The golden rule is to RTFM, and follow the links suggested
2007-07-19T06:13:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		intuitivenipple: why couldn't stefg tell me i could just install and use gnome partiioner?

2007-07-19T06:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jayde_drag0n	That is the beauty of the LiveCD - you have a fully funtioning Ubuntu to work from without touching your hard drive
