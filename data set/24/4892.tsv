2006-12-29T10:33:00.000Z	Bakefy		Can anyone here help me with samba?  the ubuntu site is confusing me.
2006-12-29T10:33:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	what's up?
2006-12-29T10:34:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	Thanks,  I am trying to create a username and password for all of my smb shares
2006-12-29T10:34:00.000Z	Bakefy		windows will not connect if I don't have a username and password
2006-12-29T10:34:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	would you rather not have a password?
2006-12-29T10:35:00.000Z	Bakefy		yeah
2006-12-29T10:35:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	i thought that might be the case
2006-12-29T10:35:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	I can connect with other non windows devices with no trouble
2006-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	I have been told that windows NEEDS a username and password, or it wont ever attempt
2006-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	did you edit /etc/samba/smb.conf?
2006-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	not true, i got it to work
2006-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	I  have only changed the work group
2006-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	I  have XP by the way...
2006-12-29T10:37:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	ok you need to edit a setting in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2006-12-29T10:37:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	there is a section in that file called authentication
2006-12-29T10:38:00.000Z	curs0r		under that line if you see a line that says security = user i want you to place a # in front of that line
2006-12-29T10:38:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	under that line if you see a line that says security = user i want you to place a # in front of that line
2006-12-29T10:39:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	if you don't see that line or if it already has a # that's ok
2006-12-29T10:39:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	then once you take care of that add security = share and save the file
2006-12-29T10:39:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	thats already been done.
2006-12-29T10:39:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	okay I will try that
2006-12-29T10:40:00.000Z	Bakefy	curs0r	 ";   security = user"
2006-12-29T10:40:00.000Z	Bakefy		is currently what I see, is ; a blocked charactor
2006-12-29T10:40:00.000Z	curs0r	Bakefy	put a # in front of it
