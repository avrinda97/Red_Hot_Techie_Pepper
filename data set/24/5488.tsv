2006-07-03T14:16:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	it's not the only way to do things
2006-07-03T14:17:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	i installed sbackup, but never got it to work
2006-07-03T14:17:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	I this the fist tar statement is slight wrong the / should come at the end otherwise the excludes are ignored
2006-07-03T14:18:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	sorry, that didn't make a word of sense
2006-07-03T14:19:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	hang on I will put it in paste bin
2006-07-03T14:20:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	the tar statement that I used is: tar cvpjf backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys /

2006-07-27T11:48:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	lol, thats gonna be fun
2006-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	lol, dude, problem is that is xp/linux again. I don't even own a copy of xp any more
2006-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	if you just want more than one linux distro, then just do a manual partition
2006-07-27T11:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	yea how?

2006-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	gatekeeper	livingdaylight	dapper installer uses GParted, one of the last steps is partitioning, you get a dialog with a radio button, default is do it's own thing, if you select manual partition you can set the disk up the way you want it
2006-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	no way, its impossible to use, common
2006-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	gatekeeper	i found the partitioner on the Dapper livecd impossible, yes
