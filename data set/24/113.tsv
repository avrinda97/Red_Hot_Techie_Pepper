2012-10-11T18:36:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	yes man displays this option
2012-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	are you authenticating via a windows domain?
2012-10-11T18:29:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	 yes
2012-10-11T18:30:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	we use kerberos pam instead of winbind
2012-10-11T18:30:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	its finding that realm= option somewhere and it doesn't like it
2012-10-11T18:31:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	hum no boot options
2012-10-11T18:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	not you
2012-10-11T18:32:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	that option you are having an issue with is in an enabled config file - find and remove.fix it
2012-10-11T18:35:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	I have a configuration OK on lucid with login and pam-krb5. I will copy it on precise et auth.log show me this error. I have a /etc/pam.d/common-auth with option realm on pam-krb5 line
2012-10-11T18:36:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	have you checked the versions of the software (not the OS?) and that he option is still legit (if thats what your getting at)
2012-10-11T18:37:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	what is the complete entry you have in common-auth that looks like 'realm*?'
2012-10-11T18:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	also the man page you got tht line from
2012-10-11T18:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	certainly is there..
2012-10-11T18:40:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	i say, i do a mistake in my message : i replace our local domain by DOMAIN.LOCAL
2012-10-11T18:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	how did you migrte the settings? programatically or just as you saw fit?
2012-10-11T18:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	like how did you move those configs for krb over?
2012-10-11T18:47:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	i move krb5.conf and pam.d config files
2012-10-11T18:48:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	i'll be back in a few minutes

2012-10-11T19:02:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	is there any conflicting entry in krb5.conf?
2012-10-11T19:03:00.000Z	Niarf	SolarisBoy	 no, i can't see the problem (krb5/conf works in lucid)
2012-10-11T19:05:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Niarf	kk im done then =)
