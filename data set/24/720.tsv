2011-02-28T06:50:00.000Z	Fogel		ok, anybody can help me? i need to omit disk partitioning during ubuntu installation and explicitly give it installation directory
2011-02-28T06:50:00.000Z	Fogel		directory NOT partition
2011-02-28T06:50:00.000Z	mickster04	Fogel	select "manual define partitions" when installing?
2011-02-28T06:51:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	no way, it needs to select device, not directory
2011-02-28T06:52:00.000Z	mickster04	Fogel	not sure what you mean
2011-02-28T06:52:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	i have broken partition table
2011-02-28T06:53:00.000Z	mickster04	Fogel	ah ok
2011-02-28T06:53:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	it works, but not for cfdisk and installer

2011-02-28T07:07:00.000Z	mickster04	Fogel	use a live cd all the time?
2011-02-28T07:09:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	it can be an option if i had writeable fs on it :)
2011-02-28T07:09:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	i need some unembedded apps :)
2011-02-28T07:09:00.000Z	mickster04	Fogel	use a usb drive, and what apps are we talking here?

2011-02-28T07:49:00.000Z	Fogel	mickster04	i think debootstrap is solution for my problem, i totally forgot about it...
