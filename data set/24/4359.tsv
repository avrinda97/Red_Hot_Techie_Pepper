2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	Luxurious		Hi guys.
2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	Luxurious		I cannot by any means find what should be the contents of my JAVA_HOME environment variable.
2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	echo ${JAVA_HOME}
2007-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	it isn't set.
2007-06-04T05:57:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	I mean what I should set it to.
2007-06-04T05:57:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	set | grep JAVA
2007-06-04T05:57:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	those only work to tell you what the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to.
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	I need to know WHAT to set it to.
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	at this moment it is not set.
2007-06-04T05:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	did you read that?
2007-06-04T05:59:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	yes, I read that.
2007-06-04T05:59:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	it says nothing about setting the environment variable.
2007-06-04T05:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	tried googling for JAVA_HOME?
2007-06-04T06:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	why don't i believe you? second link is http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=607850&messageID=3317090
2007-06-04T06:01:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	I don't think you read it that much yourself :-)
2007-06-04T06:01:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	seeing how this is not relevant to Linux.
2007-06-04T06:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	you obviously only read the first few bits instead of the entire thing.
2007-06-04T06:02:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	nope, this is not that large a thread.
2007-06-04T06:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	right, and you'll see that the 10th reply actually contains the answer to your question.
2007-06-04T06:03:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	again, that is not relevant to my problem.  I saw a post on the Ubuntu forums that almost was, but all my files seem to reside in /etc/alternatives/ and not /usr/lib/
2007-06-04T06:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	/etc/alternatives/ is a directory that redirects program files symbolically to their real location, so that the main program directory can access them even if they get upgraded
2007-06-04T06:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	you wouldn't actually find anything other than symbolic links in there
2007-06-04T06:05:00.000Z	Luxurious	Gnea	I didn't know that!  That solves the problem actually, as these symbolic links have now lead me to the directory that contains Java.  Thanks a bunch.
2007-06-04T06:05:00.000Z	Gnea	Luxurious	you're quite welcome
