2010-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	I tried arch latest distro and it works fine on this machine bcos it supports i686
2010-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: does ubuntu server supports the i686 ?
2010-06-25T07:18:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	I mean supports i686 cpu with  Dell Latitude e6510 - core i7 720QM CPU, 4GB Nvidia 3100NVS
2010-06-25T07:19:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	I looked at the certified hw list on ubuntu.com and this latitude is not listed
2010-06-25T07:20:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	The best way to find out is really to test it.
2010-06-25T07:21:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: thats what I am trying to do please help me understand abt this server 64 bit version
2010-06-25T07:21:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: like does it support the i686 cpu ?
2010-06-25T07:22:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	if you want 32bit server you'd get the "i386" version.
2010-06-25T07:23:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: please be sure on what you trying to answer ? I am clearly explaining that this machine is an i686 cpu
2010-06-25T07:23:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: why are u pointing me to the i386
2010-06-25T07:24:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: do you belong to this ubuntu forum to answere all the prof Q ?
2010-06-25T07:24:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	I'm a happy user like everyone else.
2010-06-25T07:25:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: you are an Idiot
2010-06-25T07:37:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	This may be your issue? (the gpu rather) http://wwww.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9463220
2010-06-25T07:37:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: I am sorry I was rude to you sir
2010-06-25T07:38:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	nomodeset as a kernel boot option might be something to try, if it is indeed the GPU that is bothering.
2010-06-25T07:39:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	No worries
2010-06-25T07:39:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: I think thats the one bothering me to bootup I tried few kernel param while booting and was not success
2010-06-25T07:41:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: thats the reason I was asking whether I can download 64bit kernel and it supprts the nvida
2010-06-25T07:41:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	I think 32/64bit shouldn't make a difference in that regard, but well, I'm not sure..
2010-06-25T07:42:00.000Z	ravibn	arand	: I mean the latest ubuntu 64bit LTS server but I need the gui like desktop
2010-06-25T07:43:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	If you want the GUI, then either get the desktop CD and install whatever server packages you need, or get the server and install ubuntu-desktop on top of it, I guess...
2010-06-25T07:44:00.000Z	arand	ravibn	Again, if the nvidia issue is the one that keeps you from booting that will likely be the same through all versions, well apart from the alternate install I guess, maybe. Don't know if that one does KMS/Plymouth or not...
