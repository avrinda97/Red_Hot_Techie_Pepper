2009-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		Hi, can someone help me find the proper driver for my Atheros network device?
2009-10-08T06:00:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	Is it an onboard network device or a USB one?
2009-10-08T06:00:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	it is an onboard device
2009-10-08T06:00:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	I believe it is an AtherosEG5007 or soemthing like that
2009-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	What kind of laptop is it?
2009-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	its a Toshiba Satellite
2009-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	mnaines		I got a Satellite, too, but mine uses Intel drivers
2009-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		Satallite A215
2009-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	mnaines		Mine's an A205
2009-10-08T06:02:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		I want to find a driver that will allow packet injection
2009-10-08T06:02:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	The Intel drivers I have support injection automatically
2009-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	I just have to modprobe to the ipwraw drivers
2009-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	I was using airmon-ng and it was telling me that my device didn't support injection
2009-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	Yeah...Its not the drivers...Its the card itself...That particular card isn't supported
2009-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		I was looking at a table about my device and it showed that it is capable of injection with the right driver
2009-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		oh damn
2009-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		so, if I wanted to do injection, I'd need to buy a new network card?
2009-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	Most Atheros cards won't work with BackTrack 3...Intel drivers, D-Link, and Linksys are the only three drivers that have injection capabilites
2009-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	lame, ok thanks
2009-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha		I also have another question. Is it possible for me to install linux, then add software to my harddrive, then make a new live cd that will run live with that new software?
2009-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	The D-Link WUA1310 wireless USB dongle is the best one to use
2009-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	thank you
2009-10-08T06:06:00.000Z	mnaines	GautamaBuddha	Make sure you download the RaLink rt75 drivers for that card.  The rt75 drivers support injection
2009-10-08T06:07:00.000Z	GautamaBuddha	mnaines	awesome, you rock
