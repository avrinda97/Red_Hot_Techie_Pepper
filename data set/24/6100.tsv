2006-01-20T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		What media player do people find best for dealing with a large library of music (a la iTunes and RhythmBox)?
2006-01-20T14:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	I kinda like Kaffiene, myself.
2006-01-20T14:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	And amaroK for music.
2006-01-20T14:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	DathDevilous must've been using Trillian for his IRC client.
2006-01-20T14:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	Ah, that could do it.
2006-01-20T14:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	I use Kaffeine, with the xine engine, for video. It can even re-broadcast the feed. I haven't played with that feature yet. Going to soon. :)
2006-01-20T14:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Well, if he's anything like me, he could have multiple computers as well. You should see my media-server box.
2006-01-20T14:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	Oh, I don't doubt that.  My family has twice as many computers as people, and two of them dual-boot Ubuntu-Windows.
2006-01-20T14:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Heh. In my house, I have 7 towers, a laptop, a TabletPC, a Casiopeia PocketPC, a RAID tower, and 4 4U rackmounts. :)
2006-01-20T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	6 laptops, 4 desktops.
2006-01-20T14:55:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	My media-server, actually can record up to 4 TV shows at the same time, in perfect quality, and stream them over the network using live stream, or VOD. :)
2006-01-20T14:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	Interesting...  Never gotten into that sort of thing, but it sounds cool.
2006-01-20T14:56:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Yeah. It's nice stuff. I don't even own a regular TV anymore. I have one HDTV, without a tuner, and it itself is hooked up through the LAN and is literally streamed directly to, instead of using a TV tuner. :)
2006-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	There is too a rescue option on the install disk
2006-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Where? F1-F10 showed nothing.
2006-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	Type rescue at the prompt
2006-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	I did. It went through the normal installation startup.
2006-02-21T09:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	I'm not sure exactly how it work, but it's there..should get you to a root prompt I think.
2006-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Their really is no special "rescue" mode. It starts up, does it's whole detecting hardware thing, laods up the network via dhcp, and asks what hostname to use. From there, you can use the tty2, but, still.
2006-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	What are you hoping to see?
2006-02-21T10:01:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	Something a LITTLE more useful than busybox's minimal utility set, for one.
2006-02-21T10:04:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	I was trying to copy my hde# to hdg#, making a partition-modified copy of my Kubuntu installation, so I could prevent having to re-install from scratch.
2006-02-21T10:05:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	tonyyarusso	but /dev on a currently running K/Ubuntu system is tmpfs mounted, so I had to use, ironically, Gentoo's boot disc to properly do the cp -a from hde to hdg's stuff.
2006-02-21T10:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Psi-Jack	I see.
