2006-02-22T17:43:00.000Z	sambagirl		what is a proxy server?
2006-02-22T17:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Do you know what a server is?
2006-02-22T17:44:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Good, now consult your dictionary and see what "proxy" means :)
2006-10-01T13:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	It's basic networking.
2006-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	"VPN" is marketing or PHB lingo for "A hacked up secure tunnel across an insecure network that really should've been designed correctly in the first place"
2006-10-01T13:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	The rest of us just use ssh.
2006-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Figure out what the heck you want, then use that.
2006-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Don't just arbituary pull three letters out of the air, 'v', 'p', 'n', and decide you need whatever combination it needs.
2006-10-01T13:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Ok, let's begin with: What do you want?
2006-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Ok, that's got absolutely nothing to do with a vpn.
2006-10-01T13:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Define private.
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	For me, private means "something I don't want other people to see".
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	Therefore, vnc is not a vpn.
2006-10-01T13:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	ssh -XC is a little better, but only works on properly configured linux/unix systems, though it's not a proper vpn.
2006-10-01T13:13:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	A vpn, on the other hand, is an incrypted "virtual" network that spans several non-secure networks.
2006-10-01T13:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	The problem you have is you're trying to ask how to do something with "vpn", and are refusing to realise that a "vpn" is completely different than what you expect.
2006-10-01T13:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	btw, for a vpn, I like ipsec.
2006-10-01T13:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	pptp is a popular windows-compatible vpn as well.
2006-10-01T13:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	My university uses pptp, btw.
2006-10-01T13:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	If you want to access the internet at my university, from your own laptop, you must first connect to the wireless network, which is public.
2006-10-01T13:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	You then setup a vpn to some public server, in our case 'student.vpnwifi', then we effectively have network access.
2006-10-01T13:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	It does not by itself allow us to access windows desktops, we usually walk to building 11 for that.
2006-10-01T13:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	sambagirl	But, you could "export" the desktop, with a program called vnc, and then access that using the same program on your laptop or other system, using any network access, which could be a vpn.
