2006-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		guys, I am starting to be a bit fed up. I have installed kernel-tree package and am looking form the sources of a single module (forcedeth) - and nothing!
2006-03-22T15:25:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		apt-cache search forcedeth gives nothing, too
2006-03-22T15:25:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	it's under device drivers->network->pci->nforce
2006-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	locate nforce | grep network gives nothing
2006-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	did you try locate forcedeth.c
2006-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	well.. you should have it
2006-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	locate forcedeth only gives me some *.h and *.ko files
2006-03-22T15:29:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	I *JUST* showed you where it is
2006-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	notice that you are using a gentoo kernel :)
2006-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	whatever, it'll be in there
2006-03-22T15:32:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	guess what - no such file or directory (tried: cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/)
2006-03-22T15:33:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	looks like we found your problem. you don't have the kernel sources installed
2006-03-22T15:34:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	I have installed kernel-tree package (which depends on kernel-tree and kernel-debian-patches) *before* I have asked the question.
2006-03-22T15:34:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	updatedb; locate forcedeth.c does not show *anything*
2006-03-22T15:34:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	ll -R / | grep forcedeth.c the same
2006-03-22T15:35:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	well, I just looked on my laptop and the file I say exists, does in fact exist
2006-03-22T15:37:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	now I give up. I *have* the newest sources installed and haven't got that file. are you using Breezy (5.10)? Or Dapper? (I'm a Breezyrian).
2006-03-22T15:38:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	well, I'm doing a dist-upgrade right now. but the sources are from breezy
2006-03-22T15:38:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	ok, I'll try to install kernel-tree-2.6.10 instead of *-2.6.11
2006-03-22T15:38:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	why not upgrade?
2006-03-22T15:39:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	$uname -r: 2.6.12-10-k7 - now when you tell me where the *hell* are the sources for the bastard, I'll be more than happy
2006-03-22T15:40:00.000Z	h36sa	rysiek|pl	man, I've already held your hand long enough and you keep telling me I'm wrong when I'm not
2006-03-22T15:41:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	yep, you're right, sorry. I installed kernel-tree-* instead of linux-tree-*
2006-03-22T15:42:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	h36sa	yep, installing it right now...
