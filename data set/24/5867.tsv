2006-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I need help fixing X.  I have some xorg.conf backups that will fail completely, some that will start, but give hashed, fuzzy, out of sync, useless display, and one that will show up fine but lock up if I try to switch to console.
2006-04-17T13:20:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	you're aware of 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' ?
2006-04-17T13:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Yep.  Been through it at least a dozen times - never produces something that works.
2006-04-17T13:21:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	d'oh
2006-04-17T13:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	That was pretty much my sentiment.
2006-04-17T13:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	How could an xorg.conf that worked before not work now?  I copied back in the most recent backup, and nothing.
2006-04-17T13:24:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	(1) something else changed, or (2) it's not the file that worked before.  Computers aren't magic ;).  Sorry, I know I'm not helping.
2006-04-17T13:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Do you at least have a clue what part might be wrong in the ones that produce the funny hashed display, but at least starts?  I can't see anything, but it comes up, so maybe I can work from there.
2006-04-17T13:26:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	hrm. sorry, no.  You've looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2006-04-17T13:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Good point, no.
2006-04-17T13:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Oh my that's a long file!
2006-04-17T13:27:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	yeah. Errors and warnings are specially marked, though; (EE) and (WW) iirc
2006-04-17T13:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Grepping now, cap'n.
2006-04-17T13:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Lots of warnings.
2006-04-17T13:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	I'll pastebin it as soon as I can get it retyped.
2006-04-17T13:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12109 - could you take a look?
2006-04-17T13:39:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	i hope you are not perceiving me as an X guru. i'll take a look, but promise nothing.
2006-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Well, you're all I've got at the moment it seems.
2006-04-17T13:40:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	did X ever work properly? i.e., pre fglrx driver installation?
2006-04-17T13:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	It has in the past worked with all three drivers, ati, radeon, and fglrx.  But now none of those xorg.confs seem to work.
2006-04-17T13:42:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	any possiblity of a hardware bug? dust collecting in connectors etc ?
2006-04-17T13:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	Maybe?  It worked earlier today.
2006-04-19T13:55:00.000Z	roryy	tonyyarusso	i already fixed it (i hope ;)
2006-04-19T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	roryy	No...
