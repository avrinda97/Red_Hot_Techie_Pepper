2007-04-25T09:19:00.000Z	walkintome		im new to linux and am having a hard time installing ndiswrapper
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	walkintome		i am able to compile ndiswrapper, but when running the make command I get this at the end of a whole lot more:
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	walkintome		make[1] : *** [loadndisdriver]  Error 1
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	walkintome		make[1] : Leaving directory `/home/michael/ndiswrapper-1.42/utils'
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	walkintome		make: *** [all]  Error 2
2007-04-25T09:20:00.000Z	walkintome		michael@michael-desktop:~/ndiswrapper-1.42$
2007-04-25T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	did it configure properly
2007-04-25T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	when you ran ./configure, were there errors?
2007-04-25T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	you probably should
2007-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	yeah
2007-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	it doesn't do anything to your system, it is completely harmless
2007-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	like what?
2007-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	walkintome	bruenig	well, ive a linux noob and ive been installing a ton of stuff both successfully and unsuccessfully so i have a hunch that  have quite a few files scattered throughout my linux installation that i dont need and i would like to tidy up =)
2007-04-30T10:08:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	if you installed stuff from the repositories, simply sudo apt-get remove it
2007-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	if you installed it from source, that is another story, you will have to tidy that up on your own, tracking down where the stuff went or compiling again and make uninstalling
2007-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	walkintome	bruenig	well, the problem is i didnt always do that, and i dont even remmber half of the stuff i installed. i would do a clean install but i would have to go through the fuss fo installing my wireless usb driver again and that alone took me 2 days
2007-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	well there is not some automatic thing, that is the reason why ubuntu has package management, so that it can be clean. If you go outside of package managment, unless you are pretty certain in what you are doing, you could have a mess with files scattered all over the place.
2007-05-01T15:02:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	you would need a different theme
2007-05-01T15:02:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	for the first question that is
2007-05-01T15:03:00.000Z	walkintome	bruenig	theres no way to move it over? i love the theme i have no..the buttons are just not in the right spot
2007-05-26T07:47:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	no
2007-05-26T07:47:00.000Z	bruenig	walkintome	as opposed to not running any OS, probably
2007-05-26T07:48:00.000Z	walkintome	bruenig	i dont know what you mean by your second comment--if you meant leaving it around in a pile of sand for instance, then i get it lol
