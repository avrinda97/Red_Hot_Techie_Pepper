2005-04-13T09:56:00.000Z	EvilIdler		Win32 codecs are not multi-arch
2005-04-13T09:58:00.000Z	EvilIdler		Wine doesn't work on AMD64 yet, and noone has done anything crazy like making a Bochs library for PPC..
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	amd64 doesn't really need wine for use a 32bit software
2005-04-13T09:59:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	But you can't get Win32 codecs to work ;)
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	ah ? mine works weird :)
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	If you do know a way, I want to know :)
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	By running a 32-bit program, right?
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	the better way on an amd64 is to make a choot 32bits
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	I know. But I feel dirty doing that.
2005-04-13T10:00:00.000Z	lok`		and relink in the 64 sys the 32bits library
2005-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	I've only got a basic chroot to make some games work.
2005-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	yeah it's 300Mo for w32codec I know but you can also compile OOo 2 or differant software that doesn't works in 64 yet
2005-04-13T10:01:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	I want to keep my system as pure as possible :)
2005-04-13T10:02:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	I only need codecs that I actually use, anyway
2005-04-13T10:02:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	your system keep is status is only ONE progs that use your chroot lib without the chroot
2005-04-13T10:03:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	on your chroot you can also add a firefoy with flash and mplayerplug-in
2005-04-13T10:04:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	Yeah, I know. I have two computers, though, so I'm OK for now :)
2005-04-13T10:04:00.000Z	lok`	EvilIdler	do you know something about a wine64 ?
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	EvilIdler		Ack. The Marillat repository for AMD64 is only one file now, meaning I have to build :/
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	I've googled till my fingers went numb, and all I could find was "Not yet, if ever"
2005-04-13T10:05:00.000Z	lok`		damn
2005-04-13T10:06:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	Wine and Valgrind are the two programs I'd use which are x86 only :/
2005-04-13T10:06:00.000Z	lok`		I wait win64 only for that f****** wmv and flash player
2005-04-13T10:07:00.000Z	EvilIdler	lok`	Oh, yeah. Flash would be neat. Looks like they don't care until WinXP 64 is commonplace
