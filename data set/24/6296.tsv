2006-10-05T12:04:00.000Z	devnull		my gnome-panels keep failing and locking up ... i can't figure out which applet is crashing them but i have almost no usuability in gnome without the panels ... is there anything i can do ?
2006-10-05T12:06:00.000Z	devnull		gasten no i haven't
2006-10-05T12:06:00.000Z	devnull		the only thing that is different is i have deskbar-applet on the panel but it was running fine last time the panels were working
2006-10-05T12:06:00.000Z	devnull		i have 3 panels and i can't use any of them
2006-10-05T12:08:00.000Z	devnull		plus i don't know how to remove things from the panel without having access to the panel so they all just keep getting reloaded
2006-10-05T12:10:00.000Z	devnull		i just dont know what would be fudging up the panels
2006-10-05T12:11:00.000Z	devnull		can i just remove the session file ?
2006-10-05T12:11:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	make a backup first, and try
2006-10-05T12:11:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	good idea
2006-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	and not using edgy or glx ?
2006-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	no glx
2006-10-05T12:50:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	have you installed applets outside ubuntu.com repos ? or even debs with dpkg ? or even self compiled ?
2006-10-05T12:51:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	no ... the only app i added lately was NM and deskbar-applet
2006-10-05T12:52:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	then maybe uninstalling the applets you last install... sorry, i dont know where to debug that...
2006-10-05T12:52:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	its okay ... it sounds like a good idea, i will give it a shot
2006-10-05T12:54:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	how exactly did you burn the image ? did you read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
2006-10-05T12:54:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	.... after hours it was the deskbar applet apparently
2006-10-05T12:55:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	hmm, hope it aint a bug...
2006-10-05T12:55:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	i hope not aswell .. i like deskbar applet ... it is much better than katapult
2006-10-05T12:56:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	from which repo did you install it ?
2006-10-05T12:56:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	continue to use dapper repo ? what does that mean ?
2006-10-05T12:57:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	not what i ment... could you pastebin your sources.list file ?
2006-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	devnull	oskude	... #flood
2006-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	oskude	devnull	ok
