2011-07-31T00:28:00.000Z	makara		hi. i'm having trouble with natty and 2 huawei mobile broadband devices
2011-07-31T00:29:00.000Z	makara		on 3 different machines
2011-07-31T00:29:00.000Z	makara		and 3 different service providers
2011-07-31T00:30:00.000Z	makara		why won't Natty show mobile broadband connections even when the modem flashes blue?
2011-07-31T00:31:00.000Z	makara		at what level are things going wrong?
2011-07-31T00:31:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	do the syslog show that it is recognized as a modem?
2011-07-31T00:31:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	how to access syslog?
2011-07-31T00:33:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	pull the modem out, open a terminal, type tailf /var/log/syslog and stick the modem in again - watch the messages
2011-07-31T00:38:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	it looks like it does recognize. but it wants to perform some 'Auto usb0' and it fails to connect
2011-07-31T00:38:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	that's for the huawei e153. it doesn't do this for the huawei e180
2011-07-31T00:39:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	log says DHCPv4 request timed out
2011-07-31T00:39:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	ok, one easy thing to try: open another terminal and type there:  eject sr1   -- and watch the log in the other window - I have to do that with my 3G every time (it pretends to be a CD)
2011-07-31T00:41:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	mine pretends to be both. it shows up twice in the disk utility
2011-07-31T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	when I eject the fake CD then it behaves like a modem and is treated and recognized as such by the system
2011-07-31T00:43:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	nothing happens. no complaints, nothing. can't eject from disk utility either
2011-07-31T00:44:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	there's option to 'safe removal'. should i do this?
2011-07-31T00:46:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	I never tried from the GUI, only from terminal - with    eject sr1
2011-07-31T00:47:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	what model and what firmware you got?
2011-07-31T00:48:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	its not a huawei,  (ZTE mf626), but while searching I often cam across posts with huawei problem/suggestions, they seem to be not *that* different
2011-07-31T00:49:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	it works sometimes. that's the thing. its so unpredictable
2011-07-31T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	I fear that I lead you a little astray - but if it "works sometimes" then try to look into /var/log/syslog when it does and when it doesn't so you can maybe find a reason
2011-07-31T00:51:00.000Z	makara	guntbert	no thank you. i learn about reading the logs
2011-07-31T01:01:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	please have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager/Hardware/3G  - no solutions but maybe some hints
2012-03-12T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	makara	please keep your comments here to ubuntu support only
