2007-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	walkintome		hi all, im trying to instal ndiswrapper right after a clean installation. When i try to install build essentials it tells me i need the dependancy libc6-dev, so i go to install that and it says i need libc6. i go to install that and it says i already have a newer version. What's going on then?

2007-04-25T10:17:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	that error means one of the packages depends on a specific libc6 version wich is not available on your system
2007-04-25T10:19:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	do not install a newer libc6 package !
2007-04-25T10:24:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	that ndiskrwrapper module that you are trying to compile is not compatible with your ubuntu kernel version
2007-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	did you read my message about the ndiswrapper module that you trying to build being incompatible with your kernel version ?
2007-04-25T10:28:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	it must be on the documentation or at some website, the kernel versions for which the modules is compatible with
2007-04-25T10:30:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	now i just need to figure out which version of ndiswrapper to use
2007-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	that should be easy to find on google, i guess someone id it already
2007-04-25T10:32:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	btw, there is an ndiswrapper module on Feisty
2007-04-25T10:33:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	does that mean i should already have it?
2007-04-25T10:33:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	if so, how do i use it/make sure its working
2007-04-25T10:33:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	well, i am not sure it is on the CD, it means you should grab it instead of the source
2007-04-25T10:34:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=ndiswrapper&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all
2007-04-25T10:34:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	my apologies, but i dont know what that means or how to do it
2007-04-25T10:34:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	you need to download the packages, and their dependencies
2007-04-25T10:34:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	all tthree packages you pointed me too and all their dependencies?
2007-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	yes, but note that I am just researching, i don't use ndiswrapper
2007-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	no problem. i guess im going to get started =)
2007-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	I found a better documentation
2007-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	thank you--i will have a look
2007-04-29T13:54:00.000Z	Lamego	walkintome	to install software you need to: sudo checkinstall make install
2007-04-29T13:55:00.000Z	walkintome	Lamego	when do i run sudo checkinstall and sudo make install? after the configure?
