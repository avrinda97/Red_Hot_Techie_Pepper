2007-04-15T15:30:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	your menu.lst looks correct for a single disk
2007-04-15T15:30:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	it that good
2007-04-15T15:31:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	did you perhaps setup your system to use the second disk (for, say /home) ?
2007-04-15T15:31:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	maybe, could you tell me how to check thank you.
2007-04-15T15:32:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	the file '/etc/fstab' should contain this information.  'cat /etc/fstab' will tell you
2007-04-15T15:33:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	perhaps you should just reinstall Ubuntu with only 1 hard disk connected; it shouldn't take too long
2007-04-15T15:34:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	on that page, what should i look for
2007-04-15T15:34:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	which page?
2007-04-15T15:34:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	do you mean the file /etc/fstab ?
2007-04-15T15:35:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	'cat /etc/fstab'
2007-04-15T15:35:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	look for anything that says '/dev/hdb' or '/dev/hdc' or perhaps '/dev/sda' (or sdb,sdc, etc)
2007-04-15T15:37:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	 /dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0   /dev/  /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0
2007-04-15T15:37:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	that one is OK; it's for the CD-ROM
2007-04-15T15:38:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	 # /dev/hda1 UUID=20d379b2-ab6b-4611-acff-fc8db0ecbd15 /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0
2007-04-15T15:39:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	thanks for your help
2007-04-15T15:39:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	/dev/hda entries should be OK.  The line you've quoted starts with a '#' though, which means it's ignored
2007-04-15T15:39:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	there is another set of numbers after this as well
2007-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	your menu.lst looks OK, but incomplete; there are usually other parts to that file which Ubuntu uses when upgrading the kernel
2007-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	# /dev/hda5 UUID=f5e02f3f-24ab-4d65-b758-aabd33a5fb7c none            swap    sw              0       0
2007-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	that's also /dev/hda, shouldn't matter
2007-04-15T15:42:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	also, that file is uncommented. Oh, and your 'lshw' doesn't show a /dev/hda5 partition, which is odd
2007-04-15T15:42:00.000Z	Jaso1		royrr: should I try to try to reinstall Ubuntu?
2007-04-15T15:42:00.000Z	roryy	Jaso1	i think that would be easiest
2007-04-15T15:43:00.000Z	Jaso1	roryy	 thank you roryy, i will try now and let you know.  Thank you.
