2008-05-30T18:58:00.000Z	nk_x		I'm trying to get my laptop to connect to a wireless network using a noname pcmcia card. The card shows up on lshw, but it's not in my network device list. Any idea what I might be doing wrong?
2008-05-30T19:00:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	if you do "sudo lshw -C network" what is the card/chipset? Please pastebin your results.
2008-05-30T19:01:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	I can't paste since I'm on another pc, but under product it says "88w8335 [Libertas]" and the vendor is Marvell
2008-05-30T19:02:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Well your in luck then--I know for sure that chipset works with ndiswrapper. Do you need help getting it going with ndiswrapper?
2008-05-30T19:03:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	Do you have a link to a tutorial or something like that?
2008-05-30T19:04:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	And I'd need to get the drivers somewhere first, right?
2008-05-30T19:05:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	I guess not, but I can lead you through it if you like. And yes, you need the Windows wireless drivers, but I can help with that--you have exactly the same chipset 88w8335 as I do so I could send them to you if you like.
2008-05-30T19:07:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	Yes, that'd be great!
2008-05-30T19:09:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	I probably don't have the ports forwarded to do DCC, let me see if I can find them myself
2008-05-30T19:10:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Do you have a install CD for your wireless card? That would have the drivers on it.
2008-05-30T19:10:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	I think the laptop still has a partition with WinXP on it, so they should probably be somewhere on there, right?
2008-05-30T19:11:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Hmmm, yes that's probably true, but you don't know how old they are. How about PMing me with an email address I can send it too?
2008-05-30T19:14:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	OK I sent it--you should probably have it by now.
2008-05-30T19:15:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Oh wait...
2008-05-30T19:17:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	OK that should have worked. Let me know when you get it.
2008-05-30T19:20:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	nothing so far...
2008-05-30T19:22:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	can you tell me the name of the inf file? Then I'll just check my windows installation for it
2008-05-30T19:22:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Oh brother the email bounced back at me because your gmail thinks I'm sending you an executable. Do you have any other email addresses? Or does anyone here know how to convert a bin to ascii temporarily?
2008-05-30T19:24:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	OK this is better, just go here: http://drop.io/8nizsek
2008-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Did you get it OK now?
2008-05-30T19:27:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	Yeah, I got it and already installed it with ndisgtk. Seems to work!
2008-05-30T19:28:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Excellent! Be sure to reboot and make sure it works on reboot too...
2008-05-30T19:35:00.000Z	nk_x	Steve-Cal	Looks like everything works, thanks for your help!
2008-05-30T19:35:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	nk_x	Great! Glad it's working.
