2005-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	does it set up the environment and the plugin correctly ?
2005-01-02T07:38:00.000Z	mojo	ogra	yes, more perfect! I got this way from an Debian expert
2005-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	method 2 from the wiki worked for me on about 50 installs perfectly
2005-01-02T07:39:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	personally i think its the best one
2005-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	would you add it to the wiki ?
2005-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	mojo	ogra	can't due to some PATENT Issues, you're not allowed to Debianize even Java
2005-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	mojo	ogra	so my way is better but illegal
2005-01-02T07:41:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	the instructions...not the package

2005-01-02T07:43:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	sorry, i cant imagine that anyone at canonical is upset if you add instructions
2005-01-02T07:43:00.000Z	mojo	ogra	OK then. let me try
2005-01-02T07:44:00.000Z	ogra	mojo	nice thanks....
