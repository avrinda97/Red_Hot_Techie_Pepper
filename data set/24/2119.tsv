2009-04-09T14:52:00.000Z	Chr|s		how do Lock the system by keyboard shortcut?
2009-04-09T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	ctrl+alt+l
2011-04-01T16:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	why have you called the ops
2011-04-01T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	where ?
2011-04-01T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	where ?
2011-04-01T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	doubtful
2011-04-01T23:45:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	really? how come?
2011-04-01T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	because 10.10 is a gnome 2 distro
2011-04-01T23:46:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	so there will be no way to install gnome 3 whatsoever on ubuntu
2011-04-01T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	there will be no official packages
2011-04-05T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	why would that help ?
2011-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	how would a clean install fix i/o errors ?
2011-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	told him to reformat the drive than do a clean install
2011-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	why ?
2011-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	because he is having hard drive issues read/write
2011-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	no it wasn't
2011-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	it was having I/O issues and DMA issues
2011-04-05T14:41:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	this is why I said to format the drive, write 0's to the drive. It some cases it does help.
2011-04-05T14:44:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	erasing the drive, writing 0's to the drive wipes everything, maybe there was a bad cluster of some sort
2011-04-05T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	- you're wrong here, so lets just move on, the user appears to be happy getting support on his hardware
2011-04-05T14:50:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	im not wrong, but thanks
2011-04-05T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	you are, the user has a hardware problem in 2 OS's that are DMA errors also, formatting or writing 0's to the drive will do nothing
2011-04-05T14:52:00.000Z	Chr|s	ikonia	im not going to sit here and argue with you. He also said he was having write errors. Formatting/writing 0's to the drive does work in some situations. It wouldn't of hurt to try.
2011-04-05T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Chr|s	read the errors
