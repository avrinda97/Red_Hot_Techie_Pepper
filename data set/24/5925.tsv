2006-10-10T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Skygge__,  you aont going to be doing much gaming/instaling from the live cd.. If you install the system - you can try. BUT really for the best in games for the hard-core-alcoholic-addicted gamer. i have to say stick with windows and dual boot.
2006-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Grr wrong nick. :P
2006-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis		The Steam Games/system just sort of ticked me off. :)
2006-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	you could say, it steamed you :)
2007-08-11T11:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	are the other pcs windows or linux?
2007-08-11T11:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 mixed network. all them seem to be unable to see/use the networked printer.. that they were using just a week or so ago.
2007-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	it does not.
2007-11-15T23:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	that's a fallacy, I have seen Windows machines with 16GB of RAM.
2007-11-15T23:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 ive never seen one.. and that was the excuse i heard at the store. True the guys at the store may be idiots. but
2007-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	you've never seen a machine with more than 4 GB of RAM?
2007-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 then why does linux need to be 64bit to access more then 4gb of ram? i thouhg it was all about adressing space.
2007-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 nope. Then again - i dont work for a pc company. :)
2007-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	Windows also needs to be 64 bit to access 4 GB of RAM.
2007-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 other then the ads  for 'servers' in the back of linux magazines.
2007-11-15T23:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 wasent that what i said? the main need for 64bit Linux and windows both  is to access large amounts of ram.
2007-11-15T23:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	that's not the main need; that's the most bankable one.
2007-11-15T23:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 ive yet to see  any benchmarks showing other gains.. but its like a chicken and egg thing. :)
2007-11-15T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 at the end . he makes a 3rd Konsole and uses the exoported variable from the first one.
2007-11-15T23:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	by the way, that export 'trick' in the video? Its a Konsole "feature".
2007-11-15T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 ok. If you say so, :) ive never noticed it befor.
2007-11-15T23:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	I installed console -- basically its the difference between a 'session' and a 'window'.
2007-11-16T00:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 ahhh...   a session is a clone of a existing shell i guess.
2007-11-16T00:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Dr_willis	you got it ;)
2007-11-16T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fyrestrtr	 i will mess with it at work. :)
