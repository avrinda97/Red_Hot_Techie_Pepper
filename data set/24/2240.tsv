2009-08-12T02:55:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	are you burning the .iso as an image or data cd?
2009-08-12T02:56:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	when you put the cd in, what happens?
2009-08-12T02:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	if the disk was burned correctly then it will be readable on an computer
2009-08-12T02:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	thats sort of the point
2009-08-12T03:00:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	I've tried with two different iso's with two different operating systems (burned in mac and ubuntu) and neither disk can be read in Vista. Both can be read in Mac
2009-08-12T03:03:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	very odd problem you have there.. what can i say.. its Vista :p  Your best bet is to go to the Win/Vista support sites/chans, as this sounds like a vista prob if both linux and mac can read them?
2009-08-12T03:07:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	so vista wants nothing to do with ubuntu is what you're saying?
2009-08-12T03:07:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	:) i guess.
2009-08-12T03:09:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	im afraid we cant really support problems with other OS's in here. maybe if you keep asking someone will have an answer for you.. but idk man.. sry
2009-08-12T03:10:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	again, I'm just trying to install ubuntu... I have to do it from USB stick bc either my BIOS is lame and won't read the cd or the disk is lame and can't be read.  In either case, I have a USB stick version created from within ubuntu from the latest 9.04 iso. The issue now is that the USB stick installation is being lame.  FOrget Vista
2009-08-12T03:11:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	are you trying to overwrite vista with Ubuntu?
2009-08-12T03:12:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	yes
2009-08-12T03:13:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	in that case id suggest using a tool like Gparted to wipe your drive, which may solve some of your booting issues
2009-08-12T03:13:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	also, make sure that your bios supports booting from USB, as older machines tend not to
2009-08-12T03:14:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	like i said, i can boot from usb just fine.  I'd love to use gparted, but i can't install ubuntu and I can't run it either
2009-08-12T03:14:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	you can get a livecd version of gparted (just google for it)
2009-08-12T03:15:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	the issue before was that the BIOS wouldn't boot from cd.  Hence the need for using USB
2009-08-12T03:18:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	so do you need help setting up a bootable usb then?
2009-08-12T03:18:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	no, i have one already.  I'm getting ext2-fs errors when trying to using it
2009-08-12T03:19:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	did you try and remake the usb to make sure that it isnt corrupted?
2009-08-12T03:19:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	someone said previously that means my hd is hosed.  I don't think that's the case cause it happens when trying to run ubuntu (not install it) which doesn't reformat
2009-08-12T03:19:00.000Z	wjb	b3rz3rk3r	no, i haven't tried that
2009-08-12T03:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	give that a go first to ensure that isnt the cause of your issues..
2009-08-12T03:20:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	wjb	if it happens again then we know thats its a hardware error rather than corrupt usb install
