2007-10-26T16:47:00.000Z	gunspoja		gday everyone
2007-10-26T16:47:00.000Z	gunspoja		hows the 7.10 release going?
2007-10-26T16:47:00.000Z	gunspoja		is it an awesome improvement?
2007-10-26T16:48:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	yes it is :)
2007-10-26T16:57:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	i would suggest a clean install, its better in all ways :)
2007-10-26T16:49:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	ntfs-reading, power-saving, compiz-fusion, wifi support (WPA and WPA2)
2007-10-26T16:50:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	yup, and with ntfs reading
2007-10-26T16:50:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	and writing ofc
2007-10-26T16:51:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	and writing? did it all work out of the box?
2007-10-26T16:53:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	although there is no ubuntu box :P
2007-10-26T16:54:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	all my hardware worked out of the box with ubuntu 7.10 (except for my ATI card, but restricted driver manager is easy hehe)
2007-10-26T16:54:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	7.10 gives new plug&play printer support
2007-10-26T16:55:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	my EPSON printer worked immediately hehe
2007-10-26T16:55:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	upgrading from feisty to edgy isnt really smart though hehe better from feisty to gutsy
2007-10-26T16:55:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	but i did a clean install.. that worked great
2007-10-26T16:56:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	then upgrade from feisty :P
2007-10-26T16:58:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	7.04 was the biggest surprise for me: WOW my tv tuner card works out of the box :P
2007-10-26T16:59:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	in belgium, ubuntu-be does a lot of marketing
2007-10-26T17:00:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	like spreading CD's and being on computer events
2007-10-26T17:00:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	we should make some money for a ubuntu advertisement in the new york times :')
2007-10-26T17:01:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	thats something different.. for installing ubuntu, you have to be quite advanced with computers.
2007-10-26T17:03:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	but everyone can buy an ubuntu computer from dell
2007-10-26T17:03:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	though i think getting some OEM manufactors is better for marketing
2007-10-26T17:04:00.000Z	deadheron	gunspoja	i hear the voices: "whats an ISO"
