2012-09-10T23:54:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		I have a 32 GB SSD and 500 GB HD In my laptop, what is the best way to install ubuntu?
2012-09-10T23:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	define "best"   and maybe folks can help further
2012-09-10T23:55:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		I want to use SSD to load my system and maybe some applications, but HDD for everything else
2012-09-10T23:56:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		Probably just system loaded by SSD for now
2012-09-10T23:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	than I guess just install to the SSD, and setup the HDD as /home
2012-09-10T23:56:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		How do I do that?
2012-09-10T23:57:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		I anticipate I will have at least 50 GB of applications
2012-09-10T23:57:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		so I don't know if that is a good setup
2012-09-10T23:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	when it comes time to partition (during the installation process), ask to do, wait what?
2012-09-10T23:57:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	50GB of apps?  what apps?  are these games?
2012-09-10T23:58:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		yes games and development tools
2012-09-10T23:58:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		like Quartus
2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z	LibertyTrader	ChogyDan	do you see why I am concerned?
2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	well, I don't know.  Maybe maybe you could have all the app files mounted to the HDD?
2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	I do, but 50GB is a HUGE amount of apps
2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	unless its games, so... it's just unexpected
2012-09-11T00:01:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		And my system is UEFI...
2012-09-11T00:01:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		I'm in for a trat...
2012-09-11T00:01:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		I bought a nice shiny ultrabook that used the SSD as a cache to 500 GB HD
2012-09-11T00:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	maybe dual boot, one for regular use, and one for all those games.
2012-09-11T00:01:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		But linux doesn't support that
2012-09-11T00:04:00.000Z	LibertyTrader		Is there a way I can just put the kernel and boot stuff on the SSD?
2012-09-11T00:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	maybe by mounting /boot to ssd, but I don't think that will garner you much performance benefit
2012-09-11T00:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan	LibertyTrader	in fact, the HDD might be faster for that...
