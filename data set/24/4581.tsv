2007-03-04T15:24:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		I am running ubuntu 6.10 and have two different wireless cards that I can use
2007-03-04T15:24:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		I know the name and pswd for my wireless modem
2007-03-04T15:24:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		and enter them into the wireless profiles for each card
2007-03-04T15:25:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		(one at a time, or together, it makes no difference)
2007-03-04T15:25:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		despite ubuntu recognizing that I have wireless cards, I can not access the network
2007-03-04T15:25:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		there is nothing to block people accessing the network
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		and my other operating systems on the computer can use those cards to access it
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		can I get it without having ubuntu attached to the internet
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		?
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r		(like a seperate download that I can get with windows?)
2007-03-04T15:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	and get the right version for your Ubuntu ( the edgy or dapper one etc)
2007-03-04T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	read the docs ubotu posted
2007-03-04T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	and come back with more specific questions if needed :)
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	try emoving the configurations, and install network-manager-gnome
2007-03-04T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	ah, catch 22
2007-03-04T15:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	yes, try packages.ubuntu.com
2007-03-04T15:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	make sure you get the dependencies as well ( network-manager and nm-applet I think)
2007-03-04T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	6.10 is edgy eft
2007-03-04T15:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	the main issue with wireless in Linux is drivers - some are not supported although ndiswrapper might help
2007-03-04T15:36:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	thoreauputic	how can I test ndiswrapper and what can it do?
2007-03-04T15:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	it basically acts as a linux wrapper for windows drivers
2007-03-04T15:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	I suggest that you read the wifi wiki docs
2007-03-04T15:37:00.000Z	st0n3cutt3r	thoreauputic	any of them? all of them?
2007-03-04T15:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	st0n3cutt3r	first find out if your chipset is supported or not :)
