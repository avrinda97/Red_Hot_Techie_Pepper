2011-01-17T10:56:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	cron is installed by default
2011-01-17T10:57:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	anacron runs missed crons
2011-01-17T10:58:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	i want the cron to run when my machine is on and then trn off with the machine and then work only when my machine is restareted i dont want it to work on the missed ones
2011-01-17T10:59:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	if you add it */5 it will run every 5 minutes when computer is on
2011-01-17T10:59:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	ok cool
2011-01-17T11:06:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	i used the terminal to write a cron but as soon as i close the terminal the cron folder and file get removed from my /tmp folder
2011-01-17T11:06:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	you edit cron with crontab -e -command
2011-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	i wont be able to see the file yet the cron will run ?
2011-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	or you write it somewhere and upload it to crontab with file
2011-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	what does crontab -l say?
2011-01-17T11:07:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	it shows the cron i set
2011-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	well then it's ok
2011-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	ok thanks
2011-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	it's safer to edit crontab with crontab -e because it also tells you if your cron is not properly made
2011-01-17T11:08:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	ok
2011-01-17T11:10:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	i had set a cron for /var/www/index.php so i should do crontab -e /var/www/index.php to edit it ?
2011-01-17T11:12:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	nvm i got it, thanks for your help
2011-01-17T11:13:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	ok :)
2011-01-17T11:14:00.000Z	ruby_on_tails	gobbe	*/1 * * * /var/www/index.php will this run the script evey minute ? coz the script aint running :(
2011-01-17T11:15:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	it runs it every one minute, check from logs what happened. I would say that you need to run it with php-command
2011-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	and you are missing one *
2011-01-17T11:16:00.000Z	gobbe	ruby_on_tails	*/1 * * * * something
