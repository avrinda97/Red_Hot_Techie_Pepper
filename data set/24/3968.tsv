2007-08-17T14:18:00.000Z	nick108		Hi there, I've remotely installed a minimal image of Ubuntu and would like to install a windows manager with apt-get
2007-08-17T14:19:00.000Z	nick108		can someone please point me into the right direction?
2007-08-17T14:19:00.000Z	nick108		anyone here using Ubuntu as a webserver, remotely?
2007-08-17T14:20:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	yes, why?
2007-08-17T14:22:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	I'm trying to install a windows manager remotely and then login via VNC client
2007-08-17T14:22:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	how do I install a windows manager on a minimal ubuntu system
2007-08-17T14:23:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	via remote, i.e. via Putty (apt-get?)
2007-08-17T14:23:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	Are you sure you want a window manager on a server?
2007-08-17T14:23:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	yes, I need to run a Java application that creates statistics
2007-08-17T14:23:00.000Z	NMajik		nick108:Oh, ok then
2007-08-17T14:24:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	Is http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=186298&page=2 helpful?
2007-08-17T14:25:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	that's perfect!
2007-08-17T14:25:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	and then from there remote desktop allows you to control it with VNC
2007-08-17T14:26:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	have you done something similar yourself already?
2007-08-17T14:27:00.000Z	NMajik		nick108:Yes, but just on a whim. I don't actually need a webserver
2007-08-17T14:27:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	I mean on a remote machine?
2007-08-17T14:28:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	yeah
2007-08-17T14:29:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	after having installed the windows manager how do I proceed? Simply connecting with a VNC client?
2007-08-17T14:29:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	locally this didn't work
2007-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	I always had to login locally first and configure it
2007-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	then I could also login via VNC client
2007-08-17T14:30:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	Oh, I'm very sorry, I guess I misunderstood
2007-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	NMajik	nick108	I don't know how to do that remotely
2007-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	nick108	NMajik	thanks anyway for the usefull link to the forums!
