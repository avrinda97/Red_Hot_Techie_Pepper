2011-08-22T04:50:00.000Z	aadsdas8		I have a problem: my laptop is overheating
2011-08-22T04:50:00.000Z	aadsdas8		and fan is making a lot of noise lol
2011-08-22T04:51:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	that sounds like a hardware issue..
2011-08-22T04:51:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	new laptops ship w/ problems also.
2011-08-22T04:51:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	in windblowz it doesnt make noise
2011-08-22T04:51:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	dunnno, sounds like you got somethin going on there.
2011-08-22T04:52:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	thats vague
2011-08-22T04:52:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	well, you gave a vague explanation of the probl_em.
2011-08-22T04:53:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	what model laptop?
2011-08-22T04:53:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	toshiba satellite l650
2011-08-22T05:00:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	i thnk the bigger questino, is why doesn't toshiba have toshiba tools for linux.. you're blaming the wrong party
2011-08-22T05:01:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	I installed toshiba tools from repositorie.s.
2011-08-22T05:02:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	it doesnt work with this kernel
2011-08-22T05:02:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	then that still isn't ubuntu's problem, toshiba needs to do a better job of making sure their package works w/ all kernels
2011-08-22T05:03:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	actually, that would be pretty smart, a bad fan will brick a laptop very very quickly.
2011-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	did you configure toshiba tools?
2011-08-22T05:04:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	the fan is working correctly as seen in windows 7. it is not working correctly in ubuntu 11.04. conclusion: it's ubuntu fault
2011-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	i'm not gonna talk to someone who has drawn such a dense conclusion, but... ok.
2011-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	lack of arguments but ok
2011-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	no, the argument is, you don't know how to read, did you read this little tidbit ont hat package...  Note that these utilities work with APM features in the Toshiba BIOS.
2011-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	anyway, so that is obvbiously ubuntus' fault, since they told you a package probably woudln't know w/ your laptop...
2011-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	well, like i said, remove it.
2011-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	aadsdas8	KM0201	dont call me an idiot, idiot
2011-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	KM0201	aadsdas8	i can read wha ta package does and doesn't do... you obviously cannot.
