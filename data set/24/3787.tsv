2012-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	awolf		How do I change my home folder permissions so I can get it working again?
2012-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	awolf		I'm in command line
2012-10-19T09:59:00.000Z	awolf		I think just the permissions
2012-10-19T10:00:00.000Z	awolf		ls: cannot access home/aaron/aaron: Permission denied
2012-10-19T10:00:00.000Z	awolf		!!
2012-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	awolf		I should do it with sudo maybe?
2012-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	awolf		Oh ok
2012-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	awolf		got it
2012-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	awolf		un momento
2012-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	awolf		drw-r--r-- 4 root root 4096 Oct 19 01:29 aaron
2012-10-19T10:05:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	what did you do to your /home directory?
2012-10-19T10:06:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	you need to chmod your /home
2012-10-19T10:08:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	you also need to make sure /home/aaron is owned by you but /ome is owned by root still
2012-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	way I have overcome the problem is just back up your /home directory and then delete it from the /home and then log back in again. The system should recreate your home directory
2012-10-19T10:11:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	I always drop to a console and log out of graphical mode and then copy all the files in my $HOME to another drive. Then all your permissions are preserved. Rough I know, but it works :)
2012-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	you need to log in as yourself in a console (ctrl + alt + f1)
2012-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	then copy all your files to elsewhere, then delete /home/aaron
2012-10-19T10:15:00.000Z	awolf	Mechdave	thanks for the help. I'm logging back in
2012-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	now you can start copying files back again, checking permissions as you go :)
2012-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	type echo $HOME in a console and paste what it says
2012-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	ok now log in as root, mkdir /home/aaron
2012-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	then chown -R aaron:aaron /home/aaron
2012-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	did you back up and delete the original /home/aaron directory?
2012-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	Mechdave	awolf	you need to do that
