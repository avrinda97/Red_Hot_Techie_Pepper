2009-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	tzanger		good morning
2009-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	tzanger		apparently there is more to kubuntu than "apt-get install kde" from ubuntu... do I really have to download the kubunutu CD, or is there a special virtual package I'm missing that gives me things like knetworkmanager and konsole?
2009-04-26T12:57:00.000Z	tzanger		apt-get install kde gave me almost everything
2009-04-26T12:59:00.000Z	tzanger		waiting for botle to cool a little for the baby
2009-04-26T13:00:00.000Z	tzanger		200MB of packages on top of KDE, wow
2009-04-26T13:01:00.000Z	tzanger		so the only difference between ubuntu and kubuntu is the gnome-desktop installed by default vs kde-esktop package?
2009-04-26T13:01:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	pretty much so
2009-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	it's the pretty much that worries me :-)
2009-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	well, kubuntu is "just" ubuntu with KDE (and all the packages such as qt, kde, libs, etc.)
2009-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	can help momentarily. feeding baby
2009-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	thanks...waiting of course
2009-04-26T13:06:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	cheers to the baby...;)
2009-04-26T13:14:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	ok there we go
2009-04-26T13:15:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	thanks. I love they way that they kind of "drop off" like full little grubs when they're full
2009-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	I have a copy of 40-permissions.rules from my old 7.10 install, I can guide you through making a rule (I teach linux familiarization and device drivers) or I can just make that file available
2009-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	well, I still can wait...I am not that much of a "I need a baby myself"...:)
2009-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	hahaha
2009-04-26T13:17:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	thanks a lot...however, I managed to do that already (used a file or part of it from 8.04)...but it did not help
2009-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	tzanger	sandra_ch	ok, well let's do it the hard way then. What is the device you're trying to match?
2009-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	the ebanking software still says that those udev changes need to be made...I get the feeling that this file is not read by udev for some reasons
2009-04-26T13:18:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	good question, let me check
2009-04-26T13:19:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	probably this "[KOBIL Systems mIDentity XL]"
2009-04-26T13:25:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	probably this "[KOBIL Systems mIDentity XL]", at least that is what messages tells me
2009-04-26T13:30:00.000Z	sandra_ch	tzanger	I guess there is another file for udev to change that usb behaviour...the 40-basic-ruleset is not used (in jaunty /etc/udev/rules.d is rather empty)
