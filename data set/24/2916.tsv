2009-11-20T12:01:00.000Z	`Immortal`		shouldn't Ubuntu prompt me to upgrade when i insert the 9.10 disk?
2009-11-20T12:02:00.000Z	kostkon	`Immortal`	you can only upgrade using the alternate cd. which one do you have?
2009-11-20T12:02:00.000Z	`Immortal`		Hmm

2009-11-20T12:04:00.000Z	kostkon	`Immortal`	then it seems you have the live cd. you can't upgrade with that

2009-11-20T12:04:00.000Z	`Immortal`		bummer

2009-11-20T12:05:00.000Z	`Immortal`		and clean install would be painful
2009-11-20T12:05:00.000Z	`Immortal`		as i have lot of apps installed
2009-11-20T12:06:00.000Z	`Immortal`		any idea how many MB an upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 takes?
2009-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	`Immortal`		If i Upgrade via web well i get an estimate size?
2009-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	`Immortal`		and can i cancel mid-way?
2009-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	kostkon	`Immortal`	you can a estimated size yes. you can pause the download and continue it some other time.
