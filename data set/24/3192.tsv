2008-04-03T21:51:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	what does lspci say about that card (just one line)
2008-04-03T21:54:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	bazhang, it says Broadcom Corporation BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n (rev 03)

2012-04-14T12:57:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	try vlc and mplayer yet?
2012-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	try mplayer or vlc yet? those are not totem
2012-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	please wait.. I have to re-install vlc because the upgrade to 11.10 deleted them from my system
2012-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	greenit - VLC works, but that doesn't help me - my remote does not work with VLC
2012-04-14T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	what about mplayer
2012-04-14T14:22:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	I tried sudo apt-get install mplayer but I can't find anyway to start it. there is no icon under applications
2012-04-14T14:23:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	what about alt f2 mplayer to launch it
2012-04-14T14:24:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	in the alt f2 window?
2012-04-14T14:26:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	ok.. mplayer plays video
2012-04-14T14:26:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	why not use mplayer then
2012-04-14T14:27:00.000Z	dalek_	bazhang	I will have to now, but it is a pain to have to launch videos from the command line
2012-04-14T14:33:00.000Z	bazhang	dalek_	sounds like a bug; file one and check launchpad for same
