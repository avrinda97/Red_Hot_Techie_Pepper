2009-05-12T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	I just did one of these a little while ago
2009-05-12T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	rather common issue, with an easy fix
2009-05-12T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	oh you missed my reply or?
2009-05-12T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	I see ok
2009-05-12T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	I am finding it hard to follow,  probably  better to try in here again, rather than pm
2009-05-12T23:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	your  English is ok, but  you may find a channel in your own langauge more useful
2009-05-12T23:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	ok
2009-05-12T23:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	so  the main issue is that you found the  Grub restoring instructions hard to follow, since your new to Ubuntu?
2009-05-12T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	which installation CD?
2009-05-12T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	since Ubuntu 7.10 or something    the  Live CD is also the installation CD
2009-05-12T23:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	which version of Ubuntu?
2009-05-12T23:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	no for Ubuntu 8.04 it's both,  unless you got the  text only alternate CD
2009-05-12T23:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	well you need to  mount your partition  on Live CD and run Grub restoring commands or something
2009-05-12T23:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	need to make sure it's working on your install
2009-05-12T23:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	always good idea to md5sum ISO's for CD's that are downloaded by the way
2009-05-12T23:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	before burning
2009-05-12T23:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	it sounds like to me, that your using some weird live cd
2009-05-12T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	backtrack ah yes that one
2009-05-12T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	that's not really for  this kind of thing in the first place
2009-05-12T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	Ubuntu Live CD that's what you want
2009-05-12T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matr|x	backtrack is a  security  stuff and that CD,  not tested it yet.   it's not really for Grub issues.     so  yeah  Ubuntu Live CD or   supergrub cd
