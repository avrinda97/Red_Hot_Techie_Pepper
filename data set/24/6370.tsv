2007-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	does your password work when you log in via ssh?
2007-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: yes.
2007-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: i am using feisty fawn. i am on the machine at the moment which is giving me issues. my vnc authentication password is different from my ssh password.
2007-06-22T11:36:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	are you trying to connect to your X desktop, or are you running a separate vnc server?
2007-06-22T11:37:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: it used to work fine until a few days ago. i am only using the server process which comes under system > prefs > remote desktop
2007-06-22T11:37:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: it works fine if i remove the checkbox for having the user enter a password
2007-06-22T11:38:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	have you tried with a vnc password that consists only of alphanumeric characters (ie. no special characters)?
2007-06-22T11:38:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: i use plain letters
2007-06-22T11:39:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: i browsed the forums, seems it was a bug in edgy https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/65795
2007-06-22T11:41:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	I'll boot my feisty machine (on edgy at the moment) and see if I can reproduce it.
2007-06-22T11:41:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: thanks mate.
2007-06-22T11:44:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	it works here. Which client are you using?
2007-06-22T11:45:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: like i said, its worked fine forever now. just started acting funny about two or three days ago. refuses to authenticate me anymore. i'm using terminal server on the local machine. tightvnc from other clients.
2007-06-22T11:45:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: it seems when i changed passwords, its been acting up
2007-06-22T11:46:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	this is my output from gconf.xml http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26758/
2007-06-22T11:49:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	compare with mine: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26759/
2007-06-22T11:50:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: what is mtime?
2007-06-22T11:50:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	modification time, I suppose
2007-06-22T11:51:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	: i'm gonna replace your settings with mine and see if it helps.
2007-06-22T11:51:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	okay... but I cannot see a reason why it would
2007-06-22T11:54:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	it seems that i can connect from localhost
2007-06-22T11:54:00.000Z	Halai	soundray	do you mind if i message you and you try connecting from your side?
2007-06-22T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	Halai	go ahead
