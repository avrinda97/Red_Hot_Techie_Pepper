2010-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	chetnick		man, this is pissing me off. I still cant get my sound to work after hibernation.
2010-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	chetnick		come on good smart people, get together and help me out :-)
2010-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	chetnick		the worst thing is, i never use hibernation, i clicked it by mistake.
2010-04-02T11:53:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	try running this: sudo alsa force-reload
2010-04-02T11:54:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	i already tried that. I rebooted computer, tried different kernel ver... still nothing.
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	have you ran alsamixer to check if they were muted, i have forgotten to check this a few times
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	there is some pulseoudio setting somewhere that got corupted when hibernated. And i cant figure it out.
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	yes, several times.
2010-04-02T11:55:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	is pulseaudio seeing your hardware?
2010-04-02T11:57:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	pulseoudio or my system? When i open pavucontrol and play some music, the sound bar is moving, so it looks like it is recognized, it just does not give any output.
2010-04-02T11:57:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	kernel moudule/driver loaded i check with lspci -k.
2010-04-02T11:58:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	install padevchooser and that should tell you if it is connecting to a sound device or /dev/null
2010-04-02T11:58:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	i have it already, let me fire it up.
2010-04-02T11:59:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	connection refused.
2010-04-02T11:59:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	sounds like pulseaudio isn't running
2010-04-02T12:00:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	hold up, i might killed it when trying to fix it.
2010-04-02T12:01:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	ok, restarted pulseaudio, it is connected. (C-Media CMI8770 PCI)
2010-04-02T12:06:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	are you still there?
2010-04-02T12:06:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	yeah.
2010-04-02T12:07:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	yeah, i did. and volume meter shows activity, i hear no sound.
2010-04-02T12:08:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	yes, master and PCM are all unmuted and up to max.
2010-04-02T12:11:00.000Z	stevecam	chetnick	i dont know
2010-04-02T12:13:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	do you think completely reinstalling pulseaudio might help?
2010-04-02T12:21:00.000Z	chetnick	stevecam	i'll go and add another user, and see what happens there.
