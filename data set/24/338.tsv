2011-11-11T08:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	BrianXP7_	there seems to be a few solutions to try, here. Try that first.
2011-11-11T08:01:00.000Z	BrianXP7_		thanks
2011-11-11T08:03:00.000Z	BrianXP7_	apwbdjp	does reverting that driver in natty back to 2.4 work?
2011-11-11T08:04:00.000Z	apwbdjp	BrianXP7_	I have no idea. Come on, you're a Linux user, you should learn to try things yourself.
2011-11-11T08:04:00.000Z	BrianXP7_	apwbdjp	i'm a 13-year-old linux user who knows how to use aptitude
2011-11-11T08:05:00.000Z	apwbdjp	BrianXP7_	we all started like that. You're a brain connected to the internet, you can learn how to do anything ^^
2011-11-11T08:06:00.000Z	BrianXP7_	apwbdjp	k i'll try that
