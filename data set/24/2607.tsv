2011-02-19T22:30:00.000Z	SpudDogg		oh dear...i'm about to run an XP virtual machine because i cannot seem to RDP into my work computer any other way...anyone have a way that will work to RDP from ubuntu to windoze 7?
2011-02-19T22:30:00.000Z	SpudDogg		terminal server client won't connect
2011-02-19T22:30:00.000Z	SpudDogg		just tells me connection reset by peer
2011-02-19T22:31:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	its prob the firewall on the Winblows 7 pc blocking it
2011-02-19T22:31:00.000Z	SpudDogg		nah, i can connect from other windows machines
2011-02-19T22:32:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	what version OS you running (linux)
2011-02-19T22:32:00.000Z	SpudDogg		10.10
2011-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	are you trying to connect via IP or DNS?
2011-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	tried both ways
2011-02-19T22:33:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	everything else network related works on Ubuntu?
2011-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 yes, in fact i can even mount a share on that doze7 computer...
2011-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	did you select RDP or RDPv5?
2011-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 i think it has something to do with the fact that it's a computer on my work's domain.  tried both RDP versions
2011-02-19T22:35:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	are you trying to RDP via a VPN connection or anything?
2011-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 the win7 machine is connected to openvpn, but it's on my local network.  im trying to connect via my subnet
2011-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 meaning the machine is physically here, has a local IP, but also is on work's domain
2011-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	SpudDogg		err VPN
2011-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	run nmap -v <ip of windows pc>
2011-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 think i have it
2011-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 one sec
2011-02-19T22:39:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	Get it working?
2011-02-19T22:40:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 laptop was set to require network level authentication.  when i turned that off it worked perfectly.  facepalm @ me
2011-02-19T22:40:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Code_Bleu	 thanks for the help though :)
2011-02-19T22:40:00.000Z	Code_Bleu	SpudDogg	good deal, np
