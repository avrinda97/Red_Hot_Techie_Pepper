2006-05-23T05:11:00.000Z	mynimal		I'm having some problems with running make, make install. I'm under Dapper, and I have make installed. It works sometimes, but most of the time it doesn't, even when the documentation says to use it. Basically, I've got a Makefile.am and a Makefile.in, but no makefile - I looked them up and they're a split Makefile or something?
2006-05-23T05:11:00.000Z	mynimal		I have,
2006-05-23T05:12:00.000Z	mynimal		It leaves me with those two files (and everything else of course) but no regular Makefile
2006-05-23T05:12:00.000Z	mynimal		Nope, I looked
2006-05-23T05:12:00.000Z	mynimal		I'm installing GTK+ 2.8.17
2006-05-23T05:13:00.000Z	mynimal		It just said no makefile found, :P
2006-05-23T05:14:00.000Z	mynimal		No, it's throughout many apps.
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	mynimal		I've got: makefile.msc, Makefile.am, Makefile.in
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	mynimal		Mind if I paste?
2006-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	mynimal		FOur lines.

2006-05-25T14:30:00.000Z	mynimal	ompaul	yep.

2006-05-25T14:41:00.000Z	ompaul	mynimal	grep -R _CFLAG *  | less << produces lots of output from that programs source for Ubuntu but if I stick an m in front of that underscore there is no such beast
