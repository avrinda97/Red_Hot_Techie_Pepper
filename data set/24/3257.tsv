2008-03-19T10:54:00.000Z	Kennster		Does anyone know why I might have the Ubuntu installer randomly hang right after the boot option screen?  I have a d975xbx motherboard and an nvidia 8800gt.  It just goes blank screen forever.  If I ctrl alt delete it, it runs through a big long shutdown sequence and ejects the disk.  Trying to abandon M$ here and having a hard time with it.
2008-03-19T10:55:00.000Z	Kennster		no, it's my own creation.  Would you like a hardware list?
2008-03-19T10:57:00.000Z	Kennster		Doesn't even make it to the hard drive selection interface.  Almost like it dies right where a gui *should* pop up... But I'm scared of a text based install.
2008-03-19T10:57:00.000Z	Kennster		I'm trying to dual boot on separate hard drives and can't accomplish that with fedora
2008-03-19T10:58:00.000Z	Kennster		It does the same thing when I only have one hard drive installed as well.  They are SATA.  Does that have any bearing on this?
2008-03-19T10:59:00.000Z	Kennster		Fedora installed with just one disk installed, but when I put the other in I have to switch the disk boot order in the BIOS rather than through a bootloader
2008-03-19T11:00:00.000Z	Kennster		If I attempt a repair of the fedora install it tries to initialize both drives in a single striping raid array.  Yes, I currently have 2 os's.  XP32 and fedora 64
2008-03-19T11:02:00.000Z	Carenthalas	Kennster	I have XP on primary HDD, and Mandriva w/ GRUB of secondary HDD. No problem.
2008-03-19T11:03:00.000Z	Kennster		320 advertised gigs.  So whatever that is minus the thrown away powers of 2
2008-03-19T11:04:00.000Z	Kennster		I want to nuke fedora.
2008-03-19T11:05:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado-> I want fedora deaddified.  Gone.  Destroyed.
2008-03-19T11:08:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->I don't get that far.  The installer goes blank screened right after I tell it to "install or run Ubuntu"
2008-03-19T11:10:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->LiveCd
2008-03-19T11:11:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->I'm a bit leery of the alternate install cd because I am totally new to linux and want the security of the gui installer so I know I'm not killing my existing windows drive
2008-03-19T11:12:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->just type "acpi=off" as the boot parameter?
2008-03-19T11:13:00.000Z	Kennster		They are identical model numbers and size.  It would suck to accidentally overwrite my xp
2008-03-19T11:14:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->Yes
2008-03-19T11:14:00.000Z	Carenthalas	Kennster	check carefully the device name on control panel before you do any partitioning.
2008-03-19T11:14:00.000Z	Kennster		amenado->but then my danged linux bootloader doesn't work and I have to choose hd's through the bios...  I'll just have to be careful.
2008-03-19T11:17:00.000Z	Carenthalas	Kennster	Suggest you to clone the XP drive first.
2008-03-19T11:18:00.000Z	Kennster	souper	I don't get that far is what's stopping me.  The installer hangs right after the cd's boot menu
2008-03-19T11:19:00.000Z	Kennster	souper	It's all good
2008-03-19T11:20:00.000Z	Kennster		Has nobody had their Ubuntu LiveCD 7.10 hang right after the boot menu?
2008-03-19T11:21:00.000Z	Carenthalas	Kennster	I had experienced it became black screen however it is still running.
