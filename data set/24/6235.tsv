2005-12-03T17:56:00.000Z	KK		works fine in windoze
2005-12-03T17:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	I suppose you don't need to enable it. What are you trying to do exactly? Do you have multichannel speaker system?
2005-12-03T06:00:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	Then this is not about multi channel support. Go to meny System->Preferences->Multimedia Systems Selector and select alsa instead of OSS or ESD
2005-12-03T06:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	ALSA is 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture', a sound framework providing sharing of sound card between applications, and drivers are also quite good.
2005-12-03T06:03:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	when im trying to test..im gettin an error that construction of pipeline for alsa has failed
2005-12-03T06:03:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	Since you first launched gaim hwich uses default sound system, that is ED in most cases, it blocked sound card.
2005-12-03T06:04:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	One more thing. Go to terminal and type command 'killall esd'. Also disable sound server startup from Preferences->Sound menu.
2005-12-03T06:05:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	: why ??
2005-12-03T06:06:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	im not gettin sounds on gaim when xmms is being played
2005-12-03T06:07:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	ESD blocks your sound card. There is some workaround, But I don't know about it.
2005-12-03T06:07:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	how to get to know abt it ??
2005-12-03T06:08:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	'man esd' perhaps
2005-12-03T06:08:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	i did what u asked me to do
2005-12-03T06:08:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	killall esd and disable sound server startup...
2005-12-03T06:08:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	what effect does that have ??
2005-12-03T06:09:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	It stops ESD daemon. You may try restarting GAIM.
2005-12-03T06:17:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	What is output plugin in xmms?
2005-12-03T06:18:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	oss
2005-12-03T06:18:00.000Z	onkarshinde	KK	Try changing to ALSA
2005-12-03T06:19:00.000Z	KK	onkarshinde	wow!! working!!
