2008-05-28T00:17:00.000Z	k33qk		i have a small prblm regarding SQUID Permissions based on user login
2008-05-28T00:18:00.000Z	k33qk		Atour firm,Users are allowed internet access, but to prevent taking source code out of the company, all mails sites, chat sites, File sharing sites and P2P sites are blocked through squid
2008-05-28T00:18:00.000Z	k33qk		This is done through ACLs in squid and this thing is working very fine. Server has no proxy set, so all sites are accessible in the server. Machines over the LAN are connected to this squid server, and hence, all the above said sites and job search sites are disabled.
2008-05-28T00:19:00.000Z	k33qk		the problem with it is now
2008-05-28T00:19:00.000Z	k33qk		Some users do need to access gmail or orkut for any genuine purpose, or the work allotted to him is over, so they can do whatever they want. In this case, the present solution is remove that IP address from the ACL and restart squid. This is not a good solution as a network administrator needs to sit with this all the time. Moreover, the user has still access to the source code and the risk still exists. (Or the files needed to be moved from the system befor
2008-05-28T00:19:00.000Z	k33qk		e allowing these sites, which is not fair and practical).
2008-05-28T00:21:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	sounds like you should setup a couple of "open computers" for people to do their gmail, orkut and whatever
2008-05-28T00:22:00.000Z	k33qk	Slart	:other than that
2008-05-28T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	you want a proxy that can be disabled whenever the user wants to? then why have a proxy at all?
2008-05-28T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	or you want to be able to allow a user to bypass the restrictions when the network admin says it's alright?
2008-05-28T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	I still think setting up some kind of internet-enabled public computer is the way to go
2008-05-28T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	or find a proxy that doesn't have to be restarted to change settings
2008-05-28T00:27:00.000Z	k33qk	Slart	:can u explain it ?
2008-05-28T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	I don't have any solutions for you.. I'm just bouncing ideas
2008-05-28T00:29:00.000Z	k33qk	Slart	:how about this?All users get only allowed sites. However, if they need access to mail sites, they should logout and login as guest. Guests can access all sites without any ACL restrictions. Guest account normally does not have access to home folder of other users or to /var/www, so that he can email the source code
2008-05-28T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	that might work..
2008-05-28T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	they can put source code on a USB-stick and take it home.. right?
2008-05-28T00:31:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	can they boot from a cd?
2008-05-28T00:32:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	bring a laptop to work and connect it to the network?
2008-05-28T00:34:00.000Z	k33qk	Slart	im sorry
2008-05-28T00:34:00.000Z	k33qk	Slart	:if the company cannot afford to provide a laptop?
2008-05-28T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	I meant.. what if a user brings a private laptop to work and connects it to the network?
2008-05-28T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	well.. back to the /tmp folder.. you could always have a separate /tmp folder for the guest
2008-05-28T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	k33qk	I don't really know.. I haven't tried this before.. but it should be possible
