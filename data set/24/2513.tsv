2009-01-21T05:06:00.000Z	TheComrade		I'm going to bitch for a moment about my fresh amd64 Ubuntu install.
2009-01-21T05:07:00.000Z	TheComrade		I can to people who say that it's awesome.
2009-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	TheComrade		Ahem.
2009-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	TheComrade		Why not?  They are problems.  :)
2009-01-21T05:09:00.000Z	TheComrade		1) Randomly focus changes do not work, necessitating a ctrl-alt-backspace.  Apps still run and accept input.
2009-01-21T05:09:00.000Z	TheComrade		2) The shitty old version of Skype available does not function with Pulseaudio.
2009-01-21T05:10:00.000Z	TheComrade		It's not an app that is frozen; the whole desktop gets frozen.
2009-01-21T05:10:00.000Z	TheComrade		3) I have to constantly 'metacity --replace' and 'compiz --replace' to get video to be watchable without retarded amounts of shearing.
2009-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	TheComrade		4) At every login, a notification that I need to restart firefox appears so that updates can be applied.
2009-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	TheComrade		It's lame OS limitations caused by nerds who have no appreciation of aestethics.
2009-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	ff 3, there is a known bug for that issue, I have a workaround
2009-01-21T05:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	for ff restart issue try this    sudo killall -9 -r firefox
2009-01-21T05:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	sudo apt-get purge firefox firefox-3.0 ubufox
2009-01-21T05:13:00.000Z	TheComrade	exodus_ms	the notification appears every time, after reboots and all.
2009-01-21T05:13:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	sudo apt-get install --reinstall firefox firefox-3.0 firefox-3.0-gnome-support

2009-01-21T05:17:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	dude, whats up with the attitude, no one forced you to install Ubuntu
2009-01-21T05:18:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	btw, did you get the 'restart required' notification fixed?
2009-01-21T05:32:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	dude, just leave man,

2009-01-21T05:34:00.000Z	TheComrade	exodus_ms	I actually have attempted to run Civ 4 under Linux.  And it's not worth the effort.
2009-01-21T05:35:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	again 'ot' there arre plenty of other channels to discuss these issues
2009-01-21T05:35:00.000Z	TheComrade	exodus_ms	it's not OT, it's 'support'.  Blow me.
2009-01-21T05:36:00.000Z	exodus_ms	TheComrade	take a break man, come back when you have cooled off abit
