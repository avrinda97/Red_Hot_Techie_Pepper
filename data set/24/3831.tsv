2007-12-26T20:55:00.000Z	lukasz		Hey i'm back
2007-12-26T20:55:00.000Z	lukasz		Ubuntu starts fast now :)
2007-12-26T20:56:00.000Z	lukasz		I have a problem with Amarok and cannot play acc+ files :(
2007-12-26T20:57:00.000Z	lukasz		I can't play acc+ pls in amarok?
2007-12-26T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	aac?
2007-12-26T20:59:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	rip them to mp3 (convert) then no problems
2007-12-26T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	in amarok?
2007-12-26T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	shoutcast? or other
2008-02-04T22:08:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	you mean compiz?
2008-02-04T22:08:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	what card and what driver
2008-02-04T22:09:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	then install ccsm; compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-02-04T22:10:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	if you have the correct 3d driver for your card then alt-f2 compiz --replace will start it up you can adjust the various plugins in ccsm
2008-02-08T21:53:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	I think I see the problem ;]
2008-02-08T21:58:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	how important is this webcam to you? would you be willing to pay actual money for one? or is the MS one the one you really like and enjoy? there are a number of webcams that work without drivers: here is the link http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/cameras
2008-12-29T22:22:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	well you can either upgrade to intrepid or see if someone has made a ppa for hardy (which I doubt)
2008-12-29T22:11:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	need a question
2008-12-29T22:15:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	paste.ubuntu.com with the error
2008-12-29T22:16:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	you are trying to install something from the ppa?
2008-12-29T22:17:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	and you have the repo listed and updated correctly?
2008-12-29T22:18:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	please paste.ubuntu.com with your sources.list
2008-12-29T22:21:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	you are on hardy, and amarok ppa is for intrepid; also what is that 3rd party repo for?
2008-12-29T22:26:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	if there is not a hardy ppa then changing the name wont do anything
2008-12-30T00:11:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	you need intrepid for that, or find a hardy ppa
2008-12-30T00:12:00.000Z	bazhang	lukasz	did not paddy suggest telepathy?
