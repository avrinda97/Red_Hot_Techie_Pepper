2011-06-28T04:47:00.000Z	Roasted		When trying to run gksu nautilus I get - Nautilus could not create the frequired folder /root/.config/nautilus. create the following folder or set permissions such that nautilus can create it. Problem is, I cant create it.
2011-06-28T04:47:00.000Z	Roasted		How can I fix?
2011-06-28T04:48:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Stop running as root.
2011-06-28T04:48:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Failing that, sudo mkdir -p /root/.config/nautilus
2011-06-28T04:49:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	I need to run nautilus as root though because I dont have permission to usr/share/themes
2011-06-28T06:18:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Does the MS Zune work at all?
2011-06-28T06:18:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	yeah. I'm just curious if it works so I know whether it's worth my time to troubleshoot why this zune I just got doesnt mount. I get errors.
2011-06-28T06:19:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	It does not.
2011-06-28T06:24:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	This is a support channel, not an advocacy channel.  Please take it elsewhere.
2011-06-28T06:24:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Zune isn't supported here at all.  Try another channel?
2011-06-28T06:24:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	no thanks.
2011-06-28T06:24:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	no thanks.
2011-06-28T06:25:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Again, it's unsupported here.
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	I got it. Thanks.
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	that didn't help, but thanks.
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	I was asking for something LIKE an ipod, not an ipod.
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	You just asked for something ipod like that works.  How is an ipod not useful? :-)
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	it's made by Apple. Self explanatory there.
2011-06-28T06:26:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	but thanks.
2011-06-28T06:27:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	Go check out Rockbox then?
2011-06-28T06:27:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	I have RockBox on my Sansa. I wasn't too sure how much I liked it.
2011-06-28T06:27:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	in fact, once I put RockBox on my Sansa, it screwed up my default user interface that came with it. I actually prefer it to RockBox, and now I'm stuck with it. :(
2011-06-28T06:27:00.000Z	Roasted	Corey	I just want a half decent feature packed device that can sync music without a hassle.
2011-06-28T06:28:00.000Z	Corey	Roasted	You're going to have some kind of hassle no matter what you pick, unfortunately.
