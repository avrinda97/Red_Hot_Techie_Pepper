2007-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	B-777		Just installed pidgin 2.0.2 debian package, but need to know how to add it to the menu
2007-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	B-777		Snow, what do I do in that menu...don't see anything to add programs to the menu
2007-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	 system -> prefs -> main menu, sorry
2007-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	then on the left, click where you which mean you want to put it in, probably internet, then click new item
2007-07-07T08:02:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	your using the latest gnome tho right?
2007-07-07T08:03:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	haha its ok, do this, run "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2007-07-07T08:03:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	the upgrade will take a little longer, but will upgrade you to the latest of everything you have
2007-07-07T08:06:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	that probably didnt really help the problem at hand, but whatever, still a good thing to do, one sec
2007-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	do you have a .config folder in your homedir
2007-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	open term, type "cd ~/.config/menus/"
2007-07-07T08:11:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	does that work?
2007-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	iv never used anything but 7.04 so im not sure, im basically guessing here
2007-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	ok
2007-07-07T08:20:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	im so confused here, i dont see how your system menu can be different than mine
2007-07-07T08:21:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	yea but still, iv been looking at dapper guides
2007-07-07T08:22:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	i cannot find one specifically for dapper and changing menu items, other than the ~/.config/menus/ thing
2007-07-07T08:22:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	maybe go back in there, look at the one you did have
2007-07-07T08:22:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	maybe create an applications.menu file and add just pidgin into it
2007-07-07T08:23:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	most likely /usr/bin/
2007-07-07T08:25:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	you find the path?
2007-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	odd, give it another try, let me know how it goes
2007-07-07T08:32:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	it looks like those files are just xml files that the menu uses
2007-07-07T08:32:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	haha nice
2007-07-07T08:33:00.000Z	sn0w	B-777	np
