2009-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	Guest		I have a question regarding the Logon settings
2009-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	Guest		Does anyone know how to alter the Logon settings?
2009-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	emma	Guest	What is the question?
2009-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	emma	Guest	what in particular do you want to change?
2009-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	Guest	emma	The logon sound
2009-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	emma	Guest	how about try preferences-->sound-->sounds
2009-11-18T09:09:00.000Z	Guest	emma	do you mean "sound effects"
2009-11-18T09:09:00.000Z	Guest	emma	Because the only tab that relates to the given criteria is that one
2009-11-18T09:09:00.000Z	emma	Guest	no hold on i think things might have changed in the newer ubuntus, just a second.
2009-11-18T09:13:00.000Z	emma	Guest	surprisingly there does not seem to be an easy way to do this in Karmic, according to this Ubuntu BrainStorm, the moderator suggests filing a bug over the inability to easily change login sound --- http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/22136/
2009-11-18T09:15:00.000Z	emma	Guest	here's how i suggest you try doing it. Open a terminal and: cd /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo
2009-11-18T09:16:00.000Z	emma	Guest	in that directory you will find all the .ogg files that do the login and logout sounds. You should MAKE A BACK UP of what you replace, and then rename whatever .ogg sound file you WANT with the name of what is currently there.
2009-11-18T09:16:00.000Z	emma	Guest	if you are not comfortable with the command line you can probably get there and do that in nautilus (places).
2009-11-18T09:17:00.000Z	emma	Guest	But I'm suggesting make a backup of what is there, say rename desktop-login.ogg  to desktop-loggin-old.ogg
2009-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	Guest	emma	alright
2009-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	emma	Guest	then rename the-sound-you-want.ogg to be desktop-login.ogg
2009-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	Guest	emma	must the sound be in .ogg format?
2009-11-18T09:18:00.000Z	emma	Guest	and make sure it is in that directory /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo
2009-11-18T09:19:00.000Z	emma	Guest	that I don't know. I doubt it. But I do think it needs to be short.
2009-11-18T09:20:00.000Z	Guest	emma	on second thought, why does the sounds sometimes NOT play when I log in?
2009-11-18T09:20:00.000Z	emma	Guest	it might need to be in .ogg so that you can give it that name, it's possible that something is looking for the file with that exact name to run it at startup
2009-11-18T09:20:00.000Z	emma	Guest	no idea sorry :)
2009-11-18T09:20:00.000Z	Guest	emma	oh
2009-11-18T09:23:00.000Z	emma	Guest	that's why I suggest (if you want to use the command line) mv /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/desktop-login.ogg /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/desktop-login-original.ogg   and then, mv /path/to/your-sound.ogg /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/desktop-login.ogg
