2010-01-15T19:18:00.000Z	Dravekx		how do I symlink a directory to a user's home dir?
2010-01-15T19:19:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	youll need permission if your not the owner of the target.... right click on whatever and select make link or in terminal type man ln
2010-01-15T19:25:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	ls -l in the directory and thell showup like this        music -> /mnt/media/music
2010-01-15T19:25:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	kk.. its not working.
2010-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	I have a user in home/user  ... and I want to link him to /var/www/user
2010-01-15T19:27:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	the ln command is the one
2010-01-15T19:27:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	its not working via ssh. :(
2010-01-15T19:28:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	i always get ln -s backwards... dont listern/read (to) me
2010-01-15T19:36:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	symbolic links...... just a little
2010-01-15T19:37:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	isnt that correct? if I have a user locked his home/user directory, and I want him to see /var/www/user << then I symlink?
2010-01-15T19:37:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	yes... you need permissions/superuser privileges
2010-01-15T19:37:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	I have that. :)
2010-01-15T19:39:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	well its a permissions thing... i mean whoever owns this home directory that need a link has to be allowed to access /var/www/users... im not sure
2010-01-15T19:45:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	I created the link but the user cant see it via FTP.
2010-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	System / Administration / Users and Groups.... just untick the check boxes to remove from group
2010-01-20T16:06:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	maybe also try #apache
2010-01-20T16:06:00.000Z	Dravekx	iflema	they sent me here
2010-01-20T16:06:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	really

2010-01-20T16:12:00.000Z	iflema	Dravekx	just use/create a group and allow access that way... just for purposes of www
