2009-06-23T19:45:00.000Z	maveas	usr13	no
2009-06-23T19:38:00.000Z	usr13	maveas	If the drive is broken, you will need to get another working drive of the same type and take it appart (in a clean room) and switch platters.
2009-06-23T19:38:00.000Z	maveas	usr13	lol, not.
2009-06-23T19:39:00.000Z	usr13	maveas	sudo fdisk -l

2009-06-23T19:42:00.000Z	usr13	maveas	Is it mounted?
2009-06-23T19:46:00.000Z	usr13	maveas	If the drive is truly broken, you will need to get another working drive of the same type and take it appart (in a clean room) and switch platters.
2009-06-23T19:46:00.000Z	usr13	maveas	Or pay someone else to do it for you.
