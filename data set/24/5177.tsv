2006-10-03T06:10:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	thank you for doing that
2007-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	sure ther is :)
2007-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	apt-get install gparted
2007-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	i'm in the live session of dapper
2007-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	grab something newer than dapper :)
2007-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	i can't update gparted in this live session?
2007-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	grab a gutsy live cd instead of dapper if you want a newer gparted
2007-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	well i'm not so worried about gparted but the ntfsresize had to be updated.
2007-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	i can't burn a cd right now so i am not able to do that. Can i put it on a 1gb flash drive?
2007-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	the cd is about 700 mb, so if you can boot from usb flashdrive, that would work
2007-12-07T04:00:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	why can't i just update the gparted on this dapper cd live session?
2007-12-07T04:00:00.000Z	Seveas	mikeymike	because you'll run into dependency problems
2007-12-07T04:00:00.000Z	mikeymike	Seveas	:(
