2010-07-14T23:58:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	your webserver is asking for the *libraries* not the executable
2010-07-15T00:00:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- ok so how do we show apache that I have the libs?
2010-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	first try the OpenSSL version with sudo aptitude install libcurl4-openssl
2010-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- just tried that.. doesnt work
2010-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- I mean, it installed fine but after apache re-start it still doesnt see it
2010-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	which webapp are you running, btw?
2010-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- magento
2010-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	magento fine, it requires curl 3 or curl 4 or doesn't say
2010-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- doesnt specify
2010-07-15T00:04:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- by try you mean apt-get them?
2010-07-15T00:04:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	yes
2010-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- sorry about that my router crashed.. just installing now
2010-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	-  then I will restart apache and let you know if it worked
2010-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	ok
2010-07-15T00:09:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	-  it still doesnt work i am afriad
2010-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	wait a second
2010-07-15T00:10:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	-  np
2010-07-15T00:11:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	dude i didn't followed from the beggining and i though it was curl libraries what you need, the homepage says the php extension so go ahead on php5-curl and blame if that doesn't solves it
2010-07-15T00:12:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	-  ahh ok 1 sec
2010-07-15T00:13:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	-  ahh that worked.. thanks sir.. I should have been more specific..
2010-07-15T00:13:00.000Z	blackxored	Kingsy	no problem at all, and sir? and probably one of the youngest here ;)
2010-07-15T00:13:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- thanks.. it looks like it was pretty easy in the end and it seems to do alot of it for you :)
2010-07-15T00:14:00.000Z	Kingsy	blackxored	- lol .. well cheers
