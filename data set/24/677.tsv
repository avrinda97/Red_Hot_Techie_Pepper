2011-06-01T20:15:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	give more details please.  what kind of hardware are you using?  you probably can't install Ubuntu on your microwave oven.
2011-06-01T20:17:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	which version of ubuntu are you trying to install?
2011-06-01T20:20:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	big name factory built PC's from that era have been known to odd hardware.  Has it been able to boot any OS recently?
2011-06-01T20:21:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	no, you will spend all night compiling
2011-06-01T20:21:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	if you get that far.
2011-06-01T20:22:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	make sure you download the ubuntu 10.04 i386 version of ubuntu,  then check the disc for defects and do a memtest on your machine.
2011-06-01T20:23:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	if it installs, you will be a happy person.  if not, you will come back here and get more help.

2011-06-01T20:32:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	have you set your computer to boot from CD?
2011-06-01T20:33:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	right, so it's not reading the cd?
2011-06-01T20:33:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	how did you acquire the cd?

2011-06-01T20:38:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	let us know how you go
2011-06-01T20:57:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	yes, bad disc.  burn it to a *cd* using ubuntu.  check the disc afterwards using the instructions on the ubuntu website

2011-06-01T21:09:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	look for boot device priority or something like that
2011-06-01T21:10:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	joshuau	set DVD to 1, CD to 2, just to be sure.
