2009-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	dejavou42		I'm having a problem with my sudoers file. I have added a line that says "USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/scripts/script" However, when I try to run that script with sudo, it still asks for a password.
2009-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	.. and commas (if there was anyting els ein that line
2009-04-12T05:57:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	this is a no brained but... you did replace USER with your real username didn't oyu?
2009-04-12T05:58:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	yeah, it's my real user name... also, the file is owned by that user and is in a group that the user is in
2009-04-12T05:58:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	I also tried replacing USER with %GROUP in the sudoers file
2009-04-12T05:59:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	side issue.. but if you already own the file why the heck do you need sudo to open it?
2009-04-12T06:00:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	because the file is a bash file that uses gksu to run a command
2009-04-12T06:00:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	gksu shoudl replce sudo in this case... you din't need both
2009-04-12T06:01:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	??? I am not running sudo /myscript, I am just running /myscript
2009-04-12T06:03:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	nevermind.. i'm trying to open pastebin to show you something but my internet connectin is REALLY slow....
2009-04-12T06:03:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	do you wan't me to pastebin the script and the sudoers file?
2009-04-12T06:04:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	sure... but just the line from sudoers and the path to the script
2009-04-12T06:04:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	ok will do
2009-04-12T06:13:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	your sudoers is just fine
2009-04-12T06:13:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	maybe gksu is the culprit?
2009-04-12T06:14:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	possibly, but if I change gk to sudo, nothing happens
2009-04-12T06:14:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	whe you launch this form the terminal is the passowrd prompt immediate?
2009-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	to use sudo, I have to add xterm -e "sudo command --options"
2009-04-12T06:15:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	let me check
2009-04-12T06:16:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	it is immediate with gksu, I'm going to change it to sudo to see what happens
2009-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	bluejeans	dejavou42	sorry but have to get offline now... :( the real world is calling
2009-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	yes, with sudo too.
2009-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	understand, thanks for the help though
2009-04-12T06:18:00.000Z	dejavou42	bluejeans	thanks
