2008-01-26T16:40:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	what card do you have
2008-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	that should do--I had a compaq presario 1000 series that could dot it with an ancient ati card--bit laggy though
2008-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	well the real test is to try the livecd and see if any of it will work--even the basic stuff
2008-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	oh i can try off the live cd?
2008-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	very basic stuff yes
2008-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	the one's that come with the default installation right? like wobbly windows?
2008-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	correct! :}
2008-01-26T16:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	i see... thanks... i'll try that... :)
2009-08-09T08:23:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	ff plugin and dansguardian
2009-08-09T08:24:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	i have the foxfilter on ff already... does dansguardian have a gui?
2009-08-09T08:25:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	and is it necessary to have dansguardian as well? how different are they?
2009-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	if dansguardian is an internet content filtering system, how different would it be from foxfilter? does it add some other level of security?
2009-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	not sure as haven't tried them; perhaps you could experiment around and see
2009-08-09T08:31:00.000Z	gvsa123	bazhang	i see... thanks though... i also read about before asking here... it seems there something on the road for a better parental control... GChildCare

2009-08-09T08:36:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	it should be on the ppa page

2009-08-09T08:43:00.000Z	bazhang	gvsa123	those are the sources to add to your sources.list; I was referring to the homepage where you found them
