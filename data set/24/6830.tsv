2005-07-04T06:36:00.000Z	Technostalgia		hmm ok - someone said it was in Synaptic, and I think I need it to fix a KVM problem
2005-07-04T06:37:00.000Z	Technostalgia		yikes ;)
2005-07-04T06:37:00.000Z	Technostalgia		what does linux-image-2.6.11-1-686 do?
2005-07-04T06:38:00.000Z	Technostalgia		heh I'll try it, I'm a n00b and i'll only learn by trying :)
2005-07-04T06:39:00.000Z	Technostalgia		ok thanks - I'm just playing at the moment and have nothing to lose, I can always just reinstall
2005-07-04T06:40:00.000Z	Technostalgia		hi sly
2005-07-04T06:41:00.000Z	Technostalgia		hehe... well I am when it comes to the guts of Linux ;)
2005-07-04T06:42:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	if you feel like you wanna do more hard-core "adventuring" to the unstable world, get breezy ;)
2005-07-04T06:51:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	was that difficult to do?
2005-07-04T06:52:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	noopes
2005-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	if you want to use breezy repos for something... just "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and then comment out your installation CD and backports if you have those.. and for all the other rep-links put "breezy" instead of "hoary", save it, do "sudo apt-get update" and then run synaptic , browse for the "Base System", check the kernel version you want to install and install it.
2005-07-04T06:59:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	but dont do apt-get upgrade with breezy repos or you will end up with complete (and propably partly broken) breezy system
2005-07-04T07:01:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	I'll try that - cheers
2005-07-04T07:08:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	if it worked with a previous kernel, then just press esc while in grub at reboot and select the previous kernel you used
2005-07-04T07:13:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	thanks, the previous kernel works
2005-07-04T07:17:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	I think I've done the sources.list thing, which package do I need from "Base System"? linux-image-686?
2005-07-04T07:18:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	wait a bit
2005-07-04T07:20:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	yea linux-image<version you want>.i686 is right for the newest kernel on the i686 system
2005-07-04T07:23:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	are you surfing the breezy repos?
2005-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	sorry, I forgot to do apt-get update!
2005-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	do it but dont, DONT! do upgrade :D
2005-07-04T07:30:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	seems to be working, just got to wait for it to download (only on 512K broadband) - brb
2005-07-04T07:39:00.000Z	Technostalgia	Poromies	thanks, the kernel upgrade worked :)
2005-07-04T07:43:00.000Z	Poromies	Technostalgia	remember to edit back to hoary repos
