2006-11-11T17:51:00.000Z	rogue78		has anyone had problems with flash being out of sync with audio? the video is behind the audio for me
2006-11-11T17:51:00.000Z	rogue78		I just installed edgy
2006-11-11T17:51:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	remove flashplugin-nonfree and use the flash 9 beta
2006-11-11T17:57:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	put the lib in ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2006-11-11T17:57:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	make sure you remove the flashplugin-nonfree package, then restart ff
2006-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	when I try to play flash in mozilla, it's saying flash ain't installed.
2006-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	well, did you move the plugin to the correct location?
2006-11-11T06:00:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	sudo cp flash-player-plugin-9.0.21.55/libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins
2006-11-11T06:00:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	don't use sudo
2006-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	cp: accessing `/home/shawn/.mozilla/plugins/': Not a directory
2006-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	so create it.
2006-11-11T06:04:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	mkdir: cannot create directory `/home/shawn/.mozilla/plugins/': File exists
2006-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	and when I browse there with gnome, there is a plugins file with a padlock icon on it
2006-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	sudo chown -R $USER ~/.mozilla
2006-11-11T06:06:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	what does chown do?
2006-11-11T06:07:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	should I just try to delete that file?
2006-11-11T06:08:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	no
2006-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	I still can't copy to it, or make the directory
2006-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	sorry if I'm being annoying, but I'm a total noob for linux
2006-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	did you chown ~/.mozilla/plugins/ ?
2006-11-11T06:10:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	yes and the padlock icon went away, but it is still a file, not a folder
2006-11-11T06:11:00.000Z	crimsun	rogue78	rm ~/.mozilla/plugins && mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
2006-11-11T06:13:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	thanks a lot man, it works great now!
2006-11-11T06:45:00.000Z	rogue78	crimsun	do you know of any speech recognition software for linux?
