2011-05-26T18:57:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	ok you have to reinstall 9.10 or turn to 10.04, you can keep your data with home unformated

2011-05-26T19:01:00.000Z	guglu	ouyes	do you agree with what hiexpo  said ?
2011-05-26T19:02:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	I have used 8.04, so 9.10 and 10.04, 11.04 gnome xfce , one thing I can tell you, you should go to 10.04 and use gnome
2011-05-26T19:02:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	not just agree but I have the experience
2011-05-26T19:03:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	and tell one more thing, 10.04.2 has some problem when try to install on some type of laptops
2011-05-26T19:03:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	e.g thinkpad x201
2011-05-26T19:04:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	so find 10.04.1 and download it and then  install, then upgrade to 10.04.2
2011-05-26T19:05:00.000Z	ouyes	guglu	10.04 is amazing though it still have a lot of bugs out there
