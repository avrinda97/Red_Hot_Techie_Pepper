2008-11-02T12:24:00.000Z	rdw200169		whoops, i meant friendlyghost
2008-11-02T12:24:00.000Z	rdw200169		not myself ..
2008-11-02T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	_2: tar isn't compressed, just concatenated.
2008-11-02T12:26:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	i've been slapped!
2009-01-14T08:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	gonewestcoast, yeah, i'm using 8.04 so i don't know about 8.10, shouldn't be much different though
2009-01-14T08:05:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	The initd stuff still exists, there's just another abstraction
2009-01-14T08:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	that's what i figured
2009-01-14T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	The attitude isn't really necessary.
2009-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	As is the alternate CD with a command line install.
2009-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	yes, but that's difficult...
2009-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	Er... no?
2009-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	well, i guess no harder than installing linux-generic post-install of ubuntu-serer
2009-01-23T11:21:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	Its easier.  Select "install a command line system" from the boot menu.
2009-01-23T11:21:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	No swapping of kernels or anything afterwards.
2009-01-25T09:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	I *HATE* that bug
2009-01-25T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	It's not really a bug, its a specification, and a relatively sane one at that.
2009-01-25T09:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	yes, but i've gotten burned by that, so I hate it ;)
2009-01-25T09:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	in the least, it should syslog "hey idiot, you forgot the newline"
2009-01-25T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	Only half of it.
2009-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	Only the desktop stuff.  Server stuff is supported until 2011
2009-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	ah, i thought you were talking about a different 1/2, it was vague
2009-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	i'm assuming he's using desktop ;)
2009-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	rdw200169	Flannel	i think i said that, hehe, but maybe we all missed it, i know i thought it ;)
2009-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Flannel	rdw200169	you said the contents, yeah, he read it as /var/www plus the contents
