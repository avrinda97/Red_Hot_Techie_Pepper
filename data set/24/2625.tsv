2008-10-19T15:27:00.000Z	Clockswork		Lol! I had a GPU temp of 65 and a CPU temp of 53 in Idle.. I turned my computer over tried to loosen the lid to clean it...didnt find a matching screwdriver so I flipped it over again and now my CPU idle is 36 and my GPU is 54
2008-10-19T15:27:00.000Z	Clockswork		Weird!
2008-10-19T15:29:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	not weired at all. you should open the case for sure!
2008-10-19T15:30:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	Yes I know but I didnt open it, couldnt find a matching screwdriver so I just turned it on again and just by doing that I lowered my idle temps by 10 degrees
2008-10-19T15:31:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	yes, i know but thats just a side-effect: 1) your box got hot during use. 2) you turned it off, hence it cooled down. 3) you turn it on, everything seems fine, but if you start over heavy using it again, it will get hot again
2008-10-19T15:34:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	because once there is a dust layer coating the cooler, new dust will easily append to that layer and cause your problem all-over again. wont take more than 1-2 weeks and it will stress your components way more than necessary over time. so clean your box up twice a year
2008-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	Allright, I'll go by a matching screwdriver today :)
2008-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	but 43 degrees CPU idle tempereature isnt bad right?
2008-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	a side-effect might be, that the cooler will sound louder, because all the dust did absorb some of its sound
2008-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	I dont have a problem with fan noise :)
2008-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	no, its perfectly ok, if it stays that way.
2008-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	I've only had this laptop for 5 months anyways
2008-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	So I guess its time for my first cleaning
2008-10-19T15:37:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	my old X850XT GPU is the loudest component of my entire box. i will soon replace it with the onboard graphics but until intrepid that one is not supported properly.
2008-10-19T15:37:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	why didnt you tell me it is a laptop. do not open the laptop, it is much easier
2008-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	do you have a vacuum cleaner, that is capable of reversing thrust?
2008-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	so it blows out?
2008-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	I dont think so...
2008-10-19T15:39:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	some vacuum cleaners can do that. read the manual.
2008-10-19T15:40:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	So instead of opening it I just take my vacuum cleaner and point it at the fan opening? Wont that just make the dust fly around inside the laptop?
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	because if it can, simply do that, go outside with your laptop and vcleaner and set it to full blow with the smallest nozzle you have. hold it about 30cm away from the openings of the laptop and blow in while moving the nozzle from left to right.
2008-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	icewaterman	Clockswork	it'll blow out the dust without opening it.
2008-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	Clockswork	icewaterman	Allright thanks but lets do what ikonia says then :) Thanks alot :)
