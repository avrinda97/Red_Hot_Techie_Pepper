2005-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : i think there's some multihead stuff on the wiki
2005-09-11T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : search through wiki.ubuntu.com/TitleIndex
2005-09-11T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool		!tell jonnywedge about repos
2005-09-11T13:42:00.000Z	HappyFool		yeah, that explains the original easy-to-hack passwd file ;)
2005-09-11T13:42:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : i would guess those are the 'non-accelerated' drivers
2005-09-11T13:43:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	hmm....any guess where i'd find the accelerated drivers?
2005-09-11T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : i'm don't know much about amd64 -- i.e., if drivers even exist
2005-09-11T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : let me look on packages.ubuntu.com ...
2005-09-11T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : i would guess it's xorg-driver-fglrx
2005-09-11T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : have you read the ati page on the wiki?
2005-09-11T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool		!tell [t0rc]  about ati
2005-09-11T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	fizzle	still no luck?
2005-09-11T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	fizzle	ah. you need to set xmms to use the 'esound' output plugin
2005-09-11T13:45:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	well, the issue is I cannot find that one on the repos, is it on packages.ubuntu.com ?
2005-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : then you likely have an error in your repos setup
2005-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : look here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=fglrx&searchon=names&subword=1&version=hoary&release=all
2005-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : there is an amd64 version for hoary
2005-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	sweet thnx a billion.
2005-09-11T13:47:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	should I download all of those and install them? or just a few..?
2005-09-11T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : no, not all of them ;)
2005-09-11T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : if your repos are setup right, you shouldn't need to; anyway, the ony you want is *probably* xorg-driver-fglrx (second from bottom)
2005-09-11T13:47:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	k thnx. =D
2005-09-11T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool		[t0rc] : i recommend you try to fix your apt setup
2005-09-11T13:48:00.000Z	[t0rc] 	HappyFool	heh, no worries. im on a windows right now, linux pc isn't online. ;)
