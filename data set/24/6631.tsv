2006-03-20T11:44:00.000Z	michael		ty
2006-03-20T11:45:00.000Z	frank23	michael	there is a HOWTO in the forums I think
2006-03-20T11:46:00.000Z	frank23	michael	no for cvs. I mean for the regular version of cedega, you have to buy it
2006-03-21T10:22:00.000Z	frank23	michael	well make is definitely necessary. that's the one that compiles the program
2006-03-21T10:23:00.000Z	frank23	michael	compiling takes time. just let it finish
2006-03-21T10:24:00.000Z	frank23	michael	I'm not sure what make check does but it's a good idea to substitute the make install step with checkinstall
2006-03-21T10:25:00.000Z	frank23	michael	yes. use synaptic to install checkinstall. then you can use sudo checkinstall to install the program. checkinstall will make a .deb and install it for you
2006-03-21T10:25:00.000Z	frank23	michael	what program are you compiling anyways?
2006-03-21T10:26:00.000Z	frank23	michael	you have to install checkinstall with synaptic before it will work
2006-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	frank23	michael	actually it would be better if you just install maxima with synaptic.
2006-03-21T10:27:00.000Z	frank23	michael	using synaptic to install stuff is much easier
2006-03-21T10:29:00.000Z	frank23	michael	you only have to compile programs which are not available thru the repositories. and there is like 15000 packages available there
2006-03-21T10:30:00.000Z	frank23	michael	 when you have to compile? yeah, checkinstall installs the program with a .deb so it fits in with the rest of the system
2006-03-22T12:54:00.000Z	frank23	michael	 I just use the mediaplayerconnectivity extension instead of dealing with those media plugins
2006-03-22T12:56:00.000Z	frank23	michael	its a firefox extension. search for it in the extensions site
2006-03-22T13:00:00.000Z	frank23	michael	did you install that extension?
2006-03-22T13:00:00.000Z	frank23	michael	you have to uninstall/delete the media player plugin to stop the freezing maybe
2006-03-22T13:01:00.000Z	frank23	michael	mplayer
2006-03-22T13:02:00.000Z	frank23	michael	mediaplayerconnectivity is an extension, not the same thing as a plugin
2006-03-22T13:04:00.000Z	frank23	michael	what the extension will do is let you open videos in an external media player
2006-03-22T13:05:00.000Z	frank23	michael	yeah click that icon. you may need to configure the extension
2006-03-22T13:06:00.000Z	frank23	michael	what do you normaly use for wmv?
2006-03-22T13:07:00.000Z	frank23	michael	oh. you will have to get a normal player playing wmv. totem-xine + w32codecs should work I think
