2008-03-07T09:25:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	it cannot access the configuration file. Check if your partition is o.k. If it is, use the same procedure as to recover mbr after windows installation.
2008-03-07T09:26:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	and check if the config file contains proper writeups.
2008-03-07T09:26:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	cabrioleur	how can i check the parition is okay, i know how to do fixmbr to get back into windows but i wanna get this working
2008-03-07T09:27:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	the instruction as to when windows installation overwrites mbr. It will tell you how to reinstall grub. Using live cd you can check the partitions and files on them.
2008-03-07T09:28:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	cabrioleur	im using live cd now, sorry im a noob at this, how can i check the partitions and files are on them

2008-03-07T09:34:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	it's not hd0,0 in your case. http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/09/28/usb-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-install/
2008-03-07T09:39:00.000Z	eatatjoes2	cabrioleur	 it says to set USB as boot device in BIOS (my bios only has 3 options.... HD/network/cd
2008-03-07T09:40:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	invest in lilo then, and you will have to alter the hd a little bit.

2008-03-07T09:44:00.000Z	cabrioleur	eatatjoes2	not unmount, but umount
