2009-07-03T11:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Hi guys I was just wondering if there is an app in the repos that can remove all packages that are left behind after removing an installed app on my system? I have tried deborphan and its gtk counterpart gtkorphan and they both list packages that I need and not just ones left behind. I have Ubuntu Tweak installed and it has a remover that works really well but I would rather have a tool meant just for doing this.Anyone know of one that 
2009-07-03T11:17:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	try apt-get autoremove
2009-07-07T08:54:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Open terminal, edit menu, profile preferences.
2009-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	You can make it transparent , background image, whatever.
2009-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	no, i need to customize it from the launcher and ONLY for that terminal, not for all my terminals in my system
2009-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	sorry no idea
2009-07-07T08:56:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Unless there is a way in teh terminal to do it, there probably wont be a way for a launcher to.
2009-07-07T08:57:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	that's what i thought
2009-07-07T08:57:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Why would you need such a thing anyways?
2009-07-07T08:58:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	i keep getting confused between my terminals, i have one for each host and sometimes i think i'm working on one when it's the other
2009-07-07T08:59:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Might want to check out terminal profile names. Might be your answer.
2009-07-07T08:59:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	where's that??
2009-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Listed in the terminal, edit menu, profile preferences.
2009-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	mmm interesting. thanks
2009-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	i think i found it
2009-07-07T09:03:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	If you have, please share.
2009-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	manually??
2009-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	Yep
2009-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	naaah
2009-07-07T09:05:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	God forbid you have to actually think while using your PC.hehe jk'
2009-07-07T09:06:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	i'm thinking like crazy, administering a pvr, apache, samba, media center, backup server is not easy. this is just to let me focus on what matters
2009-07-07T09:06:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	You want to do this from a launcher?
2009-07-07T09:07:00.000Z	Hilikus	linuxguy2009	yes, like i said, it is possible and i gfound the answer already
2009-07-07T09:08:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Hilikus	gnome-terminal --help-window-options you can set the title from a launcher.
