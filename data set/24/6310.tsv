2006-01-18T16:00:00.000Z	Seveas	bobslaede	how far does it get?
2006-01-18T16:00:00.000Z	bobslaede	Seveas	well, depends, i cant boot X, well i can, but it freezes
2006-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	bobslaede	Seveas	i can run a terminal while booting, but it freezes
2006-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	bobslaede	Seveas	during install, the hdd is a scsi, but in macosx its a sataq
2006-01-18T16:01:00.000Z	Seveas	bobslaede	boot into recovery mode and check the logs
2006-01-18T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	bobslaede	sata and scsi discs both get /dev/sd* names
