2008-01-30T16:39:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	a good core os would be one that first and foremost supports the virtual machines and has a good support for a graphical interface for you to play with your virtual machines. you got a good dozen of them: debian, centos, fedora, ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu... whatever suits your stylish needs
2008-01-30T16:41:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	well i'm on OpenSuSe now (which i was using as my main system) but virtualization on it is crap. I've had Ubuntu being unstable issues. I always used Gutsy. Is Feisty better?
2008-01-30T16:41:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	feisty (7.04) is even more unstable compared to gutsy (7.10)
2008-01-30T16:42:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	And Dapper?
2008-01-30T16:43:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	well they say it's the long term support, it has to be stable. I can't remember though, after 2 years of upgrades :) gutsy seems to like me. btw, are you using virtualbox or vmware? http://www.virtualbox.org
2008-01-30T16:44:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	Which is better?
2008-01-30T16:44:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	definitely gutsy
2008-01-30T16:44:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	no i mean virtualbox or vmware?
2008-01-30T16:45:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	ah, vbox is a lot quicker when it comes to running applications, and I'm afraid that the binary package is the way to go (not the opensource) since they have some goodies installed along with the binary version, like the virtualbox addons
2008-01-30T16:46:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	Alright. I have a Gutsy CD in front of me. Think the unstableness has been me screwing the system up all the time?
2008-01-30T16:47:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	what are your system specifications? processor, ram memory, graphics card to begin with
2008-01-30T16:47:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	CPU: AMD Athlon 2800+, Videocard:ATI Radeon 9600, RAM: 768MB
2008-01-30T16:47:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	the ati card might be a problem
2008-01-30T16:48:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	why?
2008-01-30T16:48:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	well a lot of people complain about it, but give the livecd a go, if you have internet connection, I think the rest can be fixed :)
2008-01-30T16:49:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	alright. I've been using Ubuntu for about a year though. And Debian before that, and Gentoo before that. And i've not had many issues with my ATI card. But will virtual machines work? Oh, and one last question: Should i upgrade the core OS when the time comes?
2008-01-30T16:51:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	well my suggestion would be to install gutsy for now, use it for a year (until it is supported), then switch to hardy, which is a bug-fixing release, they say it's going to be even more stable
2008-01-30T16:52:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	use it for a year?
2008-01-30T16:52:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	Not directly switch to Hardy?
2008-01-30T16:53:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	yeah, but if you want something stable, give it some time, around june there will be another hardy release 8.04.1, I'd wait until june
2008-01-30T16:53:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	alright.
2008-01-30T16:53:00.000Z	savvas	Arelis	you yourself said you tend to break stuff, if you stick to one release for some time, you get stable :)
2008-01-30T16:54:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	alright :)
2008-01-30T16:54:00.000Z	Arelis	savvas	i didn't know there were 8.04.1 releases?
