2007-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	puli		i am new to ubuntu
2007-10-20T01:04:00.000Z	pike_	puli	hi welcome to ubuntu :)
2007-10-20T01:05:00.000Z	pike_	puli	whats the problem
2007-10-20T01:05:00.000Z	pike_	puli	youre indian?
2007-10-20T01:06:00.000Z	pike_	puli	ok so what problem do you have with installing the font? just dont know how to go about it?
2007-10-20T01:08:00.000Z	pike_	puli	open a terminal and type 'gksu nautlilus'  this will open your file manager as root rights.  then navigate to /usr/share/fonts/
2007-10-20T01:08:00.000Z	pike_	puli	what kind of fonts are these? the extension?
2007-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	pike_	puli	are these like ttf files?
2007-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	pike_	puli	look in truetype directory
2007-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	pike_	puli	sure
2007-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	pike_	puli	in the truetype dir you should have other dirs that have fonts in em just drag the font to one of those with the other ttf files
2007-10-20T01:14:00.000Z	pike_	puli	yes cool language :) you should just be able to drag and drop those files to same dir as the other ttf files
2007-10-20T01:18:00.000Z	pike_	puli	so i guess 'sudo fc-cache -f -v'
2007-10-20T01:18:00.000Z	pike_	puli	i wasnt sure how to recache or whatever
2007-10-20T01:19:00.000Z	pike_	puli	yeah you can close the other now
2007-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	pike_	puli	yes
2007-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	pike_	puli	that should be it. a reboot also would have worked but that is a little drastic :)
2007-10-20T01:29:00.000Z	pike_	puli	you should be all set
2007-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	pike_	puli	hope you stick with ubuntu :)  that command just rereads the fonts installed to build the cache  the cache is what ubuntu actually uses  windows is the same
2007-10-20T01:35:00.000Z	pike_	puli	im sorry i dont know the graphical environment that well
2007-10-20T01:36:00.000Z	pike_	puli	id thinkg you could just right click and change the properties of it but not sure
2007-10-30T00:46:00.000Z	pike_	puli	what error?
