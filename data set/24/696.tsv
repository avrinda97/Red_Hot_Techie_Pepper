2011-03-21T22:47:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	do you mean you have limited session activity?

2011-03-21T22:48:00.000Z	manous		95%
2011-03-21T22:51:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	are you running any jobs in the background that may be causing the resource levels to be so high?
2011-03-21T22:53:00.000Z	manous	LittleRed	no it' s fresh install
2011-03-21T22:53:00.000Z	LittleRed		I'm thinking there may be something on your site sucking up bandwidth...
2011-03-21T22:54:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	I'm thinking there may be something on your site sucking up bandwidth...
2011-03-21T22:54:00.000Z	manous	LittleRed	how can i check it to know
2011-03-21T22:55:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	I'm not sure of the linux command needed... I run into this at work (evil windows network)
2011-03-21T22:56:00.000Z	manous		ok
2011-03-21T22:56:00.000Z	LittleRed		Manous: did you build the site yourself?
2011-03-21T22:56:00.000Z	manous	LittleRed	yes
2011-03-21T22:57:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	I can guess you can check the code in your session protocol ... but like I said, I'm not 100% sure
2011-03-21T22:58:00.000Z	manous	LittleRed	ok i see
2011-03-21T22:59:00.000Z	LittleRed	manous	there are various things to check, but it probably lies in the code for the site..
