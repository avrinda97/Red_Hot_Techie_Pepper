2007-02-27T14:12:00.000Z	doseryder		 Does anyone know how to reconfigure GRUB so that BIOS will recognize it as the main bootup partition?  I have 3 partitions on the same drive (XP being the initial installation, ubuntu being the second, vista third and is the cause to this whole problem)
2007-02-27T14:12:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	i dunno if i understand your question. is grub on its own partition?
2007-02-27T14:13:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	is grub on its own partition or what? are you having problems booting?
2007-02-27T14:15:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	Prior to installation of vista (which is a cause to this problem) i had xp (first installation) and ubuntu (2nd install) working flawlessly
2007-02-27T14:15:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	did you say that you have Vista AND XP now or just Vista?
2007-02-27T14:16:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	i've got vista and ubuntu on my box at home - i just need to know if you have XP, and Vista, and Ubuntu or what
2007-02-27T14:18:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	Realistically, I have all 3.  After vista installation, GRUB is no longer the default boot loader.  I tried the usual: root (hd0, 4) and setup (hd0)
2007-02-27T14:18:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	you installed vista _after_ ubuntu?
2007-02-27T14:19:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	but that doesn't seem to bring my GRUB back.  yes i installed vista after ubuntu (XP (1)-> Ubuntu(2) -> Vista)
2007-02-27T14:19:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	vista prolly overwrote your mbr. you need to reinstall grub
2007-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	if i remember correctly, you can also boot with the live cd and install it from command line. really easy that way, too imho

2007-02-27T14:22:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	The weird thing is, If I boot up without pressing f12 key it will boot into XP but if i press f12 and choose to boot from primary sata drive it will recognize GRUB and boot using GRUB
2007-02-27T14:22:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	do you have a sata drive and a ide drive, by any chance?
2007-02-27T14:24:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	i do have ide drive but i need to mention that all 3 partitions XP, ubuntu and vista are on the sata drive (sda1)
2007-02-27T14:24:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	forget about sda1 part that doesn't have to do with it
2007-02-27T14:25:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	then i'm stumped right now =T i'm not exactly sure what to suggest
2007-02-27T14:25:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	it definitely has to do with the microsoft bootloaders, but i've never experienced this before
2007-02-27T14:30:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	at this link that you sent me https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows it saids that "Don't forget that this method, as described, puts GRUB back on the MBR (master boot record) of the hard drive instead of in the root parititon. This is fine for most people, but not if you already have an alternative boot manager."
2007-02-27T14:31:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	in my case, do i want it grub back on the mbr or the root partittion?
2007-02-27T15:49:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	at this link that you sent me earlier https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows it saids that "Don't forget that this method, as described, puts GRUB back on the MBR (master boot record) of the hard drive instead of in the root parititon. This is fine for most people, but not if you already have an alternative boot manager."
2007-02-27T15:51:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	i've always kept mine on the mbr and have had no trouble booting other os's. then again, if something goes wrong, are you going to be okay with possibly having to reinstall? :)
2007-02-27T15:53:00.000Z	doseryder	tm4-	Are you saying if something goes wrong in the event that I install GRUB on MBR or root partition that may put me in jeopardy?
2007-02-27T15:54:00.000Z	tm4-	doseryder	im just saying that if something goes wrong, worst case scenario is you'll have to reinstall your os'
