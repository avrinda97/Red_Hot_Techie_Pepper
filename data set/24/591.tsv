2011-08-22T01:45:00.000Z	JoeR1		Ok I have a Pentium D (dual core 64 @like 2.4 or so) with a Geforce 9400 and 1080 MKV files decode poorly with some choppyness on my system, The CPU should be more than enough to handle any 1080 recording and I have a wholly unnecessary 2 gig of ram, any suggestions for improving playback quality of MKV 1080 files?

2011-08-22T01:47:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	What player(s)? Are you using GPU acceleration (vdpau)? Do you have the latest drivers fro nVidi website?
2011-08-22T01:48:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	- Latest Nvidia driver are incompatible with my kernel, not that it matter since this problem existed before the kernel upgrade anyway

2011-08-22T01:49:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	What system and kernel?
2011-08-22T01:50:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	Xubuntu - kernel 3.0.1
2011-08-22T01:52:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	This is strange. I have Ubuntu 11.04 running on a custom kernel 3.0.0, Pentium IV 3,GHz (Northwood, 512KB L2, HT, FSB533) and 7300GT and I can easily run a 12Mbps 108-p AVI.
2011-08-22T01:53:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed?
2011-08-22T01:53:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	You understand my confusion then
2011-08-22T01:53:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	yes
2011-08-22T01:54:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	What version of nVidia driver do you have?
2011-08-22T01:55:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	I have notice that MKV's seem to be more demanding then AVI's or any other format - I do not have the Nvidia drivers because they are NOT compatible with my kernel . . . or perhaps my kernel configuration, wither way they crash my kernel
2011-08-22T01:57:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Then you have only the Nouveau open-source driver with a performance completely uncomparable to Forceware. I would still recommend trying 285.03 beta, and/or getting back to 11.04 if you run Oneiric.
2011-08-22T02:00:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	- I am on 11.04, and there is NO WAY i need GPU acceleration to run these file the CPU has way crazy more power then it should need for this task
2011-08-22T02:01:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Is it the same with generic kernel? Where do you have this 3.0.1 from anyways - kernel pPA or a hand-made compilation?
2011-08-22T02:04:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Again - is it the same with the generic kernel, and where have you taken this 3.0.1 from?
2011-08-22T02:08:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	- I am going to try to remain calm so please listen and perhaps you will understand - this issue existed BEFORE I upgraded kernels when I was using the most recent Nvidia drivers and GPU acceleration was enabled, I am not going to dicsuss my kernel because it is not the question I have. I want to know if you can direct me to a media player that perhaps has a very small resource footprint or perhaps some codec related opti
2011-08-22T02:15:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Sorry. Then I'm even more confused.
2011-08-22T02:16:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	thank you for your concise amswer, to be fair I think they are mpgs
2011-08-22T02:17:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	I'm out  of ideas and dead-tired
2011-08-22T02:18:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	It appears to me that the answer to my questions lies else where so i shall spend my time investigating
2011-08-22T02:18:00.000Z	Galvatron	JoeR1	Something might be bad with codecs. Try reinstalling the whole Gstreamer + plugins.
2011-08-22T02:19:00.000Z	JoeR1	Galvatron	 that seems like a worthy place to start
