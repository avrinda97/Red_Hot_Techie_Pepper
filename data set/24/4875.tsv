2007-09-24T14:56:00.000Z	umop-apisdn		anyone have any experience with fwbuilder? i'm trying to install it on a brand new 6.06 server install, and i'm not smarter than the package
2007-09-24T14:58:00.000Z	umop-apisdn		"libfwbuilder depends on libc6 (>= 2.5-0ubuntu1); however: Version of libc6 on system is 2.3.6-0ubuntu20.5" <-- how can i fix that?
2007-09-24T14:59:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	you are most likely installing an application from a higher Ubuntu version.
2007-09-24T14:59:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	you'd need to upgrade that libc package as well, though I strongly advice against that.
2007-09-24T14:59:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	so i can't get updated? do i have to go get the latest version, or is there a path without reinstalling this box?
2007-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	what's the package in question?
2007-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	the first thing you should do is look for a backport.
2007-09-24T15:01:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	the one i'm attempting to install? fwbuilder (available at http://www.fwbuilder.org )
2007-09-24T15:01:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	it's breaking when i try to install the required libfwbuilder package
2007-09-24T15:02:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	are you using Feisty?
2007-09-24T15:02:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	no, i'm using 6.06 server, figured the LTS would be a good option
2007-09-24T15:02:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	would you recommend i reload clean from the 7.04 server iso?
2007-09-24T15:03:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	there's fwbuilder 2.0.9 in dapper, you should perfectly be able to use that.
2007-09-24T15:03:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	With Feisty all you seem to get in terms of fwbuilder is a tiny upgrade.
2007-09-24T15:03:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=fwbuilder&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all
2007-09-24T15:04:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	omg... ok, how do i get it to find/install that?
2007-09-24T15:04:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	just enable the universe repository in your server and install fwbuilder
2007-09-24T15:04:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	you know how to enable repositories and install software in Ubuntu?
2007-09-24T15:04:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	please forgive my ignorance, but how do i enable the universe repository? i'm running without a GUI here, and i'm a bit lost
2007-09-24T15:05:00.000Z	cosmodad		!repository | umop-apisdn
2007-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	cosmodad	thanks, now i have a direction to flail in ;)
2007-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	you need to follow the command-line approach
2007-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	there you go
2007-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	cosmodad	umop-apisdn	if you follow Scunizi short-cut without reading the wiki entry, don't forget to "sudo apt-get update" as well.
