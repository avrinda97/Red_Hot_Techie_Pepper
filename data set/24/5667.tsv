2006-06-04T11:22:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	just getting xgl is not that fun after you check once or twice and it is a resource hog
2006-06-04T11:24:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	so stick with breezy for now then
2006-06-04T11:25:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	i learned the hard way to have a bin dir under my home dir. If you wana upgrade just for xgl sake do not do it. otherwise dapper is much better
2006-06-04T11:27:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	but you can wait till some howtos emerge and they stream all the remaning bugs
2006-06-04T11:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	yeah i guess ill do that wait, ill keep tryin dont think itll do harm
2006-06-12T16:21:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	better use gconf-editor and scroll down to totem
2006-06-12T16:21:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	 is that the same for xubuntu
2006-06-12T16:22:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	i would assume but am not sure
2006-06-12T16:22:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	it loads, yep
2006-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	hey is that package for Dapper?
2006-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	yap
2006-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	 you rock thanks man
2006-06-21T09:25:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	it is not perfect but better than nothing. linux-2.6.16.17 will have native support for broadcom so the next release of ubuntu i believe
2006-06-21T09:26:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx

2006-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	might have missed that package
2006-06-21T09:28:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	eFoX look at using the new broadcom driver
2006-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	you need the bcmwl.sys file though there is a link i think to where you can download one
2006-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	not the bcmwl5.sys from before
2006-06-21T09:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	ill give that a shot with my other laptop sometime, im gonna get it goin
2006-06-23T15:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	dapper?
2006-06-23T15:58:00.000Z	farous	SurfnKid	yap and was running in breezy too
2006-06-23T15:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	 did dapper detect it or did you install it
2006-08-10T12:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	farous	how do i set the permissions on apache to remove forbidden file access on the main root dir of apache?
