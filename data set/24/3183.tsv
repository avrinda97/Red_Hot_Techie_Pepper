2008-04-12T11:56:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	is your game not playable in wine?
2008-04-12T11:57:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 I never tried wine, they released it for linux 7.1
2008-04-12T11:58:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	which game are you talking about?
2008-04-12T11:58:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 Eve-Online.
2008-04-12T11:58:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 I meant Ubuntu 7.1 :P
2008-04-12T11:59:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=9971   eve should be perfectly functional under wine.  give it a try
2008-04-12T11:59:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 WIll do.
2008-04-12T12:00:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	  How do I go about uninstalling the version I have installed/
2008-04-12T12:00:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	howd you isntall it in the first place?
2008-04-12T12:00:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 with the file i downloaded from their site.. I'm pretty new to linux, it just kinda did it's thing.
2008-04-12T12:01:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	so you just double clicked the .exe file from their site and let it try to run?
2008-04-12T12:01:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 The RPM, or whatever Ubuntu uses, yes.
2008-04-12T12:04:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	sorry, i am quite confused then. what did you download? a .deb package?
2008-04-12T12:05:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 Yes.
2008-04-12T12:05:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 From Eve-Online.com
2008-04-12T12:06:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	ah, a .deb...hmm, well, i know for certain that under wine it works so try the windows install file exe and try that in wine, i dont know anything about the .deb part
2008-04-12T12:06:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 Ok, I'll do that, thanks
2008-04-12T12:06:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 How do i remove the install i have, though?
2008-04-12T12:07:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	i think you can either undo it from Synaptic or maybe if you open the .deb again it gives you that option (i think it may only give you reinstall tho).
2008-04-12T12:07:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	either way, if you cant uninstall you should be able to install to wine and it wont matter if the .deb version is installed.  entirely different beast, wine is.
2008-04-12T12:08:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 I don't like clutter.
2008-04-12T12:09:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 *
2008-04-12T12:10:00.000Z	CorbinFox	StPatrick	ok, then installing it in wine should be all you need.  http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=9971    that is the page for eve, so try that when you are ready
2008-04-12T12:11:00.000Z	StPatrick	CorbinFox	 Ok, thanks a ton. G night.
