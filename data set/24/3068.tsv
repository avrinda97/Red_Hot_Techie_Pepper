2008-07-09T21:24:00.000Z	djhash		*sigh*.. why can't we have autocomplete with apt-get?!! i mean the package list/db is downloaded at every update....
2008-07-09T21:24:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	I have autocomplete with apt-get
2008-07-09T21:24:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	really? how?
2008-07-09T21:25:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	I type sudo apt-get install openoff and press <tab>.. it just fills in the rest
2008-07-09T21:26:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	 it wont auto complete when you are in root...
2008-07-09T21:26:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	"in root" ?? you mean logged in as root?
2008-07-09T21:27:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	yes..
2008-07-09T21:27:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	one more reason not to log in as root...
2008-07-09T21:27:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	it's probably something that's just setup for the regular user
2008-07-09T21:28:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	probably...meh.. I get tired to typing sudo before every command..
2008-07-09T21:29:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	hehe.. well.. it's in a file somewhere.. I remember running into that file by mistake..
2008-07-09T21:30:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	might have been .bashrc or something like that
2008-07-09T21:31:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	AWN... needs to implement an Alert box.. so when people try to run it without turning on compiz.. they'll be told they need to have it running!!!!
2008-07-10T01:29:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	tsk..tsk..
2008-08-21T22:16:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	yes, it's normal.. you can set the number of processes in the apache config file
2008-08-21T22:17:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	ok... thanks
2009-01-06T20:35:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	can you do that? doesn't it have to be at some specific place?
2009-01-06T20:36:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	just asking out of curiosity
2009-01-06T20:37:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	ok.. so it was a little confusing.. i dont want to move where the table is stored.. but I want to change the table definition of a partition from xxxx start/end sectors to yyyyy start/end sectors
2009-01-06T20:39:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	i made a mistake when I was moving partitions.. using gparted.. and I ended up moving the table without moving the data.. now i want to move the table back to where the data actually is..
2009-01-06T20:39:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	hmm.. I would take a look at testdisk
2009-01-06T20:40:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	THANK YOU.. you just slapped my brain good.. i was thinking fdisk.. when i needed testdisk..
2009-01-06T20:41:00.000Z	Slart	djhash	oh.. what a nice image.. hannibal lecter would be proud =).. you're welcome
2009-01-06T20:42:00.000Z	djhash	Slart	haha.. thanks.. i'm fixed now.. i'll reboot and check
