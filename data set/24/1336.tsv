2011-12-26T01:58:00.000Z	dustin_		sorry msterbrewer
2011-12-26T01:58:00.000Z	dustin_		the side bar in unity can get anoying too
2011-12-26T01:58:00.000Z	dustin_		since your window close and back button are right there

2011-12-26T01:59:00.000Z	dustin_		and its not very new user friendly
2011-12-26T01:59:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	agreed
2011-12-26T02:04:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	what's your problem?
2011-12-26T02:06:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	sounds pretty cut and dry, ifconfig -a shows the interface available?
2011-12-26T02:07:00.000Z	dustin_	dork	for some reason the system wants to default everything to one card
2011-12-26T02:07:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	default what? the route?
2011-12-26T02:07:00.000Z	dustin_	dork	then is ignores the other
2011-12-26T02:08:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	can you do an ifconfig -a and a route -n and pastebin it?
2011-12-26T02:08:00.000Z	dustin_	dork	if I use ETH 0 for internet connection it tries to send everyting through it
2011-12-26T02:08:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	so you need to change your routes
2011-12-26T02:08:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	you need to add a route
2011-12-26T02:09:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	i need a comprehensive explaination of what you're trying to do as far as your ethernet interfaces and routes go
2011-12-26T02:15:00.000Z	dustin_	dork	I guess I am not fallowing, can I have ETH2 assign IP to the PS3? with dhcp
2011-12-26T02:59:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	nope
2011-12-26T02:59:00.000Z	dork	dustin_	no help allowed here apparently
