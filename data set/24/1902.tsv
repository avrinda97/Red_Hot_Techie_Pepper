2009-10-21T13:58:00.000Z	RhysM		I need all the obvious stuff open source but what about alternatives to citrix?
2009-10-21T13:59:00.000Z	RhysM		Action no i mean a server alternative open source? is there something like it?
2009-10-21T14:00:00.000Z	RhysM		I dont think you understand what i am saying.... I am looking for an open source remote working desktop solution with comparable features to citrix
2009-10-21T14:02:00.000Z	RhysM		isn;t the aim of linux to promote open source? well thats exactly what i am trying to do
2009-10-21T14:02:00.000Z	RhysM		And by finding the name of components/software to use i can then go away and read up and figure it out
2009-10-21T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	you can get the same under windows with putty and xming
2009-10-21T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	there is a citrix client for linux
2009-10-21T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	http://www.citrix.com/English/SS/downloads/details.asp?downloadID=3323&productID=-1
2009-10-21T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	linux makes a great thin client OS
2009-10-21T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	well citrix is a proprietary product, you may be able to buy the server software for linux
2009-10-21T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	you could run xen or x forwarding to achieve the same kind of thing
2009-10-21T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	unfortunately citrix as far as I can see is only offering presentation servers to windows platforms
2009-10-21T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	you can use X forwarding over ssh to run the app on the big central server but show the app on the client system (much like citrix)
2009-10-21T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	yeah simply have the xming running which will give you an x server, if the clients are linux then you already have this
2009-10-21T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	you can then run: putty -X user@server     or  ssh -X user@server    and log in, when you run gui apps (like gedit / oowriter etc) they will be executed on the server but the graphical bit will be on the client system
2009-10-21T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	sure putty is fine but you will need xming installed and running as windows does not have an x server to stick the apps on
2009-10-21T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	if you are planning many users make sure you use gigabit ethernet or it will crawl
2009-10-21T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	nice, that'll do it
2009-10-21T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	those 2950s are niiiice
2009-10-21T14:39:00.000Z	RhysM	ActionParsnip	are there any cost/legal implications of using open source software in a corporate environment?
2009-10-21T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	you cannot see the OS itself, thats all (as its not yours to sell) otherwise, go crazy
2009-10-21T14:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	dont use it, there are lots of search engines out there
2009-10-21T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	i hate how it adds a whole bunch of crap to copied urls when you copy them
2009-10-21T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RhysM	its so infuriating
