2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	karim		is there a way to adjust subtitles size in the DVD's ? I can't with gxine xine or mplayer.
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	no dvd subtitles are encoded are images, not as characters
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	karim		and totem
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	???
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	you sure about that ?
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	you can if your subtitles are located in a seprate subtitle file that you can download on the net
2006-05-27T14:26:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	100% sure
2006-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	when you rip a dvd, it has to do OCR to backup the subtitles
2006-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	really ? damnit what a bunch of morons
2006-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	find the subtitles
2006-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	Donvinzk		in a file
2006-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	Donvinzk		then name it exactly as your video file
2006-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	what are ou talking about, I am watching a DVD
2006-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	karim		not a divx
2006-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	Donvinzk		a.avi wil have its a.srt subtitle file in the same dir
2006-05-27T14:28:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	a DVD not a divx
2006-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	you can watch a dvd AND ask the player to load a subtitle file ...
2006-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	the reason I borrowed the dvd is to not be bothered by the subtitles
2006-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	Donvinzk	karim	then you haev to accept the fixed size issue ;-)
2006-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	I don't understand, we can't resize the size.
2006-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	my eyes are bleeding
2006-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	Donvinzk		enter the clown
2006-05-27T14:38:00.000Z	karim	Donvinzk	I have read a solution is to reduce the resolution. I had this idea but couldn't believe it was the only way, so I didn't tried
