2011-04-23T00:03:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	thats exactly the problem, i need the wifi card for internet
2011-04-23T00:04:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	Maybe you could ask here on how to make your wifi card work
2011-04-23T00:05:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	I have a guide i am trying to follow, but i need to install some packages, which i currently dont have
2011-04-23T00:07:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	you may post here the package and I'll try to give you the depends and the URL's here in mine
2011-04-23T00:10:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	yes, but I could only give you the URL's that you could download
2011-04-23T00:13:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	it's a shell script
2011-04-23T00:17:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	http://pastebin.com/tr9BYDGw I have dkms installed, not sure in the dependencies
2011-04-23T00:18:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	ok, ya i need like ALL the depends, so thats not going to work
2011-04-23T00:18:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	I used "generate download package script" in synaptic
2011-04-23T00:19:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	ya, but you probably have gcc and libc6 and stuff installed
2011-04-23T00:20:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	dkms have make, build-essential, dpkg-dev, gcc, and module-init-tools
2011-04-23T00:21:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	You may also ask someone here who don't have dkms installed, you might be able to get all dependencies
2011-04-23T00:22:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	To use Synaptic's Generate Package Download Script, you need internet for the Ubuntu machine to update the list of packages
2011-04-23T00:29:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	You need to update atleast once
2011-04-23T00:29:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	i shouldnt need net, just a current apt cache
2011-04-23T00:32:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	You may ask someone here that don't have dkms installed, especially those who have newly installed Ubuntu
2011-04-23T00:32:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	i have not tried that, but ill see whats up with it
2011-04-23T00:32:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	Or you can trace it yourself, that's quite hard
2011-04-23T00:36:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	Thanks so much man, this is EXACTLY what i need to do
2011-04-23T00:36:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	You're able to solve your problem?
2011-04-23T00:37:00.000Z	juv1228	Galeon	following the guide you linked this will solve it
2011-04-23T00:39:00.000Z	Galeon	juv1228	do you have these installed? module-init-tools, gcc, build-essential, dpkg-dev, patch? They are dkms's dependencies
