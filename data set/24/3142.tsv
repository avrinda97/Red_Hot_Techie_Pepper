2010-09-14T19:30:00.000Z	Emanon	undecim	keyfile or passphrase?
2010-09-14T19:30:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	Keyfile stored on USB drive
2010-09-14T19:31:00.000Z	Emanon		autodetect on insertion darn idk how to do that
2010-09-14T19:31:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	The USB drive will also hold /boot
2010-09-14T19:31:00.000Z	Emanon		right thats how i do it undecim
2010-09-14T19:31:00.000Z	Emanon		try the alternate install iso you might be able to define that in the crypto options
2010-09-14T19:32:00.000Z	Emanon		i think there is an option for keyfile instead of passphrase
2010-09-14T19:32:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	I tried the alternate install and it didn't give a keyfile option
2010-09-14T19:32:00.000Z	Emanon		oh ok darn sorry
2010-09-14T19:32:00.000Z	Emanon		larger than if you dont do it Katsumi32
2010-09-14T19:34:00.000Z	Emanon		ahh Katsumi32 good lick
2010-09-14T19:34:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	I've already determined that I will just have to configure it manually and I know what I'm doing, I'm just missing the one crucial part of putting my script (or a script that comes with cryptsetup) into the initrd every time it is created
2010-09-14T19:34:00.000Z	Emanon		good lick sorry
2010-09-14T19:35:00.000Z	Emanon		luck darnit
2010-09-14T19:35:00.000Z	Emanon		can't type today
2010-09-14T19:35:00.000Z	Emanon		hehe
2010-09-14T19:35:00.000Z	Emanon	undecim	sorry i cant help i use passphrase and dont know the manual args
2010-09-14T19:36:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	So you used the alternate install to setup encryption w/ passphrase?
2010-09-14T19:37:00.000Z	Emanon		yes i did undecim
2010-09-14T19:37:00.000Z	Emanon		and i used pwgen to make good passwords too
2010-09-14T19:38:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	Could you maybe see if there is something to do with cryptsetup in /etc/initramfs-tools?
2010-09-14T19:38:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	Or maybe just give me a copy of that entire directory and let me look at it myself?
2010-09-14T19:39:00.000Z	Emanon		actually im in a live disk right now i would if i could undecim
2010-09-14T19:39:00.000Z	undecim	Emanon	Alright, that's fine. I'll do some more googleing.
