2007-06-05T12:17:00.000Z	godzirra		It feels so wrong to have a 50 gig /home partition... It goes against everything my poor little sysadmin heart stands for.
2007-06-05T12:17:00.000Z	godzirra		;)
2007-06-05T12:17:00.000Z	bitmvnch	godzirra	what's wrong with a big /home? ;)
2007-06-05T12:17:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	I've never ran linux as a desktop.  Only as a server.
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch	godzirra	still, there are users in the loop, eh?
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	And any user that needs a 50 gig home directory on a server needs to be slapped. :)
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch		i suppose 50G needs context in size of overall storage(s).
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	not usually.  Its my own personal webserver.
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch	godzirra	sure but maybe 100 users, eh? ;)
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	This is for a laptop.  heh
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch	godzirra	oh yeah if it's just you, man, that's probably a lot ;d
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch		give that to /opt
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	bitmvnch		or /var
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	Thats what soundray suggested.
2007-06-05T12:18:00.000Z	godzirra		Hrm.  Maybe I should just make a 20 gig home partition and make the other 50 gigs /
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	bitmvnch		yeh if you want to just give a bunch of space to some big pile of stuff, /var or /opt, i vote for /opt unless your /var is over half of /
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	bitmvnch	godzirra	not a bad idea, never underestimate the value of personal, internet-located temp space.
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	godzirra		 bitmvnch I have no idea whats g oing to be on it so far.  I've never had a linux laptop :)
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	bitmvnch		oh, wait, you said this is for the laptop
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	bitmvnch		well, your /home is going to be full of porn, mp3s, and source code you don't understand
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	bitmvnch		:-P
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	godzirra		Yes
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	lmao
2007-06-05T12:19:00.000Z	godzirra	bitmvnch	I have a desktop for that.
