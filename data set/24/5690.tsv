2006-05-25T06:22:00.000Z	dli	saquib	what do you want to do?
2006-05-25T06:23:00.000Z	dli	saquib	" sudo update-grub "
2006-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	dli	saquib	read the output
2006-05-25T06:26:00.000Z	dli	saquib	don't flood here, learn about pastebin
2006-05-25T06:27:00.000Z	dli	saquib	interesting, you build those kernels?
2006-05-25T06:29:00.000Z	dli	saquib	better to keep default 0 , it might be confusing later, if you change it to default 2
2006-05-25T06:38:00.000Z	dli	saquib	you can not, but you can press "e" to edit (for this booting), or "c" to command line

2006-05-27T06:10:00.000Z	dli	saquib	I suppose so, you can write a script to do import, but that's nothing but stupid, there should be a way
