2010-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	suweid		Howdy, I was wondering if someone could maybe help me with a weirdo problem. My ISP uses some kind of custom settings... I don't know what it is exacly, but internet basically works after about 3 minutes of inactivity, when I plug it into my stationary computer. On my laptop however, it does not work. My best guess is that some DHCP setting needs longer timeout. Could someone all knowning point me to the right direction?
2010-10-13T04:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	is this dsl?
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	ehternet jack from the wall.
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	ok.. is this in your house or a business setting?
2010-10-13T04:30:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	house.
2010-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	other people in the house have the same problem. After connecting jack to computer it take a few minutes to connect. This time it doesn't work though. :/
2010-10-13T04:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	well.. that jack in the wall goes someplace else in the house which interfaces to the cable line or phone line for internet access.. and has an internet "modem" attached.
2010-10-13T04:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	that modem is for cable internet or DSL.. do you know which?
2010-10-13T04:32:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	I'm from sweden, we don't have DSL. Everyone has ethernet everywhere! No modems...
2010-10-13T04:33:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	the connection is basically silent for a while, and then it starts to talk back.
2010-10-13T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	wow.. so it must come in via fiber or something.. well. I really don't know I'm sorry to say.. you might ask your ISP about that .. if others are having the same problems then it might be their issue and not yours
2010-10-13T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	their's meaning the ISP
2010-10-13T04:35:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	well, thanks anyway. I'm sure they are just doing something "clever". You don't happen to know if there is a DHCP ip aquisition timeout setting and how one would go about changing that value?
2010-10-13T04:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	I don't ... however you might try using network manager and "disconnect" the network.. pause.. then reconnect and the computer will request an IP again.
2010-10-13T04:36:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	that's how i used to "fix it" before!
2010-10-13T04:36:00.000Z	suweid		ifup / ifdown
2010-10-13T04:37:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	but now it doesn't work. Oh well. I'll google "internet not working" and die of old age. :)
2010-10-13T04:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	LOL!  what happens if your machine is off.. plugged into the network and is turned back on.. if it works immediately then it's a strange issue..
2010-10-13T04:38:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	no it would still take 3 minutes. Of course I had a router at some point and then everything would work right away, because it would hold the connection. It had an accident involving a plant and a lot of swearing so it's out of commision now.
2010-10-13T04:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	does it happen when more than one machine is plugged into the network in the house at the same time? does it happen if only one machine is plugged in ?
2010-10-13T04:40:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	it happens always, and there's only one jack so i'll go with "one machine".
2010-10-13T04:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	suweid	then you only have 3 choices.. reconnect the way you have been.. google ubuntu dhcp auto refresh timing or something.. or get a new router ..
2010-10-13T04:43:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	I'm going to google until I get gray hair, then I'll consider getting a router. :D
2010-10-13T04:43:00.000Z	suweid	Scunizi	thanks.
