2010-08-23T08:20:00.000Z	asdf_baron		Do you guys have any suggestions as to where I should start troubleshooting for not being able to connect to https websites?
2010-08-23T08:21:00.000Z	zzzed	asdf_baron	 what browser r u using
2010-08-23T08:21:00.000Z	asdf_baron		I've tried midori, chromium, firefox
2010-08-23T08:21:00.000Z	asdf_baron		same problem across the board
2010-08-23T08:24:00.000Z	asdf_baron		local cert problem?  as in certificate?  What would I do about it
2010-08-23T08:27:00.000Z	asdf_baron		do you know what program deals with ssl connections?
2010-08-23T08:28:00.000Z	zzzed	asdf_baron	are you using a router?
2010-08-23T08:28:00.000Z	asdf_baron		I'm straight to my modem
2010-08-23T08:28:00.000Z	asdf_baron		I've eliminated any external fuck up.  Not my ISP, not my router, not my browser.  What else could be going wrong?
2010-08-23T08:32:00.000Z	asdf_baron		I'm thinking ipv6 could have something to do with it.  I was having some problems a while ago and disabled ipv6 in firefox.. That fixed my connection problems temporarily
2010-08-23T08:32:00.000Z	asdf_baron		now whether it's enabled or not I still have this problem
2010-08-23T08:34:00.000Z	asdf_baron		apparently I ca do some https..  I'm conneced to https://wiki.mozilla.org
2010-08-23T08:34:00.000Z	asdf_baron		what doesn't work is logging in.. be it gmail, youtube, msn
2010-08-23T08:36:00.000Z	asdf_baron		It's just me.
2010-08-23T08:37:00.000Z	asdf_baron		:-(  I don't want to reformat or worse, go back to windows because of this.  Is there some command that would reset all my networking or whatever to default?
2010-08-23T08:39:00.000Z	asdf_baron		I have a bunch of libraries for SSL
2010-08-23T08:40:00.000Z	asdf_baron		libcheroekk-mod-libssl libssl-ocaml libssl-ocaml-dev libssl0.9.8 libssl-dev
2010-08-23T08:41:00.000Z	zzzed	asdf_baron	 can u connect to your modem (with browser)?
2010-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	asdf_baron	zzzed	not sure what you mean.
2010-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	asdf_baron		i restarted my browsers, my computer
2010-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	asdf_baron		i can connect to regular http websites
2010-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	zzzed	asdf_baron	your modem has an ip address that you can enter in your browsers address field, e.g http//192.168.0.1
2010-08-23T08:43:00.000Z	asdf_baron		that's a router's address isn't it?
2010-08-23T08:43:00.000Z	zzzed	asdf_baron	your modem has an address, just like a router
