2005-02-18T11:54:00.000Z	eskilo		which file defines what services start up?  i want to stop smbd from starting.
2005-02-18T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	there's no file, there's a directory: /etc/rc2.d/
2005-02-18T11:56:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 those files seem to just link to scripts in /etc/init..
2005-02-18T11:56:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 i see that there's a "samba".  but what file runs "samba start" on boot?
2005-02-18T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	if the symlink exists in /etc/rc2.d/, it will be run.
2005-02-18T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	you may wish to read up on the man pages for update-rc.d and invoke-rc.d
2005-02-18T12:00:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 so if any of those symlinks exist, some startup process will run them with "start" appended?
2005-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	yup.
2005-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 thx
2005-02-19T11:41:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	err...?
2005-02-19T11:41:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	gpg really isn't concerned with aes.
2005-02-19T11:42:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 aes is one of the many options you can use for your key.
2005-02-19T11:42:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	in which version?
2005-02-19T11:45:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	which options did you choose in creating your keypair?
2005-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	eskilo	crimsun	 dsa, el gamal
2005-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	option (1)?
2005-02-19T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	not really a good question.
2005-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	sha256 is passably stronger than sha1
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	increased bits doesn't necessarily indicate stronger security. At all.
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	step back for a second and consider the fact that security is invasive. If someone truly wants it, there's nothing stopping him/her from obtaining it.
2005-02-19T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	that is our _hope_, not reality.
2005-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	and what happens in a (few billion years)+1?
2005-02-19T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	took 10 minutes on a P4 2.4
2005-02-19T12:23:00.000Z	crimsun	eskilo	I have 8192 ones, too.
