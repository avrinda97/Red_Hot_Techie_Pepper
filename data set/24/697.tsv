2011-04-27T21:29:00.000Z	Cody3290		Hello, everyone
2011-04-27T21:29:00.000Z	Cody3290		I think I seriously messed up my HDD. =/
2011-04-27T21:30:00.000Z	Cody3290		Whenever I start up, it loads up grub repair or something like that, and it's like terminal, but nothing I type seems to work.
2011-04-27T21:30:00.000Z	Cody3290		When I try to boot from LiveCD, it tells me No Filesystem Found or something of that sort and gives me BusyBox
2011-04-27T21:30:00.000Z	Cody3290		Is there any way I can recover data from this HDD?
2011-04-27T21:30:00.000Z	Cody3290		And then install something over it again so I can use it?
2011-04-27T21:31:00.000Z	Cody3290		Any help is very appreciated
2011-04-27T21:31:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	so you can't book your liveCD?
2011-04-27T21:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	the liveCD has its own filesystem...  perhaps it's broken
2011-04-27T21:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	try with another live-medium (preferable usb-stick)
2011-04-27T21:33:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	when was this? and what exactly is the problem?
2011-04-27T21:33:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	>3GB (iirc)
2011-04-27T21:35:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	if the CD has this error, you perhaps get the same error on the usb
2011-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	So is there nothing i cna do to fix my HDD?
2011-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	you only mentioned filesystem-error on your liveCD
2011-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	The same basic thing happens when I boot from HDD
2011-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	and if you can't boot your system because of this you have to use some other medium ... like a liveCD
2011-04-27T21:39:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	And neither HDD nor LiveCD works. Is there anything else I can do?
2011-04-27T21:39:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	try other boot-media
2011-04-27T21:40:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	Ok, that brings me to a question I asked before. Can I make  USB of ubuntu from ubuntu itself? I know you can make one with usb_creator.exe but I dont have wine or XP and my internet is very slow at the moment
2011-04-27T21:42:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	for filesystem checks you don't need a big installer like for ubuntu... just filesystem-check/repair tools
2011-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	How would I get that?
2011-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	rumpe1	Cody3290	http://www.ultrabootcd.com/howto.htm   e.g. is just 47MB big
2011-04-27T21:48:00.000Z	Cody3290	rumpe1	THank you
