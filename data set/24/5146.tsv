2007-05-25T09:45:00.000Z	dsnyders		Is it possible to "boot" an iso file from linux?
2007-05-25T09:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 i use vmware or virtualbox to boot iso files to test out live cd's
2007-05-25T09:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 to do what exactly with it?  clarify the real problem :)
2007-05-25T09:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	bknitram, I want to install a distro from an ISO.  The file is on its own drive, and I've got tomsrtbt running.
2007-05-25T09:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 i know of no way to generically boot an .iso image from a live cd. Seen a FEW live cd's specilized where they can boot their own .iso from a hd. but thats a initrd trick i think
2011-09-09T08:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 its reencoding also. thats the time hog.
2011-09-09T08:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 k9copy can be very quick
2011-09-09T08:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	Ripping at 1/13th speed is not really what I had in mind.  Even re-encoding, it seems extraordinarily slow.
2011-09-09T08:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 i can k9copy to iso backup a movie in about 20 min or less
2011-09-09T08:41:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	I'm using a WDTV Live Plus network media player box to send the file to my TV.  It won't read ISO files.  I need some sort of video file like AVI MPEG1/2/4 MKV or something.
2011-09-09T08:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 my wd oplay can play isos ;)
2011-09-09T08:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	It will?  I'll have to give it a try
2011-09-09T08:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 wife does it all the timp. dvd to k9copy.  she plays the iso
2011-09-09T08:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 takes a lit mire space however
2011-09-09T08:47:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	I have a few TB of space, and I'm only interested in a 10 DVD set at the moment.
2011-09-09T08:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 eack dvd - 4gb with k9 copy. then i rip the iso to video later
2011-09-10T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 command &
2011-09-10T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	  bash job controll basics. :)
2011-09-10T16:20:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	You are a fountain of knowledge.
2011-09-10T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 use exit command to  close the terminal window later if you want. avoide using the close button in such a case.
2011-09-10T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 'Using Bash' - a book worth reading. :)
2011-09-10T16:23:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	I'll have to add those two to my bookshelf.
2011-09-10T16:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	dsnyders	 multi sesion disks have alwaysbeen a problem for me in the past. I never use them any more. :) under any os.
2011-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	dr_willis	I think I accidentally wrote a blank session on top of the original.
