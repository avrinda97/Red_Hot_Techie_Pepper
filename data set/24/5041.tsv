2008-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	Packman_e		i suppose the problem is, that now that i have installed linux for the first time, what do I do next?
2008-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	Packman_e		damn xchat
2008-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	Packman_e		i give up
2008-06-28T10:11:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 Huh?
2008-06-28T10:11:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	my xchat keeps on crashing for no reason
2008-06-28T10:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 xchat or xchat-gnome?
2008-06-28T10:13:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	i am not sure, how will i find out, if it helps i am running ubuntu 7
2008-06-28T10:14:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 'sudo apt-get install xchat' and try 'xchat' in the terminal. I dont like xchat-gnome, i just use the normal xchat program.
2008-06-28T10:14:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	is xchat normally a command line program?
2008-06-28T10:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 no its a full gui X based chat program. Xchat-gnome is a simpilified version that most people seem to Hate.
2008-06-28T10:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 running stuff from a terminal, will also print out any error messages/reasons for crashing
2008-06-28T10:20:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	your right it looks like the other xchat, with a few differences
2008-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 and much less damage to your wallet. :)
2008-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	thats ok, Packman_2 is me in chatzilla, and Packman_2
2008-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	thats ok, Packman_2 is me in chatzilla, and Packman_e is me in xchat
2008-06-28T10:33:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	  Python is fairly good and welldocumented for a total-starter to any programing.
2008-06-28T10:35:00.000Z	Packman_e	dr_Willis	i will check that out, i believe python is now supported on symbian phones (eg. nokia n95)
2008-06-28T10:38:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 python is supported on abut anything it seems :)
2008-06-28T10:39:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Packman_e	 its hard to learn 'c' when you havent even grasped the concept of 'variables' and stuff. :) Python books are out that will gently introuduce you to programing fundamentals.
