2012-08-22T02:48:00.000Z	ljack		Hi, Unity sucks.
2012-08-22T02:49:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	so use Gnome 3 or Xfce (my favorite) or KDE 4 or LXDE or plain blackbox/fluxbox/lightbox or MATE or Cinnamon. No shortage of choices at the moment - try stuff till you find something comfy!
2012-08-22T02:54:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	I liked it, yes, but it's dead now. For something similar, use XFCE (my favorite), gnome 3 in fallback mode, or MATE, which is a branch of gnome 2 (but i don't think is natively in synaptic).
2012-08-22T02:56:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	gnome 3 is hugely different from gnome 2, which is dead; I've heard it's very nice, but shares some properties with Unity as well (they're both based on the same stuff).  I personally don't use gnome 3, so it's hard for me to say - I can only really tell you about xfce and unity.
2012-08-22T02:57:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	I like Xfce, do you recommend me using Ubuntu and installing Xfce on top of it, or just using Xubuntu?
2012-08-22T02:57:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	just install xfce on top from synaptic and then new x session, run in Xubuntu mode.
2012-08-22T02:58:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	just be aware that you also have compiz floating around (which is totally fine for xfce, I use the two together), but if your windows come up with no borders, don't panic, just type "xfwm4 --replace" into the run programs dialog.
2012-08-22T03:00:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	if you choose to use compiz or it launches itself, make sure to use ccsm to disable the unity plugin, otherwise it'll try to run unity on top of xfce - if you want to go back to unity, you;ll have to renable it or else things will not work.
2012-08-22T03:01:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	for more help, head over to #xfce
2012-08-22T03:02:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	also be aware that Gnome 3 can be quite mac-like, if you're after that - http://skiesofazel.deviantart.com/art/Orta-184118297 is an example
2012-08-22T03:07:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	I will be right back, I just need to restart my computer
2012-08-22T03:08:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	yeah it's the least configurable thing I've ever seen - even worse than mountain lion os x!
2012-08-22T03:17:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	back
2012-08-22T03:18:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	xperiamaniac's computer only has 512MB RAM and needs to run a different desktop environment because Unity is too heavy.
2012-08-22T03:21:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	this sounds like LXDE or straight openbox/blackbox/fluxbox territory. Anything compositing is going to be agonzing, so unity (compiz) xfce and gnome 3 are all issues.
2012-08-22T03:30:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	You think Xfce is best for him?
2012-08-22T03:31:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	no, I think that lxde is what he really needs.
2012-08-22T03:42:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	No, Win XP can run fine on 512MB.
2012-08-22T03:54:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	there's no way to get a couple more people to come in to help people, is there? we're getting a bit swamped
2012-08-22T03:54:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	Not possible really...
2012-08-22T04:10:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	yeah #debian (pretend you're running debian) or ##linux will have a better bet
2012-08-22T04:11:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	you can add the lxde to ubuntu using wubi?
2012-08-22T04:12:00.000Z	ljack	soliloquy1	No, but you can install Lubuntu using Wubi.
2012-08-22T04:12:00.000Z	soliloquy1	ljack	so essentially do a clean install?
