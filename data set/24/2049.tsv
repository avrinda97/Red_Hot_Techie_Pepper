2009-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	BeWop		Hello, I'm having a problem with my wireless. I recently reinstalled ubuntu 9.04, and last install, it automatically installed the wireless driver. Now, I don't know if it's installed, but I can't get it active either way.
2009-09-07T09:23:00.000Z	BeWop		Does anyone know how to fix this?
2009-09-07T09:23:00.000Z	RHorse	BeWop	you can test this
2009-09-07T09:24:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	What am I testing?
2009-09-07T09:24:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	ok, hold on
2009-09-07T09:25:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/266456/
2009-09-07T09:27:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	How can I find this?
2009-09-07T09:28:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	or can I just not get it?
2009-09-07T09:28:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	wlan0 isn't a command
2009-09-07T09:30:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	it says: "Failed to read scan data : Resource temporarily unavailable"
2009-09-07T09:32:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	That didn't work. If it helps, on my last install, it told me to install drivers to get the card working, but on this install, it didn't work. Same install CD.
2009-09-07T09:33:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	broadcom 802.11 b/g wlan
2009-09-07T09:34:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	Yes
2009-09-07T09:35:00.000Z	RHorse	BeWop	try typing sudo iwconfig ath0
2009-09-07T09:36:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	no such device and interface doesn't support scanning
2009-09-07T09:37:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	I know, but I don't know how to get that one back.
2009-09-07T09:38:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	Possibly. How do I check that?
2009-09-07T09:39:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	Synaptic?
2009-09-07T09:40:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	Hardware Drivers?
2009-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	AH
2009-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	RHorse	BeWop	what is the model of that card?
2009-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	I found the screen that I saw earlier
2009-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	This'll fix it, thanks a lot
2009-09-07T09:42:00.000Z	BeWop	RHorse	Oh, and it's BCM43xx if you were woundering
