2006-08-14T14:47:00.000Z	POVaddct		[Jessica] : grub error 15 indicates that a file is missing. either one of grub's own stage files or one of the files it should boot.
2006-08-14T14:47:00.000Z	POVaddct		[Jessica] : there should be more than just error 15. which file is missing?
2006-08-14T14:48:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	what's the best way to fix this? I have windows on my primary master and ubuntu on my primary slave. I don't really NEED a boot manager because I'm using my  BIOS boot menu to choose what drive to boot from
2006-08-14T14:48:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	no, I just get error 15
2006-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I'm aware of that- I'm just saying, GRUB does not need to worry about booting windows
2006-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I know that
2006-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I didn't say you DID say that was missing.
2006-08-14T14:51:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	no
2006-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I'm booted into the live CD and have the drive mounted to try to fix this shit
2006-08-14T14:58:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	the problem is this thing sees /dev/hdf as hdb which is WRONG
2006-08-14T15:05:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I have a theory
2006-08-14T15:06:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I edited the /boot/grub.lst to say that ubu was on hd(0,0) and it didn't work
2006-08-14T15:06:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I'm not changing the order of my BIOS drives at all...
2006-08-14T15:07:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I'm using the _boot menu_ to tell it to _boot_ from /dev/hdb
2006-08-14T15:08:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	so as far as the BIOS is concerned, the system is booting off hd1,0
2006-08-14T15:08:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	Yeah, I just thought of that :)
2006-08-14T15:08:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	All I have to do is edit the /boot/grub.lst and then reboot, yes?
2006-08-14T15:10:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	If this works, I'ma come back and hug you sweetie
2006-08-14T15:10:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	if not, I'll be back for more help :)
2006-08-14T15:49:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	nope.
2006-08-14T15:49:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	can I msg you?
2006-08-14T15:53:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	shit
2006-08-14T15:53:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	I have to register here?
2006-08-14T15:53:00.000Z	[Jessica] 	POVaddct	crap.
