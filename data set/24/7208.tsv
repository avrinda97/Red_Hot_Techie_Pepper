2005-03-29T16:24:00.000Z	djst		anyone here good at solving problems with the nvidia driver? i'm having a major problem since about the day i installed ubuntu (hoary preview release)...
2005-03-29T16:24:00.000Z	djst		my problem is it just won't start anymore. it worked the first day i installed, then after the package manager had updated packages a couple of hundred times ( ;) ) it just stopped working
2005-03-29T16:25:00.000Z	djst		anyway has any clue whatsoever about the nvidia driver not starting?
2005-03-29T16:25:00.000Z	djst		i'll write a review about ubuntu hoary soon and this is about the only negative part of my install actually
2005-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	in Hoary you mean ?
2005-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 yes, in hoary preview.. and the nvidia driver has worked, but only for one day.. after a reboot it just stopped
2005-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	unless you manually installed the nvidia driver you were probably using the open source nv driver
2005-03-29T16:29:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 no, i changed from "nv" to "nvidia" in xorg.conf, and that made the Nvidia splash screen appear and it started to work
2005-03-29T16:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	ok I also had problem with the latest 2.6??-5 kernel release + nvidia try installing the 2.6.?-4 kernel it worked for me.
2005-03-29T16:31:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	Jesterace:  so the nvidia driver doesn't work with the latest kernel?
2005-03-29T16:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	for me no :(
2005-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	I have a 32 meg GF2MX card and it doesn't work on that kernel release, for me anyways.
2005-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 that's exactly what i have.. almost.. 64 mb i think i have
2005-03-29T16:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	maybe it's card specific, I can tell you that 2.6.10-4-k7 + nvidia work perfectly. You can easily download apt-get install linux-image
2005-03-29T16:37:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 i will try.. i'm surprised it hasn't been downloaded already because I download like 50+ updates every day
2005-03-29T16:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	I mean downgrade your kernel-image so it works with nvidia
2005-03-29T16:39:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 ah i understand.. although i'm not very excited about downgrading the kernel... :(
2005-03-29T16:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	you won't be downgrading just installing the last kernel release, what kernel are you running now (uname -r) ?
2005-03-29T16:42:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	10-5-386
2005-03-29T16:43:00.000Z	djst	LinuxJones	 but there are newer kernel versions out there.. so your suggestion would still be a downgrade, right?
2005-03-29T16:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	ok sudo -s (password) apt-get update && apt-get install linux-image-2.6.10-5-386
2005-03-29T16:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	argh sorry make that -4
2005-03-30T17:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	great :)
2005-03-30T17:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	djst	:)
