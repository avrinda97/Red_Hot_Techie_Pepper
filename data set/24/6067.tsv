2006-01-28T09:05:00.000Z	danno		ok now that the floppy loads after changing <type> auto -> to -> <type> vfat it doesn't let me write to it. What setting do I need to change in /etc/fstab for this? sounds like a permissions issue?
2006-01-28T09:07:00.000Z	danno		this is weird, I've used plenty of Linux distributions and never had this floppy issue
2006-01-28T09:08:00.000Z	danno		why do I have to use sudo to write to a floppy?
2006-01-28T09:08:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	danno	most likely it's mounted with root as the owner
2006-01-28T09:09:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	I can mount it as a user, how may I write to it as a user?
2006-01-28T09:10:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	danno	try adding -o umask=(your umask here)
2006-01-28T09:10:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	do you mean add -o umask=myusername?
2006-01-28T09:10:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	add that to /etc/fstab?
2006-01-28T09:11:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	it says "user" should I change that to my username?
2006-01-28T09:12:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	my user number?
2006-01-28T09:12:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	danno	type id and the number after where it says 'uid=' is your user number
2006-01-28T09:13:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	where do I find the uid info
2006-01-28T09:14:00.000Z	danno	Aaron_Mason	where do I find user id #?
2006-01-28T09:15:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	danno	Open a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal)
