2011-12-20T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	makara	the system itself is the host, if you enable vitualization in the BIOS your virtual systems (the guests) can be 64bit
2011-12-20T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	makara	some CPUs don't support 64bit guests as it needs special instructions, even if the cpu itself is 64bit
2011-12-20T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	makara	both are 32bit, so need nothi9ng special
2011-12-20T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	makara	if you wanted a virtual Fedora 64bit, then you would need the extra virtualization stuffs in yout cpu
