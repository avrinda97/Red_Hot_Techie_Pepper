2007-07-14T13:48:00.000Z	_Lucretia_		anybody installed vmware workstation demo 6 on their machine?
2007-07-14T13:49:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	yes but there are many options for virtualisation
2007-07-14T13:49:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	k, like?
2007-07-14T13:49:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	virtualbox is okay, qemu , xen , vmware and kvm are others
2007-07-14T13:50:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	is xen any good? i.e. can it provide a usual winxp system?
2007-07-14T13:50:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	xen requires a cpu that supports hardware virtualisation to handle winxp i believe, but i use virtualbox for xp and it works great (at least for me)
2007-07-14T13:52:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	so, no 64-bit ubuntu for virtualbox then? :(
2007-07-14T13:52:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	just seen in the faq
2007-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	indeed at the time being
2007-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	in the faq it says as of 1.4.0 it does
2007-07-15T08:11:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	you there?
2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	and many others yep
2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	just been reading this (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo) and it states a note to 64-bit users, do they mean people who want to install a 64-bit OS on qemu or people who are using 64-bit ubuntu?
2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	same for me, im currently using vmware for 64bit hosts
2007-07-15T08:13:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	that is for people who have a 64bit installation, which qemu is installed to
2007-07-15T08:13:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	right, that doesn't seem to make sense though as this is an emulation??
2007-07-15T08:14:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	if you installed 64bit ubuntu, you would use qemu-system-x86_64 command :)
2007-07-15T08:14:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	yeah, I'm on 64-bit ubuntu
2007-07-15T08:18:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	how can I tell (if at all) if qemu is using the kernel module?
2007-07-15T08:18:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	it will become apparant when you run an install :)
2007-07-15T08:18:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	on a new faster machine, so not sure ;)
2007-07-15T08:19:00.000Z	sn0	_Lucretia_	it should say something like Could not open '/dev/kqemu' - QEMU acceleration layer not activated if its not loaded or you aren't in the correct group
2007-07-15T08:19:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	k, must be working then
2007-07-15T08:30:00.000Z	_Lucretia_	sn0	the copying of files is taking it's time...
