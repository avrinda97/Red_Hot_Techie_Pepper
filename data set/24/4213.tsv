2009-07-05T23:46:00.000Z	theblue		I'm trying to install jaunty desktop editon on my HP 1000 series Mini, and there's no sound whatsoever.  Is there any way to get sound to work?
2009-07-05T23:47:00.000Z	theblue		Any advice on getting sound to work on an HP Mini notebook?
2009-07-05T23:48:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	that is
2009-07-05T23:54:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	did you get sound working?
2009-07-05T23:55:00.000Z	theblue	wesley__	i'm running in my windows environment right now, cleaning out for ubuntu.
2009-07-05T23:55:00.000Z	theblue	wesley__	but i tried the live cd earlier today and there was no sound on it.

2009-07-06T00:04:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	so according to this post your audio port should work and not speakers
2009-07-06T00:04:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	checking this would just make sure it's the same bug
2009-07-06T00:04:00.000Z	theblue	wesley__	is there any way to get the speakers to work, though?
2009-07-06T00:04:00.000Z	theblue	wesley__	i know it's the same bug.
2009-07-06T00:05:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	I'm reading more about that now. The first post says that you can build the driver from source to get it to work. The package in the repos needs to be updated
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	follow the post on that page  xapt  wrote on 2009-04-08:  (permalink)
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	wesley__	theblue	if you follow the instructions there, everything should work
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	theblue	wesley__	that link once more?
