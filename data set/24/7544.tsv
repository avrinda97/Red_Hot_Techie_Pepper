2004-12-25T12:53:00.000Z	HcE		How come there is no kernel-image-2.4.28-i386 and kernel-headers-2.4.28?
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		only kernel-headers for m68k
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		may be I'm that's blind
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		doh!
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		right...
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		*look again*
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	HcE		I need 2.4 kernel =/
2004-12-25T12:54:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	why?
2004-12-25T12:56:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	it's about 200 lines, so I think maybe I'll just rewrite the driver for 2.6 kernel
2004-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	put the code on pastebin (http://pastebin.ca/)
2004-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	pastebin.ca really slow?
2004-12-25T13:02:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	http://pastebin.uniformserver.com/pastebin.php?show=27
2004-12-25T13:10:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	fixed one build error :)
2004-12-25T13:11:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	is it tricky work, or easy doable?
2004-12-25T13:19:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	found the next few errors :)
2004-12-25T13:20:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	nice...
2004-12-25T13:23:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	I've got it to build
2004-12-25T13:24:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	nice =)
2004-12-25T13:25:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	that would be excellent
2004-12-25T13:31:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	do I grab wrong or did you paste the old code?
2004-12-25T13:32:00.000Z	njs12345	HcE	I just got it to build perfectly :)
2004-12-25T13:33:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	http://pastebin.uniformserver.com/pastebin.php?show=29
2004-12-25T13:44:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	is the paste-page a bit buggy? I get excactly the same code on your paste and mine
2004-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	HcE	njs12345	thanks for your help, I have to go now! I know it's doable at least :)
