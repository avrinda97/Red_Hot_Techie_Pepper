2007-11-18T11:02:00.000Z	jumbers		Why is it that .WAV files are refusing to play in Audacious under Gutsy? I have the wav plugin installed and enabled, but it will not play them
2007-11-18T11:03:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	Can you play the wav file in something like rythymbox
2007-11-18T11:04:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	Yes, I can
2007-11-18T11:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	That tells me its just an audacious problem.
2007-11-18T11:05:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	I've tried reinstalling it and disabling/re-enabling the plugin to no avail
2007-11-18T11:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	I see other people are having a similar problem. I'll keep looking into it. In the meantime this link suggests that switching to OSS might solve the problem. http://boards.nenolod.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&p=2792
2007-11-18T11:07:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	Won't OSS cause issues with sharing the audio device though?
2007-11-18T11:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	Yes, it probably will. But it may help us narrow down the problem further, and it should be reversible. So it is worth doing just as a test if you like.
2007-11-18T11:07:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	I just changed it to OSS and it still will not play
2007-11-18T11:08:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	ok. Thanks for that info. I'm still looking into it.
2007-11-18T11:08:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	Okay, thank you
2007-11-18T11:08:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	Did you also change your audio settings in addition to your audacious settings? Your audio is probably set to default, but what if it were set to OSS?
2007-11-18T11:10:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	I just changed my system audio to OSS and it still won't work
2007-11-18T11:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	When your done that, switch it back to the original state. Whether it works or not.
2007-11-18T11:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	Ok, see above.
2007-11-18T11:11:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	Okay, I'm back to my original settings. Could it be an issue with the WAV plugin?
2007-11-18T11:12:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	I don't think so... I'm only 20% sure of that though. You say you can't play it, are you opening the file from within audacious, or just clicking on it through thunar?
2007-11-18T11:14:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	I've tried both. When I try to click on the file, I receive an "Open File" window despite the file being set to open with Audacious. If I try to add it directly to Audacious by dragging it into the playlist, it won't add it
2007-11-18T11:15:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	Wait a second, if I go to Audacious and click Add, and then add the file that way, it will add to the playlist and is able to be played
2007-11-18T11:16:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	Ok. I'd read about someone else having that same issue. Very odd. Seems like a bug to me.
2007-11-18T11:20:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	I can't find a bug report on this issue.
2007-11-18T11:21:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	So is this an isolated incident then?
2007-11-18T11:26:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	jumbers	 Today is your lucky day :)
2007-11-18T11:26:00.000Z	jumbers	ArthurArchnix	I'm seeing that :)
