2005-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	pupil		I have a wireless card and I need  to see what chipset it is, in order to use the correct driver,. is it possible to look through dmesg to see what the chipset of the wireless pci card is?
2005-10-28T14:43:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	lspci
2005-10-28T14:44:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	It only shows one ethernet card
2005-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	lspci does not list it,.
2005-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	Hmmm, odd...
2005-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	the card is a wireless card
2005-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	Try "dmesg | less" and see if it shows up there
2005-10-28T14:48:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	 the light doesnt even come on at boot
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	And you're sure it works?
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	yes., it works
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	What brand?
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	i'm doing lspci on an older system,. P133 isa board
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	dwl-g510
2005-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	'k hang on
2005-10-28T14:51:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	Okay, seems like you need ndiswrapper to get this one working
2005-10-28T14:55:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Ubuntu
2005-10-28T14:55:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	umm, ndiswrapper ... I thought I needed madwifi,. anyway,. I have to flex,. BTW,. what I'm trying to do is create a syslinux and add Atheros driver to it to detect my wireless card and then do  network boot
2005-10-28T14:56:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	First get it working, then you can work your way around syslinux
2005-10-28T14:57:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	I can use syslinux to netboot ltsp ?
2005-10-28T14:57:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	Never tried that... but you can use netboot if you don't have PXE
2005-10-28T14:58:00.000Z	pupil	NiGhTHiNG	I use etherboot right now,. it detects my card but I want to see if I can do a wireless netboot,.. can I use netboot for that as well?
2005-10-28T15:00:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	Wow, that's a tough one - I never did a wireless netboot... but it sounds interesting to try :)
2005-10-28T15:00:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	pupil	That's uncharted grounds for me, man. Google?
