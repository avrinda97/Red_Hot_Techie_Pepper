2009-07-29T20:33:00.000Z	ramavadakattu		if i specify a cron job with * * * * *   what does it mean ? (basically i want to run the script every time)
2009-07-29T20:34:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	every minute?
2009-07-29T20:34:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: i want the script  to run again as soon as it completes
2009-07-29T20:35:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	Then that will do it.
2009-07-29T20:35:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	Thanks
2009-07-29T20:35:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	Another solution might be an endless bash script.
2009-07-29T20:36:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	that way, the next invocation starts after the program finishes.
2009-07-29T20:37:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: ok but i need initiate that script  manually  on my production server so iam thinking to go with * * * * *
2009-07-29T20:37:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	With the crontab, you might get several instances running at the same time.
2009-07-29T20:37:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: ok
2009-07-29T20:38:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	Funny things, these computers...
2009-07-29T20:38:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	Production? Oh, dear.  Please be careful.
2009-07-29T20:39:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	:oh...... ok   Can't i prevent multiple instances? i just want another instance to start only after the first gets complete
2009-07-29T20:40:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	Then the bash script is a possibility.
2009-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	:  ok but i don't know scripting language :( will try to learn
2009-07-29T20:41:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	I'm not too familiar with bash.  Perhaps someone else can help you with this.
2009-07-29T20:42:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: sure  i will figure it out no problem
2009-07-29T20:43:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	man bash
2009-07-29T20:44:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: yes will do that
2009-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	stercor		ramavadakattu:
2009-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	stercor		       while list; do list; done
2009-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	stercor		       until list; do list; done
2009-07-29T20:45:00.000Z	stercor	ramavadakattu	while 1 do ... done
2009-07-29T20:46:00.000Z	ramavadakattu	stercor	: ok thanks will do that
