2011-06-01T14:19:00.000Z	pratz		hey guys i am trying to install mp4 but getting an error
2011-06-01T14:20:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	What do you mean trying to install MP4? What package are you installing?
2011-06-01T14:21:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	theadmin: http://gpac.wp.institut-telecom.fr/2011/04/20/compiling-gpac-on-ubuntu/   this is the package i am trying to install
2011-06-01T14:22:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	but as i do not have root access i am trying to compile it in my home directory
2011-06-01T14:22:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	Use sudo...
2011-06-01T14:22:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	http://eitwebguru.com/how-to-install-mp4box-on-linux-server/ to do that i am following
2011-06-01T14:22:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	i do not have supre user powers , i am on webfaction shared hosting
2011-06-01T14:23:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	You're trying to install program to transcode video files into mp4 containers?
2011-06-01T14:24:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	as somewhat like that, my friends team require this package
2011-06-01T14:25:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	that means i can not install it on this machine
2011-06-01T14:25:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	Most probably, yes.
2011-06-01T14:26:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	you mean to say , first compile it on my local mahcine and then the compiled directory should be host on webfaction ??
2011-06-01T14:27:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	No. Like I said, you probably won't be able to compile it on the site, and you almost certainly won't be able to run it.
2011-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	what you mean to convert and then upload ??
2011-06-01T14:29:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	Your friend can install MP4Box on his computer, use it on the video files to get them in MP4, and then upload and store them on the website which I assume is your end goal
2011-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	hey it is automated and is somewhat an online tool
2011-09-15T16:47:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	That would probably show if it was running. Or service --status-all to list active services
2011-09-15T16:50:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	but when did not this worked sudo netstat -tanp | grep ':25'
2011-09-15T16:50:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	That would only work if your mail server was actually connected somewhere
2011-09-15T16:51:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	ok
2011-10-17T18:57:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	No. IP is your computer's IP (or what you want it to be), subnet mask will typically be 255.255.255.0 for a home network, gateway is your router and DNS is the IPs for a DNS server somewhere, try 8.8.8.8 for Google's DNS servers
2011-10-17T18:59:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	Change them to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in that order
2011-10-17T18:59:00.000Z	pratz	Polah	means ?
2011-10-17T19:00:00.000Z	Polah	pratz	Change your two DNS IPs to those two...
