2006-12-25T15:54:00.000Z	jimmygoon		thanks
2006-12-25T15:55:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	sudo passwd <user> is the only way that I know of to do it is by using root powers
2007-01-27T09:17:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	sudo aptitude hold <package>
2007-01-27T09:19:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	I tried that and when I rebooted it pegged it as an upgrade again
2007-01-27T09:23:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	its not working
2007-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	http://pastebin.ca/679443 don't mind the edgy repos think iit's when I upgraded the upgrade just comments the edgy repos
2007-09-03T06:30:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	it seems to be part of boost
2007-09-03T06:31:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	through my readings it is a bug that debian had because of timing, and it appears ubunut inherited it
2007-09-03T06:31:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	I've been putting off compiling the new version of boost from source for a while now, but I have no choice now
2007-09-03T06:33:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	I see libboost-serialization1.33.1in syaptic
2007-09-03T06:36:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	so in fact ubuntu does have it
2007-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	WHAT
2007-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	what version of ubuntu do you have?
2007-09-03T06:39:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	7.04
2007-09-03T06:40:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	can you cat your repositories to a pastebin for me. sorry for the trouble, but I don't have the right repo
2007-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	any chance you installed those via deb... I replace my sources.list with yours and its still not finding it....
2007-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	did you update?
2007-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	yep
2007-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	no I just did a search in synaptic and it came right up
2007-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	gah! I'm out of ideas.. lemme search the packages.ubuntu.com page
2007-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	jimmygoon	kitche	it doesn't show up : http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=libboost&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all
2007-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	sure it does libboost-serialization-dev
2007-12-03T09:32:00.000Z	kitche	jimmygoon	it needs qt to run
