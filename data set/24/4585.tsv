2009-08-22T17:43:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 but it doesnt work on the apple movie trailer site
2009-08-22T17:43:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	check if .mov is listed in the about:plugins
2009-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 it sure is  version 7.2.0
2009-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 these movies play fine  http://www.spacetoday.org/STOmovies.html
2009-08-22T17:46:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	is it telling you something like text/html decoder not installed?
2009-08-22T17:47:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 yes it is
2009-08-22T17:49:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 is there a solution to this?
2009-08-22T17:52:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	I am still looking
2009-08-22T17:52:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	I came over this error myself now
2009-08-22T17:52:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 cool... I have googled allnight :)

2009-08-22T18:01:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	since all other quiktime stuff works
2009-08-22T18:01:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 apprently apple is peeved   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1245441&page=3
2009-08-22T18:02:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	however it seems that totem does not understand the text/html from the site...which is making me a bit confused...this would probably work with mplayer
2009-08-22T18:02:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 no it wont work with mplayer either...this is apple  changing the site requirement so that others cannot access the trailers
2009-08-22T18:02:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	common problem then
2009-08-22T18:05:00.000Z	scizzo-	coz_	I have no idea then....
2009-08-22T18:05:00.000Z	coz_	scizzo-	 no problem
