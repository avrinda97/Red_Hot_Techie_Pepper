2010-12-19T00:06:00.000Z	deddly		OK This guide says: "Make sure an ~/.asoundrc file exists." It doesn't exist, can I just make a document in AbiWord and save it there? What format should I save in?
2010-12-19T00:08:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	you can try $touch .asoundrc
2010-12-19T00:10:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	Typing $touch .asoundrc returns "command not found"
2010-12-19T00:14:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	try 'type touch' and tell me what you see
2010-12-19T00:15:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	ok... "touch is in /usr/bin/touch"
2010-12-19T00:16:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	so typing 'touch .asoundrc' doesn't work? don't type the dollar sign
2010-12-19T00:17:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	"permission denied" should I "sudo touch .asoundrc"?
2010-12-19T00:18:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	yeah
2010-12-19T00:18:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	ok... nothing happened...
2010-12-19T00:19:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	'ls -al', a .asoundrc should be created
2010-12-19T00:19:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	i'm afraid not, i'm not that great at it :(
2010-12-19T00:21:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	oh right... Yes I see it in the "ls -al" list, but I can't see the file when I look at the folder, even showing hidden files
2010-12-19T00:22:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	So how can I go in and edit the file if I can't see it to click on?
2010-12-19T00:23:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	if ls -al shows it's there, it's there
2010-12-19T00:23:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	in the terminal, 'nano .asoundrc'
2010-12-19T00:23:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	or use whichever text editor you like
2010-12-19T00:27:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	I think it's in the wrong place - I need the file in /home/currentuser
2010-12-19T00:28:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	hmm, try 'touch ~/.asoundrc' . i guess you created the file in the wrong folder
2010-12-19T00:32:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	It's so wierd, I can't see .asoundrc
2010-12-19T00:34:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	weird, if ls -al shows that it's there means it's created
2010-12-19T00:34:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	ok this is embarrasing...I found it, sorry - was looking at folders not files (blush)
2010-12-19T00:34:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	lol! okay.
2010-12-19T00:35:00.000Z	deddly	infinitus	Thanks for the help
2010-12-19T00:36:00.000Z	infinitus	deddly	no prob :)
