2009-04-30T18:02:00.000Z	wtl		are all evolution configurations contained in .evolution or is there any other folder?
2009-04-30T18:03:00.000Z	coleys	wtl	in .evolution only
2009-04-30T18:03:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	ooh. i preserved my old .evolution before i upgraded to jaunty but evolution is still running the startup assistant. any idea why?
2009-04-30T18:04:00.000Z	coleys	wtl	hmm, im pretty sure evo has a feature for backup.
2009-04-30T18:08:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	yeah but you have to manually back configurations up
2009-04-30T18:08:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	since i havent, will my old .evolution just be void?
2009-04-30T18:27:00.000Z	wtl		there's no problem with receiving mail from my gmail account on evolution but I can't send email. my sending doesnt progress. any idea? :)
2009-04-30T18:27:00.000Z	coleys	wtl	via imap, or pop?
2009-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	coleys		oh..
2009-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	coleys		smtp... you need to change port to 587... tls
2009-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	receiving via pop. sending via smtp :)
2009-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	coleys	wtl	Yeah, change the smtp port to 587, and the security to tls.
2009-04-30T18:29:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	oh. at last, one of my two messages are already sent. it seems that it's just taking much time. right?
2009-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	coleys	wtl	If they sent, then you have no problem :]
2009-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	wtl	coleys	where can i change the smtp port?
