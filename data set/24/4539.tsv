2007-03-17T10:25:00.000Z	mfd		Is it wise to install fiesty fawn?
2007-03-17T10:25:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	not really
2007-03-17T10:25:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	Why not
2007-03-17T10:26:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	it's still in alpha stage and very volatile (prone to breakage)
2007-03-17T10:26:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	I'm coming from a Gentoo background, I'm not sure I'd be fussed enough to download 6:10 when 7.04 comes out next month.
2007-03-17T10:26:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	well my Feisty just broke so i may be biased
2007-03-17T10:27:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	it freezes at "mounting local filesystems.." i assume it's a feisty problem, ive never seen it anywhere else.  additionally, my Edgy still boots fine
2007-03-17T10:27:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	:[
2007-03-17T10:28:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	you can give it a shot though, chances are you wont have the same problem as I
2007-03-17T10:28:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	this is the only case i've heard of it, though probably not many people using Feisty have rebooted in awhile ;P
2007-03-17T10:28:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	Yes, but it would still have problems.
2007-03-17T10:29:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/daily/current/
2007-03-17T10:29:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	Thanks.
2007-03-17T10:29:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	latest semi-stable herd 5 is available here http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/releases/feisty/herd-5/
2007-03-17T10:31:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	there are like 50 updates a day in Feisty (at least sometimes)
2007-03-17T10:31:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	Hmm..
2007-03-17T10:31:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	so when you say you have slow net i'm not sure it's a good idea...unless you just dont want to update it
2007-03-17T10:32:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	Nah, I can go to a friends house to make regular updates.
2007-03-17T10:33:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	not sure, why?  is the http unsuitable?
2007-03-17T10:33:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	I prefer ftp.
2007-03-17T10:34:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	livecd daily FTP ftp://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/cdimage/daily-live/current     alternate textmode install daily FTP  ftp://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org/cdimage/daily/current/
2007-03-17T10:34:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	if you prefer ftp because it lets you resume, well not all ftp servers support resume so dont count on it
2007-03-17T10:35:00.000Z	xtknight	mfd	the livecd for feisty also lets you install to disk although it has no text mode installer
2007-03-17T10:36:00.000Z	mfd	xtknight	That's fine.
