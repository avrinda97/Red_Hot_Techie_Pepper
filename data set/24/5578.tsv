2006-06-12T14:53:00.000Z	TassaDarK		anybody with Sound Blaster Extigy can play 2 (or more) audio channels at once? (i mean, 2+ programs using the sound card at once)
2006-06-12T14:54:00.000Z	TassaDarK		if i'm playing xmms, i can't play sounds in totem for example
2006-06-12T14:55:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	yes, you can, but you need to use plug:dmix explicitly because we didn't enable dmix by default for usb sound devices in Dapper.
2006-06-12T14:56:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	there are technical reasons I chose not to, namely different devices react very badly to having dmix enabled by default due to device quirks (many usb audio devices ... "stretch" the spec).
2006-06-12T15:00:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	that statement is wordly awkwardly and is imprecise.

2006-06-12T15:02:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	the root of the issue is that many usb sound devices are manufactured from designs that exceed (a.k.a. break) the usb audio spec, so the alsa driver has to hard-code quirks into the driver for them. These quirks assume certain values that, when dmix is enabled, cause the device to appear to perform poorly. Thus I (since I handle much of the audio in Ubuntu kernels) decided not to enable dmix by default just for convenience. A pr
2006-06-12T15:03:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	does my last statement clarify the rationale?
2006-06-12T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	just use plug:dmix. It's already included.
2006-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	e.g., ``aplay -Dplug:dmix /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
2006-06-12T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	look at the dmixplugin page on alsa2.opensrc.org
2006-06-13T05:14:00.000Z	TassaDarK	crimsun_	i have been reading all this stuff about dmix plugin (http://alsa2.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin) and i have a BIG mess in my head. What is the easiest and simple way to have dmix enabled for all applications using sounds, i mean have multichannel/duplex (or wherever it calls) audio enabled forever?
2006-06-13T05:17:00.000Z	TassaDarK	crimsun_	?
2006-06-13T05:18:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	echo 'pcm.dmix0 { type dmix  ipc_key 2048  slave { pcm "hw:0,0"  period_size 1024  buffer_size 4096 } }  pcm.!default { type plug   slave.pcm "dmix0" }  ctl.dmix0 { type hw  card 0 }' > ~/.asoundrc
2006-06-13T05:19:00.000Z	TassaDarK	crimsun_	i write that in the console?
2006-06-13T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	copy and paste it verbatim
2006-06-13T05:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	I can't predict the future. Furthermore, if I don't answer right away, it's probably because I'm at work and can't respond.
2006-06-13T05:21:00.000Z	TassaDarK	crimsun_	it works now, lot of thanks! if works after reboot i WANT a child yours

2006-06-13T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	workaround: ``apt-get install alsa-oss'' (in universe), then use ``aoss opera''
2006-06-13T05:43:00.000Z	TassaDarK	crimsun_	the solution you gave me before is for all applications or applications using alsa, or aoss or what?
2006-06-13T05:44:00.000Z	crimsun_	TassaDarK	the workaround works for /some/ oss-only applications.
