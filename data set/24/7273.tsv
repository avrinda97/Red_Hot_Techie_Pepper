2005-04-27T15:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	I do not concur that file extentions make the application :)
2005-04-27T15:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	and there I will agree with you :)
2005-04-27T15:19:00.000Z	Zugot	ompaul	oh and i tried to use dia..  after converting some large drawings over, i just find it isn't as easy to use
2005-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	I do not use it for large work, so I can't comment on that, however I have used it and found it fast and responsive. how many objects did you have in the large drawings?
2005-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	Zugot	ompaul	i have a viso doc with about 500 objects
2005-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	okay that might be interesting :)

2005-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	Zugot	ompaul	nah...   not really... its a work document with specific ips....
2005-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	fine - but now I know it is a network map on visio I can go to some windows people and ask them to build me a network in it :)

2005-04-28T14:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Zugot	in terms of what occupies the home directory
2005-04-28T14:54:00.000Z	Zugot	ompaul	isos for about 3 different distros... the kde source tree and other projects
