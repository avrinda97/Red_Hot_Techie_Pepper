2006-06-05T13:13:00.000Z	philippic		Hello - would anyone care to help me set my clock with NTP?
2006-06-05T13:14:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntulinux.com  should do it.
2006-06-05T13:15:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Thanks - I was thinking about running ntpd, but maybe I'll just script ntpdate instead.
2006-06-05T13:15:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	Use cron and run ntpdate daily.  Unless you need super precise time, the daily drift of a few seconds shouldn't be a problem.
2006-06-05T13:17:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	I have ipw2200 too, works out the box for me too.
2006-06-05T13:18:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Upgrade from breezy.
2006-06-05T13:19:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	I just wish I knew what steps I could take to debug this.
2006-06-05T13:20:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Hmmm. I wonder if you've overwritten something trying to install it manually?
2006-06-05T13:21:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	Maybe, but it didn't work at all after I upgraded and rebooted, so whatever I overwrote wasn't correct in the first place.
2006-06-05T13:22:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	What does uname -r say for you?
2006-06-05T13:22:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	2.6.15-23-386
2006-06-05T13:23:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Probably :)
2006-06-05T13:23:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	I asked you a question in private too, about whether the module is loaded.
2006-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	I didn't get it for some reason.  Bu the module is loaded.  lsmod | grep ipw shows ipw2200, ieee80211, ieee80211_crypt and firmware_class
2006-06-05T13:25:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Unload the module with modprobe -r..
2006-06-05T13:25:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	which one
2006-06-05T13:25:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	and load it again. See what dmesg or kern.log says.
2006-06-05T13:25:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	I'd try modprobe -r ipw2200
2006-06-05T13:26:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	ipw2200-bss.fw request_firmware failed: Reason -2
2006-06-05T13:26:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	Maybe I have the wrong firmware version installed.
2006-06-05T13:27:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	That's a good start then...
2006-06-05T13:27:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	Yes.  Good usggestion.  Thanks
2006-06-05T13:29:00.000Z	philippic	jjazz_	Google thinks you have the wrong firmware version..
2006-06-05T13:31:00.000Z	jjazz_	philippic	Yes, I'm googling the error now too.  What page are you looking at?
