2011-01-21T22:49:00.000Z	under		Hello everyone. I have a serious problem: I find it very difficult to read the characters, which does not happen on windows. I state that I use the same resolution and frequency of the monitor even in the operating system. Thanks so much for the answers.

2011-01-21T22:52:00.000Z	undecim	under	Again: A screenshot would be quite helpful
2011-01-21T22:52:00.000Z	under	undecim	I posted it.

2011-01-21T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	under	The screenshot is perfectly clear. It has to be a problem with your monitor or video drivers
2011-01-21T22:56:00.000Z	under	undecim	yes, I think so.
2011-01-21T22:56:00.000Z	undecim	under	I see you're using an NV card.
2011-01-21T22:57:00.000Z	under	undecim	NV? Btw, I dont think the monitor is the problem becouse I thought it was the monitor then I changed it but I've got the problem anyway
2011-01-21T22:57:00.000Z	undecim	under	NV = Nvidia
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	under	undecim	SÃ¬
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	undecim	under	Do the colors seem distorted?
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	under	undecim	no
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	undecim	under	Or is it blurry?
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	under	undecim	what?
2011-01-21T23:00:00.000Z	under	undecim	yes, a bit
2011-01-21T23:01:00.000Z	undecim	under	I don't know what would fix it
2011-01-21T23:01:00.000Z	under	undecim	can you help me to remove nvidia driver?
2011-01-21T23:02:00.000Z	undecim	under	It looks like youre running Fedora... Sorry, I don't know the procedure for removing the nvidia driver from fedora
2011-01-21T23:02:00.000Z	undecim	under	Perhaps #fedora can help you with that.
