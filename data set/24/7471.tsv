2004-11-14T15:56:00.000Z	lev		anyone running vsftpd here?
2004-11-14T15:57:00.000Z	lev		i have a set of users that can login and a set that can't -- I'm having trouble figuring out why vsftpd is discriminating between the two sets...
2004-11-14T15:58:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	check what groups that the users that can log in are a part of and see if the ones who can't might be excluded from like a 'ftpers' group ... be a good place to start, not sure thos
2004-11-14T15:59:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	can you suggest where to look for that? I've checked /etc/ftpusers and /etc/vsftpd.conf...
2004-11-14T15:59:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	/etc/pam.d/vsftpd refers back to /etc/ftpusers, too...
2004-11-14T16:00:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	i'd cat /etc/group and look at the groups that users that can login fin, and those who can't see if you see a pattern
2004-11-14T16:01:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	the entries in /etc/group look quite similar -- no significant difference.
2004-11-14T16:02:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	do this test, create a new user now, and see if it can ftp in
2004-11-14T16:02:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	hang on...thanks for the help, btw...
2004-11-14T16:03:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	np
2004-11-14T16:03:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	nope, new user ftptest can't login...my maintenance account doesn't have a problem though.
2004-11-14T16:04:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	do I need to restart the ftp server so it knows users created since it executed? that would be odd...but the only difference between the two groups is that stsunx existed before i started vsftpd
2004-11-14T16:05:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	then there must be a list of 'allowd' users somewhere if you didn't notice anything odd lookign in /etc/groups
2004-11-14T16:05:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	that's what i'd think, but i've checked all the ones i know...
2004-11-14T16:05:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	worth a shot, but I can't see that working, sec, im gonna install it here and take a peak, i only use sftp on my servers
2004-11-14T16:06:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	i avoid ftp in general -- we need a regular old ftp set up here at work to distribute class files. i'd love to just use ssh...i know that a lot better... :-)
2004-11-14T16:07:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	when you installed vsftp, did it give you the option of using mysql stored accounts?
2004-11-14T16:09:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	gee...I really don't remember.
2004-11-14T16:10:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	i'm pretty sure my vsftpd isn't set up like that, but i'm not certain
2004-11-14T16:11:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	you've looked in vsftpd.ftpusers right ?
2004-11-14T16:13:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	oh my. i do apologize -- no, I didn't. i looked in /etc/ftpusers and at the pam entry...i don't remember there being a vsftpd-specific user file. but I guess there is.
2004-11-14T16:13:00.000Z	lev	Cuga_	thanks for the trouble -- i feel silly that it was such a trivial answer.
2004-11-14T16:14:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	np :)
2004-11-14T16:15:00.000Z	Cuga_	lev	story of my life haha, i'm always looking for bigger issues then are acktually at hand.. burned me a few times haha
