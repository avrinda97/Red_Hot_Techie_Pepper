2008-05-07T13:50:00.000Z	kelvin911		i thought the gradient is missing icon
2008-05-07T13:50:00.000Z	kelvin911		i thought miss icon is something else
2008-05-07T13:50:00.000Z	kelvin911		i guess the gradient is the right icon
2008-05-07T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911		i guess the mist icon is right
2008-05-07T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911		i am not a designer
2008-05-07T13:53:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	I get that mist icon here in Beijing whenever it's polluted :)
2008-05-13T14:17:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio
2008-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	if i remove it will all my app has no sound?
2008-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	probably, unless you install alsa or something
2008-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	is it giving you trouble?
2008-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	how to install the one gutsy uses?
2008-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	that's alsa, so it should be in the package manager
2008-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	in gutsy i can play mp3 and play games at the same time but in hardy i cant
2008-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	ah, try alsa then
2008-05-13T14:25:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	i dont get it
2008-05-13T14:25:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	is there a more detail instruction how to use the old sound system in gutsy?
2008-05-13T14:28:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	well, I'd start with seeing if switching off Pulse by the directions provided there helps, and if it does, then worry about removing it
2008-05-13T14:37:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	someone gave youthe command up above, I think
2008-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	update-rc.d, I think
2008-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	kelvin911	adam7	u sure that wont break alsa driver?
2008-05-13T14:39:00.000Z	adam7	kelvin911	it's working now, right? you can undo that command too if you want
