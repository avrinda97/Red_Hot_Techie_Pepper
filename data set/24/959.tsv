2011-03-15T21:38:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	no, specifying a uid won't make any sense in that case.
2011-03-15T21:38:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	what about an username ?
2011-03-15T21:38:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	no difference.
2011-03-15T21:39:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	so when i get a access denied by server
2011-03-15T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	either the server or the client is configured badly.
2011-03-15T21:40:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	hmm....i don't have a password on the NAS so what else can it be ?
2011-03-15T21:40:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	i do mount -t nfs 192.168.1.55:uTorrent /media/uTorrentNFS
2011-03-15T21:41:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	is the server configured to permit access from your machine?
2011-03-15T21:41:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	the server is not set to restrict anybody if that's what you ask
2011-03-15T21:42:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	the question is whether it *permits* anybody.
2011-03-15T21:42:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	yes it does
2011-03-15T21:42:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	you've verified that on another machine?
2011-03-15T21:42:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	no, i can't because then ill have to do mount as well
2011-03-15T21:42:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	uh, what?
2011-03-15T21:43:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	i mean how would i try it ? i have a mac but i have not tried to do mount on that one
2011-03-15T21:43:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	so when you said "yes it does"...
2011-03-15T21:44:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	it's something i believe it is, of course i cannot know for sure, i have looked thru the settings of the NAS and i can't find something that indicates that
2011-03-15T21:50:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	what does the documentation for the NAS say?
2011-03-15T21:52:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	they don't specify how to mount the nas from ubuntu with NFS
2011-03-15T21:53:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	which NAS are you using?
2011-03-15T21:53:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	Netgear Readuynas NV+
2011-03-15T21:55:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5737&view=previous
2011-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	donnib	sipior	Places -> Home folder ? on the web interface ?
2011-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	sipior	donnib	one imagines so.
