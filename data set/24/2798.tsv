2009-02-18T12:00:00.000Z	spree		I have an issue. I have an OOOOOLD Automatix installation. I installed Swiftweasel with it. I want to remove swiftweasel and install the new version properly. I am running Intrepid. I also need to uninstall Automatix and have no clue how to go about doing it
2009-02-18T12:01:00.000Z	spree		remember Automatix? from 7.10? I still have it and i want rid of it
2009-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	spree	yes, we *never* supported automatix
2009-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	spree	tritium	what do you want me to do
2009-02-18T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	spree	anything you like
2009-02-18T12:03:00.000Z	tritium	spree	we've always strongly advised against it
2009-02-18T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	spree	the point was to provide you the background on the reasons why
2009-02-18T12:07:00.000Z	spree	tritium	i was looking forward to finding out something i don't already know. So far, i'm disappointed.
2009-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	spree	tritium	i do know this whole "impossible to remove it" thing has got to be bunk and a cop-out
2009-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	tritium	spree	if it were official ubuntu software in the repositories, you might have reason to complain to us
2009-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	spree	tritium	Show me where I complained
2009-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	tritium	spree	it's unfortunate you chose to install unofficial software, and now want to blame us, as if it was in some way something we did
2009-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	tritium	spree	your previous two comments
2009-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	spree	tritium	so far you've had the supposition that I am both some kind of Automatix adovcate that needs talking out of using it after the damage is done, and that I am here to whine about it. I came here for some sort of recommendation beyond what somebody at Dell tech support in India would say with Windows "Okay, we'll just reinstall your entire operating system that will fix it"
2009-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	spree	I've had no such supposition, there's just nothing we can recommend for you
2009-02-18T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	spree	nonsense
2009-02-18T12:14:00.000Z	spree	tritium	actually you'd be amazed at what you can accomplish over the phone
2009-02-18T12:15:00.000Z	tritium	spree	it's not reasonable to demand support for random, third-party, unofficial software
2009-02-18T12:15:00.000Z	spree	tritium	show me where i said i'm responsible.
2009-02-18T12:16:00.000Z	tritium	spree	drop it.
2009-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	tritium	spree	spare us, and stay on topic, please
2009-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	spree	tritium	show me where i'm not on topic
2009-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	tritium	spree	drop the attitude
2009-02-18T12:34:00.000Z	spree	tritium	I don't know what you mean. Please stay on topic.
