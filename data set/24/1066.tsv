2010-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	basix-		i'm a dummie when i come to it
2010-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	basix-		i have the server running
2010-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	basix-		but cannot connect to it from my windows machine
2010-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	using putty?
2010-08-23T04:46:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	what you trying to use?
2010-08-23T04:46:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	do yourself a favor..  get  putty
2010-08-23T04:46:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	its free
2010-08-23T04:47:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	i don't think telnet and ssh are the same thing
2010-08-23T04:48:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	i'm a newbie but have gone thru all this and i'm a windows user from wayback
2010-08-23T04:50:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	there are 2 types of IP addresses
2010-08-23T04:51:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	static and dynamic
2010-08-23T04:51:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	static stays the same.. dynamic can change
2010-08-23T04:52:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	DHCP assigns dynamic ip addresses
2010-08-23T04:53:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	DHCP ip addresses come from you ISP
2010-08-23T04:54:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	well in theory you'll get a new ip address whenever you reboot your router.. but my isp usually gives me the same IP
2010-08-23T04:55:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	you just can't count on it..
2010-08-23T04:55:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	but your router most likely has DHCP server in it too
2010-08-23T04:56:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	with most routers i believe you can have both
2010-08-23T04:57:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	let the router give each device a dynamic IP.. but you can assign a static one if you want
2010-08-23T05:00:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	what makes this a bit more confusing.. is that you have 2 ip addresses.. one between you isp and router..  and one between router and devices connect to it
2010-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	how many PC's connected to you router?
2010-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	basix-	itsux2bu	2 pcs
2010-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	itsux2bu	basix-	good.. thats a network..
