2010-03-09T06:24:00.000Z	dolley	sebsebseb	billiard-GL, foolbilliard, rise the triad, freedroid rpg. they just cna't be opened, no response at all
2010-03-09T06:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	oh right 3D games
2010-03-09T06:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	ok I guess you don't have your graphics card driver installed system > administration > hardware drivers
2010-03-09T06:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	then those games will probably work
2010-03-09T06:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	is there a graphics card driver available?
2010-03-09T06:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	oh
2010-03-09T06:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	Any idea which graphics card you have?
2010-03-09T06:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	oh ATI those can be a pain on Ubuntu
2010-03-09T06:49:00.000Z	dolley	sebsebseb	i'm trying to installed a driver for ATI, but having trouble. The result is: gedit has not been able to detect the character coding.
2010-03-09T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	are you brand new to Ubuntu or?
2010-03-09T06:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	ok  I don't have ATI card :)  I just been here enough time to know they can be a pain.  Wait a bit, ask your question again or something here, and someone else will be able to help you properly.
2010-03-09T06:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	it's unfortuante that you end up with a  reason to mess around  with that, one of the first things you do,  and all, because of lack of manufacutre support.
2010-03-09T06:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	I think next Ubuntu will have some sort  of good open source driver built in for ATI and Nividia,  but maybe not good enough for  those games.
2010-03-09T06:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	Now is a good time to ask your question  to the whole channel,   and then again in like 10 minutes, if you don't get a reply.
2010-03-09T06:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	they do, but not properly
2010-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	as for freedom, we mean software freedom,  so programs that have their source code available to the general public, so proggrammers from all over the world can contribute and make better
2010-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	also most of those volunters won't get paid for it
2010-03-09T07:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	you can try the forums as well
2010-03-09T07:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dolley	ok no problem,  you can probably get it working,  just need someone that can help properly with that, so good luck with that
