2007-12-13T04:56:00.000Z	mindy		I've got the nvidia module loaded, but xorg keeps failing with "nvidia" (module does not exist, 0)
2007-12-13T04:56:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	go to a pastebin and paste the text in the /var/log/X0rg.0.log file
2007-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	or you can just upload it from the page at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-12-13T05:00:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48014/
2007-12-13T05:06:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	were you able to view my pastebin url ?
2007-12-13T05:07:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	hang on
2007-12-13T05:07:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	sorry...no rush. "nv" driver okay for now.
2007-12-13T05:08:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	try sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2007-12-13T05:08:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	more info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2007-12-13T05:09:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	it may help to mention that I'm running the 2.6.17-11 image...not 2.6.22
2007-12-13T05:10:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	another alternative would be to remove all nvidia related packages and build it by running the install script directly from nvidia's home apge
2007-12-13T05:11:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	i'm cool with that, but won't i need sources for 2.6.17-11 installed on my Gutsy?
2007-12-13T05:14:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	yup, if you compile it you will need the headers
2007-12-13T05:15:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	can i apt-get those?
2007-12-13T05:15:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	yup
2007-12-13T05:16:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	apt-cache search `uname -r` headers
2007-12-13T05:17:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	i'd suggest putting some effort into getting ti working with packages first
2007-12-13T05:17:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	there are a number of issue in connection with running your own build inclusing having to rebuild the module each time you upgrade kernel
2007-12-13T05:17:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	have you done a sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new ?
2007-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	yea..it's downloading the 2.6.22 kernel image at the moment
2007-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	btw disabling usb keyboard/mouse in your bios might remove your boot issue :)
2007-12-13T05:20:00.000Z	kling0n	mindy	I'm going to go to sleep pretty soon... please focus on getting the precompiled modules to work for you first unless you are comfortable compiling and disabling specific modules from the modprobe sequence
2007-12-13T05:24:00.000Z	mindy	kling0n	if I disable USB support, I actually get to a splash-screen but it still hangs.
