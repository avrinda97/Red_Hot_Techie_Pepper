2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	I'll try
2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	k
2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	can you add the command line column?
2010-02-03T13:38:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	how are you monitoring this?
2010-02-03T13:39:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	and it has no name?
2010-02-03T13:39:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	Indeed. it is also using 'N/A' memory
2010-02-03T13:40:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	sometimes it dissapears and comes back, also killing it just restarts the ID number
2010-02-03T13:40:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	that *is* odd. Its PID changes or remains the same?
2010-02-03T13:40:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	? It is constantly changing. It gradually increases its number.
2010-02-03T13:42:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	add the 'command line' column to the process view
2010-02-03T13:42:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	it's very hard to view one thing with all the columns, it constantly moves processes up and down :S
2010-02-03T13:43:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	it's probably sorted by activity... change the sorting to name or something else that's static
2010-02-03T13:45:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	no PID there
2010-02-03T13:45:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	it is a bit futile stating it, as it constantly changes
2010-02-03T13:46:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	27319, 27414, 27513
2010-02-03T13:46:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	are you sure its the PID you are watching and not some spawned processes?
2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	also sometimes another process with the same problem (no name random PID) starts up but thne gets killed v. quickly
2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	how do I do that?
2010-02-03T13:47:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	oh lol I did, yeah it is empty
2010-02-03T13:49:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	can you pastebin the output of 'ps -ef'
2010-02-03T13:52:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	Slart: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m2a618577
2010-02-03T13:52:00.000Z	asdff	nowonmai	Slart: Also in my startup applications list I have an invisible entry I can uncheck/check but I cannot remove.
2010-02-03T13:58:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	nothing looks amiss in that... it's possible that gnome-system-monitor is misbehaving
2010-02-03T14:02:00.000Z	nowonmai	asdff	can you pastebin the output of 'ls -la /etc/init.d' pls
