2011-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	Night		Hey anyone knows how to deal with ''sha1sum mismatch! Rename /home/admin/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2008/vcredist_x86.exe and try again.''??
2011-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	Night		And how to delete it? o.o
2011-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	Night		Soz, I'm totally a newbie. =/
2011-06-14T12:42:00.000Z	Night		I don't know where to find the file. O.o
2011-06-14T12:42:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	rm /home/admin/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2008/vcredist_x86.exe
2011-06-14T12:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	/home/admin/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2008/vcredist_x86.exe  is the path
2011-06-14T12:43:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	just open a terminal and type     rm /home/admin/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2008/vcredist_x86.exe
2011-06-14T12:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	everything fine when nothing comes out
2011-06-14T12:46:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	rm is a command to delete and when everything is fine rm is deleting the file without any error-message
2011-06-14T12:46:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	if you retype the command, you should get /home/admin/.cache/winetricks/vcrun2008/vcredist_x86.exe not found
2011-06-14T12:46:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	because the file was deleted before
2011-06-14T12:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	correct
2011-06-14T12:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	as it seems the first download was not successfull because the hashsum was incorrect
2011-06-14T12:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	no
2011-06-14T12:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	yum is only for opensuse not f√ºr ubuntu
2011-06-14T12:50:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	use this "sudo apt-get install winetricks"
2011-06-14T12:51:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	openuse is another linux-distribution like ubuntu, debian, redhat und univention corporate server
2011-06-14T12:51:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	is another process running like software-center?
2011-06-14T12:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	what you want to run with wine?
2011-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	of course a program... :)
2011-06-14T12:54:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	depending if you need the update-process
2011-06-14T12:55:00.000Z	iceroot	Night	there you can have a look if your program is supported and what steps are to do
