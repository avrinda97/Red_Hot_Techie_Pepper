2006-12-30T12:56:00.000Z	sushi_		I need to set up my home wireless network.   The Network Configuration tool allows me to enter the SSID that I receive the Internet from, but I also need to broadcast inside my home to other computers.  How would I do this?
2006-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	sushi_		For example I connect to the internet from a wifi ssid "Pop"    but I also need to broadcast inside my home SSID "Coke"
2006-12-30T12:58:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	you want to connect to two different wireless networks?
2006-12-30T12:58:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	don't you need two cards for that?
2006-12-30T12:59:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	I want to broadcast and receive at the same time.   I did this in XP using the Wireless Wizard.
2006-12-30T13:00:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	generally, I want to use my computer as a
2006-12-30T13:01:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	ok, i'm no expert on wifi, but i really think you need 2 cards to be a wifi router
2006-12-30T13:01:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	again, I did it in another OS.   Worked great, but I don't want to use that OS anymore
2006-12-30T13:01:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	oh.  neato.
2006-12-30T13:02:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	not really, I want to use ubuntu 'full time'
2006-12-30T13:03:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	a simple answer would be to somehow get myself 2 devices for my one wifi card.   so far all i have is eth1, but if i had wlan1 and eth1, I could configure it.
2006-12-30T13:05:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	with an ethernet card you can do aliasing so you get eth1:0 and eth1:1 and you can assign different IP addresses to each fake interface.  maybe something like that exists for wifi
2006-12-30T13:06:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	that'd work great.       Is it strange that my wifi card is showing up as ethernet?   It's a popular card.
2006-12-30T13:06:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	on my laptop, my ethernet is eth0 and my wifi is eth1, so i guess it's not too unusual
2006-12-30T13:06:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	it depends on what the drivers make it
2006-12-30T13:07:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	neat.     can youo show me in the right direction to aliasing the device?
2006-12-30T13:07:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Alias/index.html  <-- try this?
2006-12-30T13:08:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	i'm just googling "linux ip aliasing"
2006-12-30T13:08:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	thanks you helped.
2006-12-30T13:11:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	i just want him to see what partitions exist
2006-12-30T13:11:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	haha...thanks, i should have looked that up
2006-12-30T13:22:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	he has a windows drive mounted, but it says readable only by root
2006-12-30T13:23:00.000Z	plypkie	sushi_	like   mount -o umask=000 -t vfat /dev/hdc5 /mnt/d
2006-12-30T13:23:00.000Z	sushi_	plypkie	yes
