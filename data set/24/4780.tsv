2009-03-05T04:08:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	I love grub too
2009-03-05T04:08:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	ilovebrownies wants to have access to his arch install too
2009-03-05T04:09:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	what are you doing the setup cmd for?
2009-03-05T04:10:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	is ubuntu's grub installed? or arch
2009-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	and I was explaining him how to chainload the arch grub so he doesn't have to change his ubuntu menu'lst everytime arch updates
2009-03-05T04:13:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	is grub installed on arch?
2009-03-05T04:13:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	I have never done chain loading before
2009-03-05T04:14:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	is grub on arch?
2009-03-05T04:15:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	you there?
2009-03-05T04:15:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	sorry
2009-03-05T04:16:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	was here
2009-03-05T04:16:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	I gave him instructions how to install grub to his arch /boot partition
2009-03-05T04:16:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	from ilovebrownies' comments I assume he has an arch install that uses grub
2009-03-05T04:16:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	to do what?
2009-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	normally you isntall grub to the mbr
2009-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	but you can't use two different configs with just one grub install
2009-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	I know, but if you are chainloading, you need to install it to /boot on arch
2009-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	I know
2009-03-05T04:17:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	yes, so I explained him how to install grub to his arch /boot :P
2009-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	and that's where he is now
2009-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	tekteen	mycroes	isn't there an easy package to install grub in arch?
2009-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	he has grub installed in arch
2009-03-05T04:18:00.000Z	mycroes	tekteen	he just needs to install it to the arch /boot partition, because normally it gets installed to the mbr so you can use it...
