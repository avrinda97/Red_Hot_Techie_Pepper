2007-09-28T12:56:00.000Z	alex_		I installed WINE but i can't find it anywhere on my system...whats' up with that?
2007-09-28T12:57:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	wine isn't generaly used through GUI. type wine <filename.exe> to launch windows exe
2007-09-28T12:58:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	yep
2007-09-28T12:58:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	Thanks a lot!
2007-09-28T12:58:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	not everything runs well under wine and sometimes you need to play with the config etc
2007-09-28T12:59:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	Yea i was assuming it woudnl't be foolproof or anything. Just want to try running OneNote for school ;)
2007-09-28T12:59:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	:/ OneNote won't work even under CrossoverOffice. I have tried. Wish it did
2007-09-28T13:00:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	Noooo :'(
2007-09-28T13:00:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	What further stinks is that there is realy no good replacement for Linux. I have been using google notepad but :/
2007-09-28T13:01:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	yea i'm just using the word processor from openoffice but it's nothign like onenote
2007-09-28T13:01:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	not at all like it. I LOVE oneNote
2007-09-28T13:02:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	i wonder if anybody'll work on a replacement for onenote? :)
2007-09-28T13:03:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	I hope so.
2007-09-28T13:06:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	it basicly lets you build html content a little faster. Nothing like OneNote but it is a great package
2007-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	look at BasKet, might be worth a try...
2007-09-28T13:11:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	you get that? look at BasKet as a onenote replacement :)
2007-09-28T13:11:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	I hadn't seem that one. Looks promising. I don't have time to check it out now but thanks for the link
2007-09-28T13:12:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	yup :)
2007-09-28T13:13:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	I have looked at all the packages that the basKet homepage mentions it imports from and they all fall short in one way or another :/ basKet actually looks good though
2007-09-28T13:13:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	yea it looks as close as it gets for now
2007-09-28T13:16:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	wow thanks. I just went ahead and installed and launched it and at first glance it looks awsome. Even if it doesn't turn out to be oneNote, is damn sure beets google notepad :)
2007-09-28T13:17:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	yea i just launched it too.... quick note: pushing the - key before typing makes a Bullet...(i found that very important hha)
2007-09-28T13:17:00.000Z	alex_	acecase	and if you want to make bullets on new lines just push Ctrl or Shft plus Enter
2007-09-28T13:18:00.000Z	acecase	alex_	great find. I have to run but I certainly appriciate it.
