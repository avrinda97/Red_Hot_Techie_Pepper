2007-09-28T13:56:00.000Z	Terminus		can somebody please paste the results of route from their box?
2007-09-28T13:56:00.000Z	Terminus		i can ping the LAN but i can't get on the net. =(
2007-09-28T13:57:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	does your network use dhcp?
2007-09-28T13:58:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	nope. static.
2007-09-28T13:58:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	have you got your dns set up properly?
2007-09-28T13:58:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	everything is set in /etc/network/interfaces
2007-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	yes. i can ping the dns server from the other box, but not from this box.
2007-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	not necessarily. try, 'ping 64.233.167.99'
2007-09-28T13:59:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	nope. doesn't work.
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	what error are you getting?
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	22 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 21010ms
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	er, I meant before that. ping should give off an error for each packet.
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	i can't ping beyond the NAT.
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	nope. just blank
2007-09-28T14:00:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	then you've a problem with your gateway
2007-09-28T14:01:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	hmmm... shouldn't be. box that's running irssi is behind the same gateway.
2007-09-28T14:02:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	can you ping that box?
2007-09-28T14:02:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	yep, i can.
2007-09-28T14:02:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	can you access that box? reissue the ping I gave before there.
2007-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	sorry, no ping there.
2007-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	maddash	Terminus	"no ping"?
2007-09-28T14:03:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	i can ping from another box behind the gateway though. it works fine.
2007-09-28T14:04:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	i can't ping using the gateway. it's an off the shelf NAT.
2007-09-28T14:04:00.000Z	Terminus	maddash	there's this weird line in the routing tables though --> link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0
