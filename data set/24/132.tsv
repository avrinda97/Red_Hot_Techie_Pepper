2012-05-22T17:44:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	hey mate. can you post the output of $ lspci | grep VGA
2012-05-22T17:45:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	iea,
2012-05-22T17:46:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	were we talking earlier?
2012-05-22T17:46:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	noup, my first time here :)
2012-05-22T17:47:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	ok, this is for the rest of the room, but someone else had the same card earlier 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Juniper [Radeon HD 5700 Series]
2012-05-22T17:48:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	it's probably a cheap card ;p
2012-05-22T17:49:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	you running open or proprietry?
2012-05-22T17:49:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	installed the additional drivers
2012-05-22T17:49:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	do you get the same behaviour with both?
2012-05-22T17:50:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	let me see the version ...
2012-05-22T17:50:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	didn't installed the others , but the problem with the unlock had it with the propetary drivers also in 11.10
2012-05-22T17:51:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	i solved alot of my dramas with the 2d desktop. still running it now
2012-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	it may solve the problems, but is not how i like to use it, but i'll try, no fix arround?
2012-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	let me check if 2d solves something
2012-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	then i'm going to instal propetary drivers :)
2012-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	thanks :)
2012-05-22T17:53:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	if you've tired 2 different drivers and have the same issue, then i say it's not the drivers. I'm NOT a linux guru or ubuntu expert, that just makes solid sense to me
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	it didn't resolved the problems with the scroll on the screen
2012-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	does the down arrow scroll down?
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	iep, just a part of the window, like if there's a box
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	wait, when you say scroll, you mean its all over the place flickering?
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	nitzer_	Snowie[noobspert	something like that,
2012-05-22T18:02:00.000Z	Snowie[noobspert	nitzer_	when did you first get this problem
