2007-05-02T08:32:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	what are you using to calibrate?
2007-05-02T08:33:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	pSX and Mupen64, im running kubuntu, but noone in #kubuntu could help so i thought id drop by here, i cant find an os calibration suite
2007-05-02T08:34:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	check out jscalibrator
2007-05-02T08:34:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	its in feisty repos, but it is GTK, take what you can get though
2007-05-02T08:34:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	ok let me try that, is that the package name?
2007-05-02T08:35:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	installing now
2007-05-02T08:37:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	and sudo apt-get installing that doesnt work?
2007-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	lol seams to work fine now, except that i need three more buttons :(
2007-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	jscalibrator is not giving me enough buttons
2007-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	there is another package called joystick
2007-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	try that?
2007-05-02T08:41:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	ok will try
2007-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	its reading the triggers as axis
2007-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	well its so smart
2007-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	the triggers ARE axis
2007-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	then why wont mupen pick them up?
2007-05-02T08:45:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	who knows, but those triggers are pressure sensative and thus are axis
2007-05-02T08:48:00.000Z	surgy	DBO	is there anyway to use them as just regular buttons?
2007-05-02T08:48:00.000Z	DBO	surgy	im sure there is but I would be the wrong person to ask
