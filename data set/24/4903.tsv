2007-08-03T14:44:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	thats how i back up...
2007-08-03T14:45:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
2007-08-03T14:45:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	overkill
2007-08-03T14:45:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	easiest thing for me to figure out when i first did it :p
2007-08-03T14:45:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	your copying tons of empty stuff too
2007-08-03T14:46:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	besides: Did you ever try a restore???? Every backup is only as good as the restore procedure ....
2007-08-03T14:46:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	i still havent figured out how to do future backups. im thinking rdiff-backup
2007-08-03T14:46:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	yes of course
2007-08-03T14:47:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	thats what i did when i sent my comp to get fixed. i dd'd it to my external drive, booted from that drive on school computers so i could have my stuff, then dd'd it back when it came back from being "fixed" (they reinstalled windows....isnt that just breaking it worse?)
2007-08-03T14:48:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	well .... for as long as it works for you. But "dd" takes bloody ages. I personally put my stuff into *.tar.gz archives, which means I am far more flexible when it comes to restores. E.g. the disks don't have to be identical and don't even need to be partitioned the same way. With "dd" you don't have much choice .....
2007-08-03T14:48:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	you cant boot from a tar though, can you?
2007-08-03T14:49:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	I don't need to :-P
2007-08-03T14:49:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	what if the drive dies then?
2007-08-03T14:49:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	any minimal live CD will do
2007-08-03T14:50:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	e.g. the Ubuntu Live CD is perfect for such stuff .... I always have one with me.
2007-08-03T14:50:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	it only takes a couple hours. i just started it then went to sleep
2007-08-03T14:50:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	with tar it takes me like 45 minutes to pack my full system ....
2007-08-03T14:50:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	but this way i was able to carry my hard drive around and boot school computers from it and have my settings and all
2007-08-03T14:51:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	same here ... I just use a live CD and then can access my stuff inside the archive if I need to
2007-08-03T14:51:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	the livecd has its own default settings though and it doesnt have the apps that you install on your own (after the system)
2007-08-03T14:52:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	well, for backup + restore I don't need that stuff anyway. For everything else there is USB HDD's and USB sticks.
2007-08-03T14:52:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	what do you backup to? i backup to a usb hard drive
2007-08-03T14:53:00.000Z	scorp123	macogw	I have a bunch of 400 and 500 GB disks here, and at work I use DLT tapes
2007-08-03T14:53:00.000Z	macogw	scorp123	isnt the write life on tapes shorter than on drives?
