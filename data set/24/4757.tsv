2007-01-15T15:18:00.000Z	fokuslee		will this work with sudo?
2007-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	please use a pastebin :) thank you
2007-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	ok sorri i got lazy : )
2007-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	sudo sets the UID to 0 .. so, i think thats a yes to your question
2007-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	errm, thats not a wise thing to say/do -- the pastebins exist for a good reason
2007-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 you need to install the lsb modules :)
2007-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	in 6.06 they were installed by default rite? but not in edgy?
2007-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 can you learn how to live a lifestyle? no, you just go with it, each day presents its own hurdles, you seem to learn .. but everyone at a differrent pace and different things
2007-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	oh lol thats wut flannel meant its more philosophical i was talking about wut i should get first mcse cert or linux cert
2007-02-06T12:34:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	im trying to get an IT job
2007-02-06T12:34:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 well, if you want my honest opinion .. the world of computing is dominated by microsoft, so its definitely worth getting an MCSE (or a couple of MCPs)
2007-02-06T12:35:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	yeah ur soo rite even in my workplace which is OEM for riverbed still 99 percent M$ and the IT admin barely knows linux
2007-02-06T12:35:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	but linux is more interesting to learn
2007-02-06T12:36:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 but again, linux is emerging at a fast pace .. so a couple of linux certs will help , especially now that companies are trying to interoperate microsoft and *nix ..
2007-02-06T12:37:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	kk thx abunch mate oh does vista still use 3 letter extensiton?
2007-02-06T12:37:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 linux came along a long time after msdos was being phased out -- msdos is derived from cp/m (which is derived from unix tho)
2007-02-06T12:37:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	yeah ur rite linux is 1991 i meant unix
2007-02-06T12:38:00.000Z	unop	fokuslee	 most definitely -- its how windows identifies files/formats -- an .exe or .dll cannot be so without the extentions
2007-02-06T12:39:00.000Z	fokuslee	unop	ok thx for all ur help time for bed
