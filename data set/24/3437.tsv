2008-07-09T17:39:00.000Z	pen		anyone know why nautilus can't refresh?
2008-07-09T17:39:00.000Z	pen		sometimes when I do some renaming or symlinks, nautilus won't show the correct output
2008-07-09T17:40:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	clicking reload doesnt work either?
2008-07-09T17:40:00.000Z	pen		Bollinger, reload?
2008-07-09T17:40:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	reload?
2008-07-09T17:40:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	what do you mean
2008-07-09T17:40:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	there's a reload button on the navigation bar
2008-07-09T17:41:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	or you can press ctrl+R
2008-07-09T17:41:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	it happens for me too, sometimes nautilus just doesnt refresh automatically
2008-07-09T17:41:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	doing that or closing/reopening the window does the trick though
2008-07-09T17:41:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	oh, I haven't. Like if I use sudo nautilus, then chaning the file name will give different name under terminal
2008-07-09T17:42:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	feels like nautilus doesn't really changing the name
2008-07-09T17:42:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	is that what you experienced?
2008-07-09T17:42:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	i dont do sudo nautilus
2008-07-09T17:42:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	then what did you use? just terminal?
2008-07-09T17:42:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	i guess
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	well, sometimes I prefer gui
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	for basic stuff i just go on using the gui though
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	im not sure about running it as root
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	I was tring to change my default cursor
2008-07-09T17:43:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	and apprently update-alternatives is not working properly
2008-07-09T17:44:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	it deletes the symlink to /usr/share/icons/default
2008-07-09T17:44:00.000Z	pen	BoltClock	I'm really confused.
2008-07-09T17:44:00.000Z	BoltClock	pen	well... so am i
