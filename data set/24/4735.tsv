2007-03-10T10:22:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	you can get it that way with compiz or beryl, but that involves a lot of installing and figuring stuff out
2007-03-10T10:22:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	yeah i know that, but it needs a faster GraphicCard then mine.
2007-03-10T10:23:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	what do you have?
2007-03-10T10:24:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	intel graphics..
2007-03-10T10:24:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	I run compiz on my laptop with an intell 85565 (or soemthing like that card) just fine, it's a 1.6 pentium M
2007-03-10T10:25:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	using the i810 xorg driver
2007-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	im using that too
2007-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	compiz froze once in here..
2007-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	i dont like a lot of eye candies tho
2007-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	well compiz and beryl are both alpha, but it's the only wayt to get true transparency, you can run one of them with all plugins off except the transprency ones
2007-03-10T10:27:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	id like to try that.
2007-03-10T10:31:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	beryl is a fork of compiz. I feel it's buggier, but has more features
2007-03-10T10:32:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	ill go for compiz tho
2007-03-10T10:33:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	I did it the other day by just installing the compiz package "sudo aptitude install compiz" then replacing metacity with compiz: "compiz --replace"
2007-03-10T10:34:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	make sure you have direct rendering first: "glxinfo | grep direct"
2007-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	ever heard about direct renderin showing on and off if i kill X ? i have it now, if i contrl alt backspace.. and start again i dont have it anymore.. and after altctrl backsp again, i re-have it :S !? any idea ?
2007-03-10T10:36:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	no not at all :-(
2007-03-10T10:36:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	what about compiz and xgl with intel graphics ?
2007-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	what do you mean? just install the compiz package and go, I wouldn't worry about XGL, no need
2007-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	if "compiz --replace" says you dn't have the composite extention then you need to add the composite extention to your xorg.conf
2007-03-10T10:38:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	run compiz without XGL at all ?
2007-03-10T10:38:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	yes, the i810 driver has the right opengl extention and xorg past 6.8 has the composite extention, you don't need XGL
2007-03-10T10:39:00.000Z	albacker	kelsin	can i apply compiz in fluxbox or jsut gnome ?!
2007-03-10T10:40:00.000Z	kelsin	albacker	talk in #ubuntu-effects now
