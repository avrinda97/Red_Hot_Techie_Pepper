2006-11-10T09:17:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu		Can anyone help me?
2006-11-10T09:17:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Perhaps.
2006-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	well.. I think my nVidia G-force card doesn't like ubuntu lol
2006-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	That's cause it works on a proprietary driver
2006-11-10T09:18:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Are you able to log in?
2006-11-10T09:19:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	nope, you get a error, and than it goes to root on the livecd
2006-11-10T09:19:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	Failed to
2006-11-10T09:19:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	Failed to start the X server ( your graphical interface ) It is likely that it is not setup correctly, would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?
2006-11-10T09:20:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Is it a FX5500?
2006-11-10T09:22:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Do you have nvidia-kernel-common installed?
2006-11-10T09:23:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	whyy would I have it installed, when I can't even get to livecd, to INSTALL the os
2006-11-10T09:23:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	I see.
2006-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Would you be able to set up internet access from the command prompt?
2006-11-10T09:29:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	You could try installing using the Alternate CD
2006-11-10T09:32:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Try installing with the alternate cd. Then you at least have ubuntu installed on the system, and you can work from there.
2006-11-10T09:34:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Or you can use Freespire, a Debian-based OS with KDE as a shell, and *lots* of proprietary drivers. It could save you the hassle.
2006-11-10T09:34:00.000Z	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Munchkinguy	I think Jordan has a point, I could install from graphical safe mode, install nvidia drivers there, and then see how it goes :0
2006-11-10T09:35:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	LGKeiz-Ubuntu	Have fun
