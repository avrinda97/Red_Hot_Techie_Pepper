2006-01-19T12:23:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	what are you doing to try to get them
2006-01-19T12:24:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	do the other gui admin tools work?  try synaptic for example
2006-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	has it ever worked?
2006-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	is this a new install?  did you use server install?
2006-01-19T12:26:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	what wouldn't connect?
2006-01-19T12:28:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	okay I don't really understand what you are saying but let's assume you did a normal install.  Open a terminal: accessories -> terminal.  What does the command 'sudo echo hi' do?
2006-01-19T12:33:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	underscore then jason: _jason for my highlight to work please... I need a new name :/
2006-01-19T12:35:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	paste what the command 'groups' returns
2006-01-19T12:36:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	yeah thanks
2006-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	I need to see everything :)
2006-01-19T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	just copy and paste (hightlight it and then go to xchat and middle click)
2006-01-19T12:42:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	it should, no harm in trying
2006-01-19T12:44:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	we're going to need to add you to the admin group so you get sudo privileges.  Do you have access to root?  Do you remember creating a root password?
2006-01-19T12:45:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	this account you are on now is the account you created during install?
2006-01-19T12:47:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	try to guess the root password.... type: su, and guess your common ones.  Tell me if you can't figure it out.
2006-01-19T12:49:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	when you respond put my name in front cus I'm going to be reading something and won't notice unless you do, thanks
2006-01-19T12:52:00.000Z	chuck_	_jason	what if the administration password and user acount password is the same
2006-01-19T12:52:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	that's fine.  were you able to login to root?
2006-01-19T12:53:00.000Z	chuck_	_jason	no i am wondering if i did put a root password in, cause it didn't work
2006-01-19T12:54:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	okay we can still take care of this problem.  Do you have a livecd?
2006-01-19T12:54:00.000Z	chuck_	_jason	yes
2006-01-19T12:54:00.000Z	_jason	chuck_	boot with the livecd and come back here
