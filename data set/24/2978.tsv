2009-08-17T16:32:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	ok
2009-08-17T16:23:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	I need backup /usr because I want mount it to another partition (I can't use backup programm on LiveCD)
2009-08-17T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	could boot to live cd and use cp to copy it over
2009-08-17T16:25:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	I fear that there would be errors with permission. Am I wright? Did you do what you advise?
2009-08-17T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	if you look at the man pages for cp i think theres one to preseve
2009-08-17T16:30:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	So If I copy with sudo /usr and boot in LiveCD won't permission on files changes?
2009-08-17T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	i think theres a switch for cp to not change and ownerships
2009-08-18T11:51:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	I'v seen that (blkid and vol_id) are reflecting exist information about devices but not change.
2011-03-23T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	the new one does
2011-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	data dvd I'm guessing?
2011-08-17T21:43:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	No, I bought a film
2011-08-17T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	then you don't mount it
2011-08-17T21:45:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	aha. I've made the first paragraph. Hope the last part will be more useful
2011-12-07T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	you can mount it anywhere except in /proc
2011-12-07T09:21:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	yes. I know. But what is the correct place? "/media" is for removable devices. "/mnt" is for temporary mounted file system.... What else? Where should be mounted permanet file system?
2011-12-07T09:22:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	I read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
2011-12-07T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	again, literally anywhere you want
2011-12-07T09:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	you can make a subfolder in /media and use that if you want
2011-12-07T09:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	/mnt can be used to mount ANYTHING, you can run:  sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt    and it will work
2011-12-07T09:25:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	Oh!! I didn't know thank you
2011-12-07T09:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	there is no "that folder is for that reason", whoever told you that is wrong
2011-12-07T09:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	gvfs is just configured to use folders in /media to, that's all
2012-01-21T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Besogon	yes, works here just dandy
2012-01-21T10:29:00.000Z	Besogon	ActionParsnip	For me not works. hp-plugin says that I need local installation of the printer. It doesn't catch samba printers. The printer is connected to Wondows computer
