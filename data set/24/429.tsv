2011-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	imadam		A message comes up saying: The instaler encountered an error copying files to the hard disk: [Errno 5] input/output error. - This is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk....
2011-09-07T09:22:00.000Z	imadam		Any advice?
2011-09-07T09:24:00.000Z	imadam		I was able to get linux mint up and running, so its not a hard drive issue?
2011-09-07T09:26:00.000Z	imadam		How can I run a check to verify its md5?
2011-09-07T09:26:00.000Z	imadam		Its a DVD-R CD.
2011-09-07T09:27:00.000Z	imadam		Thanks guys, going to try the lower speed and see what happens. I had an older linix mint version on a CD I was able to install onto the desktop, so doesn't look like an HD issue.
2011-09-07T09:29:00.000Z	imadam		How do I load up terminal in 11.04? I'm a noob and been running 10. somthing for a looong time.
2011-09-07T09:31:00.000Z	imadam		Thanks guys.
2011-09-07T09:32:00.000Z	imadam		Thats very true. The main reason while I'll never change back to Windows.
2011-09-07T09:33:00.000Z	imadam		I'm on my works computer (sadly they run windows) is InfraRecorder any good when it comes to burning disks?
2011-09-07T09:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	its great. Remember to burn as slowly as possible
2011-09-07T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	its not cli based
2011-09-07T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	the keyring isn't used for updates. That's your login password
2011-09-07T19:45:00.000Z	imadam	ActionParsnip	got ya! Although everytime I try and install new apps and stuff I'm asked for a password, anyway for me to turn that off?
2011-09-07T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	no, not in ubuntu
2012-09-21T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	which video chip?
2012-09-21T02:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	try the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
2012-09-21T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	did you install the nvidia proprietary driver?
2012-09-21T02:12:00.000Z	imadam	ActionParsnip	nope I didn't,
2012-09-21T02:12:00.000Z	imadam	ActionParsnip	Just can't boot now, nothing will load on my screen.
2012-09-21T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	try the nouveau.blacklist=1 option
2012-09-21T02:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	hold SHIFT at boot is a start
2012-09-21T02:13:00.000Z	imadam	ActionParsnip	would it work if I just do a fresh install via cd then insall the driver?
2012-09-21T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imadam	sure but you already have the install. If you boot to root recovery mode you can just run:  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current      and it will install
