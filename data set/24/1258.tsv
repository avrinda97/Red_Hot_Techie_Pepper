2010-05-03T00:17:00.000Z	Electric|Master		For some reason my cd drive isn't mounting automatically. I tried to mount it myself, but it apparentally doesn't have a file system... I tried setting it to iso9660 and it said "mkfs.ext2: invalid blocks count - /dev/cdrom"
2010-05-03T00:17:00.000Z	Electric|Master		What should I do? :|
2010-05-03T00:17:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	mkfs? why are you calling mkfs to mount it?
2010-05-03T00:18:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	noo... I'm trying to set a file system so I can mount it.
2010-05-03T00:18:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	why would using mkfs help?
2010-05-03T00:19:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	ok...
2010-05-03T00:19:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	is this a blank cd you are trying to write files to? if so you're doing it wrong
2010-05-03T00:19:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	no, I'm just trying to get it to mount. There's already something on it
2010-05-03T00:19:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	mount -t iso9660
2010-05-03T00:20:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	could it be something to do with this?
2010-05-03T00:22:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	could that be the problem...?
2010-05-03T00:27:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	could be
2010-05-03T00:27:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	does it work with other disks?
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	Here I'll check. I think it's a problem with DVD support, possibly... It's a DVD-R
2010-05-03T00:28:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	it does work with other disks.
2010-05-03T00:30:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	does this disk work on other machines?
2010-05-03T00:31:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	yes
2010-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	yeah it works with other disks
2010-05-03T00:43:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	is your drive a DVD-R drive?
2010-05-03T00:43:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	or aDVD drive
2010-05-03T00:43:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	DVD-RW :)
2010-05-03T00:48:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	so any ideas?
2010-05-03T00:52:00.000Z	Random833	Electric|Master	i just said i don't have any more ideas
2010-05-03T00:53:00.000Z	Electric|Master	Random833	oh ok
