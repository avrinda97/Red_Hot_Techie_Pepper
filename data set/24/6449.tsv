2005-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	transgress		is us.archive having problems?
2005-11-29T10:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	 yes its down
2006-01-19T12:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	its probibly removing them to install the new ones
2006-01-19T12:24:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	these are the new ones i think.
2006-01-19T12:24:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	and apt-get doesn't find any newer packages...
2006-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	you should be fine if you match some of the things its removing with some that is being installed
2006-03-26T16:59:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	that doesn't answer my question.  i know that much.  what i'm asking, is what is it gonna do about the bt package i install?
2006-03-27T17:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	you can remove it
2006-03-27T17:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	its not gonna affect anything
2006-06-18T13:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	pretty unstable IMHO and last i heard they are looking at summer of 2007 before it becomes stable
2006-06-18T13:35:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	okay.  i was just wondering.  i don't have a great urge to use it.
2006-06-18T13:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	i used to
2006-06-18T13:38:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	not anymore?  i was wanting help on configuring it.  the shortcut to switch to it is <alt>s by default, do you happen to know what it is to make it alt+space?
2006-06-18T13:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	no udev is messed up on this pc and it removed gnome
2006-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	if you know what your doing or read the instructions im thinking its fairly easy
2006-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	okay.
2006-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	let me go find those... i'm guessing a wiki somewhere?
2006-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	if you run the 32bit ubuntu you never have to worry about it ;)
2006-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	amd64 runs faster on my lappy... i've tried them both.
2006-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	its either on the ff1.5 wiki or the restrictedformats wiki i cant remember you can always look for a chroot wiki
2006-06-18T14:19:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	don't have to chroot anymore IIRC
2006-06-18T14:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	transgress	i thought you still did  <i stay away from 64bit>
2006-06-18T14:25:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	nope.  don't have to.  i just downloaded 32bit flock and it works fine
2006-06-18T14:47:00.000Z	transgress	gnomefreak	spectacular
