2011-09-16T18:06:00.000Z	jpmh		I have just plugged a planar touch screen into my computer - dmesg tells me that it sees it and I have loaded the evtouch driver - still not able to touch the screen - what am I missing?
2011-09-16T18:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	USB?
2011-09-16T18:07:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 yes - usb
2011-09-16T18:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	does lsusb sees it?
2011-09-16T18:09:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 yes0 sees it as Quanta Computer Inc
2011-09-16T18:11:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	So to summarise, screen is working but not reacting to touch?
2011-09-16T18:11:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 YES - very sucinct
2011-09-16T18:11:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 and I would add that dmesg and lsusb both show it
2011-09-16T18:12:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	can you give me the complete model?
2011-09-16T18:12:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 planar px2230mw
2011-09-16T18:13:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	did you install drivers?
2011-09-16T18:14:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	Am looking ad planar.com and they have section for Linux Touch Screen Drivers. Did you get them from there?
2011-09-16T18:14:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 evtouch yes - nothing else - never needed anything else when using them in the past - what else may I need
2011-09-16T18:14:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	Oh, so the screen worked but it's not working now?
2011-09-16T18:15:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 I did not get from there - no - THIS screen has never worked, have always used ELO in the past
2011-09-16T18:15:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 can you give me the URL for the drivers you are finding at planar - I thought I had searched their site
2011-09-16T18:16:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	Let me just check if site is right.
2011-09-16T18:19:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	Gah, they don't have drivers for Linux for that display. :(
2011-09-16T18:19:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 I woukd add that it appears to be there in lshal too
2011-09-16T18:20:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	It seems to me that you need to configure your X. But am not good at that. Maybe someone here could help you.
2011-09-16T18:20:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 but even so - the input device is just an input device - what am I missing here - the screen looks fine
2011-09-16T18:20:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	I don't think X sees it as an input device, what does `xinput list` say?
2011-09-16T18:27:00.000Z	jpmh	MeanEYE	 have you given up on me - reason I ask is I am considering a re-boot and so will lose this session
2011-09-16T18:27:00.000Z	MeanEYE	jpmh	I didn't. I asked what `xinput list` command gives you. Is your display there?
