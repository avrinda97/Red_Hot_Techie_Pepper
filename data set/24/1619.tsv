2010-10-20T22:33:00.000Z	yonahw		I am wondering about being able to pass arguments to commands with keyboard shortcuts
2010-10-20T22:34:00.000Z	yonahw		the alt+prsc calls -w not -a
2010-10-20T22:35:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	what is it doing wrong? it should work as expected and run the command with whatever arguments you specified
2010-10-20T22:37:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	It just runs the command as if there were no arguments
2010-10-20T22:38:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	it seems to work for me, where are you setting this shortcut?
2010-10-20T22:38:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	do you mean the command or the shortcut. I created a shortcut in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts to run gnome-screenshot -a which works from the terminal correctly, however the shortcut runs seemingly without the argument
2010-10-20T22:40:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	it seems to work for me for whatever reason
2010-10-20T22:41:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	what version are you running?
2010-10-20T22:41:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	10.04 and 10.10
2010-10-20T22:42:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	and working on both?
2010-10-20T22:42:00.000Z	yonahw		any ideas as to how I could track down the source of my problem?
2010-10-20T22:42:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	perhaps it would be easier for me to ask which you're using
2010-10-20T22:43:00.000Z	quiescens		they already have, several times
2010-10-20T22:44:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	rohith sorry mentioned that earlier. I am running 10.10 here and trying to setup a keyboard shortcut to call "gnome-screenshot -a" without the quotes in the command. When I press the keys it seems to just call "gnome-screenshot"
2010-10-20T22:45:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	so it takes a screenshot of the whole screen anyway?
2010-10-20T22:45:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	precisely
2010-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	it works for me unless my 10.10 is different somehow, do you have visual effects enabled or disabled?
2010-10-20T22:49:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	not sure, how can I check. I should probably mention that when I run from terminal everything runs fine
2010-10-20T22:50:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	in system, preferences, appearance, visual effects
2010-10-20T22:51:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	was on normal, I changed to extra with no change in result? Do I have to set the command with quotes or anything in the keyboard shortcut? I tried single and double quotes both of which failed to execute entirely
2010-10-20T22:52:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	no quotes, i'm just trying to set something up with the same settings to see if i get the same issue
2010-10-20T22:53:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	thanks, I have a pretty default setup here didn't customize all that much
2010-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	quiescens	yonahw	as a workaround, you could probably make a tiny script that would run it with the correct arguments
2010-10-20T22:56:00.000Z	yonahw	quiescens	thanks that is actually a nice idea, I am going to run with that
