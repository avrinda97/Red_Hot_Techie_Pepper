2006-10-01T15:28:00.000Z	odyssevs		Any of you had experience with the broadcom43?
2006-10-01T15:29:00.000Z	odyssevs		Don't be sorry buddy. Anger is the healthiest thing in the world.
2006-10-01T15:30:00.000Z	odyssevs		Am I seriously privileged enough to be the only broadcom43 owner/operator in the room?
2006-10-01T15:30:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	I m a bcm43xx user
2006-10-01T15:31:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	I love you. What's the secret?! I've done ndiswrapper -i bcm43xx.inf with the respective sys, hooked it on to the hardware.. and I then find eth1 believing it is a wireless device.
2006-10-01T15:32:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	well I don't use ndiswrapper I use madwifi
2006-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	yes it does I have a motorola bcm43xx card
2006-10-01T15:35:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	it's just like ndiswrapper but to me it's easier
2006-10-01T15:35:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	website (madwifi.org) says it deals with the atheros chipset.
2006-10-01T15:37:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	it did when it first came out
2006-10-01T15:38:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility does not list bcm43..
2006-10-01T15:39:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	you can try http://random.blackworlds.org/bcm43xx-how-to.txt
2006-10-01T15:45:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	is there a general test which will prove whether a wifi card is functioning basically?
2006-10-01T15:46:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	yeah try pinging something anywyas my bcm43xx card works out of the box
2006-10-03T05:27:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	there is a wiki entry for building kernels
2006-10-03T06:20:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	you stll have to rebuild the kernel
2006-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	were you the one that was asking about wireless the other day?
2006-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	yes, other than printing, I think wifing is one of the only things which would put me permanently off using computers =)
2006-10-03T07:43:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	I've bought another card.. we'll see whether it works (as proclaimed with great fanfare by many how-tos etc).
2006-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	well I know what i was thinking of the other day it was wlan-ng
2006-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	wlan-ng? Similar to ndiswrapper/madawifi?
2006-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	kitche	odyssevs	yeah
2006-10-03T07:49:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	I gave up with the broadcom. I understand they're reportedly supported under the current release but the trauma was doing me in.
2006-10-07T09:58:00.000Z	odyssevs	kitche	sure.
