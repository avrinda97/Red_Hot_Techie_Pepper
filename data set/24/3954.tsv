2008-09-07T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	system
2008-09-07T10:32:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	joejoecircusboy we have to use execv
2008-09-07T10:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	Why?
2008-09-07T10:32:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	it's a uni assignment
2008-09-07T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	Ask your teacher :)
2008-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	And remember, this channel is logged and indexed by google ;)
2008-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	lol
2008-09-28T11:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	What directory are you trying to remove?
2008-09-28T11:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	It's one created by sabnzbd but it contained what i assumed is a trojan (.exe file) that i ran just to see what'd happen
2008-09-28T11:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	So no system files or anything inside
2008-09-28T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	What is the output of "ls -ld /path/to/directory" ?
2008-09-28T11:56:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2008-09-28 16:50 _FAILED_folder_name/
2008-09-28T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	That is really odd
2008-09-28T11:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	Can you remove all of the files within that directory?
2008-09-28T11:59:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	sudo rm -rf * inside the folder worked but when i ls -a again i get: .fuse_hidden0000008d00000007
2008-10-01T14:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	No, you can make it clear out all .debs with "sudo apt-get clean" or only out of date ones with "sudo apt-get autoclean"
2008-10-01T14:15:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	by 'out of date' do you mean ones with a timestamp that is older than some arbitrary value or will it only remove ones taht there are a newer version of?
2008-10-01T14:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	from "man apt-get" :  Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. The difference is that it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless.
2009-11-02T07:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	For nvidia cards, yes
2009-11-02T07:36:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	any idea if VLC uses this?
2009-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	I think it can ( as well as totem and mplayer ), I don't know if it does by default
2009-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Jordan_U	does totem use it by default? watching MKV is still using a constant 100% cpu for me. well, 50% but its dual core
2009-11-02T07:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Flynsarmy	I don't know, try checking with "gstreamer-properties"
