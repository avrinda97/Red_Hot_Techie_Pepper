2007-08-29T09:33:00.000Z	TataraKutere		sorry, i thought you answered me
2007-08-29T09:34:00.000Z	TataraKutere		 can't open the screen saver box, ubuntu crashes, what could be the problem?
2007-08-29T09:34:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	what version are you running
2007-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	feisty fawn, with gigabyte radeon 9550 256mb
2007-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	so you just run system->preferences->screensaver and your systme crashes?
2007-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	i just found a way to enable the fast write option from bios, so the desktop effects could start to work
2007-08-29T09:35:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	but it also makes ubuntu lock
2007-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	yes
2007-08-29T09:36:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	ahh, well that's a whole other ball of wax. unstalbe drivers, code, etc, cause instability :)
2007-08-29T09:37:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	so, should i reinstall them, if so how?
2007-08-29T09:37:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	if you get instability with the desktop effects, you should probably not run them
2007-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	that's okay, i will not use it
2007-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	what about the screen saver?? i have an lcd screen, i need it
2007-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	screensavers should work fine once you turn off the desktop effects
2007-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	and i also don't like prohibitions, well at least these are just screensavers, and they should work
2007-08-29T09:39:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	right, but it's the desktop special effects that are still unstable on some machines
2007-08-29T09:39:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	--the desktop effects are already off, even so, screen saver window makes ubuntu crash---
2007-08-29T09:39:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	again, desktop effects are off
2007-08-29T09:40:00.000Z	TataraKutere	taxman	could you tell me how to reinstall drivers?
2007-08-29T09:40:00.000Z	taxman	TataraKutere	ahh, well at that point, I dunno, srry
