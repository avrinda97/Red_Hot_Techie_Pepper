2011-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	omrico1		I have an EC2 server running on AWS, small instance ubuntu 10.04 TLS (lucid).
2011-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	omrico1		I installed Apache Web server, initially on port 80. When trying to remotely access the server through a web browser it went well. After that I changed the apache server port to 8040, and I opened the port in the AWS security groups.. trying to connect it also succeeded.
2011-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	omrico1		Now, after those two trials, I tried to run sort of a web service also on port 8040 (after closing the apache server of course). The web service is the web ui of the heritrix crawler. Now, when trying to connect to the service localy (i tried "telnet localhost 8040") I am able to connect to the service. Now when I try to remotely connect I am failing no matter what I do.. I try to remotely...
2011-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	omrico1		...connect from a web browser by doing: http://my.amazon.address:8040
2011-01-04T11:32:00.000Z	omrico1		I really tried almost every thing, I tried to add exceptions to the iptables, even cancel the iptables all together. I opened the ports for all IPs in the AWS dashboard.. but still nothing. And again just to emphasize, local connection go well, also remote connections to apache web server went well to the same port... What the hell am I missing?!
2011-01-04T11:34:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	Is the 8040 connection connecting directly to the heritrix crawler? or is it through apache?
2011-01-04T11:37:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	Sounds like the heritrix/jetix server is binding itself to a local address
2011-01-04T11:37:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	isn't it bind itself to a port?
2011-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	is it possible to bind yourself to an address?
2011-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	It picks a port, but many programs also allow you to pick an IP (or range) that it'll talk to.  People use it to make MySQL only talk to localhost, etc.
2011-01-04T11:39:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	I have no idea what heritrix or jetix are, so I can't help you track it down in that regard, but I
2011-01-04T11:39:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	I have no idea what heritrix or jetix are, so I can't help you track it down in that regard, but I'd look through your configuration for that and see if it's binding itself to something local
2011-01-04T11:40:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	Ok, I will try that.. by the way, jetty is another jsp server (like apache for php).. thanks for your help..
2011-01-04T11:41:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	Do you have any idea how do I check whether a running program is binded to a specifc address?
2011-01-04T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	I suggest checking the config files
2011-01-04T11:43:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	There is nothing there.. moreover, they say in their site that the whole purpose of the web interface is to allow remote access..
2011-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	I ran the netstat, this is what I get,
2011-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	maybe this is the reason
2011-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	Yeah, that's bound to localhost
2011-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	So you say I must change it within my program...
2011-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	That'd be the place to do so, yes.
2011-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	thanks, I'll see how exactly I do that...
2011-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	omrico1	I suppose if it's not in the config file already, consult the documentation for its configuration
2011-01-04T12:02:00.000Z	omrico1	Flannel	right, I will check it out... Thanks...
