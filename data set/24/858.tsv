2011-04-13T22:21:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	why do you need non-root access to /usr/local?
2011-04-13T22:23:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	well you have a partition with 300gb and one with 80gb.  Why don't you just use the 300gb for /home and the 80gb for /usr/local ?
2011-04-13T22:31:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	hi, sorry, i was afk, you said this "well you have a partition with 300gb and one with 80gb.  Why don't you just use the 300gb for /home and the 80gb for /usr/local ?" , is there a way to do it?
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	yes, do you actually have anything in /usr/local?
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	i mean, to change them, without losing data or reinstalling the OS
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	yes, OS files and stuff, but i never added nothing to /usr
2011-04-13T22:33:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	/usr/local would only have things you compiled which really shouldn't be that much if you are asking these questions to be honest
2011-04-13T22:33:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	I'll be back in 10 minutes
2011-04-13T22:33:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	ok :)
2011-04-13T22:41:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	ok back.  Can you pastebin /etc/fstab?
2011-04-13T22:48:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	sorry, i didn't meant to lie, i just didn't put anything directly in the folder, and thought there were only OS files there :)
2011-04-13T22:49:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	ah well /usr/local/ is probably empty then.  Can you check?
2011-04-13T22:50:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	here is the paste of fstab. And use/local is not empty :) I have stuff in it, and if you say that there is what i compile, then i even have a motivation for everything in there :)
2011-04-13T22:50:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	sorry, forgot to paste the link :) http://ideone.com/ssXqy
2011-04-13T22:51:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	you should reboot, choose recovery mode, transfer the data over, and then update your fstab.  Then you'll use the 300gb for /home.  Understand?
2011-04-13T22:52:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	what do you mean by "transfer the data over" ?
2011-04-13T22:52:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	do you actually mean just copy-paste? :)
2011-04-13T22:53:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	pretty much, yes
2011-04-13T22:54:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	i still don't get it...should i hopy home in /usr/local?
2011-04-13T22:55:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	in recovery mode, move the contents of /home to /usr/local.  Move the old contents of /usr/local to /home, then update your fstab and reboot
2011-04-13T22:56:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	oh, so without the actual /home, ok :) one more thing, please :) how do i update fstab?
2011-04-13T22:57:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	change "/home" to "/usr/local" and "/usr/local" to "/home"
2011-04-13T22:59:00.000Z	patrunjel	jrib	understood, thank you very much :)   (do you happen to know a nice linux book, so the next time i have problems i don't annoy somewone from the IRC channel? :) )
2011-04-13T23:00:00.000Z	jrib	patrunjel	best is to just play and figure things out (use a virtual machine to test things so you don't break your install).  But here are some good guides:
