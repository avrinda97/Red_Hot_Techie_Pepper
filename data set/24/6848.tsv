2008-06-26T01:22:00.000Z	george__		Hi, I have a laptop running Xubuntu 8.04 32bit and a desktop running Ubuntu 8.04 64bit on a LAN, how can I transfer files between them?
2008-06-26T01:23:00.000Z	joh	george__	samba is probably the simplest
2008-06-26T01:24:00.000Z	joh	george__	if you have ssh set up you can type ctrl+l in the file browser and enter ssh://<ip of other machine>/
2008-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	george__	joh	isn't there something similar to the windows network?
2008-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	joh	george__	samba, smb://<computer>
2008-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	george__	joh	<computer> is the local ip of that machine yes?
2008-06-26T01:26:00.000Z	joh	george__	Either local IP or samba hostname.
2008-06-26T01:27:00.000Z	george__	joh	is there a way to have the machine as a network icon or something, without having to go through file-browser and smb?
2008-06-26T01:27:00.000Z	joh	george__	You should be able to browse network machines with Places -> Network
2008-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	george__	joh	I tried but I was unable....
2008-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	george__	joh	do I need to set any permissions to do that?
2008-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	joh	george__	Don't think so, but as soon as you type smb://<computer> it should appear as an icon on your desktop.
2008-06-26T01:30:00.000Z	george__	joh	I did smb://local.ip and it is asking me for a password? what will that be ?
2008-06-26T01:30:00.000Z	joh	george__	Try blank password
2008-06-26T01:30:00.000Z	george__	joh	I tried the password i use to log in to that machine but it doesnt
2008-06-26T01:31:00.000Z	george__	joh	blank pw doesnt work..
2008-06-26T01:31:00.000Z	joh	george__	If the user names on the two machines are different, try smb://<username>@<ip> instead
2008-06-26T01:33:00.000Z	george__	joh	i specified the name but nothing, using or not a password
2008-06-26T01:33:00.000Z	joh	george__	samba uses its own set of passwords, try typing 'smbpasswd' on the target computer.
2008-06-26T01:35:00.000Z	george__	joh	no smbpasswd doesnt work
2008-06-26T01:35:00.000Z	joh	george__	error message?
2008-06-26T01:35:00.000Z	george__	joh	Couldn't display "smb://192.168.1.8/"
2008-06-26T01:36:00.000Z	george__	joh	Error: Failed to retrieve share list from server
2008-06-26T02:03:00.000Z	george__	joh	I installed samba, and using smb://local.ip opens up a folder which is empty, why I cannot see any other folders, the mouth point set up on the box was the user folder
