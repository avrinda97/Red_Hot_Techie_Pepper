2010-07-14T11:55:00.000Z	noisewaterphd		help. I installed ubuntu, on a seperate drive on my win7 desktop. now I can't boot back into windows to convert it to a VM to use within ubuntu. I though normally grub got installed or something, but I get presented with no options at boot, just goes straight into ubuntu
2010-07-14T11:55:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	noisewaterphd	try running this "sudo update-grub"
2010-07-14T12:03:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	noisewaterphd	what ubuntu are you using
2010-07-14T12:05:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	noisewaterphd	open a terminal, and type this 'sudo gedit /etc/default/grub/'
2010-07-14T12:09:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	noisewaterphd	what's taking you so long

2010-07-14T12:22:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	noisewaterphd	I forgot to tell you that for the changes you made in /etc/default/grub to take effect, you have to re-run 'sudo update-grub'
