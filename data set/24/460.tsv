2011-10-23T11:15:00.000Z	selite		Can anyone on this earth please help me get unlimited bandwidth from my router?
2011-10-23T11:16:00.000Z	selite		Anyone?
2011-10-23T11:17:00.000Z	selite		Stop treating me like a nood and help me
2011-10-23T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	How do you know that someone knows the answer?
2011-10-23T11:20:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	There are a lot of smart guys.
2011-10-23T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	That doesn't mean that someone knows the answer to your specific question. It might also help if you described your problem in more detail. What bandwidth are you getting now? What bandwidth do you expect?
2011-10-23T11:22:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	I have 30GB bandwidth I am paying around 40$ in other words my ISP is robbing me. I was just curious to know if there is a way to bypass their shitty bandwidth limit. Sorry for language.
2011-10-23T11:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	An apology in the same line as the offense you are apologising for is not sincere.
2011-10-23T11:24:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	Okay sorry.
2012-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	Please pastebin your complete .bashrc
2012-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	There is no need. Just tell me what should I add in the .bashrc, something that compiles though.
2012-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	There is a need, as what you've already been given is correct, which means that something else is wrong with your .bashrc.
2012-11-28T10:09:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/zhekmATQ
2012-11-28T10:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	You forgot the spaces. Copy and paste exactly what heoyea gave you.
2012-11-28T10:11:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	Again, syntax error.
2012-11-28T10:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	Please pastebin your new .bashrc .
2012-11-28T10:12:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	Copy pasted it perfectly. Ok, and thanks.
2012-11-28T10:12:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/RJqbwyYD
2012-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	You're still missing spaces. Please litteraly use copy and paste.
2012-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	Ahh, I see the problem now :)
2012-11-28T10:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	What heoyea gave you *was* incorrect, but when you repeated it, saying "I added 'nameiwant() { echo hello; }' and it didn't work." what you posted was actually correct :) If you use exactly 'nameiwant() { echo hello; }' it will work :)
2012-11-28T10:16:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	Perfect, now, help me achieve this 'rn fileName' will do this 'javac hello.java' and then 'java hello'?
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	selite	Jordan_U	Thanks a lot.
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	selite	You're welcome.
