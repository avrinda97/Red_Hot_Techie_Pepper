2007-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	DrSlony		What is the package management system in Ubuntu called, synaptic or aptitude?
2007-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	apt
2007-11-26T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	its personal preference, people liking guis seem to rate synaptic, apptidue can be used using a curses front end
2011-06-22T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	have you tested with any other gnome 3 packages
2011-06-22T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	sorry, any other gtk3 distros/packages
2011-06-22T03:02:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	have I tested any other gtk3 packages in ubuntu 11.04?
2011-06-22T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	no, tested your product against any other gtk3 rendered software, eg: fedora 15,

2011-06-22T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	that doesn't answer my question
2011-06-22T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	if you're a developer on a project, I expect much better base analysis of problems
2011-06-22T03:04:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	it doesn't answer your question, it offers more information on the subject
2011-06-22T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	yes, but I asked a question not more information
2011-06-22T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	it provides no more information that what you've already pasted in this channel
2011-06-22T03:05:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	i offered more information of my own accord before answering your question.
2011-06-22T03:05:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	assuming the theme is wrong in fedora 15, what's the issue?
2011-06-22T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	I'd look at the base differences between the desktops, the core thing is gtk3
2011-06-22T03:08:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	so you don't actually know what the problem is? "I'd look into gtk3" is quite obvious, I was hoping that people who would respond to my question would actually have experienced something similar and would be able to point me closer to the problem.
2011-06-22T03:08:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	well seeing as you've done no debugging and given me no information to work with, it's pretty hard to give you the exact problem or a possible resolution
2011-06-22T03:08:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	"no debugging"?
2011-06-22T03:09:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	the fact that if you think "it's gtk3 is quite obvious" why have you not tested it with other gtk3 rendering projects/distros to prove/disprove this
2011-06-22T03:10:00.000Z	DrSlony	ikonia	i came here to save time installing other distros, hoping to get a response from people who've had similar gtkrc issues
2011-06-22T03:11:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	don't lie - you didn't know it was a gtk issue, or you'd not be pointing out that it works in fluxbox or other such desktops
2011-06-22T03:11:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	I suggest as a developer you stop expecting people to debug your package problems and start doing the basics and giving people more information to actually helpyou
2011-06-22T03:13:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSlony	this is not gtk debugging - try #gtk or do some debugging yourself for your own software
