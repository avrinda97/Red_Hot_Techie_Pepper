2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	spunk		can someone help me with a gnome/esd problem?
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	just ask your question
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	ok:
2006-09-01T08:46:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	any ideas?
2006-09-01T08:47:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	what do you mean by "got stuck" exactly?
2006-09-01T08:50:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	did you understand my description of "the freeze"? :-)
2006-09-01T08:51:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	anything in ~/.xsession-errors
2006-09-01T08:52:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	yes,
2006-09-01T08:52:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	at occasions, it says something about esd stale socket...
2006-09-01T08:53:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	funny thing, If I start in "failsafe" every other time, I have no problem...
2006-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	how about a different user?
2006-09-01T08:54:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	have not tried that.
2006-09-01T08:57:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	If I speculate, I would say that gnome launch esd twice (at bad starts, I hear the "login theme" twice)...
2006-09-01T08:57:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	twice, in parallell that is.
2006-09-01T08:58:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	Can it be some old "session save"?
2006-09-01T08:59:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	I could try another user, but the symptoms suggest that something fails before login. When everything works, my USB mouse works fine, otherwise it is very sluggish before login.
2006-09-01T09:00:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	I'm not sure of what is going on.  Try another user would at least tell you if it is some user-specific setting or if it is something system-wide
2006-09-01T09:01:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	Ok, I'll snoop around. thanks for the help!
2006-09-01T09:01:00.000Z	jrib	spunk	gl
2006-09-01T09:02:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	tnx!
2006-09-01T09:13:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	I'm back. :-) I found a bugreport that describes my problem: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-session/+bug/43951
2006-09-01T09:14:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	Q1: should a user be part of the 'audio' group?
2006-09-01T09:15:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	Q2: The bug report suggests that the problem relates to beta versions of Dapper. I run an upgraded version of Flight 7. Should I install 6.06 fresh?
2006-09-01T09:15:00.000Z	spunk	jrib	The strange thing is that everything has worked fine until now. :-P
