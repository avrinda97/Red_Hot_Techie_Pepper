2008-10-17T03:31:00.000Z	emorris		hi, what is this restricted driver "wl" which come down on updates yesterday?
2008-10-17T03:32:00.000Z	emorris		how is**
2008-10-17T03:34:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	b43 is a reverse enginenred driver, wl is released directly from the manufacturer, wl is the best driver
2008-10-17T03:34:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	ah, ok, so should i get rid of b43 then?
2008-10-17T03:35:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	ok, they are both checked now, so I guess I'll just uncheck b43
2008-10-17T03:36:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	yeah, do so
2008-10-17T04:13:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	hi, tried disabling the b43, but it didn't work. Got a feeling "Broadcom B43" is the driver and "wl" is the firmware
2008-10-17T04:13:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	are you using a dell?
2008-10-17T04:13:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	yes
2008-10-17T04:13:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	which one?
2008-10-17T04:13:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	1505
2008-10-17T04:14:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	inspiron
2008-10-17T04:14:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	i know exaclty what the problem is, i also use an e1505
2008-10-17T04:17:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	basically, the new wl driver cant subside with the ssb, b43 driver but your modem uses the b44 driver which relies on the ssb driver. so for wl to work, you hav to blacklist b43, b44 and ssb but then you can use wired connections cos your modem deosnt have a driver.
2008-10-17T04:17:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	yes? is it anything to do with this really bad network bug in intrepid?
2008-10-17T04:18:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	no, the network bug is something else
2008-10-17T04:18:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	ssb?
2008-10-17T04:19:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	ssb module, both b43 and b44(the modem driver) rely on it
2008-10-17T04:20:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	ok, thanks. i'll probably stick with b43 for now. it works.
2008-10-17T04:21:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	yeah, i always use wireless so it was easy for me to just switch to wl and junk the b43,b44, ssb driver. when i want to use a wired connection, i just manually unload the wl driver and then load the b44 and ssb driver
2008-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	sounds a pain in the arse TBH
2008-10-17T04:23:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	i use the wired connection, once in every month, so its perfect for me to use the wl for the rest fo the time. faster speeds when i sue wl instead of b43
2008-10-17T04:28:00.000Z	emorris	Killeroid	interesting. are there any other advantages of wl over b43?
2008-10-17T04:30:00.000Z	Killeroid	emorris	signal quality is better, b43 used to output a lot of errors ito my system log, no more errors ever since i started using wl. Personall, the greatest perk is the speed. very vast difference for me.
