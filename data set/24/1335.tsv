2010-05-23T03:52:00.000Z	avi_		anyone here run Ubuntu on a Mac?
2010-05-23T03:52:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	I'm dualbooting Xubuntu and OS X on an Intel iMac
2010-05-23T03:53:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	well i'm considering doing that, but i've heard that Linux can't properly manage the CPUs, leading to decreased lifespan... have you heard about that?
2010-05-23T03:53:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	I recall reading a blog post about it but I think it's nonsense
2010-05-23T03:56:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	I don't experience any problems on my iMac, for what it's worth
2010-05-23T03:59:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	OS X is a Unix based on BSD
2010-05-23T04:01:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	The installation is not totally straightforward, but I'd give it a try if you are not satisfied with OS X
2010-05-23T04:01:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	I'm just curious, actually.
2010-05-23T04:02:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	Make backups and go dual-boot :)
2010-05-23T04:02:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	Keep an internet connection on another computer in case you run into trouble...!
2010-05-23T04:03:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	Actually, I've been triple booting for about 4 months now. Been loving it. Just wanted to put my paranoia about the CPU thing aside. Cheers for the help mate!
2010-05-23T04:04:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	is the 3rd OS Windows?
2010-05-23T04:04:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	I did OSX then bootcamp win7, then rEFIt, then Ubuntu
2010-05-23T04:04:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	just curious, did you get all the hardware running in Ubuntu?
2010-05-23T04:04:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	I have only rEFIt+Ubuntu
2010-05-23T04:06:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	I've been trying all of the versions, 8.04-10.04. All of them failed mostly except for 10.04, which was absolutely phenominal. the free graphics drivers are perfect (fgrlx (ati drivers)) are UBER messed up on ubuntu for my box, there's three launch pad posts for it because the first two got full lol. So, yeah, everything but the remote, which i'm just too lazy to fix.
2010-05-23T04:07:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	Remote was easy for me (recognised out of the box, I just had to write scripts for the key actions). What about screen brightness?
2010-05-23T04:08:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	I'm the reverse, LIRC recognizes it, but i just don't know how to configure the custom keys lol
2010-05-23T04:10:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	I have a very simple .lircrc calling irexec to control audio players and slideshows. If you are interested, I can give you a hand with that. For brightness, I had to use an ugly hack, though :)
2010-05-23T04:10:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	If you don't mind, could you perhaps point me in the right direc... excellent!!
2010-05-23T04:12:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	I'm interested. Brightness was not an issue on any of the versions from hardy>lucid. ALl I need is for it to control rhythmbox, and maybe totem.. eye of gnome (or whatever the default imageviewer would be nice tho lol). How can I install it ?
2010-05-23T04:13:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	There are plugins for at least Rhythmbox, but I prefer to just use irexec which can run any program upon a remote control key press. So make sure you have that installed and running
2010-05-23T04:14:00.000Z	avi_	schlaftier	Hold on, i'm in OSX now. can you wait 1.5 minutes for me to reboot to ubuntu?
2010-05-23T04:14:00.000Z	schlaftier	avi_	sure
