2010-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	carlos24cm		I read on the internet that the only way to remove the constraint on the keys is to use gconftool-2
2010-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	carlos24cm		but somebody knows what is the command to remove these cursed constraints draw_background and picture_filename with gconftool-2?
2010-02-05T15:09:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	hold on.  I'm checking
2010-02-05T15:11:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	go to your home folder and press ctrl + H to see hidden folders.  Rename the .gconf folder to .gconf_old, logout and login back
2010-02-05T15:11:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	you should have reset your gconf settings
2010-02-05T15:13:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	i'm trying
2010-02-05T15:17:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	did you logout of gnome and login back?
2010-02-05T15:22:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	Yes I did log out of gnome, the problem is on another pc
2010-02-05T15:22:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	thats how mozilla gives it.  You can directly run it
2010-02-05T15:23:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	can you check if you have a new .gconf and .gconf_old?
2010-02-05T15:27:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	the .gconf new is always wrong
2010-02-05T15:28:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	well, any changes you make in gconf editor is done to gconf folder.  Once you rename it, a new one should be created for you without errors
2010-02-05T15:30:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	so can you confirm that the old one called .gconf_old and a new .gconf folder is in your home directory?
2010-02-05T15:30:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	however, the changes in gconf-editor i did in OEM installatio
2010-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	the new gconf folder and the old gconf folder are in my home directory
2010-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	you made the changes in gconf from OEM install, then I'm sorry, but I dont think I'll be able to help :(
2010-02-05T15:33:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	my suggestion would be to create a new gconf on another computer and copy the entire folder there.  That might work
2010-02-05T15:35:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	don't worry, you're helping a lot, now I try to copy the gconf folder
2010-02-05T15:44:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	nothing
2010-02-05T15:45:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	even after a re-login?
2010-02-05T15:46:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	a moment
2010-02-05T15:51:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	nothing
2010-02-05T15:51:00.000Z	nigel_nb	carlos24cm	sorry then.. I'm not sure how to fix it :(
2010-02-05T15:54:00.000Z	carlos24cm	nigel_nb	don't worry and thanks of all
