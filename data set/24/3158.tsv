2008-04-17T10:44:00.000Z	witakr		Anyone here know VLC?
2008-04-17T10:44:00.000Z	witakr		well, the default contrast and brightness and gamma settings are way off and i cant get my changes to be saved when i close and restart the VLC player, you know how I can make my changes apply everytime I play a movie?
2008-04-17T10:46:00.000Z	witakr		for DVDs?
2008-04-17T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	you can edit ~/.vlc/vlcrc
2008-04-17T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	it's very well documented ;)
2008-04-17T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	yes, ~ is shorthand for your home dir
2008-04-17T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	and the period at the beginning means it's a hidden file
2008-04-17T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	could be compiz, try  alt-f2 metacity --replace and try the movie again
2008-04-17T10:53:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	ok, did that, no change
2008-04-17T10:57:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	?
2008-04-19T08:08:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	or, it's a really old card
2008-04-19T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	  lspci | grep -i vga  tells you the card, the nvidia site will tell you if the 169.09 supports it
2008-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	but my nvidia card is sitting on my desk in a padded box right now... that line you gave tells me about my onboard
2008-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	then yup, it's because it's still sitting in the padded box ;)
2008-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	when i insert the card in the PCI slot and try to boot, Ubuntu hangs up and the computer does a hardfreeze
2008-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	I'd say the card might be defective, the 6200 is a well tested card
2008-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	the card is good, I used it when i hadmy Windows XP installed
2008-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	ah, maybe the output is going to the onboard. Did you try disabling it in bios
2008-04-19T08:14:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	yes, its set to PCI
2008-04-19T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	no, except maybe booting into recovery mode with the normal card, running sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , and selecting the vesa driver and a reasonable resolution, then putting the card back in.
2008-04-19T08:19:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	whats the vesa driver, i havent heard that one before
2008-04-19T08:20:00.000Z	nickrud	witakr	it's the generic video driver, works with almost all cards
2008-04-19T08:21:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	ok so i will try that but after editing the xserver_zorg i should reboot in normal mode?
2008-04-19T10:07:00.000Z	witakr	nickrud	I tried what you said about running in recovery mode
