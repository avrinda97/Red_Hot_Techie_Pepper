2011-01-15T19:26:00.000Z	Aruzsi		Hi, Where is the Intrepid repo? I didn't find. us and hu gave me: 404 Not found. :-(
2011-01-15T19:28:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	yep
2011-01-15T19:28:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	you need to upgrade
2011-01-15T19:28:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	:-(
2011-01-15T19:29:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	Is there any other solution? I can't upgrade.
2011-01-15T19:30:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	I just wanted NAGIOS NRPE package.
2011-01-15T19:30:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	well. it's out of support, you can compile it if you want but you should upgrade it, you cannot even get security updates anymore
2011-01-15T19:30:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	so you shouldn't use that kind of server anywhere
2011-01-15T19:31:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	It is in production env.
2011-01-15T19:31:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	It is working like a charm.
2011-01-15T19:31:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	you shouldnt run old os in production, that's huge security risk
2011-01-15T19:32:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	It is an internal server.
2011-01-15T19:32:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	It isn't on the Net.
2011-01-15T19:33:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	still....
2011-01-15T19:33:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	We are using SuSE 7.3 in these day because the app not too portable on newer OSes.
2011-01-15T19:33:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	It won't.
2011-01-15T19:33:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	so your only option is either to try find out debs from somewhere or just compile it yourself
2011-01-15T19:34:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	but both ones are bad, since you are running unsupported os
2011-01-15T19:34:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	Yes, you're right but I have to use those OSes.
2011-01-15T19:35:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	well then you don't have many options
2011-01-15T19:35:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	I understand. I'm very sad. :-(
2011-01-15T19:36:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	I thought I found the last packages on the net. It is just 1 year "old" (EOL)
2011-01-15T19:36:00.000Z	gobbe	Aruzsi	yep
2011-01-15T19:36:00.000Z	Aruzsi	gobbe	Thanks for your information!
