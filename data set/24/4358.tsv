2010-03-18T01:36:00.000Z	coz_		its not just in xchat either it is also in terminal etc etc etc
2010-03-18T01:36:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	did you hit the insert key?
2010-03-18T01:36:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	mmm let me check
2010-03-18T01:36:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	cheers :)
2010-03-18T01:37:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 and Alphos   but still wide in the terminal ??/
2010-03-18T01:41:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	each application may remember the insert setting independently
2010-03-18T01:41:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 ok   Alphos  ok
2010-03-21T20:14:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 no there are not
2010-03-21T20:15:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	that's funny, since apt is just a frontend to the dpkg system, which are all .deb packages
2010-03-21T20:15:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 right
2010-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	you're not supposed to do that
2010-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 I have been doing this since ubuntu came out  and this is the only version that is causeing issues :)
2010-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	nvidia drivers have been packaged and are to be installed from the repository, not nvidia.com
2010-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	well, that's not something we support.
2010-05-03T13:52:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 I understand but  I have for the paste 6 years perferred the actual nvidia drivers  but thanks :)
2010-05-03T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	good luck :)
2010-12-28T22:37:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 well its just a flash video
2010-12-28T22:37:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	well yeah
2011-01-25T16:19:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	one doesn't 'burn' an iso to a USB key, fyi
2011-01-25T16:20:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	  I am well aware ,,, but thanks
2011-01-25T16:20:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	only mentioned it because your comment didn't seem to make sense, perhaps I was missing something
2011-01-25T16:20:00.000Z	coz_	Gnea	 it makes sense if you download the cd iso
2011-01-25T16:21:00.000Z	Gnea	coz_	not it doesn't, I put the cd iso on a usb key and it worked. it only makes sense if your target media is an actual cdr or cdrw.
