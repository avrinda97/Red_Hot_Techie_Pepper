2008-06-20T03:40:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	to report a bug i have to use the latest v ersion
2008-06-20T03:41:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	you can report the bug in Ubuntu's current version in Ubuntu's bug tracking system
2008-06-20T03:42:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	the bug is in transmission not in ubuntu :p
2008-06-20T03:42:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	also check the backports and proposed repos for updates
2008-06-20T03:42:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	doesn't matter
2008-06-20T03:43:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	if the bug is security-relevant, the Ubuntu package will be fixed (by an update, if necessary). If not, you may still get a fix through proposed or backports
2008-06-20T03:44:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	thanks for the info , i will do that in near future
2008-08-03T06:01:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	really?
2008-08-03T06:01:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	didn't knw that thanks
2008-08-03T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	it will work, but only for setting up the basic X keyboard layout -- not for resolution any more
2008-08-03T06:04:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	to the present working directory
2008-10-04T17:47:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	it's supposed to call network-admin. Try to run network-admin from terminal and see if it throws any errors
2008-10-04T17:48:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	thanks . it was not installed
2008-10-04T17:57:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	geez . now when i press unlock button in network-admin  i get an error " could not authenticate. unexpected error has occured" . i am using openbox and i don't have gnome session at all .
2008-10-04T17:58:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	I see, that's fairly non-standard... Consider editing your /etc/network/interfaces directly
2008-10-04T17:59:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	so is there any application that can help in configuring ip address and dns address like network-admin ?
2008-10-04T18:00:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	in short words an alternative to network-admin
2008-10-04T18:02:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	I don't know. I edit config files directly, or I use gnome tools. There are probably other GUI tools, but I'm not familiar with those.
2008-10-04T18:03:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	i have network-manager installed .
2008-10-04T18:04:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	you're missing other components, though, that you need in order to run network-admin
2008-10-04T18:05:00.000Z	soundray	murlidhar	is there a particular reason why you prefer OpenBox?
2008-10-04T18:06:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	yes i don't like gnome desktop
2008-10-04T18:06:00.000Z	murlidhar	soundray	and i like openbox  only
