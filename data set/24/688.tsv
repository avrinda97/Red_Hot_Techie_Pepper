2011-06-12T13:33:00.000Z	dr_willis		you login as your user Evanescence  then use sudo as needed
2011-06-12T13:34:00.000Z	dr_willis		sage: telnet [-4] [-6] [-8] [-E] [-L] [-a] [-d] [-e char] [-l user]
2011-06-12T13:34:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	I hope that I can use some comamnd line in script to login
2011-06-12T13:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 theres old school ways of doing that.. but with ssh, its easier to setup
2011-06-12T13:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 clarify what that means.
2011-06-12T13:37:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	Jordan_U_ just login, and some other function like search and check out reoult etc, all in one script. that's it
2011-06-12T13:37:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	i see
2011-06-12T13:38:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	test your command
2011-06-12T13:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 i dont have a telnet server to even connect to.. ive not used telnet in 7+ years.. ssh is the way to do that stuff these days
2011-06-12T13:39:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	yeah, but I have not installed ssh, btw, login localhost will not get attacked. right ?
2011-06-12T13:40:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	0:)
2011-06-12T13:40:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	yeah, exactlly.
2011-06-12T13:41:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	oooo. well. just login 127.0.0.1, so does it right now ?
2011-06-12T13:44:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	i see. google it again
2011-06-12T13:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 in the old says you could script telnet via use of the 'expect' scripts; but if youa re just automating telnet login.. thats a bit extreme.
2011-06-12T13:45:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	i see, ssh, then expect , right . i will
2011-06-12T13:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 with ssh, you dont need to use expect to auto-login without asking for a password. You setup ssh keys. and no need for password then
2011-06-12T13:46:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	I heared it before, public key and private key, good method.
2011-06-12T13:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 so you are basically getting a shell on a remote machine, and using the cli to controll your mldonkey stuff?
2011-06-12T13:48:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	no, I hate type too much, so I write a script to reduce my typing. that's all, I am too lazy
2011-06-12T13:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 with ssh, you can use a ssh command to tell the remote box to run a script on the box. no login, or password needed. (if you got the keys done right)
2011-06-12T13:50:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	I know this feature, because mlnet is a server, so I can just throw it a job. done.
2012-03-04T18:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Evanescence	 caliber (i think i spelt it right) can view/convert/organize them all
2012-03-04T18:48:00.000Z	Evanescence	dr_willis	thanks,
