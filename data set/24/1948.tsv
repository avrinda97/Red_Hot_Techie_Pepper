2009-06-12T15:22:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	thansk man ill check it out
2009-06-12T15:24:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	GoNt1k:but you dont get those annoying white windows with the nspluginwrapper 32 bit version so i prefer 64 bit alpha over the wrapper package
2009-06-12T15:24:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- sure, no problem (and I prefer girl) ;)
2009-06-12T15:26:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- hah.  http://www.nixiepixel.com/blog/blog7.php  :P
2009-06-12T15:31:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	nvm i was joking
2009-06-12T15:33:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- Sure, I was not entirely serious though the "self-spam" comment was mildly annoying. The videos are about Ubuntu, so I guess it is for the channel, but I could have just PM'd it...anyway, it isn't important, I'll go back to being quiet now.
2009-06-12T15:33:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	nice blog btw :)
2009-07-03T16:31:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	you promoting yourself again? :)
2009-07-03T16:31:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- Hehe, always ;)
2009-07-03T16:40:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	follow the readme if there are any uninstall instructions
2009-07-03T16:42:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	uninstall,if any, will be in the source folder you downloaded or else you need to manually remove all traces
2009-07-03T16:42:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	thats why i never compile from source :)
2009-07-03T16:44:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	ctmjr - there is a "cmake_uninstal.cmake" file in the source directory.
2009-07-03T16:45:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	thats it, readme means you should read it :D
2009-07-03T16:48:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- heh, the readme has no uninstall instructions :P
2009-07-03T16:48:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	then you are on your own, i suggest you ask the people where you downloaded it from
2009-07-03T16:48:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	but like i said, you can manually remove stuff
2009-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- had done that, no one was alive in #kdenlive
2009-07-03T16:53:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	make uninstall is not there many times
2009-07-03T16:58:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	ok so now what?
2009-07-03T16:58:00.000Z	indus	nixiepixel	next step is what
2009-07-03T16:58:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- Uhh, uninstall?
2009-07-03T16:59:00.000Z	nixiepixel	indus	- or something like clean...but I don't know, I have no experience in this area
