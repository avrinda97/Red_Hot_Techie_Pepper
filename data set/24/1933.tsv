2012-07-25T20:02:00.000Z	enriq		hi. On ubuntu 10.04 my init.d scripts are not starting (e.g. apache2, tomcat6). They do run OK with service apache2 start, but not on boot. The symlinks are correctly set on the rcx.d dirs, and rc.conf exists in upstart /etc/init dir... what else can be happening!
2012-07-25T20:03:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Are there scripts in upstart directory of /etc/init for them instead?
2012-07-25T20:09:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	nope, no upstart scripts, only sys v... but they should be running, don't they?
2012-07-25T20:11:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Yes, by way of the etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf  ..are these init.d scripts "factory" or ones you made manually or perhaps with update-rc.d ?
2012-07-25T20:13:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	If you made them manually, check they are +x
2012-07-25T20:14:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	they look factory, as per comparision with another 10.04 which works ok, and in both cases +x is NOT set for rc-sysinit.conf
2012-07-25T20:16:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	The /etc/init.d/<tomcat-or-other-sysv-script>   is what to check , not the rc-sysinit.conf
2012-07-25T20:17:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	yes, sorry, they are factory and have +x and owner root:root
2012-07-25T20:19:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	and in /etc/rc2.d I have the shortcuts
2012-07-25T20:19:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	... generated by update-rc
2012-07-25T20:27:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Is there anything in /var/log/boot.log ?
2012-07-25T20:29:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	( or logs with the names of the failed daemons in /var/log/upstart )
2012-07-25T20:29:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	in boot.log only a fsck result
2012-07-25T20:31:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	in /var/log/apache2 there are the usual apache logs with usual contents (i.e. after started with service apache2 start)
2012-07-25T20:33:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Anything informative in the apache2 log?
2012-07-25T20:36:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	normal logs in both access.log and error.log up to the shutdown (in error log it logs about SIGTERM) all this in .1 files, and then the new log starting with the manual service start
2012-07-25T20:36:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	the services are not even attempted to start I think
2012-07-25T20:38:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Very odd.
2012-07-25T20:40:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	any other log you can think of?
2012-07-25T20:41:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	in any case many thanks for your help
2012-07-25T20:43:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Offhand not anything I can think of to check. Did they work previously ? If so, what was the last thing you did before they stopped, etc ( upgrade, network tinkering, hardware replacement, etc )
2012-07-25T20:46:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	this is a somewhat "inherited" server so... I don't know really, I'm not supposed to check this stuff but I'm the one affected first when the services don't start :) I checked that all looks normal, even compared files by the byte with my local machine (exactly the same 10.04) and all looks normal... really annoying...
2012-07-25T20:46:00.000Z	enriq	genii-around	where are startup failures logged... maybe something is failing before the scripts or somehitng
2012-07-25T20:48:00.000Z	genii-around	enriq	Might want to check daemon.log if you have it
