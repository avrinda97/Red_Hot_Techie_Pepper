2011-06-14T20:06:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		anyone know how I can permanently disable "ls_switch" ??
2011-06-14T20:07:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		it's causing a big problem with the brightness in my lappy
2011-06-14T20:08:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	the brightness in your laptop is controlled by your BIOS and can be configured in ubuntu, both settings affect your laptop behavior
2011-06-14T20:08:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	it's ALSO controlled by 'ls_switch'
2011-06-14T20:08:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	and "ls_level"
2011-06-14T20:09:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	/sys/devices/platform/asus_laptop/ls_switch   << whether or not it uses the light sensor
2011-06-14T20:09:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	correct -- ubuntu, configuration settings on ubuntu and settings in your BIOS
2011-06-14T20:09:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	the sensor does NOT have a bios configuration
2011-06-14T20:09:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	trust me
2011-06-14T20:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	must be an old machine, what is the type/model ?
2011-06-14T20:10:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	my question is how to permanently disable the ls_switch (an equivalent to echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/asus_laptop/ls_switch
2011-06-14T20:11:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	it's 3 years old.
2011-06-14T20:11:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	not an 'old machine'
2011-06-14T20:12:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	it's been a long while since I had to disable anything that way, if you can't configure the brightness on your laptop using ubuntu then I would file a bug report, stuff like that is supposed to work out of the box

2011-06-14T20:13:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	i CAN configure the brightness using ubuntu, however ubuntu hasn't a builtin feature to enable/disable the LIGHT SENSOR that this model /make laptop uses, (probably because not many people have this family laptop and run ubuntu)
2011-06-14T20:14:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	This will disable your ambient light sensor if it in fact did work on your initial install of Ubuntu ->http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=973403
2011-06-14T20:16:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	  "This will enable your keyboard LCD brightness toggle switches to function on your next reboot. "  << i dont' have this problem
2011-06-14T20:18:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	i suggest you file a bug report or try asking in the room at another time, I dont have the hardware that you have, my problems with LCD on my laptop were solved by configuring settings in the BIOS and on ubuntu
2011-06-14T20:21:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		also is there any way to uninstall the nouveau kernel module without uninstalling half the system?
2011-06-14T20:21:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	have you tried  installing sysfsutils and configuring your /etc/sysfs.conf with "devices/platform/asus-laptop/ls_switch=0"
2011-06-14T20:22:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	tucemiux	i've moved on
2011-06-14T20:23:00.000Z	tucemiux	rinkukokiri	here's your answer, good luck: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=788540
