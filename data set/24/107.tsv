2012-07-13T14:01:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	very easy use unebootin to copy from ubuntu-based distributions or use Universal installer (Windows) to copy a cd image on your usb-stick than boot from the usb stick, as normal
2012-07-13T14:13:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	i got ubuntu on my system and ive downloaded the iso file to the usb drive and unpacked it to usb also but wen i boot it says error loading operating system
2012-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	ok ill try
2012-07-13T14:20:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	use any program to copy your iso-cd-image on the usb-stick, else it dosn't work!
2012-07-13T14:21:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	so its not enough to unpack it to usb drive
2012-07-13T14:25:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	no its not enough to unpack the iso files, because the usb-stick have to prepare for booting with an mbr and something. On which plattform do you work, for example Linux or Windows?
2012-07-13T14:28:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	open a terminal and type in: sudo apt-get install unetbootin
2012-07-13T14:29:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	but this tool work only for linux if you need a windows installation use another tool pls!
2012-07-13T14:30:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	 im running linux ubuntu old version and i need to get the new vwrsion of ubuntu
2012-07-13T14:32:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	installing now
2012-07-13T14:32:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	done
2012-07-13T14:34:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	okay, now start the graphical program unetbootin and select your distribution, but make sure that you have formatet your usb-stick with fat32 else it does not work!
2012-07-13T14:38:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	how do i check my version of ubuntu
2012-07-13T14:40:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	i don't understand. On unetbootin you have to select the distribution what you want to install on your stick. Select the ISO Image and the usb-stick and let unetbootin run
2012-07-13T14:43:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	i think im running the same version that the unboot is distubuting
2012-07-13T14:48:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	the version you running as host operating system is totaly uninteresting. You have to select your image in unetbootin and your usb-stick. The programm do the work for you. For example you can run unetbootin under Ubuntu and install the debian, fedora or opensuse image to your stick!
2012-07-13T14:53:00.000Z	balduin_	ps3thomas	uname -a
2012-07-13T14:59:00.000Z	ps3thomas	balduin_	sorry i just got a call
