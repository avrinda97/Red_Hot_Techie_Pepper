2005-05-12T05:49:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	you do not need a root account for SU mode
2005-05-12T05:49:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	so NOT true

2005-05-12T06:01:00.000Z	pusling	Seveas	how does it handle it_?
2005-05-12T06:02:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	no idea, it doesn't say that, i'll check the patch
2005-05-12T06:10:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	it handles disabled root accounts by simply saying (and allowing) "Press enter for maintenance" instead of "Give root password for maintenance"
2005-05-12T06:10:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	apt-get source sysvinit and read src/sulogin.c if you want to know the itti-bitty details
2005-05-12T06:11:00.000Z	pusling	Seveas	then it is new in hoary - I had the problem on a warty install
2005-05-12T06:11:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	that might very well be the case
2005-05-12T06:13:00.000Z	Seveas	pusling	that doen't really count since you actually install from the network :)
