2011-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	djcoin		Hi all, I m trying to get data from a sata disk I extracted from my older laptop that does not work anymore. Well, I try to mount it from <:de
2011-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	djcoin		from /dev/sdb but that does not work
2011-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	/dev/sdb is a disk, not a partition, you mount a partition, not a desk
2011-05-01T15:28:00.000Z	djcoin	ikonia	yeah I know, yet i dont have any /dev/sdb*
2011-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	then there is no partition on that disk
2011-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	you need to partition the disk
2011-05-01T15:29:00.000Z	djcoin	ikonia	no there are partitions, I used this disk
2011-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	you are mistaken, "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb"
2011-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	djcoin	ikonia	does not return me nothing, i tried it :(
2011-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	there are no partitions on that disk then
2011-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	there is no partition on the disk - data is already gone
2011-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	it's not mistaken
2011-05-01T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l" please

2011-05-01T15:34:00.000Z	ikonia	djcoin	don't use "sudo su"
