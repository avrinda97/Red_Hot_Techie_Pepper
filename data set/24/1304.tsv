2010-12-28T00:10:00.000Z	iksf		Friend of mine has got a HP ProLiant MicroServer for amateur server use. Trying to install Ubuntu server on it however on the partitioning only option is iSCSI, dont know where to go from here, help appreciated
2010-12-28T00:11:00.000Z	histo	iksf	is it a sata drive?
2010-12-28T00:11:00.000Z	iksf	histo	yes
2010-12-28T00:12:00.000Z	histo	iksf	then it comes up as a sda drive
2010-12-28T00:12:00.000Z	iksf	histo	we are at partition disks on the server install, no options there but iSCSI
2010-12-28T00:14:00.000Z	histo	iksf	can't you select iSCSI and parititon then?
2010-12-28T00:15:00.000Z	iksf	histo	kk press iSCSI and it asks for ip address, no idea what it is looked on hard drive no ip on there
2010-12-28T00:15:00.000Z	histo	iksf	hrm.... hit alt+f2 to switch to a busy box shell
2010-12-28T00:16:00.000Z	histo	iksf	fdisk -l
2010-12-28T00:16:00.000Z	histo	iksf	also you can use manual partitioning if the guided isn't working.
2010-12-28T00:17:00.000Z	iksf	histo	kk sec waiting for friend to type fdisk output
2010-12-28T00:17:00.000Z	iksf	histo	/dev/sdb1 || * || 1 || End 4283 || 989052 || 6|| Fat16
