2010-01-07T15:38:00.000Z	execute		?
2010-01-07T15:38:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	you should install compizconfig-settings-manager and check through the moduels to see if something is wrong with the resize module
2010-01-07T15:39:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	also : you should try to test if window reszing works by hold alt and left (or middle or right) click dragging a window works
2010-01-07T15:41:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	alt + left click drag moves windows ?
2010-01-07T15:41:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	yep
2010-01-07T15:41:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	also install fusion-icon , then run it
2010-01-07T15:42:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	isn't that used to turn compiz on and off easily ?
2010-01-07T15:43:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	its also used to do some other tricks
2010-01-07T15:43:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	currently my assumption is that the window-renderer compiz is set to needs to be reasserted.
2010-01-07T15:44:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	because you can have compiz running and it will still be providing compositing to the desktop yet the backend that controls the window frames (rendering and interaction) has crashed or gone zombie
2010-01-07T15:45:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	looking at compizconfig settings manager... it seems like "resize windows" is off. shouldn't that be on by default? oO
2010-01-07T15:45:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	yes it should be
2010-01-07T15:47:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	well, turning that on makes everything work, but... I would've expected that having it off just makes resizing less pretty, not completely disabling it :\
2010-01-07T15:47:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	fundamental module.
2010-01-07T15:48:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	also the fusion-icon applet : right click and look in the menu you should see two entries that have to do with window frames : one that selects between metacity and compiz and the other should switch between what ever window renderers you ahve (default is gnome-window-something-something-something)
2010-01-07T15:50:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	I have "select window manager" (compiz or metacity) and "select window decorator" (just one option - "GTK Window Decorator"). nothing about frames or gnome-window-something-something-something
2010-01-07T15:50:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	btw if you want that alt-right-click drag to move and resize windows on other OS's let me know
2010-01-07T15:51:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	yeah window  decorator will get populated with other options if you install for example : emerald
2010-01-07T15:52:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	should GTK Window Decorator be checked? its the only option, but its radio box is unchecked
2010-01-07T15:53:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	yep its good (using this instead of other options means it will use metacity themes (window themes you see in the appearance applet))
2010-01-07T15:54:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	of course you can try out emerald
2010-01-07T15:54:00.000Z	execute	airtonix	what's the different ?
2010-01-07T15:55:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	imo it uses a bit more resources and it then requires you to manage the window themes via a different config interface than the standard appearance manager you use for every thing elese
2010-01-07T15:56:00.000Z	airtonix	execute	personally i haven't found a theme i like that would cause me to install emerald (they are all vista/mac clones), default 9.10 metacity theme is what i've been using since intrepid
