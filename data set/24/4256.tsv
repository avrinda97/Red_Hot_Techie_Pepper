2008-05-19T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	Please use gksudo gedit    it is important
2008-05-19T21:08:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	how so?
2008-05-19T21:12:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	so the only difference is that gksudo sets HOME=/root?  Then I'd actually recommend using sudo---it works better with emacs :D
2008-05-19T21:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	THere is more of a difference than that, and sudo for gui is NEVER a good idea
2009-02-02T21:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	Please drop the colorful language.. thanks
2009-02-02T21:22:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	it's not the color but the shape that's offensive ;)  it's dropped :)
2009-02-02T21:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	Which kernel?
2009-02-02T21:26:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	2.6.28-6-generic
2009-02-02T21:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	Perhaps ubuntu +1 since that isnt our kernel
2009-02-02T21:28:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	uhh, jaunty is in my /etc/apt/sources.list, I think that might be it
2009-02-02T21:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	Perhaps ubuntu +1 is a better choince for the help you need
2009-02-02T21:29:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	ah
2009-02-02T21:30:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	so which kernel is supported for 8.10 and how do I get fglrx.ko for it?
2009-02-02T21:36:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	I installed linux-image-2.6.27-11-generic and get "Kernel source for 2.6.27-11-generic not installed.  Cannot install this module" for both fglrx and vboxdrv
2009-02-03T04:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	One user suggested this.. but I have not tried it..  Getting firefox up to speed.. in xorg.conf, in your "Module" section, adding glx/v4l/dbe/extmod/fbdevhw/record/freetype/type1/dri took care of it.  i.e: section "Module" Load "glx" Load "v4l" ..... EndSection
2009-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	ask in ubuntu+1
2009-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	how come?  I'd think the packages in ubuntu+0 would be able to tell me...
2009-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	We dont do anything with jaunty in here yet
2009-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	and adding those repos to install something is not a good idea
2009-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	okay...
2009-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	I want to know which of my packages are from there so I can downgrade them...
2009-05-28T20:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jonaskoelker	GEt a newer release
2009-05-28T20:16:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	sure.  How?  I'm working on getting cd burning working
2009-05-28T20:17:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	Jack_Sparrow	and "I" (well, my friend) has no local network, so no tftp booting...
