2012-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	rly		Is there a way to configure Ubuntu such that it doesn't ask me whether or not to restart certain services during a distribution upgrade started via the GUI?
2012-05-19T23:32:00.000Z	rly		My upgrade windows says there is about 1 day and one hour (!) remaining.
2012-05-19T23:34:00.000Z	rly		Is there some software which records my desktop and audio, but also actually works (as opposed to recordmydesktop)?
2012-05-19T23:35:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	recordmydesktop works fine for me. But you have to configure it.
2012-05-19T23:36:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	what parts are you talking about?
2012-05-19T23:37:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	I am talking about basic things like tearing, etc.
2012-05-19T23:37:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	i.e., the quality stinks.
2012-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	you have to make it record entire frames and so forth.
2012-05-19T23:38:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	by default it won't record the entire frames, so it won't work properly in 3D desktop environments like Unity.
2012-05-19T23:40:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	I would think that something that is distributed for Ubuntu (which has millions of installations) should you know... work in the default configuration.
2012-05-19T23:41:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	Ubuntu shouldn't even distribute such bad applications.
2012-05-19T23:42:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	it's not because it's a bad program, it's because it's one of those 'not officially supported, but included' programs. For such programs, you're expected to know how to use the program before downloading it, and if you don't, you can always look online for more information.
2012-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	no, if people decide to send out crap to consumers, it's their problem.
2012-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	complain to Canonical.
2012-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	we aren't consumers. We aren't buying anything. If you bought official (over the phone) support from canonical, THEN you can complain. Until then, you aren't a consumer.
2012-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	I guess that means RedHat and Microsoft both already lost. They both need support.
2012-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	and indeed they did.
2012-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	Microsoft is losing big time as we speak.
2012-05-19T23:46:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	in fact, you could go so far as to say that every OS in existence has lost. EVERY operating system needs support.
2012-05-19T23:56:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	you don't know what you're talking about, so if you aren't asking an Ubuntu related support question, you may not want to keep talking.
2012-05-19T23:56:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	uhm, yes, I do know what I am talking about.\
2012-05-19T23:57:00.000Z	rly	Tynach	who are you to say that I don't?
2012-05-20T00:07:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	that's important because..?
2012-05-20T00:34:00.000Z	Tynach	rly	Unity works as a compiz plugin. To restart it, run compiz --replace.
