2009-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	Jayce		standby..
2009-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	Jayce		rajasun - I think we got a winner
2009-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	Jayce		installing exaile as we speak, let me check add/remove programs quick
2009-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	Jayce		exaile took on a lot of libs it seems, I remember it being a light program
2009-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	Jayce		but this is also a work laptop, not my personal one, so maybe it just seemed like a lot on my own desktop (also running jaunty with KDE 4.3.2)
2009-12-10T10:36:00.000Z	Jayce		rajasun - so more or less, what did we accomplish? We just dpkg --force overwrite -i *package path* then configure -a
2009-12-10T10:36:00.000Z	Jayce		right?
2009-12-10T10:38:00.000Z	Jayce		rajasun - okay, add/remove was behaving too, so we're good now. Thanks raja, greezmunkey, and fattom.
2009-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	Jayce		is anybody running Karmic 64 bit on a laptop with the Broadcom STA driver installed?
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Jayce		anybody running WICD on their laptop? If so, any issues iwth it?
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Jayce	i have had issues in the past
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Jayce		out_cold - really?
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold		i now only use wicd on LAN
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Jayce		what kind of issues?
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Jayce		so you prefer network manager?
2009-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Out_Cold		connectivity and freezing
2009-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	Out_Cold		i prefer wicd on my server ;)
2009-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	Jayce		out_cold - so for a laptop running wifi full time you prefer the default network manager?
2009-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	Jayce	fattom	- its strange. I REALLY, REALLY like how with WICD, it'll show me each access point in the area even if it's the same SSID (handy at work)
2009-12-10T10:43:00.000Z	Jayce	fattom	- but it seems to have jumpy signal, sometiomes it drops off, then it grabs it again, it can be a PITA
2009-12-10T10:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Jayce	it's been better than the problems with wicd before. but that's with my laptop so yes
2009-12-10T10:44:00.000Z	Jayce	fattom	- At first it was happening at work, but at work we're having issues with laptops dropping connection anyway since we integrated hardware authentication through PEAP TLS into the mix. So I excused it. I came home and its doing it at home. Not as frequently, but still dropping at times. I wanst sure what to think.
2009-12-10T10:44:00.000Z	Jayce	fattom	out_cold - the only problem that really irritated me about the default network manager is I had TWO signal bars for the network I was connected to, and they each varied in signal strength and I had NO clue what was what.
2009-12-10T10:44:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Jayce	possibly to interfaces?
