2012-05-01T19:29:00.000Z	jsebean		 pyboy: Not only that how do I fix the Unity problem?
2012-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	jsebean		Hey all, I have a problem with 12.04 Gnome Classic. First, Unity is in Gnome Classic and I don't want it, problem is if I disable Unity in Gnome Classic in 12.04 then if I login as Unity it wont work. How can I keep Unity working when Logged in as Unity but not in Gnome Classic. Also, the Applications and Places link in Gnome glassic is hard to see, and the buttons on panels is white, how do i fix that?
