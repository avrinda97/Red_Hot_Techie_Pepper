2009-09-27T20:53:00.000Z	Blackbird2		"Support for HFS+ is not implemented yet" "No space left on disk"
2009-09-27T20:53:00.000Z	Blackbird2		Just...
2009-09-27T20:53:00.000Z	Blackbird2		How could I make the windows partition? Seriously. This makes no sense.
2009-09-27T20:55:00.000Z	Blackbird2		I can't partition with gparted.
2009-09-27T20:55:00.000Z	Blackbird2		It tells me that support for HFS+ is not implemented yet
2009-09-27T20:55:00.000Z	Blackbird2		I try to partition as FAT32, it goes insane a few seconds in and says something about administratyive rights.
2009-09-27T20:56:00.000Z	Blackbird2		YES.
2009-09-27T20:56:00.000Z	Blackbird2		GOD. Is it IMPOSSIBLE to do it?
2009-09-27T20:56:00.000Z	Blackbird2		And Windows with it, too.
2009-09-27T20:57:00.000Z	Blackbird2		Yes. I'm trying to resize it
2009-09-27T20:57:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	what are you trying to do exactly?
2009-09-27T20:57:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	why don't you use diskutil or whatever the app is on osx
2009-09-27T20:58:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	can you please address the person you are speaking to?
2009-09-27T20:58:00.000Z	Blackbird2	jrib	Forgive me. But yes, it's...weird.
2009-09-27T20:58:00.000Z	Blackbird2	jrib	Even hardcore mac users (Ha!) have no idea how the thing works.
2009-09-27T21:01:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	it is assuming you can create free space for it :)
2009-09-27T21:03:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	did you try using the bootcamp setup to do the resizing?
2009-09-27T21:04:00.000Z	Blackbird2	jrib	...That's...a good point.
2009-09-27T21:08:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	I have a macbook 4,1, as long as hfs+ is what os x gets installed on by default, then definitely yes you can resize it using gparted.   Note, I used sysrescuecd, not ubuntu, so I don't know if our gparted versions differ
2009-09-27T21:10:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	how are either harmful?
2009-09-27T21:11:00.000Z	Blackbird2	jrib	Mac users are basically yelling in my face, telling me that insalling Ubunbu on my MacBookPro will cause electronic tunnel damage to my CPU.
2009-09-27T21:11:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	well ask them for some proof I guess, but I've been using it for over a year on my macbook
2009-09-27T21:13:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	also, have you checked if help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook addresses your issue at all?
2009-09-27T21:18:00.000Z	jrib	Blackbird2	if in the end we can't figure it out, try sysrescuecd (that's the one I used and know for sure has support)
