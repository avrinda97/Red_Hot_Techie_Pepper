2012-10-11T08:32:00.000Z	duhamel		does anybody know of a relatively easy way of transfering files from my ubuntu machine to my Samsung galaxy s3 sd card?
2012-10-11T08:33:00.000Z	duhamel		ftp is possible but not ideal. the problem is android 4.04 uses MTP instead of USM
2012-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	duhamel		i don't have an sd card reader on my computer or i would use that?
2012-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	duhamel		what about adb? would a push command work?
2012-10-11T08:36:00.000Z	duhamel		i get that dude. i have the usb hooked up. But Samsung Gs3 uses mtp so i can't transfer without gMTP 1.3.3 which i doin't have.
2012-10-11T08:37:00.000Z	duhamel		i don't have a tablet.
2012-10-11T08:37:00.000Z	duhamel		yeah.
2012-10-11T08:38:00.000Z	duhamel		i don't want to use ftp because of data.
