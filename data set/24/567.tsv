2011-08-31T19:02:00.000Z	thunder1212		hi, does ubuntu provide full support for intel sandy bridge processor(i recently got core i3 dell vostro..), the battery back up seems to be quiet poor
2011-08-31T19:03:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	what features of the i3 does it not seem to support? I have 11.04 running on an i3 2100T
2011-08-31T19:04:00.000Z	thunder1212		the graphics is running without any visual effects (it has intel sandy bridge integrated graphics)
2011-08-31T19:04:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	it came preloaded with ubuntu 10.10
2011-08-31T19:05:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	newer versions always have expanded drivers and hardware support
2011-08-31T19:07:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	lets suppose that i upgrade to 11.04, and the graphics issue is solved which i assume will most probably be the case bcoz i tried live fedora 15 cd it was working fine.. but what about the battery back up issue..
2011-08-31T19:08:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	by 'battery back up' do you mean a UPS?

2011-08-31T19:16:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	do you mean the battery is running down faster?
2011-08-31T19:17:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	yes
2011-08-31T19:18:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	its possible the cpu frequency scaling isnt working, so the cpu is running full blast all the time. Im trying to fix the same problem on a system I have
2011-08-31T19:24:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	will this battery problem be there with windows 7 also??
2011-08-31T19:24:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	i will hate to run windows.. on my laptop
2011-08-31T19:25:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	no, Windows should already work
2011-08-31T19:25:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	with full battery
2011-08-31T19:28:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	did u check this link.. http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201104-7889
2011-08-31T19:29:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	read this:  http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-change-cpu-frequency-scaling-in-ubuntu.html
2011-08-31T19:34:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	i read that but i think the cpu frequency seems to be ok although i will check again..
2011-08-31T19:48:00.000Z	thunder1212	compdoc	does 11.04 work??
2011-08-31T19:49:00.000Z	compdoc	thunder1212	it works for me - but Im not running on a laptop
