2007-12-05T07:26:00.000Z	smooker4		Hi all
2007-12-05T07:26:00.000Z	smooker4		how do i save files to SDA6 if it doesnt have mount point.. ?
2007-12-05T07:26:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	mount it
2007-12-05T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	then it is probably mounted
2007-12-05T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	why? what happens when you try?
2007-12-05T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	type 'mount'
2007-12-05T07:29:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	in a terminal
2007-12-05T07:29:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	that's not the mount point, that's the device name
2007-12-05T07:30:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	yes, /media/sda6 is the mount point
2007-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	tell us what you did and what you are trying to do
2007-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	what filesystem?
2007-12-05T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	no, you want to save to /media/sda6
2007-12-05T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	what is the output of: ls -ld /media/sda6
2007-12-05T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	then you can write to it.  Does 'touch /media/sda6/foobar' work?
2007-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	did touch work?
2007-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	is there now a "foobar" file in sda6?
2007-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	then you can write fine
2007-12-05T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	are you writing to sda6 or a subdirectory?
2007-12-05T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	that is the full error?
2007-12-05T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	you need to copy and paste errors, not retype them
2007-12-05T07:56:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	cafuego makes a good point, does 'df -h' say sda6 is full?
2007-12-05T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	he has write permissions to sda6
2007-12-05T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	ok, ls -ld /media/sda6/downloads/'
2007-12-05T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	smooker4	what is the output of 'ls -ld /media/sda6/downloads/'
