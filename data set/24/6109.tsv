2006-01-14T16:22:00.000Z	flannel		i installed the boot loader
2006-01-14T16:22:00.000Z	lowman62	flannel	where did you install the boot loader? mbr?
2006-01-14T16:22:00.000Z	flannel	lowman62	yes

2006-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	flannel		it picked it up during install and asked me if I want to install grub loader to mbr
2006-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	lowman62	flannel	and it just bypasses any bootloader directly into windows?
2006-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	flannel		yes
2006-01-14T16:24:00.000Z	flannel		okay ... is that easy enough?
2006-01-14T16:24:00.000Z	lowman62	flannel	it could not have installed on the mbr..more likely the disk
2006-01-14T16:24:00.000Z	lowman62		drive rather
2006-01-14T16:25:00.000Z	flannel		okay... so if i google for manually installing grub bootloader
