2008-02-27T02:07:00.000Z	MrMist		Does anyone know how if I'm able to move buttons on the frame around the window? I want the min/max buttons to be on the left side of the window instead of the right
2008-02-27T02:09:00.000Z	ere4si	MrMist	you can do that in the gconf editor
2008-02-27T02:10:00.000Z	MrMist	ere4si	How do I do that with the gconf editor ?
2008-02-27T02:12:00.000Z	ere4si	MrMist	apps - metacity - general - button layout - move the menu to the end and put the colon before menu e.g. minimize,maximise,close:menu
2008-02-27T02:19:00.000Z	ere4si	MrMist	any luck?
2008-02-27T02:22:00.000Z	MrMist	ere4si	there's got to be a editor for this !? Can I create my own theme ?
