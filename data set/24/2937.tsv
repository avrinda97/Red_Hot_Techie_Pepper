2008-06-18T06:34:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	that's nothing to do with GRUB
2008-06-18T06:35:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	Some of it is, apparently--http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=258484&highlight=grub+resolution has a table which lets you choose a resolution
2008-06-18T06:36:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	and then you don't want the Desktop Manager to start, correct?
2008-06-18T06:37:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	Yes. Basically the same as Ctrl-Alt-F1, login, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop

2008-06-18T06:41:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	thanks
2008-06-18T06:42:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	that'll let you disable GDM, then you just have to add vga=[option] to the kernel
2008-06-18T06:43:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	Where do I find those VGA options for my specific resolution (1024x600)?
2008-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	not sure if there is a mode for that
2008-06-18T06:46:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	you could try 1024x768 and if not go back to 800x600
2008-06-18T06:47:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	This is a subnotebook with a ~9" screen--I don't think it can take a 1024x768 resolution
2008-06-18T06:47:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	those you can find by searching for "grub vga table"
2008-06-18T06:49:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	OK, 1024x600 doesn't seem to be supported. Anything else just looks distorted.
2008-06-18T06:49:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	I just use maximized terminal in X
2008-06-18T06:49:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	I've seen something about a vesa-framebuffer--would that do it?
2008-06-18T06:49:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	probably not
2008-06-18T06:49:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	I'd use a maximized terminal in X, but I want to maximize my battery life for an extended amount of time where I won't have access to a charger
2008-06-18T06:50:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	My battery is shot and gives me about 40 minutes battery life under GNOME
2008-06-18T06:51:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	how much time will it last without X running?
2008-06-18T06:51:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	about forty more minutes :-)
2008-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	I know how annoying odd resolutions are, I have an Asus EEE
2008-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	this thing is a fujitsu lifebook p1510d with bizarre drivers
2008-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	lockd	mib_b6hjoi	which is less than 800x600
2008-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	mib_b6hjoi	lockd	even worse than 1024x600! :-)
