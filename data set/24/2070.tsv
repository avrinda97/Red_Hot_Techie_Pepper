2009-04-25T18:42:00.000Z	Panarchy	radithz	Have you tried using the auto-text-guess feature within the Ubuntu Installer?
2009-04-25T18:43:00.000Z	Panarchy	radithz	Bootup from the Ubuntu disc. Use the first option. Double click the icon for Install. Press next until you find the keyboard layout part. Now test it out (little text box down the bottom for just this purpose)
