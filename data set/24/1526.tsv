2009-12-14T07:27:00.000Z	dem0buntu		it will see it?
2009-12-14T07:28:00.000Z	dem0buntu		ok, im downloading to see what happens
2009-12-14T07:29:00.000Z	dem0buntu		ok, because now im getting the "load kernel first" error and sometimes kernel panic :P
2009-12-14T07:30:00.000Z	dem0buntu		default kernel working like a champ, I dont know why newer ones break
2009-12-14T07:30:00.000Z	dem0buntu		nope
2009-12-14T07:31:00.000Z	dem0buntu		I do noticed than they break when some package alter the initramfs or something like that
2009-12-14T07:31:00.000Z	dem0buntu		because I always monitor the synaptic updates on console, and this last one it broke when some packaged modified that
2009-12-14T07:32:00.000Z	dem0buntu		im on grub2
2009-12-14T07:32:00.000Z	dem0buntu		uses grub.cfg
2009-12-14T07:32:00.000Z	dem0buntu		ok, going to
2009-12-14T07:32:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	the wubi failure is fun
2009-12-14T07:33:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	from what i've read, all modified files become unreadable by GRUB
2009-12-14T07:33:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	64-bit?
2009-12-14T07:35:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	i think it's caused by 64-bit
2009-12-14T07:35:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	did you pick 30GB disk size?
2009-12-14T07:35:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	i read one person who said it only happens to him on 64-bit with a 30GB disk
2009-12-14T07:37:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	i have a sticky note on my laptop right now with the 3 commands required to boot it
2009-12-14T07:37:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	modifying the GRUB menu apparantly causes it to be unable to read it due to teh ext4/beta grub issues
2009-12-14T07:38:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	and then the new kernels are unreadable too
2009-12-14T07:38:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	i don't know abuot you but when i get the backups off this HDD i'm giong pure ubuntu
2009-12-14T07:42:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	yes, well you dont' *need* swap
2009-12-14T07:42:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	but most linux users use it
2009-12-14T07:43:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	or no swap :P
2009-12-14T07:43:00.000Z	danobook	dem0buntu	so do i
