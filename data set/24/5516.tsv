2006-11-09T13:26:00.000Z	MM2		GRRR, I'm getting pissed off with dist-upgrading. I never get it working right :(
2006-11-09T13:27:00.000Z	MM2		gksu "update-manager -c" asks password for ROOT, apt-get dist-upgrade x2 won't start upgrade (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/releasenotes/610)
2006-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	gksudo, not gksu
2006-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	docs says so... look at url
2006-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	try it with gksudo.
2006-11-09T13:29:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	gksu asks for the root password, while gksudo asks you for your own password. unless you want to actually set a root password and activate the root account, gksu will never work. i really don't know why they put gksu there instead of gksudo
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	gksudo won't start update-manager :(
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	that's really strange...
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	okay, well the reason apt-get isn't doing it is because you're probably still set on the dapper repos
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	s/dapper/edgy/g
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	:wq
2006-11-09T13:31:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	sudo apt-get update
2006-11-09T13:33:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	*sigh* there is breezy on repos... Maybe I should upgrade it first :P
2006-11-09T13:34:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	oh. yeah, you can't go from breezy to dapper
2006-11-09T13:34:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	ty, sorry for troubles... I must then read how to upgrade breezy :/
2006-11-09T13:34:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	same thing, only in the sources.list, do s/breezy/dapper/g
2006-11-09T13:35:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	honestly though your system will probably be more stable if you just install edgy from scratch
2006-11-09T13:36:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	I think that too, I haven't use this comps Ubuntu much, because USB kbd and mouse won't work an breezy
2006-11-09T13:37:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	I have not testet, I'll burn install CD and install and try
2006-11-09T13:37:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	they will probably work in edgy. download the edgy cd, burn it and boot from it to see if your keyboard and mouse work
2006-11-09T13:37:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	usb kbd and mouse works, if I plug in ps/2 mouse and kbd before boot
2006-11-09T13:38:00.000Z	Vuen	MM2	i have a usb mouse and no ps/2 mouse, and it works fine in dapper and edgy. i'm using it right now.
2006-11-09T13:38:00.000Z	MM2	Vuen	This is HP computer :P
