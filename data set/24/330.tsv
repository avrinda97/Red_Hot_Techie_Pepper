2011-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	TK5791		I'm currently running this OS on a Dell XPS
2011-11-24T01:48:00.000Z	TK5791		The machine has an HTML out.... does anyone know how to activate it when using a HD monitor?
2011-11-24T01:49:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	HDMI...
2011-11-24T20:08:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	d) Use another desktop environment, such as XFCE.
2011-11-24T20:08:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	apt-get install the-name-of-the-one-you-choose
2011-11-24T20:09:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	Try: sudo apt-get install xfce4
2011-11-24T20:09:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	thamlks
2011-11-24T20:12:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	k, good luck
2011-11-24T20:13:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	No need for that, lol, log out, hit the little gear thingo, select "XFCE" and log back in
2011-11-24T20:18:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	You can't really disable it, but you can set it to have no password
2011-11-24T20:18:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	sounds promising
2011-11-24T20:18:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	Just use seahorse
2011-11-24T20:19:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	No, it won't appear, and yes, seahorse.
2011-11-24T20:19:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	It's an app that comes preinstalled
2011-11-24T20:21:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	I simply deleted it... would that be right?
2011-11-24T20:22:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	Deleted what?
2011-11-24T20:22:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	in seahorses, it has one login keyring... it wouldn't let me modify it, only delete it
2011-11-24T20:23:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	I see, hm, not even change the password?
2011-11-24T20:23:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	not even change it... will deleting cause a problem
2011-11-24T20:23:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	Nah, it will get recreated but you'll lose all saved passwords from gnome apps
2011-11-24T20:24:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	it will get reactivated... so deleting it hasn't changed a thing?
2011-11-24T20:24:00.000Z	theadmin	TK5791	Well... it should have
2011-11-24T20:26:00.000Z	TK5791	theadmin	so far so good
