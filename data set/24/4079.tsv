2008-06-12T11:12:00.000Z	sauvin		My hardy heron's KDE is hosed. windows cannot be moved or resized, and they have no minimise/maximise/cancel buttons.
2008-06-12T11:12:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	I'm psychic. You're using window compositing ("desktop effects")
2008-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	yes. I'm trying to disable them, in fact. How to kill?
2008-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	You also have an nvidia graphics card
2008-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	yes.
2008-06-12T11:14:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	do you know how to kill the desktop effects?
2008-06-12T11:15:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	do you want to kill them or fix the problem?
2008-06-12T11:16:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	my psychic powers tell me that this is missing from your Section "Device" in your xorg.conf: Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
2008-06-12T11:16:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	let me test your psychic ability :D
2008-06-12T11:18:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	you're batting a thousand.
2008-06-12T11:20:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	you're not very adventurous!
2008-06-12T11:21:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	I don't understand, though. Everything was working beautifully when I shut down last night.
2008-06-12T11:22:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	that's because compositing and nvidia have a magical robo-sexual relationship, the likes of which... oh never mind, he left
2008-06-12T11:23:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	no joy. Windows still cannot be moved, resized, maximised, minimised or canceled.
2008-06-12T11:24:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	kde4 or 3.5-ish?
2008-06-12T11:28:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	what happens when you sudo killall kwin && kwin?
2008-06-12T11:30:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	that would be a problem, yes -.-
2008-06-12T11:32:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	if you get time, post your saga to the ubuntu forums as [SOLVED], to help future generation of kwin-less lads.
2008-06-12T11:32:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	thanks a bundle. That was really frustrating, and yes, I believe I'll do precisely that.
2008-06-12T11:33:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	np. enjoy your fancy windows-resizing
2008-06-12T11:34:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	ask Windows versions 1 to 3.11
2008-06-12T11:36:00.000Z	RAdams	sauvin	windows as it was originally demo'd did not have resizable windows for most things. those that could resize weren't able to overlap anything else
2008-06-12T11:37:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	that wasn't true in 3.0 on upwards. I can't speak for Windows < 3.0.
2008-06-12T11:50:00.000Z	sauvin	RAdams	went away/
