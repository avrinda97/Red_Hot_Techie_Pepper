2008-07-15T12:16:00.000Z	Xavura		I am doing something which I have no idea how to do
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	Xavura		I am being told to modify linux kernel
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	Xavura		I am being to told to compile things
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	whats that
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	woah take some xanex and try again later =\
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	now,  with plain english and less swearing,  whats the problem,  in detail
2008-07-15T12:17:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	yes,  yes we do ;)
2008-07-15T12:18:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	well some of us do I'm sure
2008-07-15T12:19:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	try following the standard journalism ideology when you request help,  who, what when where and why... the 5ws...
2008-07-15T12:19:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	I am following these instructions - http://nikosapi.org/wiki/index.php/WIS_Go7007_Linux_driver - I followed the instructions for Ubuntu Hardy but then I got to a part AFTER saying it doesn't work and you need to do a bunch of other things before compiling to make it work, otherwise do something to the Linux kernel
2008-07-15T12:20:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	the problem is it added/edited a LOT Of files and it comes with no uninstall script
2008-07-15T12:20:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	well that's one of the problems
2008-07-15T12:20:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	heh.. (always make back ups.. `cp fileyourgonnaedit fileyourgonnaedit.bak`
2008-07-15T12:21:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	err I didn't edit any files
2008-07-15T12:22:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	ok so what have you completed in regards to this
2008-07-15T12:23:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	well I have ran sudo make install, now it's saying I need to edit files before I compile so WTF? Why didn't it say that before the instructions, now I have NO WAY to undo what I have just done so that I can make the neccessary edits
2008-07-15T12:23:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	sure there is
2008-07-15T12:23:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	go into the directory ,   (if you don't wanna have to keep typing sudo,  try sudo -i to become root)
2008-07-15T12:23:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	type make clean
2008-07-15T12:24:00.000Z	Xavura	robf_	Do you want to see the output of the **** console? It EDITED the kernel files and ADDED loads, I'm pretty sure
2008-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	I don't think you've made any unchangeable changes
2008-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	it's not permenant
2008-07-15T12:26:00.000Z	robf_	Xavura	I already pmd you heh due to that reason =s
