2007-12-12T01:12:00.000Z	jubilee		Hey, does anyone know how to stop all of the scrolling madness in 7.10???
2007-12-12T01:13:00.000Z	jubilee		All of the... scrolling madness... Ubuntu 7.10... madness
2007-12-12T01:13:00.000Z	jubilee		How to stop it
2007-12-12T01:14:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	what exactly do you mean?
2007-12-12T01:15:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	when I'm in FF and I scroll up/down to top/bottom of page it takes me to previous/after pages... when I'm on Ubuntu desktop and I scroll it sends me to a different workspace
2007-12-12T01:16:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	I can't seem to find how to stop this from happening. I use a trackpad... so it does it accidentally all the time.
2007-12-12T01:16:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	so it seems the up/down is working as side/side
2007-12-12T01:17:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	well, it does up and down, but when I reach the top of the page it sends me back... when I reach the bottom, if there is a forward, it sends me forward, but it does this in Ubuntu too, not just FF
2007-12-12T01:18:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	what model laptop do you have.. is it a synaptic touchpad?
2007-12-12T01:18:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	actually yeah, I think so. It's a Dell Inpsiron E1505
2007-12-12T01:20:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	try installing gsynaptics: sudo apt-get install gsynaptics
2007-12-12T01:20:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	alright, I'll try that. brb (thx)
2007-12-12T01:22:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	now do I have to restart or anything, or should it be in effect?
2007-12-12T01:22:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	might have to restart x... check and see if anything is different
2007-12-12T01:24:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	ok I'm going to restart. I'll be back to tell you if it worked.
2007-12-12T01:27:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	yeah... still does it... not in FF though, so that's good...
2007-12-12T01:28:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	i sent you a memo
2007-12-12T01:28:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	how do I get it?
2007-12-12T01:28:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	/msg memoserv read all
2007-12-12T01:30:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	tells me i need a password... dont have one
2007-12-12T01:39:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	something's wrong... When I enter "cd xserver-xorg-input-synaptics*" it tells me "No such file or directory"
2007-12-12T01:40:00.000Z	jubilee	profanephobia	should those dashes be slashes?
2007-12-12T01:41:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	just do locate synaptic.c then continue from there
2007-12-12T01:43:00.000Z	profanephobia	jubilee	try using find instead of locate sry
