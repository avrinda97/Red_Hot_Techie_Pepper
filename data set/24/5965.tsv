2007-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	which is the partition Vista is on ?
2007-05-23T05:42:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	you need to manually add a GRUB entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst that will access the Vista partition and make the boot from there
2007-05-23T05:43:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	cheers... uumm..... how do i do that?
2007-05-23T05:43:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	do a "sudo fdisk -l" and paste its contents on pastebin
2007-05-23T05:44:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-05-23T05:45:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	that'll help you get write access to your partition, but didn't you say you want to boot into it ?
2007-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	there's a slight understanding problem here: stormx is trying to help with write access to the ntfs partition, i'm trying to help with booting into vista again. now WHAT do you want to be helped with ? so that we don't talk together, with the obvious result of your head exploding into tiny little pieces
2007-05-23T05:49:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	lol, ok, i want to be able to boot into vista
2007-05-23T05:50:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22133/
2007-05-23T05:54:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	do i need to be logged in as root to edit it?
2007-05-23T05:54:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	you can use a text editor like nano, by typing "sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2007-05-23T05:54:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	that will launch nano as root
2007-05-23T05:58:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	ok, done that, gonna reboot now
2007-05-23T06:40:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	thanx re: accessing Vista, it worked!!!
2007-05-23T06:44:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	glad vista worked
2007-05-23T06:44:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	do you mean an NTFS partition ?
2007-05-23T06:45:00.000Z	Xeonwales	nuu	lol, yes, sorry

2007-05-23T06:47:00.000Z	nuu	Xeonwales	as root, edit /etc/apt/sources.list, remove the # before the "universe" repos, save the file, and do a sudo apt-get update. when that's done, retry installing ntfs-config
