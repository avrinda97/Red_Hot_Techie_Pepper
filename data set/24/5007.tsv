2010-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	darko3d		im looking into compiling notepad++ on linux, the official site says the project is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API, does the Win32 API mean a definite no on compiling it on a *nix version
2010-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	I think you can Wine it
2010-06-29T01:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	,but there are good alternative apps :)
2010-06-29T01:44:00.000Z	darko3d	sebsebseb	yeah i got it to work in WINE, there's some loss of functionality, and i used all of those other editors, nothing gave me the same experience as notepad+
2010-06-29T01:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	maybe you want a graphical version of Emacs or something, that can do a lot
2010-06-29T01:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	for for programming though I guess
2010-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	try Kompozer
2010-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	yes and no
2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	depends on what you want to do, and you can Wine stuff like Dreamweaver
2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	you can also run Windows in a virtual machine, as long as you got enough RAM and such
2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	fine for nearly everything, not 3D games though
2010-06-29T01:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	and of  course you could also dual boot with Windows
2010-06-29T01:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	also yes it takes time, but I would prefer to hand code a site :)  however for more complex sites that would take ages, so not for those
2010-06-29T01:56:00.000Z	darko3d	sebsebseb	yeah but what the point, i moved to ubuntu to move away from windows
2010-06-29T01:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	right, but if you virtual machine WIndows inside, Ubuntu you actsaully get a  kind of security advantage over a pshyical install
2010-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	since you can just easilly  delete a vm that gets virus infected for example, and use a clean copy or snapshot.  Yes distros such as Ubuntu and Mandriva, but not so much now.  Try to replace Windows on the desktop.  However  really the point of Desktop Linux was never to do that, it was to offer software freedom.
2010-06-29T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	and since lack of commercial software and hardware manufacture support,  when it comes to certain stuff,  people are still going to need Windows sometimes.
2010-06-29T02:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	however there is ReactOS in development, which will be basicaly an open source version of Windows that has been done better when its ready.  Development is very slow, and its rather alpha at the moment. http://www.reactos.org
2010-06-29T02:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	have a look at the bug1  link, but also the Linux is not Windows link.  If you can understand all of what I am saying now, well :)  and most Ubuntu users dual boot with Windows at the moment
2010-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	so what Windows apps do you want anyway, Notepad++ anything else?
2010-06-29T02:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	if you program, there are loads of  opensource projects you can contribute to, and oh  a lot of these projects would really benefit with a more more developers.
2010-06-29T02:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	a few more, above
2010-06-29T02:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	darko3d	dual boot or virtual machine Windows,  or use alternative apps in Ubuntu, or in Wine,  or program your own, and problem solved :)
