2006-08-29T14:34:00.000Z	billyp	richiefrich	I ran make in a term, got lots of errors & then worked out which dev files I needed until compile ran. Think that was it..
2006-08-29T14:35:00.000Z	billyp	richiefrich	didn't use the && at all
2006-08-29T14:35:00.000Z	richiefrich	billyp	did u run .. make install
2006-08-29T14:35:00.000Z	billyp	richiefrich	no
2006-08-29T14:35:00.000Z	richiefrich	billyp	then u just compiled it
2006-08-29T14:37:00.000Z	billyp	richiefrich	 I have a folder with an executable & that tuns OK. Its geginning to look like I didn't install, isn't it?
2006-08-29T14:38:00.000Z	richiefrich	billyp	well if you  did   -- > ./configue   and  make  and n ot  make install then u never installed it
2006-08-29T14:39:00.000Z	billyp	richiefrich	ubuntu: I see!!  I thought because I had a binray that ran, I'd finished...Should be OK now. many thanks guys, I thought
