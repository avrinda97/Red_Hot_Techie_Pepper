2006-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	danjah		hi, anyone know how to get to telinit 3 - with no X, etc... ( I have tried Ctrl+Alt+F2 / telinit 3 ) but this does not work for me!
2006-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	wildman	danjah	you mean not booting in GUI by default?
2006-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	danjah		YES wildman
2006-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	wildman	danjah	if so, change /etc/inittab to initdefault 3
2006-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	danjah		not by default, just a one off, sorry
2006-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	wildman	danjah	euh...

2006-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	wildman	danjah	Ctrl+Alt+Fn, where 1 < n < 6, then init 3 ?
