2010-01-11T12:13:00.000Z	Tamnakz		morphynor I'm not hacking anything. . . three people have already given me permission to use their networks. . . I'm simply trying to find a program that'll give me decently accurate signal strengths so that I can decide which to try for. . . something similar to netstumbler I used with windows
2010-01-11T12:14:00.000Z	Tamnakz		iwlist scan?
2010-01-11T12:14:00.000Z	Tamnakz		where? how?
2010-01-11T12:15:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	in terminal
2010-01-11T12:15:00.000Z	Tamnakz		interface doesn't support scanning. . .
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	you most likely dont have your wireless modules installed
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	Tamnakz		wlan shows scan completed, sweet, this'll work!
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	try: ifconfig wlan0 up
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	arghh2d2		ok, cool
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	arghh2d2		n/m
2010-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	Tamnakz		I'm on wireless now
2010-01-11T12:17:00.000Z	arghh2d2		just be careful with iwlist scan... the fcc might come knockin on your door if you use it too much
2010-01-11T12:17:00.000Z	Tamnakz		if I use it too much? there's nothin' they can do. . .
2010-01-11T12:18:00.000Z	Tamnakz		signal level and noise level, measured in dBm. . . how can I convert that into a logical memasure? or is there a scale to it?
2010-01-11T12:18:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	DoD watchlist
2010-01-11T12:18:00.000Z	Tamnakz		so? I'm using it to get access to networks I've been permissed to use
2010-01-11T12:18:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	you dont know the full potential of the software your using
2010-01-11T12:19:00.000Z	arghh2d2		ive said too much already
2010-01-11T12:19:00.000Z	Tamnakz		it tells me the encryption key is set to off. . . when there is a key will it show me something different?
2010-01-11T12:19:00.000Z	Tamnakz		other than the fact that there is one?
2010-01-11T12:20:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	yeah... "on"
2010-01-11T12:21:00.000Z	Tamnakz		is there a simple way to make sense of the dBm measurements?
2010-01-11T12:22:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Tamnakz	it usually breaks down to a channel, 1 thru 11 i believe
2010-01-11T12:23:00.000Z	Tamnakz	arghh2d2	what do you mean about breaking down channels?
