2007-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG		Just typical... I botched the network connection to my fathers Ubuntu Feisty... and hes 220 km's away... can anyone here help me troubleshoot... I have him on the phone, and Ive reached the end of my linux-capabilities...
2007-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG		opening network settings shows that the cable connection is selected...
2007-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	what did you do?
2007-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	well... the weird thing is that I was trying to set up his nvidia card using a remote desktop... didnt really do anything to his network settings...
2007-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	ping www.yahoo.com
2007-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	but he cant reach the internet at all!
2007-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	so you say
2007-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	hold on! :)
2007-09-15T06:22:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	well, hes behind a router and he cant eveng access that...
2007-09-15T06:23:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	can he ping the router?
2007-09-15T06:24:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	well try!
2007-09-15T06:27:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	well... got everything working by starting the older kernel in the GRUB!
2007-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	nice
2007-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	but the newest kernel worked before I messed things up...
2007-09-15T06:28:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	can I reset the setting of the newer kernel?
2007-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	v odd that a kernel stops networking, not sure what's wrong there
2007-09-15T06:29:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	should I reinstall the nonkernel from synaptics?
2007-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	why not stick with the kernel that works?
2007-09-15T06:30:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	then you can fiddle when you have local access
2007-09-15T06:31:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	well... perhaps youre right... I could set up GRUB to choose the older kernel by default...
2007-09-15T06:31:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	best
2007-09-15T06:32:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	could I at a later point reinstall hes computer with the ubuntu live CD in a way that keeps all users and mail setting and so on?
2007-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	frogz	UbuntuN00B_HBG	only when /home is on a separate partition, otherwise you'll have to back it up
2007-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HBG	frogz	oki!
