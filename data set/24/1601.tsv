2009-11-03T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	you could convert the pdf to text, or use pdfedit to edit the file
2009-11-03T16:27:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	used both but none allows me to embed ocr
2009-11-03T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	can you expand on embed ocr? do yu mean add some scanned text to an existing pdf?
2009-11-03T16:29:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	with adobe acrobat i can embed the ocr into the pdf image instead of having it as a seperate file
2009-11-03T16:29:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	tesseract and the like ccreate a seperate text file
2009-11-03T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	so you scan some text using OCR then add it to an existing PDF text to make it bigger, "embed ocr" doesnt make sense
2009-11-03T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	you can embed the text which is the result of a scan using ocr
2009-11-03T16:30:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	adobe acrobat has a built in ocr feature which will ocr an image and embed the ocr in the document and keep it alighned with the image
2009-11-03T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	i'd have thought pdfedit would have been great here
2009-11-03T16:31:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	meaning, if i find text that i ocred it will tell me where exactly in the image it is
2009-11-03T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	scan the new image / text then add it in
2009-11-03T16:31:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	pdfedit has no ocr , or does it?
2009-11-03T16:32:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	very manual process
2009-11-03T16:32:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	unless im missing something
2009-11-03T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	you can scan from something like gimp and then use the result to add to pdfedit
2009-11-03T16:32:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	but the problem is I would like to ocr a document and have the result embedded into the document
2009-11-03T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	you can you just need to use more than one application
2009-11-03T16:33:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	perhaps not as nicely as adobe but at least within the same page
2009-11-03T16:34:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	will pdfedit automatically allow me to embed text... incidently the text would not be visible over the image that is why adobe embeds it
2009-11-03T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pigphish1	all i can recommend is scan with an app then past the stuff into pdfedit
2009-11-03T16:35:00.000Z	pigphish1	ActionParsnip	thanks
