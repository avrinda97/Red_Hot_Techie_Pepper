2005-01-14T14:09:00.000Z	mifune		hello. how do i instal a soundblaster 16 card?
2005-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	is it a PnP sb16 or a non-PnP sb16 (very important difference)?
2005-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	do you have the card physically in front of you (outside the box)?
2005-01-14T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	lsmod|grep ^sb
2005-01-14T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	use #flood
2005-01-14T14:18:00.000Z	mifune	crimsun	i know i have a 16 or 32 bit awe compatible driver installed in windoze
2005-01-14T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	is it a genuine sb16 or a clone?
2005-01-14T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	it'd be easier if you physically inspected the card
2005-01-14T14:55:00.000Z	mifune	crimsun	its a creative labs soundblaster 16 pnp
2005-01-14T14:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	lsmod|grep ^sb
2005-01-14T15:00:00.000Z	mifune	crimsun	that command had no visuable effect
2005-01-14T15:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	good
2005-01-14T15:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	sudo modprobe snd-sb16 index=0 isapnp=1
2005-01-14T15:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	what did that command return?
2005-01-14T15:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	you're positive it's "PnP"?
2005-01-14T15:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	sudo modprobe snd-sb16 index=0 isapnp=0
2005-01-14T15:05:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	and the result?
2005-01-14T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	just returns you to prompt?
2005-01-14T15:07:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	please paste in #flood the output of `cat /proc/asound/cards'
2005-01-14T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	so it wasn't PnP after all
2005-01-14T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	echo snd-sb16 | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2005-01-14T15:09:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	then: echo "options snd-sb16 index=0 isapnp=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/snd-sb16
2005-01-14T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	now you can use Applications>Sound & Video>Volume Control to unmute and adjust the volume
2005-01-14T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun	mifune	and when you reboot, your sound card will be used.
