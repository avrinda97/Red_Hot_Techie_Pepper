2010-09-22T02:37:00.000Z	kantxx		anyone know why i cant ssh into my own ubuntu server remotely? ssh user@localhost works and ssh@hostname asks for password but fails..
2010-09-22T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	are you specifying the correct username?
2010-09-22T02:38:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	yes
2010-09-22T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	you install anything like denyhosts or fail2ban?  You checked /etc/hosts.deny?
2010-09-22T02:39:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	no.. fresh install
2010-09-22T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	and ssh localhost asks for a password?
2010-09-22T02:39:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	and works
2010-09-22T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	try with ssh -vvv, also check logs on the server
2010-09-22T02:41:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	by the way, when you say "fails", what do you mean?  Does it ask you again for a password?
2010-09-22T02:41:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	yeah it keeps askingfor pass when doing it remotely
2010-09-22T02:43:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	did you try what I said?
2010-09-22T02:43:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	seems fine he output
2010-09-22T02:43:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	pastebin
2010-09-22T02:47:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	i dont understand.. i stop sshd and it starts itself..
2010-09-22T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	are you sure? If you have a running ssh session, it will stay alive
2010-09-22T02:49:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	/etc/init.d/ssh stop and i see the PID changing
2010-09-22T02:51:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	wtf.. in order to acctually keep sshd stopped i have to kill it in a loop
2010-09-22T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	that isn't my experience
2010-09-22T02:51:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	wth is going on
2010-09-22T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	did you make sure you closed any existing ssh sessions you had?
2010-09-22T02:51:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	yes
2010-09-22T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	you know your sshd is still running?
2010-09-22T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	kantxx	or at least the one on the computer you're talking to me with
2010-09-22T02:52:00.000Z	kantxx	jrib	if i do a while [ true ] do killall sshd done         it gets connection refused.. which means no IP/DNS issue.. but doing /etc/init.d/ssh stop doesnt acctually STOP it
