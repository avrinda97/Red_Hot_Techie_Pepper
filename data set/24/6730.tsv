2005-08-03T15:39:00.000Z	lasindi		Hello, I'm having trouble dual-booting Windows and Kubuntu (I had the same issue with Ubuntu). I installed it, and now when I try to boot Windows, a blue screen pops up for half a second and then the computer restarts.
2005-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	lasindi		Does anyone know what's going on?
2005-08-03T15:40:00.000Z	lasindi		So, I need to reinstall Windows now?
2005-08-03T15:42:00.000Z	lasindi		I'm not quite following ...
2005-08-03T15:44:00.000Z	lasindi		So what did I do wrong when I installed Ubuntu?
2005-08-03T15:45:00.000Z	lasindi		It was working perfectly before.
2005-08-03T15:45:00.000Z	lasindi		Wouldn't this have something to do with the boot loader?
2005-08-03T15:46:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	lasindi	how do you install it?
2005-08-03T15:46:00.000Z	lasindi	PrimoTurbo	I had Windows installed on a partition that left about 10 GB of free space on the hard drive.
2005-08-03T15:48:00.000Z	lasindi	PrimoTurbo	a blue screen just flashes up and then disappears as it restarts.

2005-08-03T15:56:00.000Z	lasindi	PrimoTurbo	no the same thing happens.

2005-08-04T16:06:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	lasindi	Sorry, I don't know what else I can say
2005-08-04T16:06:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	lasindi	You will need to stick with linux or reformat and get windows if you want it again
