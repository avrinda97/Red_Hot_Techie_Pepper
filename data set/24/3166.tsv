2008-12-12T04:32:00.000Z	russK		anyone know how make installer put grub onto raid1 partition?
2008-12-12T04:33:00.000Z	russK		i want /boot partition on raid1
2008-12-12T04:35:00.000Z	russK		can /boot partition be on RAID1 device?
2008-12-12T04:36:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	is raid1 mirror or stripe? i forget
2008-12-12T04:36:00.000Z	russK		raid1 is mirror (i believe - that's my intent)
2008-12-12T04:36:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	in theory, you can boot off mirror, because it just sees one instance of the drive, and uses that.
2008-12-12T04:37:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i attempted to setup that with my current system. 100mb partitions on each drive, mirrored, and then the remaining in a raid5 array.
2008-12-12T04:37:00.000Z	russK		ï»¿un_dave: thanks, i think it's possible but i don't see how to convince installer to see the device
2008-12-12T04:38:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i think i managed to get it to boot from the mirror, but never managed to get it to mount the rest of the raid 5, to start the rest of the system.
2008-12-12T04:38:00.000Z	russK	un_dave	 also, grub docs don't say much about it
2008-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	yeah. on topics like that, i found the documentation very very sparse
2008-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	russK	un_dave	 did you use ubuntu installer?  I had this working with gentoo - they have a good guide
2008-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i was assured it could be done, but no one was sure how
2008-12-12T04:40:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	hang on and i'll find my ubuntu post about it.
2008-12-12T04:40:00.000Z	russK	un_dave	the gentoo guide for software raid with lvm2 is nice, but i can't convince ubuntu installer to do the same
2008-12-12T04:41:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i think i used that gentoo guide as well, but here's my forum links anyway

2008-12-12T04:42:00.000Z	russK		thanks un_dave
2008-12-12T04:43:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i never did get it to work the way i wanted. :( ended up with an unraided system drive, and raid 5 for my home directory.
2008-12-12T04:43:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	i'd be curious to know what you think about the way i did it.
2008-12-12T04:45:00.000Z	russK		ok, un_dave, but i'm not real experienced with raid ... i'm just kindof experimenting ... first time with LVM too which i really like
2008-12-12T04:48:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	well that was my first attempt at it, and it was about a year ago. i actually revisited the whole topic over the last week, because i added another 1tb drive into the raid5 array, and had to grow it.
2008-12-12T04:48:00.000Z	un_dave	russK	that was interesting :S
