2005-06-01T11:24:00.000Z	reisio		Nvu
2005-06-01T11:24:00.000Z	reisio		if you don't like Nvu, then actually LEARN HTML, CSS, etc and get a good text editor
2005-06-01T11:25:00.000Z	reisio		Nvu is based off Mozilla composer and will basically be replacing it
2005-06-01T11:25:00.000Z	reisio		Bluefish is quite decent
2005-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	reisio		bluefish is better when you turn off all the default panels :p
2005-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	have u tried screem?
2005-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	nope
2005-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	i use screem. u might want to try it.
2005-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	what about quanta?
2005-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	looking at screem - looks like a lot more GUI than I need
2005-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	I only really care for GUI so it matches my other windows, has nice tabs and possibly a document selector/tree
2005-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	ok. i understand - it willl probly be overkill for ya then
2005-06-01T11:29:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	ya, but good to know - one more thing to recommend people
2005-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	will try it anyways - I assume I'll be able to disable/not use what I don't care for
2005-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	what about quanta? nice support for webdav etc
2005-06-01T11:31:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	i still ended up using bluefish after everything :)
2005-06-01T11:32:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	sounds like overkill, too
2005-06-01T11:32:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	it's Qt?
2005-06-01T11:32:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	really anything that calls itself and "environment" I tend to veer away from
2005-06-01T11:32:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	haha ok
2005-06-01T11:33:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	im still in month 2 of having been ubuntuised so im going thru the throes of package sampling overdrive
2005-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	ubuntuised from what?
2005-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	killapop	reisio	windows
2005-06-01T11:34:00.000Z	reisio	killapop	cool
