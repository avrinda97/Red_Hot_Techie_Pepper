2007-06-01T10:53:00.000Z	mkquist		anyone aware of problems withe the nvidia driver?  Installed ubuntu like a month ago and beryl worked great easily, now whenever is goto install nvidia driver i get stuck at 800x600?
2007-06-01T10:54:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	tried "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to set your res?
2007-06-01T10:54:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	- yep, didnt do anything, just reinstalled , again! (3rd time, faster than fixing)
2007-06-01T10:56:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	huh, tried adding the resolutions manually editing the xorg.conf file?
2007-06-01T10:58:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	try the reconfigure command again, and only choose the highest resolution you want. You might also want to check the xorg.conf file in the Device section to see if the Driver is "nvidia" not "nv" or "vesa"
2007-06-01T11:00:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	u know it works fine until i install the nvidia drivers...
2007-06-01T11:00:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	do the drivers say anything weird? or just plain install without errors?
2007-06-01T11:01:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	no Beryl but.. it works, nope just plain install no probs, what strange is this was all working fine and easy before
2007-06-01T11:01:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	what version did you had before, and what's your card?
2007-06-01T11:02:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	getting tired of reinstalling it all, i mean its quick but id like to just get it running again.. =(
2007-06-01T11:02:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	fawn, 6800gt
2007-06-01T11:02:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	try installing an older nvidia driver to see if that helps
2007-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	like d/l from nvidia site?
2007-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	and... are you using the nvidia official driver or just the ubuntu ones through the restricted manager o.O?
2007-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mkquist	yeah, those are the ones that work
2007-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	mkquist	DARKGuy	just checked the box, worked before
