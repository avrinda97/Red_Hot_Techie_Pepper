2007-03-26T11:19:00.000Z	jusama14		yes kbidd...i installed w32 codecs if that's the codec pack you are talking about
2007-03-26T11:19:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	specify a different video out: mplayer -vo xv movie.avi
2007-03-26T11:19:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	if that works we can fix the GUI version too
2007-03-26T11:20:00.000Z	jusama14	crdlb	how do i do that
2007-03-26T11:20:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	type that in a terminal
2007-03-26T11:22:00.000Z	jusama14	crdlb	so i just type mplayer -vo xv movie.avi that into terminal?
2007-03-26T11:23:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	you can put the stream url in place of "movie.avi"
2007-03-26T11:24:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	ok
2007-03-26T11:24:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	pastebin not paste
2007-03-26T11:26:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	does it start playing after that?

2007-03-26T11:28:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	I don't think you have the right codecs
2007-03-26T11:29:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	yep, but I tested it on a different distribution
2007-03-26T11:42:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	do any streams work?
2007-03-26T11:44:00.000Z	crdlb	jusama14	you need to rightclick on it, choose preferences, go to the video tab, and select "Xv"
