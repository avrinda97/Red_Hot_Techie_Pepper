2010-08-01T00:39:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: but openoffice is very smiliar, free, and runs on windows, mac and gnu/linux
2010-08-01T00:40:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: get someone from google to talk to them about chrome and their Chrome Frame for IE
2010-08-01T00:41:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: using free/open source alternatives will cost less, be more manageable in the long term
2010-08-01T00:42:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: yes it does, please download a copy and conduct a feasibility test for your corporate
2010-08-01T00:43:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: you may also use the free web-based office suit from mircosoft to open any problematic documents
2010-08-01T00:44:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: also check http://office.microsoft.com/

2010-08-01T00:48:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: google releases a very good web browser for windows, mac and gnu/linux, it can be even used as the "engine" for existing IE installations, giving you the advantage of having the same IE interface but using a modern, very secure browser
2010-08-01T00:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz		jelam: unless they use very specific technologies, like activex, using a different modern browser, won't be a problem at all
2010-08-01T00:50:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	we require that our clients do not use a different browser :(
2010-08-01T00:55:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	i'm not allowed to comment on the skill of my web developers ;)
2010-08-01T00:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	no need to comment, it's obvious
2010-08-01T01:02:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	you'll gain a lot more than what you'll lose in the short term
2010-08-01T01:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	we don't offer windows support
2010-08-01T01:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	setup Â pilot test experiment with only a small group of employees (convert them completely to gnu/llinux) and see how things go,
2010-08-01T01:04:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	this is a good idea that i think i'll put to test :)
2010-08-01T01:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	and if you encounter any problems with gnu/linux software, come here and ask
2010-08-01T01:04:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	in the meantime, is there a way i can move the rest of my business back to windows and internet explorer?
2010-08-01T01:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	back up your data, reinstall, restore backups, etc, pretty typical process
2010-08-01T01:06:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	we don't take backups of workstations - only the file and network servers
2010-08-01T01:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	we can't help you if you don't keep backups
2010-08-01T01:07:00.000Z	jeiam	ilovefairuz	i see - is there a way i can restore the copies of windows WITHOUT backups? ://
2010-08-01T01:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jeiam	please stick to ubuntu-related questions
