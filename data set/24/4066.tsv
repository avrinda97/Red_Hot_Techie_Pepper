2007-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	DeNewbie		hi, when i play video files (mpeg,wmv) i only have the voice, and the screen is blue. is there any solution to that?
2007-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	get the codecs for it
2007-07-19T10:32:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	what media player you using?
2007-07-19T10:33:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	totem/mplayer what is the codec? i've already installed gstreamer-ffmpeg and w32codecs
2007-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	install all the gstreamer except ones that end in -doc or -dbg, and as for mplayer I don't know how to get it fully functional
2007-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	: i have already done that,
2007-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	did you miss any?
2007-07-19T10:34:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	grab em all not just one it wants
2007-07-19T10:35:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	usually when my media player fails I fall back to vlc
2007-07-19T10:35:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	no, i have installed even the docs lol
2007-07-19T10:35:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	its 10.0 gstreamer you installed right? those older ones might mess it up
2007-07-19T10:35:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	there is no difference between vlc,totem or mplayer the screen is blue in all of them :(
2007-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	blue!? it should be blank
2007-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	some sort of custom theme you got going?
2007-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	i installed 10.0 , no it's blue!
2007-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	no, my window manager is wmii2 a very basic one
2007-07-19T10:36:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	I think the default is a black blankness, perhaps the video is playing but its blue.. is there supposed to be a picture?
2007-07-19T10:37:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	I have never tried that before do you have link to their website?
2007-07-19T10:38:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	nvm I found it, looks nice. I usually use icewm for light weight ones
2007-07-19T10:38:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	wmii2? it's great it's the vim of window managers it's in the repository
2007-07-19T10:38:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	vim!? eep! *hides underneath desk*
2007-07-19T10:39:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	I prefer green or teal
2007-07-19T10:39:00.000Z	gerro	DeNewbie	does it work okay if you login to another window manager session?
2007-07-19T10:40:00.000Z	DeNewbie	gerro	i like vim, after a while it becomes one of the most valuable things you have :D
