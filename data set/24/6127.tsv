2006-01-06T10:00:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
2006-01-06T10:00:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 also, apt-get install build-essential (most likely what you are looking for as well)
2006-01-06T10:00:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	installed that too, nothing
2006-01-06T10:01:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	idk its looking in/usr/src/linux/include
2006-01-06T10:01:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 What error/issue are you having, there are issues with GCC 3.4 and the newer GCC with breezy.
2006-01-06T10:02:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	its just asking for those headers.. Im installing Vmware
2006-01-06T10:03:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	i exported the gcc3.4 now, see if it works
2006-01-06T10:03:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 You have build-essential, kernel-source, and linux-headers-`uname -r` right?
2006-01-06T10:03:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	yeppers
2006-01-06T10:03:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 Ok, that is a known issue with the Nvidia drivers as well (that's where I remember if from), hopefully that'll fix it.
2006-01-06T10:04:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	that did it
2006-01-06T10:04:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 Sweetness ;)
2006-01-06T10:04:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	got a bunch of other erros though :(
2006-01-06T10:04:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 There isn't a deb package for VMWware?
2006-01-06T10:04:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	is there?
2006-01-06T10:05:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	(im running dapper right now)
2006-01-06T10:16:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	Enroute
2006-01-06T10:18:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 Check Google, seeing lots of folks with same issues on Kernel 2.6.x
2006-01-06T10:19:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	what exactly is the problem though? some header im missing?
2006-01-06T10:19:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 No, I think it's a header/kernel version difference, with 2.6.x not being supported by vmware.
2006-01-06T10:20:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 But that's just a SWAG.
2006-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	might it be because im running the new kernal 2.6.15?
2006-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	evilghost	Delvien	 That would be my guess :)
2006-01-06T10:24:00.000Z	Delvien	evilghost	crap... i need to put some Mp3s on my Philips Gogear
