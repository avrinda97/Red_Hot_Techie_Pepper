2005-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X		none of us actually type in the names, we all use Tab Complete XD
2005-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X		believe me, it becomes reflex after a while
2005-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X		so reflexive that you do it in IMs ;)
2005-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	Razor-X		anyways...., try the netinstall of Ubuntu, balistic2
2005-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	Razor-X		you know, a USB external CDrom drive is cheaper than a USB stick ;)
2005-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	Razor-X		but yeah, that's definitely possible
2005-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	Razor-X		distros like Flonix allow that
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	Razor-X		see, the reason I logged off, is because I had to type your name (balistic2) without tab complete XD
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	Razor-X		what size USB stick do you have, balistic2 ?
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	Razor-X		B22: no no, it's fine ;)
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	1gb
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	awesome
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	would an ipod do the trick as well
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	I think we can get this working (with a little research), and I think i'll write a wiki guide on it
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	as long as it can store files, yeah
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	yes i know
2005-08-08T13:55:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	do you have aim
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	i'm actually going through some docs now
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	ok
2005-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	can your laptop boot from the USB stick?
2005-08-08T13:58:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	i have no idea...
2005-08-08T13:58:00.000Z	B22	Razor-X	i just know the damn thing has a usb slot
2005-08-08T13:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	B22	arrghhh, I have to go
