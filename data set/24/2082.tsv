2009-04-26T07:01:00.000Z	secret9011		I upgraded my Linux Dell laptop to Jaunty and now I can't play any videos.
2009-04-26T07:02:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	did you download the codecs? you might need to re-download them.
2009-04-26T07:02:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	how do I do that?
2009-04-26T07:02:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	or inslall vlc
2009-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	I already have vlc.  All the players crash with the "badalloc insufficient resources for operation" error
2009-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	oh... thats weird..
2009-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	try re-loading vlc
2009-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	like apt-get remove and apt-get install?
2009-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	yes
2009-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	tried that
2009-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	have you googled the error message?
2009-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	yes, it seems to be quite common
2009-04-26T07:05:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	but doesn't seem to apply to me
2009-04-26T07:06:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	what was the error again?
2009-04-26T07:06:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	"badalloc insufficient resources for operation"
2009-04-26T07:08:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	and you upgraded?
2009-04-26T07:08:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	the trouble started after I upgraded to Jaunty.
2009-04-26T07:08:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	It was working fine before.
2009-04-26T07:08:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	did you upgrade or do a clean install?
2009-04-26T07:09:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	upgrade from 8.10
2009-04-26T07:09:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	the easiest way would probably be to do a clean install for 9.04 because upgrading can produce problems
2009-04-26T07:10:00.000Z	secret9011	Criten	clean install is not an option
2009-04-26T07:10:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	oh..
2009-04-26T07:14:00.000Z	Criten	secret9011	see if this can help you at all
