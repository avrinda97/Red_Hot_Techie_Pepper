2011-12-18T12:10:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	 sudo chown root.usersname nameoffolder
2011-12-18T12:11:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	then sudo chmod -r g+rw folder
2011-12-18T12:11:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	my folder is downloadesfile and user is taran. How do I set permssions?
2011-12-18T12:13:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	in a terminal type this: sudo chown -R root.taran
2011-12-18T12:16:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	ok.thanks
2011-12-18T12:23:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	But I want to set permission for all folders and subfolders.what to do?
2011-12-18T12:25:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	the -R flags means dig all the way into the folder to the bottom
2011-12-18T12:25:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	then I should get access to subfolders also but thats not happening
2011-12-18T12:26:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	did you put the -R flag on both commands?
2011-12-18T12:27:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	This I wrote "sudo chown -R root.taran Downloads"
2011-12-18T12:27:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	inside Downlaods there are song,picture folders which can be seen but when double clicked it does not open
2011-12-18T12:30:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	did you also do:  sudo chmod -R g+rw Downloads
2011-12-18T12:31:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	I did sudo chmod -R g+rw Downloads also
2011-12-18T12:32:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	In which directory do I give this command
2011-12-18T12:32:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	that will give group taran the ability to read and write to it and the sub folders and files
2011-12-18T12:33:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	taran is assumed to be a member of group taran
2011-12-18T12:33:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	I did but still cant access a folder named Pictures. "you dont have permission necessary to view the contents" message
2011-12-18T12:34:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	from any directory if you use /full/path/to/Downloads instead of just Downloads
2011-12-18T12:34:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	so was done but subfolders still inaccessbile
2011-12-18T12:35:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	Pictures is inside Downloads?
2011-12-18T12:36:00.000Z	researcher123	w30	its outside.I will correct this error n report
2011-12-18T12:37:00.000Z	w30	researcher123	or are Pictures and Downloads inside downloadfile? these commands don't go side ways
