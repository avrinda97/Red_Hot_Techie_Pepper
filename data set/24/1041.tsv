2010-11-27T02:25:00.000Z	Nadav		whats the command to change password for a user?
2010-11-27T02:25:00.000Z	Nadav		passwd -?
2010-11-27T02:26:00.000Z	Nadav		i know what sudo is, I need to change a password for a user
2010-11-27T02:26:00.000Z	Nadav		so sudo passwd but what is the parameter I need to use?
2010-11-27T02:26:00.000Z	Nadav		the help file doesnt specify something about change
2010-11-27T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	sorry, I was referring to your question in freenode
2010-11-27T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	sudo passwd <accountname>
2010-11-27T02:27:00.000Z	Nadav	guntbert	Im not going to use it, I download a ubuntu machine I just want to change the user password, not the root
2010-11-27T02:28:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	understood :-) (btw even if we advise against something you are free to do it anyway :-))
2010-11-27T03:02:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	at the moment: is it set to NAt or bridged?
2010-11-27T03:08:00.000Z	Nadav	guntbert	at the moment it set as Bridged
2010-11-27T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	ok, do you have a DHCP server in your real network?
2010-11-27T03:10:00.000Z	Nadav	guntbert	yeah I got a dhcp server
2010-11-27T03:10:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	ok, then tell your guest system to use "automatic" method for IP configuration
2010-11-27T03:12:00.000Z	Nadav	guntbert	the guest system is ubuntu, I'm pretty sure its the default?
2010-11-27T03:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	unlikely, please look at the config
2010-11-27T03:13:00.000Z	Nadav	guntbert	ifconfig? plase be patient with me :)
2010-11-27T03:14:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	no worries: in the guest right click on the network icon, select edit connections, on the "wired " tab there is one connection, click on "edit"
2010-11-27T03:15:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	thats what I wanted to check
2010-11-27T03:17:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	now close that again, and in a terminal type: ip ad, you should get several lines - after eth0.... ther is one starting with "inet..."
2010-11-27T03:18:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	not that one, further down
2010-11-27T03:19:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	I see - did you enable/connect the virtual adapter in vbox?
2010-11-27T03:23:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	the beauty of NAT - 192.168.189.131 is inside the virtual network of virtual box
2010-11-27T03:29:00.000Z	guntbert	Nadav	not quite, all VMs are within the virtual network, they will have a 192.168.189.xxx and their gateway will be 192.168.189.2 ( iirc), the vbox itself takes care of the rest
