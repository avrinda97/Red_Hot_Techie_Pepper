2004-12-19T10:13:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	I miss the links to my directories..
2004-12-19T10:13:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	I haven't used it enough to complain or praise more than that yet.
2004-12-19T10:13:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	no home dir and such?
2004-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	no links to them in a drop down menu.
2004-12-19T10:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	I don't think kde plays nice with ubu
2004-12-19T10:18:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	I know, it's a shame. KDE is slightly better than gnome.
2004-12-19T10:18:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	what is it that you miss the most of kde then? (that you can't get/have in gnome?)
2004-12-19T10:20:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	ah you mean when you have and kde and gnome at the same time
2004-12-20T07:59:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	depends what probs you are referring to;)
2004-12-20T08:00:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	your upgrade issues
2004-12-20T08:00:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	oh yah, I fixed that. now I'm trying to find decent documentation on how to mess with routing.
2004-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	how's it going?
2004-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	kinda. I still haven't upgraded to 2.6.9  because I want to wait for the restricted modules to be updated.
2004-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	didn't they do that today?
2004-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	I'll have to check. I've been extremely hung over all day and haven't done anything;)
2004-12-22T10:33:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	that?
2004-12-22T10:51:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	it is usually because there have to be other packages installed
2004-12-22T10:51:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	how do I get it to tell me though?
2004-12-22T10:52:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	do it through a console
2004-12-22T10:54:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	billytwowilly	close synaptic, open a console type sudo apt-get upgrade and it will tell you what will be held back
2004-12-22T10:55:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Tsjoklat	I know what will be held back.
