2007-12-30T23:36:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	I have the ndiswrapper program installed
2007-12-30T23:35:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	are you using bcm43xx or ndiswrapper
2007-12-30T23:37:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	have you tried bcm43xx?
2007-12-30T23:37:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	the firmware? I tried installing the firmware and it FLAT OUT refused to connect
2007-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	yes that is a bug in the installer for restricted manager in feisty
2007-12-30T23:38:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	one sec i will get you an updated link to the firmware
2007-12-30T23:39:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	i did not use the restricted manager
2007-12-30T23:39:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty
2007-12-30T23:39:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	it has a working link to the firmware
2007-12-30T23:40:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	the bug is in bcm43xx-fwcutter not restricted manager. sorry i was unclear
2007-12-30T23:40:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	but i hear using the firmware restircts the connection to 11mbps?
2007-12-30T23:40:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	and ndiswrapper caps at the normal 54mbps
2007-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	i have always used the firmware and found it to be more reliable than the ndiswrapper
2007-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	but then again here in the states i can never approach 11 mbps anyway due to isp limitations so the extra speed doesn't matter to me
2007-12-30T23:41:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	very well i shall try it
2007-12-30T23:42:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	thank you very much for the chance to at least fix this. you have no clue how much grief i have gotten from it
2007-12-30T23:42:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	no problem unfortunately the bcm4310 is the worst supported of all bcm drivers so good luck
2007-12-30T23:43:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	it will get better in hardy with the bcm rather than bcm43xx driver
2007-12-30T23:43:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	yeah i want to rip the piece of crap out of my laptop an replace it with a non-suck one
2007-12-30T23:45:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	you know it gives me problems on vista to?
2007-12-30T23:45:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	really...i've only ever used a bcm4318 and i had to revert back to xp simply because the linux drivers didn't support leap
2007-12-30T23:48:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	when i get to the iwconfig part, the tut says that i will se an eth device as wireless. but i still see wlan0. should i be doing all this when i am still connected?
2007-12-30T23:49:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	arialth	it shouldn't matter if it is eth1 or wlan0 as the device
2007-12-30T23:51:00.000Z	arialth	infinitycircuit	that page is certainly going into bookmarks for later perusal
