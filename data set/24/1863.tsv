2009-07-18T01:59:00.000Z	h00k		I freshly installed Jaunty today, coming back from Karmic Koala (leaving my /home untouched) and I don't have autocomplete with apt-get in my terminal and I forget how to re-enable it.
2009-07-18T01:59:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	try reinstalling bash-completion
2009-07-18T02:00:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	bash itself autocompletes, just not with apt-get things
2009-07-18T02:01:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	silly question, does aptitude autocomplete?
2009-07-18T02:02:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	actually, it appears that sudo 'apt+tab' won't even give the option for apt-get or aptitude
2009-07-18T02:03:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	single-tab or double-tab? there are alot of apt-* binaries
2009-07-18T02:03:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	either
2009-07-18T02:04:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	pressing it once should go alphabetically through the options available (apt-get, then aptitude)
2009-07-18T02:05:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	pastbin your ~/.bashrc file please.
2009-07-18T02:05:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	pastebin*
2009-07-18T02:06:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	I didn't have one, its blank with a custom alias I had set
2009-07-18T02:06:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	I believe it blanked itself after installing karmic
2009-07-18T02:06:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	I don't have a template to go by, just my one alias.
2009-07-18T02:06:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	hmm, I"m not entirely sure how to regenerate it, but .bashrc controls bash completion.
2009-07-18T02:07:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	let me try a dpkg-reconfigure bash
2009-07-18T02:07:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	okay, delete your old bashrc though
2009-07-18T02:08:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	yeah, it didn't recreate it.
2009-07-18T02:10:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	I did
2009-07-18T02:10:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	I did cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
2009-07-18T02:10:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	Fix it?
2009-07-18T02:10:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	Yep.
2009-07-18T02:11:00.000Z	h00k	jander991	sometimes it takes talking with someone and bouncing ideas to get my brane working
2009-07-18T02:11:00.000Z	jander991	h00k	Nice.  I was about to send you a link to my bashrc heh. Good to know /etc/skel exists.
