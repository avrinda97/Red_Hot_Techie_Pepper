2008-10-17T19:35:00.000Z	chadeldridge		All .. i have a backup script that runs every night that I need to run as root, is there a way to script becoming root at the start of it?
2008-10-17T19:35:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	You run it from cron ?
2008-10-17T19:35:00.000Z	chadeldridge		akhanu yes
2008-10-17T19:36:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	I'd say if the script itself is set with root:root ownership, there shouldn't be problems.
2008-10-17T19:36:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	also, is it root's cron or some other user's cron ?
2008-10-17T19:36:00.000Z	chadeldridge		akhanu:  i guess i should say i have it running in kcron, i dont see any user based options there
2008-10-17T19:36:00.000Z	chadeldridge		ill set it up to run in cron then and see what happens. thanks
2008-10-17T19:37:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	is kcron used systemwide or user speciffic? I don't know anything about kcron
2008-10-17T19:37:00.000Z	chadeldridge		akhanu: user based ..
2008-10-17T19:38:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	then your srcipt will be run as beloging to that user. You have to make it belong to root's crontable ?
2008-10-17T19:38:00.000Z	Akhanu`		(drop the question marke there)
2008-10-17T19:38:00.000Z	Akhanu`		mark*
2008-10-17T19:38:00.000Z	chadeldridge		akhanu:  yep thats what im doing now :-D
2008-10-17T19:38:00.000Z	chadeldridge		thanks
2008-10-17T19:40:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	When you open a terminal and type  "crontab -l" does anything appear ?
2008-10-17T19:40:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	as user, not root
2008-10-17T19:41:00.000Z	chadeldridge		Akhanu: yeah i have the jobs scheduled by kcron
2008-10-17T19:41:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	so  "crontab -l" reveals the line that starts the script, right ?
2008-10-17T19:42:00.000Z	chadeldridge	Akhanu`	yes that is correct
2008-10-17T19:42:00.000Z	chadeldridge		akhanu:  45 17 * * * /backup.scr
2008-10-17T19:44:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	What I'd do, is copy that line, save it somewhere temporary. Then remove the setting from your kcron configuration. Then get root access with "sudo bash".  And last, type "crontab -e" (as root this time) and paste there that line of before.
2008-10-17T19:44:00.000Z	chadeldridge		sweet thanks
2008-10-17T19:45:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	after saving and opting out from "crontab -e" you'd have that same entry in the root's crontab, not the users.
2008-10-17T19:46:00.000Z	Akhanu`	chadeldridge	WARNING! In the crontab line, put the full path of the script!
