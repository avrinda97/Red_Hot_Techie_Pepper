2005-11-18T15:15:00.000Z	omeg		Hmm... I don't have permission to visit my external hard drive sd1.
2005-11-18T15:15:00.000Z	omeg		*sda1
2005-11-18T15:16:00.000Z	omeg		Why can't I view my external hard drive? I don't have permission for some reason even though this is a clean install.
2005-11-18T15:17:00.000Z	omeg		I am obviously the owner as I'm the only user on the entire system.
2005-11-18T15:17:00.000Z	omeg		"Root" seems to be the owner.
2005-11-18T15:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	do you know what root is?
2005-11-18T15:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	on linux just because you are the only user does not mean you own everything
2005-11-18T15:18:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	I doubt it.. how are you attempting to mount it?
2005-11-18T15:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	how are you mounting the ones that work fine?
2005-11-18T15:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	can you tell me what is in /etc/fstab for the external drive?
2005-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	what do you do to access the drive?
2005-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	click on something?
2005-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	aha... can you paste /etc/fstab to #flood?
2005-11-18T15:21:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	listen to bob2 ... he is more on the case :)
2005-11-18T15:47:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	can you use the command line?
2005-11-18T15:44:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	I assure you it can be done in ubuntu :)
2005-11-18T15:45:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	sda1 is the one you are trying to mount?
2005-11-18T15:47:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	it is easier for me :)
2005-11-18T15:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	I am leaving you in the trusty hands of bob2 :)
2005-11-18T15:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	it should be mount ro of course
2005-11-18T15:49:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	add noauto,ro,users
2005-11-18T15:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	instead of defaults
2005-11-18T15:50:00.000Z	omeg	lesshaste	er... how?
2005-11-18T15:50:00.000Z	lesshaste	omeg	ask bob2  :) bye
