2008-08-13T15:35:00.000Z	DRLD		hi... just wondering if anyone has a similar problem... when i scroll in firefox, the words get jumbled and i can't read anything. how do i fix this?
2008-08-13T15:36:00.000Z	DRLD		it's not just firefox
2008-08-13T15:36:00.000Z	DRLD		it happens in plenty of apps... even this one
2008-08-13T15:36:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	what video driver?
2008-08-13T15:36:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	nvidia
2008-08-13T15:37:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	version?
2008-08-13T15:37:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	169.12
2008-08-13T15:38:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	try nv to check if it'S the driver
2008-08-13T15:39:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	nv?
2008-08-13T15:40:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	nv is the open source nvidia drievr. as opposed to the proprietary one you are using right now
2008-08-13T15:41:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	ah i c. does it have 3d support?
2008-08-13T15:41:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	no. but you still want to use it to do bug testing
2008-08-13T15:42:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	i assume that if i turn off the proprietary nvidia driver it will automatically use nv?
2008-08-13T15:43:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	not unless you uninstall it IIRC. is "nvidia" in your xorg.conf? if yes, change that to "nv"
2008-08-13T15:44:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	done... what do i do to reset x?
2008-08-13T16:16:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	still here?
2008-08-13T16:18:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	glad yur still here. inet died for a few min. i changed it to nv and it didn't fix the problem. however, i also checked on my desktop which is using an ati chipset... and the same problem occurs. this computer currently has compiz off and the problem still occurs. could there be some option i need to change?
2008-08-13T16:19:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	it actually shouldn't happen. especially not across different hardware
2008-08-13T16:20:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	but I dunno what could be it. driver or compiz are the most likely culprits I'd said
2008-08-13T16:20:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	a friend said it may be a problem with xgl... i know it's vague but do you have any idea what he might be talking about?
2008-08-13T16:21:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	xserver-xgl, if you have that still installed, uninstall it
2008-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	i dunno what happened... but after i restarted xserver... it fixed the problem
2008-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	wols_	DRLD	hard to diagnose errors like this
2008-08-13T16:31:00.000Z	DRLD	wols_	yah heh
