2006-09-17T11:40:00.000Z	mrbrdo		i get a lot of Ign (ignored) lines when doing aptitude update: http://paste.uni.cc/10159 someone plz?
2006-09-17T11:41:00.000Z	mrbrdo		it's for the translation repos
2006-09-17T11:41:00.000Z	mrbrdo		can someone please take a look at it
2006-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	that's not a problem
2006-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	how so?
2006-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	why is it displaying that? why is it ignoring the lines?
2006-09-17T11:42:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	because the repositories are broken
2006-09-17T11:43:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	that's what you expect from a *beta* release
2006-09-17T11:43:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	so edgy did that? but it doesn't break anything?
2006-09-17T11:43:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	once again, there's no problem; just wait a few days and update again
2006-09-17T11:44:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	oh, it's only a current state, and will work later?
2006-09-17T11:44:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	well, I'm not a seer, but I guess it should; it shows you never used debian unstable :)
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	actually i did O_o
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	and you didn't get those? :)
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	never got that though
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	nope
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	well lucky you :)
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	but i didn't update so often though
2006-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	it might be i just didn't notice it though :)
2006-09-17T11:46:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	anyway, just wait a few days or till edgy is officially released, it will be solved then
2006-09-17T11:46:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	it's going to be released soon? :P
2006-09-17T11:46:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	go to #ubuntu+1
2006-09-17T11:47:00.000Z	mrbrdo	magnet	ok thanks a lot :)
2006-09-17T11:47:00.000Z	magnet	mrbrdo	np, good luck :)
