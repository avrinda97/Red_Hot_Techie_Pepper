2009-11-08T03:02:00.000Z	eribol		but when i installed new iso it did not work
2009-11-08T03:02:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	so you say you updated 9.10 to a netbook config from some other config?
2009-11-08T03:03:00.000Z	eribol	folding-install	i used wireless with ndiswrapper when upgraded
2009-11-08T03:03:00.000Z	eribol		but i installed(no upgrade) and it does not work
2009-11-08T03:04:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	i'm trying to tell what's dif't between your working and broken configs, please assist
2009-11-08T03:04:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	so, you started in a fresh partition for the netbook broken config yes?
2009-11-08T03:05:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	is the hardware any different between the 2?
2009-11-08T03:06:00.000Z	eribol		no folding-install

2009-11-08T03:06:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	what build did you have before the update(not upgrade)
2009-11-08T03:07:00.000Z	eribol	folding-install	nothing realy:)
2009-11-08T03:08:00.000Z	folding-install	eribol	i'm confused, you say you had something working for wireless before
