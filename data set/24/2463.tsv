2008-12-03T19:33:00.000Z	Joerie		I'm new to linux and have ubuntu 8.04 now, and having graphic driver problems. Anyone experienced with that?
2008-12-03T19:33:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	what video card do you have?
2008-12-03T19:36:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	I've never heard about GMA 245. are you sure you got the model right? Try lspci|grep -i GMA to see what's being reported
2008-12-03T19:48:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	i've just tried to access the terminal but the lower part of my screen is frozen now xD (when returning) Not really sure what's happened here ...
2008-12-03T19:49:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	you meant the lower panel? or the lower half of your screen
2008-12-03T19:52:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	anyway it was a typo, i meant Intel GMA 945...
2008-12-03T19:52:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	lol, 945 is fairly common
2008-12-03T19:52:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	it took me a googleing to confirm that there's no GMA 245, lol
2008-12-03T19:53:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	just a mall typo :)
2008-12-03T19:54:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	if 945 is fairly common, are the graphic driver problems as well?
2008-12-03T19:54:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	ok what problem do you have with it?
2008-12-03T19:54:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	basicly, i have the same problems i would have when installing a new copy of windows (any version) an not yet installing graphic drivers...
2008-12-03T19:55:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	you meant you don't have access to hi-resolutions?
2008-12-03T19:57:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	first save any opened document you have, then press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill your X, should get rid of your freezing problem
2008-12-03T20:00:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	its solved, thanks
2008-12-03T20:01:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	nice to know that, do you know which graphic driver are you using?
2008-12-03T20:07:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	when trying to see my drivers, it says "no proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
2008-12-03T20:08:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	press Alt+F2 and type "gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" without the quote and press ENTER
2008-12-03T20:08:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	this should open your configuration file for X, look for "Section "Device"" in it
2008-12-03T20:09:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	you should see something like "Driver "intel"" in the Section labeled "Devices"
2008-12-03T20:13:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	do a "glxinfo|grep render"
2008-12-03T20:20:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	he doesn't take that command...
2008-12-03T20:21:00.000Z	Rainarrow	Joerie	sorry, are you running GNOME or KDE?
2008-12-03T20:35:00.000Z	Joerie	Rainarrow	im using gnome (should you not have read it :))
