2010-08-14T06:00:00.000Z	StepNjump		is anybody here familiar on how to set-up a server under ubuntu
2010-08-14T06:00:00.000Z	StepNjump		I need a wiz
2010-08-14T06:00:00.000Z	Sylphid	StepNjump	what type of server
2010-08-14T06:01:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	I don't know
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	we are starting a small company
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	and the money is not yet coming in
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	but I would like to set up a server so we can all connect to it
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	and work from our own homes
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	Sylphid	StepNjump	well you need to know what kind of data you are serving before going any futher
2010-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	We are 4
2010-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	Sylphid	StepNjump	are you looking for file sharing?
2010-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	I was thinking of getting an opensource VPN
2010-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	Yes file sharing but also maybe openproj
2010-08-14T06:03:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	ticketing software so we can assign each other's tasks, etc
2010-08-14T06:04:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	no Sylphid just for our own internal use
2010-08-14T06:04:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	I don't even know how to install applications under linux
2010-08-14T06:04:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	is it a big job?
2010-08-14T06:05:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	I found some free VPN's we could use
2010-08-14T06:05:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	but our resources at the moment are pretty scarce
2010-08-14T06:05:00.000Z	Sylphid	StepNjump	If you are unsure of what you are doing with a system then it is unwise to store critical data on that system
2010-08-14T06:06:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	right
2010-08-14T06:06:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	do you think you might be interested in helping us out
2010-08-14T06:06:00.000Z	StepNjump	Sylphid	keeping in mind we might be able to pay you in the future?
2010-08-14T06:09:00.000Z	Sylphid	StepNjump	request for proposal
