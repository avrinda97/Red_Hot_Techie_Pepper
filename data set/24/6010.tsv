2006-06-01T14:54:00.000Z	Bizzeh		ok
2006-06-01T14:54:00.000Z	Bizzeh		what is the actual iso i need to INSTALL 6.06
2006-06-01T14:54:00.000Z	Bizzeh		and not just run the stupid live cd
2006-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	Bizzeh		i got http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-amd64.iso and it is just a live cd
2006-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	Bizzeh		why have the live cd, not marked as such
2006-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	click on the "install" and install it to your hard drive
2006-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	the desktop, i.e. the pretty picture with file icons on it
2006-06-01T14:59:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	the ati instructions ubotu mentioned show you how
2006-06-01T15:00:00.000Z	Bizzeh	xanavim	they show me how to do it, in an installed ubuntu
2006-06-01T15:01:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	there's a good chance using fglrx will only give you fast 3d
2006-06-01T15:01:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	it probably won't solve your problem
2006-06-01T15:01:00.000Z	Bizzeh	xanavim	there is a better chance that it will give me a gui
2006-06-01T15:02:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	to cut down on cds
2006-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	there's no command-line tool there to start the install?
2006-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	Bizzeh	xanavim	thats why im in here
2006-06-01T15:05:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	did you see that?
2006-06-01T15:06:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	you're not reading
2006-06-01T15:07:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	download the alternate cd installer
2006-06-01T15:07:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	download the alternate cd installer
2006-06-01T15:08:00.000Z	Bizzeh	xanavim	so, wasting more money, because ubuntu doesnt lable their iso's properly, and doesnt cater to their users needs
2006-06-01T15:08:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	are you trolling in here or what?!?!
2006-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	how is a cd a waste of money?  they're what, $0.20
2006-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	Bizzeh	xanavim	no, im trying to figure out why people wont take on that the livecd is read only and you cannot write to it
2006-06-01T15:09:00.000Z	xanavim	Bizzeh	you can't write to a burned cd
