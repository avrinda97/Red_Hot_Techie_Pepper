2004-09-07T09:36:00.000Z	ploum		no question
2004-09-07T09:36:00.000Z	ploum		The config is the same as before
2004-09-07T09:37:00.000Z	ploum		X works (I will try to see if it works the first time after a reboot)
2004-09-07T09:37:00.000Z	ploum		GDM is still in Deutch and 1152x864, like new users if I add them
2004-09-07T09:38:00.000Z	ploum		hi wally
2004-09-07T09:39:00.000Z	ploum		;-)
2004-09-07T09:41:00.000Z	ploum		you must submit it upstream
2004-09-07T09:43:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	it's in supported, but not installed with the desktop by default
2004-09-07T09:51:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	ephiphany depends on mozilla
2004-09-07T09:51:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	but epiphany is not installed
2004-09-07T09:57:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	when it's a bit more polished, it'll probably go in supported (it's not the kind of thing that everyone would use0
2004-09-11T15:23:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	it's the warty warthog release :-)
2004-09-11T15:23:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	'warty' sort of means 'patchy' or 'a bit buggy'
2004-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	and we thought the first release might be a bit warty ;)
2004-09-11T15:24:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	in french warty means "verol" and that's not pretty
2004-09-11T15:25:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	yes, indeed
2004-09-11T15:27:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	ubuntu is defined on the wiki (in the FAQ)
2004-09-11T15:27:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	sorry
2004-09-16T15:01:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	I've reported this bug
2004-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	pretty sure gstreamer.net links to their docs
2004-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	and #gstreamer is on this network, from memory
2004-09-18T06:57:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	I'm sorry ! I wrote in the wrong tab
2004-11-05T06:05:00.000Z	jdub	ploum	there's a problem with the mplayer packages atm
2004-11-05T06:05:00.000Z	ploum	jdub	ok, so this is not me
