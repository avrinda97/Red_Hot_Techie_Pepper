2011-01-05T05:43:00.000Z	kcorcoran_		a few years ago a friend had told me about mythtv.  i have recently begam migrating away from windows; is mythtv still a good application to build my media center?  i am running ubuntu 10.10 (64bit)  any insight appreciated.
2011-01-05T05:44:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	I use XBMC too...but myth is great if you plan on watching or recording live TV
2011-01-05T05:45:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	mythbuntu is just a package in ubuntu...it helps configure all the components surrounding mythtv
2011-01-05T05:46:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	if you plan to record mythtv-backend is the way to go
2011-01-05T05:47:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	I have a machine running mythtv-backend that records but all the rest of the media centers in my house use XBMC as the frontend
2011-01-05T05:47:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	yeah you should be able to find mythbuntu in synaptic...I forget the actual package name right now
2011-01-05T05:49:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 so if i understand correctly, youre using myth to perfom all your recording - but on the other workstations you use xbmc as a front end to access the media from myth?
2011-01-05T05:49:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	myth has it's quirks and is a bit of a maintenance nightmare...also somewhat sluggish compared to XBMC...
2011-01-05T05:49:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	yep...!
2011-01-05T05:51:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 so a few years ago the package was myth tv - has mythbuntu replaced myth tv?
2011-01-05T05:52:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	no...mythbuntu started as a seperate project based on ubuntu...eventually Ubuntu adopted the project in as a package that can just be installed (rather than a standalone OS)...mythtv is a completely separate project...mythbuntu just makes it a little easier to manage
2011-01-05T05:53:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	sry...mythbuntu makes it easier to manage and install myth tv in ubuntu... :)
2011-01-05T05:55:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	I think you just need to install mythbuntu-control-centre...it will pull the rest with dependencies...
2011-01-05T05:58:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 by dl'ing control center, will is pull the backend as well...i have search all mythbuntu and do not see the backend, nor front end
2011-01-05T05:59:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	the control center is just a piece of software to manage myth and it's environment (by adding and removing packages, AND settings etc)...so with the CC you can tell it to install just a backend for example
2011-01-05T06:03:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	check System
2011-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 thank you
2011-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	np!
2011-01-05T06:07:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 so, is this a correct assumption - i will build a mythbuntu box...and, if i throw xbmc on my laptop can i stream data from my mythbuntu box to my laptop?
2011-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	yep...the only thing you can't see in XBMC is the live recordings...so if you want to watch live TV or a show that is being recorded you will need a myth frontend
2011-01-05T06:13:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 clarification, i can stream any data, just not live data?  so a show previously recorded would play fine on xbmc laptop?
2011-01-05T06:14:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	yep... :)
2011-01-05T06:16:00.000Z	v0lksman	kcorcoran_	tell her it's worth it...my wife loves the setup now... :)
2011-01-05T06:48:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	v0lksman	 you got a second to go private?
