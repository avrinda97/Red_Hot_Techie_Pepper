2006-10-26T16:23:00.000Z	Bearcat1		I'm running Xchat, and cannot figure out how to erase old chatlogs.  any help is appreciated
2006-10-26T16:23:00.000Z	Whatsisname	Bearcat1	they are all just put in a big file, just delete them or trim them down or something
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Whatsisname		I wish there was an option to disable or enable human readable format but there doesnt appear to be one
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Bearcat1	Whatsisname	ty, but how do I do that?
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Bearcat1		I know they are all in one big file
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Whatsisname		do you know how many lines you want to trim out?
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Whatsisname		you could just do
2006-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Bearcat1	Whatsisname	yes, all of them
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Bearcat1		or most of them
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Whatsisname		if you want to blast them, just delete the log file
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Whatsisname		xchat will create a new one
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Bearcat1		I can't seem to find the delete
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Whatsisname		if you want to selectively delete blocks, I can give you a sed command that can do it
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Whatsisname	Bearcat1	rm ~/.xchat/whereverthelogis
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Bearcat1		I can I suppose highlight them and try my delete button
2006-10-26T16:25:00.000Z	Whatsisname		the log files are named
2006-10-26T16:26:00.000Z	Whatsisname		along the lines of server-#channel or something
2006-10-26T16:26:00.000Z	Whatsisname	Bearcat1	for example
2006-10-26T16:26:00.000Z	Whatsisname		if I was to delete my #ubuntu log
2006-10-26T16:26:00.000Z	Whatsisname		I would execute the command
2006-10-26T16:27:00.000Z	Whatsisname		rm ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/Ubuntuserver-#ubuntu.log
2006-10-26T16:27:00.000Z	Whatsisname		change the filename that fits your configuration
2006-10-26T16:27:00.000Z	Bearcat1	Whatsisname	ty, from the 'terminal'  is there an equivalant to the DOS  dotprompt?
2006-10-26T16:27:00.000Z	Whatsisname	Bearcat1	what?
