2007-07-15T08:08:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	type locale to see what's your encoding
2007-07-15T08:08:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	: I'm using ja_JP.UTF-8
2007-07-15T08:09:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	ok so that's utf8...if you have any problem with encoding tell me because i did have some problem
2007-07-15T08:09:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	: if it does like displaying a bunch of ??????? like when I use KDE in Mandriva then I should stay away from ubuntu :(
2007-07-15T08:09:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	: you did ? (;_;)
2007-07-15T08:09:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	yes i had to convert iso8859-15* to utf8
2007-07-15T08:10:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	that's because windows is not utf8
2007-07-15T08:10:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	yeah I know... well I don't use windows anymore, all my file system is utf-8 now

2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	search for alien or rpm
2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	: my printer's drivers come from the turbolinux distribution
2007-07-15T08:12:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	usualy you just need a ppd file
2007-07-15T08:18:00.000Z	regis	Yukinoroh	why not using windows's driver
2007-07-15T08:18:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	regis	: I think that the windows driver is a .exe
