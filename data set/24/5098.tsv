2006-11-08T11:47:00.000Z	shrndegruv		i mean ubuntu
2006-11-08T11:47:00.000Z	shrndegruv		beryl wont work with ati, correct?
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		i like gentoo seth ;)
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		just want to try new things
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		and want easier updating on my laptop
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		its great if you want a highly configurable system
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		not if you want a highly usable and up to date system
2006-11-08T11:48:00.000Z	shrndegruv		;)
2006-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	shrndegruv		sure
2006-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	shrndegruv		but if i am going to configure a ton of use flags in ubuntu, i have to get the source and go thru the config
2006-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	"use flags" is a very gentoo centric way of thinking
2006-11-08T11:50:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	try www.sourcemage.org not gentoo and still sourcebased, and no they have no use flags either
2006-11-08T11:52:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	6.10 if your test new / is on a logical partition scrape the Desktop CD download and start a alternative cd download (textinstaller)
2006-11-08T11:54:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	if your / is not a primary partition the installer will not work, is all i meant
2006-11-08T11:57:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	guess, 30-45 was somewhere in tthat time fram on this duron 1.3ghz
2006-11-08T11:58:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	not supported
2006-11-08T11:59:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	yes
2006-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	x86 bins for you, the exact optimization i am not sure about
2006-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	it is a one size fits all kernel, if it's supported by linux, chances are the module i built for you
2006-11-08T12:09:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	/dev/hda3              19G  4.5G   13G  26% /  and that is with everything i need and stuff apt leaves behind like a ton of .deb (like a 500MB+ worth of distfiles and the like)
2006-11-08T12:10:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	no i use 4.5 out of 19
2006-11-08T12:10:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	should be under 4 if i clean it up, i do have clutter everywhere
2006-11-08T12:13:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	if / is on a extended partition the GUI installer might not work, which is what i said earlier
2006-11-08T16:21:00.000Z	morphish	shrndegruv	that is OSS, yes
