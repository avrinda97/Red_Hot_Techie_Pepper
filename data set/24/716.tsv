2011-03-20T16:54:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	i thing that you have a probleme with the rights on your d:
2011-03-20T16:55:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	how to assign rights ? as i tried but its automatically came back to previous one :S
2011-03-20T16:56:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	on your windows system, right mouse then property. somewhere you should be able tou manage right. Just ensure that everybody can read/write
2011-03-20T16:56:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	depending on what you want
2011-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	yup exactly i did, by default file access has --, when i change it to read and write i comes back to -- again
2011-03-20T17:01:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	on next stage is has group option, i guess i need to select samba share, but again its on ubuntu by default, if i change it on sambashare, i came back on ubuntu, any solution
2011-03-20T17:02:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	i think i'm missing something.
2011-03-20T17:02:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit		what
2011-03-20T17:03:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	what are you trying to do exactly ? share a windows folder from ubuntu ? or access a windows shared folder from ubuntu ?
2011-03-20T17:03:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	i am trying to share a folder from my laptop (ubuntu installed) on my desktop (ubuntu install)
2011-03-20T17:05:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	i just want to copy that folder from the D: drive of my laptop, i am able to copy it by moving that folder from D: to C: drive, but directly from D: drive i can't
2011-03-20T17:06:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	ok, that's strange. They are auto-mounted partitions ?
2011-03-20T17:07:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	i can see that folder on my network but when i tries to open it i got that error, unable to mount (failed to mount windows share)
2011-03-20T17:07:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit	jqke	yes they are auto mounted, it does not ask password on mounting
2011-03-20T17:08:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	are you sure to have the same options for both partition in you fstab file ?
2011-03-20T17:08:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	on your laptop
2011-03-20T17:08:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit		i do not now what fstab is, i am new to ubuntu.
2011-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit		know*
2011-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	oh, so you just clic on the partition then i self mount
2011-03-20T17:10:00.000Z	Last_Biscuit		yes when i click any partition,its mount automatically.
2011-03-20T17:11:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	ok so
2011-03-20T17:12:00.000Z	jqke	Last_Biscuit	can you open a new console then go to your c drive ?
