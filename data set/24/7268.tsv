2005-02-23T14:51:00.000Z	vixus	scoon	Can you help me then?
2005-02-23T14:51:00.000Z	vixus		setup bluez that is
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	well it is really easy.  I apt'd the bluez debs
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	vixus	scoon	i have a bluetooth usb dongle
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	vixus		done that
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	vixus		bluez-utils
2005-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	one thing tho, I roll my own kernel's.
2005-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	there are kernel patches in ubuntu repos that may work for you.
2005-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	vixus		:P
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	i patch my kernel's with the bluez patches and other ones.
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	if you don't know how to do that, I don't know how much help i would be.
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	i guess i'd start with looking at apt'ing the kernel  patches
2005-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	vixus	also, post w/ the forums.
