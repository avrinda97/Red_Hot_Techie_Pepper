2010-08-25T19:20:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	mount it w/out the -ro tag

2010-08-25T19:22:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	is it listed in fstab?
2010-08-25T19:25:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	ext3 filesystem is alone visible..none of ntfs
2010-08-25T19:26:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	neither the external hard drive
2010-08-25T19:26:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	try mounting it manually with -rw
2010-08-25T19:27:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	mount -o rw /dev/device_here /dir
2010-08-25T19:41:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	what would this do... mount -o rw /dev/device_here /dir
2010-08-25T19:41:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	mount your drive to a directory with read write options
2010-08-25T19:42:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	you need to find the device id
2010-08-25T19:42:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	how?
2010-08-25T19:44:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	is device id the name of storage device?
2010-08-25T19:44:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	yes its the device id, the pointer is found in the /dev directory
2010-08-25T19:47:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	a bit of explanation of the command...device_here should be the device id right?
2010-08-25T19:47:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	right
2010-08-25T19:47:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	it's the pointer to the device in the /dev directory
2010-08-25T19:48:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	type man mount in terminal
2010-08-25T19:49:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	what is the /dir for?
2010-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	thats the directory you mount the device to
2010-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	for example, i mount devices to /mnt/storage
2010-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	a5h15h	ViN86	would i have to do this everytime?
2010-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	ViN86	a5h15h	no you can add it to /etc/fstab, then have it automount on boot
