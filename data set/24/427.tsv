2011-09-13T00:52:00.000Z	tkenney	n-iCe	look for a pinhole anywhere near it, that's usually the mic

2011-09-13T00:54:00.000Z	tkenney	n-iCe	since I came late to the discussion, what program are you using to listen to the sound?
2011-09-13T00:55:00.000Z	n-iCe	tkenney	 well skype, the record one

2011-09-13T00:55:00.000Z	tkenney	n-iCe	and you can hear your typing through the speakers, but not your voice, correct?
2011-09-13T00:56:00.000Z	n-iCe	tkenney	right
2011-09-13T01:00:00.000Z	tkenney	n-iCe	it looks like the system is recognizing more than one mic device. Make sure to check your Sound configuration within Skype
2011-09-13T01:01:00.000Z	n-iCe	tkenney	 I have selected all the mic options in skype, and is the same
2011-09-13T01:05:00.000Z	tkenney	n-iCe	just out of curiosity, have you launched Skype as root from the terminal and tested the audio that way?
