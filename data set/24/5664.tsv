2009-05-14T03:37:00.000Z	linux_noob		hi could someone more awesome than me please tell me how to search my apache2 folder for references to port 80???
2009-05-14T03:38:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	grep 80 * inside /etc/apache2
2009-05-14T03:38:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	thx ur awesome
2009-05-14T03:38:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	you could even do grep -r 80 /etc/apache2/*
2009-05-14T03:42:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	none of them are conflicting
2009-05-14T03:42:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	so you're saying i must have two references to port 80 in ONE file to get the message that my por t80 is already being used then??
2009-05-14T03:42:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	2 references? in which file?
2009-05-14T03:43:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	netstat -punta | grep 80
2009-05-14T03:45:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	make that "sudo netstat -punta | grep 80"
2009-05-14T03:45:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	okay i see something using it now
2009-05-14T03:46:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	what process is it?
2009-05-14T03:46:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	im not so sure how to read what im seeing here... i see a buncha IPs... i see "tcp" and "time_wait" as well as "listen"
2009-05-14T03:46:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	pastebin the output
2009-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	- my paste bin for sudo netstat -punta | grep 80 http://www.mibbit.com/pb/hBMSq8
2009-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	so your apache is listening on port 80, which is fine
2009-05-14T03:49:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	why wont my apache restart? do i need to force it to stop or something?
2009-05-14T03:49:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	pastebin the output of sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2009-05-14T03:50:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	thanks btw, here is the apache restart: http://www.mibbit.com/pb/ZUxVt4
2009-05-14T03:52:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	do a "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop" and after that "ps -ef | grep apache" pastebin the output of the latter
2009-05-14T03:53:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	apache stopped, then "ps -ef | grep apache" http://www.mibbit.com/pb/THGA28
2009-05-14T03:55:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	try "sudo kill -9 5446 5457 5464" followed by "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start"
2009-05-14T03:55:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	no such process, is that okay?
2009-05-14T03:56:00.000Z	blizzkid	linux_noob	see if "ps -ef | grep apache" generates some output now, if there's only a line with grep it's ok
2009-05-14T03:56:00.000Z	linux_noob	blizzkid	i guess it was okay because it just started :) thank you so much
