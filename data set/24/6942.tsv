2007-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I have a program that has frozen, I cannot close it
2007-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I asked twice already
2007-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		don't know the name of it
2007-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I don't know what the process name is
2007-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	chohmann	PrimoTurbo	what program is frozen?
2007-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		it doesn't show me anything frozen
2007-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		package manager
2007-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		the one that installs deb files
2007-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		not symantec
2007-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		the deb file installer
2007-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		it says package installer
2007-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I remember there was a way to target process
2007-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		you type a command
2007-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		then drag a skull to a program and kill it
2007-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		That worked but, I always have this problem with killing processes
2007-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I don't always know their name, and they are often named different like package manager is gdebi how am I supposed ot know that?

2007-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		yes
2007-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		did anyone mention it?
2007-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo	burner	No one told me about xkill
