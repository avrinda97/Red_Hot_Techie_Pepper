2008-06-24T01:22:00.000Z	jc_		Hello
2008-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	jc_		I need to burn an ISO to disk (Samsung's ES-Tool) however I only have one DVD drive - can I somehow eject the ubuntu cd (pulling the cd itself into ram) and then burn a CD with a live setup?
2008-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	jc_		Or alternatively, can I make ubuntu boot from USB drive?
2008-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	jc_		or even the samsung es-tool from usb
2008-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	Why would you need more than one drive to burn a cd?
2008-06-24T01:24:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	I'm using the live cd
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	If you're using the live-cd then why do you need to burn another one?
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	But yea, I have no idea if that will work or not. You can try loading brasero, popping out the cd and popping in a blank, but I'd be surprised if it worked ;)
2008-06-24T01:25:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	I want to burn a samsung utility that works in its own environment (pre-OS)
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	or perhaps a better idea is to just use dd to burn it
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	dd?
2008-06-24T01:26:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	I don't understand :S
2008-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	I cant copy the file over the Ubuntu CD, which is in the drive
2008-06-24T01:29:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	So I can't remove the live CD whilst using the live distro, is there no way to do that?
2008-06-24T01:30:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	I don't know, and I'd be surprised if anyone has tried it. Just give it a whirl? What's the worst thing that could happen? I would suggest using dd to burn the cd instead of brasero or some other resource hogging GUI frontend
2008-06-24T01:31:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	But how do I eject the drive? Is there a command that overrides the "lock"?
2008-06-24T01:31:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	This probably isn't the way to go. Why not just install the cd? or pick up a USB stick and create a persistent live-usb instead of trying to do this from cd
2008-06-24T01:32:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	How would I make a ubuntu live USB drive?
2008-06-24T01:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent should work with a little luck
2008-06-24T01:38:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	My stick isn't big enough
2008-06-24T01:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	I'm not sure you can do what you want to do without either installing ubuntu to the hard drive, booting into another OS, buying another CD-rom drive, or buying a bigger USB stick
2008-06-24T01:40:00.000Z	jc_	ASULutzy	Are there any distros that can burn CDs and also will fit on my pendrive?
2008-06-24T01:40:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	Yes, damn small linux will probably work
2008-06-24T01:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jc_	you could install damn small linux to a pen drive, copy the file you want to burn to it, and then do something like dd if=/the/path/of/the/file of=/dev/cdrom
