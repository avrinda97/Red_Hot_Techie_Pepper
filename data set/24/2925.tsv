2008-07-25T06:49:00.000Z	name_name	CyberCod	what do I do edit in that file?
2008-07-25T06:49:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	sudo gedit /etc/fstab  but first I'd look in /etc/mtab to see how it is currently mounted (it is currently mounted, right)
2008-07-25T06:50:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	?
2008-07-25T06:52:00.000Z	name_name	CyberCod	I got mtab and fstab open
2008-07-25T06:52:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	is the partition/drive you want automounted currently mounted?
2008-07-25T06:53:00.000Z	name_name	CyberCod	that's a yes
2008-07-25T06:53:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	ok, copy that line (the entire line) to the fstab file save and close both... don't mess with the mtab file and don't save it
2008-07-25T06:54:00.000Z	name_name	CyberCod	should I aline the tabs in fstab?
2008-07-25T06:54:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	then reboot and see if it worked, and come back and let me know how it went
2008-07-25T06:58:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	working?
2008-07-25T06:58:00.000Z	name_name	CyberCod	it say I'm not privelegded to mount it
2008-07-25T06:59:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	did you just try browsing to it?
2008-07-25T06:59:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	you may have to change the permissions of it
2008-07-25T07:01:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	ok, and now there's no icon on the desktop at all?
2008-07-25T07:04:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	but if you want it automounted, fstab is the way to go... I would just suggest you read a little bout that
2008-07-25T07:06:00.000Z	CyberCod	name_name	what kind of file system is it?
