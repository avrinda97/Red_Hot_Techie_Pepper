2010-09-24T09:28:00.000Z	^Lestat		is "kernel" the same as OS?
2010-09-24T09:28:00.000Z	^Lestat		heh, Im already on that wiki page.
2010-09-24T09:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	with Linux, the kernel gives Linux its name, but they aren't interchangeable.
2010-09-24T09:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	an OS is more than just the kernel
2010-09-24T09:36:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	did you create a separate partition for your /home   ?
2010-09-24T09:41:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	what irc program are you using? If you type the first few characters of someone's nickname and hit tab, it should autocomplete in most cases. That makes it easier to see replies. Also, if you create a separate /home partition, you don't have to worry about breaking anything. A reinstall (manual partitioning again) you can select "don't format" for your home partition, and all of your files, settings etc will still be th

2010-09-24T09:42:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	oh I'm not sure about how Pidgin works. I hop between xchat and irssi
2010-09-24T09:42:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	Any recomends for /home partition size?
2010-09-24T09:43:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	I allow about 2GB for swap, 10GB for / and the rest for home (and another for storage) taking up the rest of the space
2010-09-24T09:44:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	I take it you are refering to /myName and not fileSystem/home ?
2010-09-24T09:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	you might want to allow a bit more for / if you're going to install all kinds of programs to try them out
2010-09-24T09:45:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	I do understand thats all subjective. Can I just use gparted to repartition?
2010-09-24T09:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	not sure what you mean. I have /home  mounted on its own partition. all users are on that one for their homes as well
2010-09-24T09:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	it's possible, but you'd be a lot better off doing a fresh install instead of trying to resize (shrink) a partition
2010-09-24T09:46:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	I would only resize if I'm enlarging one
2010-09-24T09:46:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	I would. But when I tried instlaling fresh 10.4 it failed and I did not have the different kernel load options.
2010-09-24T09:47:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	 Whatever comes with 10.4 my laptop does not like.
2010-09-24T09:47:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	I think I will lurk here and just see what I learn. Thanks for helping me ;))
2010-09-24T09:48:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	in what way? is it a fairly old laptop? I've gone from 8.04-10.10 on my laptop without too many issues
2010-09-24T09:48:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	Upgrading went well, but a direct install is what broke for me. Just loads to a blank screen after install
2010-09-24T09:48:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	sorry I missed your previous message. did you install boot loader to MBR?
2010-09-24T10:16:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	^Lestat	Destoned Once you're comfortable, don't forget to come back and help other new users
2010-09-24T10:17:00.000Z	^Lestat	Seven_Six_Two	I will most definately
