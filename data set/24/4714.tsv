2007-02-06T10:48:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic		hey does anyone know how to get https pages working in ubuntu
2007-02-06T10:48:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic		.... well it doesn't work for me :(
2007-02-06T10:49:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	are you serving https?
2007-02-06T10:50:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	are you running a server on your machine?  ...or are you just trying to browse?
2007-02-06T10:52:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	that sounds like a browser specific problem, not ubuntu.. i'm not sure I know what your problem is.. sorry
2007-02-06T10:53:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	have you tried any other browsers?
2007-02-06T10:55:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	how about galeon? (apt-get install galeon)
2007-02-06T10:55:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	it's based on mozilla as well
2007-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	any luck?
2007-02-06T11:04:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic	yellowdart	its finished downloadining and now installing
2007-02-06T11:07:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	what is the error you get??
2007-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	i dont know what is happening then..gmail is working here.. so unless you have some sort of firewall or proxy blocking you i dont know
2007-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic	yellowdart	could the problem be hardware based?
2007-02-06T11:10:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	i doubt it..never heard of a hardware problem like that
2007-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	are you on a different network than your other computers (such as you're on wifi and the others are on lan)
2007-02-06T11:12:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	yeah.. sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-02-06T11:16:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	and every other website (non-https) works?
2007-02-06T11:17:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic	yellowdart	yes
2007-02-06T11:18:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic	yellowdart	i did about:config, where should i go from there?
2007-02-06T11:30:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	all i can think of... does it allow you to login if you boot from the livecd??
2007-02-06T11:32:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	it has always worked "out of the box" every ubuntu (or any distro) installation i've ever done.. so i don't know what to suggest
2007-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	if you cant connect on the network you have, then a proxy wont help.. really a proxy would be to limit what can pass through
2007-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic	yellowdart	oh okay.
2007-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	yellowdart	MonkeyMagic	sorry i couldnt help further.. if i run across anything i'll let you know
