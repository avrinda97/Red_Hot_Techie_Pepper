2006-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	SAngeli		Hi, I need help in accieving the followings: 1) replace in Xorg "nv" with "nvidia" and therefore install nvidia drivers 2) Implement transparencies. First, could it be that I already have nvidia drivers but just need to replace nv with nvidia? If so, how to do so? manually or GUI?
2006-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	SAngeli		As for transparency I have to add the line "Option Composite Enable" in xorg.conf. Do I do so manually?
2006-09-23T06:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	np yes it is easy to edit
2006-09-23T06:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	Start by making a bakup copy from terminal type    sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/xorg.conf.backup
2006-09-23T06:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	then to edit from a terminal type    gksudo gedit  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-09-23T06:15:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	one sec. I am opening it now
2006-09-23T06:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	Can you link the instructions you are following so we know where to add that composite manager line
2006-09-23T06:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	Did you need additional help .. nv to nvidia isnt hard..  :)
2006-09-23T06:17:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	yes
2006-09-23T06:18:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	how to switch from nv to nvidia?
2006-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	you should see a line that is "nv"  just change it to "nvidia" or paste your xorg to the !pastebin and I will tell you the specific line to edit.
2006-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	I can do so
2006-09-23T06:20:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	Once I did make this change what to do to implement this change and see if it works?
2006-09-23T06:20:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	Do I have to restart Xorg? How to?
2006-09-23T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	save your change and ctrl-alt-backspace... ie restart
2006-09-23T06:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	You should see an NVIDIA whote splash screen
2007-12-22T23:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	You can use kde apps in gnome

2007-12-23T20:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SAngeli	NOt sure what you are trying to do, but make sure you have a copy of your xorg.conf first
2007-12-23T20:28:00.000Z	SAngeli	Jack_Sparrow	I have my monitor setting at 60Hz but ubuntu shows 50. So, i thought to set it up properly
