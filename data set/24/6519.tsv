2005-10-04T13:48:00.000Z	Kyral		only for that command
2005-10-04T13:49:00.000Z	Kyral		He asked if sudo gives him a Root Shell
2005-10-04T13:51:00.000Z	Kyral		You don't NEED to become root
2005-10-04T13:51:00.000Z	Kyral		you just have to preface all your commands with sudo :P
2005-10-04T13:52:00.000Z	Kyral		the best part is that sudo sets a timestamp
2005-10-04T13:52:00.000Z	Kyral		so for like 15 minutes you don't have to reenter your password
2005-10-04T13:53:00.000Z	Kyral		then use BitTornado
2005-10-04T13:54:00.000Z	Kyral		bittornado-gui
2005-10-04T13:54:00.000Z	Kyral		or something like that
2005-10-04T13:54:00.000Z	Kyral		and the JRE isn't in the Repos anymore
2005-10-04T13:55:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	Kyral	, i have a shortcut for the bittornado gui, but i want it to be accessible in the download menu of firefox like 'open with'
2005-10-04T13:56:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	try pointing firefox to the bin file
2005-10-04T13:59:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	I have no clue why the JRE was removed
2005-10-19T05:21:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	copy the installer script to the HD and then run it
2005-12-18T07:35:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	You can use the Install CD
2005-12-18T07:36:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	boot with "rescue"
2005-12-18T07:40:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	Kyral	  what do you mean 'boot with 'rescue' ?
2005-12-18T07:41:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	Yanno when you load it it stops and you have to hit enter to continue?
2005-12-18T07:54:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	fsck <device>
2005-12-18T07:54:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	You HAVE to fsck when its unmounted
2005-12-18T07:54:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	Kyral	 i tried the 'rescue' logging in the live cd...  but then it ask me on what partition i want to log
2005-12-18T07:55:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	whichever is normally mounted as /
2005-12-18T07:55:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	Kyral	 i'm on the system i want to check, and it IS mounted.
2005-12-18T07:55:00.000Z	Kyral	B_166-ER-X	uhh....then try a LiveCD
