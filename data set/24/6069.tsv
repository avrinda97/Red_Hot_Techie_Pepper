2006-01-26T06:54:00.000Z	chicken-man		I have no sound it gnome, what do I do to get it, I'm using a RealTek ALC880 sound card.
2006-01-26T06:54:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	is the sound working outside gnome ?
2006-01-26T06:55:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	Nope
2006-01-26T06:55:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	are you sure you have a kernel module loaded (if avaliable) for that specific sound card
2006-01-26T06:56:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	errrrm, well I don't have hotplug running but I don't think that has anything to do with it.
2006-01-26T06:56:00.000Z	Spliffster		if so are you using alsay ? if so have you checked dmesg and or alsa log files
2006-01-26T06:56:00.000Z	Spliffster		s/alsay/alsa/
2006-01-26T06:57:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	ehhhh ? :-/
2006-01-26T06:57:00.000Z	Spliffster		well, ubuntu has prolly a splash screen .. right ? (i havent installed it yet)
2006-01-26T06:57:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	 so you dont see the boot messages right ?
2006-01-26T06:57:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	I do, I done this from a server install
2006-01-26T06:58:00.000Z	Spliffster		you might have a look into /var/log/messages and see if there are any error messages concerning loading or using the sound card
2006-01-26T06:58:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	Ok *looks*
2006-01-26T06:59:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	if not, try "# dmesg" on a root console to see if there are any errors during boot time (sound card related errors that is)
2006-01-26T07:01:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	hmmmm I don't see anything to do with the sound card in '/var/log/messages'
2006-01-26T07:02:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	try `dmesg | less` in a root console and check if you find some sound card (or sc module) related info there
2006-01-26T07:02:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	i'll bb in 5
2006-01-26T07:02:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	Ok
2006-01-26T07:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	i can't give you ubuntu specific information but as a long time linux user i'd guess the kernel module for your card is not loaded. you can either `modprobe` it once you know which module you need (as Mr. google[tm]  what module you need). when you know it you might configure it in /etc/modules* so it is laoded at boot time. if you have the module loaded successfully and sound still doesnt work it might be ALSA related ... check /user/local
2006-01-26T07:08:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	hmmm Gnome does not list any sound devices
2006-01-26T07:09:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	so it is quiet possible that your card is not supported off the shelf by ubuntu ...
2006-01-26T07:09:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	oh well I don't need the sound to have fun with ubuntu :P
2006-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	Spliffster	chicken-man	maybe an ubuntu fan boy knows an easy way to get it done ...
2006-01-26T07:10:00.000Z	chicken-man	Spliffster	lol
