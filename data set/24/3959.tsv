2011-06-02T15:22:00.000Z	rlc		wee, i am opening the software center but it stays green all the way.
2011-06-02T15:22:00.000Z	rlc		is it related to the full disk?
2011-06-02T15:22:00.000Z	rlc		disk usage: http://pastie.org/pastes/2007694
2011-06-02T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	you can't do anything if / is full
2011-06-02T15:23:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	so, what should i do now?
2011-06-02T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	clear down some space
2011-06-02T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	then you need to increase the size of the / partition
2011-06-02T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	you've only put it as 500meg, the minimum recommended was 2GB
2011-06-02T15:24:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	how do i change the aufs?
2011-06-02T15:25:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	oh, the root
2011-06-02T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	how have you installed ubuntu to aufs ?
2011-06-02T15:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	ok, so you need to repartition your flash drive with a bigger partition thatn 500meg
2011-06-02T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	the files are installed to root, so you'll have to make that persistent
2011-06-02T15:29:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	oh, it reminds me, my flash hasn
2011-06-02T15:30:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	so, currently could i access/use the empty space? (as my flash hasn)
2011-06-02T15:36:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	if i set the whole disk for persistent space, could i access the files in it from windows? or should i partition the flash into two partitions: OS and data? what's the rule of thumb to determine the size?
2011-06-02T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	you are using a file system that is unsupported in windows
2011-06-02T15:42:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	thanks for the help. i'll create a new usb installation.
2011-06-02T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	no
2011-06-02T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	they go to /usr/bin, /etc/ /var etc etc
2011-06-02T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	you can , as root is your memory
2011-06-02T15:49:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	but when i use flash + persistent, the root would eventually be placed in the flash instead of ram?
2011-06-02T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	rlc	depends how you set it up, but yes
2011-06-02T15:49:00.000Z	rlc	ikonia	ok. thanks.
