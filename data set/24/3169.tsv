2008-06-14T19:52:00.000Z	bazhang_	LogiTech	reading now
2008-06-14T19:53:00.000Z	LogiTech	bazhang_	i think i have to buy new "soundcard" to play z5500 speakers right?
2008-06-14T19:53:00.000Z	bazhang_	LogiTech	that seems unlikely; what errors have you gotten?
2008-06-14T19:53:00.000Z	LogiTech	bazhang_	errors? no errors...
2008-06-14T19:54:00.000Z	bazhang_	LogiTech	then they should work fine; you might try switching to alsa from autodetect in the sound prefs
2008-06-14T19:55:00.000Z	LogiTech	bazhang_	no no...i havent tryed z5500 with this pc...i just wanted to know do i have to buy new soundcard to play "Z5500 speakers"
2008-06-14T19:55:00.000Z	bazhang_	LogiTech	seems unlikely though perhaps a quick ubuntu hardy z5500 ac97 would be good search terms
2008-06-14T19:57:00.000Z	LogiTech	bazhang_	but would z2300 speakers fit with this soundcard ? it seems z5500 speakers are too good for this soundcard...but what about z2300?
2008-06-14T19:57:00.000Z	bazhang_	LogiTech	not sure without a forums search
