2006-03-08T15:53:00.000Z	klaxian		does anyone have an idea why I can't GPG sign files from nautilus but i can from the command line?
2006-03-08T15:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	you may beable to (for the most part everything can be done either cli or gui) but i dont know how
2006-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	i can do it from the command line, but it's convenient from nautilus
2006-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	you can do it from both just not sure how
2006-03-08T15:57:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	in nautilus there is a Sign option when you right click a file...it asks me for my passcode but then does not create the detached signature
2006-04-23T08:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	were almost past flight 6 give it a few more days and install the beta
2006-04-23T08:34:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	cool, i'm running breezy now...do i change my apt sources to say flight6 or dapper?  if i change to dapper now, i will continue to get upgrades until the final release, right?
2006-04-23T08:34:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	thanks
2006-04-23T08:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	i would wait until 20th
2006-04-23T08:36:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	oh ya? lots of bug fixes then?
2006-04-23T08:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	if you use the first link use dapper instead of breezy
2006-04-23T08:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	it will be more for communtiy use than
2006-04-23T08:36:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	alrighty
2006-04-23T08:43:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	i followed the instructions for the upgrade in the link you supplied, but the update-manager doesn't offer me the option to upgrade to dapper
2006-04-23T08:44:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	what am i missing?  should i just change it in the apt source file and dist-upgrade?
2006-10-27T07:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	you can run them both on same system
2006-10-27T07:04:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	cool...but i don't really want to...i want to force the user to use xfce...would i remove ubuntu-desktop after?
2006-10-27T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	not htat easy
2006-10-27T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	install xubuntu-desktop set it to the default
2006-10-27T07:05:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	alrighty...how do i set the default?  in gdm.conf?
2006-10-27T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	in the gdm when you are chooseing the desktop you want to use choose xfce and it will ask you to make default
2006-10-27T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	klaxian	click make default
2006-10-27T07:06:00.000Z	klaxian	gnomefreak	cool no prob
