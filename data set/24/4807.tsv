2007-01-08T13:32:00.000Z	LSolaris		ok, phr34ck, a daemon is essentially a program that sits in the background
2007-01-08T13:32:00.000Z	LSolaris		like a windows service
2007-01-08T13:33:00.000Z	LSolaris		no
2007-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	LSolaris		daemons start up to provide a service to the system
2007-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	LSolaris		apache's httpd is a service, so is nfs and cups
2007-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	LSolaris		*daemon, not service :P
2007-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	LSolaris		no offense phr34ck, if you don't know what a daemon is, and you don't understand our rough and non-official descriptions, maybe you shouldn't have a need to know what it is
2007-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	LSolaris		hey, anyone here got nfs/smb working (as a server) in kubuntu edgy?
2007-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	LSolaris		i ain't linux stupid, but i don't get it
2007-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	samba is very different from NFS.. but NFS is definitely easier to set up.. if you have two ubuntu boxen I'd start with NFS
2007-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	LSolaris	adaptr	i get an authentication is not supported error from the client
2007-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	where ? what ? huh ? what ?
2007-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	setting up NFS takes about 5 minutes
2007-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	first , *what * are you talking about ? SMB != NFS != CUPS
2007-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	if you want top use CUPS from another Linux machine you don't need anything besides CUPS
2007-01-08T13:43:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	how did you set up the printer ?
2007-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	and CUPS works from the server ?
2007-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	LSolaris	adaptr	yes
2007-01-08T13:48:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	what type of printer is it ?
2007-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	brrr.. sorry, mate :(
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	imbecile: command not found :)
2007-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	LSolaris	adaptr	that command wasn't for you :)
2007-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	adaptr	LSolaris	never said it was
