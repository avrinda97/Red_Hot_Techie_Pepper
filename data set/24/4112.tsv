2007-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	i can't get feisty to connect in firefox
2007-07-09T07:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	 is your computer on a wired network? or wireless?
2007-07-09T07:07:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	Wired.
2007-07-09T07:07:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	can you pastebin the output of 'ifconfig eth0'  ?
2007-07-09T07:08:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	my friend put his on  his laptop and it worked right out of the box
2007-07-09T07:09:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	but i don't know how to 'pastebin'
2007-07-09T07:09:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	if I understand properly, you're saying that the cable, connection, etc., is known to be working -- true? -- but that your network configuration may not be correct. True?
2007-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	highlight the output of 'ifconfig eth0' in your terminal window, shift-ctrl-c to copy it. go to paste.ubuntu-nl.org and paste up there, then copy the URL and point me to it, here :)
2007-07-09T07:11:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	but i can't paste it to the internet, because i can't get connected to the internet
2007-07-09T07:12:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	 how are you getting to IRC? -- anyway -- are you familiar with IP addresses? can you check what address, if any, is configured on eth0?
2007-07-09T07:13:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	in the output it says inet addr: 169.254.7.222
2007-07-09T07:14:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	no, i am on a laptop beside the desktop that has ubuntu on it.
2007-07-09T07:14:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	 I may be too tired to make any sense. Sorry, I understand that you can't get to the Internet on that computer.
2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	it sounds as if the desktop computer isn't getting an address via dhcp. Is that how you would normally expect it to get an address?
2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	so isn't there some way to go in to the 'control panel'?
2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	i guess ...
2007-07-09T07:15:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	yes. System > Administration > Network
2007-07-09T07:18:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	donnaclarke	when you have opened up the 'Network Settings' dialog, you should see four tabs, the first is 'Connections' -- in that tab, highlight 'Wired connection' and click the 'Properties' button.
2007-07-09T07:19:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	k, trying to get it open
2007-07-09T07:20:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	yes
2007-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	i have network settings open; under 'connections' is blank
2007-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	donnaclarke	Nutubuntu	can i set up the network settings while i have you on the line, and then disconnect the laptop and connect the desktop?  i'm not gnna be able to get a routter before next payday
