2009-07-05T19:59:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	it says" python: can't open file '.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"
2009-07-05T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	what it the name of the file you want to run
2009-07-12T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	what is the package name
2009-07-12T18:24:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	its "[ubuntu.hamdi.web.id]-Mashup-MaXo1.1.tar.gz"
2009-07-12T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	that's not a package, thats a tar file
2009-07-12T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	if you untar it (think zip file) you'll normally find install instructions inside it in a README file
2009-07-12T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	it's quite important that's it's not a package so not "whatever" - if you don't think it matters, get on with installing it
2009-07-12T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	what ever
2009-07-12T18:27:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	it was a simple theme file. And don't use .zip thing. I hate Microsloth Windows
2009-07-12T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	how much you like/dislike microsoft windows has nothing to do with anything
2009-07-12T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	a lot of people have pulled it down
2009-07-12T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	sorry - not you
2009-07-12T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	it's not a zip file
2009-07-12T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	I told you what type of file it is and you said "what ever" so therefore - do your own research
2009-07-12T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	no I didn't
2009-07-12T18:30:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	hey you did!
2009-07-12T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	no, re-read what I said
2009-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	look here  [<ikonia> shivek: if you untar it (think zip file) you'll normally find install instructions inside it in a README file]
2009-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	the line before I told you it was a tar file
2009-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	shivek	ikonia	9think zip file) ??
2009-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	and to be exact it's a compressed tar file
2009-07-12T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	best of luck
2009-07-21T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	shivek	127.0.0.1 is a loop back address
