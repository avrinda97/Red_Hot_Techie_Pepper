2006-10-27T16:10:00.000Z	Stormx2		YAY edgy :)
2006-10-27T16:11:00.000Z	Stormx2		My dapper --> edgy upgrade went perfect, which is a first. My hoary --> breezy and breezy --> dapper upgrades killed it ;-)
2006-10-27T16:12:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 well, what is the command line syntax to upgrade?
2006-10-27T16:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	I used the upgrade tool, but I'm sure it is just a frontend for the command line stuff.
2006-10-27T16:13:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 where did you get it?  I don't want to loose the current install or settings that I've got
2006-10-27T16:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades. Its the first piece of code listed.
2006-10-27T16:14:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 thanks, I'll have a look
2006-10-27T16:19:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 it looks like the update servers are flooded.  This is taking for EVER!!
2006-10-27T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Hah! Nevermind ;)
2006-10-27T16:19:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 we're running a blazing 20K/sec here
2006-10-27T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	I did it yesterday to beat the rush. But remember, its got to download ~600mb
2006-10-27T16:20:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	I jsut hope it fits on this drive
2006-10-27T16:27:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 did you have an issue when you used the update manager?  I keep getting "update-manager: error: no such option: -c"
2006-10-27T16:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Yeah, I did. Try put a double -
2006-10-27T16:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	so --
2006-10-27T16:29:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 was that a dubble -- inside the ""?
2006-10-27T16:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Hold on.
2006-10-27T16:30:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 ok, thanks.  I'm @ work right now on break, so I can leave it plugged in and running in the back while I'm working.
2006-10-27T16:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	It should be right
2006-10-27T16:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Are you up to date with all your packages?
2006-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Just try the apt-get method
2006-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	It is probably a bit more informative...
2006-10-27T16:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	jeeves_Moss	Have you updated *all* your repos in your sources.list?
2006-10-27T16:37:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Stormx2	 I think I did
