2010-05-16T11:52:00.000Z	chouchou		hi all, by default, ubuntu is logging me with teh user i created, using Gnome, how do I login as Super user / root by default ?
2010-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	chouchou		ok, is there a way for Ubuntu to start with Shell by default so I can enter my root acccount there ?
2010-05-16T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 depends on the details - yes. several ways
2010-05-16T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 you may want to start over from the beginning and state the actual problem a bit more clearly. I think we may be offtrack
2010-05-16T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 it would be very odd that  running firefox as root could access the internet, but not a  user running firefox.
2010-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 by default theres the 'inital' user that has sudo rights. You re saying that account you made at install cant access the internet?
2010-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 this is wireless networking you are refering to?
2010-05-16T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 so if you login to the console as a user. can you do a 'ping 8.8.8.8' and see if it returns ping times?
2010-05-16T12:07:00.000Z	chouchou	Dr_Willis	Network unreacheable
2010-05-16T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 now do a 'sudo -i' to get to  a root shell (in the console) and try the same ping command.
2010-05-16T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 chedk the output of 'ifconfig' see if your wired nic has an actual inet addr:    for its ip#.
2010-05-16T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 vmware? You are trouble shooting a linux system thats not getting networking inside vmware you mean?
2010-05-16T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	  there really shouldent be any 'settings' in the root account to transfer
2010-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 vmware uses some sort of tunnling network device to get to the actual windows machine to get to the internet. so it may be a vmware setting issue
2010-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 if you dont want GDM to start. then disable the gdm service.
2010-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 gdm startiong shouldent be affecting the networking at all
2010-05-16T12:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 if you just want shell access  - you could just install the sshd on the ubuntu in vmware, and use putty from the windows machine to connect to it also.
2010-05-16T12:22:00.000Z	chouchou	Dr_Willis	 here is the result of my ifconfig Link encap:local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask 255.0.0.0 UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:12436 Metric:1           RX packets: 285 errors :0 dropped :0 overruns:0 frame:0   TX packets: 285 errors :0 dropped :0 overruns:0 carrier:0   collision:0 txqueuelen:0  RX bytes:22834 (22.8 KB)   TX bytes:22834 (22.8 KB)
2010-05-16T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 you dont even see info for a 'eth0' or 'eth0'
2010-05-16T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 like this.. ->
2010-05-16T12:34:00.000Z	chouchou	Dr_Willis	the command you sent to me, I was told that location is a directory
2010-05-16T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	clarify 'have a web installed'
2011-02-05T20:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 webmin is not really supported under ubuntu. thers alternatives
2011-02-05T20:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chouchou	 best to learn to do tings via ssh. :_)
