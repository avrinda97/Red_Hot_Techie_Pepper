2009-12-10T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	you don't launch sshd like that
2009-12-10T18:10:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	I know.
2009-12-10T18:10:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	sshd is started via /etc/init.d/ssh start
2009-12-10T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	sorry, I missunderstood what you where saying, I though you where saying that's how you where trying to start it
2009-12-10T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	I've not seen a log
2009-12-10T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	wat is your problem ?
2009-12-10T18:16:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/d6e957d40
2009-12-10T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	can you pastebin your /etc/ssh/sshd_config please
2009-12-10T18:20:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	erUSUL, it seems it only does that on a non-default port, works just fine on 22, however, if I modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config Port=5522 .. won't work
2009-12-10T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	it looks like it's trying to connect on ipv6
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	no problem 'bout that .. it's localhost ..
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	disable the ubuntu firewall for starters while debugging
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	no firewall
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	it's localhost on ipv6 - the firewall rules may not be blocking it
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	have you disabled the default iptables firewall ?
2009-12-10T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	BlackBishop	try ssh 127.0.0.1 -vv -p 5522
2009-12-10T18:23:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	erUSUL http://pastebin.com/d9d46d92
2009-12-10T18:32:00.000Z	BlackBishop	ikonia	however, setting "Port 22" in sshd_config works just great ! :|
