2010-03-11T05:46:00.000Z	Coppered		Does Ubuntu come with an email client preinstalled?
2010-03-11T05:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	yes, it does.
2010-03-11T05:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	and there are several others to choose from in the repo's.  I think gnome still uses evolution.
2010-03-11T05:47:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	i prefer thunderbird from mozilla.
2010-03-11T05:50:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	thunderbird is probably going to be the best-recommended client
2010-03-11T06:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	you may want to make a separate partition for /home, but that's all i recommend.
2010-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	making a separate partition for /home just makes it easy to upgrade
2010-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	you can wipe your main partition that has all your installs, but keep all your personal files and some configuration.
2010-03-11T06:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	no you can upgrade easily, but to do a clean wipe - just makes it easier to have a separate /home.  not required by any means.
2010-03-11T06:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	you will have a /home, trust me :D
2010-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	you can add stuff to the repo's
2010-03-11T07:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	the coolest thing about ubuntu and linux in general?  for the most part, you don't have to go and download the latest firefox!
2010-03-11T07:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	or anything else for that matter.  the repos keep every package updated.
2010-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	there's like a 28,000 some package repo that ubuntu connects to by default.
2010-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	don't forget, google is your friend :D
2010-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	there's a couple of ways.  you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list, or the "gui" way thru synaptic
2010-03-11T07:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	ubuntu comes pre-loaded with repo's.  it's where you get all your updates - but unlike windows which just updates windows, ubuntu (and linux) updates all come thru the repo's - so all packages you have installed and the OS get updated.
2010-03-11T07:10:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Coppered	he's saying firefox is included with ubuntu... just like evolution.
