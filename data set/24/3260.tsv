2009-12-12T23:02:00.000Z	SRabbelier		I'm wanting to install Windows next to my Debian install, will I be able to use the Ubuntu 9.10 live cd to restore grub 2 (as per https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling GRUB 2), I'd assume it doesn't matter whether I'd use Debians or Ubuntu's 'update-grub' and 'grub-install'?
2009-12-12T23:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 is devian using grub2 or grub1 ? thats a big differance
2009-12-12T23:03:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	I'm on Debian's testing, which uses grub2
2009-12-12T23:06:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	so, mh, did you mean that if it's using grub2 it will probably be allright?
2009-12-12T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 should be. but im not sure how different grub2 is on the various disrtos.  Theres a lot of work on grub2 going on. so  there may be version differances.
2009-12-12T23:07:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	would there be any way to sortof do a 'dry' test?
2009-12-12T23:07:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	(before I go ahead and install windows and blow up my MBR)
2009-12-12T23:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 Try it and see I guess..  It pays to learn how to use grub and repair it. :)
2009-12-12T23:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 with most 'repair' operations you could boot a live cd and chroot into the installed system. that way its using the proper grub files for that disrto
2009-12-12T23:09:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	ah, mhh,  "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling GRUB 2" recommends to use the Ubuntu binaries, it'd make sense to not honour that step and instead make sure to use the binaries from my Deiban install
2009-12-12T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 yep. Unless of course you are testing out some new features of grub2
2009-12-12T23:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 the ubuntu grub2 dosent support LUA for example. or some other 'in progress' features.
2009-12-12T23:10:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	nope, nothing in particular
2009-12-12T23:10:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	the only reason I'm using grub2 is because aptitude told me it had a fancy new shineh package ready for me :P
2009-12-12T23:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 im not sure if debian uses a similer config files for its grub2 either. Ubuntu has /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d     No idea what debian uses
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 grub2 has some really really really neat features. I got a flash drive with grub2 setup to boot my ubuntu.iso file :)
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	*nod*, it shouldn't matter if using my install's grub binaries though, no?
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 i then did changes to my ubuntu's grub2 configs where i can also boot an iso file from the hard drive as a 'recovery'  option
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 i wouldent think so
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	yeah, I'm glad to see linux is moving forward with the whole grub thing
2009-12-12T23:11:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	neat
2009-12-12T23:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SRabbelier	 progress... gotta love it.. gotta hate it...
2009-12-12T23:13:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	hehe, I don't mind it much, the progress that is, I'm hoping things will get more intuitive
2009-12-12T23:27:00.000Z	SRabbelier	Dr_Willis	looks like it works, at least the "grub-install --recheck /dev/sda" part worked fine!
