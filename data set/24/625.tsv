2011-06-17T07:39:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	in what applications?
2011-06-17T07:40:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	nevermind if /dev/video0 doesn't exist nothing should work
2011-06-17T07:40:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	i've tried with cheese and in the multimedia systems selector under system > admin
2011-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	do you know what kind of camera this is? lsusb to find it
2011-06-17T07:47:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	i'm not sure which one it is...
2011-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/628257/
2011-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	there is no camera there unless it is 0db0:3801 but i think that is bluetooth. this is an integrated camera?
2011-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	yes that was everything from lsusb, i don't think it detects it at all
2011-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	maybe its not usb (which is odd but possible) try lspci
2011-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	you could also try lshw
2011-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	what model is this system
2011-06-17T07:53:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	uh zareason
2011-06-17T07:53:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	i can't find a camera in either of those
2011-06-17T07:58:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	well val aurora apparently like zareason so thats a plus. not sure what the deal with your camera is. you might try emailing them, or booting an older livecd that does work and seeing if you can identify the camera model in it
2011-06-17T08:01:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	it says its an intel webcam when i look up my computer online
2011-06-17T08:01:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	didn't know intel even made webcams
2011-06-17T08:02:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	can you tell if it is supposed to be usb or what
2011-06-17T08:05:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	well if it used to work with gstreamer, does that mean that it would be usb?
2011-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	or am i just completely wrong
2011-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	doesn't mean much that it used to work with gstreamer. could be anything really. most webcams are usb (its a bus that is reasonably widely available and has the necessary throughput, and wasting a pci slot is unnecessary)
2011-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	well it's this computer if that helps at all > http://zareason.com/shop/Alto-1454.html
2011-06-17T08:09:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	yeah it doesn't really say enough about the hardware. i would (a) see if it works after a complete shutdown (and wait 5 seconds before rebooting), (b) if you can determine the type and driver that used to work, (c) email zareason/try their forums
2011-06-17T08:09:00.000Z	escott	courtney_	without being able to identify the device its hard to make any progress
2011-06-17T08:10:00.000Z	courtney_	escott	okay thanks ^^
