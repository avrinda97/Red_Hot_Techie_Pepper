2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		Ubuntu or Gnome?
2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		when I remove .gnome2 I can
2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		who's to blame?
2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		Ubuntu or Gnome?
2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		sorry
2006-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		I get really tired of that
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		nope
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		I removed .gnome2 from my home dir
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		and it works
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK		but I think it stinks
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	so something in .gnome2 is corrupted
2006-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	yes
2006-08-07T13:43:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	do you know specifically what, yet?
2006-08-07T13:43:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	not yet sorry
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	besides checking error logs, you can cut out pieces of .gnome2 until it stops breaking.  I use kde
2006-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	I will do that
2006-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	I still have gnome on two ubuntu boxes and I've not seen a problem with it.
2006-08-07T13:49:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	that doesn't explain why it doesn't work here
2006-08-07T13:49:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	indeed, it does not.  I meant, though, that you shouldn't give up on gnome.
2006-08-07T13:49:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	ok, maybe I am just being unlucky
2006-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	Possibly just you are doing something atypical.
2006-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	sometimes computers are just frustrating
2006-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	sethk	cs_DK_DK	I would start by listing the contents of .gnome2 in modification date order, to see what changed most recently.  I have to go for a bit.  I'll tell you how to do that when I return (if you don't already know)
2006-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	cs_DK_DK	sethk	ok
