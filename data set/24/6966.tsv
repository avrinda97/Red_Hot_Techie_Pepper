2005-10-28T09:36:00.000Z	dooglus		anyone know how to run a job on a daily basis using anacron?
2005-10-28T09:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	crontab -e  ?
2005-10-28T09:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	the problem with cron is if your machine is down when the specified time comes, the job doesn't run.  and it doesn't run when you boot it either.
2005-10-28T09:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	with anacron, the job runs once a day even if your machine is down at the specified time
2005-11-02T08:17:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	Mark Shuttleworth calls it a spoon, not a fork
2005-11-15T10:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	I use shorewall -- done :-)
2005-11-15T10:04:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	does shorewall allow you to route packets from one subnet to another for a particular port?
2005-11-15T10:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	I have no idea - it has advanced features - and also good documentation :-)
2005-11-15T10:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	content, not form :-)
2005-11-15T10:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	gah, I see what you mean - that is not it ;-)
2005-12-01T11:05:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	see the little row of horizontal lines just to the left of the window list at the bottom of the screen?  right-click it and say preferences.  you can then tick 'show windows from all workspaces'
2005-12-01T11:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	checking...
2005-12-01T11:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	thanks for that tip.  It works for me, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for (I'd like to have the task bar list only apps in a given workspace, then be able to invoke separately a complete list of all apps, as in xfce4 or wmaker middle-click)
2005-12-01T11:28:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	there's a 'window list' app or something which you can 'add to panel' after right-clicking on a bit of empty panel.  i don't use it, but it might be what you want
2005-12-01T11:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	thanks again for your tip; I will double-check on that
2005-12-01T11:35:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	it's called "Window Selector", not "Window List"
2005-12-01T12:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	'window-selector' is the right idea - thanks again.  It would be nice if it identified the workspace numbers also, but this is 'good enough' :-)
2005-12-01T12:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	good :)
2005-12-28T09:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	haha
2006-01-25T08:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	those services aren't network services, but they run by default
2006-01-25T08:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	yeah, my terminology is not the best ATM
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	nifty :-)
2006-06-09T05:25:00.000Z	dooglus	Xenguy	the nice thing about piping to 'while read x' is that it works on files with spaces in their names
2006-06-09T05:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	dooglus	hrm, really
