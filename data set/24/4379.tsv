2007-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	Ambience		Okay, I have an Atheros card.  7.04 detects it and I'm able to configure it, but no matter what settings I put in - even when the key and password, excryption type, etc are all correct - it fails to connect.  I'm wondering if my router is the issue...are there any known issues with the DGL-4300 GamerLounge routers?
2007-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	Ambience		I have static IPs set and DHCP already turned off, plus ports forwarded to set IPs for every PC in the house, so yes.
