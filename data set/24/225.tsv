2012-11-04T20:07:00.000Z	phong_		can someone tell me how to upgrade ubuntu to lastest version?
2012-11-04T20:07:00.000Z	phong_		i'm using 12.04lts
2012-11-04T20:07:00.000Z	phong_		i think the latest is 12.10
2012-11-04T20:07:00.000Z	L3top	phong_	what are you trying to get out of upgrading, out of curiosity?
2012-11-04T20:08:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	i dont know , base on my thinking, latest always good isin't it/
2012-11-04T20:08:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	maybe something news add on?
2012-11-04T20:08:00.000Z	phong_		well...how to upgrade
2012-11-04T20:09:00.000Z	L3top	phong_	No. Stable is always good. The latest bleeding edge release is not "always" good. Moving from LTS to latest is not clever imho, unless something you have isn't working and you need support for brand new hw that is not avail in LTS... but that is my opinion.
2012-11-04T20:10:00.000Z	phong_		so no upgrade?
2012-11-04T20:11:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	i have image the current one
2012-11-04T20:11:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	i still love to try out though
2012-11-04T20:11:00.000Z	phong_		how come i dont see upgrade to 12.010
2012-11-04T20:11:00.000Z	phong_		it said ur system is up to date
2012-11-04T20:16:00.000Z	L3top		phong if you just want to try it, install a virtual machine and load in there inside your stable install.
2012-11-04T20:17:00.000Z	L3top	phong_	upgrading is a one way ticket.
2012-11-04T20:20:00.000Z	L3top		find ./* -iname uncompressed.js -exec echo "rm {}" /;          remove the echo and quotes to execute. That will just tell you what it is going to do as it sits.
2012-11-04T20:20:00.000Z	L3top		er... dont need that *
2012-11-04T20:23:00.000Z	L3top		I did -exec rm because when I am blowing things up, I like an echo first to make sure I didn't do something stupid.
2012-11-04T20:45:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	i'm in progress of updating now
2012-11-04T20:45:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	hope nothing blow up
2012-11-04T20:46:00.000Z	phong_		is red-hat differ from ubuntu?
2012-11-04T20:46:00.000Z	phong_		i know both are linux os
2012-11-04T20:49:00.000Z	L3top	phong_	Yes... they are different animals. Ubuntu uses the debian packaging manager(dpkg) and redhat uses the redhat package manager (RPM). This is the fundamental difference which sets the other differences in motion.
2012-11-04T20:49:00.000Z	phong_	L3top	and which is better?
