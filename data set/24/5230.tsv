2007-01-03T12:10:00.000Z	bieb		I hate dialup.......
2007-01-03T12:12:00.000Z	bieb		here is the issue I am having... I converted my father over to Ubuntu, I am trying to configure his modem for dialup connection. I have downloaded and installed sl-modem-daemon, but wvdial keeps failing
2007-01-03T12:12:00.000Z	bieb		I have had no luck with gnome-ppp either
2007-01-03T12:13:00.000Z	bieb		Stefg, that is where I got the info for sl-modem-dialup
2007-01-03T12:13:00.000Z	bieb		sl-modem-daemon I mean
2007-01-03T12:14:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	try the -386 kernel and -386 restricted packages... My laptops internal ltmodem works with -386, but fails with -generic
2007-01-03T12:15:00.000Z	bieb	stefg	I installed 6.05
2007-01-03T12:16:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	wjhat does uname -r tell you?
2007-01-03T12:17:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	ok... so you have linux-restricted-modules-386 installed?
2007-01-03T12:18:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386
2007-01-03T12:20:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	so the slmodem daemon is run at bootup? Is /dev/modem created?
2007-01-03T12:23:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	ok, so the common stuff is checked... since ltmodem runs nicely out of the box with 386-kernels i never had to troubleshoot..
2007-01-03T14:11:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	I can't really answer that, but my first check would be if the DNS is set correctly? /etc/resolv.conf has a tendency to get overwritten in ubuntu :-\
2007-01-03T14:36:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	i'd have a close look at www.linmodems.org
2007-09-28T10:46:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	#vmware ?
2007-11-20T20:45:00.000Z	bieb	stefg	I had looked there.. the Presario at Circuit City is not listed. Thats why I figured if anyone else has been looking at them or already owns one
2007-11-20T20:46:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	waht you really need to know is the chipset/motherboard and graphics chip.
2007-11-20T20:46:00.000Z	bieb	stefg	wireless card also?
2007-11-20T20:46:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	right.
2007-11-20T20:48:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	so intel and nvidia chipsets do usually give the least problems, while Ati drivers suck (yet), and exotic mobo chipsets might give you acpi trouble (suspend not working, nboot trouble)
2007-11-20T20:48:00.000Z	bieb	stefg	 I will stay away from ATI
2007-11-20T20:50:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	cpu isn't the problem, it's the mobo chipset. so my favourite Combo is AMD/nforce/nvidia , but intel-cpu/intel-chipset/intel-graphics works well, too
2007-11-20T20:51:00.000Z	bieb	stefg	 thanks for that info
2008-01-19T02:16:00.000Z	stefg	bieb	you can't. that's ROM, faked as a CD where the vendor usually puts some crypto programs
