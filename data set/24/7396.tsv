2004-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	for a server I wouldnt use a GUI
2004-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	but if you choose to you could use, remote X (over ssl), VNC (over ssl) as 2 options
2004-12-26T08:36:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	I'm still learning and want to have the back up in case I need to do anything with it
2004-12-26T08:37:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	look at the apt manual pages and apt documentation
2004-12-26T08:37:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	but running X on a server is generally a bad idea
2004-12-26T08:38:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	Why is that? Performance? or security?
2004-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	both
2004-12-26T08:44:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	I know, but this isn't a high profile machine. More or less for me to get familiar with everything and figure it out. it will be my first server and it will just have my little homesite as its only page.
2004-12-26T08:44:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	yeh thats cool, just warning you though mate

2004-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	Thanks I will look through that. Just so I know alittle going into it. Is that so I can run command line on the server and use gui on another machine I am at?
2004-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	you can run the graphical part of a program locally, ie.. all the controls, but the code of it runs on the server
2004-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	Okay okay, that sounds very good. And is a good fit for what I'm looking for. Thank you.
2004-12-26T08:49:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	np :)
2004-12-26T10:06:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	try user:admin and a blank pass
2004-12-26T10:08:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	Nope that didn't work. I'm scared now, because I try again...it will lock me out. And I have no idea how to fix that. i have had to uninstall and reinstall it each time it has done that.
2004-12-26T10:08:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	lol, that can be fixed, you can reset the admin pass though, hang on I'll get the details
2004-12-26T10:09:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	it tells me the password file is /etc/webmin/miniserv.users and when I go into that the only line is root:*
2004-12-26T10:09:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	login as root with a blan password then
2004-12-26T10:10:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	http://www.webmin.com/faq.html
2004-12-26T10:12:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	You are awesome. Sorry that I am a little slow on this stuff. Not new to computers...just new to a lot of this linux stuff.
2004-12-26T10:12:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	not a prob, thats what channels like this are here for :-)
2004-12-26T10:22:00.000Z	Tyche	zeedo	I know, but I wish I could give some feedback a little at least. That worked though and I am in now.
2004-12-26T10:22:00.000Z	zeedo	Tyche	nice :)
