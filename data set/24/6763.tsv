2005-07-24T15:41:00.000Z	Antinomy		oh, well, that was my FIRST question, I guess you've answered it
2005-07-24T15:41:00.000Z	Antinomy		:)
2005-07-24T15:41:00.000Z	Antinomy		but lessee
2005-07-24T15:41:00.000Z	Antinomy		ok, how do I install a media player on ubuntu that can play a wide variety of formats?
2005-07-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antinomy		What is that, an application?
2005-07-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antinomy		I'm a super noob
2005-07-24T15:42:00.000Z	Antinomy		Ubuntu guide doesnt help. Sorry.
2005-07-24T15:43:00.000Z	Antinomy		and the link you gave, Hrdwr, is not taking me anywhere
2005-07-24T15:43:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	explain which bit of that page you don't understand, then.
2005-07-24T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	so, you're being uselessly vague.  which text didn't exist?  which exact section were you reading?
2005-07-24T15:45:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	then you typed in the wrong url.  wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-07-24T15:48:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	a repository is a set of packages.  universe is a set of Free Software packages, multiverse is a set of random other ones.
2005-07-24T15:49:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	sort of
2005-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	windows can't natively do anything with linux parttions, aside from formatting them
2005-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	ok
2005-07-27T05:22:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	define "freezes"
2005-07-27T05:23:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	I see the splash screen and the login box for user name. cursor flashes in there, but no input is accepted. THen cursor stops flashing. then after 5 minutes, the screen blanks out. the mouse pointer never moves throughout
2005-07-27T05:23:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	loading from grub
2005-07-27T05:23:00.000Z	bob2	Antinomy	does wiggling the mouse or hitting the kyboard wake up the monitor?
2005-07-27T05:24:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	no
2005-07-27T05:24:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	touchpad
2005-07-27T05:48:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	well, I'm installing ubuntu because windows sucks.
2005-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	Antinomy	bob2	 But I may have to reevaluate the relative merits. A working computer is sort of essential
