2007-12-25T00:10:00.000Z	SunmanXII		soo anyone? video card problems for ati... inverted colors in mplayer. maybe a xorg.conf problem
2007-12-25T00:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	Only in that one program would most likely not be ati or xorg problem
2007-12-25T00:11:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	actually, vlc is screwed up as well. and it started happening after i messed up with xorg.conf
2007-12-25T00:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	post your xorg so people can check it out
2007-12-25T00:13:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49489/
2007-12-25T00:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	Did you edit it manually, or did you use sudo dpkg etc..
2007-12-25T00:16:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	i used sudo dpkg...does it look like i edited it manually?
2007-12-25T00:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	look in the xorg folder for your backup and compare them or replace the existing with your old one
2007-12-25T00:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	No it looks like it was edited with dpkg and no res are listed at all.
2007-12-25T00:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	look in etc/X11 and look for an xorg followed by a bunch of numbers.. that will be the automatic backup
2007-12-25T00:20:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	I looked in xorg.conf.original-0 and it had the driver name ("ati" which is the proprietary driver which i dled) under the video card. its not in my current xorg.conf. is that the problem?
2007-12-25T00:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	make a backup of your current.. replace with your old and see if it solves the prob.. if so.. merge the two with what you need
2007-12-25T00:22:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	ok. im gonna restart x now and see if it works
2007-12-25T00:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	good luck
2007-12-25T00:30:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	so it did exactly the same thing that it did last time i tried to change xorg.conf. it disabled my proprietary driver which i downloaded for my ATI card and went into failsafe mode.
2007-12-25T00:30:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	I know that if i ineable the driver it will work fine, but the video problem will stay
2007-12-25T00:50:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	still here?
2007-12-25T00:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	not really
2007-12-25T00:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	Yes, I am here, just waiting for neice to deliver her baby
2007-12-25T00:52:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	haha sorry if im distracting you or anything. so, any ideas?
2007-12-25T00:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	that was the xorg ati card video color problem?
2007-12-25T00:54:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	yes, im the one with the ATI xorg.conf problem
2007-12-25T00:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SunmanXII	Ask wols.. but I would reinstall the restriced drivers...
2007-12-25T00:55:00.000Z	SunmanXII	Jack_Sparrow	i tried reverting to an old xorg.conf, but it did the same thing that it did last time i tried changing xorg.conf - it disabled my ATI driver and went into failsafe mode
