2011-11-15T01:23:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		anyone gotten ubuntu to work with a built in webcam?
2011-11-15T01:23:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	works perfectly on my laptop
2011-11-15T01:23:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	do you have cheese installed?
2011-11-15T01:23:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		hmm, mine doesn't work. yes i have cheese installed.
2011-11-15T01:24:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	your webcam should be in /dev/video0 ... do you have that file?
2011-11-15T01:25:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		yeah, it's there sandertje
2011-11-15T01:26:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	if you go to cheese, edit->preferences... what does it say at device?
2011-11-15T01:27:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		it's greyed out actually; not selectable
2011-11-15T01:27:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	same here, but does it say anything.... something like 'integrated laptop webcam' or along those lines?
2011-11-15T01:28:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		no, it doesn't
2011-11-15T01:29:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		i'm thinking perhaps it has something to do with my video drivers but i'm not sure. the propietary drivers aren't installed.
2011-11-15T01:29:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		for my ATI HD 5730 Radeon
2011-11-15T01:30:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	that shouldn't matter.....
2011-11-15T01:31:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		that's weird, it shows in dev folder but not in cheese
2011-11-15T01:31:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam/Troubleshooting#Picture_is_Dark
2011-11-15T01:32:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl	sandertje	i don't know if this was a mistake , but i swear i saw video0. now theres no video0. only video1
2011-11-15T01:33:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		ok, ill check it out
2011-11-15T01:33:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	ah, that could be it..... you could try that step....
2011-11-15T01:36:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		interesting, "unable to unopen device; check too see if device is connected" ... maybe a hardware issue
2011-11-15T01:37:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	kinda sounds that ubuntu is not recognizing the webcan, yeah.
2011-11-15T01:39:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		yeah; i've read that people have been able to get this particular model to work though & that the only problem is an upside down picture. maybe its damaged or something
2011-11-15T01:39:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		windows 7 gets an error message for the webcam "this device is already being used"
2011-11-15T01:40:00.000Z	jboyjetgrl		oh well, i'm just passed warranty too :P
2011-11-15T01:40:00.000Z	sandertje	jboyjetgrl	i'm sorry, but that really sounds like there's a hardware problem... if you experience it on both OSes
