2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu		I'm not sure.

2006-06-04T05:02:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	is  the netinstall iso considered to be an alternate CD ?
2006-06-04T05:00:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	no.
2006-06-04T05:00:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	you have to use the Alternate CD to do LVM.
2006-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	in fact I am already in LVM. what I want is just to install to another LVM logical volume.
2006-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	you have to use the Alternate CD.
2006-06-04T05:02:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	no.
2006-06-04T05:02:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	I said /the/ Alternate CD.
2006-06-04T05:02:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	although it would work.
2006-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	ok, that's what I wanted to be sure. the net installer is like the alternate CD without anypackage on it I guess
2006-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	yep.
2006-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	I wanted to know if there is a way to run the installer script that is on the alternate install CD but from a running distro
2006-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	no.
2006-06-04T05:05:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	I can't get that script ?
2006-06-04T05:05:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	Ubuntu isn't designed to be installed from within another OS, although it can be done with a fair bit of hacking.
2006-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	I tried running the installer from qemu, but that's a bit ugly to do that :D
2006-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	why can't you boot off the CD/floppy?
2006-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	well that's like asking why I don't run windows  ;)
2006-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	mirak	Fujitsu	that's just for the pleasure to do it in a particular way
2006-06-04T06:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	mirak	xargs is your friend.
