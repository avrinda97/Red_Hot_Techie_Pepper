2005-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	changed screens? what do you mean? did you change a config file?
2005-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	Stew2, that would be it
2005-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	go to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for Section "Screen"
2005-06-18T15:47:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	look under the sections that say: mode "1024x760" ...  and add in the resolutions of your monitor in the format "<horiz>x<vert>" "<horiz>x<vert>"
2005-06-18T15:48:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	careful not to type out full nicks unless you get them right - use tab - otherwise irc clients won't highlight your responces / questions properly
2005-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	you may have to restart X in order to get it to recognize your new settings.  also - have you tried using the quick keys to get to a usable screen size?
2005-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	<ctrl><alt><shift> <keypad +> OR <keypad ->
2005-06-18T15:52:00.000Z	afroman	xolotl_	the thing is that I don\t know what rate to use
2005-06-18T15:54:00.000Z	afroman	xolotl_	the thing is that I don\t know what rate to use
2005-06-18T15:55:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	that's a matter for research then - gotta find out what monitor you have and what it's specs are
2005-06-18T15:56:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	or you could run xorgconfig
2005-06-18T15:58:00.000Z	afroman	xolotl_	can U help me find my monitor resolution, I have a compaq presario v510
2005-06-18T15:59:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	did you try xorgconfig and look for your monitor in there?
2005-06-18T15:59:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	hmm - the monitor - you need the model and make of the monitor
2005-06-19T16:00:00.000Z	afroman	xolotl_	as I said it is a Compaq Presario v510, although I dunno wot the rates are
2005-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	try a google search - those numbers have gotta be around somewhere - I'll take a look in a second too
2005-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	xolotl_	afroman	tried searching the compaq.com website?
