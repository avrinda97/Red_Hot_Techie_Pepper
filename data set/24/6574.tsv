2005-09-21T15:23:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	that's not what samba does
2005-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	i see. what package will i need to do that kind of thing?
2005-09-21T15:25:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	smbfs
2005-09-21T15:26:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	ok..i'll wait for apt-get dist-upgrade to free up synaptic, then i'll check if i got that package installed. thanks!
2005-09-25T09:34:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	just use mplayer
2005-09-25T09:34:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	that's not on the default package listing right?
2005-09-25T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	indeed, it's in multiverse. /msg ubotu repositories

2005-09-25T09:44:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	thanks for the help. got to go
2005-09-25T11:09:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	i got mplayer and only got to try it out on the CLI..how is the GUI made?
2005-09-25T11:10:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	gmplayer, I guess
2005-09-25T11:11:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	ah so mplayer is meant to run on a terminal? that's fine with me
2005-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	if you want to
2005-10-01T08:45:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	ubuntu seems to have pre-classified all true type fonts into corresponding directories, unlike windows, whch places all of them in one
2005-10-01T08:45:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	yeah, doesn't really matter, tho
2005-10-01T08:46:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	great..thanks again!
2005-10-01T08:46:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	~/.fonts/ is simplest if you habve only a single user
2005-10-01T08:48:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	ok i don't have ~/.fonts yet, so i'll just mkdir one?
2005-10-01T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	trigger_ph	yes
2005-10-01T08:51:00.000Z	trigger_ph	bob2	thanks. i'm importing now, will let u know the moment gimp sees them. :)
