2010-05-11T08:17:00.000Z	EntityReborn		thanks.
2010-05-11T08:18:00.000Z	EntityReborn		The standard CD I mean
2010-05-11T08:20:00.000Z	EntityReborn		"jken418, and the livecd doesn't have any hidden options for this?" (choose which packages to install)
2010-05-11T08:21:00.000Z	EntityReborn		Ok, maybe I'm misunderstanding something... LVM is the harddrive setup, correct?
2010-05-11T08:21:00.000Z	EntityReborn		I'm talkinjg about packages, ie xchat, totem, gnome
2010-05-11T08:21:00.000Z	EntityReborn		RIght, I knew that.
2010-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	EntityReborn		My god you guys.
2010-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	EntityReborn		I'm NOT INTERESTED IN LVM! :P
2010-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	EntityReborn		xD
2010-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	EntityReborn		Hilarous
2010-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	some people misread or miss your actual question and assume the answer ;)
2010-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	 yeah, I see that .
2010-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	you want to install extra packages on an install?
2010-05-11T08:24:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	more like a custom install.
2010-05-11T08:24:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	but not hardcoded to the CD :P
2010-05-11T08:24:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	exactly
2010-05-11T08:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	maybe just have a secondary repo cd?
2010-05-11T08:25:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	@_@ you can do that?
2010-05-11T08:26:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	i think i've read something about that in the past... you can have your own apt cds, so should be able to do something like that
2010-05-11T08:26:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	might be able to just have packages stored (added after remaster) in the same directories as the rest?
2010-05-11T08:27:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	if it's usb, make one partition a remaster and another a repository?
2010-05-11T08:28:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	my USB boots ISOs directly
2010-05-11T08:28:00.000Z	Out_Cold	EntityReborn	which ever way to the solution ;)
2010-05-11T08:34:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Out_Cold	exactly
