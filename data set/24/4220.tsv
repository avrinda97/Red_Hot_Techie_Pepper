2008-10-20T21:08:00.000Z	Decepticon	cabrioleur	i am on a different network on a different computer right now
2008-10-20T21:08:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Decepticon	it looks like your computer is o.k. Do you have any opportunity to connect different computer to your net adapter? It looks like ISP problem.

2008-10-20T21:10:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Decepticon	have you checked if your IPv6 is enabled? Sometimes it's causing problems.
2008-10-20T21:11:00.000Z	Decepticon	cabrioleur	in ifconfig -a, i can see inet6 addr: fe80::206:5bff:fea4:c5c3/64
2008-10-20T21:50:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Decepticon	did you try vesa drivers?

2008-10-20T21:50:00.000Z	Decepticon	cabrioleur	how do i tell it to use vesa drivers
2008-10-20T21:52:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Decepticon	first you have to make backup "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup1"
2008-10-20T21:53:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Decepticon	now, "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
