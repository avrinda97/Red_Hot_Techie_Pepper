2010-02-08T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 Huh?
2010-02-08T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	  so you are using a version of ubuntu thats almost 2 years old.
2010-02-08T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 just because its older. dosent really mean its 'better' for a low end system
2010-02-08T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 there are disrtros out there with a focus on low end/old systems
2010-02-08T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 you could always use  just a window manager... that will bne lighter and faster.  the xubuntu even.  but more limited
2010-02-08T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 you might want to check out the  lubuntu-desktop its supposed to be about as light as one can get. but its not got its own cd/disrto yet. You install some ubuntu, then install the lubuntu-desktop package
2010-02-08T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 you can set that up if you wanted to
2010-02-08T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 its not big.. your pc is just old... :)
2010-02-08T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 thers rich then theres stingy...
2010-02-08T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 xchat is an IRC client
2010-02-09T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 compiz is installed by default
2010-02-09T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 if you got the drivers enabled properly 'compiz --replace'
2010-02-09T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 or install/use the fusion-icon tool
2010-02-09T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	farizluqman	 i doubt it.
