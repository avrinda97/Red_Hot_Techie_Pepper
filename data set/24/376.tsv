2011-11-27T00:16:00.000Z	Lehthanis		I need to download a driver for an ati sapphire x1650 on a laptop that doesn't have that video card in it...so I can install it in a computer that has no internet access.
2011-11-27T00:18:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	AMD/ATI has driver dropped support for pre-HD2000 cards long ago.
2011-11-27T00:20:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	The pre-HD2000s are supported only by the open source driver ("radeon"). For further support you might want to use the dedicated #radeon channel.
2011-11-27T00:20:00.000Z	Lehthanis	Galvatron	I just need any driver that will work...even if its the open source drivers...will ubuntu recognize it if I plug that video card in without putting it on the internet?
2011-11-27T00:21:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	Yes, because the open spurce drivers are already a part of the system.
2011-11-27T00:21:00.000Z	Lehthanis		will the system driver allow me to get a resolution above 1024x768?  Because the Geforce 4 thats in it, I have a hard time doing that....thats why I scavenged this video card, lol
2011-11-27T00:22:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	It should, but you won't know untill you try.
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	Lehthanis		gotcha....do I need to do anything with the system before I put the new video card in?  like disable the onboard video card?
2011-11-27T00:23:00.000Z	Lehthanis		that sounds promising.  I hope it ends up beign that easy
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	Lehthanis		I do have a tougher question...
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	Lehthanis		is there a way to get routine updates to an offline computer?
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	It might be a good idea. Anyways, what's this onboard card?
2011-11-27T00:24:00.000Z	Lehthanis		the onboard card is a geforce 4 mx and I can't get the video to stay right
2011-11-27T00:25:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	The only good think I can think about is connecting it to web, from time to time.
2011-11-27T00:25:00.000Z	Lehthanis		yeah, I thought about that...its really a pain to get it out of the church though, lol
2011-11-27T00:26:00.000Z	Lehthanis		I've used aptoncd to get software to it, but never updates...
2011-11-27T00:28:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	Switching to Radeon, especialy pre-HD2000, is not a really good idea either, since it's a real russian roulette.
2011-11-27T00:30:00.000Z	Lehthanis		well, the church can't really afford a new machine right now.
2011-11-27T00:31:00.000Z	Lehthanis		we dont really have much of a choice...I have to get something working better.
2011-11-27T00:31:00.000Z	Lehthanis		the geforce 4 screen is all off...it only detects 1024x768 and even that is offset with a weird wrapping effect on the edges of the screen
2011-11-27T00:31:00.000Z	Lehthanis		and the cursor doesn't line up.
2011-11-27T00:31:00.000Z	Lehthanis		I've tried adding modelines, and they don't work on bootup
2011-11-27T00:32:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	Radeons are famous for not working very well under X.org, due to problematic drivers (both open source and proprietary). I it's an AGP board, something like 7300GT + proprietary nVidia drivers would be a much better choice, since nVidia's famous for working very well with X.
2011-11-27T00:32:00.000Z	Galvatron	Lehthanis	For this X1650 best go to the #radeon channel
