2006-05-11T15:23:00.000Z	mythica		hi guys
2006-05-11T15:23:00.000Z	mythica		I am having some weird issues with my Xserver
2006-05-11T15:23:00.000Z	mythica		_X11TransSocketINETConnect() can't get address for localmachine:6000: Name or service not known
2006-05-11T15:23:00.000Z	mythica		can someone offer me some advice?
2006-05-11T15:24:00.000Z	mythica		ok
2006-05-11T15:25:00.000Z	mythica		127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost mythicness
2006-05-11T15:25:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	hmm, if this is something you're typing in, you should use 'localhost' instead of 'localmachine'
2006-05-11T15:25:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	ok, but i cant even add hosts using xhost:
2006-05-11T15:26:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	adding that line to hosts is a bit of a hack, but it's the quickest way to fix it
2006-05-11T15:27:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	I can imagine that'll fix it, yes
2006-05-11T15:27:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	k lemme try
2006-05-11T15:28:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	it's complaining it can't resolve 'localmachine', not sure why, but then I'm not sure what you're doing :)
2006-05-11T15:33:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	Thanks man
2006-05-11T15:33:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	np's man :)
2006-05-12T05:30:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	U there?
2006-05-12T05:30:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	I am having these X problems again, after I rebooted
2006-05-12T05:30:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	I thought that might happen, to fix it temporarily you just need to type in "export DISPLAY=:0"
2006-05-12T05:31:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	but I'd search your .bashrc and .bash_profile files for export DISPLAY= lines, and replace them with "export DISPLAY=:0"
2006-05-12T05:31:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	I tried that, no go
2006-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	Generates: Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server  &  Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key  &  xhost:  unable to open display ":0"
2006-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	you need to do 'xhost +' as yourself first then :)
2006-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	Ok I am checking now
2006-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	mythica	RandolphCarter	Thanks
2006-05-12T05:32:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	mythica	np
