2011-01-10T21:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	why do you have 2 NICs connected from one pc ?
2011-01-10T21:53:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj Because i wish to host virtual servers and through "Why the hell not?"
2011-01-10T21:53:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj thought*
2011-01-10T21:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	so you have 2 satic IPs in etc/network/interfaces
2011-01-10T21:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj		static IPs
2011-01-10T21:54:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj Yes, they're connected into a Hub which is connected into my FIOS router-- this PC is also connected into the hub.
2011-01-10T21:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	 are both NICs ethernet ?
2011-01-10T21:56:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj What else could they be?
2011-01-10T21:56:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj That seems like a trick question to me. lol
2011-01-10T21:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	there are some wifi adapters that work off NICs , altho I've never seen any...I had to ask :)
2011-01-10T21:57:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic		BlueKaj They are hard wired NICs, gigabit.
2011-01-10T21:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	so there's no room on your router for a direct connection , you have to use a hub ?
2011-01-10T21:59:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	The router is in the other room, and I hate WiFi. :)
2011-01-10T22:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj		?
2011-01-10T22:00:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	The hub is also gigabit which allows much faster transfers between my 2 PCS - it helps when you play a game over a virtualized OS (such as ESXi)
2011-01-10T22:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	are you using network manager ?
2011-01-10T22:09:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	Is that software or hardware? I'm going to say no.  I'm a linux newbie, but pretty much pro in windows /hardware.
2011-01-10T22:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!networkmanager | Hypoglybetic
2011-01-10T22:10:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	I am running Ubuntu server v10, I have installed gnome..I was trying to install web admin n all that jazz.  So thats whree I stand.
2011-01-10T22:11:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	I am not managing any wireless networks.  They are managed by the router and Laptops (windows)
2011-01-10T22:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj		when did network manager become wifi exclusively , sorry Hypoglybetic , it used to manage ethernet as well, altho I haven't used it in awhile
2011-01-10T22:12:00.000Z	Hypoglybetic	BluesKaj	well I haven't gone out of my way to install that.  Unless it came in the server edition I don't have it. And I'm having other small errors..I'm thinking of just installing Desktop and converting that to my media server. >_>
2011-01-10T22:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	it used to be default \
2011-01-10T22:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Hypoglybetic	i use this pc as our server , but I'm not a gamer so no need for extra NICs, however if you are interested this tutorial can help use the direct approach to networking without some dumb software app that has probs : http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
