2011-01-15T20:49:00.000Z	KM0201	necktie	it doesn't appear to be in the repositoories
2011-01-15T20:49:00.000Z	KM0201	necktie	what are you trying to install?... because that package is not in the default repos.
2011-01-15T20:49:00.000Z	necktie	KM0201	kmenc15
2011-01-15T20:50:00.000Z	KM0201	necktie	why ar eyou trying to install it i mean.. is it a dependency of another package, or what?

2011-01-15T20:50:00.000Z	KM0201	necktie	i've got all "default" and a bunch of extra repos on my pc, and that package is not in my package manager
