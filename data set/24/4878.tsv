2007-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	tds5016		hrm. for some reason I'm unable to archive my home folder into a .tar.gz. but it appears to finish archiving, and then the file isn't there.
2007-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	what is your command
2007-06-30T06:31:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	oh, not familiar with that, doing cd / && sudo tar czpf homebackup.tar.gz /home
2007-06-30T06:31:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	should do it
2007-06-30T06:31:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	you might want to do czpvf, so that you can see the files scrolling across and don't get tempted to kill it
2007-06-30T06:32:00.000Z	tds5016	bruenig	yeah, not only gthat I'd be more likely to see where it fails.
2007-06-30T06:44:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	ls -lh
2007-06-30T06:46:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	or you can do like deb does, tar it up and then create an ar archive
2007-06-30T06:46:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	man ar
2007-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	the gzip thing right
2007-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	sudo sed 's|/us|/ca|g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-06-30T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	great britain
2007-06-30T07:24:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	yeah, it has to go across the freaking ocean
2007-06-30T07:25:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	that error happens from time to time, I am not sure what the deal is exactly
2007-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	tds5016	bruenig	so if I switch to the gb servers it will wokr?
2007-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	do the command I gave you before
2007-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	it will switch you to canada
2007-06-30T07:27:00.000Z	tds5016	bruenig	thanks for the help you offered with canada thouhg :-/. I guess I'm just going to have to wait a week for the download to finish.
2007-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	you can kill it and start over probably, especially if all it has done is started downloading stuff
2007-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	tds5016	bruenig	Whats the command for the canada sservers?
2007-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	sudo sed 's|/us|/ca|g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	tds5016	bruenig	that command will still work after I've already switched to gb?
2007-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	oh no, change /us to /gb
2007-07-10T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	tds5016	sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer && sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla
