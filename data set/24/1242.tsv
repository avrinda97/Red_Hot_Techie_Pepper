2010-05-02T21:58:00.000Z	robin0800	tamed	put on a usb stick and then copy to linux box when you click the deb it will tell you what it needs
2010-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	tamed	robin0800	so again i need to boot into windows and download the package if it asks for something when i click on it ?
2010-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	robin0800	tamed	you can't click on the deb in windows only linux
2010-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	tamed	robin0800	will get back here after facing errors if any
2010-05-02T22:02:00.000Z	robin0800	tamed	just run it see if it finds your modem you will have to configure it to find out
