2008-04-25T15:33:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	You can do that if you want. It will work but it's no advisable... It's probably a better idea to put your home directory on the partition that you backup. The home directory contains things like the linux equivalent of My Documents.
2008-04-25T15:36:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	You can make a folder on your partition that you backup... call it home... you can mount this as the linux default home directory... home is like Windows 'Documents and Settings'
2008-04-25T15:38:00.000Z	josh_	Boredom_inc	 what else goes in my home directory other than documents?\
2008-04-25T15:39:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Things like settings, for programs and such
2008-04-25T15:39:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Or do you mean the specific directories
2008-04-25T15:40:00.000Z	josh_	Boredom_inc	 so all my program data(preferences, documents(if i'm using a word eqivalent), etc) will automagically go into my home directory?
2008-04-25T15:41:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Yeah and you would put downloads and music etc. in there also
2008-04-25T15:45:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	If your used to backing up a partition all the time I recommend making a partition that is just your home directory... you then mount this folder in ubuntu and it is accessed a bit like a folder.... its at the location /home .... If you create a partition I can tell you how to make the partition mount at /home every time ubuntu boots up
2008-04-25T15:47:00.000Z	josh_	Boredom_inc	 i kind of know how the directory structure; my school uses solaris.  i just have no experience as an admin
2008-04-25T15:47:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	You will probably find that you don't need as many programs on linux as windows. Linux programmers are quite adept at sharing libraries (in windows these are dll folders) so one program uses the features of many libraries. Pidgin is a good example (mind you it only uses a few libraries) but it works as a AIM, IRC, MSN, Yahoo (and more) client
2008-04-25T15:53:00.000Z	josh_	Boredom_inc	what games?
2008-04-25T15:54:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	What do you mean by 'what games?'
2008-04-25T15:56:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	I don't play games really but there are a surprisingly large amount of linux games. Not all that many AAA titles but there are a lot of native games that are very good. Otherwise you can just use Wine and run the games straight off your windows partition
2008-04-25T15:59:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	I recommend allocating about 4 GB (ubuntu) + 5 GB (or less for games)... Because by the sounds of it you intend to play windows games and I assume they are already installed on your windows partition, you don't need to reinstall them on linux
2008-04-25T15:59:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Mind you not all of them will run
2008-04-25T16:07:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	If you have lots of RAM your swap file will rarely be used but as a general rule a swap file roughly the size of your ram is good
2008-04-25T16:08:00.000Z	josh_	Boredom_inc	 thanks
2008-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	2GB might even be a bit excessive but there is no harm in having one too big as long as you can spare the harddisk space
2008-04-25T16:17:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Actually you can mount it as anything.. "/games" might be more appropriate
2008-04-25T16:16:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	You said you would play windows games... make a separate partition and mount it as /windows (Here you can install games that are windows only) mind you save some space for linux games on the linux partition
2008-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Ahh ok... So this computer you're using now already has windows. Yeah it's probably best to create a separate /home partition like ifireball said.
2008-04-25T16:20:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	It can read and writes NTFS... I use it all the time because my brother keeps the music on the windows partition. I've never encountered troubles but technically linux isn't 100% NTFS compatible.
2008-04-25T16:21:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	Probably not. I'd recommend it's own ext3 partition.
2008-04-25T16:25:00.000Z	Boredom_inc	josh_	I'm getting a bit lost as to what you are asking now... Just make a ext3 partition and mount it as /home ... You can back it up when you backup your NTFS partition.
