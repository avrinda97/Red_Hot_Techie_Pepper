2008-01-08T21:24:00.000Z	DRebellion		why is ubuntu a .com domain? wouldn't a .org be more appropriate?
2008-01-08T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	they are commercial but that is offtopic for this channel
2008-01-08T21:26:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	i don't see how this is offtopic
2008-01-09T23:08:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	please stop
2008-01-09T23:08:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	???
2008-01-09T23:08:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	i noticed he was a bit slow
2008-01-26T22:17:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	before the end of the year
2008-01-26T22:17:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	why so long?

2008-02-08T22:26:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	this is a Mac we are talking about, I have a similar model and thus my opinion
2008-03-10T21:11:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	the info command is not working with the bot right now
2008-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	thanks for the heads up, maybe put that in the topic?
2008-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	when I get topic naming rights ;]
2008-03-13T22:03:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	aha I've been breaking my system forever then ;]
2008-03-17T20:44:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	he asked this before and I gave him the answer--he is trying to change a mounted partition
2008-03-17T20:45:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	but he's running the livecd and it wouldn't mount his hard drive unless he explicitly told it to (which i think he wouldn't do)
2008-03-17T20:46:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	cant write to ext3? the livecd can certainly do that
2008-03-17T20:46:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	???
2008-08-05T23:17:00.000Z	bazhang	DRebellion	he left
2008-08-05T23:17:00.000Z	DRebellion	bazhang	yeah, probably just a ownership/perms problem
