2012-10-23T12:10:00.000Z	fairuz		From Live CD menu, can I drop to CLI?
2012-10-23T12:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	You can chose "Try without installing" and open GNOME Terminal.
2012-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	fairuz		jordan-U I want to avoid loading the GUI
2012-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	You can also use ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a tty.
2012-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	Why?
2012-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	fairuz		the virtual terminal is available already when the live cd menu comes out?
2012-10-23T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	To which menu are you reffering?
2012-10-23T12:13:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	Live CD menu.
2012-10-23T12:14:00.000Z	fairuz		The menu where you choose to Try Ubuntu or install Ubuntu.
2012-10-23T12:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	I'm going to assume that you're talking about the boot menu, in which case you can boot into single user mode, but that may not be what you want. Why do you not want a GUI? What is your end goal?
2012-10-23T12:14:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	Laptop is very low spec, that it can barely load the gui.
2012-10-23T12:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	Are you trying to install Ubuntu?
2012-10-23T12:15:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	No. Just try to take some data from the HDD
2012-10-23T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	At the syslinux boot menu you can add the kernel parameter "single" to boot into single user mode.
2012-10-23T12:17:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	syslinux boot menu == Live CD menu?
2012-10-23T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	There are multiple menus in the LiveCD, two of which have options for "Try Ubuntu" vs "Install Ubuntu", the second of which is displayed after the GUI has loaded so I assume you're talking about the first, which is the syslinux boot menu. Saying just "LiveCD menu" is not enough.
2012-10-23T12:19:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	I mean the first menu. Sorry.
2012-10-23T12:19:00.000Z	fairuz		What is single user mode btw?
2012-10-23T12:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_user_mode
2012-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	Ok. So single user mode will not load the GUI?
2012-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Changing_the_CD.27s_Default_Boot_Options (though single user mode isn't mentioned there specifically, how to add kernel parameters is, and the kernel parameter you would add would be "single").
2012-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	Correct. It also won't load networking and most other services.
2012-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	fairuz	Jordan_U	Ok thanks
2012-10-23T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fairuz	You're welcome.
