2005-04-24T08:34:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	that's "apt pinning"... "apt *pining*" is when another distro really wishes it uses apt
2005-04-24T08:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	heheh :)

2005-05-09T08:10:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	ok I'll try that, but shouldn't APT::Default-Release "warty"; work?
2005-05-09T08:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	not for a dist-upgrade, no
2005-05-09T08:11:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	ok, thanks
2005-05-09T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	if you want just a few packages you can use apt-get -t unstable or similar
2005-05-09T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	what you are doing is risky anyway :)
2005-05-09T08:13:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	well, I only want to install the debian 2.4.27 kernel source (so I can compile a kernel on this machine for a different woody machine)... not actually installing real binary packages
2005-05-09T08:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	for that you can just download the source package, I guess, and use the kpackage tools for ubuntu
2005-05-09T08:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	kernel-package actually I think
2005-05-09T08:15:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	by source package, you mean the tarball off kernel.org, or the kernel-source-2.4.27.deb package?
2005-05-09T08:15:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	I figured I'd jsut get the .deb package from debian :)
2005-05-09T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	the deb package if you want it for woody
2005-05-09T08:16:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	I'll try to get the preferences file working, since that seems like the right thing to do... thanks for your help
2005-05-09T08:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	I'm not sure I see the point of compiling a kernel like that for woody,, though
2005-05-09T08:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	unless you have particular module needs or something
2005-05-09T08:18:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	the system I'm compiling for isn't powerful enough to compile its own kernel.  I need tmpfs on it, so I figured that as long as I'm compiling a new kernel, may as well make it the most recent debian 2.4.27.  That system will be upgraded to sarge when it's stable anyway, and since 2.4.27 is sarge's kernel, figured I'd do it now and get it over with
2005-05-09T08:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	why not just dist-upgrade to sarge and install the relevant kernel-image package?
2005-05-09T08:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	sarge is pretty stable after all
2005-05-09T08:21:00.000Z	mcdonaldswes	thoreauputic	I probably could, but the system is pretty limited in disk space... don't need all those modules
2005-05-09T08:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	OK I see
2005-05-09T08:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mcdonaldswes	my old P200 MMX is running happily on 2.4.18 :) with woody of course ...
