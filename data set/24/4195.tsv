2012-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	colin_		i'm trying to install Ubuntu on an HP e-pc C10, problem is i have no blank cd-roms and the machine can only boot from USB-FDD but i only have a USB Flash drive, is it possible to format the flashdrive as a USB-FDD and initiate an Ubuntu install from it? maybe a net-install?
2012-10-01T15:12:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	yes
2012-10-01T15:12:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	any pointers? urls?
2012-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	yes :)
2012-10-01T15:16:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	also, under "Put the installer on...", note #9 as it is important :)
2012-10-01T15:16:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	same stuff, different name :)
2012-10-01T15:17:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	well not really, the machine is usb1 not usb2.0 so it cant boot from usb mass storage, i would need to emulate a USB-FDD
2012-10-01T15:19:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	try this one: http://www.pauljoyceuk.com/codex/2012/installing-ubuntu-from-usb-fdd/
2012-10-01T15:32:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	you'll need some form of SHell, might as well use the bundled bash ;)
2012-10-01T15:39:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	pxe, it's really simple actually :)
2012-10-01T15:41:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	;)
2012-10-01T15:42:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	cat5e works just as well thou :) but cat7 is awesome for installation (wiring-wise, not computer-installation)
2012-10-01T15:47:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	... paranoid much? ;)
2012-10-01T15:49:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	no not paranoid, just worried about insurance not covering a burglar being mauled by my dogs
2012-10-01T15:49:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	ooh :P pro-tip: get a better camera ;)
2012-10-01T15:50:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	640x480 ?
2012-10-01T15:50:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	not following
2012-10-01T15:50:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	it could turn the power off thou, if it can't register anything on the port...
2012-10-01T15:52:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	but a camera wont do any good
2012-10-01T15:53:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	never mind the camera-note... got you mixed up with the other guy ^^ support-channels >.<
2012-10-01T15:54:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	the thing is that i have 2 working dogs (malinois) that are supposed to be locked up when off-duty
2012-10-01T15:54:00.000Z	bkc_	colin_	ooh... well... those dogs sure bite hard ^^ I've had a few :)
2012-10-01T15:57:00.000Z	colin_	bkc_	#ubuntu-offtopic if you're interested ;)
