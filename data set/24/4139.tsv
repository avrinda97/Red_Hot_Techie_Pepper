2007-07-11T06:11:00.000Z	Tama00		okay i got a odd problem right..
2007-07-11T06:13:00.000Z	Tama00		i was listing to music on a hard drive... then all of a sudden the music stopped and the play list ran through quickly like all the tracks where dead.. then i checked the mount points and it seamed the hard drive has unmounted itself.. then i went into fdisk -l and it somehow magically my 160gig hard drive was gone and a new drive appeard that was 103gb.. wtf is going on?
2007-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	scary what happened to you
2007-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	did my hard drive die?
2007-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	I dont know...
2007-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	i might restart and see if that fixes things
2007-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	yeah good idea... but i hope the hard drive youe talking about doesnt host your OS
2007-07-11T06:17:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	luckly it doesnt
2007-07-11T06:17:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	worst case scenario you can use rstudio's hard disk recovery tools. they scan for ext3 but it's not free
2007-07-25T07:42:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	it may be an issue with your network...
2007-07-25T07:42:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	nar dont be ridiculous
2007-07-25T07:42:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	i am not being ridiculous
2007-07-25T07:42:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	i can send data to the other pc at full speed no problems
2007-07-25T07:43:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	just samba is gay and doesnt work
2007-07-25T07:43:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	or its vista that is gay and doesnt like samba
2007-07-25T07:43:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	maybe
2007-07-25T07:44:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	there's another way of browsing smb that i know of
2007-07-25T07:44:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	yay tell us
2007-07-25T07:44:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	 you can use fuse to mount the windows network
2007-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	 and you will then access it as if it were local directories
2007-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	damn fuse sounds confusing
2007-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	i did that to access windows network from xfce, it's not too complicated but i forgot how to do it
2007-07-25T07:51:00.000Z	rolfen	Tama00	if you want to give it a try i found the link the the fuse tutorial: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304131&highlight=xubuntu
2007-07-25T07:52:00.000Z	Tama00	rolfen	okay thanks
