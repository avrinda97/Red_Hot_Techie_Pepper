2004-10-22T12:08:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	can you be more specific?  I promise I can help if you give me something to work with :-)  Perhaps an error message, or a description of what you are trying to do that isn't working
2004-10-22T12:08:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	yes sure...give me a sec
2004-10-22T12:08:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	went to this webpage http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2004-10-22T12:09:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	are you using apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic?
2004-10-22T12:12:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	edit /etc/apt/sourcles.list with your favourite text editor
2004-10-22T12:14:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	do I take out the two ##
2004-10-22T12:14:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	do you have the line I posted above in there?
2004-10-22T12:14:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
2004-10-22T12:15:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	the two lines following that, yes
2004-10-22T12:16:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	you'll have to do that as sudo/root, sorry I should have specified that
2004-10-22T12:17:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	that is done
2004-10-22T12:17:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	now do you have any lines in there with the word "marillat" ?
2004-10-22T12:19:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	in your sources.list  -- okay, add a new line that consists entirely of  "deb http://debian.tu-bs.de/mplayer/ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main" 
2004-10-22T12:21:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	done
2004-10-22T12:22:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	now you should be able to install totem-xine and w32codecs from apt-get or synaptic, whichever you prefer
2004-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	what should I write in the terminal to use apt-get to install the totem xine and etc?
2004-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	"sudo apt-get install totem-xine w32codecs"
2004-10-22T12:25:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	sorry, do an "sudo apt-get update" first
2004-10-22T12:27:00.000Z	theantix	Seealot	just run "sudo apt-get update" with no arguments, then do "sudo apt-get install totem-xine w32codecs"
2004-10-22T13:10:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	done that and it seems to work...but one tiny error
2004-10-22T13:11:00.000Z	Seealot	theantix	W: Couldn't stat source package list http://debian.tu-bs.de unstable/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/debian.tu-bs.de_mplayer_ftp.netrim.net_debian-marillat_dists_unstable_main_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
