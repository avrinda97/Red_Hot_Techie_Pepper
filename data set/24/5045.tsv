2008-01-03T17:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	It'd be easier to just use a LiveCD :)
2008-01-03T17:24:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	but i'm affraid i need more packages then my ram can handle
2008-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	Ahh, what exactly are you trying to test?
2008-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	a webcam driver https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4698310
2008-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	i need to have build essential, v4l and a webcam app
2008-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	I would go with a vanilla kernel of exactly the version he is suggesting be used rather than the hardy kernel
2008-01-03T17:28:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	well, he mentions to use A rc kernel, so all versions should work
2008-01-03T17:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	i had already found the wiki page in the ubotu message, but it only mentions compile the kernel for the current version you are using, not some other
2008-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	or do i have to download the packages manually
2008-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	maybe it's easier to install ubuntu on a external hd or sd card
2008-01-03T17:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	It's a good experience to have if you like that sort of thing, but if you don't know what you are doing you could break your current install
2008-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	are you referring to the custom kernel build or installing on a flash driver?
2008-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	driver=drive
2008-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	Custom kernel
2008-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	i know, that's why i'm looking for alternatives
2008-01-03T18:32:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	i tried using the live cd for testing the webcam driver and it worked. Thanks for your help
2008-01-03T18:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	np
2008-01-03T18:33:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	but where are all the downloaded packages saved. I dont have that much ram
2008-01-03T18:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	Do you have a swap partition?
2008-01-03T18:34:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Jordan_U	on the internal hd. Does the livecd use that?
2008-01-03T18:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenSentMe	I think so, I'm not sure though
