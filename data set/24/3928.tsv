2007-09-01T06:46:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	i've always had great luck with "envy" for graphics drivers, although it's not officially supported
2007-09-01T06:47:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	But I want my nvidia installed >.<
2007-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	I don't understand.
2007-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX I need its driver installed
2007-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	Yes, and i've allways had great luck with envy.
2007-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Your making no sence
2007-09-01T06:49:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	That grabs the right drivers for the card, in this case 'nvidia', installs the nvidia-settings pannel, and mods your xorg.conf to use the new drivers
2007-09-01T06:50:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	http://albertomilone.com/ubuntu/nvidia/scripts/envy_0.9.7-0ubuntu8_all.deb just open that file, and synaptic/packagemanager will install for you
2007-09-01T06:51:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	What do I do when its installed?
2007-09-01T06:51:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	run envy from apps>system tools>envy. you can also get a terminal interface with "sudo envy" at the terminal
2007-09-01T06:52:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Thanks, where can I find this if I ever have to re-install linux, I know I won't remember that link lol
2007-09-01T06:53:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	albertomilone.com
2007-09-01T06:53:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	or, of course, a google search for "envy nvidia graphics drivers ubuntu" or something like that
2007-09-01T06:54:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Thanks esteth, you've been a BIG help
2007-09-01T06:54:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	np. as a word of caution, you should backup your /etc/X11/xorg.conf before you run envy, in case you end up unable to boot X
2007-09-01T07:07:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	It installed my drivers and stuff perfectly, but how do I get more resoultion, im capped at 1024x768
2007-09-01T07:07:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	bring up a terminal and type "gksudo nvidia-settings"
2007-09-01T07:08:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	then the section called "X Server Display Configuration", and there should be a setting for resolution
2007-09-01T07:08:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Once again good job ^^ yay for you
2007-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Any idea why my Adobe Flash player download is sooooooo slow?
2007-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	I'm not sure. If it's only the flash player downlad that's slow, you might just be downloading from a slow server.
2007-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	hopender_	Esteth	Have you seen Beryl or Compiz Fusion how they can like manually twist the cube and the cube has a background, any idea how to do that?
2007-09-01T07:15:00.000Z	Esteth	hopender_	http://forlong.blogage.de/article/2007/8/26/The-best-way-to-install-Compiz-Fusion-on-Ubuntu-Feisty looks good for getting compiz up and running, i followed a different howto, but i can't find it right now
