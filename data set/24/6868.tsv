2005-07-11T15:35:00.000Z	hmrocha		Hello
2005-07-11T15:36:00.000Z	hmrocha		I'm having trouble installing a printer.
2005-07-11T15:36:00.000Z	hmrocha		I have a server called "printers"
2005-07-11T15:36:00.000Z	hmrocha		That has a printer named "laserc6"
2005-07-11T15:36:00.000Z	hmrocha		How can i use it in this computer?
2005-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	hmrocha		In the "Add printer" dialog i chose "Network printer CUPS Printer"
2005-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	hmrocha		But what's the URI?
2005-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	Maybe you can help me. I am trying to install a Canon i250 printer; there is no driver and it is not detected as a "local printer".
2005-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	i don't have a local printer
2005-09-27T12:55:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	install what?
2005-09-27T12:56:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	sun-j2sdk1.5, haskell compiler, prolog compiler, etc, etc.
2005-09-27T12:56:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	C compiler too, emacs, and a lot more stuff
2005-09-27T12:58:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	i think the best way is to install ubuntu in a machine, download everything and copy all .deb from /var/apt/cache to the cd
2005-09-27T12:59:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	what's wrong with the regular install?
2005-09-27T13:00:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	i'll give two cd's to the students
2005-09-27T13:00:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	one with hoary, and another with software used in our faculty
2005-09-27T13:00:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	sorry i don't think i got the jist of what you were saying before
2005-09-27T13:00:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	oh i see
2005-09-27T13:01:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	so they can install hoary and then all of the packages you use from the other cd, right?
2005-09-27T13:01:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	they install hoary, and install all the .deb they need from the other cd
2005-09-27T13:02:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	it would be great if they could define that cd as a repository, but i don't know if that's possible
2005-09-27T13:02:00.000Z	hmrocha	jamey3	i have to go now, bye
2005-09-27T13:02:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	as in your own private repos for your students?
2005-09-27T13:02:00.000Z	jamey3	hmrocha	oh okay cya around, by
