2011-03-07T12:39:00.000Z	noah1989		i found that you can use consolechars to set the console (non X) font
2011-03-07T12:39:00.000Z	noah1989		is there a way to set a margin so that the console starts 100px from the left?
2011-03-07T12:40:00.000Z	noah1989		because i have an unusual screen that always swallows some pixels on the left side
2011-03-07T12:40:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	probably in your .bash_profile
2011-03-07T12:41:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	hm.. that could fix it for the bash prompt. but i want the whole console to be constarained
2011-03-07T12:41:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	what's the problem?
2011-03-07T12:42:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	i want the console to use only the right part of the framebuffer
2011-03-07T12:42:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	because the left-most 100 px are off screen
2011-03-07T12:42:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	why not fix that instead of circumventing the problem?
2011-03-07T12:43:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	is this a gui install or just a command line only?
2011-03-07T12:43:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	it#s command line only
2011-03-07T12:44:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	no X
2011-03-07T12:44:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	what about appending a vga code to the end of the kernel line?
2011-03-07T12:44:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	something like vga=771
2011-03-07T12:44:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	this is happening on a ARM board, it has a completely different display driver
2011-03-07T12:45:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	so can't you specify a vga code to the frame buffer on boot still?
2011-03-07T12:45:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	http://pierre.baudu.in/other/grub.vga.modes.html
2011-03-07T12:46:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	no. this is on a beagleboard. it has no vga-compatible graphics
2011-03-07T12:46:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	it has it's own options but none of the available modes fits my screen
2011-03-07T12:47:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	hrm... let me do some searching then
2011-03-07T12:48:00.000Z	noah1989	histo	all i need is a workaround at console driver level
2011-03-07T12:48:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	yeah I hear ya
2011-03-07T12:50:00.000Z	histo	noah1989	you'd probably find morehelp in #linuxhelp or something similar since yoru problem isn't ubuntu specific
