2008-03-21T04:45:00.000Z	phenom		I'd like to watch it. Without doing a 007.
2008-03-21T04:45:00.000Z	phenom		:/
2008-03-21T04:45:00.000Z	phenom		Part 1 works fine grr.
2008-03-21T04:46:00.000Z	phenom		I'd have to check part1, It started playing as soon as I put it in.
2008-03-21T04:46:00.000Z	phenom		I can playback wmv's, but this one is DRM encrypted.
2008-03-21T04:47:00.000Z	phenom		Mplayer, says the file is "encumbered" in DRM encryption, hehe and grrr

2008-03-21T04:48:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	partdon?
2008-03-21T04:50:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	Was that a show of power?
2008-03-21T04:53:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	you're still here, yes?
2008-03-21T04:54:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	I don't appreciate your show of power. Why don't you mod Undernet if you want to start kicking people. They need trigger happy help.
2008-03-21T04:55:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	and i don't like an endless parade of anonymous teenagers complaing they can't swear. so there it is. if you'd like to make a larger issue of it, i would suggest re-thinking that idea.
2009-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	so run +1 and file bug reports
2009-11-10T06:07:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	this is a support channel. if you have a specific issue, please state it. but #ubuntu is not the proper channel for "this whole release stinks" chatter.
2009-11-10T06:08:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	Ok. Firefox now hangs whenever I full screen any vid/youtube clip of the like.
2009-11-10T06:09:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	that's an issue with the proprietary Flash plugin over which Ubuntu has no control. file a bug report with Adobe.
2009-11-10T06:10:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	I do agree it is a flash issue, but it was working in hardy iirc
2009-11-10T06:10:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	Ubuntu developers have no control over what the plugin does or does not do, or regressions in Flash/
2009-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	Right. Any idea why my system beeps repeatedly on shutdown?
2009-11-10T06:12:00.000Z	mneptok	phenom	what does syslog / dmesg /messages say about it?
2009-11-10T06:16:00.000Z	phenom	mneptok	Honestly, I don't have the mind to dig through system files at present.
