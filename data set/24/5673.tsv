2006-07-13T11:49:00.000Z	xxyyzz		How do I find out if my computer has wireless or not? I'm not sure if Ubuntu is supposed to detect wireless 'cause I'm not sure if I have it or not, heh
2006-07-13T11:49:00.000Z	xxyyzz		It's a compaq presario v2000 ... I dunno if it comes with a wireless card =/
2006-07-13T11:50:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	wireless can be a pci, usb or pccard device - I would do: sudo apt-get install lshw, then lshw|less to see what all you have
2006-07-13T11:52:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	lshw may be on the install CD
2006-07-13T11:52:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	hmm, not sure if the dapper thing uses the install CD anymore
2006-07-13T11:54:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	lshw|less
2006-07-13T11:55:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	/string
2006-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	no. once you see stuff, hit /string
2006-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	okay, what string am I looking for in the output of lshw ?
2006-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	tacos
2006-07-13T11:56:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	thanks, brb
2006-07-13T11:57:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	I get "Pattern not found (Press Return)"
2006-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	then there are no tacos in your box.  (
2006-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	what is tacos ? Is that wireless?
2006-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	no - sorry - I was kidding - tacos are .. mexican food
2006-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	you were looking for something - I figured you knew what you were looking for
2006-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	I have no idea what 'lshw' returns =-/
2006-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	I would read the whole thing - it isnt that much
2006-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	okay, but after I've read it, how will I know if it has wireless?
2006-07-13T12:00:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	im guessing if you have it you will know
2006-07-13T12:05:00.000Z	xxyyzz	CarlFK	there was lots of stuff about 'bridges' and 'hosts', but nothing about 'wireless' :(
2006-07-13T12:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	sudo lshw|xclip  middle click in  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-07-13T12:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	may have to install xclip, but if no connection, don't bother
2006-07-13T12:11:00.000Z	CarlFK	xxyyzz	find the part that says "-network" and then look up the product and see what it is
