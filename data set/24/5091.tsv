2006-10-30T17:07:00.000Z	Thib_		does anyone know what happened to System > Administration > Disks in Edgy? I don't see it anymore
2006-10-30T17:08:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	I think it has become GNOME Partition Manager
2006-10-30T17:08:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	s/Manager/Editor/
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	I don't see it either; or is the partition editor just not an icon in System > Administration?
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	I have it there.
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	you have System > Administration > Partition Editor ?
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	yes
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	I don't
2006-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	I don't have it in my menu, and it doesn't appear as an unselected choice for it in System > Preferences > Menu Layout
2006-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	I don't know then.
2006-10-30T17:23:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	It might have been something unusual with the upgrade.
2006-10-30T17:23:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	You did have ubuntu-desktop installed, right?
2006-10-30T17:24:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	yes.
2006-10-30T17:24:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	My installation was done with debootstrap, a loop mounted edgy iso, and a dapper livecd, so my installation may be unusual, but let me check it.
2006-10-30T17:27:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	gparted doesn't _appear_ to be installed by default except on the livecd. Maybe you should ask whether it has been removed on #ubuntu-devel.
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	but do you have Disks, then? I mean, my initial question really amounted to: "That's weird, I don't seem to have any way to manage my disks anymore in Edgy"
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	No, I don't have disks.
2006-10-30T17:28:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	But the way your question is going, you should probably ask on devel
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	ah, so it seems to be the case that the disk management tool is just no longer offered.
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	what's devel?
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	#ubuntu-devel
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	cge	Thib_	The channel for ubuntu development.
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	oh lol, okay.
2006-10-30T17:29:00.000Z	Thib_	cge	I didn't know this existed.
