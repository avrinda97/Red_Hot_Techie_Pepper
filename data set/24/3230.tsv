2008-06-24T17:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	use space to add and remove x's from what you want/don't want
2008-06-24T17:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	you could try in terminal:  sudo tasksel
2008-06-24T17:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	*'s rather
2008-06-24T17:03:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	I couldn't understand
2008-06-24T17:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	take a look at that command, but be careful
2008-06-24T17:08:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	I have asked this problem to alot of people but they couldn't solve it, I think you are an expert can you take a look?
2008-06-24T17:09:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	well, for one, my wmv files play fine without w32codecs
2008-06-24T17:09:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	it gives this thing
2008-06-24T17:10:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	I use totem with the addins it suggested when I tried to play my first wmv
2008-06-24T17:11:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	those would be the gstreamer plugins
2008-06-24T17:11:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	sudo apt-get install gstreamer* ?
2008-06-24T17:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly liba52-0.7.4 libavcodec1d libavformat1d libavutil1d libdc1394-13 libdvdread3 libgsm1 libid3tag0 libmad0
2008-06-24T17:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	all on one line, should cover it
2008-06-24T17:15:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	all of them were installed
2008-06-24T17:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	and you have tried to play the file with totem?
2008-06-24T17:16:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	dr_Wills suggests from the #kubuntu says focus on faad packs...
2008-06-24T17:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	nyuu	fair enough, mine just worked
2008-06-24T17:17:00.000Z	nyuu	DistroJockey	ok
