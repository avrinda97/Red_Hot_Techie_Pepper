2011-03-08T12:27:00.000Z	smbhelp		has anyone else had problems getting network shares to show up in Places>Network>Workgroup?  I can't seem to get Ubuntu to connect to a NAS unless I type nautilus smb://192.168.1.1 and I've read a ton of posts, but they seem to be outdated for Ubuntu 10.10.
2011-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	smbhelp		which one?  on the nas or my computer?
2011-03-08T12:28:00.000Z	smbhelp		both are default and I have smbclient on the computer
2011-03-08T12:29:00.000Z	smbhelp		so do I even need to mess with the smb.conf on the computer since I'm not using smbd on the comp?
2011-03-08T12:29:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	are both running ubuntu?
2011-03-08T12:30:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	no, the router is running dd-wrt and smbd under it and my computer is running ubuntu
2011-03-08T12:30:00.000Z	jleg94		okay, so do you know what the name of the workgroup on the router is?
2011-03-08T12:30:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	my windows machines have no problem seeing it
2011-03-08T12:31:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	yes, workgroup is it
2011-03-08T12:31:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	any authentication required?
2011-03-08T12:31:00.000Z	smbhelp		jleg and thats the default in smb.conf as well, right?
2011-03-08T12:31:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	no, guest account and full access
2011-03-08T12:32:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	okay. and yes by default it is set to use workgroup.
2011-03-08T12:32:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	you may want to try specifying a couple other parameters though on top of the default configuration
2011-03-08T12:33:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	when I do 'smbclient --list=192.168.1.1 --user=guest --no-pass' it sees the share but wont let me browse to it
2011-03-08T12:33:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	and mapping it using nautilus smb://... is dumb b/c it wont show up in other programs as a place to save or load from
2011-03-08T12:34:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	alright. try seeing if this helps. edit your smb.conf and add the line "netbios name = hostname" under global
2011-03-08T12:34:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	edit smb.conf on computer or router?
2011-03-08T12:34:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	the computer
2011-03-08T12:35:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	also change "wins support = no" to yes
2011-03-08T12:36:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	save that and then install winbind. Once that's done restart samba and cross your fingers
2011-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	you may need to restart networking as well too
2011-03-08T12:37:00.000Z	smbhelp	jleg94	this is starting to sound a lot like a post I read... but will try
2011-03-08T12:38:00.000Z	jleg94	smbhelp	alright just tell me if you have any more trouble
