2010-03-21T18:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	Try "sudo apt-get -f install"
2010-03-21T18:08:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	If this doesn't work, Ubuntu fellas broke something it seems, sorry for you.
2010-03-21T18:09:00.000Z	ori	theadmin	i did it... but now what? retype it?
2010-03-21T18:09:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	Try to install again now
2010-03-21T18:12:00.000Z	ori	theadmin	is it possible that the problem is that im following instructions for hardy?
2010-03-21T18:12:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	...most likely.
2010-03-21T18:17:00.000Z	ori	theadmin	i typed this: sudo apt-get install google-gadgets-gt, and got: E: Couldn't find package google-gadgets-gt... Do u you know how/ where i can download it from?
2010-03-21T20:24:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	How would it know whether it works "fine"?
2010-03-21T20:25:00.000Z	ori	theadmin	wat happens is i open it up, and type something in, but no search options come up. And when it worked, the search options did come up
2010-03-22T23:55:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	Yeah, but i've no idea why you'd run it as root. Altho if instructions say so...
2010-03-24T22:21:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	Beter.
2010-03-24T22:21:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	It's WINE, but it also gets game-specific patches and stuff.
2010-03-24T22:21:00.000Z	ori	theadmin	but its only sold?
2010-03-24T22:21:00.000Z	theadmin	ori	Err, playonlinux is free.
