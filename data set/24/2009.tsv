2009-06-27T00:50:00.000Z	Bennit		is there a piece of software that guides you through using ubuntu for the first time? (for some ppl who never used anything else but windhoos)

2009-06-27T00:51:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	there is the free pocket guide for Ubuntu
2009-06-27T00:51:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/download_main.html
2009-06-27T00:51:00.000Z	Bennit	mrwes	and everyone else sayng "READ THE MANUAL" but then a bit empathized, it's for newbies that don't even know that something else exists :p
2009-06-27T00:52:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	actually RTFM is not part of the Ubuntu philosophy
2009-06-27T00:53:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	the pocket guide is it
2009-06-27T00:53:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	it's the companion for day to day use of Ubuntu
2009-06-27T00:54:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	but then again, where ever you go there are help vampires ya know?
2009-06-27T00:55:00.000Z	Bennit	mrwes	sorry to break it to you but "hey, here's 20 pages of reading" isn't very appealing to non-technics
2009-06-27T00:55:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	what exactly are you expectations?
2009-06-27T00:56:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	reading is fundamental brutha
2009-06-27T00:56:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	If I want to know how to bake a cake, don't I read a recipe ?
2009-06-27T00:57:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	like the 'Tip of the Day'?
2009-06-27T00:59:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	use the synaptic package manager and install vlc -- easy man
2009-06-27T00:59:00.000Z	Bennit	mrwes	you don't have to tell me how to install something under linux, I got plenty of ways, but i'm just saying that for windhoos ppl it's not all that obvious
2009-06-27T01:28:00.000Z	Bennit	mrwes	http://igor.rave.org/bcorne/other/ubuntu_intro.txt
2009-06-27T01:29:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	and what would I do with that?
2009-06-27T01:30:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	why are you using Ubuntu? To bitch about it?
2009-06-27T01:30:00.000Z	Bennit	mrwes	is that bitching about it? I said there could be an intro software so people would get accomodated more easily
2009-06-27T01:31:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	send it off to the devs
2009-06-27T01:34:00.000Z	mrwes	Bennit	this is normally the first thing I have people read who want to run Ubuntu and/or Linux
