2009-10-27T15:40:00.000Z	conb123		Hiya does anyone know how i can remove all of the kde programs without removing the desktop environment itself
2009-10-27T15:40:00.000Z	conb123		?
2009-10-27T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	then either uninstall them, or use alacarte / kmenuedit   to remove them
2009-10-27T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	its the problem with installing the metapackage if youo just want the desktop
2009-10-27T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	like if people just want xfce desktop I dont advise they install xubuntu-desktop   its massive, you can install xfce4 get the desktop but not so many of the apps which keeps things nice and neat
2009-11-20T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	right click desktop -> add panel
2009-11-20T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	nar, much simpler
2009-11-20T16:26:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Right so what exactly do i need on the bar again, window list, show desktop button, that's it isn't it?
2009-11-20T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=288042    is like net send
2010-03-18T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	do you have 3D asccelleration setup?
2010-03-18T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	if you press ALT+F2 and type: compiz --replace     does it all enable?
2010-03-18T00:25:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Yup I got it all working fine before, rotate cuve was working just all resets after reboot
2010-03-18T00:26:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	After I set it again everything works fine, I am using proprietary ati drivers on a radeon hd 5750 by the way
2010-03-18T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	then add a startup entry to run the command, all done
2010-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Oh ok then awesome, it's just last time I had compiz working and i didn't need to add that command it did everything automatically
2010-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	thats all i can suggest. personally i dont use compiz at all
2010-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Ok thanks for all your help :D
2010-06-09T23:01:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Ah, but google is the best
2010-09-28T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2010-09-28T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	how did you add it?
2010-09-28T04:26:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Network Manager
2010-09-28T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	conb123	did you restart network manager?
2010-09-28T04:26:00.000Z	conb123	ActionParsnip	Ah, of course, forgot about that, thanks
