2008-11-14T04:23:00.000Z	antares	georgy_28	yeah... For Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) and above most of the instructions below are obsolete. For 7.10, just plug in your supported adapter and an icon appears in the top right. Right click to setup your preferences. Devices will auto connect to your PC and you can setup security as you connect each device, e.g. your phone.
