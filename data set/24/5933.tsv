2006-07-31T16:21:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	er... oh, you might need to enable universe... heh, I had like a dozen hits

2006-07-31T16:22:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	ddclient or ipcheck, are two that mention dyndns specificially
2006-07-31T16:23:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	did you update since then?  since... I'm staring at them right now.  Let me double check to make sure theyre still avail in dapper
2006-07-31T16:23:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	I'm not searching right lol soz
2006-07-31T16:23:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	oh, search in descriptions

2006-07-31T16:24:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	how do i search in descriptions though?
2006-07-31T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	in, synaptic? or what?
2006-07-31T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	in the little dropdown box make sure it says 'package names and descriptions'
2006-08-13T05:01:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	yeah
2006-08-13T05:01:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	how so?
2006-08-13T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-08-13T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	you just need to reinstall grub, assuming everything is still good partition wise.
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	so I just install windoze as normal and re-install GRUB. correct?
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	in theory ;)
2006-08-13T05:04:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	I don't think I'll risk it. Any chance of getting windoze to work on VMWare or Qemu?
2006-09-03T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	DJAdmiral	its second alpha of Edgy (like Dapper's Flights)
2006-09-03T05:05:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	Flannel	thanks
