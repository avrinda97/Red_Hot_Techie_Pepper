2007-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	AmirB		help! ubuntu isn't letting me back-up a folder with a bunch of .doc and .odt files to my server! it's telling me I don't have permission for each one of the files I try to upload! what can I do?
2007-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	Try opening the ftp program as root
2007-06-04T09:10:00.000Z	eetfuk		or nautilus for that matter
2007-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	eetfuk		whatever you use to copy
2007-06-04T09:11:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	how do I do that? (plus, it's not an ftp program, it's a local network server, so it opens like a normal folder on my computer)
2007-06-04T09:12:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	try gksudo nautilus
2007-06-04T09:13:00.000Z	eetfuk		it will open another window, and use that for copying and pasting
2007-06-04T09:13:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	ok, I'll try that. thank you
2007-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	eetfuk		Im having trouble with the 3D modules for openChrome
2007-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	eetfuk		Lactymology: ifconfig
2007-06-04T09:15:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	hmm...I don't know how to get to the server's location in nautilus. It starts in the filesystem but the server is external and through the network. normally I'd get to it from places -> Network
2007-06-04T09:17:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	sudo chown <yourusername> <path to *.doc *odt>
2007-06-04T09:18:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	ok, thanks!
2007-06-04T09:18:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	gives you ownership, i bet you will be able to move them whereever then, if you have access to move files to the external server aswell
2007-06-04T09:19:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	does it work on folders too, or just files?
2007-06-04T09:19:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	it should perhaps work on folders aswell
2007-06-04T09:19:00.000Z	eetfuk		but i guess
2007-06-04T09:19:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	ok, great. thanks again!
2007-06-04T09:20:00.000Z	eetfuk		congrats
2007-06-04T09:21:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	uh oh, now it looks like it's gotten stuck while copying. it says "copying files" but it's not doing anything
2007-06-04T09:22:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	You sure you have suficient writing access on the external server?
2007-06-04T09:23:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	hmm...I dont know, but I think so because I've manager to copy other things to this server, it's just these word files which are giving me a hard time for some reason. how do I check about the access though?
2007-06-04T09:26:00.000Z	eetfuk	AmirB	Going to eat now, but try selecting the files in the folder, rightclick, go to properties/Permissions, and select Read and Write, on all groups that should give you full access to the files. If it still dont work, put them in the same folder as the previous files. Or rename their extension, with "mv".. For info on how to use it, check "man mv"
2007-06-04T09:27:00.000Z	AmirB	eetfuk	ok, thanks for all the help!
