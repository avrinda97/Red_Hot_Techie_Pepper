2005-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	caps wont get you help
2005-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	use the VESA driver when you run the above command
2005-12-28T13:23:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	how do i run that driver?
2005-12-28T13:23:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	you read what ubotu sent you and choose the VESA driver
2005-12-28T13:27:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	do i reboot the machine now?
2005-12-28T13:27:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	nope. just log out and back in
2005-12-28T13:28:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	is there anything else that could be slowing the machine down apart from gfx? i've installed the linux kernal, and done what you said. i'm about to log out, but what if it doesn't work and the PC is still slow?
2005-12-28T13:30:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	what kind of PC was it again? (the hardware?)
2005-12-28T13:30:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	AMD Duron 1GHz, 192MB RAM (8MB shared to GFX), O/B Sound, Netgear 10/100 LAN card, Seagate 40GB HDD, 24x CDROM
2005-12-28T13:36:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	it's still on the slow side :(
2005-12-28T13:37:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	is there any difference between gnome and xfce - can i still do all the stuff i do with it with xfce?
2005-12-28T13:38:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	yes you can.
2005-12-28T13:38:00.000Z	M3G4	nalioth	so what are these things then? why would they make a difference?
2005-12-28T13:39:00.000Z	nalioth	M3G4	i don't know your hardware specs, xubuntu is made for older systems
