2010-12-23T13:13:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	propreitly?
2010-12-23T13:14:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	was this from bootup?
2010-12-23T13:17:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	did you try restarting before? or is this the first time it happened?
2010-12-23T13:19:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	did it stop subsequently? or did the problem persist (on the other version)
2010-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	ok maybe some program may be interfering temporarily then :)
2010-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	:)

2010-12-23T13:24:00.000Z	rs0832	cosmin_	you just missed an informative conversation about it :)
