2011-10-24T17:03:00.000Z	GooeY		Hi all. I was using ubuntu yesterday, and it went crazy on me. The dash and the sound, wifi, etc menu are gone. All i have left is the menu bar to the left and the desktop. Any way to fix that?
2011-10-24T17:04:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Let's start from scratch. What distribution are you using, did you had an update of your distribtuion recently?
2011-10-24T17:05:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	So you are saying plain install, build from scratch, you didn't apply any recent updates, and noone has touched your OS nor your home directory yet, right?
2011-10-24T17:09:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Are you using Unity?
2011-10-24T17:11:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	In case you don't use any specific settings, and login into the system then yes. But I am still puzzled bny your issue, since I still don't know what you are missing. A screenshot might help us understand the problem more
2011-10-24T17:16:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	The Unity desktop looks like this in default this way... http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/img/2010/05/ubuntu-unity.png - How does your look? It might be just something you clicked on, and you cannot get it back...
2011-10-24T17:18:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	So that's why a screenshot might shows us the current look more, so that's why I am already asking for that for the third time :)
2011-10-24T17:19:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Press Print-Screen, save file, upload to somewhere
2011-10-24T17:46:00.000Z	GooeY	norbert79	There is only one user. So you mean just log off and back on?
2011-10-24T17:33:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Doesn't work. Check link again
2011-10-24T17:35:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Nope, didn't work either. It says: the listed page cannot be found. Are you sure you are trying to share with the right authority set for this directory?
2011-10-24T17:36:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	If it fails, try imageshack.us or something other...
2011-10-24T17:39:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Now I see what you mean... Hmm, can be also caused by different issues. You might try to run gnome-appearance-properties and change the theme back to default.
2011-10-24T17:41:00.000Z	GooeY	norbert79	how do i do that? :)
2011-10-24T17:41:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Alt+F2
2011-10-24T17:44:00.000Z	GooeY	norbert79	Alt + F2 does nothing
2011-10-24T17:44:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	That's an issue. Ok, let's approach this from a different way. Go inside console, Ctrl-Alt-F1, and "sudo su" to root. Then give a password for root (it shall be complicated), and then try to logon with root to GUI of Ubuntu.
2011-10-24T17:44:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Let's see if it's limited to the user you are using, or system-wide
2011-10-24T17:45:00.000Z	GooeY	norbert79	done
2011-10-24T17:45:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Ok, close the terminal you were in, and go to main logon screen. Try to logon with root, and let it load
2011-10-24T17:47:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	No. There is root too, just not listed by the Gnome Logon window after start. When it asks foir the user, click "logon with other", type root and the password
2011-10-24T18:00:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Hmm. Don't know, maybe it lacks some settings
2011-10-24T18:00:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	But it more worries me why your settings went into the dumps. It might be also a sign of other problems
2011-10-24T18:00:00.000Z	norbert79	GooeY	Unless Unity got updated while you were playing with some settings
