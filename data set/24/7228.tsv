2005-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	Xgates		hell I mean my box is no scream machine but for Linux its fast enough, AMD 1.1 on 384MB, and I'm even running Blackbox on a custom compiled kernel, with just about all the startup services killed, and XINE is still choppy
2005-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	Xgates		I  mean hell thats crap
2005-04-25T08:34:00.000Z	Xgates		errrr

2005-04-25T08:35:00.000Z	Xgates		hmm
2005-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	is dma turned on all drives?
2005-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	not sure, and cant remember how to check
2005-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	hdparm -tT
2005-04-25T08:36:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	hdparm -tT /dev/hdx
2005-04-25T08:38:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	 Timing cached reads:   436 MB in  2.02 seconds = 216.30 MB/sec
2005-04-25T08:39:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	does it say dma (on)?
2005-04-25T08:39:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	no I didnt see that just what I pasted you
2005-04-25T08:39:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	what Ubuntu has it off by default?
2005-04-25T08:40:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	not on harddrives but sometimes roms do not have it turned on. use hdparm on your drives with no -tT
2005-04-25T08:41:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	sorry run it how?
2005-04-25T08:41:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	haparm /dev/hdx
2005-04-25T08:41:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	hdparm /dev/hdx
2005-04-25T08:41:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	hdparm  /dev/hdx
2005-04-25T08:42:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	 using_dma    =  1 (on)
2005-04-25T08:42:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	do all of your drives like that
2005-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	I only have one drive, and I ran that
2005-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	Anubis	Xgates	surely you have a rom device, which is another drive
2005-04-25T08:46:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	I cant say I know about the rom
2005-04-25T08:46:00.000Z	Xgates	Anubis	I just have one hdd --> /dev/hda
