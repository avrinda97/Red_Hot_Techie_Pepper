2009-11-21T13:06:00.000Z	digitalfiz		anybody have an example script that runs a program and enters y when asked a question?
2009-11-21T13:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 you mean to automate some task and have it 'auto' answer a command from a script?
2009-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	yes im using a cpanel command that asks are you sure and im trying to automate deleting 800+ domains so pressing y by hand for each one is a pain lol
2009-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 see 'expect'  or the 'yes' command :)     'yes | command thatasks'  (but expect is proberly a better tool)
2009-11-21T13:12:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	yes worked perfect ty :)
2010-03-10T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 use some of the various clipboard manager tools. many of them have a 'history' feature that keeps the clipboards
2010-07-05T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 what are you trying tio compile?
2010-07-05T18:14:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	snowglobe viewer its for a game called secondlife
2010-07-05T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 Hmm. well if it was in the repos. theres an apt-get feature to auto-install all needed dependencies/dev files..
2010-07-05T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 perhasp you need --> libdb-dev - Berkeley Database Libraries [development]
2010-07-05T18:15:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	yeah its called auto-apt it worked well forthe older vewer but this new one has been completely recoded and auto-apt doesnt seem to be getting any new stuff i may need
2010-07-05T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 but the db version is 4.7 in 10.04 it seem,s
2010-07-05T18:16:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	yeah maybe i can change the cmake files i dunno im new to compiling :P
2010-07-05T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 i was refering to the 'apt-get build-dep PACKAGENAME' command.
2010-07-05T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 that build-dep makes it very easy to pull in stuff to compile new versions of stuff. :)
2010-07-05T18:17:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	yeah just useless with stuff not in repo :/
2010-07-05T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 I use it to 'shotgun' install dev stuff i may eventually need. :)
2010-07-05T18:21:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	symlinking 4.8 to 4.2 worked :P
2010-07-05T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 thats a dirty trick. :)
2010-07-05T18:21:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Dr_Willis	hehe but if it compiles im happy :P
2010-07-05T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	digitalfiz	 ive had that not work befor.  but if it works
