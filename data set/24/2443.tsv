2008-12-12T17:25:00.000Z	kamizu		hello
2008-12-12T17:25:00.000Z	kamizu		can someone please help me install ubuntu on my raid drives?
2008-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	kamizu		please....
2008-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	kamizu		i booted from the 8.10 ubuntu LIVE CD and opened a terminal
2008-12-12T17:26:00.000Z	kamizu		i followed the steps in here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
2008-12-12T17:27:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	either you have a good hw raid, so ubuntu does not really know you have raid
2008-12-12T17:27:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	what does fdisk -l say?
2008-12-12T17:30:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	are you there?
2008-12-12T17:31:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	yes, but you need to mention my name in your lines directed to me :) so you have more than 1 hd, but only 1 is detected?
2008-12-12T17:31:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	sounds like this is already the virtual raid device. but i agree with ikonia
2008-12-12T17:34:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	so what do i do?
2008-12-12T17:39:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	softraid is linux native, fakeraid is with some not real support by hardware, not too much difference
2008-12-12T17:40:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	sure
2008-12-12T17:41:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	i guess it is already detected, as only one disk show up in fdisk -l
2008-12-12T17:41:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	no two disks showed up
2008-12-12T17:41:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	ah ok, you only pasted sda1
2008-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	or they got unsynced by linux somehow...
2008-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	just define a new array
2008-12-12T17:46:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	i have 500 gigs of data
2008-12-12T17:46:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	raid5 or mirror or what?
2008-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	if its a mirror just take one drive out of the config and copy data to that
2008-12-12T17:49:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	i'm on raid0
2008-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	nibbler_	kamizu	raid0 is the best, lose one hd, lose all data :D
2008-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	kamizu	nibbler_	i have it all backed up on an external lol
