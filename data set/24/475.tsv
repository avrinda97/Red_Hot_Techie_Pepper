2011-08-08T02:24:00.000Z	samthewildone	YankDownUnder	no because its more of a ubuntu problem than mozilla

2011-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	I'm using FF5...."Show all bookmarks => Import and Backup => Export HTML
2011-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	samthewildone	YankDownUnder	let me check my friend !
2011-08-08T02:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Then it's either a FONT issue or you're using Unity. Either which, the font issue is usually fixable quickly. Unity? I don't do Unity because it's too infantile.
2011-08-08T02:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Log out, use "Classic Desktop", export your HTML, then go back to Infantile Unity.
2011-08-08T02:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Issue resolved.
2011-08-08T02:31:00.000Z	samthewildone	YankDownUnder	my dad is going to do that right now
2011-08-08T02:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Then buy yer dad a beer when it's done. Good boy.
2011-08-08T02:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Then buy him a case of beer.
2011-08-08T02:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Look mate, in all reality, Unity is still in it's infant stages, and it was meant for netbooks, not for desktops. Bad decision to push it to the public the way it was pushed. If I was y'all, I'd think about removing it all together - in order to keep a consistent usability environment, mate.
2011-08-08T02:33:00.000Z	samthewildone	YankDownUnder	Interesting...
2011-08-08T02:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	samthewildone	Just the facts, Jack.
