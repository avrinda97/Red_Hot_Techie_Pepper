2007-11-29T19:34:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	Should I? =P
2007-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	Yes, the -o outputorder=reversed   as a commandline option prints it in reverse order. For GUI I don't know
2007-11-29T19:40:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	Ok, thank you very much. On GUI, you just have to add outputorder, than set reversed as its value.
2007-11-29T19:41:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	You're welcome
2008-03-12T21:47:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	What module?
2008-03-12T21:48:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	I patched bcm43xx
2008-03-12T21:48:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	it's on ~/bcm43xx
2008-03-12T21:48:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	So you downloaded the source code for the bcm43xx driver, applied a patch so far?
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	yeah, just need to compile it
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	thing is, I don't know how to. make doesn't work.
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	Make sure you have build-essential installed
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	You may also need kernel headers installed
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	it's actually from a linux-source package, but I moved to  ~ so it could be easier editing
2008-03-12T21:49:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	I have them all.
2008-03-12T21:50:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	moving it from inside another build tree makes it problemmatic
2008-03-12T21:51:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	what should I do, then?
2008-03-12T21:51:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	get it back to kernel tree, then?
2008-03-12T21:51:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	Put it back in the source tree in /usr/src or where your tree is, then make only that module, or even all modules
2008-03-12T21:52:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	how to compile only bcm43xx module?
2008-03-12T21:54:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	is there someway? that's what is missing.
2008-03-12T21:55:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	I'm not sure you can specify one module to compile only. Usually it's more like: sudo make modules
2008-03-12T21:55:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	it's really a pain in the ass. :>
2008-03-12T21:56:00.000Z	genii	Lunks	Yes, it is
2008-03-12T21:57:00.000Z	Lunks	genii	guess I'll advert here looking for my answer. :)
