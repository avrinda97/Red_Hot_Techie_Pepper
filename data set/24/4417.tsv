2007-06-09T08:37:00.000Z	wobx		can anyone tell me why there's a chroot line in the PS1 variable? echo $PS1 ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$
2007-06-09T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	source the /etc/profile and echo that variabl
2007-06-09T08:39:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	same output - what does it say at your pc? # set |grep PS1
2007-06-09T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	I am not using ubuntu
2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	debian?
2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	no I mean to source it and echo the $debian_chroot thing
2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	yes i already did same output
2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	how could it be the same output
2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	the same output as what, as P1
2007-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	source does only reparse profile and reapply the variables..so the output of PS1 is the same as before doing source...
2007-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	no, source it and echo $debian_chroot
2007-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	now i got it wait a sec
2007-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	empty
2007-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	that is weird
2007-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	but strange anyhow
2007-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	well would be even weirder if it was set
2007-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	maybe if you chroot into something, it sets a debian_chroot variable and so you actually see the top of your directory as root instead of as whatever subdirectory you are actually in
2007-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	i know what a chroot is..
2007-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	right, maybe for some odd reason, when you chroot into something, it sets that variable and so instead of seeing /var/chroot assuming that is where you have setup the chroot, you just see /
2007-06-09T08:45:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	hm could be..could look at gentoo's profile. must be similar as you also source profile after chroot
2007-06-09T08:46:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	my ps1 is [\u@\h \W] \$
2007-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	wobx	bruenig	what distro?
2007-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	wobx	arch, it was the same in zenwalk too
