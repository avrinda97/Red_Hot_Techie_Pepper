2011-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	Tbruff13		yes i need help my grafics on my ubuntu 10.04 computer look blurry i think it is because of the video driver can some one help me
2011-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	well u need to tell everyone what video card it is
2011-08-03T10:16:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	i found the command and this is the video card Intel Corporation System Controller Hub (SCH Poulsbo) Graphics Controller (rev 07)
2011-08-03T10:18:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	yikes.. unfortunately that card isn't very well supported at least according to this "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Controller_Hub" .. perhaps there's bleeding edge code from intel.com if you're lucky..
2011-08-03T10:20:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	can you please help me get it out of low graphics mode please
2011-08-03T10:20:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	impossible.
2011-08-03T10:20:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	there's no support for it.
2011-08-03T10:30:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	there's a ppa for it.. but it's risky.. (add-apt-repository ppa:gma500/emgd) (sudo apt-get install xorg-emgd emgd-dkms emgd-xorg-conf)
2011-08-03T10:30:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	i got those commands from a french ubuntu wiki
2011-08-03T10:30:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	thanks ill try it
2011-08-03T10:30:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	as i said it's bleeding edge.. it can do anything like randomly freeze ur system or something..
2011-08-03T10:31:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	(remember i said its risky)
2011-08-03T10:31:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	if i upgrade to 11.04 will it fix it
2011-08-03T10:31:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	site source is http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/poulsbo
2011-08-03T10:33:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	if u're trying it.. also there's (emgd-xorg-conf) command to fire up..
2011-08-03T10:33:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	this is dual boot with windows so i am safe just tell me what might work
2011-08-03T10:33:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	it's getting more support as of 2.6.39.. so hope is not lost if you don't have it working yet..
2011-08-03T10:34:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	well most u can do is uninstall the driver.. and go back to slow graphics.. nothing seriously will get damaged...
2011-08-03T10:35:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	if i upgrade to 11.04 will that help
2011-08-03T10:35:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	but if u decide to try a bleeding edge kernel then you have to make sure grub boots it up and everything else works too afterwards (like sound etc)
2011-08-03T10:35:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	well i thought u were on 11.04.. so that site mentions 11.04..
2011-08-03T10:36:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	u can try upgrading to 11.04.. then afterwards add the ppa for the driver..
2011-08-03T10:36:00.000Z	yagoo	Tbruff13	see if everything works before trying the ppa
2011-08-03T10:39:00.000Z	Tbruff13	yagoo	when i upgrade do i go into the unity or classic gnome
