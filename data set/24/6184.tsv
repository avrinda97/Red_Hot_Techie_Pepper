2005-12-28T17:30:00.000Z	claes	alamba	sudo update-alternatives --config java
2005-12-28T17:31:00.000Z	alamba	claes	/usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj/bin/java is the option given...but that's not 1.5
2005-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	claes	alamba	it should read: /usr/lib/j2re1.5-sun/bin/java
2005-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	claes	alamba	Have you checked  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-12-28T17:32:00.000Z	alamba	claes	yep...somehow that just is'nt working for me...i'm trying the first option on that page...sudo apt-get install j2re1.4
2005-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	claes	alamba	Do the things under Sun java and it will work.
2005-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	alamba	claes	that's going to take a good 25 min to download on my connection, meanwhile is there anything I can do to get the already installed 1.5 to work?
2005-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	alamba	claes	ok...trying
2005-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	alamba	claes	cp: cannot create regular file `/usr/java/sun-j2re1.5_1.5.0+update05_i386.deb': Permission denied
2005-12-28T17:41:00.000Z	claes	alamba	Why are you copying it there?
2005-12-28T17:42:00.000Z	alamba	claes	does it matter that i'm running the bin file from within /usr/java ?
2005-12-28T17:43:00.000Z	claes	alamba	Yes try it in /tmp instead.
2005-12-28T17:47:00.000Z	alamba	claes	it worked!!!!!!!!!! thanks so much!!
