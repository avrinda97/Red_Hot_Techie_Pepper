2006-10-04T15:04:00.000Z	dibblego		when I boot off the live CD I get a message "ipw3945 Radio Frequency Kill Switch is on" and my wireless card is not available -- wtf is that?
2006-10-04T15:04:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	check your BIOS?
2006-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	but I haven't touched the bios -- it was working fine
2006-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	with Ubuntu?
2006-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	yes
2006-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	then i suggest you look around in the BIOS and in Windows to see if anything changed.
2006-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	I just switched it on today and got that message for some reason, so I tried the live CD and saw that message
2006-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	I don't run windows, but ok thanks
2006-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	you switched what on today?
2006-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	the machine
2006-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	manufacturer?
2006-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	Dell
2006-10-04T15:09:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	have you contacted them to find out what they do to the 3945 to possibly cause that message? because i have a Thinkpad with a 3945 and have never seen anything like that.
2006-10-04T15:09:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	that message comes from ubuntu during the boot of the live CD
2006-10-04T15:10:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	then the wireless card simply isn't there
2006-10-04T15:10:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	right, and what causes Ubuntu to believe that that situation is the case?
2006-10-04T15:10:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	no idea - nothing changed as far as I can tell
2006-10-04T15:11:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	which is why i mentioned contacting Dell to see how their firmware interacts with that device.
2006-10-04T15:11:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	ok thanks
2006-10-04T15:13:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	I think I may have figured it out :)
2006-10-04T15:13:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	suave
2006-10-04T15:13:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	I have pressed one of those Fn+<something> buttons
2006-10-04T15:14:00.000Z	mneptok	dibblego	Don't Do That(tm)
2006-10-04T15:14:00.000Z	dibblego	mneptok	yep, my wireless is back - thanks for the tips
