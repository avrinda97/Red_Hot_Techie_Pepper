2007-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren		Anyone?  Windows XP as a VM in Ubuntu?
2007-03-27T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 you need an image, to make a image of an xp installation you need at least vmware server,  you can get thaty from the vmware site,
2007-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	Is it... free?
2007-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 it was , but you needed an elaborate registration
2007-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	  #vmware is a better place for this stuff
2007-03-27T08:37:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	Okey doke, thanks!
2007-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 if you want my advice,  before setting up a virtual machine try to run your app in wine ,  much less trouble
2007-03-27T08:39:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	Dude... I am SO TIRED of running crap in wine.
2007-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	wine fails, okay?  It's a great, valiant effort, and I'm sure it works fine for some people, but it fails.
2007-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 I was just trying to save you some trouble
2007-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 you could also try this http://www.advicesource.org/ubuntu/Run_Existing_Windows_Instalation_On_Ubuntu_With_Vmware_player.html
2007-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	I understand.  It's just that you can only be told to "try the GIMP" and "what about wine" so many times!
2007-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 but it didn't work for me
2007-03-27T08:41:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	Unfortunately, I blasted my Windows partition
2007-05-09T05:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 with iptable i would expect but donT' ask me how
2007-05-09T05:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	check in the forum   www.ubuntuforums.com
2007-05-09T06:00:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	There doesn't seem to be any information on how to open ports, or why all ports would be closed
2007-05-09T06:02:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 did you consider this might be a router issue ? or even some trick by your isp ?
2007-05-09T06:02:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	When Apache is on, the remote machine can Telnet to port 80 on my local machine
2007-05-09T06:03:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	In fact, any port that I specify to listen on in Apache can be accessed remotely
2007-05-09T06:03:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	However, that's the only way I can successfully open a port to a remote machine
2007-05-09T06:03:00.000Z	Tonren	Pelo	There's something that Apache is doing, that my script isn't, that's preventing my script from listening to remote clients
2007-05-09T06:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	 try asking in #iptables
2007-05-09T06:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Tonren	or try in #apache
