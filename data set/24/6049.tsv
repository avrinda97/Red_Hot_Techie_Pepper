2006-02-23T09:53:00.000Z	vwguy337		JD: i'm in sort of the same position you are...i'm frustrated with winblows, but i have to keep it around...  :-(
2006-02-23T09:54:00.000Z	vwguy337		JS: BUT...i will say this...the wireless works in XP, not in Ubuntu...
2006-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	what card?
2006-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	acx111 chipset on linksys w54g pcmcia
2006-02-23T09:55:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	that has no linux support?
2006-02-23T09:56:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	got the linux box d/l'ing everything...but i can't find the damn kernel source...lol
2006-02-23T09:56:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	no...it's the stupid proprietary acx111 chipset
2006-02-23T09:56:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	yeah, wifi is the new winmodem *sigh*
2006-02-23T09:57:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	too true...but i'll get it working...just have to rebuild the kernel...after i find the damn source code...heh
2006-02-23T09:58:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	what do you mean, 'find it' ?
2006-02-23T09:59:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	it's not in /usr/src/
2006-02-23T09:59:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	dpkg -L <package_name> will list files installed by a package
2006-02-23T09:59:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	it's not a package, unfortunately
2006-02-23T10:00:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	are you running am ubuntu kernel?
2006-02-23T10:00:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	yes...2.6.12-10-386
2006-02-23T10:01:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	then you should use the equiv. source package, unless you want to build your own kernel
2006-02-23T10:02:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	that's the problem...there is no package...it's all a custom build...check out acx100.sf.net
2006-02-23T10:03:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	what is a custom build? the module? will it only build against a perticular kernel version?
2006-02-23T10:04:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	no...since the drivers for the linksys card are proprietary, people have been reverse-engineering them...so it's a custom thing you have to build into the kernel...no packages are out there for it...afaik
2006-02-23T10:06:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	no, but you need the source for your running kernel to build it against
2006-02-23T10:07:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	exactly...guess i am going to have to d/l the src...
2006-02-23T10:07:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	yeah, use apt-get to install the source for your running kernel
2006-02-23T10:08:00.000Z	vwguy337	amphi	ok...that's something i'm not sure on how to do...
2006-02-23T10:08:00.000Z	amphi	vwguy337	uname -r will give you the version of the running kernel; apt-cache search kernel source will show all the available kernel source packages
