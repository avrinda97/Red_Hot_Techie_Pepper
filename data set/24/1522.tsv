2009-12-01T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	I only came in lately - please restate your problem - if possible all in one line
2009-12-01T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	we neither sell it nor do we make it - we merely give support to fellows needing help - so stop your "threatening"
2009-12-01T01:23:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	threatening ??? i am not threatening . i'am just saying my state . dear friend , i love the ubuntu philosophy and have been using ubuntu for about two months . all these time , i had many probs and with the help of guys like you , i fixed 'em and  learned a lot . but now the system doesn't boot and i've no clue of what to do . i've a project to complete and my state is really pathetic . i hope u understand :)
2009-12-01T01:25:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	when i boot , the system stays at the ubuntu logo . no change from there . dats my problem
2009-12-01T01:26:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	can you get to the grub menu and start recovery mode?
2009-12-01T01:27:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	the grub menu comes . but the recovery mode also stucks at a line saying smthng like choice 1 or smthng like dat
2009-12-01T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	please be more specific - the wording of error messages is often important
2009-12-01T01:28:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	but to do that i need to reboot . i'm now from live cd . can i show u some log file or smthng ??
2009-12-01T01:30:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	sorry, I'm a bit too tired for "double remote" debugging
2009-12-01T01:48:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	 i rebooted . may i give the exact line at which the system stops when run in recovery mode  ???
2009-12-01T01:49:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	that would be helpful - if it is more than 3 lines please use !pastebin
2009-12-01T01:51:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	 here is the last two lines : "Begin : waiting for root file system  .... [2.775135] usb 1-7 configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice"
2009-12-01T01:55:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	the last line seems harmless - but we would need the lines before that - another question: what did you do with your system before the problem surfaced?
2009-12-01T01:58:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	nothing special . two things i remember are : 1. deleted two users & 2. used cpu-freqscaling applet in the gnome panel
2009-12-01T02:00:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	no I was asking more about things like: add/remove a HD, remove LVM, ....
2009-12-01T02:01:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	no apart from deleting two users , i didnt' do anything with the hardware or any other major changes
2009-12-01T02:03:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	sorry, today thats the end of my possibilities - gotta have some shut eye :)
2009-12-01T02:03:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	 here are a few last lines from my /var/log/messages : http://pastebin.com/m593b551a
2009-12-01T02:05:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	okey . thnx for helping nyway . i think i 've to switch back to win (not threatening okey ;) ) coz i've to do a project . thnx buddy
2009-12-01T02:06:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	nothing strange  I can see here - sorry that we missed it - good luck
2009-12-01T02:07:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	 one last question . could deleting two users 've caused this ? ny possibility ??
2009-12-01T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	I cannot imagine how - so I'd say "no" - my guess would rather be a wrong line in the grub config pointing to the "root" device
2009-12-01T02:10:00.000Z	karmicuser	guntbert	i dont find any menu.lst file in grub directory in karmic . what is the new configuration file name ?
2009-12-01T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	karmicuser	please look in /boot/grub/grub.cfg, right in the beginning is stated where the real config sits
