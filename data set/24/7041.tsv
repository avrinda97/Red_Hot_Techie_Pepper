2005-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	Zerboxx		(cd drive)
2005-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	nakata	Zerboxx	unmount it
2005-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	nakata		umount /media/cdrom0
2005-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	Zerboxx		:) command not found
2005-05-09T16:07:00.000Z	nakata		sudo
2005-05-09T16:07:00.000Z	Zerboxx		did that
2005-05-09T16:07:00.000Z	nakata		check again
2005-05-09T16:07:00.000Z	nakata		it's: /bin/umount <mount path>
2005-05-09T16:08:00.000Z	Zerboxx		oh geez, I was putting uNmount, my mistake :)
2005-05-09T16:08:00.000Z	nakata		right-o :P
2005-05-09T16:08:00.000Z	Zerboxx		Nakata: says it's not mounted, tried /media/cdrom0, and /dev/hda
2005-05-09T16:09:00.000Z	nakata	Zerboxx	certain your cdrom is on hda?
2005-05-09T16:09:00.000Z	nakata		that's your primary master disc, isn't it?
2005-05-09T16:10:00.000Z	Zerboxx	nakata	I was pretty sure, when I -d1'd it, dvd's play smoother
2005-05-09T16:10:00.000Z	nakata		euh
2005-05-09T16:10:00.000Z	nakata		well, if you're sure it's not mounted then, i suggest a paperclip in the 'force eject' hole on the front
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	nakata		but i doubt it's actually unmounted
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	nakata		fwiw
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	Zerboxx	nakata	Ok, I'll try that after a restart
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	Zerboxx	nakata	thanks :)
2005-05-09T16:11:00.000Z	nakata		hehe
2005-05-09T16:12:00.000Z	nakata		yukkuri!
2005-05-09T16:13:00.000Z	Zerboxx	nakata	restarted, and it's as good as new :)
