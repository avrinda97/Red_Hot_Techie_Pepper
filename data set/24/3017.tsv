2009-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	harpreet		abey o matthai
2009-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	sure, they are ok, depends on config and designated resources
2009-04-02T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	games run badly, the new virtualbox has an opengl implementation but ive not heard anything
2009-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	hmw_: I want to run some office applications such as simply accounting etc. for a client, i want to make sure client does not lose data.
2009-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	then it'll be fine, does the app not run via wine?
2009-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	It is too slow in wine
2009-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	then try a virtualbox
2009-04-02T14:26:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	hmw_: thank you very much
2009-04-02T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	you will be installing windows on linux so you will need a license
2009-04-02T14:27:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	License for windows right?
2009-04-02T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	yes as you will be installing it to th VM
2009-04-02T14:27:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	wouldn't that license that originally came with their pc, when it was factory installed, work?
2009-04-02T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	depends on the license you bought, windows licenses are weird
2009-04-02T14:28:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	true
2009-04-02T14:28:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	then i'll have to investigate on it
2009-04-02T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	sounds like it, did you get wine from the wine repo
2009-04-02T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	it seems slicker than the one on the ubuntu repo imho
2009-04-02T14:29:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	I got it from ubuntu repo, should have tried other way
2009-04-02T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	http://www.winehq.org/download/deb
2009-04-02T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	this may give better performance of the app
2009-04-02T14:32:00.000Z	harpreet	ActionParsnip	thank you, i'm checking
2011-02-20T04:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harpreet	sunbird maybe
