2005-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	Klondike		Hmm, yeah, this site also says that Breezy's driver for e1000 is outdated
2005-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	Klondike		http://blog.dataloss.nl/perma/ubuntu-510-breezy-on-dell-dimension-9150/
2005-12-27T12:51:00.000Z	Klondike		And it provides a compiled e1000.ko driver
2005-12-27T12:51:00.000Z	Klondike		But how do I get the Ubuntu installer to use this?
2005-12-27T12:52:00.000Z	Klondike		Will wget work though?  It's my network card that's not being recognized
2005-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	Klondike		I'm on my current Windows installation
2005-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	Klondike		Which I am intending to wipe when I install Ubuntu
2005-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	Klondike		hmm
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	Klondike		I don't have a floppy drive
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	Klondike		My other hard disk needs an IDE->SATA driver...well, I have an iPod ;)
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	pagan	Klondike	i'm sorry ignore my smart(_!_) was j/k
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	Klondike		That's the only USB drive I have right now
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	Klondike		I could try to find someone's to borrow though.
2005-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	Klondike	pagan	:)
2005-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	Klondike		Do you think my iPod would be recognized as a USB drive?
2005-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	pagan	Klondike	just glad you have a sense "O" humor...some don't ouch *ducks* "QUACK"
2005-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	Klondike		Heh
2005-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	Klondike		Yeah
2005-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	Klondike		I could do that
2005-12-27T12:57:00.000Z	Klondike		I could strip the one from my older computer
2005-12-27T12:57:00.000Z	Klondike		Now don't laugh at this, but do you mean recompiling the kernel?
2005-12-27T12:57:00.000Z	Klondike		And...is that difficult?
2005-12-27T12:57:00.000Z	Klondike		I'm familair with Linux/Unix systems but I've never recompiled the kernel
2005-12-27T12:58:00.000Z	pagan	Klondike	that is what I would do. I had some crazy 3com clone card made in japan and could not for life of me get it installed..$20 later I got smart :)
