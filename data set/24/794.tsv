2011-02-02T04:06:00.000Z	Da|Mummy		i have a cheap usb hub, how can i figure out if its usb1.1 or usb2?
2011-02-02T04:07:00.000Z	Da|Mummy		i dont have windows
2011-02-02T04:08:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  not sure   you could try    sudo dmidecode
2011-02-02T04:08:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  that show it
2011-02-02T04:12:00.000Z	Da|Mummy	coz_	i see 38 structures, some of them are usb related, none of them give me any info on speed of usb
2011-02-02T04:12:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 darn I thought for sure it would
2011-02-02T04:14:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  try  hwinfo
2011-02-02T04:15:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  or with  dmidecode then google the motherboard for its specs
2011-02-02T04:16:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  the hub itself is neither one
2011-02-02T04:17:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  believe it or not its not the wireing that makes it usb or 2
2011-02-02T04:17:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  the hub "should" respond to whichever your system has
2011-02-02T04:18:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 ok your system supports and uses usb 21
2011-02-02T04:18:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 rather usb2
2011-02-02T04:20:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  I have had hubs that were low end and didnt work
2011-02-02T04:21:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  you system is already usb2  ,,,  it is most likely the hub... does the usb ports on the computer work?
2011-02-02T04:21:00.000Z	Da|Mummy	coz_	yes
2011-02-02T04:22:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 ok  then if the hub ,,, plugged into one of the system ports...isnt working,,,then the hub is bad
2011-02-02T04:23:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  what do you have plugged into it?
2011-02-02T04:23:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 I believe it is  18megs a second
2011-02-02T04:26:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  the hub itslelf is not 1 or 2
2011-02-02T04:26:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	  does the drive write faster if it is plugged into the system port
2011-02-02T04:31:00.000Z	Da|Mummy	coz_	well i was able to figure out with disk utility that it is a usb1.1 with 12mb/sec connection :{
2011-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 open ccsm  click on the unity plugin
2011-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	coz_	Da|Mummy	 I believe if you set that to "Never"  it stays on the deskto
