2006-01-15T10:58:00.000Z	AcidReign		actually there maybe a non-commercial tool for it
2006-01-15T10:58:00.000Z	AcidReign		but I cant think of one
2006-01-15T10:59:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	to my knowledge, there is none
2006-01-15T11:02:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	if you do it properly, it's ok
2006-01-15T11:03:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	"do it properly" ?
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	in a terminal type "man apt-get"
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	that's useless
2006-01-15T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	advise "checkinstall" instead of 'make install' please
2006-01-15T11:05:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	1) my HD is completely full, so man errors, 2) that wont tell me if its safe to rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb
2006-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	look to deleting things in your /tmp and your browser and other personal caches first
2006-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	/tmp is 18K
2006-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	and I KNOW this is the problem apt JUST ate over 600MB
2006-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	what is in ~/.stuff  ?
2006-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	No such file or directory
2006-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	please use your head. ~/.EXAMPLE_FOLDER
2006-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	well I've actually seen things use such names. so its not unreasonable to assume you were being literal
2006-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	and besides my entire home directory is only a few MB
2006-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	sudo apt-get clean
2006-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	Thank You, that cleared over 530MB.
2006-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	just wiping things that don't belong to you (the user) causes trouble.
2006-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	so does having 0 free space
2006-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	and it seems that did exactly what I wanted to do manually...
2006-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	nalioth	AcidReign	it did more than you think
2006-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	AcidReign	nalioth	I know that
