2008-02-29T10:47:00.000Z	Bidou		I'v a problem with mysql-server when I type the commande: mysql -uroot /// ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
2008-02-29T10:48:00.000Z	Bidou		and it didn't ask me for set up my password when I installed it
2008-02-29T10:50:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	have you tried reconfiguring mysql-server? Use dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server
2008-02-29T10:52:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	i tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server // and the shell said anythings and the command mysql -uroot don't work again
2008-02-29T10:53:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	it sounds like you were NOT asked for the root password again during the reconfigure, right?
2008-02-29T10:53:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	exactly but i don't know how i can set up this password
2008-02-29T10:54:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	have you tried purging the package and reinstalling?
2008-02-29T10:55:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	just "apt-get purge mysql-server" should do it
2008-02-29T10:57:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	ok, i do what you said, but whan i reinstall it, i had the same problem, it didn't ask me for set up my root password, and it automatically shut down
2008-02-29T10:58:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	shut down the mysql server, I hope, not the whole computer?
2008-02-29T10:59:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	yeah just the mysql-server
2008-02-29T11:00:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	the mysql-server is a meta package and it installs another package, for my that was mysql-server-5.0, same for you?
2008-02-29T11:01:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	yeah me too it's mysql-server 5.0
2008-02-29T11:02:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	I just verified in my synaptic and it's the mysql-server 5.0
2008-02-29T11:03:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	I'm just starting up a vmware instance of ubuntu which doesn't have mysql-server installed and I'll install it just to check what happens - what release of ubuntu are you running?
2008-02-29T11:04:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon
2008-02-29T11:07:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	my VM is not behaving ... it'll be a couple more minutes
2008-02-29T11:07:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	ok thank you for your help
2008-02-29T11:13:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	after downloading the packages, the first thing it asked for was to set the root password, so I have no idea why it is not working for you - is your system up-to-date?
2008-02-29T11:14:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	yep my system is up to date, i don't know why on my ubuntu that doesn't work oO
2008-02-29T11:16:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	have you checked your logs?
2008-02-29T11:17:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	 my logs on my shell ?? Dépaquetage de mysql-server (à partir de .../mysql-server_5.0.45-1ubuntu3.1_all.deb) ...//  * Stopping MySQL database server mysqld  [ OK ] /// Paramétrage de mysql-server (5.0.45-1ubuntu3.1) ...
2008-02-29T11:18:00.000Z	googlingtingwana	Bidou	I think I've run out of ideas ... sorry
2008-02-29T11:19:00.000Z	Bidou	googlingtingwana	thanks a lot for help me, i'll try to fix the problem later
