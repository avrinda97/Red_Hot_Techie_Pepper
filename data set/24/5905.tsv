2006-06-12T16:43:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	dapper has a few bugs, but i definitely prefer it to breezy
2006-06-12T16:44:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	everything seemed to stay there for me
2006-06-12T16:44:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	i only got 2 things in it now TT_TT
2006-06-12T16:45:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	are you the admin user or not?
2006-06-12T16:45:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	Yush i am the only user and the admin
2006-06-12T16:45:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	are you a member of the admin group? i know dapper will hide most of that menu for users who are not
2006-06-12T16:46:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	Yush i am! x.x
2006-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	maybe a good idea, but the amount of users that want options during install for various things like ui changes and all..... it would make an install last over an hour getting through the options
2006-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	Not so at all they could have a option list at the very begining what to update what not to check the box's you wanna update
2006-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	were you wondering where Applications --> System Tools had gone?
2006-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	yeah my menu went POOF and my shutdown menu is stupifyed with a XP feel
2006-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	for me that menu has disappeared totally, i thought you were talking about System --> Administration (sry) but most of the things in it have been farmed out to other menus
2006-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	and the few things that have disappeared totally can easily be reenabled by editin gthe mensu
2006-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	i was honestly thinking of wiping my HD and installing 5.10 then doing what i need to do and make a custom CD tho i still have no concept of wtf a custom CD alows to be custums
2006-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	a custom cd allows you to customize the filesystem that is zapped onto the live cd, thats all i think
2006-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	Idk i really want to make my own settings and everything
2006-06-12T05:00:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	i think you can, although you might need a quite indepth knowledge of the fs arrangements, as customizing a live cd basically gives you a terminal iwth the fs that will go on the cd, and you can then change what you want through the terminal, but thats it... no gui to see what will happen :(
2006-06-12T05:00:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	Matthewv	Im to Noobalishus for that TT_TT
2006-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	Matthewv	Angel_Dex	I couldn't do it properly atm
