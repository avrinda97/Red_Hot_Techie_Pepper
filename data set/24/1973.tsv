2010-01-15T04:53:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	Well, could you translate that? By now, you should be able to play DVDs (Unless there are errors as you mentioned).

2010-01-15T04:53:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	I'm using Google Translate. :)
2010-01-15T04:54:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	Have you restarted VLC since you ran the script?
2010-01-15T04:55:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	Is libdvdcss2 installed?
2010-01-15T04:56:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	I don't think it was. Do "sudo aptitude install libdvdcss2" and run "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh" again.
2010-01-15T04:56:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	kinja-sheep	it was, but i unninstalled it to reinstall it again, but i couldn't find it anymore

2010-01-15T05:00:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	And you know this for fact that your machine are capable of playing DVDs?
2010-01-15T05:01:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	kinja-sheep	hehe yes yes
2010-01-15T05:01:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	kinja-sheep	i would kill myself if that was the problem
2010-01-15T05:01:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	You borked it. :(
2010-01-15T05:02:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	I don't know what else I could suggest. Did you did something recently that cause this? bork = broke
2010-01-15T05:05:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	I can't help anymore. I'm out of ideas. Install few packages + VLC and run the script usually get the job done for me.
2010-01-15T05:06:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Um_cara_qualquer	You could try enabling the Medibuntu repo and get updated packages. Try different DVDs (as alteregoa could be right).
