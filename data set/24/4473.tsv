2007-10-16T13:30:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	do other wine programs have sound?
2007-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	do other things' sound work under wine? did you enable alsa in wineconfig?
2007-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	I've tried everything possible to make the sound work under wine with WoW...  but there's a problem with Blizzard new sound management and Sound blaster's cards apparently (on the Creative web site) for now I'm trying to make the sound work from my motherboard!!
2007-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	does the soudn work outside of wine?
2007-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	: Nope
2007-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	lsmod | grep snd

2007-10-16T13:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	it looks like its loading your sound card's drivers, are you sure your not muted?
2007-10-16T13:12:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	I used to have a SoundBlaster card that was working and I decided to shutdown my computer, remove the card and reboot!!  Is it possible that Ubuntu is still loading the drivers from my SoundBlaster card?
2007-10-16T13:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	it doesnt look like a soundblaster card though
2007-10-16T13:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	lsmod | grep Audio
2007-10-16T13:13:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	Done, didn't return anything though!
2007-10-16T13:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	hrm...
2007-10-16T13:15:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	: WARNING: you should run this program as super-user.
2007-10-16T13:17:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	Well I have no card, I'm just trying to use the sound from the motherboard!!  Is there a way to configure that?  I have a pretty standard motherboard I'm sure Asus A8N
2007-10-16T13:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	it should automatically pick it up, maybe issue these two commands: dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base   and    dpkg-reconfigure alsa-utils
2007-10-16T13:19:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	: I'll check what studdock suggested, then I'll try your suggestions...  brb
2007-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	It wasn'T activated in Bios...  now the sound works in Ubuntu...  but WoW still has no sound!!!  :(
2007-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	Lemme triple verify, but I use Ventrilo on wine and it works fine!
2007-10-16T13:34:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	: Ya, other wine programs have sound
2007-10-16T13:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Metal03	i dont know why wow wouldnt have sound then, is it some option in the program somewhere?
2007-10-16T13:37:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	It used to not detect any sound device I think...  but I'll verify that AGAIN!!  hehehe
2007-10-16T13:39:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	: Ya...  it's like WoW doesn't see any sound devices...  when I go into the menu, the "sound input" is greyed out!
2007-10-16T13:40:00.000Z	Metal03	MasterShrek	Alright...  thanks anyways!!
