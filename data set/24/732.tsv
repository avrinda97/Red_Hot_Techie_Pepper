2011-02-18T07:01:00.000Z	AegisX		Hi guys; I'm looking to use a separate drive as my home folder. Is there anyway to point the home folder subfolders to counterparts on the separate drive?
2011-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	sure, use a symbolic link
2011-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Ah; and then delete the folders in the home drive?
2011-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	yes
2011-02-18T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	well I guess you would have to delete first :P
2011-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Thanks, that's a pretty functional way of doing it haha.
2011-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	So I guess the command would be "ln -s <blah>" right?
2011-02-18T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	do you just want to move your current home to a new partition? When I read your question, I thought you knew how to do that but now wanted to have a couple of directories under your HOME still point to the original drive.  Can you explain what you want to do?
2011-02-18T07:04:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Basically what I want to do is to have a documents and music folder on a separate hard drive that is also accessible by my Windows partition.
2011-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	That partition is NTFS
2011-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	then just do it with symlinks
2011-02-18T07:05:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Thanks again, jrib
2011-02-18T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	the syntax is: ln -s TARGET NAME
2011-02-18T07:06:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Roger; thanks
2011-02-18T07:19:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Thanks :)
2011-03-13T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	I had to replace one once... not very hard.  This is a question for ##hardware though, not ubuntu related
2011-03-13T16:00:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	Ah, thanks. Didn't know there was a channel such as that. Will ask there.
2011-03-13T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	##hardware, not #hardware.
2011-03-13T16:07:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	That doesn't work at all
2011-03-13T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	sure it does.  But you do need to be registered and identified to join the channel
2011-03-13T16:08:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	How do I register?
2011-03-13T16:09:00.000Z	AegisX	jrib	thanks!
2011-08-04T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	you don't need to uninstall it, just install the wm you want and choose it at the login screen
2011-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	jrib	AegisX	no
