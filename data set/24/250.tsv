2012-02-12T02:41:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	its a folder that constains the templates for a new users initial files like .bashrc and .profile
2012-02-12T03:33:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	su username
2012-02-12T11:35:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	chown doesnt change permission bits it changes ownership. chmod changes the permission bits
2012-02-12T11:37:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE..
2012-02-12T11:38:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	why are you trying to change the group to "account" and is the file really named "root"
2012-02-12T11:39:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	it would be chown root filename or chown root:root filename or chown root:someothergroup filename
2012-02-12T11:46:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	unprivileged users cant just chown files to root
2012-02-12T11:49:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	and what error message did it give you
2012-03-05T07:44:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	its a public ftp directory? what is the context for this question
2012-03-05T08:15:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	unzip
2012-03-05T08:16:00.000Z	sun_devil	escott	unzip filename?
2012-03-05T08:16:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	yes it will create filename/ with the contents of the zip
2012-03-05T08:22:00.000Z	sun_devil	escott	Can I open a zip and then read it in the vi editor?
2012-03-05T08:26:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	sure unzip and then open the file in vi?
2012-03-05T08:31:00.000Z	sun_devil	escott	what command would you use,  I tried upzip it gave a paragraph about central filename version?
2012-03-05T08:31:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	i just do unzip filename.zip
2012-03-05T08:38:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	sounds like it is asking if you want to replace a file in that folder with the one in the zip
2012-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	escott	sun_devil	gnucash
