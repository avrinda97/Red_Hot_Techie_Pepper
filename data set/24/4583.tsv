2007-03-03T16:52:00.000Z	r3factored		here are the errors I get when running winecfg - i installed the ubuntu edgy package from winehq. http://www.shortText.com/4zjl8c
2007-03-03T16:52:00.000Z	r3factored		and have made sure there are no others versions installed.
2007-03-03T16:52:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	I would install it via automatix
2007-03-03T16:53:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	ok i have that i will try thanks
2007-03-04T17:18:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	i removed wine and installed via automatrix2 and get the same errors on starting winecfg

2007-03-04T17:20:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	what are you trying to run?
2007-03-04T17:20:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	winecfg for the first time
2007-03-04T17:20:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	you could always just run windows virtually with VMware
2007-03-04T17:20:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	yeah i know buy vmware server is heavy maybe ill try crossover
2007-03-04T17:20:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	it should work unless you are trying to play games
2007-03-04T17:21:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	no just windows apps - ive used it before
2007-03-04T17:22:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	that is the only way i could get it to work smooth or at all
2007-03-04T17:22:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	ok thanks for the info - im bailing on wine and going with crossover or wmware
2007-03-04T17:22:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	???
2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	sorry..have you just tried running it straight
2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	r3factored	godofredo07	no
2007-03-04T17:23:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	just right click on it and say run with wine?
2007-03-04T17:24:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	try it because i have to go real quick and want to see what happens :)
2007-03-04T17:24:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	it might just work... :)
2007-03-04T17:24:00.000Z	godofredo07	r3factored	or not!
