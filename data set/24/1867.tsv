2011-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	rhin0		xubuntu10.04.2 doesn't appear to be able to configure dual screens -- I remember xubuntu10.04.0 does -- am I correct?  I am ditching 11.04 because of unity desktop/compiz desktop it freezes up everywhere -- unity desktop/compiz have given me the only problems I have ever had with ubuntu and is the reason I cannot use 11.04 on a desktop
2011-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	rhin0		ditching it -- 11.04 unuseable for many people because of a bit of eye candy
2011-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	rhin0		I know -- even with classic the desktop still freezes
2011-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	rhin0		having to go to xfce -- 11.04 only seems to run satisfactorily on a laptop not on a desktop with ati radeon I think card
2011-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	I'll bet it's something to do with the graphics + the version of compiz....
2011-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Hence why I'm sticking to 10.10 for most applications and usages...
2011-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Right oh...then 10.04 or 10.10 is yer baby!
2011-06-25T09:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	You should be able to force your graphics from the terminal/console: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2011-06-25T09:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	To get yer nvidia happy; and possibly resolve some issues that have cropped up between the chair and the keyboard...
2011-06-25T09:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	What I'm getting at is that it's most likely NOT the Gnome window mangler mate...
2011-06-25T09:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	...and there shouldn't BE any issues with an nVidia card...
2011-06-25T09:35:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Here's something for ya to try. Tell me when you're game to listen.
2011-06-25T09:37:00.000Z	rhin0	YankDownUnder	I AM GAME TO LISTEN.
2011-06-25T09:37:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Right oh, firstly, hit CTRL+ATL+F1, that should take you to a console login. Login as the root user (or yourself, whatever). Secondly, stop GDM. Do so with /etc/init.d/gdm stop. Wait. Then, as  you're at the console, type: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg => and find the nvidia driver you want. Let the system do what it's going to do. THEN, restart GDM with /etc/init.d/gdm restart. That should take you BACK to your
2011-06-25T09:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Don't reckon I'm going anywhere until I have to pick up the missus.
2011-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	South of Sydney...in The Shire.
2011-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	rhin0	YankDownUnder	i miss it :(
2011-06-25T09:40:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Great place to live mate.
2011-06-25T09:41:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Cronulla = 5 minutes east. Bondi = 30 min north. ;)
2011-06-25T09:43:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Roger that.
2011-06-25T09:55:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	Let the system do all the "installing updates" and all that jazz - and after it's completely complete, and you've rebooted, lessee how that goes, eh?
2011-06-25T10:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	rhin0	In a short tick...
2011-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	rhin0	YankDownUnder	hi -- typing sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -- just goes back to the bash prompt without doing anything
2011-06-25T11:45:00.000Z	rhin0	YankDownUnder	researched this a bit -- from what I can tell the nvidia proprietary drivers have been superceded --- installing 'nv' or 'nouveau' 3d drivers -- from forum stuff I stand a chance -- will go with  that tomorrow ... btw "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" didn't do anything to reconfigure -- just returned to the bash prompt
