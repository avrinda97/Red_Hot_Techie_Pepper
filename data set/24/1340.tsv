2010-04-18T01:10:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- ok let me try both ...
2010-04-18T01:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	to remove the menu items System / Preferences / Main Menu - and remove/uncheck the wine stuff.  In your home directory you should have a .wine folder that contains all the wine settings as well as all the programs you installed using wine.
2010-04-18T01:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	the menu won't refresh until you A) log out/ back in or B) "killall gnome-panel"
2010-04-18T01:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	only 1 is required
2010-04-18T01:12:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- I tried "killall gnome-panel" in terminal - it's still there ...
2010-04-18T01:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	can't explain that.  Are you sure you removed them from Main Menu?
2010-04-18T01:14:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- OK, I tried that again and we're good.  Let me reinstall Wine - and then I have another question regarding Clamtk Virus Scanner ...
2010-04-18T01:17:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- so I reinstalled Wine.  How do I tell the program is working?  If I go the start menu now - and hit "Browse C-Drive" under the Wine menu - and nothing happens - is that bad sign?  Or is this happening just because I don't have any programs installed for Wine?
2010-04-18T01:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	"Browse C Drive" *should* open Nautilus (separate from any wine program)
2010-04-18T01:24:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	and trinikrono - OK, I just restarted and trying browing the C-Drive for Wine from the start menu - and still NOTHING ...
2010-04-18T01:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	sorry I don't have any suggestions sorry -- can you open nautilus and browse to ~/.wine/drive_c ?  CTRL+H to show hidden files BTW
2010-04-18T01:29:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- OK, I have Nautilus open - but I can't seem to find ~/.wine/drive_c.  "~" previous directories you need to drive through.  What are they?
2010-04-18T01:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	~ is your home directory
2010-04-18T01:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	look for Home
2010-04-18T01:32:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- yeah, so I'm in home --> peter_curry.  I don't see that .wine folder.  I did delete it before ...
2010-04-18T01:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	CTRL+H to show hidden files
2010-04-18T01:33:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	- yes, hidden files are already enabled ...
2010-04-18T01:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	run "wine" in a terminal will perhaps generate the .wine folder then
2010-04-18T01:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	to get my nic you can type "Zy<TAB>".  in terminal if the folder exists "cd ~/.wine"
2010-04-18T01:48:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	(and others):  Thanks for telling me how to populating nicknames faster.  That helps.  So I've tried all three: "cd .wine", "cd ~/.wine", and "nautilus wine" - and I don't the directory exists (even though I've reinstalled Wine).  So do I need to reinstall it or uninstall-install Wine again?
2010-04-18T01:49:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	(and others):  Again, I did delete the hidden .wine directory before installing Wine again ...
2010-04-18T01:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	see usser's suggestions above
2010-04-18T02:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peter_curry	basically the only reason to run virus scanning on linux is for the benefit of Windows users on other systems, that's it
2010-04-18T02:18:00.000Z	peter_curry	ZykoticK9	and that also makes total sense.  A virus we acquire on our computer may not affect our system, but then if it's e-mailed via a Windows client to a Windows user - they have a greater ability of being affected - especially if they are using an e-mail provider that does not have good antivirus protection built into their system (for example, Yahoo! is really good about this) ...
