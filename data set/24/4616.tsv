2007-02-25T08:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy	i'd say you need to change back whatever you messed around with
2007-02-26T07:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy	none at all.

2007-02-28T12:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy	cool, so you got it to the resolution you wanted?
2007-02-28T12:48:00.000Z	Shrimpy	IndyGunFreak	yes sir! the only thing wrong now is my sound card. It works but with only one application
2007-02-28T12:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Shrimpy	lol, if its not one thing its another, i'd make sure you take notes on what you're doing, maybe in a .doc file, and save them with your backups.., that way when you install feisty, or if you have some catastrophic failure and have to reinstall, you'll remember how to do it.
2007-02-28T12:51:00.000Z	Shrimpy	IndyGunFreak	yeah i actually been taking notes on these config files and things. (since i've reinstalled ubuntu a few times) i try and mak my friends swith and i'm pretty sure i sould get them set up
