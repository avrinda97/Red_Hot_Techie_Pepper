2005-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	foxgamer		Anyone able to help with getting libtcl8.4.so.0 seen by a program?
2005-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	yep
2005-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	I am trying to run a program that needs that file, but it says that it cannot find it.
2005-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	look in /usr/lib for libtcl8.4.so
2005-10-18T06:21:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	actually in /lib
2005-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	I have and it is there. I have also used ldconfig | grep libtcl and it is recognised.
2005-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	make a symlink to it
2005-10-18T06:22:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	Okaly. How do I do that?
2005-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	ln -s libtcl8.4.so /lib/libtcl8.4.so.0
2005-10-18T06:24:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	assuming your in that directory
2005-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	It says that the file already exists. Shall I delete this file (or move it) and do it again?
2005-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	what file?
2005-10-18T06:28:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	/lib/libtcl8.4.so.0
2005-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	then your program should find it
2005-10-18T06:29:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	That's what I thought. I shall try renaming the old file and doing it again and then reboot. See if it picks up on it.
2005-10-18T06:30:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	you could try symlinking it to /usr/lib
2005-10-18T06:31:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	Okay. Thank you. I'll give that a try first.
2005-10-18T06:46:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	I have managed to get it reading the file, but now I get 'cannot open share object file: error 40'
2005-10-18T06:46:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	thats too bad :-)
2005-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	So any ideas where I can go from here?
2005-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	not sure
2005-10-18T06:59:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	Okay. Thanks for your help though. I'll have a look/ask around and see if I can solve it
2005-10-18T07:28:00.000Z	foxgamer	SuseUX	Just thought I would let you know, the problem with libtcl that I've been having? It's actually a problem with the program. Typical! :)
2005-10-18T07:28:00.000Z	SuseUX	foxgamer	yer, tipical :-)
