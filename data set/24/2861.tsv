2008-08-27T01:23:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		shey> is there one?
2008-08-27T01:25:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		shey> I know the BIOS almost by heart: there is no optiont to do so.
2008-08-27T01:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		but I'm not sure that is the problem
2008-08-27T01:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		oh, and it says it can't find any updates
2008-08-27T01:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		actually... I just installed an update...
2008-08-27T01:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		for the kernel...
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		chubs> what you talking about?
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		what line to add where to do that?
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		with the ACPI options?
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		actually...
2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	see my above post
2008-08-27T01:38:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	tisk tisk
2008-08-27T01:40:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	oh alright, i guess i'll excuse it :P
2008-08-27T01:43:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	agreed, sounds like someone either totally new to computers or from mac os x (same thing right?)
2008-08-27T01:44:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	the backend yes. the gui tends to be completely different
2008-08-27T01:44:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	freebsd actually, but yeah similar
2008-08-27T01:45:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	try doing what i'm telling snip3r to do if you're having acpi problems, but it's not guaranteed to work for you
2008-08-27T01:47:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	no just adding it to the boot parameters for the kernel
2008-08-27T01:49:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	yeah?
2008-08-27T01:50:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	i mean you could use vim or something if you wanted to, but any text editor should do
2008-08-27T01:52:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	now add acpi=force to it
2008-08-27T01:54:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	did you save and update grub?
2008-08-27T01:55:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	run sudo update-grub
2008-08-27T02:09:00.000Z	chubs	SherlawkDragon	worked for snip3r, so perhaps for you too
