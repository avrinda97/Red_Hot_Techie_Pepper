2008-12-16T08:54:00.000Z	spanther		i can't read out my dvd :( it says error while reading from file: input/output error  :(
2008-12-16T08:55:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	if it's a movie, you might want to check out libdvdcss
2008-12-16T08:55:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	installed libdvdcss allready
2008-12-16T08:56:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	is there anything more to the error?
2008-12-16T08:56:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	its an input/output error
2008-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	is that all you get?
2008-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	maybe because of a hard copy protection
2008-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	yes
2008-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	do most other dvds work?
2008-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	depending on dvd
2008-12-16T08:58:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	maybe you don't have your dvd region set?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs

2008-12-16T08:59:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	follow link in previous post
2008-12-16T09:01:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	copying with sudo mc (midnight commander) showed "Input/output error (5)" too well lets check your page
2008-12-16T09:02:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	i didnt install libdvdread3 so far :-) maybe thats it?
2008-12-16T09:06:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	that would do it
2008-12-16T09:08:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	do i have to reboot after regionset ?
2008-12-16T09:08:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	i don't believe so
2008-12-16T09:09:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	nice i've set the region settings now and i can play it :D
2008-12-16T09:09:00.000Z	vaxius	spanther	enjoy
2008-12-16T09:10:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	my region setting was at "RPC Phase: II   type: NONE     Vendor resets available: 4  user controlled changes resets available: 5  drive plays discs from region(s):, mask=0xFF
2008-12-16T09:10:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	what is mask=0xFF for a region? my region 2 is mask=0xFFFFFFFD
2008-12-16T09:12:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	and my last question is. is this region setting now saved inside my disc drive or where is it stored? and is it stored forever?
2008-12-16T09:25:00.000Z	spanther	vaxius	are you still there?
