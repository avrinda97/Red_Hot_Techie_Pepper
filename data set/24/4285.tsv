2007-06-27T08:43:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Hey! I recently have been through the process of converting to using a single-boot of Ubuntu, instead of dual booting with Linux
2007-06-27T08:44:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		The one thing I really miss, is ALT code...
2007-06-27T08:44:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Does anyone know how I can use shortcuts like alt+<number> to make special characters/
2007-06-27T08:44:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		?
2007-06-27T08:44:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	as in third level keyboard codes?
2007-06-27T08:45:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	I don't know what you mean by that lol
2007-06-27T08:45:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	extended ascii characters?
2007-06-27T08:46:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	ctrl+alt, u, xxxx
2007-06-27T08:47:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	I don't quite understand what you mean
2007-06-27T08:47:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	press the ctrl key and the alt key at the same, then the u key, and then your character code.
2007-06-27T08:49:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	let me experiment, I just did this last week.
2007-06-27T09:04:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	right control+ right shift+ character code 
2007-08-20T11:07:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	the same way you do with winders, find the needed software, install it, and play with the camera.
2007-08-20T11:08:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	o_O well, I'm trying to get my Xbox Live vision camera workin, with Ubuntu, it should work, its just standard USB webcam, nothing special
2007-08-20T11:09:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	what is the make and model of the webcam? How you googled for the module(driver) linux needs for it?
2007-08-20T11:10:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	rofl its the Xbox Live Vision Camera (made for xbox 360) made by microsoft. Works fine plug & play in windows and mac, I haven't searched google, just wanted to prove a friend wrong
2007-08-20T11:10:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	Ok, glad this/I'm amusing, good luck!
2007-08-20T11:11:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	lol yeah, I was just gonna see if it would work.
2007-08-20T11:11:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	Sounds like cutting edge hardware, support maybe sparse now, with linux.
2007-08-20T11:12:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	lol not at all, its not that good, just wanted to see if it would work :)
2007-08-20T11:13:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	Roger that, if you can't find it here or on google, you have two options, wait, or write the software yourself.
2007-08-20T11:13:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	yeah, I'll google a bit if not whatever, I don't really need it
2007-08-20T11:14:00.000Z	n2diy	d4rkmonkey	Yep, good luck, and have fun.
2007-08-20T11:14:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	n2diy	I'll try ;)
