2010-01-05T22:03:00.000Z	mahngiel		need a bit of help here, i installed java, and created a link to the firefox/plugins, but no dice
2010-01-05T22:04:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	you need a java plugin, not a java interpreter, but dont you get a popup when you try to load the applet pointint you to what you need?
2010-01-05T22:05:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	no. i only got links to download jre6u17 with instructions to install it
2010-01-05T22:06:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	well i think i just installed ubuntu-restricted-extras and ended up with java support in the browser, you definitly do not have to create symlinks in any case
2010-01-05T22:07:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	well, if i go to about:plugins in firefox, there's no plugin info for java.
2010-01-05T22:08:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	do you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed?
2010-01-05T22:08:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	indeed
2010-01-05T22:12:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	there is a sun-java6-plugin - The Java(TM) Plug-in, Java SE 6
2010-01-05T22:12:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	you mind taking a look at this link?
2010-01-05T22:13:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	what link
2010-01-05T22:13:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1373145
2010-01-05T22:13:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	i have java installed, it's just not being picked up.. unless i bolo'd something
2010-01-05T22:14:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	well that is the way i used to install a plugin too
2010-01-05T22:14:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	what do you mean by 'output' ?
2010-01-05T22:15:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	if you open a console and type firefox it will typically output some stuff in the console while its running
2010-01-05T22:15:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	no, just opened a new clean browser
2010-01-05T22:19:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	why not try installing the plugin from the repo instead?
2010-01-05T22:19:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	which one?
2010-01-05T22:20:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	sun-java6-plugin
2010-01-05T22:20:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	ok, working on it. but i got an error telling me to 'dpkg --configure -a' due to an error ? o.O
2010-01-05T22:21:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	means an installation/update was previously interupted
2010-01-05T22:21:00.000Z	acicula	mahngiel	and thats how to fix it
2010-01-05T22:21:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	ya, it worked. just never seen that before
2010-01-05T22:32:00.000Z	mahngiel	acicula	thanks for solvin my issue
