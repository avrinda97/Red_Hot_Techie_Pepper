2009-12-12T10:25:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	this isn't really a ubuntu question is it
2009-12-12T10:26:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	i know, its just that ##java and #netbeans are as good as useless
2009-12-12T10:27:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	but i assume you are using ubuntu to do this operation
2009-12-12T10:27:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	yea
2009-12-12T10:27:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	so the real question is : what ubuntu packages can i install that let me create code documentation from my source code comments
2009-12-12T10:28:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	maybe
2009-12-12T10:28:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	if only you were using python...
2009-12-12T10:28:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	several keywords come to me at the moment : doxy & java-doc
2009-12-12T10:29:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	ok, i have javadoc and ant installed
2009-12-12T10:29:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	i wont be much help though since i don't know much about java
2009-12-12T10:30:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	not even that yet only javascrip,html,css and lua so far
2009-12-12T10:31:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	so you are a web developer, i was once their but i found more fun in linux which eventually brewed my interest in application programming
2009-12-12T10:32:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	have you looked at doxygen?
2009-12-12T10:32:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	whatever that is?
2009-12-12T10:32:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen
2009-12-12T10:34:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	im reading it, thanks for that link, looks quit helpful
2009-12-12T10:34:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	yes i think it is what you want to achieve
2010-06-13T15:03:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	why would you want to remove pulseaudio ?
2010-06-13T15:03:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	if its causing problems you're doing something wrong or following bad advice
2010-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	airtonix	i just wanted to be sure if its important, if not, flush it out of my startup apps
2010-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	why ?
2010-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	is it because of OCD
2010-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	airtonix	nmvictor	normally i just people on ignore that shout...
