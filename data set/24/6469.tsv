2006-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Has anyone tried creating an encrypted partition from the installer?
2006-11-20T08:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		What do you have to do to get a system to recognize new PCI cards you just put in?
2006-11-20T08:10:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	reboot, so it's picked up at startup?
2006-11-20T08:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Tried that
2006-11-20T08:10:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	lspci lists them?
2006-11-20T08:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Yep
2006-11-20T08:11:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	so what do you mean "work" then? what is the card?
2006-11-20T08:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Two are ethernet cards, one's a modem.  I'm not really worrying about the modem yet - just the others.  I'm hoping they'll show up in ifconfig
2006-11-20T08:12:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	they don't.
2006-11-20T08:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Was that a question or a statement?
2006-11-20T08:13:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	sorry, i thought there was a ? at the end. do they?
2006-11-20T08:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	No
2006-11-20T08:14:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	google for the cards and drivers? look at the Ubuntu hardware compatability list?
2006-11-20T08:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	They release source code even.  One of the two is listed as working on the wiki; the other isn't mentioned.
2006-11-20T08:18:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	hmmm i have no idea why they don't show up. see if a package (firmware etc) needs to be insatlled
2006-11-20T08:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	I'll poke around.  btw, dmesg has lines for each of them, giving designators of eth1 and eth2, and MAC addresses
2006-11-20T08:20:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	that's really weird. so ifconfig shows _nothing_ ?
2006-11-20T08:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Yeah.  Poking the ifconfig man page now just in case
2006-11-20T08:20:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	cool
2006-11-20T08:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Hey now, magical -a switch
2006-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	i was just gonna suggest that, actually :-) so the cards are there?
2006-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lastnode	Looks good - going to try bring one up
2006-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	lastnode	tonyyarusso	good luck :-)
