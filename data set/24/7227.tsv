2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		yeah finally got this BASTARd
2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		lol
2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		---> /dev/input/mice
2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		ok because I ran xorgconfig I have this popup window:
2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		The X system keyboard settings differ from your current GNOME keyboard settings.  Which set would you like to use?
2005-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	Xgates		use X settings: Use Gnome Settings?
2005-04-21T05:39:00.000Z	Xgates		which should I pick?
2005-04-21T05:39:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	Use Gnome settings I think
2005-04-21T05:39:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	why was that? :)
2005-04-21T05:40:00.000Z	Xgates	Arnia	first some font config errors on the install saying it couldnt load the default font config
2005-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	for you :)
2005-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	I wish what caused such a complicated chain of failures
2005-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	has had a very very atypical install... and I refuse to believe its a load of coincidences :)
2005-04-21T05:46:00.000Z	Xgates	Arnia	oh there where no coincidences I assure you, hehe, I also had all the gstreamer packs on the 2nd install try say they had all done a segmentation fauly when they where getting configuerd and Openoffice also gave a configure errror too
2005-04-21T05:46:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	Sounds like you have a bad disc
2005-04-21T05:46:00.000Z	Xgates	Arnia	nope md5 was ok
2005-04-21T05:47:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	Not the download, the burn
2005-04-21T05:49:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	it still sounds like bad hardware that slack didn't happen to trip the regression on
2005-04-21T05:50:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	given the segmentation faults and fs corruption errors all I can suggest is either memory has problems (try memtest) or your hard-disk has begun to die
2005-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	powernowd is the power management daemon
2005-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	On laptops it does an amazing job
2005-04-21T05:58:00.000Z	Xgates	Arnia	yeah cant say I need it on a desktop though hehe
2005-04-23T16:29:00.000Z	Arnia	Xgates	you seem to have some very bad luck :/
2005-04-23T16:29:00.000Z	Xgates	Arnia	no just some Distro developer stupidity here is all
