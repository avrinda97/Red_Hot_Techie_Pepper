2010-01-20T22:57:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	I had half life 2 game running in wine :) just at 12 fps T.T
2010-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	I believe the core 2 duo is 64bit, as mine is...
2010-01-20T23:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	well they aren't a big deal at all, unless something is doing something that takes up  a lot of resources or something
2010-01-20T23:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	someone not something above
2010-01-20T23:39:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	so, better for gaming and such or?
2010-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	for some games I guess so
2010-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	so more for like, rendering and such? cpu intensive types of things?
2010-01-20T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	yes more for   stuff that uses a lot of CPU  power  and such
2010-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	power? well that needs to use a lot of CPU yeah
2010-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	I see
2010-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	so, its better to be using 64, just in case? since all of the linux software is compatible with 64 and 32 bit?
2010-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	games this that and the other,  Windows 7  this and that,  a bit of Google Chrome this and that as well,   that's what this channel is like these days :D   anyway
2010-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	haha yeah :)
2010-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	and then sadly on top of that the useual issues,  Adobe Flash,  pulseaudio, ATI,  and some Grub 2 issues now
2010-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	I think thats the most of the reason linux isnt a leader in distributions, the fact that 1 support is done through things like irc(and most casual people have NO idea xD) and they say the best things in life are free, and its true, I've been able to customize my linux desktop better than i did windows in about 10 minutes of my time
2010-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	well some people are working on a proper manual aimed at beginners for the next one, it will be a free PDF download.  anyway we just went off topic
2010-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	hey, even windows has issues, only problem is windows has adobe's and all hardware manufactures support, sadly...
2010-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	we did >.<
2010-01-20T23:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	and well yeah at the manufacture thing, and it's not just hardware support, it's  popular commercial software support
2010-01-20T23:47:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	Its just nice to know that people like you, and many others take time out of their day to help users without getting paid(atleast i think you arent) whereas the microsoft support get paid, and they treat you like rubbish and are of no help!
2010-01-20T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kyle6513	yep loads of us who help in here that don't get paid for it
2010-01-20T23:48:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	:D
2010-01-20T23:51:00.000Z	kyle6513	sebsebseb	and you do it over the internet, they were there in person.
