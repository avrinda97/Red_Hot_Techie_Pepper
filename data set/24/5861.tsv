2009-02-27T22:39:00.000Z	MTecknology		Does anyone know what I need to install to work with Windows filesystems?
2009-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	as already told to you you do not need to install anything
2009-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	yes I do
2009-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	what version of ubuntu?
2009-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	I don't have a vanilla install
2009-02-27T22:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	we have to guess how your system is installed??
2009-02-27T22:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	vfat is kernel module that comes with the kernel
2009-02-27T22:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	to work with what? fat32 SMB mounts CIF ntfs? again we have to guess??
2009-02-27T22:43:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	get over it, you didn't know the answer to the question, it's not a big deal
2009-02-27T22:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	ok
2009-12-09T19:35:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	.... any idea how to fix that?
2010-02-02T03:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	do not run compiz ?
2010-02-02T03:34:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	no
2010-02-02T03:35:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	any ideas how to do that?
2010-02-02T03:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	disable the desktop effects... i do not know what you want to achieve
2010-02-02T03:43:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	I want to disable composite in Xorg, not gnome
2010-02-02T03:43:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	I'm just creating an xorg.conf though; I'll just deal with it that way
2010-02-02T03:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	then create a xorg.conf and disable it there
2010-02-02T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	"Xorg -configure" will create one resambling the autiomatic configuration it does anyway
2010-02-02T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	with sudo
2010-07-08T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	well yes; ps should able to print the command line used to launch a process in most cases
2010-09-21T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	i expect most people with wireless to use network manager or even wicd no interfaces
2010-09-21T19:42:00.000Z	MTecknology	erUSUL	I'm trying to use wicd.. I don't know what's going on
2010-09-21T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	MTecknology	and wicd needs interfaces for anything?
