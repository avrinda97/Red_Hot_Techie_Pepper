2008-09-13T01:22:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	oh, you want to use emerald.
2008-09-13T01:23:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	did you install the emerald theme in the gui?
2008-09-13T01:23:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	Did you open Emerald Theme Manager and add/install a theme?
2008-09-13T01:24:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	ok, you can start emerald theme manager in System->Preferences->Emerald Theme Manager.
2008-09-13T01:26:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	somehow I'm called zoe1 now (with a one), not zoed...weird.
2008-09-13T01:27:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	ok, in that theme manager you can click on import and import a emerald theme you downloaded somewhere
2008-09-13T01:27:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	I'm back
2008-09-13T01:28:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	But it has to be an emerald theme, not some other kind of theme
2008-09-13T01:30:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	It says emerald.
2008-09-13T01:31:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	so it's ok
2008-09-13T01:31:00.000Z	zoe1	aman	then, open emerald theme manager and click on the Import... button and select your theme you downloaded
