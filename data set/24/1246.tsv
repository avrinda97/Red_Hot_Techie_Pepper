2010-10-15T12:03:00.000Z	joshmclvl1		stealth_:something got borked? have you already repartitioned it and have it blown up again, or will gparted keep you from formatting it?
2010-10-15T12:04:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	I formatted it twice to fat32
2010-10-15T12:05:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	and two kaputzes, hrm. It was unreadable immediately after pulling it out? Or did it go into a camera or something in between?
2010-10-15T12:05:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	it was working fine on my computer, I pulled it out and ion and it worked
2010-10-15T12:06:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	maybe, but what is the purpose for this? cross compatability with windows apparently? or also with a camera?
2010-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	would NTFS work with a 32gb SD card providing hes only using it for windows?
2010-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	prolly
2010-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	let me try it and see if it corrupts. If it does corrupt can I safely say to him the SD card is messed?
2010-10-15T12:10:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	brb
2010-10-15T12:12:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	with the drive or the system?
2010-10-15T12:12:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	or gparted
2010-10-15T12:12:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	the drive is giving me a warning message
2010-10-15T12:14:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	any suggestions?
2010-10-15T12:14:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	what's the warn?
2010-10-15T12:14:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	o
2010-10-15T12:14:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	I see link
2010-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	I tried to check and repair file-systems on the drive but it would not do it
2010-10-15T12:17:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	that is what I am thinking here to be honest, because it works but not for long, going to ask my mate where he got it from
2010-10-15T12:18:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	heh. 32GB too eh? pity
2010-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	good and bad news
2010-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	let's hear it.
2010-10-15T12:31:00.000Z	stealth_	joshmclvl1	I gotta go in 5 minutes and need to write files to it
2010-10-15T12:31:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	this is the derp question, but it doesnt have a r-o switch right?
2010-10-15T12:35:00.000Z	joshmclvl1	stealth_	um. idk T.T
