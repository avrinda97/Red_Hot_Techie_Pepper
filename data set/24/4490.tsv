2007-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	WaxyFresh		^mount should be /media/
2007-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 did you upgrade to 6.,10 or reinstall ?  might just be an old file
2007-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	yup upgrade
2007-04-10T07:30:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	there you go,  the bookmark didn'T get updated, just imported from your regular settnigs
2007-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 not the source list but the packages in the repos yes
2007-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 sudo apt-get update  and sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	but will apt-get upgrade work without the sources.list being upto date?
2007-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 sources.list is only a list of repositories,   sudo apt-get update will update the list of packages from those repos and sudo apt-get upgrade will upgrade packages that have newer versions
2007-04-13T11:04:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	but dont you need specific repos?like if im on dapper and i want to upgrade to fiesty dont i have to delete the dapper repos and add fiesty  ones?
2007-04-13T11:06:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	im already on fiesty im just wondering,i want to switch to command line and use my browser as little as possible,im also tired of always cut/pasteing form source-o-matic
2007-04-13T11:07:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 I've never used source-o-matic , so I don'T know,  if you are already on feisty the repos should have been properly modified for feisty packages,  don't go messing with them
2007-04-23T07:45:00.000Z	Pelo	WaxyFresh	 make sure all the phones have filters on them
2007-05-10T09:05:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	help him see if he still has a windows partition on ther i would but im not that good
2007-05-10T09:05:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	Pelo	mount should show it right?
