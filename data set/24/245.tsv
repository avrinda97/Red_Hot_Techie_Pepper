2012-05-11T17:36:00.000Z	aFeijo		hi folks, is it possible to configure my ubuntu to auto open my often used applications when I power it on?
2012-05-11T17:37:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	Sure, there's a section called 'startup applications'
2012-05-11T17:37:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	in the system configuration screen? thanks I'll hceck it
2012-05-11T17:38:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	I have unity but typing startup didn't show me any related app
2012-05-11T17:38:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	Weird, it's included by default to my knowledge
2012-05-11T17:41:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	I'm sure that works, but I'd prefer it to be in my startup application list myself, so I could remove/modify it in the future if I wanted to
2012-05-11T17:42:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	yeah me too, but I cant find that startup place lol
2012-05-11T17:45:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	 gnome-session-properties is the command to launch that dialog
2012-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	 gnome-session-properties is the command to launch that dialog
2012-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	I found the dialog, I'm adding my programs, but I dont recall the terminal command name
2012-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	What program are you trying to add
2012-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	terminal
2012-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	you probably want gnome-terminal
2012-05-11T17:48:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	though I prefer xfce4-terminal myself :)
2012-05-11T17:48:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	it's just got a few less bells and whistles, and the scrollbar doesn't randomly disappear on me when I use it like it does with gnome-terminal.
2012-05-11T17:49:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	I often use it with screen, so scroll wont work anyway
2012-05-11T17:50:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	mine just add this: ~
2012-05-11T17:51:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	do you use the multiscreen feature and shortcuts to swap each one? I configured mine with F5 and F6 for that, and when I open screen, it gives me 4 screens already
2012-05-11T17:52:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	I do not.. I just make new screens as I need them
2012-05-11T17:53:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	multiples in one is very useful, and you can split the screen in 2 or more, fantastic to monitor a server
2012-05-11T17:53:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	a screen split showing htop & mytop next to your prompt, great stuff
2012-05-11T17:56:00.000Z	aFeijo	UICTamale	here it is my ~/.screenrc file, try it :)

2012-05-11T17:56:00.000Z	UICTamale	aFeijo	thanks
