2009-10-29T05:33:00.000Z	mgmuscari		how do you restart a kernel module?
2009-10-29T05:34:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	you can modunload and then modprobe a kernel module, *if* no-ones currently using it...
2009-10-29T05:35:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	it's my wifi driver... so i guess disable networking and then modunload/modprobe it?
2009-10-29T05:35:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	harmless to try it...
2009-10-29T05:44:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	a log of all package changes is kept in /var/log/dpkg.log
2009-10-29T10:48:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	there should be a log of package changes in /var/log/dpkg.log. You might be able to track down and backout the relevant change...
2009-10-29T10:49:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	yeah i've been hunting through there and i can't figure out what the heck changed. i tried going back to the .15 kernel that was working well for me
2009-10-29T10:50:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	I recommend 8.04 LTS. The most stable distro around...
2009-10-29T10:50:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	i like some of the features of 9.04 that didn't work well for me in 8.04
2009-10-29T10:51:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	Well, you can't have it both ways. Either you have the latest features, or you have stability. Pick one...
2009-10-29T10:52:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	ideally i would like my 9.04 system to be where it was last week, without having installed whatever updates made everything go haywire... then i'd like to turn off the update manager and have it leave me alone
2009-10-29T10:54:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	well that's possible, with a little effort you can roll back your packages to the state they were in last week, using /var/log/dpkg.log. And no-one forces you to update.
2009-10-29T10:55:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	what kind of script-fu would i have to do to get that done?
2009-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	you could do it by hand. Starting from a week ago in the dpkg log, use synaptic to restore the older versions of your package. Chances are, it's just one or two packages that are misbehaving...
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	how would i restore to an older version?
2009-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	I thought synaptic had an option to restore an older version?
2009-10-29T10:59:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	it looks like it's the 2.6.28-16 upgrade that wonked my laptop
2009-10-29T10:59:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	usually the previous kernel is still on disk, boot an older kernel...
2009-10-29T11:00:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	that's what's confusing me, i figured the problem would disappear if i booted to the older kernel
2009-11-03T07:20:00.000Z	losha	mgmuscari	I think the real flaw with your backup plan is that if the lvm stuff gets corrupted, you've spent a long time backing up an already corrupt device. Much better to backup at the file level using tar or rsync or some such...
2009-11-03T07:21:00.000Z	mgmuscari	losha	yeah...
