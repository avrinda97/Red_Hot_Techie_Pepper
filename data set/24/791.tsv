2012-05-04T13:53:00.000Z	Aruzsi		Hi,
2012-05-04T13:55:00.000Z	Aruzsi		How can I "clone" an Ubuntu 12.04 to some other machines? I think about different UUID, MAC etc.
2012-05-04T13:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	2 easiest ways are to either "dd" clone the entire drive (make sure drive #2 is at least as big as drive #1) or copy the system over as normal and reinstall grub
2012-05-04T13:58:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	Wat about MAC or anything else?
2012-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	MAC as in Macintosh or network card identifier?
2012-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	MAC address
2012-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	MAC addresses are stored in the network hardware itself, when linux boots up it re-checks it anyways (if it even bothers to care what it is).
2012-05-04T14:01:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	and what about LAN card (NIC id?)
2012-05-04T14:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	don't worry about the MAC addresses. Linux reads the code directly from the hardware at boot time and doesn't even store in on the HDD
2012-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	NIC will be identified.
2012-05-04T14:06:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	I think
2012-05-04T14:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	grub doesn't use the UUID's, it uses the (hdX,X) format, the UUID's are mostly used in /etc/fstab so the kernel knows where to mount stuff AFTER grub has passed control over to it
2012-05-04T14:51:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	There is UUID in my Grub2 menu which was genereated automatically.
2012-05-04T14:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	really? weird...
2012-05-04T14:53:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	Yes, weird! Absolutelly
2012-05-04T14:53:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	12.04 Server
2012-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	is it possible for you to pastebin the exist menu.lst. We may be able to write the new one for you instead of trying to walk you through i

2012-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	no menu.lst
2012-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	it is Grub2!!!!!
2012-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	ah
2012-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	:(
2012-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	Aruzsi	DarwinSurvivor	I know simple Grub and I hate Grub2!
2012-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Aruzsi	oh yeah, I forgot all about that :(
