2010-08-12T19:06:00.000Z	dj_korppi		I cannot believe that 9.10 -> 10.04 upgrade destroyed my RAID1... if that really is the case I'd say that's a _serious_ flaw
2010-08-12T19:08:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	unless you've deliberately written to the disks involved in the RAID, they should still be intact. try recreating the array.
2010-08-12T19:10:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	only thing I've done manually is mdadm --assemble --scan as the raid was not working when I booted up using this live CD
2010-08-12T19:10:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	with what result?
2010-08-12T19:10:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	I got md0, but with empy partition table
2010-08-12T19:11:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	these disks are separate from the disk on which you've installed ubuntu?
2010-08-12T19:11:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	before the mdadm I tried using this GUI disk utility but it said it cannot start the array as some parts was missing
2010-08-12T19:11:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	no, md0 is mounted as /
2010-08-12T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	which disk utility?
2010-08-12T19:12:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	system->administration->disk utility
2010-08-12T19:14:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	could you pastebin the output of mdadm --query?
2010-08-12T19:15:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	mdadm --assemble --scan won't work, because it relies on having a raid configuration file in /etc, which was probably overwritten in the upgrade.
2010-08-12T19:15:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	well, strike that last bit, that seems unlikely, on further consideration.
2010-08-12T19:17:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	mdadm --query only says "no devices given"...mdadm --query /dev/md0 says /dev/md0: 144.39GiB raid1 2 devices, 0 spares. Use mdadm --detail for more detail.
2010-08-12T19:17:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	and --detail?
2010-08-12T19:17:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	this is my first time in IRC don't know what pastebin is :)
2010-08-12T19:19:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	pasted
2010-08-12T19:19:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	i'll need the link :-)
2010-08-12T19:20:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	http://paste.ubuntu.com/476958/
2010-08-12T19:21:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	looks fine to me. and when you mount it?
2010-08-12T19:23:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	wth? now it mounted?
2010-08-12T19:23:00.000Z	sipior	dj_korppi	like magic!
2010-08-12T19:23:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	o.O
2010-08-12T19:27:00.000Z	dj_korppi	sipior	this is so very strange I cannot understand this... now I must try reinstalling grub according to the instructions... I hope the computer boots then. thanks for the magic :D
