2006-05-11T08:16:00.000Z	arcade		Ah.. damn.. no 64bits packages .. hmm .. is it possible to use 32bit packages with ubuntu 64bits?
2006-05-11T08:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	yes
2006-05-11T08:17:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	How do I get apt to find them? :)
2006-05-11T08:17:00.000Z	arcade		deb http://blognux.free.fr/debian unstable main   << reports 404 NOT FOUND, which I guess is because it tries to find 64 bits packages.
2006-05-11T08:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	edit your sources.conf file
2006-05-11T08:18:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	at the moment ti just points apt to the 64 bit packages
2006-05-11T08:18:00.000Z	arcade		Hmm .. sources.conf .. hmm
2006-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	do you mean apt.conf ?
2006-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	linux_galore		.. /etc/apt/sources.conf
2006-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	I don't hae that file, nor a manpage for that file .
2006-05-11T08:20:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	But I do have a manpage for apt.conf, which talks about Architecture ..
2006-05-11T08:21:00.000Z	linux_galore		sorry /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	its a simple text file
2006-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	Uhm, I know. ;)  I'm trying to find out how to configure the $(ARCH) thing now. :)
2006-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	only thing you really need is the 32 bit version of firefox
2006-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	arcade		ahh, there.:D
2006-05-11T08:23:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	No, I really need to get the webcam-detection-thingie to work, and they haven't compiled it for 64bits, it's on some non-official site.
2006-05-11T08:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	I just download the tar.ball from the mozilla home page and unpacked it in /usr/lib and created a link to /usr/local/bin  to the firefox binary
2006-05-11T08:24:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	I'm not interested in firefox. :)
2006-05-11T08:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	just compile the app then
2006-05-11T08:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	arcade	download the source and compile it, no biggie
2006-05-11T08:26:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	What I probably should do is just fetch the kernel sources and patch'em with the proper usb drivers for the webcam.
2006-05-11T08:27:00.000Z	arcade		Problem with compiling for ubuntu for me is that the gcc 4 vs gcc 3 thing is confusing the hell out of me. ;)
2006-05-11T08:28:00.000Z	arcade	linux_galore	Last time I _used_ to compile things, I was using gcc 2.95 on Solaris .. time has been moving a tad too fast for me ;)
