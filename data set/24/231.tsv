2012-02-23T06:26:00.000Z	chown_		guys, im tying to start using ubuntu. but i also would like to have a windows so i could boot into it if i needed. i have 2 250GB hds, what would be better install each one into 1 different hd, or partition both into the same hd?
2012-02-23T06:27:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	no better really, it is a matter of understanding the bootloaders and the mbr.
2012-02-23T12:11:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	run sudo update-grub in ubuntu it should show in the grub menu
2012-02-23T12:12:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	the ubuntu HD if first to be read in the bios should just show the grub menu at powering on.
2012-02-23T12:13:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	ty, lemme check it out
2012-02-23T12:13:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	put the ubuntu drive first and update-grub in ubuntu and you should be set. :)
2012-02-23T12:14:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	yeah the ubuntu is the way to go at bios, im gonna get this sudo update now and see what happens... tyvm man
2012-02-23T12:14:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	no problem.
2012-02-23T12:17:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	man u r awesume, it did work. Ty so much for helping me. It will save me a lot of time. I do apreciate ur help. I hope i can get confortable with linux, and can be able to put windows behind
2012-02-23T12:18:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	no problem, your in good shape having windows able to boot on its own.
2012-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	I have run a restart of ldm not everything running was still running.
2012-03-01T12:56:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	i see, well sometimes my windows menu bars disappears... i dont know what to do so i run rr ldm, do u think is there another way?
2012-03-01T12:56:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	have you tweaked compiz, I assume your running unity.
2012-03-01T12:57:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	yeah, im running unity. what do u mean?
2012-03-01T12:57:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	is compiz running stock?
2012-03-01T12:58:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	compiz is running to
2012-03-01T12:59:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	have you changed compiz at all?
2012-03-01T12:59:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	a little, do you think my changes are causing it?
2012-03-01T13:00:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	probably I set mine to run the cube, regularly the window header disappear, you can install  compiz-fusion, and make a desktop launcher that will restart compiz, or just do it in the terminal.
2012-03-01T13:01:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	 oh,  so it is compiz that makes it disappear
2012-03-01T13:01:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	so by restarting compiz it would fix
2012-03-01T13:02:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	ty
2012-03-01T13:10:00.000Z	chown_	urfr332gO	well in order to enable cube, you had to disable unity, right?
2012-03-01T13:11:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chown_	no there are web tutorials OMGubuntu has one I think, the key is that restart cause the desktop goes crazy.
