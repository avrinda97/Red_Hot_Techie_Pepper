2007-02-23T15:30:00.000Z	TheMonkeyMoo		endafy, I had a lot of trouble with various ATI video cards, but have not had any problems with Nvidia cards.

2007-02-23T15:41:00.000Z	TheMonkeyMoo		endafy, if you get the ENVY script form http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html and have an internet connection working on the machine with the ATI card, you can use it to install the ATI drivers from the CLI. ENVY is a python script to download and install the latest drivers for you automatically for nvidia and ATI cards. I haven't tried it with ATI, but it worked great for my nvidia
2007-02-23T15:42:00.000Z	TheMonkeyMoo		endafy ah, I see
2007-02-23T15:44:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		No really, please does anyone have any idea why that occurs?
2007-02-23T15:46:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		ok this is the one question does that problem have to do with the matrox card or with the sata drive
2007-02-23T15:46:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		because theoretically ubuntu claims it has support for both, seemingly enough it seems their is no support for either l
2007-02-23T16:02:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		does ubuntu use smp kernels as well?
2007-02-23T16:03:00.000Z	bigjohntoday		if so i am using kernel version 2.6.17-10 what would the smp of that be? i know smp is used for multi cpu support
2007-02-23T16:03:00.000Z	TheMonkeyMoo	bigjohntoday	Ubuntu uses a generic kernel that obsoletes the SMP kernel. at least that's what it installed on my centrino duo
