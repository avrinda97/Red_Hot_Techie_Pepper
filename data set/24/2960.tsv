2009-11-04T08:35:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	are you serious?
2009-11-04T08:39:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	yeah i was but he just told me it'd take 2 weeks xd
2009-11-04T08:41:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	look into linux from scratch or maybe gentoo if you like the idea of compiling stuff for no good reason
2009-11-04T08:42:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	why do you want to compile an entire linux distro if you find things too complicated?
2009-11-04T08:42:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	i heard that if you compile it yourself it'll run faster
2009-11-04T08:42:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	did a gentoo user tell you that?
2009-11-04T08:43:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	nope, in  c channel, i asked them aftear reading it in many sites
2009-11-04T08:43:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	it'll make no appreciable difference to you
2009-11-04T08:43:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	they just confirmed me that compiling a source for your exact system will run smoother
2009-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	correct
2009-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	the time wasted compiling stuff in gentoo doesn't give you a performance boost that makes it worthwhile
2009-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	i can run it in background that's no problem
2009-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	make & hehe
2009-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	no, you can't it'll zap your machine's performance for days
2009-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	but if it isn't worthwile then i'll keep with the one i got for now, anyway, in the near future i want to do it, just to LEARN how to do a dist compilation
2009-11-04T08:50:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	didn't know compiling an os would be soooooo slow hehe
2009-11-04T08:50:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	it isn't _that_ slow, but you wont be able to get any use out of the machine while it happens, and compiling ubuntu would be far more complicated than gentoo
2009-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	compiling entire distros, unless you actually need to, is for kiddies
2009-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	not for me, i'd really like to know, i like to know how unix works
2009-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	but i know i must start on the basycs, and then go for harder things
2009-11-04T09:00:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	indeed, configure and compile the kernel first, like Devastator suggested
2009-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	so why do you think that compiling the whole distro, including kernel, is easier than compiling just the kernel?
2009-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	obiwan_	philh	i thought so philh , cause i didn't want to tweak anything, just download the exact same code canonical used and to type something like make or gcc -someflags ubuntumakefile hehe
2009-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	philh	obiwan_	but if it were that easy, what would you have learned?
