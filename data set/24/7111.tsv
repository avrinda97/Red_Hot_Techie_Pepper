2005-04-22T16:52:00.000Z	paulfox		hmm, let me look up the syntax
2005-04-22T16:54:00.000Z	paulfox		so join foo bar > foobar, will take foo and bar, and redirect it (>) to foobar
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	paulfox		does anyone know any good guides for using python for system stuff, like how to make tarballs from a certain dir using python?
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	I wouldn't bother
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	you'll just end up shelling out to tar to do it
2005-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	so if i wanted to do a daily backup of a certain directory every day through cron, would i use a bash script?
2005-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	yeah
2005-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	ok cheers, i'll look into that
2005-04-22T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	some processes are unkillable
2005-04-22T09:36:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	would they be kernel processes?
2005-04-22T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	no, user ones
2005-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	stressed out much?
2005-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	if they get stuck waiting for the kernel to do something, like access a broken network filesystem or something
2005-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	hrm?
2005-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	you said user processes are unkillable, i thought you were being sarcastic :)
2005-05-04T16:05:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	it's not simple.  how much do you know about networking?
2005-05-04T16:05:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	only bits and pieces really
2005-05-04T16:05:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	try asking on the user list, then
2005-05-04T16:05:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	sorry i missed what you just said :/
2005-05-04T16:06:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	try asking for help on the user list
2005-05-04T16:07:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	right, i'll try that thanks
2005-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	update-rc.d
2005-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	paulfox	bob2	thanks. you're like an encyclopedia of linux knowledge, you are
2005-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	bob2	paulfox	np
