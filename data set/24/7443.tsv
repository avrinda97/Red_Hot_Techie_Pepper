2005-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		hmm, it seems I killed something important, I can't right-click on my desktop to open the dialog :-\
2005-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		does somebody know what program I'm missing?
2005-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	log out and back in again
2005-04-20T14:30:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	too much trouble :-/
2005-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	didn't help
2005-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	thanks, but I assume you mean xserver-xorg
2005-04-20T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	right
2005-06-07T15:40:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	ooh, you must be scared now :-<
2005-06-07T15:42:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	thanks for notifying me
2005-06-07T15:43:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	I guessed you would handle the problem :-)
2005-06-07T16:18:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	man tar: hint tar -cf foo.tar /directory/to/tar/
2005-06-07T16:18:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	thanks
2005-06-08T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	some are slower than others
2005-06-08T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	and others have better default colour schemes
2005-06-08T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	that's about it
2005-06-08T15:05:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	could you name a fast one for low resource machines?
2005-06-08T15:06:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	how low?
2005-06-08T15:06:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	128meg ram 800mhz
2005-06-08T15:06:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	the ram is the bottleneck I suppose :-p
2005-06-08T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	any will be fine
2005-06-08T15:07:00.000Z	bob2	Fator_Dee	pterm is nice
2005-06-08T15:12:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	yea, pterm looks nice, and it's much faster in changing between channel windows in irssi than xfterm4
2005-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	bob2	Amaranth?
