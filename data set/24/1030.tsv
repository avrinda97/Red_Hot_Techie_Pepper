2010-09-01T21:13:00.000Z	whosjose		Question: How can i switch back to windows? Is there anyway I can do so?
2010-09-01T21:15:00.000Z	whosjose		I've tried to use the windows CD but I get an error.
2010-09-01T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	  if you think the linux install is some how breaking the cd.. you could delete all the linux parittions, and even use dd to zero the hard drive.. making it totally unallocatged/unformated
2010-09-01T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 but i would be VERY suprised if linuix on the HD is affecting the cd.
2010-09-01T21:17:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	I believe if I can reformat the hard drive to at least a fat32 or ntfs it will work.
2010-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 thats easially done... I would suggest you grab a live linux cd or 2 BEFOR you try all this. in case you need an OS to get to the internet with
2010-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	I was going to give that a try.
2010-09-01T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 the 'gparted live cd' is a Must have in any PC owners toolbox
2010-09-01T21:19:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	I'll be back, thanks for all your help. I'm going to try the live cd
2010-09-04T12:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 you are having an issue booting an 'actual' windows cd? this IS a actual cd from microsoft? or some backup/restore/system rescue version made by a pc?
2010-09-04T12:54:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	I'm having problems booting the cd, and yes it came from microsoft.
2010-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	what i don't understand is that when I use virtualbox everything goes fine. perfectly fine in fact.
2010-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	  could be a hard drive/cd issue  where it can barely read the first boot sectors
2010-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 vbox is being smarter about the errors.
2010-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	so what do you recommend on me doing?
2010-09-04T12:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 other then not using windows..   or making a copy of the disk under linux, or go see about it in #windows.. its not really a ubuntu related issue. You Could use vbox to install to a real physical hard drive (but that can get nasty)
2010-09-04T12:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 you can also somehow convert a vbox install to a 'real' hard drive . (also nasty)
2010-09-04T12:57:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	nah i can't risk it. i've tried it before and it took me almost two days to repair my hd
2010-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 thas why the vbox mnanual has BIG warnings in that area/topic :)
2010-09-04T12:58:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	thanks for your time:)
2010-09-04T12:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	whosjose	 if its a legal cd, try making a copy via dd/ddrescue then burning it back to cd. and try the copy.
2010-09-04T12:59:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	i've done that before
2010-09-04T13:00:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	nothing worked for some reason....
2010-09-04T13:00:00.000Z	whosjose	Dr_Willis	what im going to do is mess with the bios
