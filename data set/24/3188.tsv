2008-04-04T16:32:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	How far are you getting in startup?
2008-04-04T16:38:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	Sok...  Where is your installed ubuntu locking up, or dying?
2008-04-04T16:39:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	Trying to install now?
2008-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	that's what we're trying to figure out...

2008-04-04T16:44:00.000Z	yahuuu	lopin	so how to figure out then ? u guys are experts .....
2008-04-04T16:44:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	I can't figure out where the thing is stopping from your description.  You're starting the live disk, and selecting "Start or Install", correct?
2008-04-04T16:45:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	Now, you're selecting the first option in the list, right?
2008-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	Woah!  Wait!
2008-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	yahuuu	lopin	i m sorry , u go ahead
2008-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	So, we're loosing it somewhere in the installer then?
2008-04-04T16:48:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	Maybe...
2008-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	See, I had a knoppix cd that worked in every comp but mine...
2008-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	it was cause mine gave up easy on scratches...
2008-04-04T16:50:00.000Z	lopin	yahuuu	that's good!
