2012-07-29T20:23:00.000Z	DarkSim	dr_willis	None wants to talk with me since it's too annoying to hear all the shit I do, even if I mute my mic it leaks through
2012-07-29T20:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 theres some ekype forum  and wiki pages. i dont use it..
2012-07-29T20:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 its installed by default
2012-07-29T20:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 forget the lame cube ;)
2012-09-26T15:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 you mean you installed 'ubuntu-desktop' on a ubuntu server, install ?
2012-09-26T15:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 so you login at the lightdm login screen and what happens exactly
2012-09-26T15:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 does the console login work
2012-09-26T15:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 try the console. it sounds like some messed up user setting/file.
2012-09-26T15:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 why are you looking in /root/ for it?
2012-09-26T15:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 you logging into x as root?
2012-09-26T16:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 and thatsa a good thing.
2012-09-26T16:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 you do not directly login to the x desktop as root.
2012-09-26T16:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 you login as a user and use sudo as needed
2012-09-26T16:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	DarkSim	 running the gui as root is NOT 'as normal'
