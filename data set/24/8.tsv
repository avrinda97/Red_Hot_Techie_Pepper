2005-01-29T16:42:00.000Z	yaaar		so, i'm trying to build my own package for sun-j2sdk1.5, as instructed by http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Java ....but I can't get the 'dpkg -i' and 'apt-get install' steps to complete. Both steps error out saying "file not found" basically. The wiki says the first step will error, but that the second one will work properly...
2005-01-29T16:43:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	are you pointing to the actual file?
2005-01-29T16:43:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	well, i would if I knew what it was. The steps are just listed complete, so i'm doing it verbatim
2005-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	part of the process is creating a file
2005-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	no kidding...
2005-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	that's the file you want to install
2005-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	how do i know what file it created?
2005-01-29T16:45:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	that's the file you're trying to install
2005-01-29T16:53:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	so, how am i supposed to know what file got created? none of the commands the wiki says to run specify the output file.
2005-01-29T16:54:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	surely the dpkg -i <package> line specifies the name?
2005-01-29T16:55:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	well, it specifies what I took to be the input file....but that's the command that's saying file not found. and i'm using the exact same filename after -i that it shows in the wiki, and then in the next step i'm using the same thing also.
2005-01-29T16:56:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	if you've followed the process, you'll have a .deb file there
2005-01-29T16:56:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	that's what you're meant to be installing
2005-01-29T16:56:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	i *did* follow the process, and i don't have a .deb file anywhere i can detect.
2005-01-29T16:57:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	so something went wrong :)
2005-01-29T16:57:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	is it supposed to be in the directory i was in when i did all that stuff?
2005-01-29T16:57:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	no kidding?
2005-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	well, if you don't have a .deb file, i can only assume something went wrong
2005-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	i sort of started with that knowledge. i came in here hoping to find out WHAT went wrong
2005-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	go through the steps again, watch the output
2005-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	check what files exist at each point, etc.
2005-01-30T17:00:00.000Z	yaaar	jdub	so, is it the fakeroot step that's supposed to create the .deb file?
2005-01-30T17:00:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	sure
2005-01-30T17:17:00.000Z	jdub	yaaar	strongly recommend using fakeroot instead.
