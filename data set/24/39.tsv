2012-10-26T02:51:00.000Z	jbohren		anyone here familiar with the default python search paths on ubuntu?
2012-10-26T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	please just ask your real question
2012-10-26T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	can you show on a pastebin?  Perhaps by doing  « PYTHONPATH='WHATEVER' python -c 'import sys; print sys.path' »
2012-10-26T02:55:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	yeah, one sec
2012-10-26T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	also, what ubuntu version?
2012-10-26T02:57:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	http://pastebin.com/JSCHaegB
2012-10-26T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	what ubuntu version?
2012-10-26T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	what's the output of « which python »?
2012-10-26T02:59:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	which python gives /usr/bin/python which is a symlink to python2.7
2012-10-26T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	it's weird that /usr/local shows up in there.  Do yo uknow what that's about?
2012-10-26T03:01:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	well that first thing looks like it's something from pip
2012-10-26T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	what do you have installed to /usr/local?
2012-10-26T03:04:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	a few things
2012-10-26T03:04:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	what things python-related? :)
2012-10-26T03:06:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	there are a few things, a newer mercurial, some web stuff, pithos, and pip
2012-10-26T03:07:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	though the package I'm trying to override is in /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7
2012-10-26T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	check for interesting .pth files I guess
2012-10-26T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	in /usr/{,local/}lib/python2.7/dist-packages
2012-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	ahh right on the money
2012-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	eh?
2012-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	that's what it is, a .pth file from when I used easy_install at one point
2012-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	oh, ok
2012-10-26T03:10:00.000Z	jbohren	jrib	ok, I've got it from here, thanks for your help!
2012-10-26T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	jbohren	no problem
