2009-08-18T14:25:00.000Z	rashed2020		Is there a text editor in busybox?
2009-08-18T14:26:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Try 'nano' or 'vi' - but I doubt that'll work....
2009-08-18T14:31:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	I dislike BNCs too. I see no reason to stay connected 24/7 - I cannot respond anyway.
2009-08-18T14:32:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	Logs are the only reason I like BNCs. But they're horrible vulnerable.
2009-08-18T14:32:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Logs? screen+irssi.
2009-08-18T14:34:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	Never got the hang of irssi =/ I really should learn how to use it one of these days, though.
2009-08-18T14:36:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	lol, you mean speaking of UGLY
2009-08-18T14:37:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Yeah. It isn't that ugly when run on Wine, actually.
2009-08-18T14:47:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	The binary? 'which vi', or 'type vi'
2009-11-08T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	As long as you have Xserver running, you can run any X app. including GTK, Qt, anything.
2009-11-08T21:03:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	I'm assuming running E17 means xserver is running, right?
2009-11-08T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Yes.
2009-11-14T18:52:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Add -9 to the kill command... such as killall -9 name or kill -9 pid
2009-11-14T18:53:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	Nope.
2009-11-14T18:53:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Is the process owned by you? If not, add 'sudo'.
2009-11-14T18:54:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	If 'sudo kill -9 pid' does not kill a process, there can be only two explanations: a) the process is a zombie - already dead, the system is just waiting for its parent process to notie.
2009-11-14T18:54:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	b) the process is stuck in "uninterruptible sleep" - usually waiting for a file read/write to finish.
2009-11-14T18:54:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	'ps u <pid>' should tell -- look for "D" or "Z" in the STAT column.
2009-11-14T18:54:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	Anything I can do? I don't think it's dead because it's processor usage is fluctuating between 97% and 100%/
2009-11-14T18:55:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	ps u <pid>, paste the line here.
2009-11-14T18:56:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	Processes whose names are in [brackets] are actually kernel threads - you cannot kill them.
2009-11-14T18:56:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	So I have to reboot? Cuz this is killing my desktop.
2009-11-14T18:57:00.000Z	grawity	rashed2020	I guess so.
2009-11-14T18:57:00.000Z	rashed2020	grawity	Alright, thanks.
