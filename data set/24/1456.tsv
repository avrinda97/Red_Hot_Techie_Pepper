2010-01-09T02:05:00.000Z	nohup		Good day all
2010-01-09T02:05:00.000Z	nohup		does anybody know any circuit simulation software for linux ?
2010-01-09T02:06:00.000Z	nohup		as in something you can actually draw a schematic into and then simulate it ?
2010-01-09T02:06:00.000Z	nohup		(just fairly simple circuits...)
2010-01-09T02:06:00.000Z	nohup		and not ktechlab, cause that thing is totally and utterly useless
2010-01-09T02:06:00.000Z	nohup		autocad ? for linux ? does it simulate electronic circuits ?
2010-01-09T02:07:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	google knows....
2010-01-09T02:08:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	What about here: http://eece.ksu.edu/~khc/circuits.html
2010-01-09T02:09:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	nothing of that actually allwos me to draw a circuit.. tried all that crap :)
2010-01-09T02:09:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	sorry, just trying to help...
2010-01-09T02:09:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	i know :) but i tried googling :)
2010-01-09T02:14:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	I thought spice was *the* circuit simulator....
2010-01-09T02:15:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	yeah.. and 'ngspice
2010-01-09T02:15:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	yeah.. and 'ngspice' has a command prompt... not an interface to make schematics in
2010-01-09T02:17:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	the web page mentions Spice3 and "has an interactive command interface and X11 graphics support", whatever that means....
2010-01-09T02:18:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	hmm.. from what i've seen is that you have a command interfaace... and something that outputs some graphs and stuff
2010-01-09T02:19:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	dunno, you're so far out of my field of expertise now that it's not funny....
2010-01-09T02:21:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	hehe, that's ok... thanks for trying to help though
2010-01-09T02:24:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	I agree, not many of them on #ubuntu however. Look for an electronics channel, maybe. And be prepared to find they're all using windows....
2010-01-09T02:24:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	they probably will.. for work i had to use vmware for about everything i needed :)
2010-01-09T02:25:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	google says ##electronics. Worth a try...
2010-01-09T02:26:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	okay :) will try :)
2010-01-09T02:38:00.000Z	Losha	nohup	that's electronics types for you....
2010-01-09T02:39:00.000Z	nohup	Losha	yeah i guess :)
