2010-05-22T08:50:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	that depends... I not really a doctor
2010-05-22T08:51:00.000Z	atroy1994		will i hav 2 remove windows b'fore installing ubuntu?
2010-05-22T08:52:00.000Z	atroy1994		thanks
2010-05-22T08:52:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	you do have the option of installing them side by side... I've heard it's usually a good idea to defragment a windows partition before you set up a dual boot
2010-05-22T08:53:00.000Z	atroy1994		is installation of ubuntu easy?
2010-05-22T08:53:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	I've also read that it's better to have windows installed first.
2010-05-22T08:53:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	I did it :P so it can't be that hard
2010-05-22T08:54:00.000Z	atroy1994		is it a long processs?
2010-05-22T08:54:00.000Z	atroy1994		how much time is taken?
2010-05-22T08:55:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	usually depends on hardware but I'm installing it on a computer that has 3. GHz and ~700MB or RAM... it's taking me 20 minutes or so
2010-05-22T08:56:00.000Z	atroy1994		will compilers like codeblocks run on it?
2010-05-22T08:56:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	edbian is right... schedule an hour :P
2010-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	atroy1994	PDG1	i hav heard, linux is more complex than windows. Is it?
2010-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	I just looked at the Codeblocks site and it says it works with ubuntu
2010-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	atroy1994		ok. fine
2010-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	partially... but not at first. The fact that you're using an app like codeblocks suggests that you're not afraid to learn... and that's the main part of using Linux is learning
2010-05-22T09:00:00.000Z	atroy1994		yes, i am learning c++
2010-05-22T09:01:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	don't be afraid of complexity. I used windows on the family computer until i was about 17 and then got a computer and tried Damn small linux.
2010-05-22T09:01:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	and now I'm finding it hard to use Windows again :P
2010-05-22T09:02:00.000Z	atroy1994		is ubuntu the latest version of linux?
2010-05-22T09:02:00.000Z	atroy1994		if yes, when was it released?
2010-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	Ubuntu is more like a different flavour of linux. Linux describes a lot of different operating systems..
2010-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	PDG1	atroy1994	pm?
