2006-11-07T07:01:00.000Z	secretum		I wasnt asking if i could ask
2006-11-07T07:01:00.000Z	secretum		just stating
2006-11-07T07:03:00.000Z	secretum		I am testing the live cd right now, both edgy and dapper, but I have a problem.  Edgy will not let me switch to my normal resolution, 1280x1024, where dapper lets me.  I was wondering if I installed Edgy, would it make me use 1024x768, or is there a fix?
2006-11-07T07:04:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	once you install you'll be able to do it in edgy.
2006-11-07T07:04:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	what toma- waid
2006-11-07T07:07:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	you can kill by name with     killall
2006-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	yes.  you can mount the windows partitions
2006-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	ntfs read only, vfat either read only or read/write
2006-11-07T07:13:00.000Z	secretum	sethk	how, because it gives an error when i click on it in the file manager
2006-11-07T07:14:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	either run the file manager as root (using sudo), or, more easily, bring up a terminal window and use the mount command with sudo
2006-11-07T07:16:00.000Z	secretum	sethk	what do i type, i am a newbie to linux, sorry
2006-11-07T07:17:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	if your windows partition is the first partition on IDE Primary master, you would do something like this:   mkdir /mnt/ntfs         then, on the next line            sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/ntfs
2006-11-07T07:17:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	you probably need sudo with the mkdir command also:   sudo mkdir /mnt/ntfs; sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/ntfs
2006-11-07T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	you mount to any empty directory, so the name /mnt/ntfs is just an example.  the /dev/hda1 part has to match.  /dev/hda1 assumes first partition on first IDE disk.
2006-11-07T07:19:00.000Z	secretum	sethk	this comes back  mount: special device /dev/hda1 does not exist
2006-11-07T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	ok, then it's not the first partition on IDE primary master.  IDE primary master may or may not exist (it could be a cd drive, and not have a partition table)
2006-11-07T07:19:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	try /dev/sda1, which is good for first partition on the first SATA disk
2006-11-07T07:20:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	or as lullabud said, might be the second drive.  do you know?
2006-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	secretum	sethk	i am pretty sure tat it is the first drive, i will try /dev/sda1
2006-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	ok.
2006-11-07T07:22:00.000Z	secretum	sethk	no error, now how do I get to it?
2006-11-07T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	try  cd /mnt/ntfs
2006-11-07T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	you should also be able to find it in the file manager gui
2006-11-07T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	secretum	go to /, click mnt, etc.
