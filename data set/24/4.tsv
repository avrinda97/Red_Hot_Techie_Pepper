2004-10-30T13:37:00.000Z	fabbione		ok
2004-10-30T13:37:00.000Z	fabbione		hold on
2004-10-30T13:37:00.000Z	fabbione		what is this problem with the BusID?
2004-10-30T13:38:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	it prevents direct rendering from working with a stock XF86Config-4
2004-10-30T13:40:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	I don't think the 1st AGP/PCI device isn't guaranteed to be 1:0:0, either, which may be what bit Kirsch. He's the 2nd person I know who has hit the problem.
2004-10-30T13:40:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	one laptop, one desktop, very different configs.
2004-10-30T13:40:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	the PCI values are calculated
2004-10-30T13:40:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	the same way as the first primary card is detected
2004-10-30T13:40:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	it's not a random value
2004-10-30T13:41:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	so why is it setting 1:0:0 on the driver for the 2nd card? and getting it wrong for Kirsch?
2004-10-30T13:41:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	do you have 2 differend cards in the box?
2004-10-30T13:42:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	I didn't get hit by it, I commented it out before getting X working.
2004-10-30T13:42:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	mikal_ is the other one who got hit by it (hope I'm remembering his nickname right)
2004-10-30T13:43:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	if the savage driver does not support the BusID, it should simply skip it.
2004-10-30T13:43:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	if it doesn't is a driver problem
2004-10-30T13:43:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	it sounds like it's not checking to make sure it matches the PCI ID to the right card. Should probably get lspci output from both these guys and try to figure out what is happening
2004-10-30T13:43:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	not a configuration error
2004-10-30T13:44:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	he's not using the savage at all
2004-10-30T13:44:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	onboard, I think he said it's disabled in cmos
2004-10-30T13:45:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	ok if you don't have the problem, let me talk and ask specific info to them. Otherwise it gets only confusing
2004-10-30T13:52:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	sorry, it was mirak_ who had the same problem
2004-10-30T13:55:00.000Z	Despair	fabbione	that bad paste I did earlier was from mirak_'s XFree86 log, and I believe that's the same thing Kirsch reported earlier.
2004-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	it seems to be either a driver problem or a kernel problem. I am checking with Kirsch 
2004-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	fabbione	Despair	for sure it's not something it will get fixed for warty
