2011-03-20T23:01:00.000Z	shadow66142000		I'm having issues connect to the internet with my Ubuntu server. If I create a new static ip and then reboot, it will be able to connect to the inter for about 3 minutes and then I get 'host cannot be found'. I can then change my ip address again repeat the process exactly like the first time. Any ideas what is going on?
2011-03-20T23:02:00.000Z	shadow66142000		driver issue maybe?
2011-03-20T23:02:00.000Z	shadow66142000		I can ping anything within my network
2011-03-20T23:02:00.000Z	shadow66142000		but that's it
2011-03-20T23:03:00.000Z	shadow66142000		only for the first 3minutes or so
2011-03-20T23:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	sounds like a network manager problem  maybe try stop it
2011-03-20T23:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	try sudo service network-manager stop
2011-03-20T23:05:00.000Z	shadow66142000	sacarlson	unrecognized service
2011-03-20T23:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	stop letting network-manager mess you up,  I've seen it alot kill it
2011-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	or did you try starting dhclient that would do the same thing if it continued to run
2011-03-20T23:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	is that when it's not working?  that looks good
2011-03-20T23:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	ok I missed that ya the bottom is bad like the network was down and up again without route added
2011-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	shadow66142000	sacarlson	I'm not sure what this means exactly. Any ideas what could be causing this?
2011-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	what does your /etc/network/interfaces file look like?
2011-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	yes many things could cause that if that's what you told the interface to do

2011-03-20T23:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	that looks good to me not sure why it would do that then
2011-03-20T23:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	unless one of the other network mangers are running like wicd or network-manger or ??
2011-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	shadow66142000	sacarlson	this is the server edition. I'm not sure what is installed by default, but I haven't installed any. I set this up manually.
2011-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	did you try the stop command I gave you before?
2011-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	shadow66142000	sacarlson	which?
2011-03-20T23:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	sudo service network-manager stop
2011-03-20T23:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	shadow66142000	but even if it was running it shouldn't cause a problem with what I see in you interfaces file so what else could be changing it?
2011-03-20T23:50:00.000Z	shadow66142000	sacarlson	s5fs: thanks for the help. I'm going to look into a few things and if I continue to have the problem I'll repost with summary of our results. thx
