2006-05-24T07:26:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	let me paste you mine in a second
2006-05-24T07:27:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	okay thank you

2006-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.list
2006-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	how is the menu.lst coming along?
2006-05-24T07:37:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	got it open
2006-05-24T07:38:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	 that should work
2006-05-24T07:39:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	to the name of my 1st hard drive
2006-05-24T07:39:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	(hd0,0) is the first partition on your first harddrive
2006-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	because i had windows installed before ubuntu, hd0,0 is where my windows sits
2006-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	it should work like that for you too, unless you have partitions or drives moved around weird
2006-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	in my menu.lst, all of the Ubuntu Kernels have the root as (hd0,0)...that's why I'm asking
2006-05-24T07:41:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	it looks like Ubuntu is installed there
2006-05-24T07:42:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	try hd0,0... if that doesn't work, maybe hd1,1 or any combination of the two
2006-05-24T07:43:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	okay.  Also, I need to make sure I set the linux drive to boot 1st in my BIOS don't I?
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	play around with it. half the fun is figuring it out... i really don't know your harddrive configuration
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	thanks for all your help
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	i tried my best
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	jonuk	filip_	you did a good job
2006-05-24T07:45:00.000Z	filip_	jonuk	thankyou.
