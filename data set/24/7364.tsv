2005-08-02T10:14:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	this is the channel for newbies to ask newbie questions :)
2005-08-02T10:15:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	correct, that's simply impossible :)

2005-08-02T10:18:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	that's a tough one
2005-08-02T10:18:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	search for 'cedega howto' on ubuntuforums.org
2005-08-02T10:19:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	the easy way is to pay the crators of cedega and get an easy-to-install installer
2005-08-02T10:20:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	then they should have sent you instructions and an installer
2005-08-02T10:28:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	sudo -i
2005-08-02T10:39:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	not that much, due to the nature of linux security
2005-10-08T16:49:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	no we can't see them ;)
2008-03-31T00:06:00.000Z	Seveas	brian__	no
