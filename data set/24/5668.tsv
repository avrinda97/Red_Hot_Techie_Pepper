2006-06-12T13:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid		How do I reconfigure the xserver under xubuntu
2006-06-12T13:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid		if its dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg under gnome is it different under Ubuntu
2006-06-12T13:21:00.000Z	SurfnKid		I guess its the same
2006-06-12T13:22:00.000Z	SurfnKid		that question was for anyone else too
2006-06-12T13:22:00.000Z	SurfnKid		:)
2006-06-12T13:23:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	it doesn't matter, that just reconfigs xorg, not your DE/WM
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	no
2006-06-12T13:26:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	that only works for X server
2006-06-12T13:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	the liberty of not having to restart to apply settings, uff better :)
2006-07-08T10:52:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	^^ what ubotu said
2006-07-08T10:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	i got XGL going
2006-07-08T10:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	just the keys i need to get used to
2006-08-13T10:56:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	there's SCREAM, or NVU, but a good ol' text editor works pretty well too (I like Jedit)
2006-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	ah ok i thought SCREEM was good, but ive got tables and theyre yucky to edit :)
2006-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	generally easiest to do it by hand
2006-08-13T10:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	yeah ive got this page source i want to edit, but once i see a lot of code, my eyes start crossing 0_0
2006-08-13T10:59:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	well, if the source is properly spaced, and indented it's not too bad. But if it was created with a wysiwyg then you're pretty much SOL on that count
2006-08-13T11:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	hehe yeah
2006-08-13T11:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	i think it was created in Geo.... somethin
2006-08-13T11:07:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	hey quick question on the editing part of screem, ive got the code window, but i want a edit preview window to change and see what im doing, is there something i should enable
2006-08-13T11:08:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	I don't think there's a way to do that
2006-08-13T12:11:00.000Z	SurfnKid	polpak	nvu has preview editing, SCREEM doesnt.. but nvu is memory hungry
2006-08-13T12:11:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	I hate wysiwygs anyway, but to each his/her own
2006-08-13T12:12:00.000Z	polpak	SurfnKid	I'll stick with jedit
