2012-02-13T09:20:00.000Z	ch33z		no just CLI

2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		should i just install a gui?
2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		im runinng a server
2012-02-13T09:21:00.000Z	ch33z		but running a server with gui is kinda dumb right?
2012-02-13T09:22:00.000Z	ch33z		mc?
2012-02-13T09:22:00.000Z	ch33z		ah
2012-02-13T09:23:00.000Z	ch33z		well hmm
2012-02-13T09:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	ch33z	i use sftp to make changes to files on the server of mine, use the clients tools to make changes then update
2012-02-13T09:23:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	so all i am trying to do is
2012-02-13T09:24:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	simple html files, and share some hard drives I have the static ip set up as well so yea
2012-02-13T09:24:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	I imagine just the DNS, samba, and apache need to be configured?
2012-02-13T09:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	ch33z	you already have ssh to the server, add sftpd to the server, then make the connection to the server with every gui tool avail, works for me
2012-02-13T09:27:00.000Z	ch33z		o cool, but almoxarife arent gui bad for the servers?
2012-02-13T09:27:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	web servers and such?
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	since servers are used with only the CLI?
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	ch33z	the gui is at the client not the server
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	which is what i am using...
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	the server..
2012-02-13T09:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	ch33z	what Feldegast said
2012-02-13T09:30:00.000Z	ch33z		ah
2012-02-13T09:30:00.000Z	ch33z	almoxarife	so i just need sftpd and thats it?
