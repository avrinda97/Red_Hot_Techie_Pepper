2010-01-07T02:06:00.000Z	redleaf	hekdahl	System/admin/sys monitor will spec out your kernel version
2010-01-07T02:08:00.000Z	redleaf	hekdahl	4315 supported 2.6.32 and later
2010-01-07T02:09:00.000Z	hekdahl	redleaf	2.6.31-16-generic, is that it?
2010-01-07T02:10:00.000Z	redleaf	hekdahl	yes, but your chip supported 2.6.32 and later
