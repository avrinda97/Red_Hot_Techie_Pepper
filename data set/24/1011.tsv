2010-09-13T20:46:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves		Whats up guys...i have a good question about running a server...i currently run a server behind a firewall (router) with most of the daemons' ports redirected to the server internally...how hard is it to redirect for BIND (nameserver)
2010-09-13T20:47:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves		i believe 53 is for dns
2010-09-13T20:48:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 redirecting the ports to the internal dns server shouldn't be particularly difficult. getting outsiders to use it might be.
2010-09-13T20:49:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 be aware that your isp might now allow that traffic.
2010-09-13T20:49:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	ahhh yes i feel that getting outsiders to use it might be hard as well
2010-09-13T20:50:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 you want to point to your own dns from outside?
2010-09-13T20:50:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	i got my domain from godaddy and was using their dns servers (totalDNS they call it) but when i switched it to my local server...nothing really worked, im not sure where to being as DNS is my weakest point
2010-09-13T20:51:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 there's a lot to be said for using external dns hosting if your box won't be up fulltime. that said, if your isp will allow the traffic, you can run your own. did you enter your address as authoritative for dns?
2010-09-13T20:52:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	i want my internal server here to be the nameserver for my domain...it shouldn't have too traffic. but i want control on my end here
2010-09-13T20:52:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 sure, i understand. but if your box is offline, you might lose mail, etc. it can certainly be done. did you change the dns entries to point to your server?
2010-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 i tried the same thing some years back, so sympathize.
2010-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	yea i changed the dns entires to point to my server, once the old entires disapeared out of the other nameservers it all went down
2010-09-13T20:53:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	im with you man, i'd rather stay with godaddy, sorry for the flipflopping
2010-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 have you confirmed that your isp isn't filtering dns requests to subscriber addresses?
2010-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 do a test from outside and see if it's working.
2010-09-13T20:54:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	basicly, i was told to host the name server locally because mail being sent from the server was ending up in the junk email folder or spam folder "because the nameservers were hosted by godaddy"
2010-09-13T20:55:00.000Z	IpwnSlaves	bobstro	Yea i tested from outside (at home) and i couldn't resolve the ip
2010-09-13T20:55:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 ah. i'm using dyndns and no problems. i do use isp mail server as smarthost though, to avoid those problems.
2010-09-13T20:55:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 you'll still get flagged by spamfilters if coming from isp ranges, most likely.
2010-09-13T20:56:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 AT&T is well known for being fascist about source addresses for email (which is probably a good thing, spam-wise).
2010-09-13T20:56:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 i have business customers that get filtered for the same reason, even on expensive commercial service.
2010-09-13T21:01:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 are you relaying mail upstream to your isp's mail server, or sending directly from your (home?) server to destination?
2010-09-13T21:16:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 say, exactly how many of your messages were getting flagged and by who?
2010-09-13T21:17:00.000Z	bobstro	IpwnSlaves	 if someone is using overly-fascist spam filters, there may be nothing you can do.
