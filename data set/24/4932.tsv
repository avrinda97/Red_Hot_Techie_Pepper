2006-12-15T16:16:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	yould you be a bit more precise :-)
2006-12-15T16:17:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	ok....
2006-12-15T16:17:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	what are you trying to accomplish?
2006-12-15T16:19:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	ok,I think I understand, if you are following the vmware instructions, you are told to su. (to get root)
2006-12-15T16:19:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	in ubuntu you type "sudo su - " and then provdie _your_ password
2006-12-15T16:20:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	is your current user, the first user created in your newly installed ubuntu?
2006-12-15T16:20:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	no, type "sudo su -" ENTER_KEY
2006-12-15T16:21:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	again: is your current user, the first user created in your newly installed ubuntu?
2006-12-15T16:22:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	then the userpassword should be accepted to get a root login with sudo
2006-12-15T16:22:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	there is no root user in ubunut (sort off)
2006-12-15T16:23:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	try again, and describ _exactly_ what output you get.
2006-12-15T16:24:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	dont type "su" type "sudo su", focus dude, focus!
2006-12-15T16:25:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	you got _root_! you can proceed now (may the source be with you, young skywalker)
2006-12-15T16:26:00.000Z	HuibertGill	Rob423	and _please_ read the page about sudo, it has very inportant information
