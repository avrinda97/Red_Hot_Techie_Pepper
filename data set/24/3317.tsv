2008-05-11T21:23:00.000Z	Fructose		Can anyone help me figure out how to get my microphone to work? Trying to get Skype to work so I can call my mom for mother's day </shameless plea>
2008-05-11T21:23:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	in a terminal do: alsamixer
2008-05-11T21:23:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	oh you need skype installed?
2008-05-11T21:23:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	Already is installed
2008-05-11T21:24:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	alsamixer
2008-05-11T21:24:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	hit m to unmute stuff and up and down to change volume
2008-05-11T21:24:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	make sure you have the right Mic selected
2008-05-11T21:25:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	how goes it?
2008-05-11T21:26:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	Well, I tried using it before... part of the problem is that I don't know how the hell to use Sound Recorder to test it
2008-05-11T21:26:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	why not use skype voice test?
2008-05-11T21:26:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	um, you could install audacity...
2008-05-11T21:26:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	Tried that too, but takes longer
2008-05-11T21:27:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	Also tried Audacity and it has as many options as Sound Recorder
2008-05-11T21:27:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	um.. in audacity you just hit r on your keyboard and start speaking. when you are done you hit space bar
2008-05-11T21:28:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	Well, no. There are a lot of recorder options in Preferences and the playback also fails.
2008-05-11T21:29:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	you need it set to hw:0,0 for both playback and mic
2008-05-11T21:31:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	The recording device is hw: 0,0, but there's not even an option for playback device.
2008-05-11T21:32:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	well record and see if there is a wav image
2008-05-11T21:32:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	There is one that looks like noise... seeing if I can save and play it now
2008-05-11T21:33:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	looks like your mic works
2008-05-11T21:33:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	NO it doesn't
2008-05-11T21:33:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	It's just noise
2008-05-11T21:34:00.000Z	Fructose	heymr	I was speaking into it at the time
2008-05-11T21:36:00.000Z	heymr	Fructose	and you are using an onboard mic?
