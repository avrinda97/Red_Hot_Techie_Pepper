2008-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	just change the theme
2008-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	I thought you had a drive icon and you just wanted to change the icon
2008-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	unfortunately not, i want to mount the drive as a drive not as a folder :)
2008-05-18T22:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	please explain the differece
2008-05-18T22:20:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	do you use nautilus ?
2008-05-18T22:20:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	ok, so check the computer:///
2008-05-18T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	yes, I see all my drives
2008-05-18T22:21:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	you should see the drive "/" and maybe other hard or cd or even nfs drives
2008-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	i have a line in fstad that mounts my /dev/sda7 to /media/DriveData
2008-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	but this drive doesn't appear in computer:///
2008-05-18T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	Ok following so far
2008-05-18T22:23:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	i can access it via /media/DriveData, but i would like to have it in shortcuts, computer:/// and other handy places, like a drive.. :)
2008-05-18T22:24:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	see what i mean ?
2008-05-18T22:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	not yet..
2008-05-18T22:25:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	that is waht i want can u paste your /fstab somewhere
2008-05-18T22:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	sure

2008-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	thx
2008-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	finally managed to do it, I had a link to the mount point in /media/ and that wasn't enough, i had to move the moint point to /media/ for it to appear like a drive
2008-05-18T22:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	yes, link would not work
2008-05-18T22:35:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	ok, now maybe you know how to do the same with nfs drives
2008-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	see my fstab, there are several ntfs in my fstab
2008-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	rigolo	Jack_Sparrow	nfs (network drives)
2008-05-18T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rigolo	sorry, misread
