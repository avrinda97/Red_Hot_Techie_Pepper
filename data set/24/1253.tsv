2011-02-05T10:15:00.000Z	qreezy		also... my hardware on another machine of mine is failing, lag on the OS as well (music machine)
2011-02-05T10:15:00.000Z	qreezy		could it be dusty air or something? what the hell... lol
2011-02-05T10:17:00.000Z	Loshki	qreezy	well, funnily enough, dusty air can clog fans and cause overheating, which might manifest as 'lag'...

2011-02-05T10:18:00.000Z	qreezy		i DO have cpu spikes on my music machine too... but i mean could the air really be THAT bad?
2011-02-05T10:19:00.000Z	qreezy		its so strange that a youtube video uses 70% of my cpu resources... what is that?

2011-02-05T10:23:00.000Z	Loshki	qreezy	If you were in a lumberyard maybe I'd worry. But realistically, it's probably something else.
