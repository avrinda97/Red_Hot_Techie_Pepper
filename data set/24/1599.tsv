2009-11-04T14:48:00.000Z	taofd		how long does it take for ubuntu one to sync? is there a "force sync now" button?
2009-11-04T14:49:00.000Z	taofd		i like empathy :d
2009-11-04T14:49:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	may i ask why?????/
2009-11-04T14:49:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	why not? it does what i need it to do, it's deeply tied with gnome, i can store my passwords in the gnome keychain, and it doesnt crash like pidgin does :/
2009-11-04T14:50:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	i guess for you its good enough...but i couldnt even change fonts there... i hate it.
2009-11-04T14:51:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	maybe later it'll get better... but right now its not good enough.. at least for me.
2009-11-04T14:51:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	features are sparse, i agree, but what do you want to use in particular that empathy doesnt have? besides video)
2009-11-04T14:52:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	IRC didnt work for me..
2009-11-04T14:52:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	does it work for you??
2009-11-04T14:53:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	i don't use those sort of chat clients for IRC... i usually want something a little more specialized
2009-11-04T14:53:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	all i do in IRC is type something and press enter so i dont really need much... but like i said.. it didnt even work..
2009-11-04T14:54:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	that's weird... it shouldn't just "not work"
2009-11-04T14:54:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	maybe check on the forums if other users are experiencing a similar problem?
2009-11-04T14:55:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	nah... i cant even change fonts with empathy.. its not worth the effort for me.... maybe when its more mature.
2009-11-04T15:00:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	what are you talking about?
2009-11-04T15:00:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	im just talking about how karmic some issues for some ppl myself included.... (some ppl being the key phrase.. no fan boy crap please...)
2009-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	a lot of ppl say that.. i guess that makes it ok.
2009-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	just pointing out that its expected, keep in mind that while ubuntu is canonical sponsored, the majority of the developers are working from their OWN time, this is a volunteer project, its pretty amazing we even have something like this community to begin with
2009-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	im not saying its complete crap.. but it sucks that some ppl cant even automount CD/DVDs and have to do it manually... and mice not working among other things. thats all...
2009-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	are you a windows hater? lol
2009-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	go fix it :) if you see a bug, post a bug
2009-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	no fyi, I am not, but I do believe in being proactive in the community, lets get back on subject, if you want to continue this discussion go to #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	taofd	if i could fix it i would.. i really would... but sadly i cant.. all i can do is post bugs and help out here or things like that.
2009-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	taofd	eL_pSycHo	well thats enough, posting bugs are important
