2009-04-11T22:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	what kind of driver problem?
2009-04-11T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	you can, but your lap top isn't really server hardware
2009-04-11T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	it wasn't desigend to be left on all the time
2009-04-11T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	same thing for the standard desktop
2009-04-11T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	probably better running it on the lap top then the desktop though
2009-04-11T22:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	no you don't need server hardware
2009-04-11T22:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	just  your lap top  or  desktop may work for longer, if it's not left on all the time
2009-04-11T22:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	of course for a real website, you  still need to pay someone for a domain name, but those are pretty cheap these days  I think
2009-04-11T22:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	yes
2009-04-11T22:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	what's nr?
2009-04-11T22:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	ok  Ubuntu server edition,  if your only going to use that computer to host a website
2009-04-11T22:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	what driver issue?
2009-04-12T01:09:00.000Z	ubuntun00b10997	sebsebseb	reccomended you to me
2009-04-12T01:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ubuntun00b10997	indeed ask the room
