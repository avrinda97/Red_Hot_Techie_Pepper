2010-12-16T10:45:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	tha is a good script to dfine a interface when it starts up__
2010-12-16T10:50:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	What do you mean by "define an interface"?
2010-12-16T10:52:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	i nee to start up and always my IP to be the 172.16.0.1 is a router
2010-12-16T10:52:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	You should be using /etc/network/interfaces for that
2010-12-16T10:52:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	but always when I restart I get no add for that interface
2010-12-16T10:53:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	is that a script__
2010-12-16T10:53:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	no, it's a configuration file for one of Ubuntu's networking subsystems. See 'man interfaces'.
2010-12-16T11:30:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	can you help me understand the file you point at me... the eth1 172.16.0.1 is a pre-up or post up job??
2011-02-05T03:41:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	/etc/rc.local
2011-02-05T03:41:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	but that script need root permittions... how can I do that__
2011-02-05T03:42:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	commands in /etc/rc.local are run with root permissions.
2011-02-05T03:42:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	thanks!!
2011-02-05T03:42:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	so I just copy and paste the script... or should I put an extension is a vim file without extension!!
2011-02-05T03:43:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	yes. or save the script somewhere and run it from /etc/rc.local
2011-02-05T03:43:00.000Z	rww	toyotires	/etc/rc.local itself doesn't need a filename extension.
2011-02-05T03:43:00.000Z	toyotires	rww	how can I do that__
