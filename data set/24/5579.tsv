2006-10-19T10:00:00.000Z	_azrael		For some reason, only OSS works on my system. What should I check to figure out why ALSA's not working.
2006-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	more detail would be nice.
2006-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	After installing the new flash 9, I noticed no sound. I heard that only alsa was supported, so I decided to double check my alsa was working by doing mplayer -ao alsa foo.mp3, which hangs. From this I'm concluding that alsa for some reason isn't working, and that I've been using OSS only for a while without noticing.

2006-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	are you watching/listening to a flash applet atm?

2006-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	known issue with that mixer. I've already sent the appropriate patches to our kernel lead, and hopefully they'll be available in a new kernel soon.
2006-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	in the meantime, pastebin ``amixer''

2006-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	does increasing your 'PCM' level help?
2006-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	Does not help.
2006-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	This is not quiet sound, this is no sound. Additionally, mplayer in the past has been very valid at detecting whether sound systems are present and working.
2006-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	(mplayer -ao alsa hung if you missed me saying that)
2006-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	it's not a matter of it hanging. Like I said, I know about the issue. I've patched it. The fixes are ready but haven't been released in a Ubuntu kernel yet.
2006-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	Is the patch available somewhere so I could apply it to kernel source and recompile myself?
2006-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	depends if you want the easy way or the hard way. Do you use your own kernel?
2006-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	_azrael	crimsun	At the moment, no. However, I migrated to ubuntu from gentoo, so I have a good deal of experience compiling kernels :P
2006-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	_azrael	then just grab alsa-kernel hg or jaroslav's git tree, and compile one.
