2008-09-02T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	convert to avi and burn
2008-09-02T20:07:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	the .mpg files are already in DVD-format.... which type of .avi do you suggest ?
2008-09-02T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	avi is avi, mpg is mpg, mpg != avi
2008-09-02T20:08:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	I know, but there are different types (layers/coders/etc) even if the extension are the same

2008-09-02T20:09:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	alright, I will try and see if it does the miracle. Thanks for the tip.
2008-09-02T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	you could always convert the avi to dvd iso
2008-09-02T20:11:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	how does that work? I should first convert the mpg's to avi's, then from avi's to dvd iso? Isnt' there a quality loss each time I convert?
2008-09-02T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	should be ok, give it a whirl, you might be able to go from mpg to dvd

2008-09-02T20:20:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	that last link was about a guy who wasn't able to see his mpg on his DVD-player. In my case, the mpg's are already dvd-format (I chose DVD-format when I created them) and I am able to watch it on DVD-player. It's just that it cuts 1 cm or so from the left and from the right on the TV. He gets an answer that he needs to create dvd images . So should I create dvd images from the mpg files, or just convert to avi and burn it as a data d
2008-09-02T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	i think youre gonna experiment especially with the extra variable of your dvd player
2008-09-29T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	you'll need helix or realplayer
2010-07-16T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	sudo apt-get clean   is a good place to start, also uninstalling old kernels can save ~120Mb per kernel
2010-07-16T17:36:00.000Z	needhelp	ActionParsnip	I've already done that. :)
2010-07-16T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	then install bleachbit and clean stuff off with that (watch your browser settings or it'll clean your passwords up, and avoid the options stating they will take a long time)
2010-07-16T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	also run: dpkg -l | less    and remove stuff you don't use. If you only use writer in OpenOffice then consider removing it (300Mb) and installing abiword (12mb)
2010-11-04T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	needhelp	you can use rsync to synchronise between 2 folders
