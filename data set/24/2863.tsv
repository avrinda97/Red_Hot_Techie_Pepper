2008-08-01T23:32:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	or: ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2008-08-01T23:35:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	Istill cant find the plugins eventhough I go to the folder and look into it... I marked view hidden files
2008-08-01T23:36:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	What plugin is it?
2008-08-01T23:36:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	How did you install it?
2008-08-01T23:36:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	I want to delete flash plugins
2008-08-01T23:36:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	I think ubuntu-restricted-something.... or automatically... I dont remember which of those two
2008-08-01T23:37:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	Ok... you can try /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2008-08-01T23:37:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	the folder is empty
2008-08-01T23:38:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	Is the plugin showing up in the Addons window?
2008-08-01T23:38:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	yes it does... if you are refering to the Add on tab in mozilla add-on -- plugins option
2008-08-01T23:39:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	not only that one but several
2008-08-01T23:39:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	Well, do you know what directory it's loading those plugins from?
2008-08-01T23:39:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	Is this a firefox installed from the repos, or manually?
2008-08-01T23:41:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	I dunno what you asked me but I can say that honestly it came with ubuntu and then it upgraded itself to 3.0 ... I ddont think that was manual
2008-08-01T23:42:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	ok... well, according to synaptic, the flash-nonfree package installs to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2008-08-01T23:42:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	I also looked into firefox 3.0 plugin folder and nothing.... there is another folder firefox-addon .... neither there
2008-08-01T23:42:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	oohh but there is a folder named flashplugin-nonfree....
2008-08-01T23:42:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	but it also installs to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2008-08-01T23:43:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	mmmmmm ok so If I uninstall flash nonfree... then It will be automatically deleted from mozilla?
2008-08-01T23:44:00.000Z	lufis	axenory	It should be, but if the directory is empty, it shouldn't even be there
2008-08-01T23:44:00.000Z	axenory	lufis	mmm ok I found it thanks !
