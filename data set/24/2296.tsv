2010-05-20T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	mp3split
2010-05-20T04:01:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	will try it
2010-12-31T05:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	it is the official channel of the fastest growing Linux distro....what did you expect
2010-12-31T05:14:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	there's _got_ to be a better way of providing support over irc than this
2010-12-31T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	its worked pretty well for the last 4 years I've used ubuntu and the 10 I've used Linux
2010-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	there is also the ubuntu forums and launchpad where you can post questions
2010-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	you'll learn how to read it
2010-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	I've always thought a very basic yahoo answers type system would be a good way of providing support
2010-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	thats how the launchpad questions work
2010-12-31T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	i'd say not, look at the karma awarded by users whom have recieved help: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+topcontributors
2010-12-31T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	how is the forum any different to yahoo answers?
2010-12-31T05:19:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	I did not say yahoo answers exactly
2010-12-31T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	either way, suppport is rolling nicely for everyone else
2010-12-31T05:20:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	What I envision is a very basic page with something along the lines of "So you're having a Ubuntu problem, please describe it below" <textbox> <submit button> - user then sent to an ajax page that essentially loads solutions as people answer the question, and on the other side is a searchable page that anyone else can go to and answer these questions
2011-01-25T22:56:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	that is not the issue.
2011-01-25T22:56:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	the issue is I can't even use sudo because it just refuses my password
2011-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	then hold shift at boot and boot to root recovery mode, then you can run
2011-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	passwd foo    and set the pass for 'foo'
2012-01-24T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig; gksudo nvidia-settings    set the resolution to something and click 'save to x config file', then run:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    and change the resolution in the screen section to what you desire. Reboot to test
2012-01-24T23:51:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	Done, can I just restart X rather than rebooting and if so how xD
2012-01-24T23:52:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	since they disabled the usual shortcut
2012-01-24T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kn100	sure, if you get no desktop, drop to root recovery mode and rename the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2012-01-24T23:52:00.000Z	kn100	ActionParsnip	yep yep
