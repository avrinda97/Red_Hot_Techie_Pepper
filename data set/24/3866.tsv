2007-09-24T11:06:00.000Z	iownyou	nickrud	can you help with Mounting root partition, chrooting into it and editting xorg.conf vertical refresh and horizontal synchronization rates
2007-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	are you booted into a live cd right now?
2007-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	yes
2007-09-24T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	ubuntu i386
2007-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	releases.ubuntu.com/7.04
2007-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	iownyou	nickrud	how long is this download going to take?
2007-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	it's 670 gb. Do you have any working linux available?
2007-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	make that mega bytes, not gb :)
2007-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	iownyou	nickrud	lol no i dont but how long are you going to be on here?
2007-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	not a lot longer; but there's always someone around who can tell you how to edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file from a live cd. Just say that's what you need to do
2007-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	iownyou	nickrud	: can you give the command to mount the root partition, chroot and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf vert refresh and horizon sync?
2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	I haven't used the livecd in a while, so I'd have to ask you a couple of questions to get in sync. But, its basically:  sudo chroot /media/<root partition> ; nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf ; then delete the refresh rates you have
2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	cast has a point, I picked up from the other guy, did he give you a reason?
2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	have you tried the recovery boot option?
2007-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	lets try something that may save a lot of time. reboot, and when the screen says something about grub, if you don't see choices of os's, hit escape.
2007-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	then, choose recovery from the choices there.
2007-09-24T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	then, after you've gotten a line you can type on (and don't hit ctl-d) type    dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and don't choose a high refresh rate
2007-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	neither
2007-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	keep getting the live cd, it's a good tool to have and you can get here for a walkthrough
2007-09-24T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	chroot /media/<rootpartition> ; dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ; choose your driver and then your resolution. But the aussies will be thick on the ground in a few hours, they can walk you through
2007-09-24T11:40:00.000Z	iownyou	nickrud	so i do all of this in terminal and dont change any of the code
2007-09-24T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	iownyou	yes, the dpkg-reconfigure writes it for you
