2011-05-02T21:58:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		o.o
2011-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		but i need to emulate them
2011-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		like mount one on top of the other
2011-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		:/
2011-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		what?
2011-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r		how do i emulate an iso on ubuntu?
2011-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	you type sudo mount -o loop filename.iso /mnt/whatever
2011-05-02T22:02:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	seems easy to me
2011-05-02T22:05:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	alt+f2 and type "gmountiso"
2011-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r	LjL	I have no idea how to use this command.
2011-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	use gmountiso then
2011-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	*sigh* i told you how. hit alt+f2 and then type "gmountiso"
2011-05-02T22:10:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	it's probably also in the Applications menu somewhere
2011-05-02T22:10:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	let me see
2011-05-02T22:11:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	wait, i think we forgot the step where you'd install it :P
2011-05-02T22:11:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	open a terminal, and type "sudo apt-get install gmountiso" (or alternatively, get it from Synaptic if you prefer the GUI)
2011-05-02T22:11:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	but it's easy to do it from the terminal really, just type the above verbatim
2011-05-02T22:12:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	then get it from Synaptic, but i can't help you there.
2011-05-02T22:12:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	i don't use Synaptic, i don't even use GNOME
2011-05-02T22:14:00.000Z	numbah1hax0r	LjL	can I use the Ubuntu software center to get the version with interface?
2011-05-02T22:14:00.000Z	LjL	numbah1hax0r	probably, but i'm not sure the software center has everything. try.
