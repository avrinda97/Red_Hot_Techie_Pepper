2007-04-08T11:40:00.000Z	clearzen	atselby	Good to hear. That sound annoying
2007-04-08T11:41:00.000Z	atselby	clearzen	now the way i noticed this was i wanted to make use of a sources.list off of debianadmin.com. do you think i should try to or not risk having to repeat this?
2007-04-08T11:41:00.000Z	clearzen	atselby	Personally I would use the source list generator here: http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/
2007-04-08T11:42:00.000Z	atselby	clearzen	and add any additional ones it does not have manually? okay.
