2007-09-04T15:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	Try the intel driver if you are using an intel card, remove 915resolution as it is not needed with the intel driver
2007-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	i read that howto
2007-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	intel driver? xorg-server-intel=
2007-09-04T15:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	xserver-xorg-driver-intel IIRC, but yes
2007-09-04T15:54:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	well, everyithing actually worked well before i installed that
2007-09-04T15:55:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	this friend of mine complained about  his low resolution with the default installation system, so i've suggested him to install this package
2007-09-04T15:55:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	and is since then, that the resolution got soo damn low
2007-09-04T15:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	Did he also update his xorg.conf?
2007-09-04T15:56:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	no but i did it remotely now (changed driver to i810)
2007-09-04T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	That is the wrong driver, choose "intel"
2007-09-04T15:57:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	that was the previously defined value :(
2007-09-04T15:58:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	this is how the config looks : http://nd47.coderock.org/~azi/xorg.conf
2007-09-04T15:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	"1280x800" is the resolution you want?
2007-09-04T16:00:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	well yes, but he's telling me the icons and everything are so uninmaginable hughe
2007-09-04T16:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	Are you sure that is a resolution problem and not just that the icons are actually too big?
2007-09-04T16:02:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	well, what else could have gone wronge switching to  xserver-xorg-driver-intel ?
2007-09-04T16:02:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	also, you think i should not install :  xserver-xorg-driver-intel ?
2007-09-04T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	Nothing that I can think of, ask him to let you VNC in from System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
2007-09-04T16:03:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	he can't manage to do that
2007-09-04T16:03:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	everything is too big ;-(
2007-09-04T16:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	then enable it for him through ssh :)
2007-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	never used that
2007-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	azi	Jordan_U	what shall i run?
2007-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	azi	Don't actually know what vnc server Ubuntu uses by default, you can cheat by ssh -X ing in and running "vino-preferences"
