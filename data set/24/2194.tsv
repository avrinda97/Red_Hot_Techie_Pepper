2010-05-04T00:16:00.000Z	anom01y		yeah screw it
2010-05-04T00:16:00.000Z	anom01y		use old Linux
2010-05-04T00:17:00.000Z	anom01y		yeah well they better fix it
2010-05-04T00:17:00.000Z	anom01y		or I'm going elsewhere
2010-05-04T00:17:00.000Z	anom01y		wooo october
2010-05-04T00:17:00.000Z	anom01y		how about 10 years down the roda ?
2010-05-04T00:17:00.000Z	anom01y		road
2010-05-04T00:18:00.000Z	anom01y		is there a ubuntu out there that will last 10 years ?
2010-05-04T00:18:00.000Z	anom01y		something more reliable
2010-05-04T00:19:00.000Z	anom01y		the only thing that should be able to take out my computer should be an EM pulse, not a stupid upgrade and "dropped support" from ati or nvidia (as usual)
2010-05-04T00:20:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	there is no os that will last for 10 years in the same state
2010-05-04T00:22:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	the world you think that exists, where buisneses exist to serve customers is not real. deal with it
2010-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	anom01y	acicula	maco so what do you guys do ? buy  new hardware all the time ???
2010-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	also your card should be supported just fine with the 173.x legacy drivers, install those and if these dont work file a regression bug
2010-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	use the open source drivers
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	there is just such a thing
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	anom01y	acicula	which vid card ?
2010-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	google open source gpu probably turns it up
2010-05-04T00:27:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	anyway you dont _have_ to use binary/proprietary drivers, both ati and nvidia come by default with open source drivers
2010-05-04T00:28:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	you dont ned to
2010-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	did you manually install nvidia binary drivers or enable hardware drivers?
2010-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	anom01y	acicula	enable hardware drivers
2010-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	heu then there should be a disable the driver option if you enabled it
2010-05-04T00:31:00.000Z	acicula	anom01y	you dont need to enable any of the three
