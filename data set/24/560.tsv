2011-06-04T06:51:00.000Z	basilfaulty		unetbootin doen't run in my live-usb env
2011-06-04T06:53:00.000Z	basilfaulty		the install 11.04 proceeds, copies its files, then gives an error and apologizes... % seems about 80 or so.
2011-06-04T06:54:00.000Z	basilfaulty		So after it failed I checked and noticed a proper fs there.. used mount and chroot to real drive, then grub-install, update-grub.. now it boots but after graphical login, it just shows the background screen
2011-06-04T06:54:00.000Z	basilfaulty		something to do with pocmod?
2011-06-04T06:55:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	basilfaulty	can you get a cli?

2011-06-04T06:56:00.000Z	basilfaulty		I created the usb with 2 iso's in the dir.. it might have merged them.. screwed up my windows with partition magic tho :(.. so can only dl through the live-usb
2011-06-04T06:56:00.000Z	basilfaulty		and unetbootin doesn't seem to work
2011-06-04T06:57:00.000Z	basilfaulty		I have tried overwriting etc a few times
2011-06-04T06:58:00.000Z	basilfaulty		should unetbootin work from live-usb?
2011-06-04T06:59:00.000Z	basilfaulty		is there a list of steps I can do, or a script to start midway though an install?
