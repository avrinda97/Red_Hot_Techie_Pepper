2004-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	rublind		Ah, crap, one hour.
2004-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	rublind		Haha.
2004-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	rublind		No, I'm not that bad. :P
2004-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	rublind		Ubuntu runs like all other linux distro's right? So if I learn to use it, I can work on other ones.... right? (I mean terminal wise)
2004-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	rublind		I'm paranoid.
2004-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	rublind		I've switched around in distros.
2004-10-27T06:24:00.000Z	rublind		I had Knoppix, but I wanted the real thing, so then I tried SUSE, and didn't like it, and I just deleted my Fedora while trying to install ubuntu
2004-10-27T06:24:00.000Z	rublind		Yeah.
2004-10-27T06:24:00.000Z	rublind		I just want to be sure that I can move around in distro's.
2004-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	rublind		I'd use gentoo if it wasn't so damned hard to install (just to see it), but again, lazy.
2004-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	why would you want to move from Ubuntu ?
2004-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	rublind	LinuxJones	no clue, haven't tried it yet.
2004-10-27T06:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	what are you waiting for there are about 50 people here who will help you get it installed :)
2004-10-27T06:27:00.000Z	rublind	LinuxJones	get what installed?
2004-11-26T06:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	your sound is partially working or not working at all ?
2004-11-26T06:42:00.000Z	rublind	LinuxJones	Uh, I think not at all.
2004-11-26T06:43:00.000Z	rublind	LinuxJones	My desktop beeps when someone says my name in xchat (some times), but that's all I can get out of it.
2004-11-26T06:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	look at gstreamer-properties you may need to select between alsa or oss etc... hit the test button till your sound works
2004-11-26T06:44:00.000Z	rublind	LinuxJones	In a terminal?
2004-11-26T06:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	ya do sudo gstreamer-properties
2004-11-26T06:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	it might be that your channels are just muted in sound mixer as well
2004-11-26T06:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	try selecting alsa in gstreamer-properties
2004-11-26T06:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	ok try another type like oss
2004-11-26T06:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rublind	you have a sblive card ?
