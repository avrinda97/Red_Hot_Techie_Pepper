2010-03-18T19:53:00.000Z	deist		Hi. I'm have trubbel installing Ubuntu on my Mac but cant seem to find any documentation.
2010-03-18T19:53:00.000Z	rww	deist	What type of Mac is it?
2010-03-18T19:54:00.000Z	deist	rww	do i need to do something about the bios or something?
2010-03-18T19:54:00.000Z	rww	deist	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook would be the starting point for the community Macbook documentation
2010-03-18T19:54:00.000Z	deist	rww	I love you.
2010-03-18T19:55:00.000Z	rww	deist	It's of rather variable quality, but will hopefully be useful :)
2010-03-18T19:59:00.000Z	deist	rww	My big problem is that my mac won't boot the CD.
2010-03-18T20:00:00.000Z	rww	deist	There are Mac instructions for burning ISOs to CD at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#Mac%20OS%20X . You might want to double-check you did it right. I haven't had a Mac in a while, but I believe you should be able to just hold down C at startup to boot from CD...
2010-03-18T20:02:00.000Z	rww	deist	no, it wouldn't affect it
2010-03-18T20:03:00.000Z	rww	deist	have you booted from CD before? the timing on when to press the button to tell it to boot from CD is rather precise
2010-03-18T20:03:00.000Z	deist	rww	no the CD is booted. It just dosn't happen anything.
2010-03-18T20:04:00.000Z	deist	rww	lol no problem.
2010-03-18T20:04:00.000Z	deist	rww	the help is very apriciated.
2010-03-18T20:04:00.000Z	rww	deist	using the steps in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook , can you find out your hardware revision for me, please?
2010-03-18T20:05:00.000Z	deist	rww	but every guide assumes that the cd boots properly which it dosn't :P
2010-03-18T20:07:00.000Z	rww	deist	indeed. It's just a completely black screen?
2010-03-18T20:07:00.000Z	deist	rww	no its just a "-" sign blinking on a black screen. Looks like terminal. Allthough i can't type anything.
2010-03-18T20:08:00.000Z	rww	deist	which version of Ubuntu is it?
2010-03-18T20:08:00.000Z	deist	rww	the latest.
2010-03-18T20:08:00.000Z	rww	deist	the latest released (9.10/karmic)?
2010-03-18T20:09:00.000Z	deist	rww	really strange. No, I'm not good enough to try some beta-testing just yet :P
2010-03-18T20:09:00.000Z	rww	deist	I think I'm out of ideas. You might want to stick around and see if anyone else can figure it out, and/or ask in the Mac-specific support forum at http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=328
2010-03-18T20:10:00.000Z	rww	deist	there are some folks there who are much smarter than me about Mac stuff :)
2010-03-18T20:10:00.000Z	deist	rww	Okay. Great thanks for your time!
