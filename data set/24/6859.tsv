2005-07-18T13:57:00.000Z	Razor-X		yeah, I double-boot, that's the bad thing
2005-07-18T13:58:00.000Z	Razor-X		it's not a symbolic/visual thing
2005-07-18T13:58:00.000Z	Razor-X		I can probably LaTeX it meself, if you give it to me, but it'll never hurt to do it
2005-07-18T13:59:00.000Z	Razor-X		MS Equation Editor is hopelessly slow, and much worse than LaTeX
2005-07-18T13:59:00.000Z	Razor-X		almost all of #math's big people know LaTeX
2005-07-18T14:00:00.000Z	Razor-X		i'm not sure which mathematician in this day and age doesen't use it ;)
2005-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X		or, better yet, kjon, convert to PDF
2005-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X		that way Ubuntu can read it, albeit, can't edit it
2005-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X		lot of free tools for that
2005-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	Razor-X		available on Windows, I mean
2005-07-18T14:02:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	or you can do the math thing as a picture (which is what EqnEdit used to do) embedded in a word doc
2005-07-18T14:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	I have... regardless, it's a pain-in-the-arse
2005-07-18T14:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	something is deprecated for a reason, generally
2005-07-24T10:59:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	he hasnt gotten that far yet ;)
2005-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	you mean Open Source != free?
2005-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	then clearly explain why QWERTY the keys themselves are an advantage?
2005-07-24T11:28:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	I never said they were an advantage, but theyre both about the same, there is no speed increase for one or the other, especially if youre coding
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	don't use the `coding' excuse, switching a few keys help coding enough
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	like I said, there is no difference in touch typers speed, they both are about the same
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	the fastest typist in the world uses Dvorak
2005-07-24T11:30:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	Thats marketing, pure marketing
2005-07-24T11:30:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	and the aliens are trying to take over the media
2005-07-24T11:30:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Razor-X	fine, let me dig up references, if you insist on being fickle
2005-07-24T11:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	FlannelKing	and I probably have counterreferences
