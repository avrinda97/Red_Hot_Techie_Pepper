2007-04-20T15:37:00.000Z	LaszloKv		Hi, would someone be able to help me with configuring a samba share of a directory?
2007-04-20T15:38:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	yes
2007-04-20T15:39:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	do you want the folder to have write permission for other user?
2007-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	go to http://pastebin.ca/449603 and change what should be changed and afterwards put it in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2007-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	mainly change the path and writeable to no
2007-04-20T15:41:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	also in smb.conf in the Authentication section you have to have security = share
2007-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	I have it set up with guest ok and read only and such.
2007-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	is it working?
2007-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	and security =share
2007-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	No, that's how I started out.
2007-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	after modification did you restar samba?
2007-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	Yep.
2007-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	and it doesn't work. Can you see your folder?
2007-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	When I go to my ip address I can see the folder I want shared, but when I click it, it says my permission might be denied.
2007-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	you don't have a ; before security = share right?
2007-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	I can post my  smb.conf if you want
2007-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	Nope, no semi-colon.
2007-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	Posting your smb.conf would probably help.
2007-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	http://pastebin.ca/449610
2007-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	I have to go for lunch. pm if if it works or not
2007-04-20T15:47:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	Thanks.
2007-04-20T06:35:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	do you know what to do beyond what you had in the samba conf file?  Because I am still having a hell of a lot of trouble...
2007-04-20T06:35:00.000Z	Trist_an	LaszloKv	no, it worked for me after that
2007-04-20T06:36:00.000Z	LaszloKv	Trist_an	Damn... I still get an error that seems to be a permission denial
