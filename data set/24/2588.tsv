2008-11-15T20:36:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus		does anyone here have experience with tvtime?
2008-11-15T20:36:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus		for some reason it seems to not work with my tv-card, even though its flawlessly detected
2008-11-15T20:37:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	what about other TV programs? motv xawtv?
2008-11-15T20:38:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	i have problems getting xawtv to work, is there a channelscan somewhere?
2008-11-15T20:40:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	not in xawtv but there is one in motv
2008-11-15T20:40:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	where do i get motv?
2008-11-15T20:41:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	sudo apt-get install motv
2008-11-15T20:41:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	negativ, cant find the package
2008-11-15T20:43:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	ok then lets fall back to tvtime
2008-11-15T20:43:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	so what do you experience in tvtime?
2008-11-15T20:44:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	i open the software and start a channel scan, but no channels are detected, i already tried a different cable, but that doesnt seem to be the problem
2008-11-15T20:44:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	the card is detected as SAA7134 compatible, its a typhoon tv tuner rds
2008-11-15T20:45:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	did you check the input settings? PAL SECAM NTSC and theese things?
2008-11-15T20:45:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	which country are you in?
2008-11-15T20:46:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	so i cannot figure out, where the problem is, whether tvtime has problems with the card, the card with the system, or the card with the broadcaster. ive set PAL europe, there is not much more settings to make. i tried the tvtime configurator, which doesnt have more settings either
2008-11-15T20:46:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	did you try other settings?
2008-11-15T20:47:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	i tried the tvtime-scanner as well, which didnt detect any signals, so id like to test out whether tvtime is linked correctly to the card
2008-11-15T20:47:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	france is SECAM
2008-11-15T20:47:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	well yeah ill try some out... really not much to mess around with
2008-11-15T20:47:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	thanks, but im in germany ;)
2008-11-15T20:48:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	Germany is PAL BG  :D
2008-11-15T20:49:00.000Z	nikin	rien-ne-va-plus	did you try to hook up a video or a DVD on it?
2008-11-15T20:49:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	yeah so thats my current setting...are there other tools to at least test the tv-card? like a raw scanner like it exists for dvb-t ?
2008-11-15T20:49:00.000Z	rien-ne-va-plus	nikin	i have another tv-card (dvb-t) and a dvd drive plugged to the system, but i want to watch via the analog tv-card
