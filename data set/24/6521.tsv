2012-07-27T15:49:00.000Z	Hfuy		Any suggestions?
2012-07-27T15:50:00.000Z	Hfuy		Using this procedure: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
2012-07-27T15:50:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm not aware that I checked anything.
2012-07-27T15:51:00.000Z	Hfuy		Looking more closely, this may be by design. I'm apparently in a shell called BusyBox 1.18.5.
2012-07-27T15:51:00.000Z	Hfuy		"Help" produces a list of available commands.
2012-07-27T15:52:00.000Z	Hfuy		I have to say I tend to use windows to avoid all this BS.
2012-07-27T15:52:00.000Z	Hfuy		This is really a great advertisement for linux - it doesn't even boot!
2012-07-27T15:53:00.000Z	Hfuy		Anyway, the purpose of all this is to evaluate whether the ethernet hardware on this motherboard is bad, or whether it's a windows problem.
2012-07-27T15:53:00.000Z	Hfuy		Can I do anything  about that from here, or should I try another approach?
2012-07-27T15:54:00.000Z	Hfuy		Euhh. If I can't get Ubuntu to work, I don't fancy my chances elsewhere.
2012-07-27T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 your logic is invalid again..
2012-07-27T15:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 try some of the tools from the PenDriveLinux web site.
2012-07-27T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 it dident boot properly. it dropped back to busybox .. so somthing dident get put on the usb right.
2012-07-27T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 its possible your CD download is bad.. so your generalization is incorrect.
2012-07-27T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 Theres mini linux disrtos like TinyCorelinux (10mb) that can check that.
2012-07-27T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 or dozens of other live cd/recovery/hw testing disrtos out.
2012-07-27T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 i mentioned trying some of the many Other tools at the Pendrivelinux web site.
2012-07-27T16:01:00.000Z	Hfuy	Dr_Willis	I can try that, but if Ubuntu, the World's Easiest To Use Linux Distro can't even boot, I'm not sure how confident I am.
2012-07-27T16:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 whatever.. you want to rant all day.. have fun.
2012-07-27T16:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 youve not shown its not a bad iso file.. or any other tests. so go check the md5, try other tools. try the flash on other pcs.
2012-07-27T16:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 and aparently that dident work.. so....
2012-07-27T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	  i find that statement totally false.
2012-07-27T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 its not THEIR installer.. as you said.. it came from pendrivelinux.com
2012-07-27T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hfuy	 check dmesg command  befor you plug the cable in. and a few moments afterwards...
