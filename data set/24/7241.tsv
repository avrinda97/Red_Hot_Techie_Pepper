2005-03-25T09:48:00.000Z	PacoBCN		so polyp audio was removed and esd took its place again, right guys?
2005-03-25T09:50:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	yep
2005-03-25T09:51:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	the problem is that after all these changes I can't make esd work anymore
2005-03-25T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	is the 'esound' package installed?
2005-03-25T09:53:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	esddsp ?
2005-03-25T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	esd works now
2005-03-25T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	hope it will automatically start at start up from now on
2005-03-25T10:07:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	make sure System>Preferences>Sound>Enable sound server startup is checked
2005-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	wget http://sh.nu/~crimsun/changelog
2005-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	stash that in ~/bin
2005-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	then you can do changelog linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
2005-03-25T11:33:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	thanks a lot, however I think I won't have to dig into it
2005-04-05T07:52:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	please flood in #flood, thanks.
2005-04-05T07:56:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	linux-image-foo, linux-headers-foo
2005-04-05T07:56:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	thanks
2005-04-05T07:57:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	does /proc/cpuinfo tell you 2 cpus?
2005-04-05T07:58:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	don't find anything like that
2005-04-05T07:58:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	then you want linux-image-2.6.10-5-686
2005-04-05T07:58:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	cool, thanks
2005-04-05T07:58:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	that's the catch-all
2005-04-29T07:44:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	you can block IPs at the IP layer. You'd block MAC addresses at the Ethernet layer.
2005-04-29T07:45:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	I'm running firestarter, if I manually add ip filters, will firestarter remove them? or ignore them?
2005-04-29T07:45:00.000Z	crimsun	PacoBCN	it will block those IPs you specify.
2005-04-29T07:45:00.000Z	PacoBCN	crimsun	thanks, dude
