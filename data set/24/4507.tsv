2007-03-24T06:20:00.000Z	Pnquin007		I've problem with sound and ACPI o Acer Aspire 3650 (Intel Celeron, ATI200 chipset). Laptop sounds, but i can't setup volume, microphone is off. ACPI doesn't send informations to programs which a don't wanna run on battery and when i close display, laptop doesn't susspend.
2007-03-24T06:21:00.000Z	Pnquin007		sorry for my terrible english, it's not my natural language
2007-03-24T06:22:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	dapper or edgy? Regarding sound, did you double-click (not single-click) on the speaker icon and play with the sliders for playback and capture?
2007-03-24T06:22:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	Dappr
2007-03-24T06:23:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	after clicking on speaker icon i see mixer, bat no sliders are there :-(
2007-03-24T06:24:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	Sorry Edgy, Xubuntu
2007-03-24T06:24:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	run alsamixer from the terminal and see if you get better results.
2007-03-24T06:25:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	you might also try the #xubuntu channel because I don't know anything about the icons you will see for xfce.
2007-03-24T06:25:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	System is same, change is only in desktop
2007-03-24T06:25:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	alsamixer says: alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument
2007-03-24T06:27:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	On desktop all works fine... :'(
2007-03-24T06:27:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	you are starting to have something to google. Do you know the soundcard chipset?
2007-03-24T06:28:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 437b (rev 01)
2007-03-24T06:28:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	what does "lspci | grep audio" give you from the terminal?
2007-03-24T06:29:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	nothing...
2007-03-24T06:30:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 437b (rev 01)
2007-03-24T06:32:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	lsmod | grep snd
2007-03-24T06:35:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	I would try to find from Google exactly what chipset is in your sound card, then do some google searches for that chipset with "alsa" or "dapper" and find out how other people solved this.
2007-03-24T06:36:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	i've tried, but no success...
2007-03-24T06:36:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	so what is the chipset?
2007-03-24T06:37:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	ATI200x
2007-03-24T06:38:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	cheap laptop :-(
2007-03-24T06:38:00.000Z	whyameye	Pnquin007	isn't that the chipset of the mainboard but not of the sound card specifically?
2007-03-24T06:40:00.000Z	Pnquin007	whyameye	Yes, but its all in one, i don't know, howto get identifier of soundcard only. lspci says: 00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc Unknown device 437b (rev 01)
