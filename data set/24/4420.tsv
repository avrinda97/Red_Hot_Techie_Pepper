2007-04-19T15:03:00.000Z	elfranger		anyone up for some mount/link partition disk stuff?
2007-04-19T15:03:00.000Z	elfranger		I am lost...
2007-04-19T15:03:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	just ask
2007-04-19T15:06:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	you changed there as root, right?
2007-04-19T15:09:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	did you fall asleep?
2007-04-19T15:10:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	I'm alive and well. Get my last two lines in the private?
2007-04-19T15:10:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	no...
2007-04-19T15:11:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	nothing appears from you in private..
2007-04-19T15:12:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Ok. I'd think the folders should definitely show up inside a symlink to /ftproo
2007-04-19T15:12:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Obviously they don't. These are just regular mounts, right, nothing special?
2007-04-19T15:12:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	The folders are there... the contents is not..
2007-04-19T15:13:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	Regular mounts, yes..
2007-04-19T15:14:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	remember to write to me here as the private window does not seem to want to listen to you...
2007-04-19T15:14:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Must be something with bind. I'd see if something simpler would work. Try this: ln -s /ftproot /home/elfranger/download2
2007-04-19T15:16:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Where does the ftp client enter into all this?
2007-04-19T15:17:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	Well, a user will log on via ftp and will have /ftproot as /download
2007-04-19T15:17:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	in his home folder..
2007-04-19T15:18:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	And symlinks won't do that for you for some reason. I understand.
2007-04-19T15:19:00.000Z	elfranger	cedricshock	well, there is only a problem with the two fodlers which are mounted partitions from a different disk...
2007-04-19T15:20:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Yeah, and the big suspect is mount --bind. I'm reading the manuals.
2007-04-19T15:22:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	From man mount, under --bind:        This  call attaches only (part of) a single filesystem, not possible submounts. The entire file hierar
2007-04-19T15:23:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Not sure how to put that in fstab (maybe the mtab entry will be different and can be copied)
2007-04-19T15:26:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Short answer. Use mount --rbind instead of mount --bind
2007-04-19T15:38:00.000Z	cedricshock	elfranger	Still around?
