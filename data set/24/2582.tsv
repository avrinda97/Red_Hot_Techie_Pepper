2008-11-03T00:43:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	its just the internet is not stable. i may not be on here long.
2008-11-03T02:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	you can make yourself a part of the apache-default group, but files that are owner writable only, still wont be able to be written by you.

2008-11-03T02:38:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	i'm asking what user owns the directory, what do you mean you've changed it
2008-11-03T02:38:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	 trying to get meself access to edit it
2008-11-03T02:39:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	if you do that then apache may not work with it, because apache2.conf needs to be updated to use that user account for function
2008-11-03T02:39:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	little tooo late to tell me that
2008-11-03T02:41:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	sudo nano /etc/apache2/envvars
2008-11-03T02:41:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	change user and group to your username, then save that file, and then sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2008-11-03T02:46:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	ok ive reinstalled apache2 what do i do again to make it work right. remember all i want it to be able to make folders/files and edit them
2008-11-03T02:46:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	to fix the permisions
2008-11-03T02:47:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	installing apache2 wont affect your permission change of /var/www
2008-11-03T02:47:00.000Z	musikgoat	DVA5912	*ownership change
2008-11-03T02:47:00.000Z	DVA5912	musikgoat	it did because i destroyed the /var/www folder and apache reinitiated it
