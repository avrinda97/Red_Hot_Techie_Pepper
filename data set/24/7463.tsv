2005-10-10T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 those are kernel modules - that shoudl allready be on the system
2005-10-10T14:45:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	lsmod show that they arent
2005-10-10T14:46:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	by any chance can you help me mount a usb device?
2005-10-10T14:46:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	i take it back...they are there
2005-10-10T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 normally for my ubuntu systems when i plug in a usb device - gnome mounts and pops open a window for it.
2005-10-10T14:47:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	ok, im
2005-10-10T14:48:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	this device does not auto mount, and when i try <mount usbfs -t /dev/sda /mnt/sda>  i get unkniwn file type
2005-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 is this a cdrom drive? or hard drive or what?
2005-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	flash drive i believe.....its not mine...im remotly connected......but its whooping me, and i determined to fix
2005-10-10T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 well im just guessing  but - bet /dev/sda is WRONG.. it may be /dev/sda1
2005-10-10T14:50:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	i cant try that
2005-10-10T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 use fdisk -l /dev/sda and see what partions are on the drive
2005-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	it is sda1   but <mount usbfs -t /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda> still give me unknown file type
2005-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 you may want to look Closely at that mount command.. I think its wrong.
2005-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	well, so far, that is the only command that has given my any sort of promising results
2005-10-10T14:53:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	i did...it is fat16, i said fat16, still gives me the same thing
2005-10-10T14:54:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	jsut fat didnt work either..........i will try again...lost my connection for a second
2005-10-10T14:55:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	i have no ida, its not mine.....but i lost my connection ne ways....so im done for tomarrow
2005-10-10T14:55:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	TILL tomarrow..........
2005-10-10T14:55:00.000Z	Gwildor	Dr_Willis	thank you ever so much......laters
2005-10-29T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gwildor	 i think its more of a "I know a lot.. just not a whole lot" kinda issue.
