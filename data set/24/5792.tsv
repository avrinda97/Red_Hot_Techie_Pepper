2008-09-07T10:28:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	what is your questions about ltsp?
2008-09-07T10:29:00.000Z	klos		i was wondering about how desktop effects and stuff
2008-09-07T10:29:00.000Z	klos		does it work thru ltsp ?
2008-09-07T10:29:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	no I don't think it does.  don't think you would want it too.
2008-09-07T10:29:00.000Z	klos		ic
2008-09-07T10:30:00.000Z	klos	jgedeon	im thinking about building a myth tv box. and thought about running all my pc applications off this one aswell using ltsp
2008-09-07T10:30:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	your basically sending all graphics over the network to a thinclient with minimal hardware \
2008-09-07T10:30:00.000Z	klos		i could save enrgy and space etc, how do you think it would work, having one server serving my whole unit
2008-09-07T10:31:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	you could do that but you won't have the desktop effects.
2008-09-07T10:31:00.000Z	klos		i prolly have one or two apple tvs as myth tv frontend and a thin client for my computing needs
2008-09-07T10:31:00.000Z	klos		yea doenst matte rbaout the effects :)
2008-09-07T10:31:00.000Z	jgedeon		Not sure how much media you would be piping either.
2008-09-07T10:32:00.000Z	klos		is there anything i have to consider when buying a thin client ? i think the only thing they have to be able to is to boot thru the network, is this right ?
2008-09-07T10:33:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	pretty much.  there are a couple websites that you can find from google that will tell you what true thin clients work out of the box and what to avoid.
2008-09-07T10:33:00.000Z	klos		ok do you know any vendors who seel some nice thin clients, some less geek looking :)
2008-09-07T10:33:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	for my classrooms I use older school hardware and for the daycares I use true thinclients.
2008-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	I don't think any of the thinclients look geek looking..  Heck you can mount them under the desk or table and no one sees them..
2008-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	klos		:)
2008-09-07T10:35:00.000Z	jgedeon	klos	google and ebay are friends!  LOL
2008-09-07T10:35:00.000Z	klos		ok no worries
2008-09-07T10:35:00.000Z	klos		thnaks for your time
2008-09-07T10:36:00.000Z	klos		:)
