2005-12-13T08:12:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	so what command did you try to execute?
2005-12-13T08:14:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	well, bash doesn't seem to do anything if you're already running it so that should be ok.
2005-12-13T08:14:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	sudo cat /etc/sudoers
2005-12-13T08:14:00.000Z	BenUrban	Jowi	nothing
2005-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	yes
2005-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	you should also have %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
2005-12-13T08:22:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	that'll make members of the admin group being able to use sudo
2005-12-13T08:25:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	so create it :) and add yourself to it
2005-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	admin is 4 for me
2005-12-13T08:27:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	argh, sorry, misread. you're right
2005-12-13T08:28:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	should be "admin" is 109
2005-12-13T08:28:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	"id" should list them all
2005-12-13T08:28:00.000Z	BenUrban	Jowi	109 is messagebus
2005-12-13T08:29:00.000Z	Jowi	BenUrban	shouldn't matter which gid you use i think.
