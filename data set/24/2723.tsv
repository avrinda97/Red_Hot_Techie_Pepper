2010-08-26T04:20:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	what type of video card?
2010-08-26T04:21:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I can't remember what video card
2010-08-26T04:22:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	lspci  in a terminal will show you.
2010-08-26T04:22:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	it's Radeon X1200

2010-08-26T04:24:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I saw that. but my ttys are running according to ps aux
2010-08-26T04:25:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I didn't mess with this solution because I assumed ps wouldn't show tty running if I had this problem. do you think I should try it?
2010-08-26T04:26:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	I would atleast check if the conf files are there.
2010-08-26T04:26:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	they should be in /etc/init/
2010-08-26T04:27:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	and you probably want them on runlevel 2345

2010-08-26T04:29:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	hrm... and they are running..  Thats odd. Perhaps a video issue with switching resolutions or something goofy with karmic.
2010-08-26T04:29:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	maybe someone else may know more.
2010-08-26T04:32:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I think it is a video issue. thing is, I had so much trouble getting this video card working, I really don't want to change it. perhaps I should just bite the bullet and make the switch to Lucid. thanks anyway
2010-08-26T04:33:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	yeah why are you running karmic anyhoot?
2010-08-26T04:34:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	if you don't trust lucid you should check out Hardy then
2010-08-26T04:42:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I was happy with Hardy, but had some problems with the broadcom wifi support that was addressed with Jaunty. IDK why I upgraded to karmic -- probably because I think koalas are cute. I do trust Lucid, I run Lucid Kubuntu on my home desktop, I haven't had the time to fix my computer if the upgrade to lucid doesn't work on my laptop
2010-08-31T01:14:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	is the printer shared?
2010-08-31T01:14:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	yes. shared by the win7 machine
2010-08-31T01:14:00.000Z	histo	benbloom	you should be able to add the network printer then.  Make sure samba is installed
2010-08-31T01:15:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	samba is installed and current, but nothing's showing up when I ask cups to search for shared printers.
2010-08-31T01:19:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I get this NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE message
2010-08-31T01:21:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	I did disconnect firewalls, but that's not helping. I can browse files on the workgroup via smb client but only after entering the password. cups doesn't let me input a password
2010-08-31T01:37:00.000Z	benbloom	histo	you still there?
