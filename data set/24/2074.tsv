2009-07-29T16:46:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	even a dual core machine could be 32 bit
2009-07-29T16:46:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	intel
2009-07-29T16:46:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	yes.. but the point is if his machine isn't 64 bit then no matter how hard you try you won't load a 64 bit os
2009-07-29T16:54:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	I have the same issue with gparted on 8.04.. it says unallocated for the drive despite it having 5 partitions.. ubuntu boots but windows won't anymore.. :(
2009-07-29T16:54:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	you should restart partition manager again , itoo faced same issues with my seagate
2009-07-29T16:54:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	or reboot live cd again
2009-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	or i think i tried typing parted in terminal
2009-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	what is the problenm you have?
2009-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	windows doesn't boot anymore.. no worries there.. but I want to shrink the parititon to make more room for ubuntu (already installed).. I might have to use the live cd.. even starting gparted from terminal results in nothing
2009-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	try with sudo
2009-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	same
2009-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	what does mount tell u
2009-07-29T16:57:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	i suggest using gparted live cd then
2009-07-29T16:58:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	gparted loads but doesn't recognize the drive as being partitioned
2009-07-29T16:58:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	hmm
2009-07-29T16:58:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	how many partitions? what does mount tell u?
2009-07-29T16:58:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	also mount -a u tried?
2009-07-29T16:59:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	sudo fdisk -l shows 8 partitions
2009-07-29T17:05:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	does that run a diagnostic on the drive?
2009-07-29T17:09:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	you installed?
2009-07-29T17:10:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	installed and run.. it's telling me to reboot
2009-07-29T17:10:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	ok sure
2009-07-29T17:10:00.000Z	scunizi	indus	back shortly
2009-07-29T17:10:00.000Z	indus	scunizi	but i think u try live cd now?
