2005-09-01T14:15:00.000Z	cloudr		where can I find a repository with gaim 1.5 ?
2005-09-01T14:17:00.000Z	cloudr		How do I turn off CPU frequency scaling? see http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=60262
2005-09-01T14:18:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	'cd /proc/acpi/processor' have a peek.
2005-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	acpi id:1
2005-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	if it doesn't have any support, then disable ACPI completely, via grub.conf, or in the kernel.
2005-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	but I have a mere athlonXP2200
2005-09-01T14:20:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	in grub I tried adding noacpi but I still got the same error on boot up
2005-09-01T14:20:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	it didn't work then.. check your syntax.
2005-09-01T14:22:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	what exactly I am looking for in proc/acpi/processor to find out if it supports ACPI?
2005-09-01T14:23:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	'cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/info'
2005-09-01T14:24:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	interesting i have no CPU0 but I have CPU1 and there it says processor id: 0 acpi id:1 busmastering: yes power manage. yes the rest no
2005-09-01T14:25:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	I modify menu.lst # kopt=root=/dev/hda5 ro adding noacpi and then do update-grub?
2005-09-01T14:25:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	then my suggestion is to check that the option is enabled in BIOS.  If you don't have any option, then what's so harsh about an message informing you that you don't have throttling?  You can disable that option in the kernel if you really want to get picky, and never see the message.
2005-09-01T14:26:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	yeah.. or just disable it completely, which I wouldn't do, since it's good to have when your board supports it.
2005-09-01T14:27:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	I don't want to see the error message and I don't want to break anything so what is the less invasive way?
2005-09-01T14:27:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	close your eyes until gdm displays..
2005-09-01T14:28:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	I will check my bios and and enable it there if if is disabled.
2005-09-01T14:28:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	that wouldnt' help because the STOP error is there after I log on and until I click OK on it
2005-09-01T14:28:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	the error message comes AFTER I log on to gdm
2005-09-01T14:29:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	okay, but just a little FYI: acpi throttling does nothing more than scale the CPU frequency _down_ to save power consumption.. you're probably not missing much.
2005-09-01T14:30:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	Yeah, I am not too fuzzed about having acpi throttling on, just about Ubuntu giving me an error message because of that. It is not a crime if my CPU doesnt' support frequency scaling :-)
2005-09-01T14:30:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	I'd turn acpi off, research it if it'
2005-09-01T14:30:00.000Z	flankk	cloudr	it's that important, and pop a few rids.
2005-09-01T14:31:00.000Z	cloudr	flankk	pop a few rids?
