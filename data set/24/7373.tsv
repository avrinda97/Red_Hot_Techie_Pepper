2005-02-04T13:23:00.000Z	poningru		hey how do I turn on 3dnow and sse in my atholon, for some reason its not enabled
2005-02-04T13:23:00.000Z	poningru		anyone?
2005-02-04T13:24:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	look in the flags of /proc/cpuinfo
2005-02-04T13:41:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	same thing. You need 'mplayer-k7', not 'mplayer-custom'.
2005-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	warty or hoary?
2005-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	usb?
2005-12-26T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	he has Dapper mixed in there somehow
2007-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	hmm thats twice that someone has complained
2007-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	that's because no one tests when I ask them to.
2007-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	sign me up for your list
2007-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	I'll test
2007-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	there's an open invitation for our git tree.  Do tests daily.
2007-05-29T07:34:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	I thought the last update was just a abi version change or something
2007-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	linux-image-foo contains snd-usb-audio.ko, however.
2007-06-04T10:17:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	can I bug you for a quick sec?
2007-06-04T10:18:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	sure, but I may not answer immediately.
2007-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	do you know which package has snd_usb_audio
2007-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	linux-image-foo
2007-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	actually, to be pedantic, none.
2007-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	note that modprobe does not discriminate between hyphens and underscores used in module names.
2007-06-04T10:21:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	hehe gotcha thanks
2007-06-04T10:21:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	for whatever reason the friend you helped yesterday does not have that module
2007-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	crimsun	poningru	he wouldn't have snd_usb_audio.ko or snd_usb_audio, no.  He would have a snd-usb-audio.ko, however.
2007-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	poningru	crimsun	:D right thanks
