2005-05-09T09:46:00.000Z	Absenth		First I get to wrap my head around administering a mixed windows/Unix network.
2005-05-09T09:47:00.000Z	Absenth		I'm inhertiting a network who's previous admin didn't want to know how to manage DNS servers, or anything that wasn't windows.  so all the websites and e-mail addresses we host, have DNS hosted by either Register.com or GoDaddy.
2005-05-09T09:48:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Take four ...
2005-05-09T09:48:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Tum, tum tum tum...
2005-05-09T09:48:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	I'll take two more after I duct tape my head back together.
2005-05-09T09:50:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	I think I've got it...
2005-05-09T09:50:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	you maketh the heart grow fonderth.
2005-05-09T09:52:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Sure.  Install bind9.  Chroot it if you're smart.
2005-05-09T09:52:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	It's pretty much the same code.  I've had my say on OpenBSD vs. Debian (or Ubuntu as it were).  If you're comfortable with OBSD, use it.
2005-05-09T10:05:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Have you heard the joke about the American, the German, and the Japanese businessman on the golf course?

2005-05-09T10:06:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	...you'll get to the fax bit in the end.
2005-05-09T10:08:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	That's great.
2005-05-09T10:08:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	;-)
2005-05-09T10:09:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	I think the blackberry is as connected as I'd like to get.
2005-05-09T10:09:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	as far as in touch with others that is.
2005-05-09T10:10:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Well, there's ways of being connected which are closer, but not electronically mediated.
2005-05-09T10:10:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	Personally, I prefer a wall phone ;-)
2005-05-09T10:10:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	I'm doomed to have brain, and hip cancer.  Worse things could happen.
2005-05-09T10:11:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	C sucks massive eggs.
2005-05-09T10:17:00.000Z	karsten	Absenth	German toggles 'y' and 'z'.  Also adds some shift chars for  umlaut, etc.
2005-05-09T10:17:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	I knew it was Z and something I used semi frequently.
2005-05-09T10:17:00.000Z	Absenth	karsten	it took me a lot longer to type my two paragraph home then it should have.
