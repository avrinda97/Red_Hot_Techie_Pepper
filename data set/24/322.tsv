2011-11-26T12:41:00.000Z	poyntz		hi all
2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	poyntz		is it possible to install oneiric without overriding grub?
2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	poyntz		so I could install off live CD, but then, if it overrides the current grub, I'd then have to reinstall windows 7?
2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	If GRUB is already installed, it should auto-detect other installations. It should search for Windows and Ubuntu.
2011-11-26T12:43:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	it does :), but I borked my kubuntu installation when I tried to upgrade to oneiric
2011-11-26T12:44:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	so if I install oneiric from a live CD, will that use the current grub?
2011-11-26T12:44:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	It will most likely install GRUB again, but that GRUB should list Windows and Ubuntu as bootables too.
2011-11-26T12:45:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	I am not familiar with oneirc and so I cannot say for sure.
2011-11-26T12:45:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	will it still be my primary partition? aka will boot point to grub or the windows one?
2011-11-26T12:45:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	Ah, I feel pretty dumb now. If you're looking to update your current installation, simply do so via the update manager.
2011-11-26T12:46:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	I tried that, it screwed up kubuntu, and not entirely sure what it screwed up specifically. all i know is that basic linux commands were throwing errors
2011-11-26T12:47:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	additionally I couldn't install the latest graphic driver for linux x64
2011-11-26T12:48:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	Are you using GRUB or the Windows boot loader?
2011-11-26T12:48:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	currently grub
2011-11-26T12:48:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	grub was unaffected by the upgrade
2011-11-26T12:48:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	I'm not too experienced with full upgrades, I generally wipe the old installation and install the newer distro.
2011-11-26T12:49:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	do you dual boot?
2011-11-26T12:49:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	I hope someone else can help you, I personally don't have enough experience to give you good advice.
2011-11-26T12:49:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	I run multiple hard drives and install different boot loaders. I've had too many issues with dual-booting.
2011-11-26T12:50:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	my fear is that when you dual boot the older of the two OS's hijacks boot loader
2011-11-26T12:50:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	Your Windows bootloader was already over-written, so at this point as GRUB is the main boot loader, installing a new distro shouldn't affect it much.
2011-11-26T12:51:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	When GRUB is installed, it scans for other OS partitions and lists them as bootable. Theoretically, installing a new distro would just change the boot list.
2011-11-26T12:52:00.000Z	poyntz	Scott_S	so, the partition which currently hosts boot loader will still host bootloader if I install the latest kubuntu from a live-CD?
2011-11-26T12:53:00.000Z	Scott_S	poyntz	Theoretically, yes. Just keep in mind I am not 100% sure and I would prefer if you got better info from #kubuntu or someone else here who has more experience.
