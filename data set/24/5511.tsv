2006-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	dershodan	gnomefreak	so how do i edit this file, and where can i ind it?
2006-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dershodan	gksudo gedit ~/.bashrc
2006-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	dershodan	gnomefreak	im just confused about the ~/. =)
2006-06-19T09:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dershodan	~ =home /=to split home from file .bashrc = config file the files in your home that are .file = config files
2006-06-19T09:18:00.000Z	dershodan	gnomefreak	and if i may ask one more (extremely) stupid question: why do all of you "sudo" and not just login as "root" ?
2006-06-19T09:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dershodan	logging in with root is bad thing to do
2006-06-19T09:19:00.000Z	dershodan	gnomefreak	im logging in as root in console, not in x (not THAT stupid) ;)
2006-06-19T09:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dershodan	thats not to bad just edit the file than like gedit ~/.bashrc
2006-06-19T09:22:00.000Z	dershodan	gnomefreak	ok trying it now #
