2007-12-03T05:01:00.000Z	Benalex		Hello all, is the attack on #Ubuntu over ?
2007-12-03T05:03:00.000Z	Benalex		I have been thinking all the day, why would someone create a worm or a virus to attack Ubuntu??..
2007-12-03T05:03:00.000Z	Benalex		anyway... We are already here
2007-12-03T05:05:00.000Z	Benalex		ok.. Can anyone tell me how can I disable Link to prefixing when creating shortcuts?
2007-12-03T05:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	I don't know if there is a preference in nautilus but you can always change the name afterwards or use "ln -s" directly from the terminal
2007-12-03T05:08:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	it says mising parameter
2007-12-03T05:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	The syntax for ln -s is "ln -s /path/to/origianal /path/to/symbolic-link"
2007-12-03T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	A symbolic link in Unix is basically the same as a windows shortcut
2007-12-03T05:10:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	I don't get it , What exactly ln -s does?
2007-12-03T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	It makes symbolic links ( shortcuts ) to files, it does the same thing that right clicking a file in nautilus and choosing "make link" does, but in the terminal instead of the GUI
2007-12-03T05:12:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	... Coool , thank you, I will read the manual of ln... "man ln" right?
2007-12-03T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	Yes
2007-12-03T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	And remember that you want a symbolic link, not a regular link, regular links are not quite the same as shortcuts and can cause interesting problems if you don't understand them
2008-06-17T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2008-06-17T11:01:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	one sec
2008-06-17T11:02:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	no such a file
2008-06-17T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	Make sure you capitalize the 'X' in X11
2008-06-17T11:05:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/m6febf133
2008-06-17T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	first backup your xorg.conf ( and know how to restore it ) then add ' Driver  "intel" ' to the 'device' section
2008-06-17T11:14:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	I did it and nothing changed... should I paste it to you again?
2008-06-17T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	I assume you restarted X?
2008-06-17T11:18:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	I restarted The whol system
2008-06-17T11:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Benalex	Then I don't have any other ideas at the moment
2008-06-17T11:18:00.000Z	Benalex	Jordan_U	thanks for try :)
