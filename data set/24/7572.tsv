2004-10-01T15:10:00.000Z	Treenaks		argh, the ubuntu bugzilla-password mailer trips my spam controls (and mail doesn't get delivered..)
2004-10-01T15:10:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	need to get a better spam filter
2004-10-01T15:10:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	try spamassassin, i've never has a false positive with it
2004-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	I use spamassassin, on postfix.. but it rejects unknown sender domains... and host bugzilla.warthogs.hbd.com does not exist (or the nameserver timeouts)
2004-10-01T15:12:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	weird, it didn't use that domain to send to me. they must be changing the setup
2004-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	you get the bugzilla thing worked out? i checked my password email, and its coming from bugzilla-daemon@bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2004-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	it works now
2004-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	but you have to look at the Return-Path
2004-10-01T15:33:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	which looks broken ..
2004-10-01T15:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	anyway, I've relaxed my postfix checks a bit
2004-10-02T15:45:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	for me, when i select one, it puts a check mark in the box
2004-10-02T15:45:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	or are you talking about something different?
2004-10-03T16:02:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	yes, but you'll need the gstreamer plugin then
2004-10-03T16:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	why not? ffmpeg itself is free..
2004-10-03T16:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	it does? how?
2004-10-13T08:16:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	if I replace sftp:// by ssh:// the links on my desktop suddenly work, and I can still transfer files..
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	sftp:// works fine for me. in fact, if you use the Connect to Server... GUI and select SSH, it uses sftp://
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	yes, that's the strange thing..
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	I can connect to server, everything works fine
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	then I log out, log back in, click the connection link that's on my desktop
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	then it errors on me
2004-10-13T08:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	replacing sftp:// by ssh:// using gconf-editor makes the link work again
2004-10-14T14:59:00.000Z	subterrific	Treenaks	no, this is a known problem
2004-10-14T14:59:00.000Z	Treenaks	subterrific	oh ok
