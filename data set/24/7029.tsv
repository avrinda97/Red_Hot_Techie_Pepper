2005-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	there's a nice google entry on GRUB and RAID
2005-08-08T13:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	no caps, and i'll prove you wrong
2005-08-08T13:37:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	first hit on google
2005-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	yeah, and then use a live CD to edit it all
2005-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	well, it uses UNIX only utilities
2005-08-08T13:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	is there anything wrong with homosexuality?
2005-08-08T13:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	the key lies in mdadm
2005-08-08T13:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	I suggest you do some reading into this, and then come back
2005-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	you have to use mdadm to make md devices that pool the RAID partitions together in a way other software can read it
2005-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	so you used mdadm, and you have your menu.list reflecting the resulting ``md'' devices?
2005-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	stop flooding
2005-08-08T13:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	try adding that in
2005-08-08T13:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	yeah
2005-08-08T13:49:00.000Z	Razor-X	george___	the installer will install the files
