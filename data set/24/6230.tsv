2009-06-14T22:09:00.000Z	jj_		dmesg | tail or so
2009-06-14T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 bad mount command arguments most likely
2009-06-14T22:09:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 how do i correct this?  i have all the backup files on this partition
2009-06-14T22:12:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 anyway to fix this?
2009-06-14T22:12:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 i've tried testdisk and other tools not sure how to fix it...
2009-06-14T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 fix what?  if you use spaces in a directory name you MUST quote the paths or escape the spaces.. thats BASH basics...
2009-06-14T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 oope wrong person. :) heh
2009-06-14T22:13:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 lol
2009-06-14T22:13:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 i mean the messed up partition :P
2009-06-14T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	  use proper mount options/arguments..
2009-06-14T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 how do you even know its messed up? what filesystem is it?
2009-06-14T22:14:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 jfs   well im not sure if its messed up but i cannt mout it :(
2010-08-02T03:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 clarify what you have exactly... and what you mean by 'run'
2010-08-02T03:43:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 install it
2010-08-02T03:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 if you mean 'copy it to a hard drive' you can do that via 'dd' and the proper options. but it may need more work afterwords to be a working system
2010-08-02T03:44:00.000Z	jj_	Dr_Willis	 dd?
2010-08-02T04:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 it installs to the system in the proper directories where it belongs..
2010-08-02T04:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 if you cant find its icon. run it via terminal
2010-08-02T04:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 run it from terminal. your menus havent refreshed most likely
2010-08-02T04:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 'gksudo gparted'  it has to be ran as root anyway
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jj_	 you may want to clarify your 'needs' and let us suggest what you should be doing.
