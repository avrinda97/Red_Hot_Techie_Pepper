2009-07-11T06:10:00.000Z	ohnoes		hey guys, I have a very strange issue... I enabled the 3rd party repositories, but a lot of packages seem to be missing.  For example, when i try to install xchat I get an error that says xchat is not available but referred to by other packages.
2009-07-11T06:10:00.000Z	ohnoes		I'm also getting issues with Gnome-do
2009-07-11T06:10:00.000Z	ohnoes		installing it, that is
2009-07-11T06:12:00.000Z	ohnoes		jezza;  you're doing it wrong.  use the command line and make sure you enabled the third party repositories.  I'm willing to be it's there.  use "aptitude search" to find the package (try "active-sync" or "activesync" or something like that"
2009-07-11T06:14:00.000Z	ohnoes		jezza;  use the 'aptitude search' command
2009-07-11T06:14:00.000Z	ohnoes		like i said above
2009-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	ohnoes		jezza;  Make sure you enable the third party repositories first.  they're under "software sources" in the System>Admin menu

2009-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	ohnoes		anybody know what's up?
2009-07-11T06:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 update, upgrade, try again.
2009-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 i did that already
2009-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 I checked that the repos were enabled, updated, upgraded, etc...
2009-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade,     then try reinstalling xchat.. try it again, or try a dist-upgrade perhaps..
2009-07-11T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 the only time ive ever seen a similer error was when the updates got out of sync
2009-07-11T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 or some repos got disabled some how
2009-07-11T06:17:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 tried dist-upgrade as well
2009-07-11T06:17:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 this is a fresh installation, so i'm a bit confused
2009-07-11T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 perhaps compare to my /etc/apt/sources.list ---> mine for an example --> (lots of stuff added to it) http://pastebin.com/f696cda99
2009-07-11T06:19:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 hmmm i see you enabled backports and proposed.  think that could be it?
2009-07-11T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 no idea. i always tend to just enable everyting. :)
2009-07-11T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ohnoes	 i dont think that would be it however.
2009-07-11T06:20:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 I concur...
2009-07-11T06:21:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 let me pastebin both outputs.  I have a different one for gnome-do and xchat
2009-07-11T06:22:00.000Z	ohnoes	Dr_Willis	 or anybody really... here are the errors I'm getting from apt-get.  http://pastebin.com/m4240056d
