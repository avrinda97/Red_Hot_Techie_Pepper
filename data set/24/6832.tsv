2005-07-04T09:15:00.000Z	synic		anyone use ubuntu on amd64?
2005-07-04T09:16:00.000Z	synic		I just got the latest kernel update, and now I can't boot my system.
2005-07-04T09:16:00.000Z	synic		"VFS: can't mount root fs" when trying to boot.
2005-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	mai	synic	sounds like a bad initrd image
2005-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	mai	synic	did you compile it yourself?
2005-07-04T09:17:00.000Z	synic	mai	nope.
2005-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	mai	synic	hmm, it would have kept the old one (i think), probably just boot off that one for now
2005-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	synic	mai	unfortunately, they are named the same thing.  The old one is gone.
2005-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	synic	mai	so I tried installing the linux-image off of the install cd, no go
2005-07-04T09:18:00.000Z	mai	synic	crap.  try making a new initrd image (run mkinitrd)
2005-07-04T09:19:00.000Z	mai	synic	the old kernel doesn't work, or it wouldn't let you install?
2005-07-04T09:19:00.000Z	synic	mai	it installed fine, but I get the same thing when I reboot
2005-07-04T09:19:00.000Z	mai	synic	hmm, are you sure it's not a corrupt file system or something then?
2005-07-04T09:20:00.000Z	synic	mai	this exact same thing happened the last time I updated the kernel.  I finally got it working, but I can't remember what package I reinstalled
2005-07-04T09:20:00.000Z	mai	synic	hmm, this has never happened to me.  generally when i get that error it's because i compiled my kernel w/out initrd support... you could probably google it though
2005-07-04T09:21:00.000Z	synic	mai	tried that... most of them are people who compiled their own kernels
2005-07-04T09:22:00.000Z	mai	synic	hmm... sorry :(
2005-07-04T09:22:00.000Z	synic	mai	seems to me that security updates shouldn't bring your system down
2005-07-04T09:22:00.000Z	synic		especially two security updates in a row
2005-07-04T09:24:00.000Z	mai	synic	yeah i'm not sure what's up w/ that... i've never had this problem
2005-07-04T09:24:00.000Z	synic	mai	you using amd64?
2005-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	mai	synic	no, i'm just running a p4
2005-07-04T09:25:00.000Z	synic	mai	ah, this hasn't happened on any of my x86 machines
2005-07-04T09:27:00.000Z	mai	synic	oh ok... i don't really know anything about amd64... that sounds like trouble though
