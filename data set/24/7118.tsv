2005-04-20T15:50:00.000Z	willhig		ndiswrapper notes the driver to my wireless card was installed correctly and the hardware is present, but iwconfig / ifconfig do not list wlan0... what do I do if I can't configure wlan0? It acts like it doesn't exist!
2005-04-20T15:51:00.000Z	willhig		??????
2005-04-20T15:51:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	reinsert the card?
2005-04-20T15:53:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	I have to uninstall the driver for the system to boot past "Configuring Network Interfaces"
2005-04-20T15:53:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	do you mean it hangs on ndiswrapper driver at boot?
2005-04-20T15:53:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	 or 'loading ndiswrapper' or whatever?
2005-04-20T15:54:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	that is probably what it is, but it never mentions ndiswrapper
2005-04-20T15:54:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	 sometimes it's the simple things we miss :)
2005-04-20T15:54:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	that sounds like the problem...
2005-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	how do I prevent ndiswrapper from stalling at boot? should I try reinstallation?
2005-04-20T15:56:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	oh!
2005-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	which card is this?  are there any other wifi driver modules loaded?  if so you might need to blacklist them in /etc/hotplug/blacklist then reboot, same for you vessuvius81
2005-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	It's a Linksys WMP54G version 4, the Ralink chipset.
2005-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	I have a thread at http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=112897
2005-04-20T15:59:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	it didn't help
2005-04-21T16:03:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	lsmod|grep ath  -- any output to that?
2005-04-21T16:03:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	I'll try that...
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	are you sure there aren't any other wireless driver modules loaded, i.e. with my dlink it loaded ath_pci native driver and ndiswrapper wouldn't work with it loaded
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	do i had to blacklist it, ath_pci along with it's associated modules
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	I'm looking for wlan0, right?
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	>_<`` I don't know what I'm looking for...
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	you're looking for a module loaded that is for wireless, i know it can be tricky :)
2005-04-21T16:04:00.000Z	stuNNed	willhig	/query ok?
2005-04-21T16:05:00.000Z	willhig	stuNNed	that's fine
