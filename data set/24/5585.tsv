2006-10-28T10:14:00.000Z	aleka		what is the current linux kernel?
2006-10-28T10:15:00.000Z	aleka		should splash be on a new line after the kernel, or is it part of the kernel line ?
2006-10-28T10:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	that should have given the one we have in Ubuntu..., see kernel.org for the latest.
2007-01-27T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	ssh username@its.lan.ip.address
2007-01-27T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	It needs to have opensss-server installed.
2007-01-27T14:04:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	got it.. I had to find out what the local ip was
2007-01-27T14:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	If you have physical access to the box, 'ifconfig', otherwise check the router's admin interface
2007-01-27T14:06:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	question on scp.. once I am connected to the other linux box (ssh), I want to copy one file over to my ubuntu box
2007-01-27T14:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	scp /path/to/file your.ubuntu.box.ip:/path/of/destination
2007-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	scp goes either way with an ssh session on it's own, so you don't need to ssh in first, but if you're logged in that way you can send the other direction too
2007-01-27T14:13:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	I did try doing <</tmp/log mymachine@192.168.1.152:/tmp/log1
2007-01-27T14:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	Did you actually have that << in there?
2007-01-27T14:19:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	is there a GUI scp client for ubuntu like winscp?
2007-01-27T14:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	Places > Connect to server
2007-01-27T14:21:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	the default protocol is public ftp, and I don't have an ftpd running on the other machine.. can I use ssh as the protocol?
2007-01-27T14:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	yep :)
2007-01-27T14:22:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	the window disappeared and nothing happened
2007-01-27T14:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	uh oh!
2007-01-27T14:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	Okay, now look in Places again.  There should be an entry for the IP.  Click that, and you'll get a prompt for password, at which point you'll get connected and a share window will open.
2007-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	Can I ask you another question.. something I have googled, asked about and haven't found an answer for?
2007-01-27T14:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	You can sure try!
2007-01-27T14:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	That is very weird indeed.  Have your searches already included the forums?
2007-01-27T14:32:00.000Z	aleka	tonyyarusso	I was searching for my video card and linux issues, videocard and brightness isuues on google.. and I couldn't find anything relevant
2007-01-27T14:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aleka	I'd suggest trying ubuntuforums.org, and if that doesn't work, the mailing list (ubuntu-users, see lists.ubuntu.com).  You'll probably have to find someone with the same card :(
