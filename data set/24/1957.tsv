2009-08-02T22:41:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	 sudo apt-get -f -y install envyng-qt envy-gtk
2009-08-02T22:43:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	Couldn't find package envy-gtk
2009-08-02T22:43:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	Why am I having to install anything at all? I've installed ubuntu at least 20 times and I've never had this problem
2009-08-02T22:44:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	 You have an Nvidia graphic cars, envy is a gui frontend to install the nvidia drivers without a headache
2009-08-02T22:48:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	Sounds like you have done this a few times, after installing the restriced modus you can not issue gksudo nvidia-settings and configure the right res?
2009-08-02T22:48:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	No. I can't.
2009-08-02T22:50:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	What version of ubuntu?
2009-08-02T22:50:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	9.04
2009-08-02T22:51:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	I don't see a single option for forcing a resolution or adding a resolution in the nvidia settings thing. All I see is a drop down that shows different resolutions but the one I need isn't on the list and the wiki link I was given didn't work
2009-08-02T22:53:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	sounds like quite a pickle, what is the card model?

2009-08-02T22:53:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	Also if you run out of options, try mu sugested envy optn, it may help you out.
2009-08-02T22:54:00.000Z	Heather	geekhut	No. It will not.
2009-08-02T22:54:00.000Z	geekhut	Heather	Thsn sorry - I can offer no further options.
