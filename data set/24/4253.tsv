2007-05-31T12:08:00.000Z	lockd		i entered this command and qemu refuses to boot the partition: qemu -boot c -hda /dev/sda1
2007-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	lockd		anyone?
2007-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	i'm prettysure qemu doesnt do partition install only images created with qemu command
2007-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	ouch
2007-05-31T12:10:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	well, it did, but only with a botched partition
2007-05-31T12:10:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	i stuck the qemu image into the partition itself - unfortunately Windows can't boot those
2007-05-31T12:11:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	now, I have a normal partition, I guess I will be stuck dual booting
2007-05-31T12:11:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	yeah or maybe vmware
2007-05-31T12:12:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	I assume the running off a real partition is patented by vmware
2007-05-31T12:13:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	not sure sorry
2007-05-31T12:14:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	thought VMWare was closed source and cost a bundle
2007-05-31T12:14:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	if so, I'm tempted to get my old copy of disasm
2007-05-31T12:14:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	I thought they had released vmware free now but dont quote me on that
2007-05-31T12:19:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	hey, there's a new feature in qemu which adds this, cool
2007-05-31T12:19:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	otherwise it requires a whole /disk/
2007-05-31T12:19:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	cool
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	have you got a link to info on the qemu new feature
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	it's apparently in the cvs, as an experimental patch
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	ah ok cheers
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	checkinstall ftw
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	vmware does nil
2007-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	lockd	noiesmo	it requires some arcane file, which by definition can't be a disk image or a disk
2007-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	oh
2007-05-31T12:26:00.000Z	noiesmo	lockd	me22 got go catch u's later good luck sorting everything
