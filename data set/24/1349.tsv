2010-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	c_nick		I was trying to copy a folder from one pc to another.. i did scp -rf /location to my folder username@ipaddress/
2010-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	c_nick		but it always gave errors
2010-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	: scp -rf /locallocation user@ip:/distantlocation
2010-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	Skeptik		rag : r u sur this is the same hard drive u r looking at ? ;)
2010-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	i get permisson denied
2010-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	i had tried with sudo also
2010-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	are u sure there is a working ssh server on the distant host ?
2010-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	c_nick		yeah i can connect to it
2010-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	Skeptik		rag : sorry never had such troubles with gparted
2010-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	c_nick		i am trying to store in /var over there maybe thats the issue
2010-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	then may be u don't have write permission on the distant location
2010-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	i know the password
2010-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	Skeptik		yes the password is one thing but do you have write permission on the distant folder ?
2010-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	 how to find that out
2010-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	Skeptik		do a ls -l on the distant host and check if your user has a "w" in the rights field
2010-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	c_nick		at the location
2010-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	c_nick		hmm ok
2010-02-24T13:47:00.000Z	c_nick		ok Skeptik i created a folder there which is my folder.. and its rights in the U is rwx
2010-02-24T13:47:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	ok then your scp should accept to write in here
2010-02-24T13:48:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	done..
2010-02-24T13:48:00.000Z	c_nick		i suppose it required 0777
2010-02-24T13:48:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	700 would be enough
2010-02-24T13:49:00.000Z	c_nick	Skeptik	 it was 700 earlier
2010-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	Skeptik	c_nick	then u r not writing with the user u think u r, but with others most probably
