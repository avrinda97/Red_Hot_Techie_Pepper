2008-04-07T01:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	that's outlined in the ifconfig docs. try "man ifconfig"
2008-04-07T01:13:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	In terminal
2008-04-07T01:13:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	yes
2008-04-07T01:15:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	thanks :) Is it possible for for an example make a new interface in monitor mode and then switch to that when I need it?
2008-04-07T01:16:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	you can have a config file to load if you want, but I don't know how to do it\. or have 2 devices. are you on a switched lan?
2008-04-07T01:17:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	What do you mean? I'm on Wlan
2008-04-07T01:17:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	oh, you want to snoop?
2008-04-07T01:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	yeah, try a different config file, and you can load it when you need it
2008-04-07T01:18:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	What do you mean by snoop? I'm testing my own wireless..
2008-04-07T01:18:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	Any documentation on that? :)
2008-04-07T01:19:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	whether legal or not, it's it's snooping. I'm sure there is. have you been through all of the ifconfig man pages, the info pages and googled what you want to do?
2008-04-07T01:19:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	you want to pull packets from some other connection, correct?
2008-04-07T01:20:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	No not yet, as I'm not certain what exactly what I'm looking for:) But Yes I want to snoop my own network.
2008-04-07T01:21:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	check out ethereal
2008-04-07T01:22:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	Yes that's what I want :)
2008-04-07T01:22:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	Thanks :)
2008-04-07T01:23:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	no problem. have fun!!
2008-04-07T01:24:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	Thanks :) Other things I should look at?
2008-04-07T01:24:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	wireshark is a good program, and you could also do a google/linux search for wep cracking if you'd like to see why you shouldn't use it
2008-04-07T01:26:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	I have that ;) (Not WEP crack though) but any documentation of sorts?
2008-04-07T01:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	I would suggest browsing tldp.org because it's all there in one place with a lot of how-to docs
2008-04-07T01:27:00.000Z	eax	Seven_Six_Two	Thanks a lot :) Have a good night :)
2008-04-07T01:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	eax	you too
