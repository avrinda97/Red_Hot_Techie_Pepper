2011-03-25T18:55:00.000Z	dyd		if i go to to a console pressing ctrl+alt+f1 how do i go back to graphical mode? is it ctrl+alt+f what?
2011-03-25T18:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	alt+f7 or f8
2011-03-25T18:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	you don't need ctrl since you are already in text mode
2011-03-25T18:56:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	ctrl was added in graphical mode just to make a difference since alt+f1 and f2 are gnome shortcuts :D
2011-03-25T18:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	chmod changes permissions, chown changes owner... do you need more details?
2011-03-25T19:07:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	chmod -R 0755 somefolder
2011-03-25T19:09:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	yes -R is pretty much universal
2011-03-25T19:21:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	every file and folder need to have user and group
2011-03-25T19:22:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	though you can set different permissions for user, group and others
2011-03-25T19:24:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	access it from where?
2011-03-25T19:26:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	he access with FTP; i am navigating to that folder but can't browse it
2011-03-25T19:26:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	is the user you are trying to log in with a member of ftp group?
2011-03-25T19:27:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	i've tried to add it to FTP but it seems it didn't work
2011-03-25T19:28:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	`su user` and then issue `groups`
2011-03-25T19:30:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	probably i have to logout/in cause i see my name listed in FTP only in graphical, but in the shell is like if i'm not in the group
2011-03-25T19:31:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	did you relog every time when you change something?
2011-03-25T19:31:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	no, i think this is the reason of fail?
2011-03-25T19:31:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	just to be on the safe side, try reloging... but I doubt
2011-03-25T19:45:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	reloggin back in worked, now i'm part of ftp group
2011-03-25T19:45:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	change owner to that group and then change permission to g=rwx
2011-03-25T19:46:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	then chown ftp -R /var/ftp/band ? i've tried that, but then i can't browse neither with main account and mine
2011-03-25T19:48:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	you set owner with `chown user:group -R folder` and then permissions `chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx -R folder`
2011-03-25T19:48:00.000Z	MeanEYE	dyd	or as jjp said :group
2011-03-25T19:49:00.000Z	dyd	MeanEYE	jjp: great, it worked ;)
