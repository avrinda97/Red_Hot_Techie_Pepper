2005-09-18T14:10:00.000Z	Bjerrk		How do i make sure that a certain script is run at boot?
2005-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	add the script with update-rc.d
2005-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	could you be a little more specific? :)
2005-09-18T14:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	a better solution is adding a script local with update-rc.d an make the things you want to do there like calling other scripts
2005-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	you make a script  /etc/init.d/local
2005-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	then you make it to run at boot time with update-rc.d
2005-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	BUT HOW?
2005-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	run update-rc local defaults
2005-09-18T14:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	run "update-rc.d local defaults" sorry
2005-09-18T14:17:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	and that's presuming that my script is called local?
2005-09-18T14:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	yes, i have this script named local to tweak /proc and call other scripts at boot time
2005-09-18T14:19:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	thanks
2005-09-18T14:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	you are wellcome
2005-09-18T14:29:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	it didn't wirk :(
2005-09-18T14:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	it works for me... i don't know what can be the problem
2005-09-18T14:32:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	i just made a script saying:
2005-09-18T14:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	has the script execution bit? chmod +x /etc/init.d/local
2005-09-18T14:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	the script should look like this:
2005-09-18T14:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	yes it shoul be executable and root owned ;)
2005-09-18T14:37:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	is it important that it is owned by root?
2005-09-18T14:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	not sure but init script are root job
2005-09-18T14:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	all the scripts in there are owned by root so ...
2005-09-18T14:40:00.000Z	Bjerrk	erUSUL	how do i make it executable? by addind the ....bin/sh... line?
2005-09-18T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bjerrk	and then chmod +x <script>
