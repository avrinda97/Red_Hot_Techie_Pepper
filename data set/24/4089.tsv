2007-07-13T13:31:00.000Z	henn_tech		Hey guys. I've got a really old laptop here.  I need to install linux on it.  It's got 32mb RAM, 1.4GB of storage, and Intel Pentium 150mhz.  I've been having difficulty thus far getting anything to install, can anyone give me some suggestions?
2007-07-13T13:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	you'r e gonna want to look at ultra light distros for that, slackware, dsl, puppy
2007-07-13T13:33:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	slackware has given me troubles so far. I havent tried dsl or puppy yet
2007-07-13T13:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	if those dont do it, look at Vector
2007-07-13T13:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	personally, of the 4, i'd probably want DSL, but thats just opinion(DSL stands for Damn Small Linux)
2007-07-13T13:34:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	I've tried Vector and Slackware, both have given me problems.  I'll try dsl next.  thanks for the tips
2007-07-13T13:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	no prob, if Dsl or Puppy doesn't go, maybe that one that starst with a Z.. can't remember the name of it.
2007-07-13T13:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		supposed to be really light
2007-07-13T13:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	zenwalk, thats it.
2007-07-13T13:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		i think its built around slack, so you might have probs with it alos.
2007-07-13T13:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		also.
2007-07-13T13:36:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	k, thanks again.
2007-07-13T13:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	no prob, good luck....
2007-07-13T13:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	i actually forgot about fluxbuntu, if you're wanting to try an ubuntu derivative
2007-07-13T13:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		it would run on that machine
2007-07-13T13:39:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	i've been trying fluxbuntu, but it appears it only comes in Live CD? and it won't load on the laptop
2007-07-13T13:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	no, it should have an alternate install cd, i'm pretty sure, hang on
2007-07-13T13:40:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	k
2007-07-13T13:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	sorry, i thought it dd, guess it doesn
2007-07-13T13:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		t
2007-07-13T13:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	you could install ubuntu server edition(which is a CLi system), then install flux ontop of it.
2007-07-13T13:42:00.000Z	henn_tech	IndyGunFreak	k, i will try that as well
2007-07-13T13:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	thats the direction i'd go, ease of ubuntu, light weight of flux.
2007-07-13T13:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	henn_tech	once you get the cli system installed, all you'd have to do is sudo apt-get install fluxbox(i think), and it would provide you with the fluxbox gui
