2009-09-24T08:06:00.000Z	brianV		thanks, ctmjr
2009-09-24T08:08:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	your welcome you might want too google it to see how to set it up it's been a long time since i played with it
2009-09-30T05:30:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	how did you install the driver?
2009-09-30T05:41:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	try the newer driver from nvidia 185  http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_amd64_185.18.36.html disable the restricted driver first tho
2009-09-30T05:42:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	ok, that's my next step
2009-09-30T05:44:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	with a 64-bit OS, should I be downloading the AMD64 driver, or IA64?
2009-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	the AMD64 driver
2009-09-30T06:29:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	did you install the drivers from nvidia?
2009-09-30T06:30:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	yep. Same issue - once X tried to start, monitor lost signal, the fan on the card shut off, and the system was unresponsive
2009-09-30T06:30:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	same as when I attemp it through envyng and the restricted driver manager
2009-09-30T06:32:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	join #nvidia channel and see if someone in there can help you have to many drivers installed and envyng is bad
2009-09-30T06:33:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	I am in there now. Can't raise a soul though, think they are all asleep :p
2009-09-30T06:36:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	yea that channels is pretty funny you either get alot of help or none first thing i would do is remove envyng unistall the restricted driver and the nvidia driver and reinstall the nvidia driver from their web site
2009-09-30T06:36:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	that is what I just did. I removed all the nvidia* packages prior to installing from the website
2009-09-30T06:37:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	sudo apt-get --purge remove envyng
2009-09-30T06:38:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	the fact that the same bug occurs regardless of which form of the driver I try makes me wonder if it's something system-specific
2009-09-30T06:38:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	ie, a hardware issue of some sort
2009-09-30T06:40:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	could be do you have another os installed so you can check the card
2009-09-30T06:40:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	unfortunately, no. However, I got this card to replace a GeForce 7300 which had been doing the same thing
2009-09-30T06:45:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	what does the output of sudo  nvidia-xconfig give you if anything
2009-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	that doesn't work, because I no longer have the driver installed
2009-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	if the driver is installed, I can't boot into X
2009-09-30T06:51:00.000Z	ctmjr	brianV	if you can get a gui with the nv driver then the system is working it's the nvidia drivers that are messing you up i do not know what to tell you other than keep checking in #nvidia for help
2009-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	brianV	ctmjr	ok, well, I'll keep trying in there. Thanks for the help!
