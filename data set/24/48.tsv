2012-09-25T07:42:00.000Z	minetruly		Hi there! I'm new, so please let me know if I make any mistakes.
2012-09-25T07:43:00.000Z	minetruly		mtelsha: thanks :)
2012-09-25T07:43:00.000Z	minetruly		I'm trying to create a bootable USB stick with 12.04. I successfully moved the USB option to the top in BIOS, but I get the error message "Invalid or damaged Bootable partition."
2012-09-25T07:44:00.000Z	minetruly		I tried reformatting the USB drive to FAT and NTFS. I downloaded UNetBootin, which asked me to reformat to FAT32, which I did, but UNetBootin is failing to recognize the USB drive.
2012-09-25T07:44:00.000Z	minetruly		It suddenly strikes me I should try a different USB drive.
2012-09-25T07:45:00.000Z	minetruly		What should I use?
2012-09-25T07:45:00.000Z	minetruly		pendrivelinux ? I'll try that.
2012-09-25T07:46:00.000Z	minetruly		This is my first time installing Linux.
2012-09-25T07:47:00.000Z	jhkier	minetruly	install is easy.. using is a bit of learning curve..
2012-09-25T07:47:00.000Z	jhkier		mtelesha; i get it... its like a personal pc in your pocket.
2012-09-25T07:47:00.000Z	minetruly		I want to try Ubuntu before I reformat my entire hard drive.
2012-09-25T07:48:00.000Z	minetruly		(I'm fed up with Windows and willing to learn all sorts of things to use Linux.)
2012-09-25T07:49:00.000Z	minetruly		Do you still rec pendrivelinux?
2012-09-25T07:50:00.000Z	minetruly		"wubi"?
2012-09-25T07:50:00.000Z	jhkier		do any of you guys have experience (basic) with apache... i'm just curious about the format of sites enabled files.
2012-09-25T07:50:00.000Z	minetruly		OK, downloading Wubi
2012-09-25T07:51:00.000Z	minetruly		I don't have to erase any of what's already on my PC's boot drive, do I?
2012-09-25T07:52:00.000Z	minetruly		I like the hard drive solution. Part of what I'm testing is its speed.
2012-09-25T07:52:00.000Z	jhkier	minetruly	if you've never done linux before, easist I have found is http://www.linuxliveusb.com/
2012-09-25T07:52:00.000Z	minetruly		Thank you jhkier
2012-09-25T07:53:00.000Z	jhkier		very simple windows program that creates it for you and ads a persistant
2012-09-25T07:53:00.000Z	minetruly		Oh yes, when I install it for good I'll keep the ability to dual boot.
2012-09-25T07:53:00.000Z	minetruly		I just thought you had to reformat the hard drive to do that.
2012-09-25T07:54:00.000Z	minetruly	jhkier	what's up with these sites?
