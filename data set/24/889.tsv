2011-01-13T21:43:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	what is a middle click duplicate?
2011-01-13T21:43:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	see above ^^
2011-01-13T21:44:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	get a better mouse ;-)
2011-01-13T21:44:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	this one's great for what I do...
2011-01-13T21:44:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	I presume you're talking about emulating the accessibility feature in windows that allows you to ignore repeated key and mouse presses within a certain time? this would be a useful thing to have in xinput
2011-01-13T21:45:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	yes, if it could ignore repeated presses, in say, an 1/8th of a second, that would do the trick
2011-01-13T21:45:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	wherever dwell click and so on are managed, that would be the place to write the feature
2011-01-13T21:47:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	ah, right. yes, if it's application specific then it can probably be fixed in that application
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	however, I suspect the feature you mentioned would be of use to people with certain types of disabilities, so if you fancy writing it, I'm sure it could be included
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	it's not app specific, but ff is the only place i middle click (open link in new tab)
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	well, i've never programmed (unless php counts) :)
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	why not just control+left click instead?
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	it's easier
2011-01-13T21:48:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	php and basic both count, but not much ;-)
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	yeah ;)
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	the best thing to do would be to write an extension that stops a tab being opened if there is already a tab with the same URL in it
2011-01-13T21:49:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	yes, that would do the trick perfectly
2011-01-13T21:50:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	call it "coalesce tabs"
2011-01-13T21:50:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	okay, I'll see if I can do that, and if I have any probs, I'll jump on the ff channel, as it's kind of ot here :D
2011-01-13T21:51:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	I would suggest that you give some sort of visual feedback (such as pulsing the existing tab
2011-01-13T21:51:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	flashing the existing tab, rather than just silently ignoring it
2011-01-13T21:51:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	yes, good point
2011-01-13T21:54:00.000Z	ne2k	bencahill	I remember spending twenty minutes downloading a 200kB image from a BBS on my 2400 baud modem
2011-01-13T21:57:00.000Z	bencahill	ne2k	i'm only old enough to remember 56k modems (and sometimes slightly less connection speed), which I always remembered as 15MB/hr, iirc
