2009-12-23T04:00:00.000Z	DarkHelmut		are there any tools available to convert my m4p (iTunes files) to mp3?
2009-12-23T04:00:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	did you try ffmpeg?
2009-12-23T04:01:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	I thought I did...  I will take a look right now though.  It has that ability I take it?
2009-12-23T04:02:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	ffmpeg -formats
2009-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	Means it can decode your mp4 and encode to mp3
2009-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	excellent news, thank you much!
2009-12-23T04:06:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	wait, it's m4p or mp4?
2009-12-23T05:08:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	I thought you said mp4, m4p is a infected (DRM) itnues file.  You can't
2009-12-23T05:08:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	yeah...  :( m4p
2009-12-23T05:09:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	one suggestion I known is to convert them (with itunes) to m4a
2009-12-23T05:09:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	is there a Noteburner or similar software for linux?
2009-12-23T05:09:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	you can look on google, there are some suggestions for converting them.
2009-12-23T05:09:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	I may have to plunk down some cash it seems. very upset I have to pay (again) to access my own dam music.  Lesson learned!
2009-12-23T05:10:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	I've tried everything I can google over the last week, no luck
2009-12-23T05:10:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	http://www.defectivebydesign.org/ =)
2009-12-23T05:11:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	I'm a card carrying member now.  ;)
2009-12-23T05:12:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	hehe, from what I've read, there isn't much you can do.  DRM sucks in every way, for the consumers anyway.
2009-12-23T05:13:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	yup. My other option is to use Audacity and record the stream as I play the files from iTunes via Wine, however Audacity isn't picking up my output
2009-12-23T05:13:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	the oldest trick is to burn them to CD, then rip the CDs.  There are some windows apps that setup a virtual drive, and then allow you to read it.
2009-12-23T05:14:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	yes, none are free, which is ok, but they all seem rather overpriced at $40+
2009-12-23T05:15:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	you could always send apple an invoice for it. :)
2009-12-23T05:15:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	don't think I have many choices though, I may spend some time just looking for what I want and downloading it again (via less than acceptable means).
2009-12-23T05:16:00.000Z	DarkHelmut	Solorvox	Well, many thanks for your help!
2009-12-23T05:16:00.000Z	Solorvox	DarkHelmut	good luck
