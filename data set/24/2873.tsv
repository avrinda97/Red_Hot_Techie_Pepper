2011-02-22T12:37:00.000Z	Chu		Hello?
2011-02-22T12:37:00.000Z	Chu		I'm having problems upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 to Maverick
2011-02-22T12:37:00.000Z	Chu		Could someone help me?
2011-02-22T12:39:00.000Z	Chu		Okay. Hello, I'm having problems upgrading from Lucid to Maverick. I've copied the required files and compressed them for analyses. Could someone help me?
2011-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	What method are you using for upgrading?
2011-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	Chu		I'm using the same method: update manager. I'm unable to Upgrade
2011-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	Chu		If you'd like, I could send in the files
2011-02-22T12:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	what does it say when you try to upgrade?
2011-02-22T12:41:00.000Z	Chu		"An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade: E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages."
2011-02-22T12:42:00.000Z	Chu		I've even tried removing every package not provided by Ubuntu, and yet no luck
2011-02-22T12:43:00.000Z	Chu		Would you like to see the log files? The error asked me to copy them just in case
2011-02-22T12:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	if you pastebin them, sure
2011-02-22T12:44:00.000Z	Chu		Um, I have no idea what pastebin is
2011-02-22T12:44:00.000Z	gaelfx		!pb
2011-02-22T12:45:00.000Z	Chu		Here you go
2011-02-22T12:45:00.000Z	Chu		http://paste.ubuntu.com/570443/
2011-02-22T12:46:00.000Z	Chu		That's from Main.log
2011-02-22T12:49:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	well, I'll tell you how I upgraded. I just used a LiveUSB and installed over my old '/' partition and mounted the same '/home' without formating it
2011-02-22T12:50:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	of course, with that method, you have to reinstall anything special you might have had, but that probably won't be an issue for you
2011-02-22T12:50:00.000Z	Chu	gaelfx	I see. I don't mind reinstalling the software, but unfortunately It'll take ages for me to redownload the ISO. I was hoping for an upgrade method.
2011-02-22T12:51:00.000Z	gaelfx	Chu	even with bittorrent?
2011-02-22T12:52:00.000Z	Chu		Ah, how do I do that? I have disabled Ubuntu Tweak from the software center, but I don't know what else
2011-02-22T12:52:00.000Z	Chu		Software sources*
2011-02-22T12:53:00.000Z	Chu	gaelfx	Even Torrents wouldn't help. It says it'll take over 2 hours. I'm downloading via direct method, since it'd be faster.
