2008-07-03T03:57:00.000Z	visik7		could you suggest me a good audio editor for ubuntu ?
2008-07-03T03:57:00.000Z	chubs_	visik7	audacity
2008-07-03T03:57:00.000Z	visik7	chubs_	it doesn't work
2008-07-03T03:57:00.000Z	visik7		says something like unable to open audio device
2008-07-03T03:57:00.000Z	chubs_		josdell got us both sobersabre :)
2008-07-03T03:58:00.000Z	chubs_	visik7	are you trying to edit something while playing music? or otherwise using your sound server?
2008-07-03T03:58:00.000Z	chubs_	visik7	you'll need to stop using your sound and restart audacity before trying to use it, that could be the problem
2008-07-03T03:59:00.000Z	chubs_		josdell
2008-07-03T03:59:00.000Z	chubs_		josdell: just in case
2008-07-03T03:59:00.000Z	chubs_		you can delete them
2008-07-03T03:59:00.000Z	visik7	chubs_	everything that visible using audio is off
2008-07-03T04:01:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: are you editing it as root?
2008-07-03T04:01:00.000Z	visik7	chubs_	it can't get the audio device
2008-07-03T04:02:00.000Z	chubs_	visik7	there might be a problem with colliding sound servers, are you using ubuntu 8.04?
2008-07-03T04:03:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: why can't you add windows? it's a text file
2008-07-03T04:04:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: are you sure you're root if you can't save it? what sort of error comes up?
2008-07-03T04:04:00.000Z	chubs_		in a command line
2008-07-03T04:06:00.000Z	chubs_		xavura: if you need to do work, just use gftp
2008-07-03T04:06:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: but what does it say when you can't save?
2008-07-03T04:07:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: well if it says you're not root, you're probably not root
2008-07-03T04:08:00.000Z	chubs_		nathan406: sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-07-03T04:08:00.000Z	visik7	chubs_	something like tracktor studio or virtualdj ?
2008-07-03T04:08:00.000Z	chubs_	visik7	i don't have any experience with those, sorry. could be worth a try though
