2009-03-27T21:10:00.000Z	julian_		hi im having a little trouble with my grub
2009-03-27T21:10:00.000Z	julian_		how can i reinstall it so that it rescans my partitions for win installations?
2009-03-27T21:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	next time install all Windows systems before installing a Linux system. Windows insists on installing the windows bootloader and has no idea GRUB exists.
2009-03-27T21:12:00.000Z	julian_	cellofellow	i know so i did a copy of the mbr
2009-03-27T21:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	from the livecd you can do grub-install to install grub in the mbr.
2009-03-27T21:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	grub-update won't add your Windows kernels.
2009-03-27T21:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	pastebin your menu.lst.
2009-03-27T21:16:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	then you can just manually write a new menu option for vista and rename the xp option vista.
2009-03-27T21:19:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	fdisk appears to be in german :P
2009-03-27T21:19:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	I can still understand it, but that's weird to me.
2009-03-27T21:20:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	ok, so there are two ntfs partitions. sda2 and sda5. which ones have which version of windows?
2009-03-27T21:20:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	yeah, I know what they mean I just didn't know fdisk could be localized. :P
2009-03-27T21:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	oh, ok
2009-03-27T21:22:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	there are three Windows menu items in there, and I'm assuming only the second one works?
2009-03-27T21:23:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	change the third to (hd0,4) and see if that works.
2009-03-27T21:23:00.000Z	julian_	cellofellow	sorry i keep forgetting writing your name
2009-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	julian_	cellofellow	i get invalid device
2009-03-27T21:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	hmmm
2009-03-27T21:28:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	can windows boot off of a logical partition?
2009-03-27T21:29:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	yeah, you could do that.
2009-03-27T21:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	maybe you need to set sda5 to be bootable.
2009-03-27T21:31:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	you can tab-complete my name so you don't mispell it.
2009-03-27T21:46:00.000Z	julian_	cellofellow	 :( not working
2009-03-27T21:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	julian_	honestly I'm befuddled.
