2012-08-11T03:09:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle		I'm trying to dualboot Ubuntu and Arch, and i'm really confused as to how to partition my HDD to do so - I've never had a dual boot before, any help?
2012-08-11T03:10:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Can you ask a more specific question?
2012-08-11T03:10:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	I can help.
2012-08-11T03:11:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	Sure
2012-08-11T03:13:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Each distro will have a set of mount points.  These are pointers to partitions.  Each distro needs some mountpoints to boot (specifically / and swap).  Some partitions can be used by more than one distro (swap).  Some cannot.  The whole thing becomes more complicated if you have a separate /home).
2012-08-11T03:14:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	So on the 120 Gb HDD.  You'll need two roots (one for ubuntu, one for arch), an optional /home, and a swap.  The other hdd you can just partition and make mountpoints in the OS's later after they're installed
2012-08-11T03:15:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	for example, if you hibernate ubuntu but then boot arch it will probs not boot well or the hibernation will be lost as best
2012-08-11T03:15:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	he's right about that too
2012-08-11T03:15:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	Okay, I generally powerdown my system when not in use, so that's okay.   So I need to create a root on my 80gb as well?  And Ubuntu wont let me partition with two root labled partitions
2012-08-11T03:16:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	'root' is a mountpoint.  You should just create one big empty partition on the 80Gb.  It is not used as a root partition
2012-08-11T03:17:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Ubuntu won't let you modify partitions that are mounted and the root partition cannot be unmounted
2012-08-11T03:18:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	Currently I'm running on a live cd, so deleting partitions isn't much of a problem.  I'm still confused as to which file system type and mount point to use for the partitions.
2012-08-11T03:18:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Use ext4 for everything.
2012-08-11T03:18:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	 Maybe arch isn't right for me at this time, which is shitty I was really hoping to figure it out.
2012-08-11T03:19:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Arch is hard no doubt.
2012-08-11T03:19:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	But, if you install arch first, use the entire disc, then install Ubuntu.  Ubuntu will give you the option to install side-by-side with arch without messing it up
2012-08-11T03:20:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	The other order does not work because arch does not have such a feature built into their installer (although you can do it manually).
2012-08-11T03:20:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	Each distro installed needs a root and a swap.  So for each installer create an ext4 partition and mount it at root.  Then create a swap for each OS as well
2012-08-11T03:24:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	You need to be more specific about what you are confused about.  Or at least ask a question beside "I'm confused about how to do it"
2012-08-11T03:25:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	 I'm trying to distill it myself down to one or two questions, sorry for being vague.
2012-08-11T03:25:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	That's ok!  Just trying to help you :)
2012-08-11T03:26:00.000Z	TheMadDrizzle	deadmund	 I'm aware of how frustrating it is to try and help someone who says ' uh hey this doesnt work, help? '  I'm an avionics tech... pilots are dumb.
2012-08-11T03:26:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	:)
2012-08-11T03:47:00.000Z	deadmund	TheMadDrizzle	sure
