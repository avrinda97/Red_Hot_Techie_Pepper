2007-11-30T05:01:00.000Z	macele		What is the advantage to building your drivers from source rather than just using the restricted drivers system already implemented in ubuntu?
2007-11-30T05:01:00.000Z	macele		Vid drivers that is...
2007-11-30T05:02:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	mostly you do that if you need to use a custom kernel
2007-11-30T05:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	i havent heard anything to suggest that compiling your video drivers would improve performance over restricted drivers
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	however, there are performance improvements to be had (for games esp) by using a realtime kernel
2007-11-30T05:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	which is what i did, compiled custom kernel, then had to use the nvidia.com drivers
2007-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	I dont know what a realtime kernel is. Can you expand on that a bit?
2007-11-30T05:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	the realtime kernel is basically just the linux kernel with more aggressive timing, its scheduler or clock can be set to run faster
2007-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	a good example is when i installed the ET:QW demo, it mentioned in its readme that a realtime kernel with 1000hz clock setting was recommended
2007-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	cool... I had no idea. Are there plenty of links to be found by google-ing "realtime kernel"?
2007-11-30T05:06:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	oh ya tons, and if u dont wanna compile your own there is also ubuntu's linux-kernel-rt package in the repo
2007-11-30T05:07:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	dont get to choose your options with that package but you get a realtime kernel without having to recompile (which takes a little learning)
2007-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	tho if oyu're serious about getting "under the hood" with your linux system, this guide makes recompiling your kernel relatively easy: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158
2007-11-30T05:08:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	I like to learn. I've been thinking about rolling my own kernel for some time now. I think it's time I learned. Any tips before I plunge into google search madness?

2007-11-30T05:10:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	thx man... i'm reading now.
2007-11-30T05:10:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	doing it with ubuntu makes it relatively painless, the part you'll spend most time on is configuring your kernel (choosing what options to use, or what drivers to compile into the kernel)
2007-11-30T05:11:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	which is better... to compile into the kernel or to add as module? Is it faster to build it into the kernel?
2007-11-30T05:12:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	well, back in the day (5 years ago) it was beneficial to compile into the kernel (the resulting kernel after compiling will be smaller)...but these days with systems having lots of ram and cpu power, u can use modules without any real performance impact
2007-11-30T05:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	i went ahead and compiled in some specific drivers for my hardware tho, just because sometimes modules can be tricky, and in one case i needed a driver compiled in (snd-hda-intel) to work properly
2007-11-30T05:15:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	only thing that kinda scares me is the fact that I have software (fake) raid... I sure don't want to hose that. But I suppose I can just use grub to load the old kernel if I get it wrong and try again.
2007-11-30T05:16:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	actually its a good thing to compile a kernel with raid support (and filesystems) built-in, that way u wont have boot problems (RAID root partition cannot be mounted at boot time without kernel support)
2007-11-30T05:16:00.000Z	Evanlec	macele	im running a software raid too
2007-11-30T05:30:00.000Z	macele	Evanlec	in the tutorial you linked for building a custom kernel, nothing is said about x86 vs x64 systems... Do I need to download a special kernel for 64 bit systems?
