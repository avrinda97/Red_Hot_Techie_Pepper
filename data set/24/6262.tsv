2006-03-20T17:20:00.000Z	jdmpike	selinium	I have my entire family using skype  - it is good for windows
2006-03-20T17:20:00.000Z	jdmpike	selinium	I just love 'nix, and ubuntu, I just can't stand the OSS problems with skype on Linux
2006-03-20T17:21:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	I have got to hit the hay soon. 23:20 here. Have a look at www.seveas.ubuntulinux.nl and there is a dsp switcher there.
2006-03-20T17:22:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	I was about to say that! :)
2006-03-20T17:22:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	Sorry
2006-03-20T17:23:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl   but use a mirror
2006-03-20T17:24:00.000Z	jdmpike	selinium	do you know what the dspwatcher is called?
2006-03-20T17:25:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	skype-dsp-hijacker it is in extras! but like i said you wil need to use one of the mirrors. The repo itself no longer allows downloads..
2006-03-20T17:27:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	I hope this helps. I need to catch some Z's. Up in 6 hours...
2006-03-20T17:27:00.000Z	jdmpike	selinium	yeah, me too - I have no clue how to use this though
2006-03-20T17:28:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	You could always try Seveas, he packaged it! Good night, and good luck!
2006-03-20T17:29:00.000Z	selinium	jdmpike	If you have no luck and are about tomorrow, I will be online all day..
