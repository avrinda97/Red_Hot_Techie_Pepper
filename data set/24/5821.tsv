2006-10-22T11:27:00.000Z	black_13		which release of ubuntu would have a gcc3 and xorg?
2006-10-22T11:27:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	All of them I think. Install the package "gcc-3.4" to get GCC 3.x and xorg is "xserver-xorg"
2006-10-22T11:29:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	as in GCC 3.0, or 3.anything?
2006-10-22T11:29:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	3.3.x would be for the best
2006-10-22T11:30:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	i am provided with the kernel modules from a 3rd part hardware vendor
2006-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	Looks like the package gcc-3.3 contains it. I'd use Dapper (6.06) if I were you. It uses Xorg, as do all releases I think
2006-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	no provide with source
2006-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	isnt dapper the latest?
2006-10-22T11:32:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	Well it is the most stable one. Edgy is still full of problems (from what I hear)
2006-10-22T11:33:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	next qestion the componay i work with provides me a kernel for ther hardware its 2.6.10 derivative
2006-10-22T11:36:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	That has a text based installer for those systems where the graphical live CD won't run (not enough RAM, etc.), and it also contains all of the packages needed to install, rather than downloading some. Also it's partitioner allows LVM and stuff to be used
2006-10-22T11:38:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	If it is a custom kernel then I would say get the full source installed rather than just the headers. That can be done manually from kernel.org or whatever if needed
2006-10-22T11:39:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	unfortunatle the kernel is supplied by the hardware vendor
2006-10-22T11:39:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	That's not unfortunate, since it means you know exactly what kernel you should be using :) (as long as it has source for the kernel you are OK)
2006-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	the are try to protect there investment
2006-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	I mean the Linux kernel source which corresponds to the kernel they have supplied
2006-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	I don't mean their own drivers/software
2006-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	Besides, if they don't then they are violating the GPL since giving you a Linux kernel without source is illegal
2006-10-22T11:42:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	i dont want to get into a gpl war it would impede my paychecks
2006-10-22T11:42:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	I was just saying that for Ubuntu kernels there is a corresponding "linux-headers" package, since not the entire source is needed to compile modules, but for custom kernels I would recommend installing it's full source
2006-10-22T11:44:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	It doesn't matter that much really, just speaking from my experience
2006-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	i understand why they dont provide the source this company does something that revolutionary they put something in kernel that most other places put in user space if it works my life will be much easier
2006-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	black_13	Warbo	if there technology got out they would be ruined they are bout 6 guys
2006-10-22T11:46:00.000Z	Warbo	black_13	I am not concerned with the details really, I was just trying to offer a bit of advice because whenever I have tried to build stuff against a custom kernel I have always needed to install the source
