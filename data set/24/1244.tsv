2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	kutagh		Can you install Vista/7 again on a seperate partition to see if they can read it, and then use that to copy over?
2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	kutagh		not sure but doubt it.
2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	kutagh		I'm not an expert in linux ;)
2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	kutagh		(2010-05-01 16:25:39) kutagh: Okay. Having issues with trying to install Xubuntu 10.04 on my laptop. Inserted the DVD (burned ISO to DVD) and restarted laptop. It then goes on to the language selection menu and the options menu, where I can first pick the language and then choose "Try out Xubuntu without installing", "Install Xubuntu", "Check the disc for errors" and such. At that point, the first two (Try out Xubuntu/Install Xubuntu) just.. hang..
2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	kutagh		Any suggestions? (already tried #xubuntu, no response there)
2010-05-01T19:34:00.000Z	kutagh		Once again guys, I want help with this:

2010-05-01T19:38:00.000Z	kutagh		and arand, that last time I did it, was cause that guest user asked ;)
2010-05-01T19:39:00.000Z	slw	kutagh	actually, I just had a thought
2010-05-01T19:40:00.000Z	kutagh	slw	let me know
2010-05-01T19:40:00.000Z	slw	kutagh	people have been talking about the nomodeset boot option in here. I haven't run into the problem personall, so I haven't really been paying attention to it, but it may be worth a shot.
