2009-11-02T09:17:00.000Z	c4pt		is there a bug in the karmic final image with lvm encrypted filesystems getting stuck in the very last step of the installer at 26% while trying to set users and groups?

2009-11-02T09:19:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Size of the hard drive?
2009-11-02T09:19:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	250gb
2009-11-02T09:20:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	How long did you wait? The installer lack any progress indicators.
2009-11-02T09:20:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	does the standard install cd i386 do lvm encryped volumes or only the alternative cd?
2009-11-02T09:20:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	i waited close to 40 minutes maybe 30 minutes just stuck at 26% on settings users and groups after the grub install
2009-11-02T09:20:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Only alternative discs have the option for lvm (and/or) cryptsetup for full-system encryption.
2009-11-02T09:21:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	so why do you think it just gets stuck with a 26% indicator?
2009-11-02T09:21:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	That does not sound right (especially for 250GB). On other hands, if you were to have 2TB or any large hard drives, it'll take awhile.  Did you md5sum to verify that the disc is well?
2009-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	i think i will re download the alternative cd.....
2009-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Check the ISO first.
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	its a shame the wubi installer doesnt have an lvm option.
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Wubi? :0
2009-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	so which utility do you think i should use to do an md5 check on the cd?
2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Whatever is available and accessible to the Ubuntu ISO -- But you're using Wubi. There could be known bugs (related to Wubi).
2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	im not using wubi....
2009-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	If you're using Windows at the moment, then use the Windows method.
2009-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	i looked at the wubi installer for maybe 30 seconds because i was just wondering...
2009-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	i know how to partition and install etc.
2009-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	i just dont check every image i download with an md5 checksum
2009-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	c4pt	Most of the users does not do that. In a rare situation where the installer went wrong, that may be the main cause.
2009-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	c4pt	kinja-sheep	makes sense
