2006-08-13T16:44:00.000Z	KrisWood		this is quite frustrating...
2006-08-13T16:45:00.000Z	KrisWood		I really wish there was more documentation about inetd
2006-08-13T16:45:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	sure there is
2006-08-13T16:45:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	www.tldp.org
2006-08-13T16:46:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	I mean for ubuntu, dapper seems to hate inetd
2006-08-13T16:47:00.000Z	KrisWood		ok I'll phrase it differently, does anyone know a way to get proftpd to start in dapper whenever I boot my machine without needing to type it into the command line?
2006-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	have you installed netkit-inetd ? there is not inetd by default.
2006-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	yes, i do it on my machine.
2006-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	I had it installed in breezy, and then I upgraded, are you saying the upgrade would have removed it?
2006-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	you are better off with vsftpd though
2006-08-13T16:49:00.000Z	KrisWood		bah, I really don't want to go back to vsftpd when my proftpd has been working satasfactorily for so long
2006-08-13T16:49:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	not that I know of. type `sudo apt-get install netkit-inetd` and see what happens
2006-08-13T16:50:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	yup, already the newest version
2006-08-13T16:50:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	you dont need that to get proftpd to boot on startup. use update-rc.d
2006-08-13T16:50:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	so you say you are running dapper and proftpd?
2006-08-13T16:51:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	can I use update-rc.d to restart it as well without starting the standalone proftpd in teh console?
2006-08-13T16:54:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	`sudo apt-get install bum`
2006-08-13T05:00:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	this is what helped me to get no-ip dynamic dns software to start on its own. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto
2006-08-13T05:01:00.000Z	KrisWood	linux_user400354	I actually ended up doing something very similar just now for my proftpd, that's why I'd stopped talking heh
2006-08-13T05:01:00.000Z	KrisWood		I'm just about to try out my little init.d script now :)
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	KrisWood		omg rofl
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	KrisWood		there was already a proftpd script in intit.d
2006-08-13T05:03:00.000Z	KrisWood		init.d*
2006-08-13T05:05:00.000Z	linux_user400354	KrisWood	you better keep that website i gave you just incase what you are trying does not work
