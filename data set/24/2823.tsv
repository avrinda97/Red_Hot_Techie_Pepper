2009-08-21T02:05:00.000Z	crashoverride300		HOW DO I UPDATE MY KERNEL SO I WILL NOT GET VALNERADILITIES
2009-08-21T02:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	you should automatically recieve updates
2009-08-21T02:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	that's why the root account is locked by default
2009-08-21T02:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	you don't need caps
2009-08-21T02:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	the updates will almost always work with no issues
2009-08-21T02:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	nothing is absolutely safe from being cracked
2009-08-21T02:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	it's not possible to detect every single intrusion
2009-08-21T02:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	there are several log file under /var/log that may be usefuk
2009-08-21T02:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	i/var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog /var/log/messages and /var/log/dmesg are four of the main logs
2009-08-21T02:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	ubuntu always locks it by default
2009-08-21T02:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	its priviliges can be accessed using sudo, but it is set up so that only users of the admin group can use it
2009-08-21T02:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	and I think only root can change users' groups
2009-08-21T02:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	tools such as rkhunter and chkrootkit can detect rootkits, but they sometimes retuen false positives
2009-08-21T02:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	both
2009-08-21T02:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	the two should be used together.  Sometimes one will return a false positive (saying something is a rootkit when it isn't)
2009-08-21T02:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	that's why you use both
2009-08-21T02:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	it is impossible for anything to be 100% accurate
2009-08-21T02:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	carefully read the results and check things for yourself
2009-08-21T02:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	sudo apt-get update && sudp apt-get upgrade
2009-08-21T02:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	crashoverride300	replace sudp with sudo, it was a typo
