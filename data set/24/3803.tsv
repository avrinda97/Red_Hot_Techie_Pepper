2008-04-05T19:57:00.000Z	keiserr		"/dists/gutsy/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz file failed the MD5" burnt at 8x, the lowest my burner can burn at.. stil lthe same error
2008-04-05T19:58:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	what media you using to burn--brand?
2008-04-05T19:59:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	i used 1 melody DVD r, then 3 rammeda cd-r
2008-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	what are you using to burn --program?
2008-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	using disk utility found in Mac osx
2008-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	that is odd; that utility is very reliable
2008-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	md5 sum error? you are getting that?
2008-04-05T20:03:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	that means the iso is corrupted
2008-04-05T20:03:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	: i wonder if they made changes in the Packages.gz file and forgot to update the md5sum.txt file?
2008-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	can't be... coz the iso matches the md5 hash found on release.ubuntu site
2008-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	if you are getting md5 errors the iso is corrupted and needs to be redownloaded
2008-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	i calculated the md5 sum locally, it does give me the correct sum as found on the server here
2008-04-05T20:05:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	there is a corrupt file somewhere in there
2008-04-05T20:06:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	either that or the media as disk utility is not at fault
2008-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	we all do
2008-04-05T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	how about burning another linux iso and eliminate media as a source of error, like dsl or puppy linux then try booting from that
2008-04-05T20:18:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	: that would be worth a try
2008-04-05T20:19:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	once you do that then you can know if it is media or corrupted iso file
2008-04-05T20:20:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	okie, but explain to me the logic behind a matching hash, but corrupted file?
2008-04-05T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	have you tried downloading another iso to test out?
2008-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	keiserr	bazhang	with my current internet speed, i'll take me more than 1 day to fetch a new iso, and i need to develop my univ project before the end of friday.. and i am already late on schedule thanks for my self over estimation
2008-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	then dsl or puppy linux which are around 30-40 MB
2008-04-05T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	how about the minimal iso? it is only 9MB
2008-04-05T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	keiserr	then you can net install the rest as you wish
