2010-02-08T04:19:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	.. check points where, locally or overall ?
2010-02-08T04:37:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	you should also get a passkey from Stanford's website, even if your going to do Anonymous WU's
2010-02-08T04:39:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	the_real_dave: With FahMon, do I need to run F@H or does this run it and monitor it?
2010-02-08T04:43:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	FAHmon is just a clinet monitor, see Folding at Home How-Too's on Stanords site for install instructions.
2010-02-08T04:45:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	Following their guide, terminal says "curl" is not a command
2010-02-08T04:47:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	what OS build you using ?
2010-02-08T04:47:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	9.10 Gnome
2010-02-08T04:49:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	you wanting to Fold on your CPU or GPU ?
2010-02-08T04:49:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	Tried, failed. Trying Ubuntu's tutorial on installing. CPU
2010-02-08T04:52:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	I can't run it with 9.10 x64?
2010-02-08T04:53:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	What is the easiest way to install F@H (As a GUI)
2010-02-08T04:57:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	I ran that script, nothing happened
2010-02-08T05:03:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	Where would I go about doing that? I've been searching for a place to register or something. The only one I can see is for a team
2010-02-08T05:03:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	Also, it may have installed and downloaded the apps, but you still need to start it with ./foldingathome/folding start
2010-02-08T05:05:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	once you started the client, do the install service with: sudo ./installservice and the server install script with do the checkconfig for you.
2010-02-08T05:11:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	installservice is not a command
2010-02-08T05:22:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	: make sure you typing it correctly, it's: sudo ./installService   .. note the cap "S"
2010-02-08T05:28:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	it's best to run FAHmon from Windows, but you can compile it from Sources on UB.
2010-02-08T05:29:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	I want to fold as I use my computer since this is the only computer I have; but if I can only monitor in Win, I'll be stuck in Win7 forever
2010-02-08T05:29:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	Here's the Ubuntu FAHmon How-Too. I've used it, it works: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=703180

2010-02-08T05:42:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	I've installed I just don't know what to do with the monitoring part of it
2010-02-08T05:42:00.000Z	ke1ha_	Arsin	you add a client to it, and it tells you the status.
2010-02-08T05:42:00.000Z	Arsin	ke1ha_	I added one, but what is "Location"
