2011-03-09T06:55:00.000Z	Fishraper		How do I install and run a .exe windows file? With Wine?
2011-03-09T06:56:00.000Z	Fishraper		Is there a better solution than Wine?
2011-03-09T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	there is cedega and crossover office
2011-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	none are better, each have appdbs and some aps may work in one but not another
2011-03-09T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	cedega and crossover are not free
2011-03-09T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	you'll need a piece of hardware
2011-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	so you want to plug a device into a usb port and change it to an rs-232 ort (serial)?

2011-03-09T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	address text to me so it highlights, just as I am doing to you
2011-03-09T07:14:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	kay, thx
2011-03-09T07:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	:D
2011-03-09T07:18:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	How to disable the join/left room notification ;x
2011-03-09T07:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	which client?
2011-03-09T07:19:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	Empathy
2011-03-09T07:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	not sure, maybe others know. I don't use empathy
2011-03-09T07:33:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	I clicked on the .exe I downloaded from the site, and wine is telling me that it's not marked as an executable, how do I mark it?
2011-03-09T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	they need marking executable with:  chmod +x filename.exe
2011-03-09T07:45:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	jack_^ made the suggestion to type wine /path/filename.exe through the termal, and it worked fine. My question now I guess would be how come it didn't work by just simply click on the file in the folder through the GUI?
2011-03-09T07:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	the file wasn't executable, but the wine binary is
2011-03-09T07:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	if you make the windows binary executable it will work as expected
2011-03-09T07:46:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	So if I want to install a .exe, I'll have to chmod +x filename.exe if I want to install it through the GUI?
2011-03-09T07:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	yes, or right click it and mark as executable. I use the cli personally but both are fine
2011-03-09T07:48:00.000Z	Fishraper	ActionParsnip	It may be my netbooks touchpad, not sure, but right clicking doesn't seem to do anything lol
2011-03-09T07:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fishraper	possibly. i'd look into that with: xev   in a terminal. see if it makes events
