2011-11-06T03:19:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	http://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/question/linux/dpkg-cheat-sheet.php should give you te right command dpkg -c <package name> lists the files of a packages, combined with dpkg -l and awk you get the list you need
2011-11-06T03:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -L take care it will be a long list
2011-11-06T03:24:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	not working dpkg-query: error: package name in specifier 'Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend' is illegal: character `=' not allowed (only letters, digits and characters `-+._')
2011-11-06T03:25:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	just tested it, maybe a typo?
2011-11-06T03:25:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	dpkg -l works?
2011-11-06T03:26:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	dr3mro: dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -L .. give error
2011-11-06T03:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	so test one by one. first check if dpkg -l lists akk the packages with info , then check dpkg -l | awk '{print $2}' if that shows you only the package name
2011-11-06T03:28:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	the error is due to the 1st 4 lines on list contains no packag names but just ++--
2011-11-06T03:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	okay the try following: dpkg -l | grep -e ^ii | -awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -L take care it will be a long list
2011-11-06T03:31:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	 small type use:  dpkg -l | grep -e ^ii | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg -L
2011-11-06T03:32:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	thnx but i fixed it by sed '1,5'd .. thnx
2011-11-06T03:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	what are you trying to do? check if you system is compromised?
2011-11-06T03:33:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	yes .. i used debsums to check my files but i need to get list of files outside apt :)
2011-11-06T03:34:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	then lets hope you find nothing compromised
2011-11-06T03:35:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	thnx
2011-11-06T03:57:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	ask and I'll try to help
2011-11-06T03:57:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	would you go private ?
2011-11-06T03:58:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	if you want
2011-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	and tripwire is another tool
2011-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	cool didnt know that
2011-11-06T04:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	but only checking the installed files won't help yo much. What about al those files that are suposed to change?
2011-11-06T04:01:00.000Z	dr3mro	schnuffle	reisio iceroot .. i use now debsums , md5sum , sed , awk to do that i'll try aide and see
2011-11-06T04:01:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	and checking a compromised system should be done with a clean system
2011-11-06T04:02:00.000Z	schnuffle	dr3mro	check bekks suggestion. a good point
