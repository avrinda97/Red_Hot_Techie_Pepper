2008-11-21T03:13:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	i've got a weird drive mounting thing, a subdir on /storage/storage2 is mounting a directory on /dev/sda1 and i can't figure out how
2008-11-21T03:14:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2008-11-21T03:14:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	(/dev/sdc is mounted on /storage/storage2
2008-11-21T03:14:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	pastebinit /etc/fstab
2008-11-21T03:15:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
2008-11-21T03:15:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	sudo mount -a
2008-11-21T03:15:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	mount | pastebinit
2008-11-21T03:15:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	3 urls ?
2008-11-21T03:17:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	http://pastebin.com/f4c53aa1f http://pastebin.com/f4604ea7c
2008-11-21T03:18:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	http://pastebin.com/f50cca0ef
2008-11-21T03:22:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	can't see sth wrong there, what subdir mounts were ?
2008-11-21T03:23:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	what do you mean
2008-11-21T03:23:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	I don't get your prob, looks all normal
2008-11-21T03:24:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	so in /storage/storage2 there is a directory called backup..
2008-11-21T03:26:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	so they seem to be on sdc, too- subdirs of third hd
2008-11-21T03:27:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	if you mount a hd to a directory, you'll find it's subfolders in the mount-dir
2008-11-21T03:27:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	naw i figured it out, i've got multiple dirs named backup and i thought it was mounting sda1's dir when i was looking at the samba shares but i was looking at a different backup from sda1 which is why the disk space was wrong
2008-11-21T03:27:00.000Z	DasEi	gradin	so clear now ?
2008-11-21T03:28:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	yeps
2008-11-21T03:28:00.000Z	gradin	DasEi	tnx
