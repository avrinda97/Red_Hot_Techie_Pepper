2006-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		ok.. think it'll be better if i repartition the SATA drive? right now it has a 10gig xp partition
2006-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		gotcha
2006-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		xp is already installed
2006-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		yes draken
2006-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		i have the dvd, i was playing around with it a few weeks ago
2006-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		so i just boot off it... ill make a fat32 partition just in case on the primary sata drive
2006-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		now another question
2006-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		what's this nonsense about ubuntu not having any development tools (heard it from a friend who runs debian)
2006-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		he says i wont be able to download/compile proggies, other than executables
2006-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	ShadowWRK		nonsense?
2006-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	totally nonsense
2006-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	it's just not installed by default, but of course it's avaialable
2006-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	apt-get install build-essential
2006-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	that install the basic required packages for development
2006-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	exactly ;)
2006-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	look at the devs's profiles around on ubuntu. most of them are die-hard debian devs.
2006-01-03T06:42:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	so far, ubuntu is causing improvement of the Debian system
2006-01-03T06:46:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	yes
2006-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	they had to change their names, after being sued by MS
2006-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	ShadowWRK	raphink	- i know, i remember when they changed their name
2006-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	a big part of our work in universe is to merge Debian packages in Ubuntu and help merge Ubuntu packages in Debian.
2006-01-03T06:48:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	we want to improve the whole thing, while keeping as cloes to Debian as possible.
2006-01-03T06:49:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	gnome for ubuntu, kde for kubuntu, xfce for xubuntu
2006-01-03T06:50:00.000Z	raphink	ShadowWRK	anyway, ubuntu, kubuntu and xubuntu are not different system, they only diff by a few packages and can be turned to one another.
