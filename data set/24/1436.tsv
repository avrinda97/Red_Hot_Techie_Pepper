2010-08-04T17:09:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	i know, I told you it was /etc/defaul/grub
2010-08-04T16:59:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	try i8024.reset and/or i8024.nomux=1  as boot options
2010-08-04T16:59:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	oki thx
2010-08-04T17:00:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	ehm, where is grub.conf in ubuntu?
2010-08-04T17:02:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	you add them in /etc/default.grub    grub.conf doesn't exist. grub is generated using script files in grub2
2010-08-04T17:02:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	you will need to run: sudo update-grub   to apply the changes you make
2010-08-04T17:02:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	oki.
2010-08-04T17:09:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	i8024.* are never added in /boot/grub/grub.cfg after i run update-grub
2010-08-04T17:14:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	it just says 1: i8024.reset: not found when i run update-grub .. :(
2010-08-04T17:16:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	did you put the boot options in the quotes in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"   line??
2010-08-04T17:17:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	ehm no and now i guess i have written over the orginal file that had that line.
2010-08-04T17:18:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	can you upload a default/grub somewhere?
2010-08-04T17:19:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2   click on the /etc/default/grub   to show the default file
2010-08-04T17:20:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	ok thanks
2010-08-04T17:33:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	very sad but it didnt work. Got any more ideas?

2010-08-04T17:43:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	i guess I'll have to use an external usb mouse...
2010-08-04T17:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	just hunt round for more guides, just because 1 person doesn't know the answer doesn't mean all is lost
2010-08-04T17:43:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	yep..
2010-08-04T17:44:00.000Z	actionParsnip	iocc	jeez, if you look for the make and model of the lappy you may find guides with the boot options you need or there may be a bug logged for the model you have
2010-08-04T17:46:00.000Z	iocc	actionParsnip	yes...
