2008-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	stickboy		i'm trying to install 32bit ff on my ubuntu 8.04 64bit (intel) install. i found a thread on the forums that does it for amd, would that also work for me? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
2008-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	why do you want to install 32bit firefox?
2008-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: i can't get a java applet to work but my friend running 32bit ubuntu can.
2008-09-20T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	use those instructions.  Did you try using icedtea java plugin first though?
2008-09-20T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	gcjwebplugin is an open one that is available on amd64
2008-10-11T02:41:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/56112/ all it says, never opens anything
2008-10-11T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	is this a dvd with css (some commercial movie)?
2008-10-11T02:36:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	not really.  If other DVDs work, and this one works in XP all I can suggest is googling the error.  Can you pastebin the full output you are getting?
2008-10-11T02:38:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: i googled it and it seems all the problems are solved by using vlc but that won't work for me. how do i play the dvd using terminal?
2008-10-11T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	mplayer dvd://  if you have mplayer
2008-10-11T02:42:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	what command did you run?
2008-10-11T02:43:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: this is weird. my keyboard is literally typing on its own and random windows are opening up. haunted? lol
2008-10-11T02:44:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: mplayer dvd://media/cdrom0
2008-10-11T02:44:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	nah, just 'mplayer dvd://'
2008-10-11T02:45:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: same output as before
2008-10-11T02:45:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	it shouldn't be the same, pastebin
2008-10-11T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	hmm, do you get a window if you specify a particular title.  Like with: mplayer dvd://1    (2,3,... etc)
2008-10-11T02:48:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/56118/
2008-10-11T02:49:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: no i don't
2008-10-11T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	yeah, your last pastebin tells us the real problem.  I don't know about it.  You have to scour for info on why dvdcss fails to crack some keys
2008-10-11T02:52:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	: sudo: /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh: command not found
2008-10-11T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	you said you had dvdcss already, so you don't need to run that
2008-10-11T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	stickboy	apt-cache policy libdvdcss2     confirms it is installed right?
2008-10-11T02:54:00.000Z	stickboy	jrib	:   Installed: 1.2.9-2medibuntu4
