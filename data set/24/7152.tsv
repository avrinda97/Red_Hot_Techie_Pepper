2005-05-20T13:27:00.000Z	g14		[Chameleon] , ouch
2005-05-20T13:29:00.000Z	g14		I still bluecurve-ify the icons because human is an ugly theme
2005-05-20T13:29:00.000Z	g14		But ubuntu is a better distro
2005-05-20T13:29:00.000Z	g14		BSD init scares me
2005-05-20T13:30:00.000Z	g14		SysVInit is so much better
2005-05-20T13:31:00.000Z	g14		little stuff like a pretty xscreensaver lock dialog really matter to newbie computer users (Like the machine I set up for my parents)
2005-05-20T13:31:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	ubuntu has udev too...
2005-05-20T13:34:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	not trying to start a flamewar. What makes fedora "crappy"
2005-05-20T13:35:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	well, this might be due to sysadmins at my work, but it was a complete mess when i tried it
2005-05-20T13:35:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	it was probably the admins at work. Serverside, I think redhat is better than debian, much more so
2005-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	Well you have ubuntu, kubuntu, xbuntu, etc, etc. fedora has that on the same install set
2005-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	personally, I think debian is crap. Ubuntu is the first usable debian distro in my opinion
2005-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	my opinion too actually :)
2005-05-20T13:39:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	incompatible as in what?
2005-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	incompatible as in binary incompatibility
2005-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	yes but it also is good for speed and security
2005-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	not really...
2005-05-20T13:42:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	We will talk later
2005-05-20T14:02:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	the latest kde is quite nice though (I still don't like it, but plastik is an improvement)
2005-05-23T11:18:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	:)
2005-05-28T10:16:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	Beat me to it :)
2005-05-28T10:16:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	<alt><f7> to go back...
2005-05-29T11:15:00.000Z	g14	Seveas	Alright, so I guess I'm stuck with mutt
2005-05-29T11:16:00.000Z	Seveas	g14	nono, you're blessed with mutt :)
