2007-10-28T18:51:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	does something not look like gutsy there?
2007-10-28T18:51:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	hardware information?
2007-10-28T18:52:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	its an dell pc,  Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.40GHz
2007-10-28T18:53:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	oh.. i mean what is displaying the wrong memory size?
2007-10-28T18:53:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	it can be seen in top and free
2007-10-28T18:53:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	hmm, im not sure then
2007-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	im researching
2007-10-28T18:56:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	thanks. I'm holding the line ;)
2007-10-28T18:58:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	what does this say: cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal
2007-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	MemTotal:      3613448 kB
2007-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	and you are sure you have 4GB?
2007-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	is your video card reserving any?
2007-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	at least i paid for 4gb and the bios says so too
2007-10-28T19:00:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	if it is integrated video it is probably reserving some memory
2007-10-28T19:00:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	that could be possible, but bois says something about 4-8mb shard ram
2007-10-28T19:00:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	hmm, so it shouldnt be taking that much
2007-10-28T19:01:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	and i'm not using the internal shard memory graphic card
2007-10-28T19:03:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	im not sure what else to try
2007-10-28T19:04:00.000Z	jgf	telexicon	ok thanks anyway. Could an [Radeon X600 (PCIE)] be using shared ram?
2007-10-28T19:04:00.000Z	telexicon	jgf	im pretty sure those have their own dedicated video ram
