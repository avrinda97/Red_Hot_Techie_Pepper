2005-01-15T10:45:00.000Z	postbox		any ideas folks?
2005-01-15T10:45:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	xorg or xfree?
2005-01-15T10:45:00.000Z	postbox		xfree, it's a new warty install
2005-01-15T10:46:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	you could try to get the new ati drivers fromm the site, x600 support was only added 30september
2005-01-15T10:46:00.000Z	postbox		ah right. from the ati site?
2005-01-15T10:47:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	not sure if it will solve it, but it's a good bet: http://www.ati.com/support/drivers/linux/radeon-linux.html?type=linux&prodType=graphic&prod=productsLINUXdriver&submit.x=13&submit.y=12&submit=GO%21
2005-01-15T10:47:00.000Z	stvn		ew, evil url
2005-01-15T10:48:00.000Z	postbox	stvn	i'll give it a go. if i get no joy with this, can i get xorg from hoary without having to upgrade anything else? i.e gnome
2005-01-15T10:49:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	xorg support from ati is even worse
2005-01-15T10:49:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	no hardware 3D accel on xorg for anything above radeon 9200
2005-01-15T10:49:00.000Z	postbox		i'm not too bothered about 3d support. i just need usable resolution atm
2005-01-15T10:50:00.000Z	postbox		i wish i'd bought a laptop with an nvidia though.
2005-01-15T11:29:00.000Z	postbox		urgh. still no luck getting xfree to work. :(
2005-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	postbox		i've installed the latest driver from Ati, but when i start X, i just get a black screen(though i can hear the gdm drum sound play)
2005-01-15T11:30:00.000Z	postbox		anybody heard of that problem?
2005-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	you have a laptop, right?
2005-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	postbox	stvn	i do, yeah
2005-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	i had a problem that it showed a black screen when there was an external monitor attached
2005-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	postbox	stvn	right. i dont have that, and i selected no to tv out
2005-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	postbox	stvn	i'm gonna try selecting yes to using internal agp. maybe that'll do something
2005-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	have a look at the xserver log, see if it gives a clue
2005-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	stvn		ah yes, very possible
2005-01-15T11:41:00.000Z	stvn	postbox	i'll be off for the next hour, but will read backlog
2005-01-15T11:41:00.000Z	postbox	stvn	ok cool. thanks for the help
