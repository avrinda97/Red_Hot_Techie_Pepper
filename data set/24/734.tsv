2011-05-22T22:58:00.000Z	middle		HELP: I am running a Ubuntu on a live USB stick at the moment, and i have chrooted into my damaged ubuntu system. Now i need to apt-get install a package to (In theory) repair the damaged system. However when i use apt-get to try and install somethign i always get this error: 'Something wicked happend resolving *Various repositories* (-5 - No address associated with hostname)
2011-05-22T22:59:00.000Z	edbian	middle	what version are you running on this usb stick?
2011-05-22T22:59:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Is that the same as the installed system?
2011-05-22T22:59:00.000Z	edbian	middle	The one you're trying to fix?
2011-05-22T23:00:00.000Z	middle	edbian	Yeah, they are both on 10.10, i tried updating the repos but that just got a load more errors from each repo/mirror
2011-05-22T23:01:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Are you online on the live usb?  What did your chroot command look like?
2011-05-22T23:06:00.000Z	middle	edbian	Yeah i am connected to the net and browsing the web fine. And the chroot is like...: chroot "$middle" /usr/bin/env -i \ HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \ PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin \ /bin/bash --login
2011-05-22T23:07:00.000Z	middle	edbian	Not all on one line thoguh XD
2011-05-22T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Pretty sure you can just mount the broken install's partition, and chroot that.
2011-05-22T23:08:00.000Z	middle	edbian	ah apt-get does work on the live stick but not on the chrooted part
2011-05-22T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	middle	mount /dev/sda1 /mnt    and then    chroot /mnt
2011-05-22T23:08:00.000Z	edbian	middle	yeah, have you tried recovery mode?  It's probably much easier than this
2011-05-22T23:10:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Just log in CLI and update / install your packages that way.  sudo apt-get install <packageName>
2011-05-22T23:10:00.000Z	middle	edbian	I just tried chrooting normally and i got the same issue
2011-05-22T23:10:00.000Z	edbian	middle	I suggest doing it CLI and avoid the whole chroot thing
2011-05-22T23:10:00.000Z	middle	edbian	I mean NO graphical output lol
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Oh, like, blank screen?
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	middle	edbian	It literally boots clicks and then just black screen even in recovery mode
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	middle	nomodeset  ;)
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	middle	edbian	tried that as well, i am an ATI customer XD
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	middle	mmmm,  alright then chroot it is
2011-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	edbian	middle	Can you ping the repo servers listed in /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-05-22T23:13:00.000Z	middle	edbian	'ping: unknown host security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
2011-05-22T23:14:00.000Z	middle	edbian	So the chrooted shell is not connected to the internet
