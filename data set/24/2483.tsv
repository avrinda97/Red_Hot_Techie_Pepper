2008-12-01T21:59:00.000Z	akahige2		can any gurus on X out there tell me if a bad Xconfig could cripple performance...?
2008-12-01T22:00:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	of course, since it affects the display driver that will used by X
2008-12-01T22:02:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	my problem is that after upgrading from Hardy to Intrepid, Xorg uses a huge amount of cpu and grinds my desktop to a halt (and eventually crashes everything). I didn't have this problem before, and I need to get it fixed
2008-12-01T22:03:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	you should try to isolate the locate the problem first..
2008-12-01T22:05:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	what do you suggest?  from my observation, the problem is doing anything on an idle desktop... dragging this chat window around in circles pushes Xorg's cpu use over 50%... which obviously isn't right
2008-12-01T22:13:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	anything suggestions on how to troubleshoot my Xorg issue?
2008-12-01T22:16:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	ok I don't have many ideas, you may want to check whether you are getting the right display driver? try glxinfo|grep render
2008-12-01T22:19:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	command says "direct rendering: yes" and correctly identifies my nvidia card (which is the same as in the  nvidia x server settings app
2008-12-01T22:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	can you describe your problem more specifically? After you starting X, does it consume CPU w/o you doing anything?
2008-12-01T22:20:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	and you could run top to see what's actually eating your cpu
2008-12-01T22:23:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	I'm getting all my figures from top.  specifically, on an idle desktop, i.e. nothing video intensive going on, Xorg runs around 2-5% cpu usage. but if anything is happening that requires writing to the desktop, Xorg use shoots through the roof >60%.  this can be conky running, or dragging a window around in circles
2008-12-01T22:24:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	what desktop environment are you running, KDE or GNOME?
2008-12-01T22:25:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	Gnome. on Intrepid upgraded from Hardy (where I didn't have this problem)
2008-12-01T22:27:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	I'd recommend you to boot with the Intrepid LiveCD, and see if the problem still persists
2008-12-01T22:28:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	I can try that.  If it doesn't exist, what would that point to as being the problem?
2008-12-01T22:29:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	then it means it's not the compatibility issue between Intrepid and your hardware/drivers
2008-12-01T22:30:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	however it's not easy to tell where the problem lies :(
2008-12-01T22:30:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	meaning it could be a bug in Xorg itself and not the selection of driver?
2008-12-01T22:31:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	nope, if your system is ok with the LiveCD, then we could eliminate the possibility of bugs, driver and compatibility issues
2008-12-01T22:32:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	i.e. it must be the problem of some configuration or package of yours
2008-12-01T22:32:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	in the worst scenario, the problem could always be fixed by a reinstallation, although it's not recommended
2008-12-01T22:33:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	I'm going to try booting into the Live CD... okay if I ping you back when I get there...?
2008-12-01T22:33:00.000Z	Rainarrow	akahige2	of course if I'm still here :p
2008-12-01T22:33:00.000Z	akahige2	Rainarrow	thanks!
