2005-03-03T08:29:00.000Z	bigern75		is there a way for ubuntu to ignore other filesystems on other hd's
2005-03-03T08:29:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	edit /etc/fstab
2005-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	be more specific
2005-03-03T08:30:00.000Z	bigern75	pestilence	booting kernel 2.6.8.1-3-386
2005-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	perhaps that is a problem with your installation of grub
2005-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	you have to edit what?
2005-03-03T08:35:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	definitely sounds like a problem with grub
2005-03-03T08:35:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	look for menu.lst for grub
2005-03-03T08:41:00.000Z	bigern75	pestilence	  what should i be lookin for
2005-03-03T08:42:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	well, if you think root (hd1,0) is the problem
2005-03-03T08:46:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	you have to use sudo to edit it
2005-03-03T08:47:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	how are you editing it currently
2005-03-03T08:49:00.000Z	bigern75	pestilence	  i aint used them b4
2005-03-03T08:51:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	basically, you need superuser priveledges to edit that file.  i'm not sure how exactly this is handled through graphical editors.  i can tell you that if you go to a command prompt and type "sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst" you will get an editor which can edit that file :)
2005-03-03T08:52:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	perhaps "sudo gedit ..." would be easier.  i don't know
2005-03-03T09:00:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	i'm not sure
2005-03-03T09:01:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	paste the results of "df" in #flood
2005-03-03T09:09:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	you are probably right.  i think it needs to say "root (hd4,0)".  try that
2005-03-03T09:09:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	wait.
2005-03-03T09:10:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	ok, i think that's right :)
2005-03-03T09:24:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	shoot
2005-03-03T09:27:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	ok, so edit the menu.lst file and uncomment out the lines you commented out
2005-03-03T09:27:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	did you see my suggestion about changing that line to "root (hd4,0)"
2005-03-03T09:36:00.000Z	pestilence	bigern75	something happened.
