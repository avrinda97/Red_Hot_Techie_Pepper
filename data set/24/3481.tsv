2008-03-20T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	howdy
2008-03-20T18:00:00.000Z	screenname92834		folks I have mounted a network drive with cifs
2008-03-20T18:01:00.000Z	screenname92834		and then it refuses to let me enter the directory (fnar fnar)
2008-03-20T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	do you have access rights on the folder?
2008-03-20T18:03:00.000Z	screenname92834		sudo mount -t cifs //networkcomputer/dir /mnt -o username=user,workgroup=wkgp,dir_mode=0766
2008-03-20T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	does that username have access to the share?
2008-03-20T18:03:00.000Z	screenname92834		how would I discover that? with ls
2008-03-20T18:04:00.000Z	screenname92834		i want to cd to the mounted dir
2008-03-20T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	right click the folder -> properties -> security
2008-03-20T18:05:00.000Z	screenname92834	ActionParsnip	I'm not using gnome
2008-03-20T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 is the share on a windows box
2008-03-20T18:06:00.000Z	screenname92834		I think so
2008-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 then you need to get on there and check the file permissions as I stated
2008-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	screenname92834		ok then
2008-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 or if you enabled remote logon you can do it with rdesktop :)
2008-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	screenname92834		but if the security refuses to allow people to connect to it, then why is the mount successful?
2008-03-20T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 you can mount anything. doesnt mean you can access it
2008-03-20T18:08:00.000Z	screenname92834		I can mount it successfully with smb protocol
2008-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	check permissions on the local pc for write / read access for the username you are mounting as
2008-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	screenname92834	ActionParsnip	I can mount it successfully with the smb protocol
2008-03-20T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 you could mount your windows directory, doesnt mean you have access rights
2008-03-20T18:10:00.000Z	screenname92834		When I say successfully I mean that I can move files around
2008-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	screenname92834	 so where's the issue
