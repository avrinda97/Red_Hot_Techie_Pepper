2009-04-22T09:33:00.000Z	Skapare		I'm gonna go switch back to 32-bit and see what happens ... see if the network will work or not ... maybe something else I accidentally did a few days ago is what fixed it, instead of what people here told me to do
2009-04-22T09:34:00.000Z	Skapare		I know the driver works because it can see my networks SSID as well as 3 neighbor networks ... just can't connect because of wrong key
2009-04-22T09:35:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	yes
2009-04-22T09:37:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	yes.  I know, it doesn't make grammatical sense.
2009-04-22T09:38:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	well, I never really got into the names, anyway ... and it was even more confusing with debian
2009-04-22T09:44:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	yes
2009-04-22T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	you can rsycn the RC, and then rsycn the delta info on release day
2009-04-22T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	then use rsync as I described above
2009-04-22T09:49:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	I was just asking that in +1 ... missed your earlier message
2009-04-22T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	no problem
2009-04-22T09:51:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	I guess I didn't get that message to my client, can you give the URL again?
2009-04-22T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	which URL?
2009-04-22T09:52:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	I hadn't sent one.  It was merely a suggestion.
2009-04-22T09:52:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	oh ... well I don't know where to get it ... then I guess my question stands on #ubuntu+1
2009-04-22T09:52:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	/msg ubottu rsync for general info
2009-04-22T09:54:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	that's not giving me the URL for the rsync of the ISO ... just general info on rsync (I already know that)
2009-04-22T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	as I said, yes
2009-04-22T09:55:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	rsync doesn't do much good not knowing where to get the ISO that way
2009-04-22T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	see download info above
2009-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	how about the vast majority of laptop wireless cards ... do those need "drivers" (I assume you mean the proprietary ones that have to be installed)
2009-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	tritium	Skapare	wireless can be a little more problematic, and depends greatly on the hardware you have.
2009-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	mine needed the proprietary driver in 8.10
2009-04-22T10:11:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	fortunately it was on the ISO
2009-04-22T10:11:00.000Z	Skapare	tritium	that driver plus a new network-manager from svn ... got wireless working in 32-bit ... but not in 64-bit
