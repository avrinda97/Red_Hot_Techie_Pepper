2011-08-13T04:05:00.000Z	Llynix		I have a ubuntu machine that keeps mounting read only.  running fsck recovers the journal and shows an orphaned inode but it continuously corrupts again and again.  More info here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11146069
2011-08-13T04:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 monitor dmesg output. it could be a failing hard drive.
2011-08-13T04:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 i would guess it is a hd that is failing.. they seem the weakest link these days.
2011-08-13T04:08:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	what would a line look like?  I can't see anything in there pertaining to the hard drive
2011-08-13T04:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 io error,  'remounting read only' or somthing similer.
2011-08-13T04:08:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	I also tried western digital's drive tools and it checked fine.  brand new hard drive.. was actually a replacement for a shoddy one.
2011-08-13T04:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 if you can get an idea where the bad part of the HD is at.. you could repartition and put the bad part in its own parittion then not use it.
2011-08-13T04:09:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	 any idea how I would confirm it was bad?
2011-08-13T04:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 that is weird. but not unheard of..   mostof these HD makers have tools (windows only) to do very through tests on the hds.
2011-08-13T04:09:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	western digital seemed to offer a bootable CD that went to Dos and ran a custom program.. all tests were fine
2011-08-13T04:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 ive gone through more hd;'s then i have any other pc part in the last few years.
2011-08-13T04:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 but how through were the tests?  ive  seen some testes that take several hours to run.. and some that take just a few sec.
2011-08-13T04:10:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	one took 15 mins one took around 2-3 hours
2011-08-13T04:11:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	 if you can suggest anything else..  I have a full backup of the home directory and have already rebuilt the software once... can try again..
2011-08-13T04:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 i had a seagate tool/test of a 1tb hd.. took like a week. :)
2011-08-13T04:12:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	this is only 80 gigs
2011-08-13T04:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 but then the hd started working right.. after the test beat it in to submission i guess..
2011-08-13T04:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 80gb? how old is that thing?
2011-08-13T04:13:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	I bought the smallest new brand name drive I could find
2011-08-13T04:13:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	it was an incredible waste of money..  but I wanted to get the kiddos computer fixed quickly
2011-08-13T04:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 thats a normal line i belive..  when you find the HD gettting remounted read only, check dmesg again and there should be some error messages going on.
2011-08-13T04:22:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	ke1ha did I miss anything?  I disconnected after I said it was read only now
2011-08-13T04:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Llynix	 normally i see some info/messages about mine gettting a read/write error and remounting read only.. and a block # or some other info in dmesg output.
2011-08-13T04:37:00.000Z	Llynix	dr_willis	ke1ha thank you for your help and support..  I'm trying an advanced drive fitness test from hitachi now that I found googling.  still lost as to why there are no errors except the ones about it mounting read-only...  (no write errors or anything before that..)
