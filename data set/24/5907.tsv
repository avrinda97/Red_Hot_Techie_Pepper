2006-10-24T09:55:00.000Z	bun-bun		vice-versa# that's something you need to check in your BIOS
2006-10-24T09:55:00.000Z	bun-bun		vice-versa# sounds like a boot device priority issue
2006-10-24T09:55:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	been over that extensively
2006-10-24T09:56:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	there is no way to disable SATA in the BIOS either :(
2006-10-24T09:56:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	for what it's worth, it worked fine with Windows boot loader with just the PATA disk
2006-10-24T09:57:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	no, bot XP and Ubuntu are installed on the PATA drive
2006-10-24T09:58:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	no, I think it's a grub issue to be honest, like I said Windows boot loader works fine
2006-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	will only boot from the PATA drive if there is a SATA drive installed
2006-10-24T09:59:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	but this system will not have a SATA drive
2006-10-24T10:00:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	correct
2006-10-24T10:01:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	there was no SATA drive in the system, we just tried one on a whim and low and behold up comes grub
2006-10-24T10:05:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	so any thoughts?
2006-10-24T10:07:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	yeah, only if we install a SATA drive in the syste, there will be no SATA drive in it when it's working correctly
2006-10-24T10:08:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	well it must be, as it will boot with a SATA drive in the system
2006-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	it's not booting from the SATA drive either btw
2006-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	XP, Gentoo with lilo boot loader
2006-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	just fails to find a bootable disk
2006-10-24T10:11:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	been there done that too many times now
2006-10-24T10:11:00.000Z	vice-versa	bun-bun	liveCD
