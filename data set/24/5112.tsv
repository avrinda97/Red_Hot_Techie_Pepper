2006-10-24T13:42:00.000Z	VanessaE		yep
2006-10-24T13:42:00.000Z	VanessaE		otherwise the nv driver will bitch about version mismatch or similar.
2006-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	VanessaE		and unless it's changes, gtk has a security lock that keeps it from running as root in some situations
2006-10-24T13:44:00.000Z	VanessaE		s/ges/ged/
2006-10-24T13:45:00.000Z	VanessaE		then see if your program will run, but only do that if the program absolutely must be run as root.
2006-10-24T13:46:00.000Z	VanessaE		SWAT doesn't require a webserver.
2006-10-24T13:46:00.000Z	VanessaE		just a config file for xinetd.
2006-10-24T13:46:00.000Z	VanessaE		nope :)
2006-10-24T13:47:00.000Z	VanessaE		"sh" is a symlink to dash.
2006-10-24T13:47:00.000Z	VanessaE		and dash breaks some programs. Bash is still present though
2006-10-24T13:47:00.000Z	fernandocordes	VanessaE	what is the difference btw sh dash and bash?
2006-10-24T13:47:00.000Z	VanessaE		POV: ah hah
2006-10-24T13:48:00.000Z	VanessaE	fernandocordes	no clue whatsoever, except [lime|frost] wire won't run properly if sh links to dash. :)
2006-10-24T13:48:00.000Z	VanessaE		POV: that does sound like what I ran into, not that I can remember the program I was using at the time (maybe xcdroast?
2006-10-24T13:48:00.000Z	VanessaE		)
2006-10-24T13:49:00.000Z	VanessaE		hm
2006-10-24T13:49:00.000Z	VanessaE		Json: maybe in your system tray?
2006-10-24T13:50:00.000Z	VanessaE		sometimes programs will hide a window when you "close" it (like gaim does with the buddy list, and xmms with it's playlist and EQ)
2006-10-24T13:50:00.000Z	VanessaE		I don't know kmess at all, but try browsing the menus, see if there's an option  to show the window.
2006-10-24T13:51:00.000Z	VanessaE		your system tray should be in your panel, no?
2006-10-24T13:51:00.000Z	VanessaE		(it is on mine, but then again I use KDE)
2006-10-24T13:51:00.000Z	VanessaE		usually on the far right, mimicking windows
2006-10-24T13:52:00.000Z	fernandocordes	VanessaE	limewire?
2006-10-24T13:52:00.000Z	VanessaE	fernandocordes	yep.  had an issue with that on my hubby's edgy box.
