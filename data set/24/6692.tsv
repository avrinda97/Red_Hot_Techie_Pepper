2005-09-05T11:19:00.000Z	Bags		Having trouble with VNC  - How does one go about changing the package used by Ubuntu to server VNC?
2005-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 Huh? care to rephrase that.
2005-09-05T11:24:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Sorry about that...
2005-09-05T11:26:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Ok. I'm running Kubuntu on a dual PIII with the smp packages and VNC is running with the kfrb package serving up the remote desktop to a PC running VNC Viewer. As soon as you log in via the PC, the screen of the Kubuntu session appears for a fraction of a second, and then the view crashes with a number of different errors.
2005-09-05T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 you are 'shareing' your existing, running desktop eh?
2005-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Different errors each time. I've tried checking bugs.kde.org and reinstalling the packages.
2005-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Yes, that's right.
2005-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 may want to not do it that way. :P use tightvnc, or the other vnc server (vnc4server) and have it spawn its own 'desktop/session' of kde.
2005-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 I have never messed with kfrb myself.
2005-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 just those 2 other vnc server setups.
2005-09-05T11:29:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	How do I switch to using tightvnc? I've installed it for this very reason, but I don't really know how to make this the default VNC service...
2005-09-05T11:29:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Do I simply remove the other ones?
2005-09-05T11:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	  i always just manually run the vncserver.  never used one as a 'default vnc service'
2005-09-05T11:32:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Is there a way to force this service to run on start-up?
2005-09-05T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 thers always a way. ive seen many articals on getting vnc to do all sorts of nice fancy tricks. depends on exactlu what you want to do with it.,
2005-09-05T11:33:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Ok, I'll burrow around and see what I can find... Many thanks!
2005-09-05T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 often i have to read the 'startvnc' scripts to see exactly what stuff they are doing/defaulting to.
2005-09-05T11:34:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Where would I find them?
2005-09-05T11:35:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	Nope.. locate startvnc came up with nada...
2005-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 may be 'vncserver' :P this is whn it pays to actually read the vnc docs and check out the homepages. :P
2005-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 often i find however that disrtos have 'differnt' setups on their vncserver settings/methods.  some disrtos are vastly different in some ways. :()
2005-09-05T12:09:00.000Z	Bags	Dr_Willis	I don't know... I've installed tightvnc but it only shows an X desktop, but I need the KDE one...
2005-09-05T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 check th3 tightvnc docs and the server script that runs it - you can make a config file that lets you run any window manager.
2005-09-05T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Bags	 the file is often .vnc/xstartup  - but i am not sure what the tightbvnc package for ubuntu defaults to. (check the vncserver script to see wht it looks for)
