2011-05-10T18:18:00.000Z	ayrton_		hello in ubuntu 11.04, i can find and connect to a wireless internet but after 5 minutes of surfing the web, the internet just stops working, its not the hotspot cause other laptops keep working, any ideas?
2011-05-10T18:18:00.000Z	ayrton_		it doesnt disconnects
2011-05-10T18:19:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	What wifi card do you have?
2011-05-10T18:20:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	lspci |grep ireless
2011-05-10T18:20:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	lspci |grep ireless | pastebinit   #Or just put it here.
2011-05-10T18:22:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	When you look at the network manager, (when it has disconnected), what does it say?  Does it say that the network has been dissabled?
2011-05-10T18:23:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	lspci | pastebinit  #And send resulting URL here. Or just put the output of  lspci |grep ireless   here.
2011-05-10T18:26:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	I see conversation about that chip but not solution: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1619428
2011-05-10T18:27:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	You might try running wicd
2011-05-10T18:27:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	sudo apt-get install wicd ; sudo apt-get remove network-manager   #And then log out and back in again.
2011-05-10T18:32:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	ok im trying it
2011-05-10T18:38:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	ok i did and it finds the internet but doesnt connect
2011-05-10T18:42:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	Did you switch to wicd?
2011-05-10T18:43:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	Did you click on the wicd icon and view available wifi networks?
2011-05-10T18:44:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	^
2011-05-10T18:48:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	It trys to connect but fails?  If so, what error does it   give?
2011-05-10T18:52:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	it just doesnt connect, finds the internet just doesnt log on, and it doesnt give an error
2011-05-10T18:52:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	Are you talking about the browser not loggin in?  ?
2011-05-10T18:53:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	Or are you saying that the wireless interface does not associate with the access point?
2011-05-10T18:53:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	Is "linksys" the essid of the access point that you are wanting to connect to?
2011-05-10T18:55:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	It is probably some probem with the wifi interface.  See: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1619428
2011-05-10T18:55:00.000Z	usr13	ayrton_	What version of Ubuntu do you have installed?
2011-05-10T18:59:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	that wasnt any help
2011-05-10T19:14:00.000Z	ayrton_	usr13	i switched back to network-manager and i connect and have internet, but it drops after 5 minutes
