2005-07-08T16:41:00.000Z	gm78		As far as I can tell all my fans seem to be running, and the temps are never going above 46 degrees, they normally stay around 42, but it says that fan isnt spinning. i have my computer open and i cant see a fan not spinning

2005-07-08T09:27:00.000Z	gm78		Does anyone here use Limewire?
2005-07-08T09:29:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	i have limewire pro
2005-07-08T09:29:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	what does limewire not understand about disconnect? :-P i specifically clicked disconnect last night but left the program running, wake up this morning, and its uploaded 4 GBs and now my ISP is going to charge me for it
2005-07-08T09:30:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	: had it set to max 10 KB/s, so how it uploaded 4 GBs while it was supposed to be disconnected baffles me
2005-07-08T09:31:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	ur better of just disableing the sharing option in limewire, that way you wont get sued
2005-07-08T09:32:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	why does it matter tho? if i click disconnect it should disconnect, no uploads or downloads, thats how kazaa, bearshare, and well...every other p2p program works. im using the beta, do u think it might be a bug? I tried reporting it, but their bugzilla is down
2005-07-08T09:32:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	never use beta software
2005-07-08T09:33:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	i could give you my copy of limewire
2005-07-08T09:35:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	what do u mean? do u mean give me ur license for pro? dont they track that kind of stuff?
2005-07-08T09:36:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	whats the difference between limewire basic and pro?
2005-07-08T09:40:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	no, that cant be true. i was downloading something last night at 80 kb/s....its rare, but i do get downloads that fast sometimes
2005-07-08T09:40:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	im only saying what iv heard and what iv read on there site
2005-07-08T09:42:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	oh, lol, i didnt know u could do that. ive been doing it the long way then
2005-07-08T09:43:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	u still have to do that with the Official nvidia drivers but for the Ubuntu ones its sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-07-08T09:44:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	oh, lol, ive just been isntalling the ubuntu ones and then editing the x config file
2005-07-08T09:44:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	oh well, worked anyways :P
2005-07-08T09:45:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	u mean ur tv out? isnt there supposed to be like nvtv or some program like that to do it for u?
2005-07-08T09:47:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	according to synaptic's description of nvtv it works with both the official 3d drivers and the open source nv drivers
2005-07-08T09:47:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	which nvidia card do u have?
2005-07-08T09:47:00.000Z	kenny	gm78	i have a Geforce FX 5600
2005-07-08T09:48:00.000Z	gm78	kenny	i have a geforce fx 5200. I was actually thinking of trying to get tv-out working (never even touched it before). if ig et it working ill let u know if ur on here
