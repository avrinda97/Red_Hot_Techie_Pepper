2007-07-11T16:54:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I want to run a SMART self test on my notebook's hd. But  smartctl said "device doesn't support SMART". Is this caused by the drive or the kernel (2.6.20 from 7.0.4)?
2007-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I installed 7.04 on my notebook. After ~2 minutes of inactivity the creen goes black. Wheere can I set this value and how can I force it to "dpms off"?

2007-07-11T08:09:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. Do I have to restart any daemons after a change of /etc/logrotate.conf?
2007-07-11T08:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 proberly should.
2007-07-11T08:16:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	What do you mean "proberly should"?
2007-07-11T08:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 some demons dont need it.. many (most) do.
2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 ext2/3 or if shareing btween different machines - could use vfat
2008-12-29T16:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	sort of depends on what youa re doing wih the sticks.
2008-12-29T16:57:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	I just want to the stick to share data between different ubuntu machines (and users). Could there be any problems when using ext?
2008-12-29T16:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 with ext2 it WILL  keep ownership and permissions.. thus user bob may or may not be able to read/write user Bubba's files on that stick
2008-12-29T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	if just using it to transfer files  and you want everyone to read them with no hassles.. vfat prioberly is the best bet
2008-12-29T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	if it messed up you can always try other fs's later.. not likt its hard to change them
2008-12-29T17:01:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	ok, thanks. I just thought there was a (usable) OSS alternative to vfat ...
2008-12-29T17:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	ext2 and 3 are useable.. but as i said.. a Linux native FS  - WILL keep ownership/permissions - that may be a good thing.. or bad thing.. depending on your needs
2012-04-24T04:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	i belive compiz has a window-rules plugin  that can do some of that.  theres also an app called 'devilspie' i think thaat can tweak those settings
2012-10-08T01:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 you have to use some command line options to enable it i belive. im not even sureit appears in the plugins list then
2012-10-08T01:32:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	I tested on several sites. It seems to be disabled.
2012-10-08T01:33:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	None. `man google-chrome` doesnâ€™t mention flash.
2012-10-08T01:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 then thats why its not working.
2012-10-08T01:34:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	Do you know how?
2012-10-08T01:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 seen guides on it at webupd8 or omgubuntu.. i never tried it
2012-10-08T01:37:00.000Z	vlt	dr_willis	http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=108086 says it should be enabled by default.
2012-10-08T01:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	vlt	 never noticed or tried. Im back to using firefox these days
