2010-02-15T00:02:00.000Z	richard123		pingfloyd: OK, think I have got it: please check is this is correct: the main one (sda2) is the windows user space, I back up my files from this, delete this partition? Then will I have unallocated space in gparted to creat a new partition within?
2010-02-15T00:03:00.000Z	richard123		pingfloyd: why?
2010-02-15T00:04:00.000Z	richard123		pingfloyd: why sda4, what is lvm?
2010-02-15T00:05:00.000Z	richard123		pinkfloyd: what is lvm? (OK)
2010-02-15T00:06:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	logical volume management - a way to assign diskspace at will later
2010-04-17T17:30:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	in the last line the "main restricted universe multiverse" (or whatever you like) is missing
2010-04-17T17:31:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	- I cant get back in to change it?
2010-04-17T17:32:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list   should get you an editing session
2010-04-17T17:35:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	you are a whiz - that worked. Now, what I was trying to do originally was install: scribus-1.3.6.tar.bz2 that I have extracted and got lots of files but dont know what to do with them - can you help further?
2010-04-17T17:37:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	why are you trying to install that from source? it is in the repos
2010-04-17T17:38:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	sorry I dont follow.
2010-04-17T17:39:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	this is a newer version than I have installed.
2010-04-17T17:39:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	in ubuntu you usually install software with the proper management tools
2010-04-17T17:39:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	do you mean Package Manager?
2010-04-17T17:40:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	as this version is not listed in it.
2010-04-17T17:40:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	I mean synaptic or software center or apt-get or aptitude
2010-04-17T17:41:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	software centre does not list this version, neither does package manager: what would be the command in a terminal if I have downloaded and extracted to a folder on the desktop?
2010-04-17T17:42:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	why do you need this version?
2010-04-17T17:43:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	someone in scribus channel recommeded I update because the bug I wanted to report is probably covered by the 150 bugs fixed in this release.
2010-04-17T17:46:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	I see - please type "/msg ubottu compile" here in the channel (without the quotes) - that should give you something to read :-)
2010-04-17T17:48:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	you have referred me to:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware  is that what you mean?
2010-04-17T17:49:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	yes - if you are going to compile software yourself you will have to know what you are doing :)
2010-04-17T17:50:00.000Z	richard123	guntbert	OK, thank you for your help :-)
2010-04-17T17:51:00.000Z	guntbert	richard123	I know it was no real help :-)
