2010-07-03T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	wired or wireless network cards?
2010-07-03T10:05:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	Roasted, one second, testing some more
2010-07-03T10:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 actually its sort of quiet. :)
2010-07-03T10:17:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	do you have any thoughts on swapd vs. a swap partition?
2010-07-03T10:32:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	Roaster, It looks like they took out the atl1c driver support
2010-07-03T11:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 try mounting them by hand.
2010-07-03T11:57:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	HL-2040?
2010-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	try a different print queue?
2010-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 using the lpd/lpq feature of teh wireless printer right now. I may hook it up via wire and see if it goes any better.. but thats defeating the purpose of me buying a wireless printer. :)
2010-07-03T12:00:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	can you use IPP instead of lpd/q?
2010-07-03T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 it might be able to. the printer showed up as like 5 different 'things' in the CUPS scans.. smb, ipp, and a few others.
2010-07-03T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 right now its using --> dnssd://Brother%20HL-2170W%20series._printer._tcp.local/          whatever dnssd: is
2010-07-03T12:02:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	my brother is slightly better behaved with IPP, but similarly slow
2010-07-03T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 i will try that. So far this slowness is the ionly issue ive had with that printer
2010-07-03T12:30:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	what was the fix?
2010-07-03T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	  chaged the uri, and the driver to  the generic plc5 simplied driver. :) let me find the url i used
2010-07-03T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1461480&highlight=brother+printer+slow
2010-07-03T12:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 next to the last post on the page.. scroll WAY down. :)
2010-07-03T12:33:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	thanks... I'll give this a shot tomorrow morning, see if I kick it into gear
2010-07-03T12:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 yea. I bookmarked that url. and added a comment for my exact printer. Hope it gets fixed in the next release. Ive not seen any lost functionality from using the generic drivers.
2010-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 I helped edit that during beta. :)
2010-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	bribroder	Dr_Willis	does it explain how to firefox??
2010-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 not sure. ive not really looked at the other changes since early beta.
2010-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bribroder	 i did print it out at work and gave a few copies to people. :)
