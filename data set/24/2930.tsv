2008-06-21T16:42:00.000Z	msingh`		samba is still broken
2008-06-21T16:42:00.000Z	msingh`		wtf?
2008-06-21T16:43:00.000Z	msingh`		a) i have to run smbpasswd all the time, b) i cant reliably share new directories or change permissions
2008-06-21T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 demand a refund? or file a bug report.
2008-06-21T16:45:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	i am sure there is already one
2008-06-21T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 the issues ive been having 2ith samba are neither of those 2 issues you mention.
2008-06-21T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 you might want to check the forums, there may be some bug/workaround info.  My issue is with gnome/kde file manager and smbfuse, not seeing the windows shares/network at all.
2008-06-21T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 but odly enough if i run smb4k - it can see/mount the windows shares fine.
2008-06-21T16:46:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	i am having problems with sharing, not viewing shares
2008-06-21T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 Yep. Im having the exact opposite.    Windows can get to the linux machines fine.
2008-06-21T16:47:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	stupid hardy broken what worked perfectly in 7.10
2008-06-21T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 down with progress!
2008-06-21T16:49:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	i just want the losers who broke it to know they have broken it
2008-06-21T16:49:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	where can i find them?
2008-06-21T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 from what ive read in the forums - the issues are hard to track down.. But it seemed that using the older version of samba, fixed the problems.. but thats not a good 'fix'
2008-06-21T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 oddly enouhg - my installs of Linux Mint (ubuntu variant) do NOT seem to have the problem.
2008-06-21T16:50:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	for you? for me it's they decided to stop using the old way and switched to a new one which doesnt work. which is bloody frustrating for a user
2008-06-21T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 theres the new samba in the works also. :) wonder when it will be ready.
2008-06-21T16:52:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	im sure this is not a samba problem -- this is a ubuntu problem and specifically a 8.04 problem because i never had any problems with 7.10
2008-06-21T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 from what ive read. (go check the forums if you want) it seems tobe somthing very hard to track down.    THeres  plenty of evidence there is a problem.. just no one can seem to track down what specifically is the issue.   I posted my info/specs/stuff to the forums to help out the others.. but ive not checked on the thread lately
2008-06-21T16:54:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	the forums are no good unless someone is having the same exact problem as you and they are smart enough to leave enough clues to find that thread
2008-06-21T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 guess ya jut give up then, or sit in here and rant all day.  I found quite a few threads on the topic.  and learnd a few things.
2008-06-21T16:55:00.000Z	msingh`	Dr_willis_	there is nothing i can do about it though except complain about a broken distro because this is a very important feature for pretty much any computer user
2008-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	msingh`	 i noticed that bug also and found it confuseing also... :) thats how the kde/gnome file managers work..
