2005-03-20T15:19:00.000Z	calamari		Do I need the samba package installed in order to browse Windows shares, or just samba-common ?
2005-03-20T15:21:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	you need smbclient
2005-10-08T14:15:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	yes, you can shoot yourself in the foot like that
2005-10-08T14:15:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	cool, how?
2005-10-08T14:17:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	you can edit the sudoers file and let some users require no password. then sudo won't bother them with one
2005-10-08T14:17:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	this of course is a very silly thing to do
2005-10-08T14:17:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	man sudoers. you can do that too
2005-10-08T14:18:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	you just don't want to read a man page :)
2005-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	including the crackers and broken programs etc.
2005-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	sounds sane. although you seem to have a buggy system too
2005-10-08T14:22:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	some tv cards can support dual console and tv out, mine can't
2005-10-23T16:13:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	you can change the desktop font at system -> preferences -> fonts
2005-10-23T16:13:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	how about for non-desktop?
2005-10-23T16:14:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	all the configureable font settings are there
2005-10-23T16:14:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	so it's not possible to make my icon font larger except the desktop?
2005-10-23T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	you mean in the file manager?
2005-10-23T16:15:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	I mean I have folders and when I open them the fonts are difficult to read
2005-10-23T16:16:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	File, About tells me it's Nautilus
2005-10-23T16:16:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	looks like chaning the application font applies to those to
2005-10-23T16:17:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	thanks
2005-10-23T16:17:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	if it works, cool
2005-10-23T16:18:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	well, things mostly work.. had to ditch firefox and use mozilla because firefox seems to be broken in breezy .. no fonts
2005-10-23T16:19:00.000Z	topyli	calamari	oh yeah, you were asking for firefox help before. couldn't help with that
2005-10-23T16:19:00.000Z	calamari	topyli	np.. thanks for your font help.. I can see again :)
