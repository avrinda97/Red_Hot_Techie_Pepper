2005-03-02T12:37:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	I'm running warty. I have utf8 as my locale. You will have to convert the file named from iso8859-1 to utf8 if you want to use it. What happens if you mount hda4 with utf8?
2005-03-02T12:45:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	any positive news?? :-)
2005-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	can you open from within OO?

2005-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	I have my locale set to utf8 and have no problems.
2005-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	when I had locale set to 8859-1 I had the same prob
2005-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	hold
2005-03-02T13:00:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	dpkg-reconfigure locales and follow the instructions
2005-03-02T13:01:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	sudo first
2005-03-02T13:01:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	I don't know. I don't use windows... :-)
2005-03-02T13:02:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	you can change locale and try. Y can allways change back.
2005-03-02T13:03:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	what choices?
2005-03-02T13:04:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	don't know. What does aa stand for? Perhaps try both?
2005-03-02T13:08:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	don't forget to at least restart gnome after switching locales. Just to be on the safe side.
2005-03-02T13:11:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	I use warty. My locale is sv_SE.UTF-8. wait a minute...
2005-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	there is an entry in dkpg that is pt_BR.UTF8. Try that??
2005-03-02T13:14:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	 use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales" without the "
2005-03-02T13:22:00.000Z	JsPr	dtyge1	your welcome. Ubuntu feeling! :-)
