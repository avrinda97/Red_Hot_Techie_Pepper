2008-03-12T12:11:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	not by default, there is a way to enable it give me a minute.
2008-03-12T12:13:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	one moment i'm trying to find the thread about it
2008-03-12T12:13:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	take your time I am here
2008-03-12T12:14:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	see if this helps http://www.ducea.com/2006/06/21/ubuntu-how-to-enable-the-root-account/
2008-03-12T12:14:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	it is outdated, no idea if it works now
2008-03-12T12:15:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	i'd recommend you avoid running your desktop environment as root
2008-03-12T12:15:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	why wats the problem running directly as root
2008-03-12T12:15:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	huge security vulnurability, tell me why you need to do it anyways?
2008-03-12T12:17:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	why do you want to run your entire session as root?
2008-03-12T12:18:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	ok sudo command
2008-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	if its a graphical program use gksu instead
2008-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	sudo is if you are running a terminal program
2008-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	you shouldnt need to type your password that often, it remembers it for 15mins (or less, not sure)
2008-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	so it means that , once I use sudo command i can work for default timeout of the password
2008-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	the reason you have to use sudo/gksu to run something as root means that something can't royally bork your system (to the point it fails to boot) without you specifically giving it root. If you ran your session as root it'd be like windows where you are administrator by default (and thus why viruses propgate so easily and do so much damage)
2008-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	yes, you still need sudo before each command, but it shouldnt ask for password again if its only a short time after the last sudo use
2008-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	the same applies for gksu
2008-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	thank bro, got a good help from you. thanks for your patients
2008-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	not a problem :)
2008-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	taks	email me at jscinoz@gmail.com if you need further help.
2008-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	taks	jscinoz	yes
