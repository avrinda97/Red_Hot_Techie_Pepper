2009-11-11T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	which irc client?
2009-11-11T12:10:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	for xchat it is /join #freenode   or simply /j #freenode

2009-11-11T12:14:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	to highlight others in such a busy channel, type the first three or so letters, then hit the tab key and you complete their nickname
2009-11-11T12:15:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	thanks!
2009-11-11T12:15:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	so for me would be baz <tab> key and it would highlight me
2009-11-11T12:15:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	that rules! awesome tip.
2009-11-11T12:15:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	there is weechat and irssi if you want to use command line clients
2009-11-11T12:16:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	gnome enabled is fine... =O)
2009-11-11T12:16:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	additionally there is channel #xchat and they have quite good documentation on their site
2009-11-11T12:17:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	thanks for holding my hand. I'm going to add xchat to my fav's.
2009-11-11T12:18:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	to get autojoin on channels, click xchat network list then highlight ubuntu servers and hit edit and add the channels #channel,#channel,#etc to autojoin
2009-11-11T12:19:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	awesome
2009-11-11T12:20:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	for instance if you get a cloak via #freenode
2009-11-11T12:20:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	you've been doing this for a while. I can tell.
2009-11-11T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	not very long in truth. not much to know to be honest (just a few commands)
2009-11-11T12:21:00.000Z	moderated	bazhang	Thanks for taking the time.
2009-11-11T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	moderated	it's why we are here :)
