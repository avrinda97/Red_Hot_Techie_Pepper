2009-08-09T02:45:00.000Z	cor		ignore that. there is a rename command, isn't there?
2009-08-09T02:46:00.000Z	cor		sure, but it's not designed for renaming lots of files, whereas, I assume rename is
2009-08-09T02:46:00.000Z	cor		I could be wrong
2009-08-09T02:47:00.000Z	cor		a for blah in blah type construct seems pretty old-school
2009-08-09T02:47:00.000Z	cor		I tend to use the package manager when looking for software for a particular task, but that's just me
2009-08-09T02:48:00.000Z	cor		dude! it's not me that wants it
2009-08-09T02:48:00.000Z	cor		twigll, import function?
2009-08-09T02:49:00.000Z	cor		yekteen, check the response headers (if it's web access only) locally, many ways
2009-08-09T02:50:00.000Z	cor		you think you got problems, the other day, my "configure kate" menu item simply vanished. just as well I got a shortcut for it!
2009-08-09T02:51:00.000Z	cor		gia... yes
2009-08-09T02:52:00.000Z	giampiero	cor	how do I download packages from the internet?
2009-08-09T02:52:00.000Z	cor		twigll, in the time it took to write that, you probably could have imported them all and had a look-see
2009-08-09T02:53:00.000Z	cor	giampiero	the repository URLs lead to actual real locations, I think.
2009-08-09T02:53:00.000Z	cor		look in its ini file, in its profile folder
2009-08-09T02:54:00.000Z	cor		in ~//mozilla-thunderbird or something similar
2009-08-09T02:54:00.000Z	cor		/ = /
2009-08-09T02:54:00.000Z	cor		I really must stop coming onto IRC only when I'm dead beat!
2009-08-09T02:55:00.000Z	cor		okay twigll
2009-08-09T02:56:00.000Z	cor	giampiero	don't you have an install CD you can pull packages from?
2009-08-09T02:57:00.000Z	giampiero	cor	thank you I'll give it a try.
2009-08-09T02:58:00.000Z	giampiero	cor	I've the install CD but after installing Ubuntu the system periodically requires updates from the Internet, right?
2009-08-09T02:59:00.000Z	cor	giampiero	i see, updates. sure, you can grab those from another machine, but what a pain! can't you connect that box to the internet at all, even for a short while each week?
2009-08-09T02:59:00.000Z	cor		not useless, but limited
2009-08-09T03:00:00.000Z	giampiero	cor	the problem is that my old PC has only USB connection while I have internet LAN connection, so i should buy a MPCI card, I only wanted to try to save the money :-)
