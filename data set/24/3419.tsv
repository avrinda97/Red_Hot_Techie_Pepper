2008-02-03T01:51:00.000Z	protcront		hello
2008-02-03T01:52:00.000Z	protcront		i already have ubuntu installed on my laptop but i want to install the kubuntu 7.10 as well, is it possible
2008-02-03T01:52:00.000Z	protcront		and how ?
2008-02-03T01:52:00.000Z	MrObvious	protcront	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and let it fly.
2008-02-03T01:53:00.000Z	MrObvious	protcront	The one thing to note is KUbuntu uses KDM for the login manager, but I think GDM is better so based on my opinion I would keep that.
2008-02-03T01:54:00.000Z	protcront	MrObvious	when i run that command is it gonna install the latest version of kubuntu or the oldest
