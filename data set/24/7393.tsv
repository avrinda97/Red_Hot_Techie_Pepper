2005-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	google for wondershaper
2005-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	thanks
2005-10-29T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	packages from my repo are 1.5.0, but versioned as 1.4.0+1.5.0
2005-10-29T15:13:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	oh ok
2005-10-29T15:14:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	so does 1.4.0-44 sound right on the --status screen?
2005-10-29T15:14:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	yes
2005-10-29T15:30:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	the kanotix freenx will NOT work on breezy
2005-10-29T15:31:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	figured as much but it's interesting that i get an identical problem. perhaps there's something on my system from kanotix that is remaining when i try to install yours?
2005-10-29T15:35:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	any other ideas on what to try? :(
2005-10-29T15:36:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	not right now
2005-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	i dont know if it would matter but when i try apt-get install nxclient it gives me an error about the file not being a valid .deb package
2005-10-29T15:57:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	okay i've turned on logging in node.conf and after trying to connect with the windows nx client nothing is written to the log. it seems like the client isnt even ATTEMPTING to connect.
2005-10-29T15:58:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	right... are you sure you put in the correct IP address and that there's no firewall in the way?
2005-10-29T15:58:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	it's on my local network, going through the router. 192.168.0.12 to ssh to it... 192.168.0.12 in nxclient chokes
2005-10-30T17:00:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	now when i try to do anything with nxserver ie --status, --restart it just 'freezes' and stops responding until i press enter, and then it says "quit Quit"
2005-10-30T17:15:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	the problem seems to be in your network
2005-10-30T17:18:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	: but if i have no firewall and i can ssh to it what could block nx?
2005-10-30T17:19:00.000Z	Seveas	titanium	wait a sec: you *manually* downloaded packages right?
2005-10-30T17:19:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	the .deb files? i just added your site to my sources.list and did apt-get
2005-10-30T17:20:00.000Z	titanium	Seveas	i think im just going to reinstall breezy when i get home because this shit is insane, i'm out of ideas
