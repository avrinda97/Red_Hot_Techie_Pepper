2005-07-07T07:23:00.000Z	secata		Good point HappyFool  ;o)
2005-07-07T07:24:00.000Z	secata		NeoCicak...it's usually either a BIOS setting or a hardware setup.  I think only one of the sockets can work at one time, can be wrong.
2005-07-07T07:26:00.000Z	secata		May haps, compare the audio config file for Ubuntu and warty?
2005-07-07T07:27:00.000Z	secata		moo
2005-07-07T07:28:00.000Z	secata		lol Discipulus...I know what you mean
2005-07-07T07:28:00.000Z	secata		15 meg's is harsh for a kernel header update...on dial-up that is...
2005-07-07T07:29:00.000Z	secata		Discipulus...tip...rather use pppconfig to do your dialup than using Gnome/KDE's visual dialer
2005-07-07T07:29:00.000Z	secata		Had the same prob with my b/w until I started using pppconfig
2005-07-07T07:31:00.000Z	secata		okeanos, is the volume turned up? joke ;o)
2005-07-07T07:32:00.000Z	secata		whoops, sorry N3nt , okeanos, nick mix up :')
2005-07-07T07:33:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	what do you mean?
2005-07-07T07:36:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	after using pppconfig how do I connect?
2005-07-07T07:36:00.000Z	secata	Discipulus	you use "pon" to connect, "poff" to disconnect and "plog" to see the status
2005-07-07T07:37:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	alright
2005-07-07T07:44:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	wow, there's a major difference. Thanks for that piece of advice!
2005-07-07T07:48:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	how did you figure that out anyway?
2005-07-07T07:50:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	ah, gotcha, cool
2005-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	you're on dial-up?
2005-07-07T08:00:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	that's nothing, I downloaded 10mb at 899 b/s yesterday
2005-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	thanks for the advice though, there's a BIG difference
2005-07-07T08:01:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	like going from dial-up to broadband...except this is from broken dial-up to good dial-up
2005-07-07T08:02:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	I do warrent enough internet time to do a good upgrade to DSL, but my mom won't let me :'(
2005-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	Discipulus	secata	how much does the average job pay?
2005-07-07T08:14:00.000Z	secata	Discipulus	yep
