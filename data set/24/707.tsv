2011-03-04T15:27:00.000Z	theCman		hey I need some help with my resolution, my monitor is capable and suppose to be at 1600x900 and such, I know the nvidia card can handle it, the other monitor I had showed resolutions far beyond this
2011-03-04T15:27:00.000Z	theCman		it says its a "crt" and wont let me pick anything higher than 1024x768
2011-03-04T15:28:00.000Z	theCman		please it is butt ugly
2011-03-04T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	what video card do you have ?
2011-03-04T15:28:00.000Z	theCman	ikonia	nvidia 8400GS with 1g of GDDR3
2011-03-04T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	have you enabled the propritary nvidia drivers from the "additional drivers" tool ?
2011-03-04T15:29:00.000Z	theCman	ikonia	no I am a complete retard
2011-03-04T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	drop the smart mouth a.) I didn't see you say that b.) which drivers ?
2011-03-04T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	I'm more than capable, so answer the questions
2011-03-04T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	which drivers did you enable ?
2011-03-04T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	did it give a version number in the menu ?
2011-03-04T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	(it probably didn't I'm just checking)
2011-03-04T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	ok, so first thing first, have you rebooted ?
2011-03-04T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	why is that obvious ?
2011-03-04T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	I'm asking reasonable questions, if you can't answer without a smart mouth it's pointless progressing
2011-03-04T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	that doesn't mean you've rebooted, that means you're having ap roblem
2011-03-04T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	have you rebooted since you used the hardware drivers tool to enable the nvidia drivers ?
2011-03-04T15:32:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	so answer the questions, don't need the smart comments
2011-03-04T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	I don't think a reboot would fix it, I was just trying to get the status of your machine, to start trouble shooting it
2011-03-04T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	I didn't see the older posts,
2011-03-04T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	good luck resolving your issue, I'm out
2011-03-04T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	can you please forward me one of the requests
2011-03-04T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	just pm/cut and paste
2011-03-04T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	theCman	that's your problem to figure out now, I'll deal with your spam issue, thank you for reporting it
