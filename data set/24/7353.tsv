2006-01-18T15:34:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	sorry,
2006-01-18T15:34:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	the comment above i accidentally directed at cycom instead of you
2006-01-18T15:42:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	you can use 'dvd::rip' and others to do the same as DVDShrink.
2006-01-18T15:43:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	are you sure? dvd::rip can shrink a dual-layer dvd to single-layer dvd size, in dvd format, keeping menus/special features/etc.?
2006-01-18T15:44:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	because the last time I checked it definitely could not.
2006-01-18T15:44:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	yes...
2006-01-18T15:44:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	and there are a few others. Note it won't produce a DVD-compatible DVD though.
2006-01-18T15:44:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	you need another program for that.
2006-01-18T15:44:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	see that's exactly what i'm talking about...
2006-01-18T15:45:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	but you can use 'dvd::rip to prepare the files, then use the DVD-Video packager for the last step.
2006-01-18T15:45:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	DVD-Video packager?
2006-01-18T15:46:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	DVD-Video is in a different format from DVD-ROM... So you need a program that can build a proper DVD-Video image, not an ISO one.
2006-01-18T15:46:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	no, dvd video is just a set of files on an iso fs
2006-01-18T15:47:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	but DVD-Video actually just contains a bunch of MPEG2 files and a few other things. It is just the format of the imagfe that is different.
2006-01-18T15:47:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	so, what's this packager program? is it in the repos?
2006-01-18T15:47:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	no, DVD-Video is actually in UDF, not in ISO format, and even then it must be specially formatted UDF.
2006-01-18T15:48:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	it is in the repos and is called 'dvdauthor'. There are others.
2006-01-18T15:50:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	so....is dvdauthor just a command line tool?
2006-01-18T15:51:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	yes, but there are frontends for it because it requires a very large number of parameters (creating a properly standard DVD-Video image is not easy).
2006-01-18T15:51:00.000Z	yaaar	Blissex	know the name of a good gtk frontend?
2006-01-18T15:51:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	no.
2006-01-18T15:52:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	just did a google of "dvdauthor gui" and guess what...
2006-01-18T15:53:00.000Z	Blissex	yaaar	for example an Ubuntu thread on the subject:
