2010-03-18T00:06:00.000Z	Alan502		i just downloaded a .patch file for bitlbee, how do i apply it?
2010-03-18T00:07:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	What was the source., i.e. where did the deb or pkg come from?
2010-03-18T00:07:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	i installed bitlbee from synaptic
2010-03-18T00:08:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	Should just install correctly then
2010-03-18T00:08:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	but i downloaded the patch separately.... not from synaptic
2010-03-18T00:09:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	how should i "install" the patch?
2010-03-18T00:10:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	Ah, ok, that is why I asked what was the source, I would not. I would look for the correct .deb or pkg that works or is designed to work with the current or running kernel.
2010-03-18T00:11:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	for bitlbee? i don't think bitlbee has something to do with the kernel
2010-03-18T00:11:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	Versions matter, some stuff works on ### and some does not, yet. or never will.
2010-03-18T00:12:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	i'm looking in synaptic, but can't find the patch i downloaded
2010-03-18T00:13:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	That is where I was headed, it may not work with the version. Let me look at the deb packages.
2010-03-18T00:14:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	ok thanks
2010-03-18T00:15:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	What version Ubuntu are you using now?
2010-03-18T00:15:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	9.10
2010-03-18T00:16:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	Here is the BIG list. http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and here is 9.10: http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/ But look at the Big List because it may be a backport.
2010-03-18T00:17:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	ah, ok thanks; i'll give it a look
2010-03-18T00:17:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	You are very welcome, I am still looking for that package though.
2010-03-18T00:18:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	i don't think it's on the repositories, it's just a patch
2010-03-18T00:19:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	i can just find other plugins, but not exactly the one i am looking for
2010-03-18T00:19:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	Is it a deb?
2010-03-18T00:20:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	the ones i found where debs, yes, and they are on synaptic too. The one i downloaded is a .patch
2010-03-18T00:24:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=71031341 That is the Forum , still looking
2010-03-18T00:26:00.000Z	Alan502	Vigo	thanks, i hope i can find something about the bitlbee msn patch i'm looking for
2010-03-18T00:27:00.000Z	Vigo	Alan502	You are very welcome, I hope that Forum page helps.
