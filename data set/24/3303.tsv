2008-02-28T18:56:00.000Z	_maney		Aborted (core dumped)
2008-02-28T18:56:00.000Z	_maney		tried both "abiword" and "abiword-gtk" packages
2008-02-28T18:56:00.000Z	_maney		the latter first - it did NOT install the boatload of dependencies the former did
2008-02-28T18:57:00.000Z	_maney		but they both behave just the same
2008-02-28T18:57:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	what kind of doc is it?
2008-02-28T18:59:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	yes i see that but you could try gedit or openoffice if you need to print something quickly
2008-02-28T18:59:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	that's an option, but he XML will take a bunch of cleaning up, reformatting... and the issue HERE is that abiword ralphs
2008-02-28T19:44:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	did you reinstall abiword?
2008-02-28T19:58:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	did.  trace shows it blowing up in something to do with fonts, so I'm going to try restarting X on the chance that something didn't get updated on the fly... as soon as I have time
2008-02-28T20:04:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	can you check in your home dir for AbiwordSuite directory and inside should be preferences file
2008-02-28T20:05:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	if you check toward bottom of file should say posx= and posy=
2008-02-28T20:05:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	what are the numbers in there?
2008-02-28T20:10:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	both are "0"
2008-02-28T20:10:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	both are "0"
2008-02-28T20:11:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	should be posx='34' and posy='143' and flags='2'
2008-02-28T20:12:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	maybe thats why its just opening for a second
2008-02-28T20:12:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	just edited the prefs - no change
2008-02-28T20:12:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	ok well good luck
2008-02-28T20:13:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	deleted the .AbiSuite directory - no change
2008-02-28T20:14:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	interesting, the new profile it created has all three of those zero
2008-02-28T20:14:00.000Z	legend2440	_maney	i'm stumped. very strange
2008-02-28T20:17:00.000Z	_maney	legend2440	well, if I don't get interrupted I'm going to restart the desktop... be back soon
