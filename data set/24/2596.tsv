2010-04-28T08:55:00.000Z	patrick-1		Hey, im running dapper drake with apache2 + php5 package in mod_php mode - is it possible to update the php installation to 5.3.2 by hand?

2010-04-28T08:58:00.000Z	patrick-1		Okay, i simply want to understand how php interacts with aache when using mod_php so i can upgrade myseld

2010-04-28T08:59:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	You could, yes.  But why would you want to?  Is there something keeping you from upgrading?
2010-04-28T08:59:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	there is no 5.3.2 package in ubuntu
2010-04-28T08:59:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	That's correct.  Is there something keeping you on Dapper?
2010-04-28T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	What is it?
2010-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	manual installation is the only way.  That version of PHP is in Lucid (which will be released in two days) and Hardy has 5.2.10.
2010-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	Why is your boss insistent on Dapper?  Hardy is LTS as well, and Dapper is only supported for another 14 months.
2010-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	could you give me a quick ripdown on that to do? can i re-use the packaged apache?
2010-04-28T09:02:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	For now I dont care why he does. It will come back to haunt him at some time :D im just the peon doing the work :)
2010-04-28T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	Yeah, you just have to swap out php and libapache2-mod-php5.  You can't backport the packages from Lucid, because that'd require you to backport apache as well (Lucid uses apache2.2, Dapper uses apache2)
2010-04-28T09:03:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	okay, I found this howto: http://dan.drydog.com/apache2php.html but i seem to be missing axps ..
2010-04-28T09:05:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	You'll want to ask ##php for this, since you're basically just going to be compiling it yourself
2010-04-28T09:05:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	compiling php ist the hard part. its compiling it right to work with the packaged apache.
2010-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	Any chance in getting a hint on how to build php so that it works with the current apache package in dapper?
2010-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	That page looked pretty good.  What dependency were you missing?
2010-04-28T09:08:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	cant find axps :)
2010-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	And what paths to choose to it will run with apache
2010-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	Are you telling me to recompile apache?
2010-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	That page might help, with build-dep and stuff
2010-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	Flannel	patrick-1	No, I'm telling you to compile php and the php module for apache
2010-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	patrick-1	Flannel	okay, whatever. ill rebuild apache2 also...
