2009-11-13T06:08:00.000Z	randomusr		Jordan_U; kiba dock
2009-11-13T06:09:00.000Z	randomusr		Jordan_U; any suggestions?
2009-11-13T06:10:00.000Z	randomusr		Jordan_U; prolly not, considering that Daniel uploaded source code within 4 days ago, but they don't currently have a regular home page nor do they have an IRC channel
2009-11-13T06:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	for autogen.sh no sudo required; but try sudo "./autogen.sh" or sudo -s and then ./autogen.sh
2009-11-13T06:13:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	first sudo -s, enter password, then every command is as root, so then ./autogen.sh
2009-11-13T06:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	enter "exit" and you're back
2009-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	add proper repos and you'll have it; check enlightenment.org for debs from august, but I recommend compiling from svn, but it takes some time and you need to know a little what you're doing or use a proper howto
2009-11-21T05:57:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	have a proper how link?
2009-11-21T05:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	here's a good and uptodate howto; you can skip step 5 http://cafelinux.org/OzOs/content/how-install-ozos-desktop-existing-os
2009-11-21T05:58:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	step 5 is the ozos part, just a pack of apps to make it a proper desktop environment, you don't need it to have e17 running
2009-11-21T05:59:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	do I need to un-install Gnome?
2009-11-21T05:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	no, just follow the howto and e17 becomes an option in the session menu in your login screen
2009-11-21T06:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	you can also install openbox and kde and what not at the same time, and choose in your login screen
2009-11-21T06:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	not that that would be very useful, but still
2009-11-21T06:01:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	what about associating applications with the icons that I and and placing the programs I already have into the appropriate menus?
2009-11-21T06:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	that's copied from your normal ubuntu settings (the files are in ~/.local/share/applications) and the menu is also available in sort of the same way; no worries there
2009-11-21T06:03:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	any showstoppers/major annoyances from svn?
2009-11-21T06:04:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	it takes time, and development is fast so things can break; it is still alpha; but I've used it for 1,5 years now and it's pretty stable
2009-11-21T06:04:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	what's the latest stable that you're using?
2009-11-21T06:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	there is no latest stable with svn, I use 43487 now, that's from two weeks ago, they're already with 43854 now
2009-11-21T06:08:00.000Z	randomusr	VCoolio	how well does e17 work with compiz?
2009-11-21T06:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	randomusr	it doesn't; you can compile ecomorph which is a modification of compiz for e17; there is a howto for ecomorph on the same site
