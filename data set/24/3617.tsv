2008-05-04T21:11:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	thank you, I will search for it now
2008-05-04T21:14:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	I didn't have any luck finding it
2008-05-04T21:14:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	I did search for virtual consoles don't appear, and that bug didn't appear

2008-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	sorry I still can't find it
2008-05-04T21:21:00.000Z	jrib	white_eagle	k, it was just a suggestion, maybe you have a new problem.  If no one here knows, try the forums and mailing list as well
2008-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	I have a post about it in the forums
2008-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	ok, thanks anyway
2008-08-13T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	white_eagle	apt-get resolves dependencies for you automatically.  What are you doing exactly?
2008-08-13T01:08:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	look http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m766452d5
2008-08-13T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	white_eagle	that isn't a package from ubuntu's repositories
2008-08-13T01:08:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	i know
2008-08-13T01:09:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	ok, I solved the problem with running sudo aptitude -f (the package i install)
2008-08-13T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	white_eagle	make sure the repoitory it's coming from doesn't fubar your system
2008-08-13T01:10:00.000Z	white_eagle	jrib	ok
