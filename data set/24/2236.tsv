2009-03-01T12:15:00.000Z	hunt577		Ok, I was installing ubuntu and then it said that it couldn't finish installing and to check the CD/DVD, then when I went to restart the computer my Windows Vista won't come up, just a black screen with a cursor
2009-03-01T12:16:00.000Z	hunt577		what do I need to do to get Vista back?
2009-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	hunt577		my computer didn't come with any Vista disk
2009-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	hunt577		it won't apparently since there is something wrong with CD....wish it wouldn't have wiped out my computer before it installed
2009-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	hunt577		no dayo
2009-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	hunt577		I didn;t think it was going to take away Vista
2009-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	hunt577		nothing really
2009-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	hunt577		just a black screen with a cursor blinking
2009-03-01T12:20:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	you've lost your boot loader and i have no idea how to reinstall it in Windows 7 (couldn't even do it with Vista, but i think i could do it with XP)
2009-03-01T12:25:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	jschall if this helps??? Reinstall Grub after Windows Install / Boot off LiveCD / sudo grub / root (hd0,0) - setup (hd0) - exit
2009-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	jschall i'm not certain... is there any boot loader right now?
2009-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	jschall or just flashing cursor right?
2009-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	there is a sort of autocomplet in grub... it's kinda neat
2009-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	do you want to reinstall grub onto the MBR?
2009-03-01T12:43:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	try tying "root (hd<press the tab key>" but cancel the line out (DO NOT PRESS ENTER)
2009-03-01T12:44:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	it sould autocomplete a little and show you the possible drives
2009-03-01T12:46:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	like the TAB button on your keyboard, it should automatically type in probably "(hd0,0)" sorta thing
2009-03-01T12:46:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	is your prompt a ">"?
2009-03-01T12:48:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	is your prompt a ">"
2009-03-01T12:48:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	I thought you said you where in grub?
2009-03-01T12:49:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	jschall I thought is was in grub?  but the grub prompt is a >
2009-03-01T12:54:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	if you want to install grub to the MBR the line should look something like "root (hd0,0)" then press enter (step 1)
2009-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	the next line is like "setup (hd0)"
2009-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	hunt577	then type "exit" (step 3 - last step)
