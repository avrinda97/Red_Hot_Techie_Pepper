2010-07-07T20:42:00.000Z	GeO`		hmm I don't get something, I do df -h, then I delete large files, I do df -h again and nothing changed, does it take sometimes to update ?
2010-07-07T20:43:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	which large files did you delete?
2010-07-07T20:43:00.000Z	GeO`		a text file my website generated
2010-07-07T20:43:00.000Z	GeO`		I don't know
2010-07-07T20:44:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	if it does not go away it meant there's some process using that file...
2010-07-07T20:44:00.000Z	GeO`		the file is removed, but the df -h ddidn't change
2010-07-07T20:44:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	as soon as that process terminates it will make the space as available
2010-07-07T20:45:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	rob_p also has a good point: check the trash
2010-07-07T20:45:00.000Z	GeO`		It's a server I just have a shell, I used rm
2010-07-07T20:45:00.000Z	GeO`		yes
2010-07-07T20:45:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	 can you restart the services?
2010-07-07T20:45:00.000Z	GeO`		file.log actually, >100MB
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	GeO`		k I gonna try that
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	GeO`		btw could you have a look at my partitions please http://nopaste.gamedev.pl/?id=7666
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	it's the log for what?
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	GeO`		it was like that by default
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	GeO`	ve2dmn	it's a log generated by my website, concerning some activities
2010-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	GeO`		I think that my partitions are useless and I need more space in the main one, what can I do ? http://nopaste.gamedev.pl/?id=7666
2010-07-07T20:48:00.000Z	GeO`		/dev/md1
2010-07-07T20:48:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	if the file was still available you could check which process is using it with lsof or fuser
2010-07-07T20:49:00.000Z	GeO`		well I guess it was my bad...anyway, can I do something now concerning the partitions ? Maybe define them better, I don't know what to do
2010-07-07T20:50:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	if you used LVM it's possible to change the size of partitions live... if not, you'll have to use something else... or buy a new Hard drive
2010-07-07T20:53:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	to find your bigest file, try 'sudo du / | sort -n'
2010-07-07T20:53:00.000Z	ve2dmn	GeO`	(it might take some time)
