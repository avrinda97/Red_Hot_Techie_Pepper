2008-12-21T19:07:00.000Z	Stalker72		Are Nvidia drivers better than ATI drivers in Linux (for gaming, etc.)?
2008-12-21T19:07:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	they are better by leaps and bounds
2008-12-21T19:07:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	thx
2008-12-21T19:08:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	I'm buying a new comp, and I'm wondering if I'm buying Nvidia 260 or ATI 4870. I currently have the Nvidia 9800 GX2.
2008-12-21T19:08:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	i would keep the money and use the 9800
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	I'm selling the whole computer
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	So I can't ;)
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	then its nvidia
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	Ok, thx. It's more expensive thoug.
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	*though
2008-12-21T19:09:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	for how much ? :P
2008-12-21T19:10:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	How much the 260 costs?
2008-12-21T19:10:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	well you can find a cheaper nvidia that will work for linux just fine. unless you dual boot with win of course
2008-12-21T19:10:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	the entire system
2008-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	About $1,500
2008-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	wow
2008-12-21T19:11:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	The currency is high though
2008-12-21T19:15:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	Well, I converted the Norwegian price to USD, so it's kind of wrong.. :P
2008-12-21T19:16:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	..because the currency is extreme right now
2008-12-21T19:16:00.000Z	jim_p	Stalker72	well say it in euros :P
2008-12-21T19:16:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	I can say it in NOK.. :P
2008-12-21T19:16:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	For many months ago, I bought it for about 15k NOK. Now I'm selling it for about 10.5k NOK.
2008-12-21T19:16:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	Bought it in USA.
2008-12-21T19:17:00.000Z	Stalker72	jim_p	15k NOK = converted from USD when the currency was extremely low
