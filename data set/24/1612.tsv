2010-02-02T11:14:00.000Z	hylian		is there a way to get the system time to be 12 hour? not the clock, but the time you get when you type date in konsole.
2010-02-02T11:16:00.000Z	hylian		!date
2010-02-02T11:17:00.000Z	hylian		hey blake sounds like a very strange problem, ubuntu has never installed properly, or just now it isnt?
2010-02-02T11:17:00.000Z	hylian		!date
2010-02-02T11:19:00.000Z	hylian		i tried that, it was no help. there is a command fr date that makes it print 12 hour, but only once. i want system time to be 12 hour not 24 (not the clock, i can change that.)
2010-02-02T11:19:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	have you checked for documentation on that?
2010-02-02T11:20:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	good 'ol learnin' time, unless you can find a pre-written script
2010-02-02T11:24:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	are you saying i should script this? what i dont get with linux is why most of what i want to do has to be scripted by me. why isnt there a simple on off switch like most other os's? i suppose the answer would be that linux was developed in a country that uses 24 hour time format.
2010-02-02T11:25:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	no..not exactly.  It's just something that is free.  They coded it the way they did and said "meh".  It isn't something that will be more than a few lines.  What are you trying to get to read in 12 hour format?
2010-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	the actual system time, (NOT the clock). for instance, after entering a terminal, you can type date and you will get a nice time date stamp. i want the time date stamp to use 12 hour time. (my whole system is already set to 12 hour time, but still does not affect the system clock for some reason)

2010-02-02T11:34:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	there's a pre-written script
2010-02-02T11:35:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	there's always the open-source radeon driver for x1300
2010-02-02T11:35:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	i have x1900, and it's in the legacy list too
2010-02-02T11:35:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	it is the largest waste of space on the planet earth. to say  it barely works is giving it too much credit.
2010-02-02T11:35:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	true.
2010-02-02T11:36:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	thanx for the info though. no im gonna be a fan of pclinuxos2009 untill ubuntu supports my card again. what they did to make my old driver not work i dont know, but pclinuxos proves it isnt needed.
2010-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	it's ati's fault, not ubuntu's
2010-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	ubuntu is a community effort.  If there isn't enough support, people don't build it
2010-02-02T11:43:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	sorry. it's atleast 50% ubuntu's fault.
2010-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	you can't blame ubuntu for not supporting your card.
2010-02-02T11:44:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	it doesn't work that way
2010-02-02T11:45:00.000Z	toastedmilk	hylian	yeah i'll zip it as well
2010-02-02T11:46:00.000Z	hylian	toastedmilk	thanx for explaining it, but ubuntu's not helping me has forced me into another distro that does help me, 'nough said. hmm.
