2008-08-06T21:19:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		is there anything wrong with this sudo line
2008-08-06T21:19:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		 $result = shell_exec("sudo -u root -p rootpass -S whoami");
2008-08-06T21:20:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	is that PhP ?
2008-08-06T21:20:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		a script magnetron
2008-08-06T21:20:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		its hard coded into a script
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	that's silly .. using sudo just to run whoami
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		nah its just for a test unop
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		to see if the script is identifying as root
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		whats the command line to use sudo and specify a password in it?
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		sudo -u root -p pass -S command
2008-08-06T21:21:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		?
2008-08-06T21:22:00.000Z	bsdnewb039	magnetron	what should it be
2008-08-06T21:23:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	echo "password" | sudo -S whoami
2008-08-06T21:23:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		ty
2008-08-06T21:23:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	but you're aware that this seriously going to compromise your system if someone has access to the script
2008-08-06T21:24:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	i'd seriously recommend rethinking this design
2008-08-06T21:24:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		id?
2008-08-06T21:25:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		its for a web control panel
2008-08-06T21:25:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		i need root to edit the configs and things
2008-08-06T21:25:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	this is not the way you should be doing it
2008-08-06T21:25:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		oh
2008-08-06T21:26:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		write a script executed as root?
2008-08-06T21:26:00.000Z	bsdnewb039		i cant execute from root if its been called as apache though
2008-08-06T21:27:00.000Z	unop	bsdnewb039	php has something called suexec - you should look at it
