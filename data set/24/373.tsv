2012-01-07T06:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	yeap, purge then re-install the original
2012-01-07T06:49:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	the problem is that aptitude will remove all my programs with gnome-shell
2012-01-07T06:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	yes, it might, let it, then when done have it all re-install, re-installing 'ubuntu-desktop' after you system is stripped clean will leave you with a fresh system
2012-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	but it will need to be done at the terminal, maybe, because stuff may dis-appear as you progress
2012-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	my configurations will not be erased?
2012-01-07T06:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	no, dont touch your /home/ folder
2012-01-07T06:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	dont restart
2012-01-15T02:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	noticed 'all my configs'??? besides wallpaper what?
2012-01-15T02:48:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	wallpaper, gnome-shell extensions, favorites, themes, etc
2012-01-15T02:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	i am assuming you dont back up your home folder, yes?
2012-01-15T02:51:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	i don care about losing my configs, just care about my files
2012-01-15T02:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	it is strange to 'just lose' them, you sure the loss process did not get a little assistance?
2012-01-15T02:52:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	the only thing I did yesterday was a apt-get upgrade
2012-01-15T02:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	when you look in your home folder you dont see the docs you created in the past?
2012-01-15T02:54:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	my files are OK
2012-01-15T02:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	ok, we are back to the configuration of your desktop then, that is all that changed
2012-01-15T02:55:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	yes
2012-01-15T02:56:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	every time i try to change the wallpaper nothing happens, and when I add my gnome-shell favorites again, they disappear after a reboot
2012-01-15T02:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	are you logging into a desktop that is not the one you usually log into? say unity2d/verses unity, or gnome simple/verser blingy? i forget the two gnome option names
2012-01-15T02:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	now? as in you were in something else before?
2012-01-15T02:58:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	I usually just use gnome-shell, I logged into unity to see if the problem happens here too
2012-01-15T02:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	gnome-shell is not unity, expect differences
2012-01-15T03:00:00.000Z	Akiyama-san	almoxarife	I know, but the same problem happens in both
2012-01-15T03:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	Akiyama-san	to fix it you need the backup, you dont have it, i have one last thing to recommend and i am out of answers, i assume you are in 11.10, there is a back up scheme, rather simple and effective, i use it for times just like the one you presented
