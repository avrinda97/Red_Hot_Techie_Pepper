2009-10-13T01:26:00.000Z	jph_		anyone know a lot about php?
2009-10-13T01:28:00.000Z	jph_		is there a relatively simple way to have a page look in a folder and create a link to all the files in that folder.... i.e. if you have a folder with 100 images could you have php look in that folder and create a link on the page that is displayed to the user that is the filename of each of those files so that the user can then open or download that file?
2009-10-13T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	ask ##php
2009-10-13T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	it means this channel is for ubuntu support, but you are asking a php question so you should join the ##php channel on this network and ask your question there
2010-01-25T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	did you also say apt-get update didn't work?
2010-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	yes I did say that
2010-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	did you fix that?
2010-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	negative I bet they are related but I don't know where to start so i came here
2010-01-25T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	right, that's my bet too :)  pastebin your command and the output when you run « sudo apt-get update »
2010-01-25T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	"jrib" instead of "jrub" if you want me to get a highlight :)
2010-01-25T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	is your internet working otherwise?
2010-01-25T07:46:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	yes it works, I am SSHed in to that box and also have terminal access to the back via hardwired KVM
2010-01-25T07:47:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	if you need me to test the internet on that box let me know how you would like me to
2010-01-25T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	nslookup us.archive.ubuntu.com    works ok?
2010-01-25T07:48:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	it failed
2010-01-25T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	it's a dns issue then
2010-01-25T07:49:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	connection timed out
2010-01-25T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	I don't really know too much about this, but what is in /etc/resolv.conf ?
2010-01-25T07:51:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	before we get to that let me run this thought by you, we are behind firewalls here I have access to modify them... that server has the following and only the following ports opened up on it 22,80,433,53    could this be the root of my problem?
2010-01-25T07:53:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	hmm.  Well apt-get either uses http or ftp (looks like that should be ok). As for the dns lookups, I don't know what you need to do firewall-wise if anything
2010-01-25T07:55:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	ok well where would you like to start as far and finding the problem...
2010-01-25T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	jph_	pastebin /etc/resolv.conf is a good start
2010-01-25T07:57:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	ok will do
2010-01-25T07:58:00.000Z	jph_	jrib	no need to pastbin it is as follows: first line 'search us'  second line 'nameserver 10.12.1.1'
