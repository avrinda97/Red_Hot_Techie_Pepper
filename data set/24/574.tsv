2012-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	tarzeau		does ubuntu 1204 work for anyone with more than one screen?
2012-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	tarzeau		with the nvidia driver? i either get mirrored displays or logins don't work at all
2012-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	tarzeau		using gnome, gnome classic, unity, unity 2d etc...
2012-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	tarzeau		amiwm or window maker work though
2012-07-11T17:32:00.000Z	tarzeau		we have like 150 workstations and they're still on 1104 because of this and some other problems with 1204lts
2012-07-11T17:33:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	get gentoo, it might fix your problem haha
2012-07-11T17:33:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	we had debian before and i just tried debian wheezy and that's even worse
2012-07-11T17:34:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	there's no way we're gonna use gentoo
2012-07-11T17:34:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	i know
2012-07-11T17:35:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	funny thing is it works also with mate and e17
2012-07-11T17:35:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	then get mate on there. (tbh, i've been heavily disappointed with Unity)
2012-07-11T17:36:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	using mate would lower the shock of a change as well.
2012-07-11T17:37:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	move your entire office to i3wm.
2012-07-11T17:38:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	some people just don't want to switch away from gnome 2 or kde
2012-07-11T17:39:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	also, how hard is it to package more on a local repo?
2012-07-11T17:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	not so, but to keep it updated is
2012-07-11T17:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	and then there's 32+64bit and all the distros that you have during the migration
2012-07-11T17:46:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	another questions, why would you not just use the public repositories?
2012-07-11T17:47:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	public repos of what?
2012-07-11T17:48:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	why not use the public repos /and/ your own repos for the software you can't get?
2012-07-11T17:49:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	that's what we do? but that doesn't fix the unity/gnome/kde problems on multimonitor setups?
2012-07-11T17:50:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	use LXDE/XFCE? or in that case, get RHEL.
2012-07-11T17:50:00.000Z	tarzeau	KaiSforza	look it's not ME having problems, since I use amiwm/windowmaker which just work, perfect. it's the 2999 other people that can't use anything else but unity, gnome and kde
2012-07-11T17:51:00.000Z	KaiSforza	tarzeau	dress up LXDE to look like gnome 2.
