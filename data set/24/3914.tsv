2007-09-05T06:05:00.000Z	rainerf		hi all! is there some way to install specific packages from gutsy in feisty without doing a complete dist-upgrade?
2007-09-05T06:06:00.000Z	rainerf		i don't want to update to the beta of gutsy, but i need the newer nvidia driver...
2007-09-05T06:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	There is no beta yet ;)
2007-09-05T06:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	And using the gutsy nvidia driver most likely won't work.
2007-09-05T06:07:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	hehe, k, i don't want to install the alpha either ;)...
2007-09-05T06:07:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	You can try envy: http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
2007-09-05T06:07:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	hm, isn't there some way to tell aptitude or something to just pull in the one package from gutsy (with its dependencies of course)?
2007-09-05T06:08:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	There is, but it would also install the gutsy kernel... and this might break hundreds of other things.
2007-09-05T06:08:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	Drivers are not just like applications, they are tied to the kernel.
2007-09-05T06:09:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	hm, i don't mind installing the newer kernel, been using gentoo for years.. i just don't want to clutter up my fs with installing the proprietary driver from their script...
2007-09-05T06:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	envy is most probably the easiest way to get a new nvidia driver. Not that I ever used it. :)
2007-09-05T06:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	In that case you should find out how to package a self-compiled nvidia driver... still easier than pulling the gutsy kernel imho... but that might be wrong. :)
2007-09-05T06:10:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	hehe, the message from ubotu makes me wonder if envy is so good ;)
2007-09-05T06:10:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	Seeing that many people want newer nvidia drivers, I'm pretty sure somebody already packaged it anyway... try the forums?
2007-09-05T06:11:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	yeah, i've been searching for it, but all i could find was a hotwo which was using the installer's script
2007-09-05T06:11:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	how would i tell aptitude to install just that one package + deps of gutsy?
2007-09-05T06:11:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	Also, manually installing the driver won't clutter your fs... I'm pretty sure it's only a couple of files in a seperate directory in /lib/modules.
2007-09-05T06:11:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	in case something breaks that's not too bad, i'd just install kubuntu again ;)
2007-09-05T06:12:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	hm.. i'd still prefer using the one package from gutsy... just can't figure out how to install it in feisty...
2007-09-05T06:12:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	No idea about the gutsy kernel thing... there must be some documentation online, because I heard it's necessary for feisty users on MacBook to use a newer kernel (because of wireless)

2007-09-05T06:14:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	aah, thanks a lot, that was exactly what i was looking for :)
2007-09-05T06:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	rainerf	It even has some suggestions for nvidia ;)
2007-09-05T06:15:00.000Z	rainerf	Tomcat_	yeah, just saw this too... thanks :-)
