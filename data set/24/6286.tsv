2006-08-30T15:00:00.000Z	notworkin		i dont know what that is
2006-08-30T15:01:00.000Z	notworkin		i need someone to explain it.. i had a boot disk but it wont boot and i think its cause ubuntu is on it
2006-08-30T15:02:00.000Z	notworkin		im sorry... i kinda need a walk through of a sort... i was able to when windows was on... with fdisk. but i am confused now...
2006-08-30T15:02:00.000Z	notworkin		where can i get that fdisk and can i boot it from a cd
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		in the terminal
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		i typed that and a list came up
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		but nothing really happened
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		oh
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		ok
2006-08-30T15:03:00.000Z	notworkin		lets see
2006-08-30T15:04:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	try   fdisk -l /dev/hda    the -l prints something, and is safe
2006-08-30T15:04:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	gone is easy.  getting it back when it's gone may not be  :)
2006-08-30T15:13:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	I don't think he was serious
2006-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	during the install, you don't do anything called "format"
2006-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	format is incorrect
2006-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	you create a file system.
2006-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	there is such a think as a low level format on an IDE drive, but you should never need to do it.
2006-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	in that case, just boot a windows install cd
2006-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	windows is good at erasing everything other than itself  :)
2006-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	won't boot the cd?
2006-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	try going into your bios setup, and looking for boot options
2006-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	and make the CD the first boot device
2006-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	didn't boot?
2006-08-30T15:16:00.000Z	sethk	notworkin	either the cd is bad, or the drive has a problem, or the drive cable has a problem, or the drive is jumpered incorrectly
