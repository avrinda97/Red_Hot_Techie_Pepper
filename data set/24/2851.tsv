2008-07-23T22:44:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		I'm trying to create one
2008-07-23T22:44:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		this is the problem,
2008-07-23T22:44:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu to my laptop as a dual boot. When I try to partition the drive using the partitioner on the Ubuntu disk, I get an error that says "Resize operation failure. An error occurred while writing the changes to the storage devices. The resize operation has been aborted."
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		but when I try it again, i get the same error
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		what do you mean?
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		I did!
2008-07-23T22:47:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		There's only one partition on my hard drive right now, becuase I only have windows installed
2008-07-23T22:47:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		Right? Sorry, I'm new to this
2008-07-23T22:47:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		yes EvilDennisR
2008-07-23T22:49:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	you might be better off resizing the partition from within windows to create the blank space for new partitions.
2008-07-23T22:49:00.000Z	Mr_Duck	mikere	how do I go about doing this?
2008-07-23T22:50:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	what version of windows?
2008-07-23T22:50:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		xp service pack 2
2008-07-23T22:50:00.000Z	Mr_Duck	mikere	xp service pack 2
2008-07-23T22:51:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	you'd go to control panel and then I think computer management and disk management and do it from there.
2008-07-23T22:51:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		Ok, thanks mikere
2008-07-23T22:52:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	of course I'm saying that straight from memory - google might give you a more reliable answer =)
2008-07-23T22:52:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	and the advice about defragging that windows partition before resizing is a VERY GOOD idea
2008-07-23T22:53:00.000Z	Mr_Duck	mikere	yeah, I've already defragged, but should I defrag again after I've partitioned?
2008-07-23T22:53:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	nope - and I think I might be wrong about xp being able to downsize a partition - I'm just looking it up right now
2008-07-23T22:54:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		ok mikere, thanks
2008-07-23T22:56:00.000Z	mikere	Mr_Duck	you could give it a try - but it might not be capable of shrinking.
2008-07-23T22:57:00.000Z	Mr_Duck	mikere	are you talking about defragmenting?
