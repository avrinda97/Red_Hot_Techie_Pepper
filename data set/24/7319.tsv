2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	raphael74		yeah... It's all under control but I had a few issues
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	racoontje	raphael74	in warty or in hoary
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	raphael74		the main one is that I use a french keyboard yet I want my locale to be in english
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	raphael74		in warty
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	racoontje	raphael74	locale as in language?
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	raphael74		and the default keyboard became english
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	raphael74		yes racoontje
2005-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	racoontje	raphael74	that's totally possible, just set location to english/us and set keymap to latin1
2005-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	racoontje		ehh
2005-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	racoontje		azerty/fr...
2005-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	raphael74	racoontje	its all fixed now but I call it a glitch that it was not done automatically as during the install I did select the french keyboard
2005-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	racoontje	raphael74	was the keyboard in french mode in console?
2005-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	racoontje		I used a Belgian (too, Azerty) keyboard for one of my installs, and it worked fine in both console and gnome
2005-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	raphael74	racoontje	mmmm I am not sure. but which kind of language did you select for the installation? Did you select french or english
