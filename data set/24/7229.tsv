2005-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	netpuppy		speaking of -dev packages.. is there a way to always get headers etc. installed with a package?
2005-03-24T15:07:00.000Z	netpuppy		go use jhbuild ;)
2005-03-24T15:09:00.000Z	netpuppy		why not say ?indows then?
2005-03-24T15:09:00.000Z	netpuppy		:)
2005-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	netpuppy		grr... it's freaking annoying that the ubuntu packaged fglrx drivers are so out-dated
2005-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	in warty?
2005-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	what is the latest driver?
2005-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	hoary
2005-03-24T15:12:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	6.8.0-8.8.25
2005-03-24T15:12:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	yes?
2005-03-24T15:12:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	seems like this version is for xorg 6.8.0 and is the fglrx drive version 8.8.25
2005-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	its not that old ?
2005-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	lets do a math test... which is the higher number, 8 or 10?
2005-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	lets look at the site instead shall we?
2005-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	the current version has a bug so you can't use Xv together with tv-out
2005-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	February 17, 2005 -> 8.10.19
2005-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	yep
2005-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	January 29, 2005 -> 8.8.25-2
2005-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	like I said...not that old
2005-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	that's a month - considering ati's promise to release new linux drivers every second month I'd consider that to be outdated
2005-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	ok
2005-03-24T15:17:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	make a package then? :)
2005-03-24T15:18:00.000Z	netpuppy	scizzo	tried that
2005-03-24T15:25:00.000Z	scizzo	netpuppy	hehe
