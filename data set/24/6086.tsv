2006-01-22T11:46:00.000Z	frazmanw		I have sound working but if I load any games I have no sound. Any ideas?
2006-01-22T11:47:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	disable esd via System> Preferences> Sound> Enable sound server startup   prior to starting your game, and reenable it when you exit your game
2006-01-22T11:48:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	many games use oss [emulation] , which hog the sound device
2006-01-22T11:48:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	I didn't have to do that with my last install, there was a library or something missing, i just forget what it was. I am talking little simple games
2006-01-22T11:48:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	thus you can't expect to hear system sounds when you're playing an oss game unless you use the aoss script, part of the alsa-oss package
2006-01-22T11:57:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	I had this problem a month ago on another machine, someone in here told me to install something, I think lib??? and then it worked. the way it is not is like it was on the other maching before doing that, sound settings are not even on in the games. there is something missing
2006-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	what lib?
2006-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	perhaps it's easier if you say which game
2006-01-22T12:00:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	dpkg -l libsdl1.2debian-alsa|grep ^ii
2006-01-22T12:03:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	ok, it did nothing?
2006-01-22T12:04:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian-alsa
2006-01-22T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	it's fine if by installing that package other libsdl1.2debian* ones are removed
2006-01-22T12:05:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	they are i am trying now
2006-01-22T12:06:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	worked, thank you very much. that must have been it
2006-01-22T12:06:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	excellent
2006-01-22T12:06:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	is there a reason not to use  libsdl1.2debian-esd??? since i have things set to esd?
2006-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	well, if you have esd running, sure you can install libsdl1.2debian-esd, but I think you'll find that performance suffers
2006-01-22T12:07:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	also which should I set as my sound esd or alsa, in gentoo I always used alsa
2006-01-22T12:08:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	the defaults should suffice, but the distro is migrating away from esd
2006-01-22T12:08:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	to alsa?
2006-01-22T12:08:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	yes
2006-01-22T12:08:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	you are great thanks!
2006-01-22T12:10:00.000Z	frazmanw	crimsun	know anything about ATI drivers? I am using the ones in apt, wondering if I should switch to latest ATI. (performance increase?)
2006-01-22T12:10:00.000Z	crimsun	frazmanw	I don't, sorry
