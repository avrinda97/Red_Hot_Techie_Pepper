2011-01-15T01:52:00.000Z	NooBoontoo		So, why do you think WINE could just fail?
2011-01-15T01:52:00.000Z	NooBoontoo		Is it because I insttalled something incopatible with WINE?
2011-01-15T01:52:00.000Z	NooBoontoo		I reinstalled WINE and still
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	Did you install wine via the instructions at WineHQ.org?
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	I compiled the 1.2.2 version like the readme file told me, but then I reinstalled 1.2.1 from Synaptic
2011-01-15T01:56:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	No you should be fine
2011-01-15T01:56:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	The instructions from WineHQ setup a PPA, which will override Ubuntu's official Wine install, and even update it as if it were the official install
2011-01-15T02:01:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	At winehq.org, there should be a version for 10.10
2011-01-15T02:02:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	http://www.winehq.org/download/deb
2011-01-15T02:02:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	There is not
2011-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	Is it ok if I use just like this?  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
2011-01-15T02:03:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	Yup
2011-01-15T02:04:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	And after that you will need to run "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install wine" or "sudo apt-get install wine1.3" if you want the beta version
2011-01-15T02:05:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	Since you've already tried 1.2.2, you should try the beta 1.3
2011-01-15T02:06:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	I tought the 1.3 version was gonna be automatically appear in the update manager... but no
2011-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	Install it with "sudo apt-get install wine1.3"
2011-01-15T02:07:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	That's the newest one you can download
2011-01-15T02:08:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	Ok thanks, I'll try that after I update
2011-01-15T02:11:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	You seem like someone who knows, so, do you know how to fix the Nvidia xorg?
2011-01-15T02:11:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	Don't know, actually. Never worked with Nv much
2011-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	The problem here is, Everytime I login to Ubuntu, my  screen resolution allways is messed up, I go to root and change it and then save it, but still, everytime I login is the same
2011-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	oh... ok, thx anyway
2011-01-15T02:12:00.000Z	undecim	NooBoontoo	You might be able to just put a Modeline in your Xorg.conf
2011-01-15T02:14:00.000Z	NooBoontoo	undecim	If I only knew what a Modeline is! What colbe wrong with that xserver, why does not accept the new xorg file?!
