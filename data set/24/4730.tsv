2007-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	workrave on xubuntu
2007-01-25T14:10:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	workrave is available as a package
2007-01-25T14:10:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	 i got the .deb package but it wouldnt install on xubuntu
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	have you seen synaptic? :/
2007-01-25T14:11:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	 yes synaptic doesnt have it
2007-01-25T14:12:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	mine has.
2007-01-25T14:13:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	yes, I have universe and multiverse
2007-01-25T14:14:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	 I tried going to synaptic and ticking the other 2 boxes in "repositories" but it fails when it tries to reload.
2007-01-25T14:15:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	 I have http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf/ and http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu set in synaptic.  Are these the repositories you speak of ?
2007-01-25T14:16:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	plf and canonicals commercial repos are unnecessary for workrave
2007-01-25T14:16:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	can you please tell me how to add the necessary repos' .
2007-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	sdac221x	decaf	 i tried following guides on the internet but it did work when i try to reload in synaptic
2007-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	decaf	sdac221x	let me clean up my sources.list file and send to you
