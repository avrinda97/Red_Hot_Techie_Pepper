2009-06-24T17:05:00.000Z	Pici	rek	Is this an Ubuntu question? Or perhaps it would be more on-topic in #winehq or ##windows
2009-06-24T17:06:00.000Z	Pici	rek	The folks in #winehq should be able to help you with that
2009-07-21T00:40:00.000Z	Pici	rek	What does this have to do with Ubuntu support?
2009-07-21T00:41:00.000Z	Pici	rek	Then you can private message him.  This doesn't look like it has anything to do with Ubuntu Support, which is the topic of this channel.
2009-07-24T18:34:00.000Z	Pici	rek	ogra is obviously not responding to you, its best to ask your question here, with as many details as possible on one line.
2009-07-24T18:40:00.000Z	Pici	rek	This is the UBUNTU support channel, we cannot support other distros here.  Please seek out the channel for your distro or ask in ##linux
2009-07-24T18:41:00.000Z	Pici	rek	Its NOT Ubuntu.
2009-07-24T18:43:00.000Z	Pici	rek	There are other channels on this network, try ##linux to start. We cannot and will not support things that are not Ubuntu here. End of discussion.
2009-07-27T19:15:00.000Z	Pici	rek	What?
2009-07-27T19:18:00.000Z	Pici	rek	I don't know much about idesk, but from those errors I'd make sure that 1) The target of Background.File exists 2) That idesk wasn't running already when you tried to start it.
2009-07-27T19:19:00.000Z	Pici	rek	Then I don't know, I've never used that software before.
2009-07-27T19:25:00.000Z	Pici	rek	Maybe #fluxbox would be a better place to ask
2009-08-11T18:30:00.000Z	Pici	rek	No, its not.  ##hardware would be the best place to ask.
2009-08-18T18:01:00.000Z	rek	Pici	 Dr_Willis: : nvidia proprietary drivers don't work on 9.04 i can't see it in system administration hardware drivers help........
2010-01-16T00:16:00.000Z	Pici	rek	er, okay?
2010-01-16T00:28:00.000Z	Pici	rek	I don't know, I've never used the program.
2010-08-05T19:03:00.000Z	rek	Pici	 can i print something with a printer connected to a win pc in my home?
2010-08-05T19:08:00.000Z	Pici	rek	No you don't. Everything that you need to do that is already built in to Ubuntu,
