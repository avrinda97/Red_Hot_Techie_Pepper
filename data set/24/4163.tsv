2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Anybody else have this problem with Azureus? I set it to open my torrents, but when I double click them it loads but does nothing.
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Same deal in firefox.
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		I physically have to go File > Open Torrent
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Oh shit wrong channel
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		hahaha
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		But if anyone knows, let me know.
2007-06-29T05:19:00.000Z	Ausicaemia		Cause its very annoying.
2007-06-29T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	write a script taht strips out the "file://" part that gets passed to azureus
2007-06-29T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	ubuntuforums has a thread about it
2007-06-29T05:22:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	Do know what the title is so I can keyword it? Or do you have a link?
2007-06-29T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	not offhand, no.  If you can't find it, ping me and I'll search
2007-06-29T05:48:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	I've done about 12 searches and haven't found anything.
2007-06-29T05:55:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	ugh I wish people on the forums would press "search" instead of starting new topic, now I have to wade through hundreds of threads with the same exact issue and find the one with the solution explained... Can you try this in a terminal first:  azureuous /path/to/torrent    does that work?
2007-06-29T05:56:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	I know what you mean, I've been doing the same thing haha. At least you know what you're looking for.
2007-06-29T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	I can explain to you the solution, it will be faster.  But check that that command works first, so we can make sure it's the same issue.
2007-06-29T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	then it must be a different issue than what I knew about
2007-06-29T06:00:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	Well basically, the files are associated with azureus but when double clicked they don't get imported.
2007-06-29T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	I just tried here and azureus core dumps on me if I give it the path to a torrent
2007-06-29T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	did you give the absolute path to azureus?
2007-06-29T06:03:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	I even renamed it to something simple.
2007-06-29T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	hmm, it works here when I do: azureus /home/jrib/torrents/foo.torrent     but not if I do: azureus foo.torrent
2007-06-29T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	what out do you get in the terminal?  Does azureus give any gui notification that a file was passed?
2007-06-29T06:05:00.000Z	Ausicaemia	jrib	azureus /home/brendan/Desktop/torrent.torrent
2007-06-29T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	Ausicaemia	what version of ubuntu?
