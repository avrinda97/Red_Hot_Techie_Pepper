2010-11-01T07:32:00.000Z	tortoise		alright, I'm having a very frustrating time with this error message: "Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode." I've been trying to fix it for several hours and I've gotten nowhere. Is there anyone that can help me with this?
2010-11-01T07:33:00.000Z	tortoise		also, I think it's https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31154 this bug
2010-11-01T07:33:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	what graphic card
2010-11-01T07:34:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	not sure if you saw that. But just in case, it's an ATI Radeon X1200
2010-11-01T07:35:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	nope didn't.. sounds like an older one is that right?
2010-11-01T07:35:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	yeah, it is
2010-11-01T07:36:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	I'm not sure if the drivers have caught up with it .. when x.org changed to 7.x or was it 1.7x something like that.. it broke compatability for older ati cards and ati decited to put efforts into their newer stuff first.. not sure if there is a fix or not.
2010-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	perhaps in ##linux
2010-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	how do you mean "earlier".. on 8.04 or 9.10?
2010-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	any recent updates?
2010-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	none
2010-11-01T07:38:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	I was restarting to get back in ubuntu (I was in vista doing something) and when I booted ubunut up it gave me that error
2010-11-01T07:39:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	do a full update with .. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade .. then look in system>admin>hardware drivers and see if there's something there to activate.
2010-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	hadn't thought of that.. is this a Wubi install?
2010-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	do the update as a first step
2010-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	which update?
2010-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	check for your highlight line from me above..
2010-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	do a full update with .. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade .. then look in system>admin>hardware drivers and see if there's something there to activate.
2010-11-01T07:43:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	I'm in cli, because I can't access the gui with this error. But when I did the upgrade there was apparently nothing to upgrade to. 0 upgraded, 0 newly, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2010-11-01T07:44:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	well.. it was worth a shot.. sorry I'm not much of an ati person.. I've no idea how to fix it.
2010-11-01T07:44:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	sigh, no one seems to know anything about this error. DO you have any suggestions for where else to ask for help?
2010-11-01T07:45:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	maybe in ##linux. I had the same on my install with nvidia.. I needed to install the binary driver to fix it.. it may also have something to do with xrandr which controls screen resoution etc.
2010-11-01T07:46:00.000Z	tortoise	izinucs	alright I'll check those out. Thanks for the help
2010-11-01T07:46:00.000Z	izinucs	tortoise	good luck
