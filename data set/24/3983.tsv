2012-11-25T08:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis__	OpenSorce	 never seen that error/message - just using normal ext4 here
2012-11-25T08:09:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Dr_Willis__	"It appears that you do not have extended file system attributes enabled, please enable the user_xattr option for your filesystem and try again." is the whole message, no reason not to enable it I guess
2012-11-25T09:17:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Dr_Willis__	Well the netflix thing works but it's a bit choppy gonna try with a lighter weight DE, maybe LXDE of XFCE
2012-11-25T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis__	OpenSorce	 what do you expect from wine running firefox ;)
2012-11-25T09:40:00.000Z	OpenSorce	Dr_Willis__	the netflix thing starts ff for windows under wine in kiosk mode for some reason, but you hit F11 it fixes that
