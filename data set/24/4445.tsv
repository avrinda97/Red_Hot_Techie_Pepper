2009-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	hikenboot		hello all can anyone tell me where i can find libva-dev for intrepid
2009-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	do you mean libvala-dev?
2009-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	because there's no libva-dev
2009-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	no vaapi-dev either. what are you trying to do?
2009-01-03T06:02:00.000Z	hikenboot	wj32	trying to get on video card processing support for my nvidia card so I can offload mpeg processing from the cpu
2009-01-03T06:02:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	VA-API
2009-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	isn't that really new? the only page i can find is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mobile-hw-decode
2009-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	hikenboot	wj32	yes
2009-01-03T06:04:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	the page says its going to be implemented. so you'll just have to wait :(
2009-01-03T06:50:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	are the programs you're trying to use with VA-API actually compiled with support for that?
2009-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	hikenboot	wj32	yes they are the beta invidia driver contains the ability to use it
2009-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	are you writing your own program or are you using a media player/encoder?
2009-01-03T06:52:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	the thing is does ubuntu have the newest mplayer with support for va-api
2009-01-03T06:52:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	surely they would include libva in the repositories if mplayer depended on it
2009-01-03T08:59:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	no, you can't do that easily
2009-01-03T09:00:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	not easily
2009-01-03T09:00:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	well no
2009-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	you could try and install it again
2009-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	this time logging the files it adds
2009-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	oh i see you're trying to get that va-api thing working
2009-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	apt-get?
2009-01-03T09:02:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	in that case you can just reinstall mplayer
2009-01-03T09:02:00.000Z	wj32	hikenboot	unless when you did make install it installed to /usr/local
2009-01-03T09:05:00.000Z	hikenboot	wj32	sorry looking perhaps i could use build-dep
