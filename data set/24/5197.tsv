2007-12-16T05:50:00.000Z	lewis		Hey there. I have installed Ubuntu Studio on my laptop but am getting an Error "Failed to start the X server (graphical interface)". Does anybody know what's wrong here and how to fix it? Thanks in advance.
2007-12-16T05:50:00.000Z	wols	lewis	check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log and pastebin its contents
2007-12-16T05:59:00.000Z	wols	lewis	nothing
2007-12-16T06:06:00.000Z	wols	lewis	what IS the error? you didn't tell us yet
2007-12-16T06:06:00.000Z	wols	lewis	the one you told us is not the error
2007-12-16T06:09:00.000Z	wols	lewis	this si NOT the error. I told you to put your /var/log/Xorg.0.log in a pastebin
2007-12-16T06:10:00.000Z	wols	lewis	how do you open a file?
2007-12-16T06:10:00.000Z	wols	lewis	especially a text file
2007-12-16T06:15:00.000Z	wols	lewis	sudo grep (EE) /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	lewis	wols	do I include the (EE)
2007-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	wols	lewis	you include what I wrote
2007-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	lewis	wols	syntax error near unexpected token '('
2007-12-16T06:19:00.000Z	lewis	wols	syntax error near unexpected token '('
2007-12-16T06:20:00.000Z	wols	lewis	use "(EE)" then
2007-12-16T06:22:00.000Z	lewis	wols	it came up with "(WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown
2007-12-16T06:23:00.000Z	lewis	wols	it came up with "(WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown
2007-12-16T06:23:00.000Z	wols	lewis	then you gotta pastebin it
2007-12-16T06:23:00.000Z	lewis	wols	Can't even get onto anything on the laptop Ubuntu is installed on.
2007-12-16T06:24:00.000Z	wols	lewis	you ahve a terminal, so that's not true
2007-12-16T06:26:00.000Z	lewis	wols	The OS isn't functioning. Nothing 'graphical' comes up - just a blue box with the thing i told you earlier. I can make my way to a terminal which is what i've been using all this time you've been giving me instructions. It works the same as a normal terminal
2007-12-16T06:27:00.000Z	wols	lewis	when the kernel, init and bash load which apparently do, it IS functioning. a terminal is a functioning OS
2007-12-16T06:28:00.000Z	lewis	wols	i cant effectively access it properly. i get stopped at this blue screen thing asking if i want diagnose or not
2007-12-16T06:28:00.000Z	wols	lewis	ctrl+alt+f2 and you have a terminal
2007-12-16T06:28:00.000Z	wols	lewis	and that's all you ever need
