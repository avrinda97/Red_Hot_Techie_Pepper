2008-12-03T04:03:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100		I get permission denied when i try to move a file to/from my external hard drive. What should I do?

2008-12-03T04:04:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	how do i check?
2008-12-03T04:04:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	is it mounted?
2008-12-03T04:05:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	yes i can mkdir in it also, i just cant transfer files
2008-12-03T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	pastebin the output of the command: mount
2008-12-03T04:05:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	i have no network connectivity on that box :(
2008-12-03T04:06:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	I can run the command but not pastebin
2008-12-03T04:06:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	mount should tell you the filesystem
2008-12-03T04:07:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	vfat
2008-12-03T04:09:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	what command do you run and what output do you get when you try to copy a file?
2008-12-03T04:12:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	'mv /home/myusername/netfilesxxxxx.tar /wdext' OUTPUT: mv: cannot create regular file '/wdext/netfilesxxxxx.tar' : Permission denied
2008-12-03T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	touch /wdext/touch_test
2008-12-03T04:13:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	cannot touch: permission denied
2008-12-03T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	ls -ld /wdext
2008-12-03T04:14:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	drwxr-xr-x 25 root root 32768 2008-12-02 16:57 /wdext
2008-12-03T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	how are you mounting this partition?  In fstab?  If so, with what options?
2008-12-03T04:15:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	i did "sudo mount  /dev/sdc1 /wdext"
2008-12-03T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	you want to use some options, so your user can write.  See ubottu (feel free to ask me if you're not sure what to do after reading what he sends you):
2008-12-03T04:40:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	did you get a new prompt?  It's probably still moving
2008-12-03T04:41:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	no, it moves by its self, i dont see a percentage thing or anything just the flashing _?
2008-12-03T04:42:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	what do you mean "it moves by itself"?  mv has no progress bar.  Do you get a new prompt "linuxnoob@ubuntu$ " or whatever
2008-12-03T04:42:00.000Z	jrib	Linuxnoob100	then it's still moving.  How big is the file?
2008-12-03T04:43:00.000Z	Linuxnoob100	jrib	i meant like; is it moving if i dont see anything and i cant type into the prompt? but you answered my questoion by saying there is no progress bar; thanks :D
