2008-11-01T15:02:00.000Z	bazhang	cpro	open a terminal and type top; what is eating much of your cpu
2008-11-01T15:03:00.000Z	cpro	bazhang	firefox 21 %
2008-11-01T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	cpro	do you have many plugins for firefox
2008-11-01T15:05:00.000Z	cpro	bazhang	i have 10 plugins
2008-11-01T15:06:00.000Z	bazhang	cpro	try to disable them one by one until you hit the problem one; some of them are huge memory hogs
2008-11-01T15:06:00.000Z	cpro	bazhang	ok
2008-11-01T15:06:00.000Z	bazhang	cpro	I use adblock plus, flashblock, and quick locale switcher only and firefox is very fast for the same system as yours
