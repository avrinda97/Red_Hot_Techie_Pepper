2004-10-13T14:34:00.000Z	joem	clee	 cef, thank you
2004-10-17T06:35:00.000Z	joem	clee	libglade?
2004-10-17T06:37:00.000Z	clee	joem	Glade as a UI designer is *sorely* lacking though
2004-10-17T06:39:00.000Z	clee	joem	I don't claim to have *intimate* knowledge of GTK, but I have learned enough about it to feel pretty comfortable with it. I've written a couple of small test apps, and read through a *lot* of the API documentation
2004-10-17T06:40:00.000Z	clee	joem	I know Qt quite a bit better, obviously
2004-10-17T06:40:00.000Z	clee	joem	but a lot of the things that I take for granted with Qt/KDE just don't exist with GTK
2004-10-17T06:41:00.000Z	clee	joem	it's not even "more complicated"
2004-10-17T06:41:00.000Z	clee	joem	it's "oh. that doesn't exist."
2004-10-17T06:42:00.000Z	clee	joem	for example - you can't add or remove columns from a GtkTreeView from glade. Simply doesn't work.
2004-10-17T06:42:00.000Z	joem	clee	well thats no fun then
2004-10-17T06:42:00.000Z	clee	joem	exactly.
2004-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	joem	clee	yea
2004-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	clee	joem	I know, that was what triggered that little outburst. :)
2004-10-17T06:45:00.000Z	clee	joem	check out http://people.redhat.com/mclasen/higdialog/comparison.html for another example of what I'm talking about. :)
2004-10-17T06:46:00.000Z	joem	clee	yea that is crazy
2004-10-19T11:03:00.000Z	joem	clee	he wants to be you
2004-10-19T11:03:00.000Z	clee	joem	Well, duh, dude.
2004-10-19T11:24:00.000Z	joem	clee	put that description on the wiki front page
2004-10-19T11:24:00.000Z	clee	joem	heh.
2004-10-19T11:24:00.000Z	clee	joem	probably a little too vulgar for "front page" material :)
2004-10-19T11:28:00.000Z	clee	joem	heh. exactly.
2004-10-19T11:28:00.000Z	clee	joem	or another conversation, where walters and clarkbw were arguing about something
2004-10-19T11:42:00.000Z	joem	clee	shh
2004-10-19T11:46:00.000Z	joem	clee	stop spreading your dirty anti-gnome propagandha
