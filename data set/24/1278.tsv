2010-05-28T13:12:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 thats a setting in BIOS
2010-05-28T13:12:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	But what happens if I do, if and when I want into BIOS later on, how?
2010-05-28T13:13:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	you mean skipping BIOS' POST?
2010-05-28T13:13:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Yes
2010-05-28T13:13:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 no you cant do that
2010-05-28T13:13:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	no BIOS lets you turn that off
2010-05-28T13:13:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Would be cool, I took time on my SSD drive, the BIOS logo and POST process take like 20 seconds and *buntu boots under 5 seconds
2010-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	So it take like 30 seconds anyway
2010-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 its not safe to disable POST
2010-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Probably not ... Will it go faster if I buy a better motherboard? :D
2010-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 dunno, what do you have in there now?
2010-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	A Asus Maximus Formula
2010-05-28T13:16:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	i dont know what would increase boot time, the lag might be because its testing all components on the system, but IDK
2010-05-28T13:16:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	I only use SATA units, one simple nvidia 7950 GT, 4 Corsair RAM 800 Mhz RAM
2010-05-28T13:16:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	I think its the only components affecting POST process
2010-05-28T13:17:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Then I did memorytest86+ before and got some errors on my RAM sticks, could be that?
2010-05-28T13:18:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 could be
2010-05-28T13:18:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Do you know if its possible to fix erros on RAM someway in Ubuntu?
2010-05-28T13:19:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	I have lifetime warranty on them so no prob, but would like to not send them in.
2010-05-28T13:21:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 go to Corsair
2010-05-28T13:21:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 if its a lifetime warranty, corsair will fix it
2010-05-28T13:21:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	Then I have to pay for the freaking shipping and all, right? :S
2010-05-28T13:21:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	oxymoron	 AFAIK, contact Corsair support first to figure it out
2010-05-28T13:22:00.000Z	oxymoron	CaptainTrek	But I am thinking of MAYBE buy new MB, CPU and RAM, but rather not if I dont need to because I have already throw away a lot of money lately on my freaking computer I dont want to sit on anyway
