2011-12-10T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	does the interface have a default gateway set?

2011-12-10T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	thats the loopback, if you run:  ifconfig     do you see an IP for eth0|wlan0|ra0 ?

2011-12-10T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	yes, we need the product line
2011-12-10T19:30:00.000Z	rhinos	ActionParsnip	http://paste.ubuntu.com/765914/  soz man, takes a while to type it in
2011-12-10T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	there is no product line listed there, all you need to do is search for the product line in the output to find guides
2011-12-10T19:44:00.000Z	rhinos	ActionParsnip	mmmh, not really sure how that helps, going to stick a wireless card in. not sure why i get *-network DISABLED could be why nothing works
2011-12-10T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	if it's usb based then run:  lsusb   and use the 8 character hex ID to find guides
2011-12-10T19:47:00.000Z	rhinos	ActionParsnip	should i just buy a new network card?
2011-12-10T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rhinos	up to you
