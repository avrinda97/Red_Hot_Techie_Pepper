2008-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	try this one --> locate google | grep bin
2008-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	that should give you a list of google earth's installed locations
2008-03-31T15:52:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	remove the offending key in .ssh/known_hosts
2008-03-31T15:53:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	you can do that, though it'll ask you every time you connect to a host if you want to add it. It's the easiest way though
2008-03-31T15:55:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	hmm nice :)
2008-03-31T15:57:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	normally it tries to auth you as your own user. If you do remoteusername@remoteip you'll be good
2008-03-31T15:57:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	remember though: use the remote info
2008-03-31T15:58:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	perfect :) it worked! thank u
2008-03-31T15:58:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	you're welcome
2008-03-31T16:20:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	no i never had a problem with it. I use vbox for school when i have to use windows apps
2008-03-31T16:21:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	can you be more specific? perhaps i'm able to recreate those restarts you're having
2008-03-31T16:24:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	ok... in ubuntu i had opened a terminal + a pdf file.  in my vm (win xp pro) i opened borland c++ compiler (we use this at uni) and i was looking in the pdf (where i would see what I need to do in excercise i was workin on) and then i would go back to my vm and to borland compiler and writing my code... at some points the vm would just restart (in the first screen of virtual box BEFORE booting the vm it said that the vm
2008-03-31T16:26:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	sounds odd ... i don't have borland though .. you using gutsy or hardy?
2008-03-31T16:27:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	never had such a problem myself .... yet i'm using hardy though, might be the reason why
2008-03-31T16:27:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	yeah i know it's odd... it happened several times.... sometimes i hadnt even saved my project and i had to do everything all over again :(
2008-03-31T16:28:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	hit the save shortcut before unfocussing your vm?
2008-03-31T16:28:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	to help out in the reboots .. try running it from command line and see if it gives an error, alongside check dmesg
2008-03-31T16:29:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	or even better hit the save button every 5 secs :P   hmm I always run it from terminal (sudo VirtualBox)  otherwise it has some problem with the hard disk
2008-03-31T16:30:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	i dunno ... i leave it at default and have no trouble with it .. perhaps hw limits?
2008-03-31T16:30:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	also, why run it as root? for me works fine as user
2008-03-31T16:41:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	sorry for the delay... I dont know why it needs root priviledges... i would get an error for accessing the hard drive and the vm wouldnt start.... So through vm you cannot run programs like autocad that require higher video memory  ?!!?!? (that would be a disaster :( )
2008-03-31T16:42:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	direct rendering is not possible AFAIK ...
2008-03-31T16:42:00.000Z	hischild	differentreality	does your normal user have read and write permissions on the HD?
2008-03-31T16:42:00.000Z	differentreality	hischild	i guess
