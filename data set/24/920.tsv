2010-10-28T19:25:00.000Z	lee_		Hey guys. Wondering if anyone can help, i just installed Teamspeak 3 (im a total noob btw) but everytime i run the command sh ts3client.sh X restarts?
2010-10-28T19:27:00.000Z	lee_		I donâ€™t understand why launching Teamspeak 3 would cause X to restart every time. any suggestions?
2010-10-28T19:29:00.000Z	lee_		im guessing nobody knows then :P
2010-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	you could run it as > sh teamspeak.sh &>textfile
2010-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	im not sure i follow, i double clicked it it restarted X so i ran the file from terminal. and again it restarted X but it seemed to install fine.
2010-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	so you've ran that script to install teamspeak
2010-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	yes mate. downloaded it from ts website. and ran the runscript.sh (after the installer gave me a new folder) and it restarts X i run ts3client and same thing.
2010-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	you could try installing it through synaptic
2010-10-28T19:35:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	only teamspeak 2 is on synaptic as far as i know.
2010-10-28T19:36:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	and i need ts3 as thats what the server is running im attempting to connect to.
2010-10-28T19:37:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	 let me heck the installer
2010-10-28T19:38:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	ok what do you need me to do ? remember i litterly installed ubuntu last night. got sick of windows 7
2010-10-28T19:39:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	sorry i got Disconected
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	i am trying to install ts3
2010-10-28T19:41:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	ahh ok thank you
2010-10-28T19:46:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	i've installed teamspeak just now
2010-10-28T19:46:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	then what the hell have i done wrong.
2010-10-28T19:46:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	do sudo ./setup.sh
2010-10-28T19:49:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	how do i delete a directory that requres root priv?
2010-10-28T19:49:00.000Z	n3rV3	lee_	you have to be carefull with that
2010-10-28T19:50:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	yeah but to exract the file i can't use sudo. or it fails so first command would be sh Teamspeak3-client*.run
2010-10-28T19:51:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	or am i wrong.
2010-10-28T19:52:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	setup.sh isn't there
2010-10-28T20:04:00.000Z	lee_	n3rV3	whenever i run ts3client_runscript.sh Ts3 loads but as soon as i get the gui up X restarts that is my issue. teamspeak seems to be installed as it will load it just reboots X every time i launch it.
