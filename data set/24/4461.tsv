2008-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	pyrak		ftp client
2008-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	pyrak		from console
2008-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	man ftp
2008-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	pyrak		i want to see how many permissions my user has
2008-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	tried, couldn't find it
2008-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	couldn't fine what?
2008-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	looking for how many permissions my user has
2008-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	"how many permissions"...?  doesn't make sense
2008-01-11T09:00:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	if i have read/write or just read, etc
2008-01-11T09:00:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	depends on what ftp server you connect to
2008-01-11T09:00:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	i realize.  i'm looking on a particular server
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	pyrak		a client was supposed to give me permissions to edit files, but i'm having trouble through nautilus
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	pyrak		so i thought i'd try one more approach before blaming them
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	you don't use Nautilus to do file managing over FTP....
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	you can.
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	lol, ok whatever
2008-01-11T09:01:00.000Z	danc3		good luck
2008-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	what do you recommend?
2008-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	I recommend you use a GUI FTP client
2008-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	which one?
2008-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	like gFTP
2008-01-11T09:05:00.000Z	danc3	pyrak	did you try gftp?
2008-01-11T09:06:00.000Z	pyrak	danc3	yeah.  still playing with it...
