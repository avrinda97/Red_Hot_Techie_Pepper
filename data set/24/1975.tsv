2011-01-09T09:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	I guess the worst thing is that every time you update-grub or install a new kernel all your changes made there will be lost
2011-01-09T09:22:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	if that's the worst thing that would happen, I don't see what's so bad about it
2011-01-09T09:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	I could be wrong there,  but you can just setup a 40_custom with what you want and it will always be there
2011-01-09T09:23:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	all I'm doing is commenting out a few entries
2011-01-09T09:23:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	actually that's a good idea --- would I then disable the os_prober script
2011-01-09T09:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	everything else stays the same just copy and paiste what you want in it and edit it then update-grub and a new menu item will be added with your 40_custom settings
2011-01-09T09:25:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	ok, the thing is I'd like fewer entries, not more, so I'm not sure how to do that
2011-01-09T09:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	oh ok got ya,  well for that you need to remove all the bootable enties that it finds like rename them or remove them the update-grub and they should all be gone
2011-01-09T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	like unistall the kernels that you now have from synaptic
2011-01-09T09:27:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	so if I understand right, edit grub.cfg, then run update-grub?
2011-01-09T09:27:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	i've done that step :) I've got three instances of windows in grub, but I only need one
2011-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	there is no need to edit grub.cfg at all just remove the kernels you don't want and update-grub,  grub does the editing for you
2011-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	do the window partitions still exist?
2011-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	yes, it's windows 7, so one is the main partition, one is a small recovery partition (I think) and one is a partition called "HP_TOOLS"
2011-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	if you never want to boot the windows partitions that exist then just delete them (the windows partitions) then run update-grub and the etries will be gone
2011-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	well I'd like to be able to access them from the windows bootloader
2011-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	well try your config edit then
2011-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	ok, I'll try
2011-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	just backup what you change you can always do a live boot and fix it and all hell breaks
2011-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	was that the editing grub.cfg, or copying everything into 40_custom and stopping os_prober
2011-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	no the 40_custom would only add entries you would have to edit the grub.cfg file
2011-01-09T09:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	good luck
2011-03-21T21:43:00.000Z	sacarlson	semitones	plop should enable your system to boot a usb flash even without your bios support
2011-03-21T21:44:00.000Z	semitones	sacarlson	because when I tried I got a bunch of I/O errors before the login screen, and couldn't login. The same pendrive booted up on another pc
