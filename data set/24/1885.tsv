2009-07-09T22:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flasbang73	what's wrong with Pidgin anyway?   In fact originaly that was meant to be an alternative to AIM,  and then later  networks  came later.   Also  it used to be called Gaim  which I assume stood for  GTK AOL Instnat Messenger,  AOL didn't like the name and sued over it,  which  stopped development for a while untill the name change.
2009-07-09T22:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flasbang73	above that was   support for other networks came later on
2009-07-09T22:49:00.000Z	flasbang73	sebsebseb	ya but pidgin doesn't have all the feature that i like for the real aim
2009-07-09T22:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flasbang73	such as?
2009-07-09T22:50:00.000Z	flasbang73	sebsebseb	i like the special chats and customized sounds
2009-07-09T22:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flasbang73	well pretty sure the  version for Linux is old,  so  fine  Wine it
2009-07-09T22:51:00.000Z	flasbang73	sebsebseb	ok thanks anyway thats what i was going to do if i couldn't find one
