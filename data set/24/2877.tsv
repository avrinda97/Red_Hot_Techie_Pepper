2009-01-06T22:24:00.000Z	churl		would this be the place to get a "how to" question answered on mounting a kodak easyshare (haha) camera? xubuntu 8.10
2009-01-06T22:25:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	does it connect through USB?
2009-01-06T22:27:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	yes sir!
2009-01-06T22:28:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	normally such things auto detect try to make sure the camera is in the appropriate mode and it should hopefully show up as USB mass storage
2009-01-06T22:30:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	appropriate mode: lsusb shows the camera.  "show up as a usb mass store div" ill play dumb and you tell me where i should look :)
2009-01-06T22:34:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	normally it just automounts, similar to plugging a USB flash drive into the computer
2009-01-06T22:35:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	yeah, youd find it on the side in thundar right
2009-01-06T22:35:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	you have to be careful about some cameras because some will show up as USB mass storage (aka flash drive) or Webcam depending on the mode selected on the back of the camera. You don't want it in webcam mode
2009-01-06T22:38:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	i see a NTSC and PAL under setup on the cam,
2009-01-06T22:40:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	that shouldn't matter too much...
2009-01-06T22:41:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	kodak c763
2009-01-06T22:43:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	found a post that that camera doesn't like being mounted normally by any OS... but there are some possible work arounds
2009-01-06T22:44:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	i probably have already been looking at that, there arnt many sites up for that model
2009-01-06T22:45:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	did you try gphot2 & gtkam?
2009-01-06T22:45:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	seems like the best bet it to xfer all of the files to an sd card, and put the sd card in a reader
2009-01-06T22:46:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	i tried gtkam
2009-01-06T22:47:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	it seems from reading some posts that the best you'll be able to do is access the internal memory, anything on a card will be inaccessible since it doesn't show up as mass storage. I suggest getting a card reader.
2009-01-06T22:48:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	thanks for the help
2009-01-06T22:49:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	sorry I can't be of more assistance. seems like a hassle to have to go through all that to use the camera...
2009-01-06T22:50:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	i know!  i used to use an old laptop with tinyxp for my camera but the roof leaked water on it, (only paid $15) for it,
2009-01-06T22:52:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	well if you still have a laptop or other access to cardreader, you can probably force the camera to only write to the card... so then you just pop the card out of the camera and into the card reader
2009-01-06T22:54:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	i can always use one of the other computers lying around the house haha i just wanted it to work on here.  i want to believe i had it working at one point on an older version of ubuntu
2009-01-06T22:56:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	churl	just because something works on an older version of ubuntu doesn't mean it'll work on the current version ( I have a that had no sound in 8.04 but was fine previously... 8.10 was fine until first patch and sound disappeared again).
2009-01-06T22:56:00.000Z	churl	nibsa1242b	yeah, back in the day when i could see nm-applet in my panel!!
