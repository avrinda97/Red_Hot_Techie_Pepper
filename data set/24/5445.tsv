2006-07-10T11:21:00.000Z	ndookie	devhen	: so , im looking for a program that i can use to search for wireless networks
2006-07-10T11:21:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	hmm. sorry. dont know if i can help. in the past i have found several programs on the web for configuring wireless networks maybe try one of them
2006-07-10T11:21:00.000Z	ndookie	devhen	: you know the name of any ?
2006-07-10T11:21:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	sry dont have a URL off the top of my head. do a google for linux wireless
2006-07-10T11:22:00.000Z	ndookie	devhen	: thanks
2006-07-10T11:22:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	one is NetworkManager
2006-07-10T11:22:00.000Z	ndookie		ok , i'll google it
2006-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	i think NetworkManager is installed by default (could be wrong) check to see if its running in 'services'
2006-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	ndookie	devhen	: http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/
2006-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	sudo system-config-services see if NetworkManager is listed at the top and see if its running/set to run at startup
2006-07-10T11:24:00.000Z	ndookie		i dont think its installed
2006-07-10T11:24:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	if not, sudo apt-get install NetworkManager should install it
2006-07-10T11:24:00.000Z	ndookie		i'll have to take all this down , because im on windows right now
2006-07-10T11:24:00.000Z	devhen	ndookie	yeah, im on fedora so i cant check to make sure im right :/
2006-07-10T11:24:00.000Z	ndookie		oh ok
2006-07-10T11:25:00.000Z	ndookie		i'll download the tarball too
2006-07-10T11:25:00.000Z	ndookie		just incase
2006-07-10T11:25:00.000Z	ndookie		but remember , no internet access on the computer either
2006-07-10T11:25:00.000Z	ndookie		>_>
