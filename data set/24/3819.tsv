2007-10-03T15:22:00.000Z	slimjimflim		hi. i just reinstalled my nvidia geforce4 legacy driver on feisty fawn, and now, after being down for a few days, x gives me the x windows log in, but fails to actually load my desktop.  what can i do to fix this?
2007-10-03T15:23:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	you are sure this has something to do with the nvidia driver? looks more like a problem loading your gnome session
2007-10-03T15:29:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	yea, i think it's gnome, otherwise i wouldn't get any giu
2007-10-03T15:30:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	try to log in on a text console (ctrl-alt-f1) and check the file .xsession-errors
2007-10-03T15:31:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	yea. there's an error, i'll pastebin it
2007-10-03T15:33:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	http://pastebin.ca/724084
2007-10-03T15:34:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	is that the complete file?
2007-10-03T15:34:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	no, i left out the begining
2007-10-03T15:35:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	looks like the shell doesn't like the syntax in one of the session scripts
2007-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	is this a clean install of feisty?
2007-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	maybe
2007-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	i don't use gnome here, so i can't tell exactly
2007-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	i don't use kde either
2007-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	i am running xfce here
2007-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	could i use that?
2007-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	but i do have that /etc/gdm/Xsession here
2007-10-03T15:39:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	md5sum of my /etc/gdm/Xsession is: 60f055534fa6b3a1497c92fabbfd8f63
2007-10-03T15:40:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	i don't think that's it, there's no opening parenthese before line 12 anyway
2007-10-03T15:41:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	right, line 12 is a comment
2007-10-03T15:42:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	another reason for not starting X session could be no space left on the filesystem
2007-10-03T15:43:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	check with  df -h
2007-10-03T15:43:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	hmm
2007-10-03T16:10:00.000Z	slimjimflim	tthh00	i'm installing kde
2007-10-03T16:11:00.000Z	tthh00	slimjimflim	before installing such a beast, try with fluxbox or something
