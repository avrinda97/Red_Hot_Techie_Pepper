2011-12-27T12:40:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Which Ubuntu distro?
2011-12-27T12:42:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	System >> Preferences >> Monitors.
2011-12-27T12:45:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Can your screen ratio handle 1024 by 600?
2011-12-27T12:46:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	By the way depending on your video card you may need binary drivers installed.
2011-12-27T12:47:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Or an open source driver.
2011-12-27T12:48:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Is the other computer running on Ubuntu or another operating system?
2011-12-27T12:49:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	If you're using Ubuntu 11.10 it may install the open source ati/nvidia driver. If you're using anything below that such as 10.04 LTS it may use a generic driver. Showing outputs of 800x600 and 640x480.
2011-12-27T12:50:00.000Z	debaino	aBound	Can anything be done in UBuntu LTs i am using to fix the issue?
2011-12-27T12:52:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	If you're using Ubuntu LTS on all computers and only a few work. One of them definitely is either using onboard video or an actual video card. I'd check what kind of onboard video/video card it uses through a terminal. By opening a terminal type: lspci
2011-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Ubuntu 11.10 will hav
2011-12-27T12:57:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Ubuntu 11.10 will have a newer kernel once you update the system but at the moment it tends to be somewhat unstable. It varies given that once you install the system and if you have an ati/nvidia card it will ask you to install the restricted binary drivers.
2011-12-27T12:58:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	By default it may use one of the open source drivers.
2011-12-27T13:01:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	I meant unstable as in the mouse acting weird and unity.
2011-12-27T13:02:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Ubuntu 11.10 is more bleeding edge.
2011-12-27T13:02:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Figures if you upgrade the others it'll automatically switch to an open source driver if you use ati/nvidia cards.
2011-12-27T13:02:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	I'm using 12.04 LTS Alpha 1.
2011-12-27T13:04:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	12.04 LTS Alpha 1 is somewhat a bit stable but unstable when it comes to open Software Center and possibly your home folder.
2011-12-27T13:05:00.000Z	debaino	aBound	Thanks for your insights,really helpful.
2012-01-26T14:00:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	It's like for example trying to install Win7 onto 256MB will more or less put the system to a crawl.
2012-01-26T14:03:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	You could try Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
2012-01-26T14:03:00.000Z	aBound	debaino	Or what Jordan_U implied Lubuntu.
