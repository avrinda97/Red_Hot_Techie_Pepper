2008-07-23T19:03:00.000Z	axenory		Can I reinstall Ubuntu and keep all the folders?
2008-07-23T19:03:00.000Z	axenory		I mean
2008-07-23T19:03:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	you can keep your home stuff if you have it on a separate partition easily, there's another way as well (with the alternate cd installer)
2008-07-23T19:05:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	But I didnt do anything the last time I reinstall and all my folders were there even though my programs werent... how does it happen?
2008-07-23T19:06:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	you most likely had those folders on a separate partition from the one you actually installed ubuntu onto
2008-07-23T19:06:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	or told the installer not to format the partition you installed to, and got lucky that it worked cleanly ;)
2008-07-23T19:10:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	mmm okay.... hey nick I have this compaq laptop.... I am experiencing some wireless problems with it. At the beggining it worked fine the first couple days. Now It looks like the wireless card is not getting into the internet, eventhough it reads that there is a wireless conection somewhere. (you also need to know that the drivers were obtained by the "Hardware drivers" apps, I dont know if that matters) plz help
2008-07-23T19:11:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	I've had experience with exactly one wireless card, Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 01) , and it's just worked
2008-07-23T19:12:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	but how did you manage with the problem?
2008-07-23T19:13:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	usually what I do with wireless dying is  sudo killall NetworkManager && sudo NetworkManager , my problems have been with that software
2008-07-23T19:14:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	it restarts the wireless software stack from scratch.
2008-07-23T19:15:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	 can you describe me what was your problem just to make sure we are on the same page, no offense, plz
2008-07-23T19:16:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	nothing at the kernel level. My problems have never been iwconfig not showing the card. Just the actual connection being made.
2008-07-23T19:18:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	the thing is that I dont really undeerstand what your issue was, but let me tell you again..... the wireless card worked, Now it just recognize the wireless network but when I try to connect it tryes and always fails...
2008-07-23T19:18:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	so you can see the applet in the panel attempting, but failing/
2008-07-23T19:18:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	failing to connect, that is
2008-07-23T19:19:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	I've got to get ready for work shortly, so don't have a lot of time
2008-07-23T19:20:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	my first troubleshooting step would be    tail -f /var/log/messages   in a terminal, then try the connection again. You will see some messages about the connection attempt, you may see some clues
2008-07-23T19:21:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	thanks! both of you then go to work! hehehe thanks very much
2008-07-23T19:21:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	but it seems that Muntrue knows more about wireless than I do. Like I said, I have minimal experience with one card
2008-08-01T18:52:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	first, try playing a different mp3.
2008-08-01T18:53:00.000Z	axenory	nickrud	I have already
2008-08-01T18:53:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	never hurts to ask, you'd be suprised (or not) at how many people don't
2008-08-01T18:54:00.000Z	nickrud	axenory	what are you trying to play it with?
