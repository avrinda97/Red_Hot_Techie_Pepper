2008-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	ok it is likely that there is not linux driver for your card,  so you will have to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper,   that,s mentionned in the wifi docs
2008-04-26T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	lspci should list your card,  get the number and such,  ndiswrapper you can install from synaptic,   ndiswrapper-config as well or -utils , i donT' recall,   and you'll need the .inf file ffrom the card's installation cd
2008-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	do you know your card model ?
2008-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport look in there and in the forum
2008-04-26T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	from this point on your are on your own, I don'T know anymore about wifi cards,  sorry man, you'll have to figure it out of find another helper
2008-04-27T04:07:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	is the wifi built in or card you pop in ?
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	bagelong	Pelo	 I have been abandoned and you are the man.  Can you help me.
2008-04-27T04:04:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	still on the wifi stuff ?
2008-04-27T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	did you manage to get ndiswrapper working ?
2008-04-27T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	are you sure you got the rigth driver ?
2008-04-27T04:06:00.000Z	bagelong	Pelo	 I have tried bcmwl5 which was recommended everywhere in ubuntu, and bcmwl6 which was recommended by dell for this system running vista
2008-04-27T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	got a chipset model ? goto the makers website and get the driver for XP or lower ,  vista is too new, probably not well supported by ndiswrapper
2008-04-27T04:08:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	and the xp one doesn't work either ?
2008-04-27T04:09:00.000Z	Pelo	bagelong	does your wifi card appear in lspci ?
