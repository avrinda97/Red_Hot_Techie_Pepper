2010-10-02T13:29:00.000Z	lozoot		hey can anyone help me? i just installed ubuntu and when i try to start it up i hear a sound but my screen stay black.
2010-10-02T13:31:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 that'll be something with the graphics that is causing an issue - do you know the graphics card?
2010-10-02T14:04:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 that'll be something with the graphics that is causing an issue - do you know the graphics card? - like i asked earlier...
2010-10-02T14:06:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 using the default driver?
2010-10-02T14:06:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 it never let you in after you installed?
2010-10-02T14:08:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 at the boot prompt you can press F1 and get boot options - iirc safe graphics is one of the options - does that boot?
2010-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 worth a try
2010-10-02T14:16:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	 okay when my computer starts up  and i get to the boot menu i see ubuntu  ubuntu(recovery mode  2 memory test things and xp
2010-10-02T14:17:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 sorry I was thinking of the live cd - I led you astray there
2010-10-02T14:18:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 choose the recovery option - you can read the X log from there
2010-10-02T14:20:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 that is what it does - then it gives a prompt like in the terminal - the you do   cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | less
2010-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 seems there is a major issue with that graphics card - I don't use nvidia so don't know what else to suggest - if the tty won't work...
2010-10-02T14:28:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	i've had ubuntu installed on this computer before a while ago  its was an older version of ubuntu. it worked fune  maybe i should try installing an older version then updating?
2010-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 it might be a kernel issue or something with the X driver I don't know - upgrading from an older distro will just get you to where you are now...
2010-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 in    www.google.com/linux   search for your card number and ubuntu
2010-10-02T14:33:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	i searched  "nvidia 6150 le ubuntu"  what sould i be looking for?
2010-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 a link that mentions solved or anything similar
2010-10-02T14:38:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	i dont see anything that says solved   try lookin thru the search yourself and see if anything there might help you help me
2010-10-02T14:47:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 yep - I'm too busy to do your searches for you and read lots of web pages tho
2010-10-02T14:48:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	okay, do you think that updating to the 10.10 rc would work?
2010-10-02T14:49:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 I couldn't say - I don't know where the issue is and where it needs to be fixed
2010-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	well, i cant think of another option so im gonna try.
2010-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	moetunes	lozoot	 good luck :]
2010-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	lozoot	moetunes	thank you.
