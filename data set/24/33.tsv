2012-10-21T23:32:00.000Z	Zw33t		Hi! I sould like to create users on my ubuntu server that only can access "some" folders. How to do that?
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		Chroot jail or something, heard about it?
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		above /home folder
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		etc, with chmod they can still se files, but not open
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	Zw33t		as far as i know
2012-10-21T23:34:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Thats wrong.
2012-10-21T23:36:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	when needing 777 on a bunch of files, your security concept is broken by design.
2012-10-21T23:37:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Then you dont need to mess with permissions, as everyone can read every file.
2012-10-21T23:37:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	As I said: security concept broken by design.
2012-10-21T23:37:00.000Z	Zw33t	bekks	i dont want everyone to have access to all files :P
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Then dont use 777 or 775.
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	No.
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	No.
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	By DEFAULT, files are 644.
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	Zw33t	bekks	folders are 775 *
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	No.
2012-10-21T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	By default, folders are 755.
2012-10-21T23:39:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	And 755/644 still allows everyone to read everything.
2012-10-21T23:40:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Expected behaviour.
2012-10-21T23:41:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Then first please get to know what 755 and 644 actually mean :)
2012-10-21T23:43:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	No. Dont guess, please read the link you've been given about permissions.
2012-10-21T23:44:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	...
2012-10-21T23:47:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Please read the permissions link you've been given - it explains what permissions are.
2012-10-21T23:50:00.000Z	bekks	Zw33t	Nonsense.
