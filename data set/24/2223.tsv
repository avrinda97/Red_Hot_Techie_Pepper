2009-03-03T10:09:00.000Z	Guest58224		I installed a program with "sh"  command, how do uninstall it?
2009-03-03T10:09:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	what program?
2009-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	well, all it did was copy files onto your system; so to undo it, you have to find an uninstall action in the script
2009-03-03T10:12:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	possibly; whatever_you_ran --uninstall
2009-03-03T10:14:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	 : Like this "sh ioquake3-1.34-rc3.run --uninstall" ?
2009-03-03T10:16:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	possibly
2009-03-03T10:16:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	it looks like there may be an 'uninstall.sh' somewhere
2009-03-03T10:17:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	I don't even know where to look. Should I just format the HDD drive and reinstall Ubuntu?
2009-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	I just downloaded it
2009-03-03T10:23:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	: Any luck?
2009-03-03T10:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	did you run the installer with sudo?
2009-03-03T10:24:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	: I used sudo -s
2009-03-03T10:25:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	ok, you can run sudo /usr/local/games/ioquake3/uninstall
2009-03-03T10:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	the installation doesn't look too invasive though; why did you want to uninstall it anyway?
2009-03-03T10:27:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	Couldn't get it to work - and the installation instructions on the site are only written for experienced Linux users
2009-03-03T10:27:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	Just another headache for just a simple task, I guess.
2009-03-03T10:27:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	so did you try the uninstall script?
2009-03-03T10:28:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	Didn't know there was one. Nothing told me one was available.
2009-03-03T10:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	00:25 < crdlb> Guest58224: ok, you can run sudo /usr/local/games/ioquake3/uninstall
2009-03-03T10:29:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	I did, and got this message Could not find a usable uninstall program. Aborting.
2009-03-03T10:30:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	there should only be /usr/local/games/ioquake3/ and /usr/local/bin/ioquake3
2009-03-03T10:31:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	there's no "registry" type linux thingies left behind or anything like that?
2009-03-03T10:31:00.000Z	crdlb	Guest58224	yeah nothing from an offical ubuntu package will install into /usr/local; so nothing in there is critical
2009-03-03T10:33:00.000Z	Guest58224	crdlb	How come the Linux community has the mentality that providing rudimentary information is a chore?
