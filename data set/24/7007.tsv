2005-05-25T16:24:00.000Z	xml-blog		perhaps /hdc ??? it's a shot in the dark but I only have one hard disk and it's on SCSI ...

2005-10-17T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	xml-blog	grab the correct sources.list for breezy from http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2325

2005-10-17T05:36:00.000Z	xml-blog	Seveas	looks like it's picking up where the breezy upgrade left off. asking me about replaceing xorg config, etc ;)
