2007-12-28T03:11:00.000Z	gogzmer	zarac-	I prefer compiz-fusion that comes with gutsy
2007-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	zarac-		oh.. thought only compiz came? =D
2007-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	gogzmer	zarac-	It really depends on what your needs and usage patterns are
2007-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	zarac-		i dunno... what do you use gogzmer ? =D
2007-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	zarac-		oh.. ocmpiz fusion =D
2007-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	zarac-		right ,)
2007-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	zarac-		i use it too.. it's nice =D
2007-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	zarac-		thought it only was compiz though ;)
2007-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	zarac-		what did you run before that? ... before compiz that is =D
2007-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	gogzmer	zarac-	It is -fusion because it has many of the Beryl additions in it and isn't pure compiz
2007-12-28T03:14:00.000Z	zarac-		ok =D
2007-12-28T03:14:00.000Z	zarac-		so gogzmer .. what before compiz-fusion? =D
2007-12-28T03:14:00.000Z	gogzmer	zarac-	What do you mean before?
2007-12-28T03:15:00.000Z	zarac-	gogzmer	.. what window manager before compiz-fusion? or have you only used that?
2007-12-28T03:15:00.000Z	zarac-		well i'm getting fluxbox =D
2007-12-28T03:15:00.000Z	gogzmer	zarac-	Before that, I used Metacity that comes with older Ubuntu versions. I did everything I needed, which wasn't much, so it was sufficient
