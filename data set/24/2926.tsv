2008-06-23T08:28:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	you could try disabling desktop cube, i've got the desktop wall thingy working here with send to
2008-06-23T08:29:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	disabling it gives me the send to workspace stuff, but then the cube is disabled Y__Y
2008-06-23T08:30:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	it must be you compiz config, you could try deleting it
2008-06-23T08:30:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	do you think it's in the compiz config?
2008-06-23T08:31:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	your config is probably stored in $home/.compiz
2008-06-23T08:34:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	try "mv ~/.compiz ~/compiz_backup" then restart compiz and see if you have the move window drop down
2008-06-23T08:36:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	hmm.. when I have compiz on classic mode it has the send to workspace option
2008-06-23T08:40:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	i think desktop wall is better anyhow
2008-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	I like the spinning
2008-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	do you know where the window bar config files are?
2008-06-23T08:43:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	~/.metacity?
2008-06-23T08:43:00.000Z	name_name	webjames	I'll look there, thanks
2008-06-23T08:44:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	it could be ~/.emerald if you use that
2008-06-23T08:46:00.000Z	webjames	name_name	alt+f2 gksudo nautilus
