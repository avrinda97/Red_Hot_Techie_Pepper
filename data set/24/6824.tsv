2006-03-03T17:57:00.000Z	ailean		thanks funkyHat
2006-03-03T12:00:00.000Z	ailean		How is linux for writing to NTFS file systems these days?
2006-03-03T12:01:00.000Z	ailean		yeah, i remember reading that it was terrible, but i was hearing that it's getting to be good now - is that wrong information? :)
2006-03-03T12:01:00.000Z	ailean		in what way p0windah?
2006-03-03T12:02:00.000Z	ailean		i got ltools for windows, which is great to write from that side, but i can't do it the other way . . . hmm
2006-03-03T12:03:00.000Z	ailean		i see
2006-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	ltools, that do read and write to ext2/3 fs from windows?
2006-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	ailean	biovore	i thought so, but now that you mention it, i have only read from ext2/3
2006-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	take a look for ext2fsd
2006-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	biovore		makes it a native drive in windows
2006-03-03T12:04:00.000Z	ailean	biovore	k
2006-03-03T12:05:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	It can mount a linux ext2 or ext3 partion to a drive leter and supports most of the windows file access methods
2006-03-03T12:06:00.000Z	ailean		that looks excellent biovore - i didn't know such a thing existed
2006-03-03T12:06:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	it works ok..  you kinda have to hack at it though..
2006-03-03T12:06:00.000Z	ailean		how so?
2006-03-03T12:06:00.000Z	biovore		you have to use a text terminal to mount your device
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	and some file methods arn't supported
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	ailean	biovore	each and every time you want to access it?
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	when you boot the box
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	biovore		like unix mount
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	biovore		and umount
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	ailean	biovore	but you could put that in Startup
2006-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	biovore	ailean	maybe.. you might be able to make it a batch script
