2007-12-11T21:36:00.000Z	verb3k		I have a problem ...I installed ubuntu-restricted-extras with flash-plugin but firefox says it's not installed !?   but when I try to install it it says already installed
2007-12-11T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	the flash package is currently broke. Expect a fix shortly
2007-12-11T21:38:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	thanks  , is there another way in the mean time ?
2007-12-11T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	you can manually install it, as long as you keep track of it to remove it and use the official package later once it is fixed
2007-12-11T21:39:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	thanks
2008-01-28T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	firefox and wall paper ?
2008-01-28T19:04:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	sorry?
2008-01-28T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	firefox and wallpaper files ?
2008-01-28T19:05:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	what do you mean, I don't really understand your question
2008-01-28T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	you passwd a comment about putting an image in the home dir so that firefox couldn't overwrite it
2008-01-28T19:05:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	yes
2008-01-28T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	I missed part of the question I'd be interested in understanding what you where saying
2008-01-28T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	it looked like you where saying firefox would overwrite an image file as wallpaper ?
2008-01-28T19:08:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	ok, the guy was asking about a way to prevent people from changing the wallpaper, and he removed the permissions of gnome-appearance-properties, but users can still change wallpapers through firefox, so making a file in the home directory as described and taking the write permissions from it should prevent firefox from changing the wallpaper, hope you get it now
2008-01-28T19:10:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	what do you think :)
2008-01-28T19:10:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	just remove permissions to the wallpaper dir
2008-01-28T19:11:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	where is that?
2008-01-28T19:12:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	do you know where the wallpapers dir is?
2008-01-28T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	normally a users home dir, you could also use pam or selinux to restrict it, or lock down the .gnome dir on their home dir
2010-08-07T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	there isn't one
2010-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	previously they were listed in fstab but now they're no more. Is there a way to get their names? (not necessarily a text file)
2010-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	what do you mean "names" ?
2010-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	verb3k	ikonia	"/dev/sr0"
2010-08-07T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	verb3k	they are symlinked to /dev/cdrom and /dev/dvd
