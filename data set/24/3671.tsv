2008-12-06T11:08:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	xD
2008-12-06T11:09:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Not newer ones.
2008-12-06T11:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 I sure see a lot of people in here asking about them.. :)
2008-12-06T11:10:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Actually, newer ati-cards have better support then nVidia have.
2008-12-06T11:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 or so i  'hear' but i still see lots of people with issues with ati.. but then again. I dont even know what cards are 'newer' any more.
2008-12-06T11:11:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	I'd say cards from the HD-series are 'newer' cards.
2008-12-06T11:11:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Nope, it does not.
2008-12-06T11:21:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	gcc4? qt4? really?
2008-12-06T11:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 i noticed that also.. theres 5 differetn versions..  that just happened to be one i selected the link on... Not tried it
2008-12-06T11:22:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Should be a qt3 gcc3 version. O.o
2008-12-06T11:32:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Do know that fluxbox requires alot of configuring before it's really usable.
2008-12-06T11:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 try it and see..  deends on how you define 'useable' i guess.. it does the jobs a window-manager does...
2008-12-06T11:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 i normally just cuseomize the menus to include the terminal and a few apps i use.. i dont need the fkuxbox menu to show 1000000 items. :)
2008-12-06T11:34:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	I have, multiple times. :-)
2008-12-06T11:34:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	True, but still, the keybindings is the heart of *box, you _need_ those. :-D
2008-12-06T11:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 cant say that i ever bothered eith the fluxbox keybindings
2008-12-06T11:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 for a light WM i tend to use jwm
2008-12-06T11:35:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	I'm currently on wmii, love it. Everything is configured just the way i want it at start.
2008-12-06T11:42:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	Haha, that would be fun really. I have to try that.
2008-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	zhaozhou	 that wont do much good if gyachi is not in the repos to begin with. :)
2008-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	zhaozhou	dr_willis	True.
