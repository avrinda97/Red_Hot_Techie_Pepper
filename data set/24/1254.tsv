2011-09-24T10:59:00.000Z	Petskull		that 65000 is millisecs, right?
2011-09-24T10:59:00.000Z	Petskull		gotcha- should just man sleep before asking
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Petskull		yeah, I read up in the apt forcing
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Petskull		no?
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Petskull		why not?
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Petskull		um... no
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Petskull		that would be bad
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Petskull		no- I just need to bypass the confirmation as I won't be here
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Petskull		how would I do that?
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Petskull		it's gonna ask me..
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Loshki	Petskull	instead of forcing yes, how about using -d instead to do the download unattended, then do the actual install when you're there later....
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Petskull		ok, gonna try it with just -y
2011-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	Petskull		hey- that's not a bad idea
2011-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	Petskull		except the install is pretty lengthy on its own
2011-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	Petskull		yeah, that makes senc
2011-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	Petskull		e
2011-09-24T11:09:00.000Z	Petskull		ok, my line is this:   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras vlc mplayer mencoder build-essential xchat frozen-bubble banshee libxine1-ffmpeg xchat-gnome wine openarena stellarium celestia blender bootchart sysv-rc-conf compizconfig-settings-manager emerald barrage hedgewars chromium pacman pingus warzone2100 snes9x-gtk transmission code-blocks geany libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev ubuntu-tweak
2011-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	Petskull		hey- what's the name of the ubuntu-tweak package?
2011-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	Petskull		did it change?
2011-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	Petskull		oh... I know what happened
2011-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	Petskull		I added it, but I didn't update my cache
2011-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	Loshki	Petskull	you forgot the -y ....
2011-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	Petskull		"Need to get 822 MB of archives."... Jeez, that's gonna take days..
2011-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	Petskull	Loshki	I know, I just wanted to make sure all the packages were good
