2006-06-01T05:27:00.000Z	neutrinomass		Is Xubuntu not officially supported :-/ ?
2006-06-01T05:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	it is now
2006-06-01T05:27:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Yeah n/m, the page I was reading was outdated ...
2006-06-01T10:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	it wasn't
2006-06-01T10:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	not the exact distinction, since butgtracker for universe/multiverse is launchpad too
2006-06-01T10:59:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Yeah, you're right. I couldn't think of something better ghough
2006-06-01T11:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	things in MAIN are supported officially
2006-06-11T09:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	if you're an expert, you know how to set it up :P
2006-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Then I guess that if you're an expert you should also be able to figure out the deps for 1000 packages for yourself, and install them in the correct order, right ? :-p
2006-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	it's not even remotely similar
2006-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	setting up sudo takes seconds if you know what you're doing.
2006-06-11T09:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Agreed. The expert mode is only in ubiquity? I can't recall such a mode in the text-based installer .... (maybe I missed it )
2006-06-11T09:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	only in the alternate CD
2006-06-17T08:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	it's in java-package
2006-06-17T08:49:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Oh, thanks.
2006-06-17T08:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	you have to enable multiverse , not just universe :P
2006-06-17T08:50:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	I know, but I'm not sure if theres a !multiverse factoid - the universe one has info on the multiverse repo though.
2006-06-17T08:51:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Apparently, no !multiverse factoid exists :)
2006-06-17T08:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	!repositories is good, they mgiht link to the same thing in fact.
2006-06-17T08:52:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Again, no !repositories exists :P
2006-06-17T08:52:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Didn't work in PM :-/
2006-06-17T08:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	mispelling?
2006-06-17T08:53:00.000Z	neutrinomass	apokryphos	Sort of. I pmed ubotu with "!repositories", instead of "repositories". Anyway, that's settled now :)
2006-06-17T08:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	neutrinomass	gets me sometimes too 8)
