2010-12-16T14:32:00.000Z	mikeplus64		Anyone here use a Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch ( Wacom CTH-460 ) ? I'm wondering if it works under Linux [ and if it's worth buying? ]
2010-12-16T14:33:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 it works, but it takes a bit of configuration
2010-12-16T14:33:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 there's guides to make it work on ubuntuforums.org: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1515562&highlight=wacom
2010-12-16T14:34:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 whoops, i forgot to remove the &highlight part of that link
2010-12-16T14:35:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	I don't run ubuntu ( I run arch, I just thought that seeing that there are so many people here someone must know about wacom bamboo pen & touches ), but thanks, most of that will probably be relevant here unless it works out of the box.
2010-12-16T14:35:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 it wont work out of the box, trust me.  you should ask in the arch support channels then
2010-12-16T14:35:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 or try ##linux
2010-12-16T14:36:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 because you need to do configuration long before it works
2010-12-16T14:36:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 it took me 3 hours to make it work, but i was looking at system fialures anyways.
2010-12-16T14:36:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix		failures*
2010-12-16T14:36:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	alright
2010-12-16T14:36:00.000Z	mikeplus64		I just thought after seeing https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=109198 just then that it might
2010-12-16T14:37:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 *shrugs* the drivers dont come with any version of linux out-of-the-box
2010-12-16T14:37:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 it usually needs configuration, or installation
2010-12-16T14:38:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 i think though you should ask in the linux support channel for arch if you run into issues.
2010-12-16T14:38:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	yarp, just wanted to see if people had it working at all
2010-12-16T14:38:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 i did 2 kernel versions ago, before my drive became fubar
2010-12-16T14:38:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	Is it worth getting the pen & touch or just the pen only model?
2010-12-16T14:39:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 i have the pen only version.  they're equally decent
2010-12-16T14:39:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	alright.
2010-12-16T14:39:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 i prefer the pen version somewhat, but to each their own
2010-12-16T14:39:00.000Z	mikeplus64	EvilPhoenix	yeah. I was just thinking that the touch part of it might be useful for things other than just drawing.
2010-12-16T14:40:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 true, but i use the pen for standard navigation with a mouse too ;P
2010-12-16T14:40:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	mikeplus64	 but again, whichever you want, there's configuration needed anyways
