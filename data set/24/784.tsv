2011-01-19T02:25:00.000Z	drpi		anyone help please?
2011-01-19T02:27:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	have you looked to see if there are errors in /var/log/messages?
2011-01-19T02:27:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	when you insert the dvd?
2011-01-19T02:27:00.000Z	drpi		mbeirerl: yes
2011-01-19T02:28:00.000Z	drpi		mberierl: my dvd drive works in windows, but not ubuntu
2011-01-19T02:30:00.000Z	drpi		mbeirerl: so basically the only error message I'm getting when trying to mount my "sr0 device" is that it's unknown
2011-01-19T02:31:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	is this a removable device or built in?
2011-01-19T02:31:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	built in
2011-01-19T02:31:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	also, do you have a link /dev/dvd or /dev/cdrom ?
2011-01-19T02:32:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	link?
2011-01-19T02:32:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	"symbolic link"  do an "ls -al /dev/cdrom" and it should show something like /dev/cdrom -> sr0
2011-01-19T02:33:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	also, can you from a terminal do "dmesg | grep -i DVD"
2011-01-19T02:34:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2011-01-18 13:29 /dev/cdrom -> sr0
2011-01-19T02:34:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	and what exactly is the command you are using to mount the drive?
2011-01-19T02:35:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	mount/dev/cdrom
2011-01-19T02:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	do you have /dev/cdrom defined in /etc/fstab?  Otherwise you need to specify the mount like "mount /dev/cdrom /path" where "/path" is the directory under which the contents of the dvd should be displayed
2011-01-19T02:37:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	was the error something like "mount: can't find /dev/cdrom is /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab"?
2011-01-19T02:38:00.000Z	drpi		mbeirerl: well... no. I think I typed the wrong command, but it's something like that
2011-01-19T02:38:00.000Z	drpi		mbeirerl: all it's tell me is that it can't mount it because it's an unknown device
2011-01-19T02:40:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	sorry - I don't notice you if the nick is wrong.  Can you be more specific on the exact command you are using and the exact error message?
2011-01-19T02:41:00.000Z	drpi		mbeirerl: but my fstab doesn't say anything about my sr0(or cdrom)
2011-01-19T02:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	drpi	brb
2011-01-19T02:43:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	sudo mount /dev/sr0
2011-01-19T02:44:00.000Z	drpi	mbeierl	ok now I'm getting "mount: can't find /dev/sr0 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab" hmm...
