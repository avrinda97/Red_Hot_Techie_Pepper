2007-02-22T10:53:00.000Z	aeenima		im gonna ask one more time then i give up for now
2007-02-22T10:53:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	apt-cache policy libfaac-dev
2007-02-22T10:53:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	?
2007-02-22T10:54:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	so i can change it?
2007-02-22T10:54:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	what is the output from that command?
2007-02-22T10:56:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6978/
2007-02-22T10:56:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	you're not using the package from the ubuntu repositories, that's why your dependencies are all messed up...
2007-02-22T10:57:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	so?
2007-02-22T10:58:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	I'm explaining why your dependencies can't be met.  If you use ubuntu repositories, it should "just  work"
2007-02-22T10:59:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	you can edit the source package that you have there.  But why would you?  Just use the ubuntu packages
2007-02-22T11:00:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	but at this point...  im wondering how to resolve it.  remove the alternate repository?
2007-02-22T11:00:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	yes
2007-02-22T11:04:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	pastebin the error
2007-02-22T11:06:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	I'm guessing you have the libfaac0 from the outside repo installed?
2007-02-22T11:07:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	probably, see im trying to get the latest version of kino compiled/installed... the kino package on the ubuntu repsitory is too old and has bugs.. ive probably made a mess now
2007-02-22T11:07:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	try sudo apt-get install libfaac0=1.24clean-0ubuntu4  to downgrade
2007-02-22T11:07:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	k thanks
2007-02-22T11:10:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	you're suppose top check what it tells you it is going to do before press yes :/
2007-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	lol oh well heheh it did resolve the issue though, so now i was able to install the library it couldnt prior.  at this point ill just put back what i need that was uninstalled
2007-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	aeenima	jrib	thanks for the help mate, ill fight with it from here.  appreciate it
2007-02-22T11:11:00.000Z	jrib	aeenima	np
