2009-11-06T05:14:00.000Z	agoole		on upgrade to karmic, i get 50% packet loss on my wireless, anyone else get this ?
2009-11-06T05:16:00.000Z	agoole		anyone else here using karmic + broadcom wireless ?
2009-11-06T05:16:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	yes
2009-11-06T05:16:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	are you using the suggested drivers from the menu ? or did you download the broadcom drivers from the factory website ?
2009-11-06T05:18:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	i get really bad wireless, with 50% of the packets dropping
2009-11-06T05:18:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	google, b43-fwcutter for info on that
2009-11-06T05:18:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	is that the module you're using ?
2009-11-06T08:54:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	lspci | grep Broadcom
2009-11-06T08:59:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	ok, should the firmware run better than b43 ?
2009-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	yeah its listed
2009-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	yes I have it installed
2009-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	a quick way to check if you have b43-fwcutter is simply type b43- and tab
2009-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	should I use that to run the firmware ?
2009-11-06T09:02:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	once it's finished downloading, extract it with tar xjf [the file you just downloaded] and change directory to broadcom-wl-4.80.53.0/kmod
2009-11-06T09:03:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	from there run b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware wl_apsta.o
2009-11-06T09:03:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	then reboot and cross your fingers
2009-11-06T09:04:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	haha, ok, thank you, I will type and reboot and let you know, i'm on the desktop now, so i'll stay online
2009-11-06T09:19:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	hey, just finished rebooting, it had to do a drive check
2009-11-06T09:19:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	I had to run modprobe b43 to enable it
2009-11-06T09:19:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	it didn't come on its own
2009-11-06T09:20:00.000Z	insm0d	agoole	does it work better though?  If it does, you'll just need to enable the b43 driver at boottime
2009-11-06T09:21:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	going to try downloading and transfering a large file, see the results soon enough
2009-11-06T09:22:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	ugh, still transfering at less than 30kb/s
2009-11-06T09:22:00.000Z	agoole	insm0d	let me connect to a different wireless, and try a download
