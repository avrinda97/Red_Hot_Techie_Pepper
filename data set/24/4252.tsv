2007-05-28T08:32:00.000Z	jamster545_		sorry my crappy router keeps disconnecting
2007-05-28T08:33:00.000Z	jamster545_		now it wont let me PM
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	jamster545_	RAOF	it wont let me PM you anymore
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	You want to kill your old nick (using ghost), then re-identify as your registered nick.  Check out /msg nickserv help
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	jamster545_		ghost
2007-05-28T08:34:00.000Z	jamster545_		um i am gonna D/C and get back on
2007-05-28T08:36:00.000Z	jamster545_	RAOF	it wont let me log into my registered nick
2007-05-28T08:38:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	Because it doesn't think your existing connection has gone yet.  You want to check out "/msg nickserv ghost _yournick_ _yourpassword_"
2007-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	jamster545_		i got it
2007-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	But do that in the server-window, since if you get it wrong you'll have just broadcast your IRC password to the whole channel
2007-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	jamster545_		dammit!
2007-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	jamster545_		it wont kill the ghost!
2007-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	jamster545_		GHOST <jamster545> [alpha123] 
2007-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	jamster545_		that isnt my password
2007-05-28T08:43:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	So, you typed "/msg nickserv jamster545 alpha123" ?
2007-05-28T08:44:00.000Z	jamster545_		hold on
2007-05-28T08:44:00.000Z	jamster545_		it says my password is wrong
2007-05-28T08:45:00.000Z	jamster545_		dammit
2007-05-28T08:46:00.000Z	jamster545_	RAOF	it wont let me kill the ghost!
2007-05-28T08:47:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	Eh :(
2007-05-28T08:47:00.000Z	jamster545_		i typed my password right but it said my password was wrong
2007-05-28T08:47:00.000Z	RAOF	jamster545_	Well, we can continue in here.  You just need to run "gcc C++<tab>.cpp -lstdc++", making sure the filename ends up something like "C++\#1.cpp"
