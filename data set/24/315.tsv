2011-12-02T23:35:00.000Z	pransalad		Hi guys. trying to install ubuntu server right now, but booting CD gives me this error: gfxboot.c32: not a COM32R image. The cd works in a different machine. any ideas?
2011-12-02T23:37:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Which version of ubuntu server?
2011-12-02T23:38:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	latest. 11.10
2011-12-02T23:38:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Try typing "live" at the boot prompt.
2011-12-02T23:39:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Also, is this a literal CD or a USB installer from a Cd image?
2011-12-02T23:39:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	its doing *something*...
2011-12-02T23:40:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	typing live into boot option seems to just leave it hanging there
2011-12-02T23:40:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	OK. And this CD works on another machine?
2011-12-02T23:41:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	yes. works on a typical workstation. it is currently failing on a dell server
2011-12-02T23:42:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	yea 'live' just makes it hang there with nothing more
2011-12-02T23:44:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Interesting. Only seen that issue on USB sticks, where the "live" or "help" options are a workaround.
2011-12-02T23:45:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	any idea where i can go from here to get it working?
2011-12-02T23:48:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	I would file a bug report and/or post in the forums. Just to confirm, this is the server installer?
2011-12-02T23:49:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	correct
2011-12-02T23:50:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	I suppose you could just delete the gfxboot line in isolinux.cfg
2011-12-02T23:50:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	it might actually be loading now as i see the logo on screen now
2011-12-02T23:50:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Interesting. What did you change?
2011-12-02T23:51:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Also, did you check the disk for errors?
2011-12-02T23:52:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	my cd burning app had checked after writing, but thats all for error checking goes. i presumed that since it works without issue on other machines that wouldnt be a problem
2011-12-02T23:52:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Indeed.
2011-12-02T23:56:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	Is sublime in an official repo?
2011-12-02T23:57:00.000Z	pransalad	sskalnik	im unsure tbh
2011-12-02T23:57:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	I have not heard of it, but am interested in trying it.
2011-12-02T23:58:00.000Z	sskalnik	pransalad	A pity. I found it anyway. May give it a go.
