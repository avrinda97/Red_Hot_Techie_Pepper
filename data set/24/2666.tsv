2009-10-12T01:02:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		COME ON PEOPLE. There has to be at least one person in here who has at least some idea of what to do. and I *need* to get this thing up and running again/
2009-10-12T01:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	you need to be patient
2009-10-12T01:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	how are you accessing the system now?
2009-10-12T01:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	are you able to edit the configuration for grub 2/
2009-10-12T01:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	that allows for more flexibility
2009-10-12T01:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	while you're in the chroot, you may need to run upgrade-from-grub-legacy
2009-10-12T01:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	some forums has also suggested dpkg-reconfigure grub2
2009-10-12T05:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	I don't think there is a command for it
2009-10-12T05:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	those likely use another method (like gnome-panel intercepting the keystrokes and using a dbus call to show the desktop)
2009-10-12T05:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	look in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
2009-10-12T05:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	it doesn't use a script
2009-10-12T05:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	or it most likely doesn't
2009-10-12T05:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	as with a lot of other stuff in gnome, it probably sends a call via DBus to the window manager
2009-10-12T05:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	or it might use ICCM (ICCCM?) for that
2009-10-12T05:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	what do you need it for?
2009-10-18T09:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	I don't think it can be done
2009-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	it's using the development branding instea of the official branding
2009-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	only official builds from mozilla should use the official branding
2009-11-29T13:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	ctrl+alt+esc?
2009-11-29T13:13:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	lstarnes	yeah, not sure when it last worked, I know it did in 8.04, and I'm pretty sure about 8.10. 9.04 I dont think so though
2009-11-29T13:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	don't you mean ctrl+alt+backspace?
2009-11-29T13:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	I think that was an upstream change by Xorg's developers
2009-11-29T13:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	probably something about people hitting it accidentally
2009-11-29T13:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	GodfatherofEire	it can be reenabled
