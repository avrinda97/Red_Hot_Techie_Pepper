2006-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	change the file permissions, like:     chmod 666 myfile    if you want it read/write user/group/world
2006-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	do chmod 666 filename
2006-04-19T13:46:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	what?  didn't it work?
2006-04-19T13:47:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	did the chmod return any errors?
2006-04-19T13:47:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	and you used chmod 666 right?
2006-04-19T13:48:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	does ls -l filename show your account as being the owner of the file?
2006-04-19T13:48:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	you should do    sudo vim sshd.config
2006-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	and you should do chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2006-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	because you don't want regular users to be able to edit it, that would be insecure
2006-04-19T13:50:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	got it now?
2006-04-19T13:54:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	working now?
2006-04-19T13:54:00.000Z	wenko	solid_liq	ssh: connection to wenko@192.168.1.201:22 exited: No auth methods could be used.     is the error i still get
2006-04-19T13:54:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	but you could edit the file alright?
2006-04-19T13:55:00.000Z	solid_liq	wenko	pastebin your sshd_config file
2006-04-19T13:57:00.000Z	wenko	solid_liq	having some VNC issues...one moment
