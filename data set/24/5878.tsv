2012-06-01T08:31:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		Hello everybody. I'm interested in building a new rig and I was wondering if anybody with a UEFI-based board has had trouble getting Ubuntu installed.
2012-06-01T08:31:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		I've been kind of worried about being locked into a system where I can't disable secureboot.
2012-06-01T08:32:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	that's unlikely to be an issue, even when they start shipping
2012-06-01T08:32:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	I have seen a bunch of AMD boards with UEFI, wasn't sure if it had shipped. I suppose I should call the manufacturer just to make sure.
2012-06-01T08:33:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	UEFI and secure boot aren't the same thing
2012-06-01T08:33:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	neither are anything to be worried about
2012-06-01T08:33:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	I understand that. I was asking because I know it's a feature that's supposed to ship with UEFI boards.
2012-06-01T08:33:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	what were you asking, again?
2012-06-01T08:34:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	I suppose what I was asking is if I am likely going to run into the secureboot issue with the UEFI boards that are already out.
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	you could but it's unlikely
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	what you'd want to keep an eye out is for things labelled 'Made for Microsoft Windows 8' or something to that effect
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	ahh, then that's good news.
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	to have such a boast associated with a product they're required to use secure boot
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	without such a boast they are under no such obligation to Microsoft
2012-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	right, I know that the x86 certification program requires a way to get rid of it.
2012-06-01T08:36:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	ahh, well I'm definitely avoiding the ARM hardware. I'm probably going to get an RPI or Beagleboard instead.
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	those are ARM, IIRC
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	oh :)
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	yeah, I don't mind ARM itself.
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	yeah you won't find any issues on such conscientious offerings
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	it'll just be Windows 8 tablets, some of them, and possibly some Apple ones in future
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	reisio	Sir_Fawnpug	and of course it'll only be an issue before people figure out how to work around it :p
2012-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	haha, well I suppose I'm not hedging my bets on it. I'd rather work with unencumbered software anyway, I'm playing around with OS dev, and I'd like to... you know... be able to boot my kernel, haha
2012-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	reisio	I remember VIA working on a similar board, not sure how hacker friendly it's going to be.
