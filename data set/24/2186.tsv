2009-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	Tecumseh		i am having some issues with installation can anyone help me?
2009-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	Tecumseh		my computer turns off when the installation reaches the partition process
2009-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	Tecumseh		anyone help?
2009-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	Turns off or reboots?
2009-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	interesting... have you run a mem test on it?
2009-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	interesting... sure its a good iso and burn?
2009-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	are you asking the installer to resize anything?
2009-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	using the alternate or live cd?
2009-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	is the installer text based or does it boot into the desktop and your run the installer?
2009-09-08T05:32:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	ok its a live cd then.
2009-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	does your windows install boot?
2009-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	or you could just run a cd integ test from the cd boot menu.
2009-09-08T05:49:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	you can quite happily dualboot vista and Ubuntu
2009-09-08T05:50:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	The installer should handle installation of grub and give you menu item for Vista.
2009-09-08T05:50:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	test a test show it was a bad burn?  also if you want to be really careful a check of the iso file with MD5 or SHA would be a good idea
2009-09-08T05:51:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	irq 9 is a cascade irq for the PC... you really should nt have issues with it unless you have old ISA cards AND PCI cards fighting over it.
2009-09-08T05:53:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	check your BIOS and see how IRQ 9 is assigned... what might be using it... do you have any ISA cards in that PC
2009-09-08T05:54:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	are you familiar with your BIOS setup utility?
2009-09-08T05:58:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	if you have a hardware issue (even just a config issue - not just broken hardware), that can certainly cause an install fail... considering two distros have complained about a device they think is in irq9 not responding I'd say you need to check your laptops BIOS to see if there is something there that may be assigned to irq9 that should not be)
2009-09-08T06:42:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	yup
2009-09-08T06:43:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	Yay!
2009-09-08T06:43:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	you will enjoy it :)
2009-09-08T06:45:00.000Z	QPrime	Tecumseh	Like I said in the PM its a very different Kernel with a very un-windows way of dealing with caching/scheduling etc... :)
