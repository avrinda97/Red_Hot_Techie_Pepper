2007-09-27T10:48:00.000Z	godzirra		Ok.. silly question.  My cdrom drive isn't in my fstab and i'm not sure what device it is?   I tried /dev/cdrom but it says special device /dev/cdrom does not exist.  I also tried /dev/hda through /dev/hdd.
2007-09-27T10:50:00.000Z	godzirra		I've no idea..  it worked before when I had it installed for a long time.

2007-09-27T10:53:00.000Z	godzirra		nope.
2007-09-27T10:53:00.000Z	godzirra		ls /dev/*cd* only returns ttycd and ptycd.
2007-09-27T10:54:00.000Z	godzirra		So what can I do to fix it?
2007-09-27T10:56:00.000Z	godzirra		dmesg | grep -i cd only returns uhci_hcd stuff (USB crap)
2007-09-27T10:56:00.000Z	godzirra		nothing about a cdrom.
2007-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	godzirra		well crap.
2007-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	godzirra		thanks anyways.
2007-09-27T10:57:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	is the cable secure to the cd?
2007-09-27T10:59:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	add the words " noapic nolapic " to the end of your booting kernel line in menu.lst
2007-09-27T11:00:00.000Z	godzirra	warbler	and reboot?
2007-09-27T11:00:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	yep
2007-09-27T11:03:00.000Z	godzirra	warbler	still nothing except the ttycd and ptycd when I do ls /dev/*cd*
2007-09-27T11:04:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	I should have been more specific maybe - the line that ends in quiet splash is the one in menu.lst that you add to - did you do it like that/
2007-09-27T11:05:00.000Z	godzirra	warbler	other than that one all I had was the memtest line and the recovery mode line.  I didnt add it to those two.. i added it to the main one.
2007-09-27T11:06:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	that was right
2007-09-27T11:06:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	getting a forum link for similar prob with solution brb
2007-09-27T11:07:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	try this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3426098
2007-09-27T11:09:00.000Z	godzirra	warbler	it worked before and I didnt have to hcange any bios settings.
2007-09-27T11:10:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	worth a check - especially if you upgraded like them in the thread
2007-09-27T11:11:00.000Z	warbler	godzirra	for one minutes trouble i'd check
