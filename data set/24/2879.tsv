2008-07-11T01:13:00.000Z	Rumple1		Question: I am trying to use the Terminal Service Client to control an XP machine, the XP machine has a static IP, port forwarding set up and allows remote connections. However when I try to connect I get  a 'connection refused' error. What could be wrong and how do I fix it?
2008-07-11T01:14:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	is the xp machine behind a firewall?
2008-07-11T01:15:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	I disabled the machines XP firewall completely.
2008-07-11T01:16:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	are you doing so across a LAN?
2008-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	No, over the internet.
2008-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	so the xp box is connected directly without a firewall?
2008-07-11T01:17:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	i mean, firewall/router
2008-07-11T01:18:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	verify your port forwarding on the router
2008-07-11T01:22:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	I have comfirmed the port forwarding set up, I followed the guide on http://portforward.com/routers.htm
2008-07-11T01:23:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	if you still cant get it to work, maybe try another port... never know what the ISP might be blocking
2008-07-11T01:34:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	are you trying to find the ip of your xp box remotely?
2008-07-11T01:36:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	No, I am trying to test connecting to another computer outside my lan.
2008-07-11T01:36:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	did you try changing the port?
2008-07-11T01:37:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	I am trying to find a guide online that will help me change the port, I am not sure how to do it.
2008-07-11T01:38:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	you should be able to set the external port to whatever you want, and just keep the internal port the same
2008-07-11T01:38:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	on your router
2008-07-11T01:38:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	Would I do this on the XP box, the target of the Terminal SErver client?
2008-07-11T01:40:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	 on the firewall, change the port on the internet side to a different port, then connect with the different port through the terminal client on your ubuntu box
2008-07-11T01:41:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	How do I change the port on my TSC?
2008-07-11T01:42:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	try this:  ipaddress:port
2008-07-11T01:47:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	I am a bit of a newbie when it comes to net problems, I am unable to ping the target XP box with either my linux box or my vista box. I think that is a problem for the TSC, yes?
2008-07-11T01:48:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	it seems to me that the key of your problem is the router.  try connecting the xp box directly to the internet to see if it is really your router setup or not
2008-07-11T01:49:00.000Z	Rumple1	Splex	I will try that.
2008-07-11T01:52:00.000Z	Splex	Rumple1	np, but i suggest you try to adjust your router to get it to work, its crazy to connect any version of windows to the internet directly!
