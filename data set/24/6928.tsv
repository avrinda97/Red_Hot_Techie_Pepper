2005-06-11T15:34:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	why would it be ethically unsound to include Java in your distro?
2005-06-11T15:34:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	it's non-free
2005-06-11T15:35:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	there are free versions that Ubuntu should include. Java is too powerful to be disincluded from a distrobution.
2005-06-11T15:36:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	personally, i agree. but complain to Sun. the apache foundation seeks to change all that, with a GPL'd distribution of java
2005-06-11T15:38:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	if you want that install Mepis or Xandros. their KDE suites do support X configuration from the desktop
2005-06-11T15:38:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	I am able to edit configuration files but I thought my programming skills could possibly be used for usability purposes.
2005-06-11T15:40:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	where do you teach Linux at?
2005-06-11T15:40:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	i teach game development at various instutitions throughout Europe
2005-06-11T15:41:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	awesome. I was hoping for an approach closer to grade school so I could obtain advice but cool none the less.
2005-06-11T15:42:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	right. you want to get into game development?
2005-06-11T15:45:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	I want to teach Linux. I feel there are many people that can benefit from it but are scared.
2005-06-11T15:45:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	I feel that students today are becoming less educated than my generation with computers. They learn one set of software instead of how to use a computer.
2005-06-11T15:47:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	game development has great payoff. i teach only FOSS game development, which is a big, yet new area many institutions are exploring
2005-06-11T15:48:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	That is great! Do you guys have anything available to the public to play with? That is very respectful of you to do that.
2005-06-11T15:48:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	see wmi.modprobe.de
2005-06-11T15:48:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	do you mean games?
2005-06-11T15:49:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	Yup! Teaching in its self is a very respectiful position in my eyes.
2005-06-11T15:49:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	my students here in denmark have made a bunch of games. i'll be uploading a few soon enough.
2005-06-11T15:59:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	good for you.
2005-06-12T16:01:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	unfortunatly for us, there's not really an alternative for Cedega other than windows.
2005-06-12T16:02:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	don't get me wrong. i understand ;) the more money that goes to Cedega the less native Linux games we have. interesting there's nothing like it for Apple, and of course Windows.
2005-06-12T16:03:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	I guess its still 'write to my devs and gripe'. Too bad EA is taking over all my favorites. when they destroyed Westwood, I was quite irate.
2005-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	delire	Shiggity	they really do represent the death of a great many startup and medium sized dev companies.
2005-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	Shiggity	delire	Do you think that you will be able to put out developers that would be able to help give better Linux games so that cedegla would be useless for Ubuntu and other distros?
