2007-04-25T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Did you look at the link from ubotu?
2007-04-25T08:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	And did it work?
2007-04-25T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	OK, first thing you are going to need a program that can play DVD's ( Totem can't do the menus ) I recommend VLC
2007-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	You shouldn't need to download anything yourself
2007-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Have you installed libdvdread ?
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	It is technically illegal in the United States to play encripted DVD's in Linux, so it can't be included in Add / Remove
2007-04-25T08:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	You can install it from Synaptic package manager or from the terminal run: sudo apt-get install libdvdread3
2007-04-25T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	No, it means that it is just a little hard to get DVD support, I wouldn't worry about the fact that it is "illegal" anybody would be laphed at if they tried to prosecute you for watching a DVD you payed for :)
2007-04-25T08:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Applications -> acessories -> Terminal and System -> administration -> synaptic
2007-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Sorry, those were two seperate things, Synaptic is in the System menu at the top of the screen
2007-04-25T08:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	When you run "sudo apt-get install libdvdread3" ?
2007-04-25T08:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	You need to type that command into the terminal ( sudo apt-get install libdvdread3 )
2007-04-25T08:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Good, that means that it is already installed
2007-04-25T08:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Now run this in the terminal "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh"
2007-04-25T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Do you want to come over to #ubuntu-classroom where there are less people, I might have to ask a lot of questions to find out where the install script is on your computer
2007-04-25T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	/join #ubuntu-classroom
2007-04-25T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	Type "/join #ubuntu-classroom" in as if you were saying something in the channel
2007-04-25T09:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	yup
2007-04-25T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	:)
2007-04-25T09:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Witchery	No problem :)
