2008-10-05T23:25:00.000Z	geremy		parallel question, is there an x server irc?
2008-10-05T23:26:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: are you trying to build a custom iso?
2008-10-05T23:26:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: do the disk check, that generally means that the initramfs isnt working
2008-10-05T23:27:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: ok, then d/l the iso again and burn it over
2008-10-05T23:28:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: if it says its a bad burn, odds are high its a bad burn.
2008-10-05T23:28:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto
2008-10-05T23:30:00.000Z	geremy		klaus8: that should be in the link I gave

2008-10-05T23:35:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	geremy	missing something
2008-10-05T23:37:00.000Z	geremy	Killer--Tux	it is almost certain to be easier to do it from the repos than compiling it manually, and is cleaner in the end. if you can pastebin the output from that command it will help me pin things down
2008-10-05T23:37:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	geremy	his is what am missing :  Unable to find libncurses or libcurses
2008-10-05T23:38:00.000Z	geremy	Killer--Tux	sudo apt-get update
2008-10-05T23:39:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	geremy	this is what i get
2008-10-05T23:40:00.000Z	geremy	Killer--Tux	that means it worked
2008-10-05T23:40:00.000Z	geremy	Killer--Tux	or rather, that it worked already
2008-10-05T23:41:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	geremy	 this is the output
2008-10-05T23:42:00.000Z	geremy	Killer--Tux	that's a configuration problem- the program is installed
2008-10-05T23:43:00.000Z	Killer--Tux	geremy	 how do i go about configuring it ?!?
