2012-11-11T20:14:00.000Z	Yakut		can I downgrade Ubuntu to 12.04 without full Ubuntu 12.04 downloading?
2012-11-11T20:14:00.000Z	Yakut		from 12.10
2012-11-11T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	the only way to downgrade to a previous release is a clean install
2012-11-11T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	wassup?
2012-11-11T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	what video chip are you using?
2012-11-11T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	what video chip are you using?
2012-11-11T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	does it have hybrid graphics?
2012-11-11T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	then you will get problems
2012-11-11T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics  is all I know
2012-11-11T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	if you intend to use Linux based OS it is best (imho) to flat out avoid that mess
2012-11-11T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	I assume nothing
2012-11-11T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	have you tried a different desktop?
2012-11-11T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	yes, install xfce4   then log off and log in to the XFCE session, is it ok there?
2012-11-11T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	then why did you fix it?
2012-11-11T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	you fixed something that wasn't broken....
2012-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	not really, 12.04 is LTS so is designed to be super stable
2012-11-11T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	no, its just not LTS
2012-11-11T20:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	all software has bugs in some form
2012-11-11T20:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	did you try the XFCE desktop?
2012-11-11T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	I suggest you do
2012-11-11T20:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	why do you need to hit ENTER after every other word?
2012-11-11T20:51:00.000Z	Yakut	ActionParsnip	I dont know
2012-11-11T20:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yakut	try the other desktop, see how it goes
