2006-06-18T06:53:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1		hi. I've just inserted 'noapic' and 'nolapic' at the end of my linuk kernal boot loader entry to prevent some weird freezing. Its booted OK, which is good. But can anyone explain to me what I've done by turning off these values? Is it good to do so or will I be effecting my system in other ways?
2006-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	you have turned off buggy hardware - read wiki.ubuntu.com/BootOptions
2006-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	thanks - i will read that now
2006-06-18T06:54:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	it explains what they do at some level
2006-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	I have read the Wiki as you suggested. "Does not start the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). Can prevent the impact of bad ACPI implementations, which in turn cause random reboots or system lockups." All becomes clear now, thanks
2006-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	additionally, I no longer have ACPI errors at the end of my dmesg
2006-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	well it got written for just that reason ;-)
2006-06-18T07:00:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	give out to the manafacturer they may have a new bios for that box
2006-06-18T07:01:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	how did you find that particular page? If I click on the home of the Ubuntu Wiki it's not an abvious link. Is it deep rooted within nests?
2006-06-18T07:02:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	I wrote it
2006-06-18T07:02:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	aaaah - :-) good man
2006-06-18T07:02:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	more correctly I started it
2007-02-20T14:28:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	size of the machine and disks?
2007-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	4 x 160Gb disks connected via PCI IDE Adaptor.
2007-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	serving what size of a network?
2007-02-20T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	i.e. user base
2007-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	userbase = 1 (me!) - network is 4 machines and two laptops connected via 1 ethernet and wireless Router. Never more than two people accessing
2007-02-20T14:30:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	no would not use it unless you were learning it for work purposes
2007-02-20T14:31:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	i was wanting to create a single storage space (of half a terabyte) but my IDE adapter is not reliable as a RAID device (it's not a true hardware RAID interface)
2007-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	also interested from a work point of view
2007-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	then that is even more reason not to span stuff across it
2007-02-20T14:32:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	you don't think lvm would cope with it very well?
2007-02-20T14:33:00.000Z	ompaul	gizmo_the_great1	you have said your hardware is not great so then I would not span data across it in the hope that single disks would survive rather than ones with data spanning disk after disk
2007-02-20T14:33:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	ompaul	i guess so. thanks for the adbvice
