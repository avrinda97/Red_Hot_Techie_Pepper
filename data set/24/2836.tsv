2011-07-18T05:24:00.000Z	Owner		is there a way I can get my username on linux, I forgot what it was since it's been set
2011-07-18T05:25:00.000Z	szal	Owner	ls -lA /home/ <- the user dirs are named after the users
2011-07-18T05:25:00.000Z	szal	Owner	unless you have a user without a home dir, but that's a highly unlikely configuration for a general-purpose user
2011-07-18T05:27:00.000Z	szal	Owner	why so?
2011-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	szal	Owner	as I said, use a live medium to identify the user's home folder, then you have the name
2011-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	szal	Owner	any live CD you can come up with
2011-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	szal	Owner	e.g.
2011-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	szal	Owner	but why 'another'?
2011-07-18T05:29:00.000Z	szal	Owner	no loss; burn another one ^^
2011-07-18T05:34:00.000Z	Owner	szal	after loading the disc what do I do afterwords
2011-07-18T05:36:00.000Z	szal	Owner	find out what partition contains your /home/ folder, mount that & look at it
2011-07-18T05:37:00.000Z	szal	Owner	if in doubt, just mount all partitions, doesn't hurt ;)
2011-07-18T05:39:00.000Z	szal	Owner	if you have only 1 partition, you will find a /home/ directory there containing the users' personal directories; if you have a separate partition for /home/, you will see the users' directories directly there
2011-07-18T05:39:00.000Z	szal	Owner	no, you boot from the CD
2011-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	szal	Owner	is that a live CD or an alternate CD?
2011-07-18T05:41:00.000Z	szal	Owner	wait a sec, I'll boot a live CD
2011-07-18T05:42:00.000Z	szal	Owner	it's an alternate CD, get a live CD
2011-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	szal	Owner	you need one that says 'desktop' in the filename
2011-07-18T05:49:00.000Z	szal	Owner	gotta grab some sleep, be back around 0900 UTC, just in the unlikely case you won't find other assistance here
2011-07-18T05:57:00.000Z	szal	Owner	right
2011-07-18T06:07:00.000Z	szal	Owner	nothing special, just start the live system (in your case likely: "Start Xubuntu"), wait till the desktop is there, then use file browser to look through the hard drive partitions to find either /home/ or the user dir(s) (in the former case the user dir(s) will be in /home/)
2011-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	Owner	szal	 you on
2011-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	szal	Owner	obviously ;)
2011-07-18T17:16:00.000Z	Owner	szal	 I am wanting my computer to autologin. I am at the login screen settings but it will not allow me to choose myself to autologin, how do I fix this
