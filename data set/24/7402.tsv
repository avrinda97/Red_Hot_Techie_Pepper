2005-05-18T16:00:00.000Z	willis		anyone running breezy, and installed beagle or linux-image-2.6.12 from repositories?
2005-05-18T16:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	i suspect that beagle needs some deps before it hits the repos
2005-05-18T16:01:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	i saw it on the beagle upstream, but i can only find it in the breezy_universe_sources list
2005-05-18T16:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	it has built, but not in the repos, I don't know why
2005-05-18T16:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	it has built correctly
2005-05-18T16:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	it just isn't there yet
2005-05-18T16:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	I would wait, the mono stuff is being built right now
2005-05-18T16:04:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	ah ok, for some reason, lot's of the things i noticed coming in on the breezy-changes list, aren't  reflected in aptitude, ( i'm just a sucker for the new stuff )
2005-05-18T16:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	that means the source has been accepted
2005-05-18T16:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	it may not even build
2005-05-18T16:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	http://people.ubuntu.com/~lamont/buildLogs/byDate/today.html
2005-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	ok hmm, thanks
2005-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	there are a lot of major changes happening right now
2005-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	yeah so a lot of things are getting built but a lot are failing as well
2005-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	expect breakage and don't bug the dev team about packages not showing up
2005-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	the date by which you should start asking is around late Sept.
2005-05-18T16:07:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	i guess before when i was watching hoary-changes, most of the builds were succesful, so the packages would end up as binaries in an hour or so, but because of the volitale nature of breezy many of these builds won't go through right away
2005-05-18T16:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	change over to gcc 4.0 is a big one
2005-05-18T16:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	and the general sync to sid
2005-05-18T16:07:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	yeah i know
2005-05-18T16:09:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	i just found beagle in the build log, built succesfuly
2005-05-18T16:09:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	but it isn't there, I have no idea why
2005-05-18T16:09:00.000Z	willis	Burgundavia	ok, well thanks anyway
2005-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	willis	i have
