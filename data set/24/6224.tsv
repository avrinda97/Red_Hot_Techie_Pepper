2009-09-24T10:15:00.000Z	ryguy		omg that was supposed to be on one line sorry guys
2009-09-24T10:15:00.000Z	ryguy		but what I was gettin at is are any of those important
2009-09-24T10:15:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	For whom?
2009-09-24T10:15:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	I wouldn't want to uninstall those, at least. :-)
2009-09-24T10:16:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	I have both fakeroot and vlc installed at the same time, though, so something is wrong.
2009-09-24T10:16:00.000Z	ryguy	shachaf	should I just try to install it from source? or what?
2009-09-24T10:17:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	Um, which package exactly does it conflict with
2009-09-24T10:17:00.000Z	ryguy	shachaf	I'm not sure, all I know is that it has that huge list of what will be removed
2009-09-24T10:18:00.000Z	ryguy	shachaf	for the most partim just running a basic xubuntu setup
2009-09-24T10:19:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	What does vlc conflict with? It looks like it's just vlc-nox to me.
2009-09-24T10:20:00.000Z	ryguy	shachaf	i did apt-get install and it's telling me this: The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: debootstrap fakeroot python-pyinotify diffstat libmono0 debhelper intltool-debian postfix patchutils libapr1 po-debconf subversion libpod-coverage-perl libmail-sendmail-perl libsvn1 libdevel-symdump-perl gettext libio-stringy-perl devscripts libipc-run-perl dctrl-tools libauthen-sasl-perl dput libparse-deb
2009-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	Yes, you said that. It doesn't say very much...
2009-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	Does `apt-cache show vlc` say it conflicts with something?
2009-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	ryguy	shachaf	Conflicts: vlc-nox (<< 0.9.2-1)
2009-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	It means exactly what it says.
2009-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	Those "packages were automatically installed and are no longer required".
2009-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	No, it's not installed.
2009-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shachaf	ryguy	You'll get that message no matter what you install.
