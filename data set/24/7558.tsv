2004-10-09T07:06:00.000Z	beboop		Newbie question if someone has time
2004-10-09T07:06:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	ask not to ask, just ask.
2004-10-09T07:07:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	asking to ask a question using up your quota of one question per newbie :p
2004-10-09T07:08:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	nothing as your kicked back to the loging prompt nothing or nothing as in login goes away but it's not doing anything nothing?
2004-10-09T07:10:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	sounds like you're just getting a text console...so things are working....
2004-10-09T07:11:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	you don't get past the console...you use it! :D
2004-10-09T07:11:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	try ctrl+f7
2004-10-09T07:12:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	I'm not sure...did you finish the 2nd stage of the install yet?
2004-10-09T07:13:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	I am on my XP box right now :(
2004-10-09T07:15:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	what does the command "startx" do?
2004-10-09T07:16:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	assuming your xserver is configured, it will start the gui.
2004-10-09T07:16:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	I see.....so type this in when exactly? Being as I cannot login for some reason
2004-10-09T07:17:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	you said you get something like beboop@ubuntu$ type prompt after entering your username & password?
2004-10-09T07:18:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	yes I do and I am hung up at that point not knowing what command I am to type
2004-10-09T07:18:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	that is logged in my friend. :)
2004-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	to me, it sounds like what happened is either a> your xserver didn't get configured properly by the installer or b> the xserver didn't get installed at all.
2004-10-09T07:20:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	....command lines...ah yes....this is abit new to me although I have used Mandrake and ArkLinux before
2004-10-09T07:21:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	so try startx...if you get a gui, you're just missing the display manger, so apt-get install gdm should fix that. If you get an error message, dpgk-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 (Ubuntu people jump in here if Ubuntu has a better way, all I know is debian right now!). If that doesn't work, apt-get install xserver-xfree86 gdm
2004-10-09T07:24:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	get a beer or two in you, it'll help. Really ;-)
2004-10-09T07:24:00.000Z	beboop	Zibby	my monitor settings
2004-10-09T07:27:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	I don't see any reason to get into that problem if you don't have your gui working anyway...one thing at a time ;)
2004-10-09T07:29:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	also, try running apt-get dselect-upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade...that might finish installing packages that didn't install for whatever reason.
2004-10-09T07:29:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	odds are linux is configuring a different refresh than Windows is...shouldn't be hard to fix once the gui is actually working
2004-10-09T07:30:00.000Z	Zibby	beboop	maybe when you come back I'll have my Ubuntu install finished :p
