2012-11-03T23:43:00.000Z	Kishi		...I've violated what?
2012-11-03T23:43:00.000Z	Kishi		Oh, I didn't realise.
2012-11-03T23:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	root passwords need to die
2012-11-03T23:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	they've been obsolete for a good twenty years or so
2012-11-03T23:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	wrong
2012-11-03T23:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	you should *never* have a valid root password
2012-11-03T23:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	because it's fundamentally insecure
2012-11-03T23:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	anybody with the root password can do anything
2012-11-03T23:46:00.000Z	Kishi	gordonjcp	So can a person with an administrator password, because what sudo does is executing a single command as root
2012-11-03T23:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	no, it doesn't
2012-11-03T23:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	it just happens to be configured that way in the trivial case
2012-11-03T23:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	you can lock down what people can do with sudo to a very fine degree, and sort out all sorts of logging
2012-11-03T23:48:00.000Z	Kishi	gordonjcp	I've never tried it, but I believe Linux will be as happy to rm -rf the root directory with sudo prefix as it would be with su
2012-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	did you read *anything* I said?
2012-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	clearly not
2012-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	I can set you up an account on this machine, give you sudo access and let you bang away with sudo rm -rf * anywhere you like
2012-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	Kishi	gordonjcp	Perhaps. I'm not too experienced and armed with arguments to wage nerd wars yet ;/
2012-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	I guarantee you'll only be able to take out your homedir
2012-11-04T00:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	who has?
2012-11-04T00:46:00.000Z	Kishi	gordonjcp	ArchOpenBox
2012-11-04T00:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	oh, well
2012-11-04T00:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	maybe he should have stopped gibbering on about Arch and annoying the ops the first time he was told, or the second maybe
2012-11-04T00:48:00.000Z	Kishi	gordonjcp	I'm not sure I understand, Is he not allowed to express his opinion that "Arch is better" here?
2012-11-04T00:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kishi	is it relevant to Ubuntu support?
