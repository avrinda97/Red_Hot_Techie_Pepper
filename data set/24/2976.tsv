2008-06-09T00:30:00.000Z	wasup		Trying to connect to a wireless connection on ubuntu hardy heron... help please!!
2008-06-09T00:31:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	just state your problem, what you've tried and what the results were
2008-06-09T00:31:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	I don't know how to access the wireless network in my house using a Dell TrueMobile 1300 card on an inspiron 1000
2008-06-09T00:32:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	I've tried to connect but couldn't
2008-06-09T00:32:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	did you read the wiki?
2008-06-09T00:32:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	when you say you've tried what do you mean? Are you using the gnome-network applet?
2008-06-09T00:32:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	I don't know what that is...
2008-06-09T00:33:00.000Z	neurobuntu		there is a little icon on the top right of the screen, it looks like a computer screen, click on this and it should allow you to select a wifi hotspot
2008-06-09T00:34:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	there are no wireless hotspots available and when I try to search for one it can't find it

2008-06-09T00:34:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	does that mean truemobile 1300 isn't available?
2008-06-09T00:35:00.000Z	neurobuntu		well it should be more of an issue with your wifi card then the hotspot
2008-06-09T00:35:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	that seems to be the case... I don't know how to get my card working
2008-06-09T00:35:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	I read something about NDISwrapper?
2008-06-09T00:36:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	I don't have any experience with NDISwrapper, but it is a pretty common thing to fix, try googling for :NDIS Wrapper <Your Card ID> Ubuntu and I'm ceratin you'll get some hits
2008-06-09T00:36:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	is my card ID truemobile 1300 or somethign else?
2008-06-09T00:37:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	Am I going to have to compile something :(  I don't know how to .
2008-06-09T00:37:00.000Z	wasup		HardDick: ndisgtk?
2008-06-09T00:37:00.000Z	wasup		HardDisk*
2008-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	its pretty easy, there should be step by step instructions
2008-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	wasup		precompiled and everything?
2008-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	neurobuntu	wasup	there is also a #ndiswrapper channel, they should know more then I do
2008-06-09T00:39:00.000Z	wasup	neurobuntu	I was in it when you joined and left but no one is active :P
