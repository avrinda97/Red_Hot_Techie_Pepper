2006-04-28T14:22:00.000Z	joshritger		i can't get a disk to mount
2006-04-28T14:22:00.000Z	joshritger		i am following the online guide
2006-04-28T14:22:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	What are you doing, and what is it telling you?
2006-04-28T14:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Well, what I am asking is what the guide is telling you to do. What commands do you issue?
2006-04-28T14:24:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Okay, thats a start. What errors do you get?
2006-04-28T14:25:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Have you installed a new disk that you have just gotten from a store?
2006-04-28T14:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Since you have been following that guide, what did "sudo lshw -C disk" tell you, did you find your disk in the list it outputs?
2006-04-28T14:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Okay. Which device is it? Like /dev/hda or /dev/hdb or something. And, what filesystem have you got on it?
2006-04-28T14:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Okay. Have you got somewhere you would like to mount it?
2006-04-28T14:28:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	then "mkdir /media/hdd"
2006-04-28T14:29:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Sorry, put "sudo" in front of that command.
2006-04-28T14:30:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Thats good. Now you do "sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdd1 /media/hdd"
2006-04-28T14:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Good. Then you can try using it for something. what does issuing "df" tell you?
2006-04-28T14:32:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Well, there's a difference in partitioning it and formatting it. Did you actually do mkfs.ext3 on it?
2006-04-28T14:32:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	what does "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdd" tell you about it?
2006-04-28T14:34:00.000Z	joshritger	kingspawn	is there anyhting in particular that i should look for?
2006-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Information about hdd1
2006-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	joshritger	kingspawn	it says Disk /dev/hdd: 2269 MB, 2269863936 bytes
2006-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Well, that seems alright. And dont paste many lines at a time in here.
2006-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	If you type "df -h" does it tell you something about hdd1 or /media/hdd?
2006-04-28T14:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	df -h  is certainly there. did you type it correctly?
2006-04-28T14:39:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	I want to know if it lists some info about /media/hdd
2006-04-28T14:40:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	Well then, my friend, it is mounted.
2006-04-28T14:41:00.000Z	kingspawn	joshritger	If you just use your file manager to browse to /media/hdd, it's there
