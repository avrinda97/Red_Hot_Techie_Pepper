2009-11-07T01:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	which version of kde are you using?
2009-11-07T01:57:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	freeride, xamox thanks for you replies, i have already installed compiz but i cannot get the cube effect, i can just get two desktops
2009-11-07T01:58:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	im using 4.3 i think
2009-11-07T01:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	you probably need compiz-kde and libcompizconfig-backend-kconfig instyalled too
2009-11-07T02:00:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	didnt know kde specific packages existed i will try installing them
2009-11-27T05:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	you may repeat, but don't do it too frequently
2009-11-27T05:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	the irc command for joining a channel is /join #channel.  maybe he missed the /?
2009-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	huh?
2009-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	just be patient and keep watching this channel. You could also check the online forums for ubuntu
2009-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	I personally don't know how to fix your issue, sorry
2009-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	someone else here might know, but it's not exactly a common issue
2009-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	ok thanks for your help :)
2009-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	what you are trying to do might not be possible
2009-11-27T05:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	you could try deleting the swap partition, resizing the ubuntu partition, then creating a logical partition for swap
2009-11-27T05:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	I don't know if that would work though
2009-11-27T05:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	you can edit it in /etc/fstab, I think
2009-11-27T05:17:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	i'll google it thanks for your help! very appreciated
2009-12-12T07:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	what gave you that error?
2009-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	installing pygame
2009-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Alan502	make sure that you installed build-essential
2009-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	Alan502	lstarnes	i dont! thanks :)
