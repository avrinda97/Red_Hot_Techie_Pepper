2005-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah		help? plz................
2005-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	did you ask a question?
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	you mean, you installed ubuntu, then after that, reinstalled windows?
2005-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	nickrud	when i resized my two existing partitions to make a third one windows got messed up
2005-07-27T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	ah, I was swinging at low fruit :)
2005-07-27T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	you can boot ubuntu, but not use sudo?
2005-07-27T09:47:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	I'd look at /etc/hosts, it should have a line similar to 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost hector , where hector is your machine name
2005-07-27T09:48:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	PC (?)
2005-07-27T09:49:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	nickrud	PC is my machine name
2005-07-27T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	I use names from the illiad, cuz I have no imagination either :)
2005-07-27T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	then you have troubles
2005-07-27T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	you can use http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/713 as a replacement for /etc/hosts
2005-07-27T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	replace hector with whatever     uname -n     returns in a terminal
2005-07-27T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	that will probably fix some of the problems
2005-07-27T09:57:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	nickrud	on my first boot after install it took like 1hr 30 mins to load
2005-07-27T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	no, and, I'm not good with installs
2005-07-27T10:05:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	nickrud	what is hdparm?
2005-07-27T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	hdparm is not much needed for anything but setting up the cdrom, normally
2005-07-27T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	sorry, called awa for a sec
2005-07-27T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	but, /etc/hdparm.conf is where you set that stuff
2005-07-27T10:16:00.000Z	bahblahblahbah	nickrud	if i change the file system of a partition it only formats that partition right?
2005-07-27T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	bahblahblahbah	in what context? but in cfdisk, and the ubuntu install, I will say es
