2005-06-16T07:41:00.000Z	ABPSoft		Hi
2005-06-16T07:43:00.000Z	ABPSoft		Anyone here knows how the LiveCD gets dm-snapshot over cloop?
2005-06-16T07:44:00.000Z	ABPSoft		I've tried that myself and cloop just shredders most of the data
2005-06-16T07:44:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	maybe the livecdcustomizationhowto page can shed some light
2005-06-16T07:45:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	No, it doesn't really
2005-06-16T07:45:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	It doesn't give a hint where I may find the patch that Ubuntu apparently uses to get a working cloop into the kernel
2005-06-16T07:46:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	hmm, maybe in ubuntu-kernel-patch oslt
2005-06-16T07:47:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	I'll have a look. Didn't find any kernel-* packages so far, but didn't look for onews starting with u ;)
2005-06-16T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	kernel packageas are called linux-imag-*
2005-06-16T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	kernel packageas are called linux-image-*
2005-06-16T07:49:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	No ubuntu-kernel* in /ubuntu/pool/main/u so far
2005-06-16T07:50:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	linux-patch-ubuntu
2005-06-16T07:51:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	My goodnes, they released .12 ;)
2005-06-16T07:51:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	ONLY IN BREEZY
2005-06-16T07:51:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	Also found loop-modules, I'll look further
2005-06-16T08:02:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	Ok, the cloop stuff is indeed in this patch. No I'll try to port that into my kernel.
2005-06-16T08:21:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	*Thanks* - applied that patch, used the new cloop, works as it have should yesterday with the vanilla package
2005-06-16T08:21:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	nice!
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	Any idea who did this patch? It should really be fed back to Klaus Knopper et al
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	Or ideally, to Linus for inclusion in the vanilla kernel ;)
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	is there no author mentioned in the patch?
2005-06-16T08:22:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	Didn't spot one
2005-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	Seveas	ABPSoft	then ENOCLUE :)
2005-06-16T08:23:00.000Z	ABPSoft	Seveas	But alas, I didn't read the metadata yet, just ar x'ed the .deb...
