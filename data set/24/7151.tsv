2005-04-13T11:36:00.000Z	Whiffle		i couldn't write one to save my life or the dog i don't have.
2005-04-13T11:37:00.000Z	Whiffle		i ll look into that
2005-04-13T11:37:00.000Z	Whiffle		yeah, thats what I did back in gentoo...cron job with a nasty cp hack onto my spare hd, i'm looking for someting a little more...polished.
2005-04-13T11:37:00.000Z	Whiffle	Nekohayo	did you tell it which directory to look in?
2005-04-13T11:38:00.000Z	Whiffle		nah, just a spare hard drive
2005-04-13T11:39:00.000Z	Whiffle		if it doesn't have a directory to look for pictures in it throws up the test screen
2005-04-13T11:39:00.000Z	locomorto		Does anyone know how to run Selida 2 under wine?
2005-04-13T11:40:00.000Z	Whiffle		yeah really cp would work fine, all i want it to do is copy files onto the other drive and then delete the old stuff for me
2005-04-13T11:40:00.000Z	Whiffle		hmm
2005-04-13T11:41:00.000Z	Whiffle		hmm I'm not sure Nekohayo , I just set xscreensaver to a directory and it went no problem...
2005-04-13T11:42:00.000Z	Whiffle		try hitting the "grab desktop images" box and see if it works with that
2005-04-13T11:44:00.000Z	Whiffle		nah if I move them then I don't have them on the first drive..
2005-04-13T11:44:00.000Z	Whiffle		and since its a backup..
2005-04-13T11:44:00.000Z	locomorto		ln -s /media/windows
2005-04-13T11:45:00.000Z	Whiffle		thats what i do too
2005-04-13T11:45:00.000Z	locomorto		or that
2005-04-13T11:45:00.000Z	Whiffle		although i always screw up the order of the directories a couple of times first ;D
2005-04-13T11:45:00.000Z	locomorto	Whiffle	try using tab to autocomplete it for you
