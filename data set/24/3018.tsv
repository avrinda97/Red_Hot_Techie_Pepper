2008-11-02T10:33:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	doesn't that means it can work if you change the settings with skype somehow? surely someone know
2008-11-02T10:33:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	thus i shall keep repeating :P
2008-11-02T10:33:00.000Z	UserC		My webcam works with Cheese but not with Skype, can anyone help me with that?
2008-11-02T10:33:00.000Z	digitalvectorz		i don't use skype UserC
2008-11-02T10:34:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	the problem is similar
2008-11-02T10:34:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 yar...in Kopete, it auto detects the cam, but it doesn't display an image from the cam..only a frozen, obscure black picture with a horizontal line of static or something
2008-11-02T10:35:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	i just see a weird image i can't describe.. lol
2008-11-02T10:35:00.000Z	digitalvectorz		is it a still pic UserC ?
2008-11-02T10:35:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	no, and my cam turns on
2008-11-02T10:36:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 my cam turns on, it is on...but in the 'configuration' of kopete it just shows a still, distorted pic.  i have no clue the first step in diagnosing webcams
2008-11-02T10:37:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	same here, perhaps you should try using EasyCam 2, it installs cam drivers.. didn't work for me though
2008-11-02T10:37:00.000Z	UserC		My webcam works with Cheese but not with Skype, can anyone help me with that?
2008-11-02T10:38:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 what kind of cam are u using?
2008-11-02T10:38:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	genius videocam eye
2008-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 ah, okay
2008-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	no one is helping me here :P
2008-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 I can see that
2008-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	UserC		My webcam works with Cheese but not with Skype, can anyone help me with that?
2008-11-02T10:39:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	i'll get a better result by spamming and getting kicked
2008-11-02T10:40:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 mine worked before upgrading to 8.10...worked fine.
2008-11-02T10:40:00.000Z	digitalvectorz		go figure
2008-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	maybe that's the problem.. i just installed 8.10, might have been a bad idea.. it still has bugs probably
2008-11-02T10:42:00.000Z	digitalvectorz	UserC	 I wouldn't doubt it.  I just wonder, if it works in Cheese, and has output in /dev/video0, where exactly could it be going wrong with other applications?
2008-11-02T10:43:00.000Z	UserC	digitalvectorz	well.. i just started with ubuntu 2 days ago.. i wonder the same.. lol
