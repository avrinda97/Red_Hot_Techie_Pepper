2007-08-27T07:00:00.000Z	daytona89		is there a bootloader that is an alternative to GRUB? Maybe something graphical/polished?
2007-08-27T07:00:00.000Z	daytona89		GRUB is fugly
2007-08-27T07:01:00.000Z	daytona89		yea, this is true... :)\
2007-08-27T07:01:00.000Z	daytona89		I have 2 choices as to which kernel I want to use. How do I remove the old one?
2007-08-27T07:02:00.000Z	daytona89		Basically I want it to give me a choice of Windows or Ubuntu, not 5 variants of each...
2007-08-27T07:02:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	2.6.20-16 and 2.6.20-15 ?
2007-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	yes, that's right.
2007-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	go into synaptic, search for 2.6.20-15, and uninstall everything that is selected
2007-08-27T07:06:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	just hit search, pick Look in name, and enter 2.6.20-15
2007-08-27T07:08:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	do I remove everything brought up by that search?\
2007-08-27T07:08:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	yes
2007-08-27T07:25:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	2 q's... what's the difference btwn 'remove' and 'completely remove'? & Do I *need* 2.... - 15 at any point down the road?
2007-08-27T07:26:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	completely remove also removes configuration files (like --purge with apt-get), I don't think the kernel has config files but it's safe to completely remove
2007-08-27T07:26:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	you won't need it, -16 was a security update
2007-08-27T07:45:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	you would have to find out about a 3rd party repo that had it... I can't help to think it's not really worth it :p
2007-08-28T10:28:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	ntfsfix in the ntfsprogs package
2007-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	I installed ntfsprogs. How do I use it? It's not in the menu.
2007-08-28T10:30:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	it's command line, you need to unmount the partition then sudo ntfsfix /dev/whatever
2007-08-28T10:32:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	daytona89 from windows
2007-08-28T10:33:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	so... put win on another drive, boot it, and use this one as a slave drive and chkdsk that way?
2007-08-28T10:33:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	why do you have ntfs with no windows?
2007-08-28T10:34:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	my windows partition is ntfs, but it's on the same drive as Ubuntu, and it won't boot. Grub says the partition is not recognized (though it worked yesterday before I installed gfxboot)
2007-08-28T10:35:00.000Z	astro76	daytona89	maybe you can do it from the windows cd
2007-08-28T10:36:00.000Z	daytona89	astro76	I'll give it a shot. Back in a sec.
