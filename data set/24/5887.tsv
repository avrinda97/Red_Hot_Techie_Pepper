2006-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	harisund		??
2006-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	harisund		Copter start typing everything from 'mysql' and avoid the shell> stuff..
2006-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	harisund		and try it again.
2006-08-07T15:48:00.000Z	harisund		Copter did it work

2006-08-07T15:49:00.000Z	harisund		japanese?
2006-08-07T15:50:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	I just had some IRC errors. (sorry) I have modified the smb.conf file as you instructed me.
2006-08-07T15:50:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	Ok . Now restart your samba by doing 'sudo invoke-rc.d samba restart'
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	wait. before that. do 'sudo smbpasswd -a username' where username is the user for which the home directory you want to share. then do the restart command.
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	OK
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	I would suggest you give the same password as the regular user password.
2006-08-07T15:52:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	ok, added the user and restarted samba
2006-08-07T15:52:00.000Z	harisund		ok now try accessing it from your mac miaachine?
2006-08-07T15:55:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	I am not sure this is Mac OS X or Ubuntu, but I get the following (different from before) message: "The operation cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found. (Error code -43)."
2006-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	where do you get that error message?
2006-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	on mac or on Ubuntu?
2006-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	mac
2006-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	if it is on mac, I am guesing you will have to install something on mac before you can access the file.I will have to search google for that.
2006-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	in Windows that is what you are required to do ... so I am not pretty sure ...
2006-08-07T16:00:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	harisund: well, if you would like to, go ahead, but i will search around some more and see if i can find someone who is more familiar with doing this on a mac. don't worry about it. thanks for your help
2006-08-07T16:00:00.000Z	harisund	timothy	ok.. sorry ... but atlesat, it looks like you have all required packages on Ubuntu. Good luck!
2006-08-08T16:02:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	actually, it just worked, but i didn't do anything different except connected to smb://<ip> instead of smb://<ip>/<share folder>
2006-08-08T16:03:00.000Z	timothy	harisund	thank you again for your help
