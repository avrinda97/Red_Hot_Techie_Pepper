2008-08-30T10:02:00.000Z	ganes1		how do i fix problem with usr/lib...
2008-08-30T10:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	what is busted with it?
2008-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	that's not a problem with usr/lib
2008-08-30T10:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	that's a bad programmer who didn't free his memory properly
2008-08-30T10:06:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	Or maybe you compiled it from the source with missing/broken dependencies ?
2008-08-30T10:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	your problem is *** glibc detected *** sifyconnect: double free or corruption (out): 0x0805e1c0 ***
2008-08-30T10:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	meaning the programmer did a free on something that he shouldn't have freed
2008-08-30T10:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	what are you trying to do exactly?
2008-08-30T10:11:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	I understand what that does - why are you doing it?
2008-08-30T10:13:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	times out
2008-08-30T10:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	I cant even connect to that site
2008-08-30T10:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	which means 1 of 2 things
2008-08-30T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	1 I really can't get there or 2: The admins here have blacklisted 202.144.65.70
2008-08-30T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	I really dont know what you downloaded or how you tried to install it
2008-08-30T10:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	generally you download the source, go into its directory and do make config; make; make install
2008-08-30T10:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	no
2008-08-30T10:19:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	did you try the make config - make - make install procedure?
2008-08-30T10:21:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	did you run the install as root?
2008-08-30T10:21:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	incidentally this looks very suspicious, I wouldnt be installing this if I were you
2008-08-30T10:22:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	that doesn't mean it is legit
2008-08-30T10:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	What is this software supposed to do --- maybe there is some alternative?
2008-08-30T10:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	why is that necessary?
2008-08-30T10:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	ok.... ubuntu should be handle all that natively
2008-08-30T10:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ganes1	what kind of weird ISP do you use?
