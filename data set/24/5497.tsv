2006-06-23T07:02:00.000Z	azureal		hi, why does "apt-get install qtparted" fail?
2006-06-23T07:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	what's the error message?
2006-06-23T07:04:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	 E: Couldn't find package qtparted .. i guess apt-get update wasnt enough?
2006-06-23T07:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	dapper/breezy?
2006-06-23T07:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	are you on breezy or dapper?
2006-06-23T07:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	cat /etc/issue if you're not sure
2006-09-18T13:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	re-installing ubuntu-desktop won't change things, it's a metapackage (see the FAQ)
2006-09-18T13:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	what weird errors is vim giving yoou?
2006-10-26T12:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	dmix or xine
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	+ Kawaii-Panda er..  what?!
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	well, if you're using xine on the multiple programs then as I recall they'll all play fine
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	otherwise, you can use dmix with alsa, but it'll take some time to configure.
2006-10-26T12:24:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	i was talking about audio, tho
2006-10-26T12:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	totem plays audio, but other specifically audio apps use xine, too; amarok certainly does. Not sure about other GTK apps though
2006-10-26T12:25:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	the solution involves changing one thing to oss and another to alsa or something... idk what you're talking about...
2006-10-26T12:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	what two apps do you want to give audio output at the same time?
2006-10-26T12:26:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	firefox and beep-media-player
2006-10-26T12:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	your firefox is using totem though, right?
2006-10-26T12:27:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	let's keep it simple -- let's start w/ flash so that we can concentrate on the audio
2006-10-26T12:28:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	beep is based off of xmms
2006-10-26T12:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	actually, have you looked through /msg ubotu sound first?
2006-10-26T12:30:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	oooh, if i run   aoss beep   _and_ aoss firefox it works
2006-10-26T12:32:00.000Z	azureal	apokryphos	sadly aoss firefox makes it really buggy..
2006-10-26T12:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	azureal	how about if you just use aoss with beep?
