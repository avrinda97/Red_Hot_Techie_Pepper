2007-10-05T14:50:00.000Z	Renderbox		nvidia-glx will work for all GeForce cards?
2007-10-05T14:51:00.000Z	Renderbox		Okay, its the mobile version.. for laptops. It should work fine right?
2007-10-05T14:51:00.000Z	Renderbox		Cool
2007-10-05T14:51:00.000Z	Renderbox		:o
2007-10-05T14:52:00.000Z	Renderbox		So should I try it anyway, or stick with the current driver?
2007-10-05T14:53:00.000Z	Renderbox		Well yeah it works.. I couldn't get into the LiveCD normally.. I had to reconfigure xserver-xorg, and choose VESA and all default options.. Thats what I have now
2007-10-05T14:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	Try System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager
2007-10-05T14:54:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	It says my hardware does not require any restricted drivers.
2007-10-05T14:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	I think that means that the nvidia-glx package won't work with your card
2007-10-05T14:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	You can get the newest driver manually, but you will have to re-install it on kernel upgrades
2007-10-05T14:56:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	how do i do that.. re-install it on kernel
2007-10-05T14:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-10-05T14:57:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	It says its advised that xorg works with nv drivers... It didnt work with nv for me
2007-10-05T14:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	ikonia I said that the nvidia-glx package would not work with your card
2007-10-05T15:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	Again, you can get it to work by installing the nvidia.com drivers
2007-10-05T15:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	It's just that you may have a little work to do when you have a kernel update
2007-10-05T15:06:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	Okay, I've bookmarked that link and will try it today. I need to install my WiFi card too, but the instructions given on the forum requires you to download a different kernel. Any other way I could do it?
2007-10-05T15:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	What wifi card?
2007-10-05T15:07:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	Intel Pro 6950 I think.. I forgot the model #, I have to boot into Windows to check
2007-10-05T15:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	Are you on Ubuntu on that box now?
2007-10-05T15:07:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	Yes
2007-10-05T15:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	System -> Preferences -> Hardware Information
2007-10-05T15:10:00.000Z	Renderbox	Jordan_U	I don't see a wireless device listed there
2007-10-05T15:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Renderbox	Strange, I've got to leave, If you can wait 13 days it will probably work with Gutsy :)
