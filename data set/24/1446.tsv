2010-01-12T04:23:00.000Z	captainIan		does anyone have any experiece upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10?  What should I be warry of?
2010-01-12T04:23:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	have you got lots of customizations?
2010-01-12T04:23:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	(non-standard packages, software you compiled yourself, ...)
2010-01-12T04:23:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	no, it's a fresh install AFIK... from netbook
2010-01-12T04:24:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	I upgraded my 9.04 to 9.10 fine on my netbook
2010-01-12T04:24:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	were you using a customized dist or ubuntu eee/easypeasy
2010-01-12T04:24:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	just ubuntu netbook remix
2010-01-12T04:25:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	which is just ubuntu with less packages :)
2010-01-12T04:25:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	how different is it from eeebuntu?
2010-01-12T04:25:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	can't tell. As far as I know, eeebuntu relies on scripts heavily to get stuff done. On ubuntu 9.10 most of the eee functionality works out of the box on my machine (1005HA)
2010-01-12T04:25:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	which I realized after answering your initial q's, is what is on here
2010-01-12T04:26:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	OOTB is why I'm doing it...
2010-01-12T04:26:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	don't know how it works for eeebuntu
2010-01-12T04:26:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	don't know you can upgrade from eeebuntu -> karmic 9.10
2010-01-12T04:26:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	we shal see soon!
2010-01-12T04:26:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	good luck. Sorry, but I don't know a lot about eeebuntu. It's not an official ubuntu derivative, so I don't know how it organises things :)
2010-01-12T04:27:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	i'm only doing it because ubuntu studion iso wouldnt install... it kept peeing on my shoes
2010-01-12T04:27:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	hehe :)
2010-01-12T04:27:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	well, ubuntu studio isn't an official derivate either :)
2010-01-12T04:27:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	it's official enough
2010-01-12T04:31:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	Do you know a quick way to check the dist/version of the system?
2010-01-12T04:31:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	uname -a ?
2010-01-12T04:32:00.000Z	captainIan	forceflow	wow... i feel... new...
2010-01-12T04:32:00.000Z	forceflow	captainIan	you're welcome :)
