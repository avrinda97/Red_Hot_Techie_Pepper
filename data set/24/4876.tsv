2006-12-24T06:50:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	what is the ssh question?
2006-12-24T06:51:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	i would like to set up the machine in front of that i'm sitting to be reachable by my home box by ssh. the thing is this computer here is behind a nat and i can't configure this to forward aport
2006-12-24T06:54:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	you think this is possible?
2006-12-24T06:55:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	you can't forward ports, I think for ssh all you need to forward is 22?
2006-12-24T06:55:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	i can't forward any port
2006-12-24T06:55:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	t make router?
2006-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	i can't access the router here
2006-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	 Ok, you have to set up port forwarding from a box on the other side of the router.
2006-12-24T06:57:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	what do you mean by other side
2006-12-24T06:58:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	 from the side where you _can_ access it from.
2006-12-24T06:59:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	i only can configure my box and this box
2006-12-24T06:59:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	 where is the router?
2006-12-24T07:00:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	 then he has to configure it.
2006-12-24T07:00:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	his uncle wont get out the routerconf pw
2006-12-24T07:00:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	 so your trying to crack it?

2006-12-24T07:03:00.000Z	mc_ren	n2diy	we could only obtain physical violence to his uncle to do this. and since we are friendly guys that only want the for all women and men we won't do so
2006-12-24T07:04:00.000Z	n2diy	mc_ren	What can I say, either way would be illegal.
