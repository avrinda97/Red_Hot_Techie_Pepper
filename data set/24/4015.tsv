2008-05-03T09:30:00.000Z	opop		how can i find a changelog for the new hardy-proposed generic kernel?  I want to see if anything's been done to the rtl8187 driver
2008-05-03T09:31:00.000Z	opop		hai!
2008-05-03T09:31:00.000Z	DanaG	opop	try: aptitude changelog linux-image-2.6.24-17-generic
2008-05-03T09:34:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	i'm sure there is...
2008-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	lemme check...i can't find a compilable version of that driver, however--wondering if i'm missing a library--although i predict it's just crappy code...
2008-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	not that i'm criticizing the devs
2008-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	me too.
2008-05-03T09:36:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	that's the rumor, but there are others out there--nothing on the rtl-wifi forums on compile failure, however (hosted on sf)
2008-05-03T09:37:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	looks like the current rtl-wifi svn tree has something called "rtl8180-migration-for-upstream" and "rtl8180-sa2400-dev", which means to me that it's borked
2008-05-03T09:37:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	based on the fact it's still marked dev
2008-05-03T09:47:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	aw.  that sucks.
2008-05-03T09:47:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	what are you runnin?
2008-05-03T09:47:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	whatever
2008-05-03T09:48:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	why not 64-bit?  working great here, with certain hardware issues
2008-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	not core 2 duo, my bad.
2008-05-03T09:49:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	anywho sorry about your sound.
2008-05-03T09:50:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	emu10k or what?
2008-05-03T09:53:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	ick
2008-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	what sort of video hardware?
2008-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	and are you using a sound server?
2008-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	like esd or anything?
2008-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	any kind of changes change the boot order--it's nuts.
2008-05-03T10:04:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	i noticed that, it was great
2008-05-03T10:06:00.000Z	opop	DanaG	why not install it on a vfat partition
