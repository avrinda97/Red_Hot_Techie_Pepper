2008-09-07T02:42:00.000Z	mojo_		no one else here who plays around with pdfs?
2008-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	What are you trying to do?
2008-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	i want to shrink a pdf
2008-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	Shrink how
2008-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	make the size smaller. from 2,5 mb to 2,0 mb. better 1,9 mb
2008-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	Just print it back as a PDF again - with a lower quality setting
2008-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	where? how? please describe shortly.
2008-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	IE Open it evince and reprint it with the quality setting lower
2008-09-07T02:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	On the job quality tab -- drop the DPI
2008-09-07T02:47:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	yes - the pdf viewer in ubuntu
2008-09-07T02:47:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	I just did it - worked fine - (dropped size by 1/3)
2008-09-07T02:48:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	i already did that several times. the file does not shrink anymore.
2008-09-07T02:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	hrm... have you tried it in Adobe PDF reader?
2008-09-07T02:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	acroread has more printing features to mess with
2008-09-07T02:50:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	can you describe detailed the single steps to print???
2008-09-07T02:51:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	Open PDF in acroread --- File --> Print --> Select PDF as the printer -- change the options as you see fit
2008-09-07T02:51:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	Drop the DPI to 150, do multiple pages per sheet, etc
2008-09-07T02:57:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	strange the resulting file gets bigger!
2008-09-07T02:57:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	heh
2008-09-07T02:57:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	may I ask why you need to shrink the PDF so much -- 2.9 MB or whatever doesnt sound bad at all
2008-09-07T03:01:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	cause the application platform online accepts attachments with max size of 2.0 mb
2008-09-07T03:01:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	So submit fewer pages
2008-09-07T03:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mojo_	or submit it as two separate attachments
2008-09-07T03:03:00.000Z	mojo_	Cpudan80	both solutions not possible.
