2010-11-27T13:57:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		why won't anyone at least try to help me? there's one bum over at #gnome that tried
2010-11-27T13:58:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch	EpicFialGuy	are you using compiz or metacity
2010-11-27T13:58:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		compiz i suppose, let me check my synaptic
2010-11-27T13:58:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		that happened to me once before as well
2010-11-27T13:58:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		I can't remember how I fixed it though
2010-11-27T13:58:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		I'll try to remember
2010-11-27T13:59:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		both are installed
2010-11-27T13:59:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		i'll do what dr willis says, brb
2010-11-27T14:00:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		pidgin isn't shopped with ubuntu anymore is it?
2010-11-27T14:01:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		I thought they switched to empathy
2010-11-27T14:01:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		There is a 3rd party repo for pidgin as well
2010-11-27T14:01:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		DR WILLIS I LOVE YOU
2010-11-27T14:01:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		if you want to the latest builds I guess.
2010-11-27T14:02:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		good job Dr_Willis
2010-11-27T14:04:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		gentlemen, one more question
2010-11-27T14:04:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		pidgin is much better than empathy
2010-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		do you know a way to apply "no special text rendering" rule to every app?
2010-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		because i just love the crisp font used in pre-vista windoses
2010-11-27T14:05:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy		i nearly achieved it in my ubuntu, but it's not globally applied
2010-11-27T14:06:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch	EpicFialGuy	define "no special text rendering"?
2010-11-27T14:06:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy	IrishWristwatch	by default all text in ubuntu is rounded, as if it was anti-aliased
2010-11-27T14:06:00.000Z	IrishWristwatch		if you go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Fonts you can change some system fonts there EpicFialGuy
2010-11-27T14:07:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy	IrishWristwatch	I turned on monochromatic rendering there
2010-11-27T14:07:00.000Z	EpicFialGuy	IrishWristwatch	I want to apply it globally
