2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	zro		... i love when im barking up a totally wrong tree..

2008-07-19T07:09:00.000Z	OpenMindDJ	zro	right now, when i type i hear a beep for every letter i press...what the heck did i just do now!!!
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	zro	OpenMindDJ	 ee.... thats a weird one.
2008-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	zro		Ok,... I got a question, im uploading an inordinate amount of data to a server (using scp). i didnt use the l flag or anything,... the files are going one by one up to the server @ 430KB/s or there abouts... i then started 2 more "scp -Cr " sessions and they are all going @ 430KB/s .... where would one suppose this magical bottle neck is? If I can transfer 3 @ 430, shouldn't one be able to go @ 1290?
2008-07-19T07:11:00.000Z	OpenMindDJ	zro	by the way, pressing the auto button on the monitor seems to clear up the fonts...for some reason this issue was only noticible in FF and well, i read alot of junk about FF3 with fonts....
2008-07-19T07:11:00.000Z	OpenMindDJ		beep beep beep
2008-07-19T07:11:00.000Z	OpenMindDJ		brb
2008-07-19T07:12:00.000Z	OpenMindDJ	zro	beeping gone...thankfully...so anyway..not FF sorry for the bad report on that!
