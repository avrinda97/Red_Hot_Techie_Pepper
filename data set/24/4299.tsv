2007-10-20T09:51:00.000Z	nj786		is the final version of 7.10 out?
2007-10-20T09:53:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	it's not a good idea to upgrade using apt, as the update manager does more than a dist-upgrade using apt would
2007-10-20T09:54:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	ok well can you show me how to do this update please,because i do not know how

2007-10-20T10:00:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	is it ok to update from update manager? if not can you explain why it isnt and what i should do please.
2007-10-20T10:00:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	yes. I thought you were asking for a way to do it from the commandline
2007-10-20T10:00:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	no i was just asking what would be the safest and best option
2007-10-20T10:01:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	are you upgrading from feisty, or from a prerelease of gutsy?
2007-10-20T10:01:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	fiesty
2007-10-20T10:02:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	then the recommended way is on that page I linked to
2007-10-20T10:02:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	can you resend it, and is it a good idea to do it from update manager?

2007-10-20T10:08:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	you will not - it's just like an update, but more complex
2007-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	nj786	Vlet	are you running 7.10?
2007-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	Vlet	nj786	yep
