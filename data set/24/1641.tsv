2011-02-07T14:14:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	well system stuff will be logged. If you want irssi logged let me check on that
2011-02-07T14:14:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	type /help log     in irssi
2011-02-07T14:15:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	yeah change port or reverse connect
2011-02-07T14:20:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	just use irssi itself to config
2011-02-07T14:20:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	type in /help log
2011-02-07T14:22:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	histo	thx sry if i missed that response before

2011-02-07T14:22:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	there are all kinds of loggin options you can see them if you type in /set log    also but /help log is a good start
2011-02-07T14:23:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	histo	rgr that reading it over now
2011-02-07T14:24:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	Yeah i'm going to check it out later as well just for the colorization. I'm to lazy to enable that in irssi
2011-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	histo	strange most of the colors work in irssi default for me .. well atleast system msgs and responses start in yellow names
2011-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	histo	and well seems logging is enabled by default lol
2011-02-07T14:25:00.000Z	histo	Cpt_Zyph	weechat colorizes everything if you look at the screenshots
