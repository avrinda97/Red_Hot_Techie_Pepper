2009-07-28T11:06:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	why are you truying to install version 5.0. I'm guessing that's not the version in the repository. Hence the error
2009-07-28T11:07:00.000Z	Aero231	losher	mysql is in the repository, it always has been
2009-07-28T11:08:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	agreed. But which version is in the repository?
2009-07-28T11:09:00.000Z	Aero231	losher	mysql-server-5.0 is in the repo
2009-07-28T11:09:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	ok, then fix your sources file...
2009-07-28T11:11:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	johnny5_:  so the repository is broken? Unusual, but not unheard of...
2009-07-28T11:13:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	add: deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy main restricted
2009-07-28T11:14:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	and also deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy-updates main restricted
2009-07-28T11:14:00.000Z	Aero231	losher	thanks so much losher, that worked
2009-07-28T11:14:00.000Z	Aero231	losher	How do you know which repos to add?
2009-07-28T11:15:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	I copied them out of my /etc/apt/sources.list, since I'm running hardy too. They should have been put there at install time...
2009-07-28T11:15:00.000Z	Aero231	losher	very strange, maybe because mine is server version
2009-07-28T11:16:00.000Z	losher	Aero231	I can paste mine if you wish. Btw: it's not an xml file, it's place old text...
