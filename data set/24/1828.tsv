2011-09-24T17:29:00.000Z	Dakkus		Hello!
2011-09-24T17:29:00.000Z	Dakkus		Could anyone lend me a helping hand sharing my internet connection wirelessly to my other laptops?
2011-09-24T17:30:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	So you connect through hard wire and want to share wirelessly?
2011-09-24T17:31:00.000Z	Dakkus		I'm connecting through an UMTS modem, but otherwise yes.
2011-09-24T17:31:00.000Z	Dakkus		So, my internet connection's on ppp0.
2011-09-24T17:31:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	On recent versions of ubuntu, simply click on the network/wifi icon in the panel and select create new wireless network
2011-09-24T17:31:00.000Z	Dakkus		That's how I used to do it in the past.
2011-09-24T17:31:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Enter the information and it will create an ad-hoc connection and share it
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	Dakkus		But on this installation that option doesn't exist.
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Which version of ubuntu?
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	Dakkus		This is a 11.04 installed by installing 10.10 and upgrading it right away.
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	Dakkus		(I didn't have any empty CDs around, so this was the least unfeasible way)
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Well you could do it manually with hostapd..
2011-09-24T17:32:00.000Z	Dakkus	soreau	Ok, how?
2011-09-24T17:33:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Very carefully ;)
2011-09-24T17:33:00.000Z	Dakkus		Uh-oh :)
2011-09-24T17:33:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	You will have to do a lot of reading and setup dhcp etc etc
2011-09-24T17:34:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Might even be easier to try and install Natty from a live session
2011-09-24T17:34:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Does wifi work otherwise?
2011-09-24T17:35:00.000Z	Dakkus	soreau	Haha, seems you found my coffee cup holder...
2011-09-24T17:35:00.000Z	Dakkus	soreau	I just switched on the WIFI on this machine, let's see if anything happens ;)
2011-09-24T17:35:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	nice
2011-09-24T17:35:00.000Z	Dakkus		Ok, the menu item's there and I am officially an idiot.
2011-09-24T17:36:00.000Z	soreau	Dakkus	Congrats, you are welcome. Here is your sign ;-)
