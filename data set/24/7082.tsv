2005-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	lsuactiafner	I did it about 20 times.  i even tried sudo before it.
2005-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	BROKEN_LADDER	: linux doesnt continue with pids once you kill -9
2005-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	lsuactiafner	i've used linux off and on for a few years and i've never seen this behavior before.

2005-07-21T06:21:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	BROKEN_LADDER	: make your nick lowercase, also, just download some huge 700mb file from a very fast ftp server and check the speed, kernel.org has a 30mb file you can get.. should give a reasonable benchmark tho
2005-07-21T06:26:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	BROKEN_LADDER	: i pay $75 for a phone line and a 4k/s modem dialup
