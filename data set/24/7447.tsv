2005-11-25T17:53:00.000Z	ajulius		ubuntu is still buggy
2005-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	all distros have bugs.
2005-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	tritium		and all distros always will have bugs
2005-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 when i try to do something i get failed or app crashes, etc...
2005-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 XP pro does a better job with bugs :(
2005-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 hopefully ubuntu will get better next one
2005-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	your problem sounds beyond the OS.  perhaps hardware problems...
2005-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	ajulius		tritium its not hardware............ works fine in xp pro
2005-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	ajulius		its all software
2005-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	but it might not be supported well in linux
2005-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	ajulius		tritium thats possible
2005-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	ajulius		tritum:  Well i have a dell dimension 8300, with radeon video card, nothing out of the ordinary
2005-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	but your experience is far out of the ordinary...very atypical
2005-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	ajulius		tritum:  its an intel chipset, shouldnt any issues
2005-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 I doubt it....... i have multiple machines, and with linux its the same thing with all
2005-11-25T17:56:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	nobody is reporting major issues like those you're having
2005-11-25T17:57:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 I didnt say they were MAJOR
2005-11-25T17:57:00.000Z	ajulius		anyways
2005-11-25T17:57:00.000Z	ajulius		i reported the bugs so hopefully its fixed with the next release
2005-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	which bug #?
2005-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	ajulius		tritium i dont recall offhand
2005-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	since other's aren't experiencing the problem, it's likely unique to your system
2005-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	ajulius	tritium	 Ubuntu is really a work in development tho, always improvements after each release
2005-11-25T17:59:00.000Z	tritium	ajulius	that's not the philosophy for stable releases
