2012-06-01T23:04:00.000Z	bolosaur		fixes the cursor in the first case.
2012-06-01T23:05:00.000Z	bolosaur		If I try to run it as an executable from within Ubuntu's desktop environment however*
2012-06-01T23:06:00.000Z	bolosaur		Just as if I did "bash filename.sh"
2012-06-01T23:06:00.000Z	bolosaur		But again, if I try to run it by double-clicking it it won't fix my cursor problem.
2012-06-01T23:08:00.000Z	bolosaur		Ok, I realized that this is not an Ubuntu problem.
2012-06-01T23:08:00.000Z	bolosaur		Apparently, MOVING the cursor while launching dosbox fixes the cursor problem
2012-06-01T23:08:00.000Z	bolosaur		while letting it be still causes it to occur
2012-06-01T23:08:00.000Z	bolosaur		I must simply have done different mouse movements when doing differnet types of testing
2012-06-01T23:09:00.000Z	bolosaur		Sorry about wasting your time.
2012-06-01T23:09:00.000Z	bolosaur		but thanks for helping
2012-06-01T23:09:00.000Z	asciicmdr	bolosaur	that is very odd.
2012-06-01T23:10:00.000Z	bolosaur		Ugh
2012-06-01T23:11:00.000Z	bolosaur		If I create a link to my script
2012-06-01T23:11:00.000Z	bolosaur		then it once again doesnt work
2012-06-01T23:11:00.000Z	bolosaur		but if i run it within the same location as dosbox
2012-06-01T23:11:00.000Z	bolosaur		then it works
2012-06-01T23:11:00.000Z	bolosaur		ugh im sick of this :/
2012-06-01T23:12:00.000Z	bolosaur		Games and qbasic
2012-06-01T23:12:00.000Z	bolosaur		but i guess linux isnt suited for simple tasks
2012-06-01T23:12:00.000Z	bolosaur		so ill run windows or something instead
2012-06-01T23:13:00.000Z	asciicmdr	bolosaur	what is the variable you are using to fix the cursor issue?
2012-06-01T23:16:00.000Z	bolosaur	asciicmdr	http://lovehateubuntu.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/dosbox-on-ubuntu.html
2012-06-01T23:16:00.000Z	bolosaur		export SDL_VIDEO_X11_DGAMOUSE=0
2012-06-01T23:16:00.000Z	asciicmdr	bolosaur	kk, jsec.
