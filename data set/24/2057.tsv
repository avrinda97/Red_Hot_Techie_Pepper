2010-02-01T09:35:00.000Z	JKemp		Can anyone help? I boot ubuntu to live and get sounds of desktop but no picture.
2010-02-01T09:35:00.000Z	JKemp		Also install gets no picture.
2010-02-01T09:36:00.000Z	JKemp		The menu on first boot with Try without effects to computer, Install, memtst or w/e comes up but everything past leads to no display.
2010-02-01T09:36:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	Which video card ?
2010-02-01T09:36:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	Intel
2010-02-01T09:36:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	Maybe you can try booting with nomodeset as a kernel param to disable kms
2010-02-01T09:37:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	okay, also i get a message when booting Backtrack4 that screens found but none usable so assume its same effect.
2010-02-01T09:38:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	But when i use fixvesa it works in backtrack, but no way to type that in ubuntu since its not non-graphic startup like backtrack.
2010-02-01T09:38:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	If nomodeset doesn't help you can try using the vesa driver
2010-02-01T09:38:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	How would i go about doing that?
2010-02-01T09:38:00.000Z	soreau		ubuntulog: What happens if you run 'fusion-icon' in your terminal?
2010-02-01T09:39:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	Nver had a prob like this b4 :( , lol guess it happens eventually.
2010-02-01T09:40:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	You would have to generate an xorg.conf with 'Xorg -configure' then put the following line in the Device section:  Driver "vesa"
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	Okay where would i use Xorg -configure ? Since its not installed i have no cmd line.
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	btw, after it starts with a black screen, can you do Ctrl+Alt+F# to get to a console?
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	can i use it as a boot parameter?
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp		F#?
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp		Just any number?
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp		Any F# key i guess =P
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	soreau		yes
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	soreau		! tty | JKemp
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	Okay thank you. Later.
2010-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	soreau	JKemp	any number between 1-6
2010-02-01T09:42:00.000Z	JKemp	soreau	Thank you. Will see if it works. =)
