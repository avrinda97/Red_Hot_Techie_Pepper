2007-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	pr0tius	tinman	- I'm looking for my USB hard drive real quick so I can figure out the mount command you need to type.

2007-11-17T16:52:00.000Z	tinman	pr0tius	maybe the fat32 is corrupted or something?
2007-11-17T16:52:00.000Z	pr0tius	tinman	I don't think its corrupted if you can mount it..
