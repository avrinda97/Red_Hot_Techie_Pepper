2008-07-11T02:43:00.000Z	Shady		Looking for help with partitioning a RAID0 drive, I have already tried the FakeRaidHowto and cannot get it to work, i need someone with a workaround please
2008-07-11T02:43:00.000Z	Shady		!FakeRaid
2008-07-11T02:43:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	what type of system is it?
2008-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	I had a problem with a compaq machine with installing a bootloader period.
2008-07-11T02:44:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	hardware
2008-07-11T02:45:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	onboard...cant remember off top of my head
2008-07-11T02:45:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	=/
2008-07-11T02:45:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	does installing linux work period?
2008-07-11T02:47:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	no, i boot from the live CD and it sees the 2 seperate drives, not the RAID, until i load up dmraid and then it sees it BUT, it will not let me resize the partition at all
2008-07-11T02:49:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	uhm, you have a windows partition you want to resize?
2008-07-11T02:50:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	use something like partition magic...and again it may not be possible at all.
2008-07-11T02:50:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	onboard raid controllers and raid controllers which are "soft" raid's (cheap raid controllers) tend to not work very well with linux.
2008-07-11T02:51:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	i did try Partition Manager, and told it to make the proper partitions and upon reboot, it did absolutely nothing
2008-07-11T02:51:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	but there were several people here yesterday saying that it is definitely possible using dmraid and VLM
2008-07-11T02:52:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	if you do a software raid.
2008-07-11T02:52:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	they gave me this info...
2008-07-11T02:54:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	so...perty much ...just do a vanila soft raid
2008-07-11T02:55:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	what is vanilla soft-raid?
2008-07-11T02:56:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	you wouldn't need the fakeraid driver...
2008-07-11T02:57:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	are you referring to dmraid?
2008-07-11T02:57:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	cuz without it ubuntu sees 2 seperate drives instead of the Raid
2008-07-11T02:57:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	because you have no raid volumes.
2008-07-11T02:58:00.000Z	Shady	sipher_	how do you mean no Raid volumes? i guess i dont understand because i have dual 250gb drives in a Raid0
2008-07-11T03:02:00.000Z	sipher_	Shady	ya?
