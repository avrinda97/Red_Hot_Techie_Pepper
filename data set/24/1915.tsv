2009-09-11T19:15:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	Gparted allows resizing partitions without destroying data in its regular process. Of course you should still back up your data "just in case". Do you have an Ubuntu live CD or did you install it from the 'alternate'?
2009-09-11T19:16:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	You can boot your comp into live mode ("test Ubuntu without changing anything") and run gparted from there. I'm not sure if it's working from the OS on the harddrive
2009-09-11T19:17:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	That depends on what you set to be smaller :p
2009-09-11T19:25:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	check your PMs
2009-09-11T19:27:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	/away
2009-09-11T19:27:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	Have you tried running gparted yet? It's quite straight-forward
2009-09-11T19:28:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	You can try changing your setup without actually changing anything to get a feeling for it
2009-09-11T19:30:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	You see the names on the bars representing the partitions, right? I'll boot into the live cd, too
2009-09-11T19:35:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	have you tried rightclicking on /dev/sda1 in gparted and the "
2009-09-11T19:35:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	"Size/Remove"?
2009-09-11T19:36:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	Resize/Move, of course
2009-09-11T19:36:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	then there's the dialog. You cannot make it bigger from here, I suspect since another partition ought to start right thereafter
2009-09-11T19:37:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	what do you mean?
2009-09-11T19:39:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	Are you using Ubuntu as LiveCD?
2009-09-11T19:40:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	If not, make sure you are running gparted with root rights and that you do have selected the right partition. How does it look for you? Here's a screenshot of my gparted: http://i25.tinypic.com/euilao.gif
2009-09-11T19:43:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	it shouldn't be. Which Ubuntu did you say you were using?
2009-09-11T19:44:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	nfts support has long been a part. It's only the other way round that windos can't read ext
2009-09-11T19:45:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	show it
2009-09-11T19:45:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	oh. press the [PrtScr] key on your keyboard and gnome-screenshot should offer you a dialogue. You can try.
2009-09-11T19:48:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	if you can't dcc, just upload it to tinypic or some image hoster
2009-09-11T19:49:00.000Z	lb_	yinlong	this is how gparted could look like after some changes: http://img5.yfrog.com/img5/3051/vm2r.gif
