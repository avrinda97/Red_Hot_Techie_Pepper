2007-03-18T06:31:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	how did you change them
2007-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	ravi	ikonia	was following this guide: http://www.taimila.com/ubuntuosx.php

2007-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	777 is NOT
2007-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	 that changes the group too
2007-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	he said just the user - not a group
2007-03-18T06:38:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	/msg
2007-03-18T06:43:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	undo the guide you followed
2007-03-18T06:56:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	undo what you have done - for the last time
2007-03-18T06:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	yes it is
2007-03-18T07:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	sounds like it may be easier to install
2007-03-18T07:06:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	why not what ?
2007-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	because if you don't know what you're doing it can wreck your whole system
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	what makes you think its noapci ?
2007-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	don't make random guesses with the kernel
2007-03-18T07:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	not its not - it changes the way your kernel deals with apci requests
2007-03-18T07:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ravi	that is a reasonable deal
