2012-08-08T11:46:00.000Z	cronie2285		anyone know why my 32bit OS won't start up on my new 64bit motherboard? It gets to grub then just reboots.
2012-08-08T11:46:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	you check your grub install?
2012-08-08T11:47:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	yeah, do I need some param?
2012-08-08T11:48:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	i think it's like F8 or one of those that allows you to select what kernel you boot into
2012-08-08T11:48:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	have you tried the failsafe?
2012-08-08T11:49:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	no failsafe option, It's a ferdoa OS
2012-08-08T11:49:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	hmm let me look around
2012-08-08T11:49:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	thanks
2012-08-08T11:50:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	did this happen after an update?
2012-08-08T11:51:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	no I just got the new MB, and now I would like to do dual boot with both OS's
2012-08-08T11:51:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	have a look at this http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/14/html/Installation_Guide/ap-rescuemode.html
2012-08-08T11:51:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	K, thanks alot
2012-08-08T11:53:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	neither, I got two drives, but if I select the fedora one it just don't boot on this new 64 bit MB.
2012-08-08T11:54:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	so these OS's were installed before you put in the new mobo?
2012-08-08T11:54:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	that could be a problem..not for sure..but it may be
2012-08-08T11:55:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	the old mobo was an ausu too, but was a 32bit dual XEON processors.
2012-08-08T11:58:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	it's like how when you have a copy of windows on a hardrive, and you replace the motherboard that is totally different. The windows install panics, and you have to re-install
2012-08-08T11:58:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	this maybe the case with linux
2012-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	the new mobo is just the 64bit AMD FX series, and I just thought it should boot the 32 bit OS no problem, but it get up to Grub then just reboots again.
2012-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	that grub install might possibly be seeing a configuration for the old motherboard, and not seeing the new one
2012-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	you may have to re-install grub on the MBR of that drive
2012-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	you are probably 100% ritght.
2012-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	cronie2285	chuck	thanks for your help, I guess Im going to have to learn grub.conf options.
2012-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	chuck	cronie2285	anytime, good luck
