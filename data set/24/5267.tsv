2006-09-01T09:12:00.000Z	amatiel		i'm having trouble preparing my partitions; I have about 10gb free but it's not letting me resize. it says fat32 partition.
2006-09-01T09:13:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	what i'd do is use gparted.
2006-09-01T09:14:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	how do i do that?
2006-09-01T09:14:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	look in google for gparted,download live cd,burn it and make use of it ;)
2006-09-01T09:14:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	thanks!
2006-09-01T09:15:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	this tool is awesome,so far it managed to do everything that's physically possible with parition table ;d
2006-09-01T09:37:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	I tried what you sad,d he problem was the same
2006-09-01T09:38:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	And the problem was the same
2006-09-01T09:39:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	what was the problem?
2006-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	It won't let me resize my fat32 partition that I have winME on.
2006-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	gparted was the same
2006-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	ah damn,what error they output?
2006-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	No error. All of the options to make the free space larger are greyed out.
2006-09-01T09:41:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	what you mean? how you wanted to make it larger?
2006-09-01T09:42:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	I wanted to make the fat32 partition smaller so I could install ubuntu
2006-09-01T09:42:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	and resize doesn't work?
2006-09-01T09:43:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	^
2006-09-01T09:44:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	none of windows-native resizing tools work?
2006-09-01T09:44:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	Didn't try them.
2006-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	I didn't realise windows ME had one.
2006-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	But somehow I doubt that
2006-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	you may always download few ;)
2006-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	amatiel	DeeTahPanLtah	gparted did not work, the installcd did not work... perhaps the problem is elsewhere than the software?
2006-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	DeeTahPanLtah	amatiel	they are somewhat similar,try windows-based tools like partitionmagic
