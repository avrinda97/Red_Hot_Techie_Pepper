2008-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	what do you mean
2008-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	I mean what I said. Can you be more specific.
2008-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	Specific about my problem?  What do you mean you called alsamixer
2008-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	tony__		I only have two options in alsamixer
2008-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	tony__		Master and PCM
2008-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	tony__		Shouldn't I have more?

2008-02-26T12:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	alsamixer is a program available in Ubuntu. Just enter 'alsamixer' in a Gnome terminal. It allows you to set many ALSA controls.
2008-02-26T12:31:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	I did, I only have two things I can change in it though
2008-02-26T12:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	man alsamixer will tell you what control settings you can change. --  I am surprised to read that you can change only two control settings.
2008-02-26T12:38:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	I only have Master and PCM
2008-02-26T12:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	There are two Web documents that I can recommend in your situation: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Soundkarten_installieren/HDA

2008-02-26T12:43:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	I don't speak german
2008-02-26T12:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Soundprobleme/Audio-Fehler-Beschreibung. But they are in German.
2008-02-26T12:44:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	I do not know if there exist English equivalents. Sorry.
2008-02-26T12:45:00.000Z	tony__	bullgard4	It's all good, I really should be getting some sleep now anyway.  I'll mess with it tomorrow
2008-02-26T12:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	tony__	Good luck!
