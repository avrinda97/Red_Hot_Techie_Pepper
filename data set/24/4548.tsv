2007-10-18T08:19:00.000Z	noooby		i just installed gutsy rc1. I tried to activaet compiz-fusion through system>preferences>appearance but it says "composite extension not available" do i have to download another package"? i thought it was supported by default?
2007-10-18T08:19:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	what gfx card?
2007-10-18T08:20:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	radeon x600 (with restricted drivers installed)
2007-10-18T08:22:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	your card's been blacklisted because there are issues with it and compiz-fusion. i cannot tell you what those issues are. we can override the blacklist, but i can't promise your system will be stable.  do you want to proceed?
2007-10-18T08:23:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	yes i do. can u lead me to the how-to or tell me how
2007-10-18T08:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	open up a terminal, type the following without quotes ... "echo SKIP_CHECKS=yes >> ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager"
2007-10-18T08:26:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	that's it and it'll work?
2007-10-18T08:27:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	should. ALT + F2 and type compiz --replace when you've done it. you might need to alt ctrl bkspc out of x, but i think the first will work alright
2007-10-18T08:27:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	thank you. after the skip-check thing, i can use compiz like normal like every1 else w/ ccsm?
2007-10-18T08:28:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	should be able to
2007-10-18T08:32:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	i don't have a /.config/compiz folder
2007-10-18T08:33:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	that's bizarre. are you actually looking for the folder, or did you get an error message with that command?
2007-10-18T08:35:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	i was looking for that folder to get into in the terminal so i could enter the command and coudln't find it. my /.config folder just has gtk-2.0, tracker, and user-dirs.dirs, and user-dirs.locale
2007-10-18T08:37:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	in that case, i dont know what to tell you :|
2007-10-18T08:41:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	since i was blacklisted, do i need to install the compiz-fusion packages? is that why i don't have those folders? or am i looking in the wrong place
2007-10-18T08:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	i really dont know. my card was blacklisted, and i used the command to override, and had no issues at all. did effects /ever/ work for you under 7.10? [maybe they put the blacklist into the actual installation after i'd gotten the disc. mine worked out of the box, but were killed with an upgrade]
2007-10-18T08:45:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	i just got 7.10 upgraded like 20 min. ago and the first thing i did was try to get the effects to work.
2007-10-18T08:46:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	in a term, type apt-cache policy compiz
2007-10-18T08:46:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	let me know if its installed or not
2007-10-18T08:47:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	it says "Installed" with a bunch of stuff and then "Candidate" under w/ a bunch of stuff
2007-10-18T08:49:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	what driver are you using at the moment?
2007-10-18T08:49:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	how do i figure that out? i just clicked inside the "restricted driver's" management thing and enabled the restrcited driver
2007-10-18T08:50:00.000Z	riotkittie	noooby	ah ha. i should have thought to ask that sooner :|  i think you have to install other packages to use it with the restricted driver but i'm not sure what they are :|
2007-10-18T08:51:00.000Z	noooby	riotkittie	o0o0 ok thanks .. i'll go look for it =)
