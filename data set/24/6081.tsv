2006-03-24T14:25:00.000Z	wd3		need help installing conky......see pastebin http://pastebin.com/611226
2006-03-24T14:26:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	why install from source?
2006-03-24T14:27:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	not sure, newbie how should i install?
2006-03-24T14:27:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	you should install the conky package...
2006-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	/ lamego didn't know conky was there
2006-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	most stuff is.  conky's in universe; do you have it enabled?
2006-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	/ lamego is installing tz.gar files this hard?
2006-03-24T14:28:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	yes
2006-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	i just don't think it's worth it.  i'd be using a different distro if i did.
2006-03-24T14:29:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	what's not worth it
2006-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	you can also search in synaptic, if you'd prefer a GUI.  i don't think compiling/installing from source is worth it for everyday use.  i can do it, but packages are the way to go in most cases.
2006-03-24T14:30:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	especially when you're new, it's not worth the time and effort; it's kind of a steep learning curve.
2006-03-24T14:31:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	thanks  is this right   rm /conky
2006-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	it's in my home folder, what shall i do (rm /conky)
2006-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	delete in the GUI... open your home folder and delete the directory.  if you insist on using rm at the command line, read the manpage for a good learning experience.  (hint: you want it to recurse into that folder.)
2006-03-24T14:32:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	Places menu > Home
2006-03-24T14:33:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	? recurse into that folder?
2006-03-24T14:34:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	'rm -r ./conky' would do it
2006-03-24T14:35:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	but there is a bit of knowledge in that command... knowing -r, knowing that ./ is the current directory.  all things that will come in time, if you want to learn.
2006-03-24T14:36:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	i use to use dos, this sounds sort of familiar. the man pages are manuals right, i bought a "linux for dummies" but still confusing.
2006-03-24T14:37:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	yes... manuals.  'man rm' will give you all the options for the rm command, sort of like 'del /?' would give in DOS.  only better. :-P
2006-03-24T14:38:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	thanks ur ok...i'm dual booting and haven't touched xp in a week, still having withdrawals though  he he he
2006-03-24T14:43:00.000Z	wd3	andrewski	i installed automatix and all the video and audio and some other stuff now my system is slow why. i have a 30 g. win on 10g, ununtu 10g and 10free how can i make the 10 free for ubuntu?
2006-03-24T14:43:00.000Z	andrewski	wd3	just ask; no need to target me.
