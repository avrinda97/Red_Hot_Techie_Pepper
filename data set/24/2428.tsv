2008-12-22T09:51:00.000Z	Unr3a1		I need help with something
2008-12-22T09:51:00.000Z	Unr3a1		I just purchased a Lenovo S10 Netbook and installed Intrepid on it
2008-12-22T09:51:00.000Z	Unr3a1		and apt-get is unable to find any of the packages
2008-12-22T09:51:00.000Z	Unr3a1		xchat, thunderbird, wireshark.. anything
2008-12-22T09:52:00.000Z	Unr3a1		it says it cannot find the package
2008-12-22T09:52:00.000Z	Unr3a1		does anyone know why this would happen?
2008-12-22T09:53:00.000Z	Unr3a1		nobody?
2008-12-22T09:54:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	I lost you because your post wasn't a single one
2008-12-22T09:55:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	Have you run 'sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade' yet?
2008-12-22T09:55:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	no I have not.  I am doing an upgrade through the update manager right now.
2008-12-22T10:00:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	thank you for your input as well... it is much appreciated
2008-12-22T10:01:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	No problem. Repositories are very important. apt-get update should always work without errors
2008-12-22T10:11:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	Very possible
2008-12-22T10:12:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	we'll see what happens.
2008-12-22T10:12:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	I guess you will ;)
2008-12-22T10:33:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	apt-get works now, but shutdown doesn't
2008-12-22T10:33:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	That's unfortunate
2008-12-22T10:35:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	yea.  I guess I will have to just deal with it, and use init
2008-12-22T10:38:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	alright, well, thank you for all the info.  I really appreciate it
2008-12-22T10:39:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	Wish I could help more :)
2008-12-22T10:39:00.000Z	Unr3a1	soreau	hey, its no problem.  dont worry about it.  its not as if I am unable to shutdown the computer at all
2008-12-22T10:40:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	Yea, here's another one I like: sudo shutdown -h now
2008-12-22T10:48:00.000Z	soreau	Unr3a1	Hhere's another one I like: sudo shutdown -h now
