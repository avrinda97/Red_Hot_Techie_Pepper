2010-09-03T17:05:00.000Z	iluminator101		How do i create a laucher to access my private? Because currently I have to do cd $Home and ecryptfs-mount-private after i log in
2010-09-03T17:06:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	I think that hidden file that's in Private before you mount it tells you how, does it?
2010-09-03T17:07:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	what you mean?'
2010-09-03T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	is your private directory mounted now?
2010-09-03T17:08:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	yea
2010-09-03T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	can you unmount it?
2010-09-03T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	ok, and then what do you see inside it using a terminal?
2010-09-03T17:11:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	inside what?
2010-09-03T17:11:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	the private directory
2010-09-03T17:12:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	can you paste what the instructions on yours, mine is messed up
2010-09-03T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	I don't have ecryptfs installed here
2010-09-03T17:15:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	is this right ln -s /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-/home/iluminator101/Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop
2010-09-03T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	probably not.  Look slike you need a space
2010-09-09T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	well is it...
2010-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	i am trying to copy /etc to /dev/sdb1/hp2back2/etc1
2010-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	I saw.  What did the error tell you?  Check if the error is lying to you or not.
2010-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	etc1 is a folder
2010-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	ls -ld /dev/sdb1/hp2backup2/etc1
2010-09-09T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	wait, why /dev???
2010-09-09T05:06:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	its an external harddrive
2010-09-09T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	you don't access it through /dev.   You mount it somewhere
2010-09-09T05:12:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	why not a directory error i am following at all
2010-09-09T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	iluminator101	doesn't matter, did you see what I told you about mounting?
2010-09-09T05:14:00.000Z	iluminator101	jrib	cp -R /etc/* /media/Expansion drive same error why
