2007-08-14T12:19:00.000Z	Bllz		hey guys. quick question.  I'm going to reinstall ubuntu and i was wondering what the recommended partition setup was?
2007-08-14T12:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	the default one that the installer creates.
2007-08-14T12:19:00.000Z	Bllz		just looking for input really...
2007-08-14T12:20:00.000Z	Bllz	fyrestrtr	what about making the /home part separate?
2007-08-14T12:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	that is up to you; how you want to set it up.
2007-08-14T12:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	but for 99% of people, the default setup suffices.
2007-08-14T12:21:00.000Z	Bllz	fyrestrtr	 okay.  The thing is the default gives me WAAAY too much swap space, so maybe i'll just go ahead and do it manually.  There's no major advantage to separating / and /home?
2007-08-14T12:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr		the major advantage is that if you ever hose up your system, your personal files will remain safe should you re-install.
2007-08-14T12:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	how much ram do you have?
2007-08-14T12:22:00.000Z	Bllz		jordan_u:  okay so if i want to separate them i just define the mount points as / and /home respectively?
2007-08-14T12:22:00.000Z	Bllz	fyrestrtr	 3gb
2007-08-14T12:22:00.000Z	Bllz		and it gives me 6 gb of swap... way too much
2007-08-14T12:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	laptop?
2007-08-14T12:23:00.000Z	Bllz		desktop
2007-08-14T12:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	if you want to hibernate, then you need large amounts of swap -- also, if you plan to install oracle and some other apps, they require a set amount of *swap* (in addition to the memory requirement)
2007-08-14T12:24:00.000Z	Bllz	fyrestrtr	 I was thinking of just giving myself like 512 mb of swap... i feel like that's more than enough?  And seeing as i dont even know what oracle is, lol, i think i should be okay
2007-08-14T12:24:00.000Z	Bllz		what do you think?
2007-08-14T12:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	stick with 1GB
2007-08-14T12:24:00.000Z	Bllz		kk will do
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	Bllz	fyrestrtr	 one more question.  if i do a separate / and /home, will my desktop be on the / or /home partition?
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	Bllz		and is it / or \?
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	/home
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	Bllz		okay. thanks a lot guys!
2007-08-14T12:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Bllz	desktop is /home/yourusername/Desktop
