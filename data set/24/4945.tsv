2006-12-06T06:27:00.000Z	vyamba		I am having problems with Gnome after updating to edgy. everything starts up nicely
2006-12-06T06:28:00.000Z	vyamba		but when i launch any windows, the are stuck on the top left corner of screen and there is no resize buttons
2006-12-06T06:28:00.000Z	vyamba		i also can't resize windows
2006-12-06T06:28:00.000Z	pty	vyamba	do the windwos have borders?
2006-12-06T06:28:00.000Z	vyamba		no they don't
2006-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	pty	vyamba	press alt+f2 and launch a gnome-terminal
2006-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	vyamba	pty	alt-f2 not getting me anything
2006-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	vyamba		i can switch between windows or work spaces either
2006-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	pty	vyamba	does your applications menu work?

2006-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	vyamba		application menus work as well
2006-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	pty	vyamba	ok - open one and type 'metacity'  in
2006-12-06T06:31:00.000Z	pty		lol soundray; have come across this enough times from my compiz/beryl episodes
2006-12-06T06:31:00.000Z	vyamba	pty	i've got my borders after running metacity
2006-12-06T06:31:00.000Z	vyamba		everything seems to be working fine now

2006-12-06T06:31:00.000Z	pty	vyamba	no problem.  does it do it every time you boot up?
