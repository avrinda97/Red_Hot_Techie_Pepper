2012-01-15T22:49:00.000Z	shadaloo		why was "updatedb" removed and what does ubuntu use to manage files?
2012-01-15T22:50:00.000Z	shadaloo		!search | shadaloo
2012-01-15T22:51:00.000Z	shadaloo		what is the fastest way to search every file?
2012-01-15T22:51:00.000Z	shadaloo		does ubuntu contain a database of every file
2012-01-15T22:51:00.000Z	shadaloo		but I want to make sure I look everywhere in userspace
2012-01-15T22:52:00.000Z	shadaloo		~/
2012-01-15T22:52:00.000Z	shadaloo		I used to use updatedb
2012-01-15T22:52:00.000Z	shadaloo		and it made searching take seconds
2012-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	shadaloo		how do I search recursive
2012-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	shadaloo		with locate
2012-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	it's recursive by default, but it needs updatedb to be run first
2012-01-15T22:54:00.000Z	shadaloo	LjL	I will give it another go
2012-01-15T22:55:00.000Z	shadaloo	LjL	do I need to run updatedb as sudo?
2012-01-15T22:55:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	i believe so
2012-01-15T22:55:00.000Z	shadaloo	LjL	I did that and it didn't locate recursively
2012-01-15T22:55:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	uh, i dunno, it searches recursively for me.
2012-01-15T22:56:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	what are you typing exactly?
2012-01-15T22:58:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	have you made sure updatedb was run?
2012-01-15T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	"locate <name of search>"?
2012-01-15T23:07:00.000Z	shadaloo	LjL	dude, we've been through this
2012-01-15T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	yes, and it works just fine here. so that's the better way. it's apparently just broken for you.
2012-01-15T23:08:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	it's possible GNOME also comes with something to search with indexing, but i'm not familiar with that stuff.
2012-01-24T22:39:00.000Z	LjL	shadaloo	to remove the actual packages installed, "sudo apt-get remove packagename". to remove the repo, delete the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2012-01-24T22:40:00.000Z	shadaloo	LjL	I see, the .d is new to me
