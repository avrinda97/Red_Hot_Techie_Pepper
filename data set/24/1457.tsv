2010-02-27T05:13:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	type echo $CATALINA_HOME
2010-02-27T05:10:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	adding 'export VAR=value' to your .bashrc is one way....
2010-02-27T05:10:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	thank you... do i have to add it just at the end of that file
2010-02-27T05:11:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	the end of the file is a good location usually. You may have to logout and then back in again for it to take effect, ok
2010-02-27T05:12:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	i did that export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat
2010-02-27T05:12:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	looks good. Did it work?
2010-02-27T05:13:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	how do i check it ??
2010-02-27T05:13:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	because  it i try to install something which requires that stuff it says "nstallation requires the CATALINA_HOME environment variable to be set to the location of your Tomcat installation."
2010-02-27T05:14:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	the output is /opt/tomcat
2010-02-27T05:14:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	perfect, that should do it...
2010-02-27T05:15:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	but when i try to install something which requires that.. it says that the environment variable is not set
2010-02-27T05:15:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	did you logout and back in again?
2010-02-27T05:16:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	couple of times
2010-02-27T05:16:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	are your sure the /opt/tomcat is the correct value?
2010-02-27T05:17:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	pretty sure... if i go to cd /opt/tomcat i can see my tomcat folder ( i did an ln -s
2010-02-27T05:17:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	where did you link it to?
2010-02-27T05:18:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	ln -s apache-tomcat-6.0.24 tomcat
2010-02-27T05:20:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	well, nothing to lose, so try export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/apache-tomcat-6.0.24 instead...
2010-02-27T05:20:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	ok i will thank you
2010-02-27T05:21:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	i need to log out now don't i
2010-02-27T05:22:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	yes, then use the echo command to check that the variable is there...
2010-02-27T05:25:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	i tried to install that again... and it dosn't work.. stil the same error message
2010-02-27T05:26:00.000Z	Losha	Kismet	sorry, I'm out of ideas then....
2010-02-27T05:26:00.000Z	Kismet	Losha	still thank you for your time...
