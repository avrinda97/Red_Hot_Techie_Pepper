2008-12-30T02:29:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	what is your problem?
2008-12-30T02:36:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	Do you have autologin enabled?
2008-12-30T02:37:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	ok. If you had autologin disabled, the keyring would have been unlocked automatically. Let me look for a solution for your problem, a moment please.
2008-12-30T02:39:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	does the "unlock keyring" dialog that is displayed show a check box for "always unlock when computer is started" or similar? Or does the dialog only have a field to enter the password and ok/cancel buttons?
2008-12-30T02:41:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	hm.
2008-12-30T02:45:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	well, I found this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/140755, but its with this check box. hm
2008-12-30T02:47:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	but anyway that bug is fixed.
2008-12-30T02:48:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	you still there?
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	but: it involves setting the keyring password to blank
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	that means, your saved passwords (like wlan) will be saved unencrypted
2008-12-30T02:54:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	you have to be aware that that is a security issue.
2008-12-30T02:56:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	yes, but exactly that wlan key won't be stored encrypted ... otherwise you would need some sort of password to unlock it.
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	ok, I talked enough, lets get to the solution. Open Applications->Accessories->Passwords and Encryption Keys
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	select Edit->Preferences
2008-12-30T02:57:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	click on the keyring "login" and choose the button "change Unlcok Password"
2008-12-30T02:58:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	 ok?
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	now, enter your password in the "old password" field and click change, without entering a new password.
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	probably a warning will occur, that this is insecure.
2008-12-30T02:59:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	yeah, so just click "ok" in that warning.
2008-12-30T03:00:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	ok, you're all set now. no passwords anymore
2008-12-30T03:01:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	but remember: everybody with access to your files can also read your saved passwords (that are saved in the keyring), like your wlan password. Glad to have helped, zoed
2008-12-30T03:03:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	theoretically, yes. But, there is no possibility of automatically connecting to wlan without entering a password sometime (during login, keyring unlock...)
2008-12-30T03:04:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	ok, although I prob wont be here anymore... But its gonna work, every bet.
2008-12-30T03:05:00.000Z	homy	Andrew1	you're welcome.
