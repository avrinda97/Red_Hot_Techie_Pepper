2008-04-01T06:47:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	hey, this is Azure Tide from yesterday, I'm running 7.10 smoothly on my laptop now, I usedd the terminal to run that lspci thing you said yesterday
2008-04-01T06:47:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	and it says Atheros AR5006EG
2008-04-01T06:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	you wired? and want to get wireless going?
2008-04-01T06:49:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	yes sir
2008-04-01T06:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	open a terminal and see if ifconfig shows more than eth0 and lo (ie ath0 or the like)
2008-04-01T06:51:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	it only has those two, but there are alot of lines for them
2008-04-01T07:00:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	so i only have Eth0 and Lo in the ifconfig
2008-04-01T07:13:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	its only Eth0 and Lo when I use ifconfig
2008-04-01T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	is there a sticker on the bottom of the laptop?
2008-04-01T07:15:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	yes there are a few of them, is there somethig I need to look for?
2008-04-01T07:17:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	i don't see that sticker on the bottom
2008-04-01T07:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	what about lspci -nn what does that show--168c:001c?
2008-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	yes
2008-04-01T07:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	then that is the 5007 not the 5006 just a second
2008-04-01T07:23:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	why would it say "AR5006EG" but have 168c:001c?
2008-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	the madwifi drivers support that card; the reason for it being listed as 5006 in ubuntu may be a problem with ubuntu not searching for subsection ids (or so I've read)
2008-04-01T07:30:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	ok thank you
2008-04-01T07:36:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	it says to inter the 7.10 gusty gibbon disk release i386
2008-04-01T07:36:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	is that my livecd?
2008-04-01T07:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	yes
2008-04-01T07:49:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	thank you, I'm wireless again ^^with my hour or so of using linux, i'm already head over heals for it :D
2008-04-01T07:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Azur3	wow that was fast; you did all that yourself? congrats!
2008-04-01T07:51:00.000Z	Azur3	bazhang	thanks, I'll prolly hang around this channel to see what else I can learn about linux, do you have any sites I should read about the basics?
