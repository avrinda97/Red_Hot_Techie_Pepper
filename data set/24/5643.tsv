2006-06-01T09:06:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee		...of Ubuntu (LiveCD). I launched the install from there, but it took like 5 minutes just to show the first Installer Window. That's unacceptable. Fedora Core 5 installed in 20 minutes and Ubuntu could take forever to install that way. I tried to install it on 2 machines with 256MB of RAM. Text based install is not an option if we want to show Ubuntu to the others. SEE? I hope I was clear now
2006-06-01T09:06:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	there's an alternative install image that does a text mode install
2006-06-01T09:07:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	the new default one is aimed at more modern desktop machines really and lets people try it out before they install
2006-06-01T09:07:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	I just did
2006-06-01T09:09:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	Have you read what I've said about FC 5
2006-06-01T09:09:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	yes, did you read what I replied with? Grab the alternate install image and you will be able to do an install in under half an hour on a reasonably capable machine
2006-06-01T09:11:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	thanks for your reply, but as I said, I can't do that with people who want an easy install
2006-06-01T09:11:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	the text installer is easy
2006-06-01T09:11:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	What is so hard to understand?
2006-06-01T09:12:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	I'm just telling you how it is, if you don't like it there's really not much I can do about it. Either give them the desktop installer and they can try ubuntu out and use the graphical installer, or give them the alternate one if they have a low RAM/CPU machine
2006-06-01T09:12:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	what's so difficult to install about that to understand?
2006-06-01T09:13:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	I installed a p4 with 512mb of ram in way under an hour with the graphical ubuntu installer this morning
2006-06-01T09:13:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	OR give them Desktop CD and the option to install it without a try
2006-06-01T09:14:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	I'm not familiar with the internals of how the disc works, so i can't answer that, but even if I could it's irrelevant because it was released today and won't be updated until the next release. If you would like to participate in that, please go to launchpad.net and write a spec/wishlist about it
2006-06-01T09:14:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	this is a support channel, not a place to rant about things you don't like. sorry.
2006-06-01T09:17:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	sorry for not understanding what I say. I want all the best to Ubuntu. And I will install it on MY PC which has 1GB RAM. But as far as the major distributions have the ability to install directly AND grap
2006-06-05T16:30:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	Hi!
2006-06-05T16:31:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	One question for you, if you have a little time, please
2006-06-05T16:31:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	just ask, if someone can help you, they will
2006-06-05T16:43:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	As it seems that nobody answers, it remains to me to present here the problem. I created the power user (sudoer), then a normal user. From my first account I switched (with the switch user button) to the normal account. From the normal account I chose log off and there was the problem: The greeter failed to show 6 times. After 6 times a message shows in text mode (very wired characters),...
2006-06-05T16:45:00.000Z	Ng	ubuntuNewbee	hmm, I've not come across that before. Perhaps check /var/log/Xorg.* for errors?
2006-06-05T16:46:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	but have you used that functionality before?
2006-06-05T16:56:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	Are you there?
2006-06-05T16:59:00.000Z	ubuntuNewbee	Ng	When you have time, please test that thing out. The problem is consistent. It keeps showing
