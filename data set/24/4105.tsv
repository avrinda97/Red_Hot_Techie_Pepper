2007-08-05T05:49:00.000Z	amidaniel		And possibly reinstall nautilus
2007-08-05T05:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	afaik nautilus gets it's info from gnome-vfs
2007-08-05T05:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	actually nautilus is mostly a GUI around gnome-vfs :)
2007-08-05T05:50:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	O rly? Hmm .. news to me :)
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	Gecko 1.9's rendering system has basically been completely redone
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Having talked with some of the devs, the only thing I've heard that's really "improved" in FF3 is that tooltips can now be longer :)
2007-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	dude, frame display lists and cairo-based rendering
2007-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Hrm .. I haven't followed it that closely, but I certainly haven't heard of anything magnificient being done
2007-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	'best release ever'
2007-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	well, until Gecko 2.0
2007-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	in my opinion so much has changed in 1.9 it really should have been called 2.0
2007-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	but for 2.0 they're being even more ambitious
2007-08-05T05:57:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Really? Well, you've tempted me .. I'm going to have to try it out :)
2007-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	Language, please.
2007-08-05T06:01:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Gahh .. sorry :)
2007-08-05T06:02:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	What rules do we go by with language? MPAA? :)
2007-08-05T06:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	'family friendly'
2007-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	i learned all i know from http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Command_Line :)
2007-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Haha :)
2007-12-02T18:10:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	A +r and a +J 7,1 (or more restrivtive) would likely help
2007-12-02T18:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	+J blocks regular users way too much, same with +r
2007-12-02T18:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	So we only set +r during an attack
2007-12-02T18:11:00.000Z	amidaniel	Amaranth	Well, you certainly need *some* join throttle
2007-12-02T18:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	amidaniel	We have it, FloodBot
