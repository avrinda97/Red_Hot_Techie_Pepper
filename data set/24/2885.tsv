2008-12-28T12:41:00.000Z	notplus_M		I just installed Xubuntu 8.10 on my PS3 but I can't seem to get wireless to work... it's not showing my wireless network in the networks list, and when I put in the ESSID and key manually it fails to connect

2008-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	notplus_M	Templar_Xion	when I do ifconfig wlan0 does show up too
2008-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	Templar_Xion	notplus_M	what do you get from typing 'ifconfig' in the terminal?
