2012-07-19T11:59:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	you can try... sudo -u differentuser play /tmp/mysong.mp3
2012-07-19T12:01:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	does not work and doesn't allow X11 to be used.
2012-07-19T12:06:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	sudo -u root play my.mp3 works well. If you need X11 then it is another story ;)
2012-07-19T12:07:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	you are sudoing to root...
2012-07-19T12:07:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	try it as some less privileged user.
2012-07-19T12:10:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	don't have any other user here, sorry. but i see no reason why this should not work.
2012-07-19T12:12:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	yeah, too bad that you not seeing any reason is something the computer doesn't care about.
2012-07-19T12:15:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	what about file permissions? if you sudo -u anotheruser, can that user access the file? :)
2012-07-19T12:15:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	I see that the file is being played. There is just no audible sound.
2012-07-19T12:16:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	and if I login as that user in a completely new session, it does work for that user.
2012-07-19T12:16:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	it is as if there is some logic that only one user can use audio at any time,
2012-07-19T12:18:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	not audio itself, merely the file permissions. check the audio file with ls -la, give it a try
2012-07-19T12:18:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	you are not listening to what I say.
2012-07-19T12:19:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	I said that I can see that the file is being played.
2012-07-19T12:19:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	how the hell do you come with the suggestion that the permissions are wrong?
2012-07-19T12:19:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	If you have nothing intelligent to say, just don't say anything at all.
2012-07-19T12:20:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	because you can open an X11 app that could not read a datastream.
2012-07-19T12:21:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	no
2012-07-19T12:34:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	forget about x11 for a second, try "sudo -u differentuser play /tmp/mysong.mp3". If it does not work please try  "ls -la /tmp/mysong.mp3". If you think this is not helping then I apologize, can't help you.
2012-07-19T12:35:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	play FAIL formats: no handler for file extension `mp3'
2012-07-19T12:36:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	(this is exactly what I mean by suggesting things that you have _tested_)
2012-07-19T12:36:00.000Z	nibblyn	aetoxx	actually I just tested, it works for me :)
2012-07-19T12:37:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	it doesn't work in all environments, which means you have not been complete.
2012-07-19T12:40:00.000Z	aetoxx	nibblyn	here is the error I get then: http://paste.kde.org/519974/
