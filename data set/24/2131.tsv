2009-04-30T23:20:00.000Z	jalen		Hett, how is it a conflict?
2009-04-30T23:21:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I'm connected through wireless network to my wlan, k?
2009-04-30T23:21:00.000Z	jalen	hett	ok.. then you wont need to use your wired one
2009-04-30T23:21:00.000Z	hett	jalen	when I'm turning my wired network on, my inet is screwing up
2009-04-30T23:22:00.000Z	hett	jalen	it's just not working
2009-04-30T23:22:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I'm still having access to my local area network by wireless but not to inet
2009-04-30T23:22:00.000Z	jalen	hett	why would you need your wired connection if you are using your wireless?
2009-04-30T23:24:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I need it, to connect to another computer, but I can't connect that workstation to my wireless
2009-04-30T23:25:00.000Z	jalen	hett	as in you need it isolated from the internet? but still need a connection to your computer?
2009-04-30T23:26:00.000Z	hett	jalen	right! I need my laptop to be connect to my wireless (and inet) and also lan connection to this goddammed workstation
2009-04-30T23:28:00.000Z	jalen	hett	can you just give the isolated workstation a wired connection, then by setting up a static IP, not give it a default route, so it doesnt get internet access?
2009-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I don't need inet on that workstation
2009-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I just need to connect it to my laptop
2009-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	jalen	hett	if you give it a static IP, and no default gateway, it wont have internet, but all of your computers will have access to it
2009-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	jalen	hett	or are you not wanting to go that route?
2009-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	hett	jalen	right, but when on my laptop I'm enabling wired connection, my internet connection through wireless network is sucking
2009-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	jalen	hett	is there a specific reason you want that station isolated from all others, or is it just that you dont want it to have 'net access?
2009-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I just need to connect that station to my laptop, that's all
2009-04-30T23:34:00.000Z	hett	jalen	I'm going to use that via remote desktop
2009-04-30T23:34:00.000Z	jalen	hett	aha, so you want the wired speed so that its more responsive...
2009-04-30T23:35:00.000Z	hett	jalen	k, you can say that :)
2009-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	jalen	hett	try just assigning IPs and netmasks - if there is no gateway assigned, it may work better
2009-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	jalen	hett	and if not, come back and chat again :D
2009-04-30T23:36:00.000Z	hett	jalen	yep, thanks, will try!
