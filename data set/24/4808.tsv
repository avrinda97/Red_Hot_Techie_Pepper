2007-03-01T06:57:00.000Z	xfab		hi there
2007-03-01T06:57:00.000Z	xfab		i've got a little question
2007-03-01T06:58:00.000Z	xfab		I messed up my su-terminal
2007-03-01T06:58:00.000Z	xfab		when I do a su, there's just a # and I can't autocomplete anymore
2007-03-01T06:58:00.000Z	xfab		anybody knows this problem?
2007-03-01T06:59:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	you don't use su - you use sudo
2007-03-01T06:59:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	ok, but I also would like to restore it to default
2007-03-01T07:03:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	would you know how to switch the su-terminal session back to normal, so that I can use the autocomplete feature again?
2007-03-22T08:16:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	what optimisations are you using with the kerenl
2007-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	its not meant to be optimised - its hard to build with optimisations properly

2007-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	read this line Warning: Some of these tips may cause your kernel to not compile properly. Use them at you own risk.
2007-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	if you don't know what your doing, leave them well alone
2007-03-22T08:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	kernel optimisations - unless you know what your doing
2007-03-22T08:19:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	Perhaps I just leave it out, and try another way to my system up safely
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	you're right though
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	your system up safly ?
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	I meant speed up ^^
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	optimisatiosn won't speed up your machine, in some ways it can slow it down
2007-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	that's doesn't make sense at first
2007-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	trust me it does
2007-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	I do :)
2007-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	xfab	ikonia_	there's a programm for that right?
2007-03-22T08:23:00.000Z	ikonia_	xfab	no - you do that
