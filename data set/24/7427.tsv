2004-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	Vigilanty		uhhh
2004-12-21T17:57:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Just explained it to gen. :) What problems are you having?
2004-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	sudo nautilus
2004-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Did it work?
2004-12-21T06:01:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Did Nautilus come up?
2004-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Hold on one second, let me help gen out.
2004-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Once you sudo nautilus, go the folder where your stuff was mounted
2004-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Yeah. Go to the folder where it was mounted.
2004-12-21T06:05:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	What command did you type in to mount the drive?
2004-12-21T06:06:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Is the filesystem for your partition FAT32?
2004-12-21T06:06:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Go to the terminal and type in sudo gedit
2004-12-21T06:07:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Open up this file /etc/fstab.conf
2004-12-21T06:08:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Why?
2004-12-21T06:10:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Add this entry towards the top of your fstab, after proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
2004-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	/dev/hda2       /home/qmaster/windows   vfat    user,rw,umask=000,dmask=000,fmask=000        0        0
2004-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	lol
2004-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Then, edit /dev/hda2 to /dev/hda5
2004-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Go in to your directory (/home/yourusername) and make a folder called windows there.
2004-12-21T06:13:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Then, change the /home/qmaster/windows to /home/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/windows
2004-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Got it all done? Save it and reboot.
2004-12-21T06:24:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Did it work?
2004-12-21T06:24:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	Oh, never mind
2004-12-21T06:26:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Vigilanty	PM me and I'll name you the apps. I use.
