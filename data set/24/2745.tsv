2008-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	yowshi		hello i got a very weird thing going on with my grub involving a grub error 15 anyone think they can help me fix it?
2008-10-29T09:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	we'll all give it a try
2008-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	are you getting this error after a fresh install?
2008-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	umm no this is an old install of 8.04
2008-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	what did you do before this started?
2008-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	worked for months and now getting this strange error
2008-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	i dont think i did anything to cause this.
2008-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	i've not been messing with my grub or anything. rebooted a few times today to OC my comp a little and it worked fine until the last OC atempt when it suddenly wouldnt boot off sda1 anymore
2008-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	is OC--> overclock?
2008-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	yeah
2008-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	does it boot fine when you bring it down to standard freq?
2008-10-29T09:52:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	no i tried brining it back down that didnt fix the issue.
2008-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	do you have the livecd with you? if yes, boot off it and do a grub-install on your boot partition
2008-10-29T09:53:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	i was thinking that actually. i just finished downloading a new livecd since i lost mine also it was an old version of ubuntu anyway
2008-10-29T09:55:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	i'll try that tommorow though. a grub change out is kind of involved and it's 2 am here. to late/early to be doing something that involved
2008-10-29T09:55:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	while i have your atention thugh any online manuals or guides for a grub instal/?
2008-10-29T09:56:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	sure there are a lot of them, let me link you to one of them
2008-10-29T09:56:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	thanks

2008-10-29T20:29:00.000Z	yowshi	outbackwifi	i think i discovered what the grub error 15 means. ummm grub cant find any stage 1 file
2008-10-29T20:29:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	ok
2008-10-30T16:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	8.04 is LTS
2008-10-30T16:27:00.000Z	outbackwifi	yowshi	it wouldnt all be on the same server
