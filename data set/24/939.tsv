2010-12-16T07:15:00.000Z	Matthew_W		could someone tell me how to fix:  "Can't connect to wireless, firmware missing" in maverick?

2010-12-16T07:17:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Not sure, whatever comes standard in a Dell Inspiron 1501
2010-12-16T07:17:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	open a terminal and type "lspci" (thats a lowercase L) hit enter.. and it will spit out your PCI devices, find your wireless device and let me know what ti is(do not paste the whole freaking out put in the channel)
2010-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	give me a few minutes... I have to go find a keyboard to do this
2010-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	unless there's an onscreen keyboard?
2010-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	i dunno, maybe...
2010-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	It's a long story, it's a wall mounted autoupdate photoframe
2010-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	i see.
2010-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Actually it looks like ubuntu smart recognized the drivers were missing in System-Admin-Additional Drivers.
2010-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	ok.. what driver is there for it?
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Though when I did that... it says "system installarchives() failed"
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Broadcom B43
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Though it fails to install
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	yea... i take it it's nt connected to the internet
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Nah, I put a wired conection it
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W		connection*
2010-12-16T07:21:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	so it is
2010-12-16T07:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	ok.. if you can get hardware drivers to load, and activate that b43 driver, it should work
2010-12-16T07:22:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	Though synaptic was running
2010-12-16T07:22:00.000Z	Matthew_W	KM0201	and that's been trouble in the past
2010-12-16T07:22:00.000Z	Matthew_W		trying again
2010-12-16T07:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Matthew_W	well, close synaptic, and open hardware drivers.
