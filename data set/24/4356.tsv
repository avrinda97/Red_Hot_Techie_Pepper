2008-12-16T11:31:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	cheers
2008-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Oi, I have to compile this?
2008-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	no, there's an ubuntu package right there - just click on it
2008-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Ah yes, haha, sorry. Thanks.
2008-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	no worries :)
2008-12-16T11:43:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Hey, sorry, I have a problem finding the package once I add the repositories.. do you know what the problem could be?
2008-12-16T11:44:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	just apt-cache search winff
2008-12-16T11:44:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	and sudo apt-get install?
2008-12-16T11:44:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	yup
2008-12-16T11:45:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Thanks. Is there a way to add it to Main Menu > Sound & Video?
2008-12-16T11:50:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	I think winff doesn't have m4a.. is there another lossless this can convert flacs to that plays on ipods?
2008-12-16T11:51:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Nevermind.. sorry.
2008-12-16T11:55:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	Sorry, I have another question: When I right-click my flac files, the bitrate says N/A... is there a way I cna check this?
2008-12-16T11:55:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	I'm not sure, I haven't used it long enough to know
2008-12-16T11:56:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	I mean just when I right-click > Properties on a flac it doesn't show the bitrate
2008-12-16T11:57:00.000Z	Gnea	mikebot	i really don't know... have you tried opening a terminal and typing:  file file.flac
2008-12-16T11:57:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	No, I'll try that, thanks.
2008-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	mikebot	Gnea	G'night, thanks for all the help.
