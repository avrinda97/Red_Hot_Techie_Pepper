2006-03-20T17:53:00.000Z	Yango		anyone else stumbled upon the pydoc mess upoin the last update?
2006-03-20T17:54:00.000Z	Yango		python programmers aroung?
2006-03-20T17:54:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	a lot of them in #python
2006-03-20T17:55:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	I'm there as well, but my question is not python related, but ubuntu related. Last apt-get update broke my python installation
2006-03-20T17:55:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	in what way?
2006-03-20T17:56:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	now help(command) doesn't work (and yesterday, before the upgrade did)
2006-03-20T17:57:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	in fact pydoc got messed up
2006-03-20T17:57:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	what version did it update to?
2006-03-20T17:58:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	I'm running that and it works.  You are using breezy?
2006-03-20T17:58:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	it works help(list) for instance?
2006-03-20T17:59:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	or running pydoc from the commandline?
2006-03-20T17:59:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	yes to both
2006-03-20T17:59:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	crap, then what can be the problem... have you updated lately? :)
2006-03-20T17:59:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	yep, up to date
2006-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	no idea on the problem, what happens when you try pydoc?
2006-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	http://pastebin.com/602660
2006-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	to any help command, and pydoc from command line.. all the same exception
2006-03-20T06:03:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	hrmm, have you tried reinstalling it?
2006-03-20T06:05:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	nope... any other hint?
2006-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	nope as in reinstall didn't work or nope as in you didn't try yet?
2006-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	nope as in I haven't tried it yet.. I tend to save reinstsalling as a last resource... else I feel like I'm under windows all over again ;)
2006-03-20T06:07:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	well sudo apt-get install --reinstall python python2.4, won't really hurt you any
2006-03-20T06:14:00.000Z	Yango	_jason	reinstall didn't help!!!
2006-03-20T06:15:00.000Z	_jason	Yango	don't know what would cause that... did google turn up anything with the errors?
