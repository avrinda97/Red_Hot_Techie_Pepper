2009-02-18T04:16:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	you log out (or restart your x-server with ctrl-alt-backspace) and then choose "xfce" in you session menu in gdm (if you're using a semi-standard ubuntu setup)
2009-02-18T04:19:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	ctrl-alt-backspace>command not found
2009-02-18T04:19:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	you're supposed to press these keys (in succession), like ctrl-alt-delete ;-)
2009-02-18T04:22:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	why is cmd sudo restart now not found?
2009-02-18T04:29:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	you can choose xfce when you log on ! (in sessions)
2009-02-18T04:30:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	its a remote don't have that option? or do i? i dosen't show
2009-02-18T04:40:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	try "xfdesktop"
2009-02-18T04:40:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	okay same question for you i have it installed now, its on remote how do i start xubuntu-destop?
2009-02-18T04:42:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	how are you connected to the remote server, ssh ? Did you enable x-forwarding, can you start x, etc... You will get better and more precise answers if you provide more information
2009-02-18T04:46:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	(xfdesktop:5497): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
2009-02-18T04:47:00.000Z	Pantung	_dbd_l12	winSCP is the program
2009-02-18T04:49:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	wel that's probably ssh with x forwarding you're doing with winSCP
2009-02-18T04:53:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	try "startxfce4"
2009-02-18T04:54:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	Pantung	do you have x "the gui" running when you are connected to the remote server
