2006-12-07T11:18:00.000Z	uniball		zaan
2006-12-07T11:18:00.000Z	uniball		sorry
2006-12-07T11:18:00.000Z	uniball		didn't notice that
2006-12-07T11:18:00.000Z	uniball		that I did
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	uniball		but after pressing enter for all the other options (leaving them at default), i'm back at the command line now
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	and then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-12-07T11:18:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	I was disconnected... what should I do now, back at the command line?
2006-12-07T11:19:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	starting gnome display manager: FAIL
2006-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	ctrl+alt+f7, and then hit ctrl+alt+backspace, see if that does anything
2006-12-07T11:21:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	brings up a blue screen that says that it failed to start the x server
2006-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	it says: "fatal server error: no screens found"
2006-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	sorry, one sec
2006-12-07T11:24:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	you know pastebin?
2006-12-07T11:25:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	no... what is that?
2006-12-07T11:26:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	actually, never mind, I don't think it helps
2006-12-07T11:26:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	 less /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-12-07T11:27:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	then find Section 'Device'
2006-12-07T11:31:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	I'm going through the xserver-xorg config again
2006-12-07T11:32:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	leave everything else at the defaults, although you can try setting that one to the opposite of what you did last time
2006-12-07T11:33:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	hmm;  there's a live-expert mode you can boot the live cd in, might be a better approach (setting vesa when it asks there;  there might be something weird that makes this not work how I expect after the livecd has booted otherwise)
2006-12-07T11:36:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	I've tried toggling a few settings, but the result is the same: fails to start.
2006-12-07T11:37:00.000Z	cwillu	uniball	try the live-expert boot option on the live cd, and pick vesa from there
2006-12-07T11:38:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	I will
2006-12-07T11:48:00.000Z	uniball	cwillu	it doesn't want to boot "live-expert"
