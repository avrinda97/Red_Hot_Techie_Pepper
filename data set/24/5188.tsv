2008-01-03T18:47:00.000Z	Sergemine		Guys. Looks like my ubuntu system stopped working with fixed IP after system update. Anyone heard of this problem ???
2008-01-03T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 defind 'stopped working' :)
2008-01-03T18:49:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	""Network is unreachable"" iswhat I get when tring to ping computers (when set to use fixed IP)
2008-01-03T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 try pinging them by ip? or by name?
2008-01-03T18:49:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	either
2008-01-03T18:50:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	even my own
2008-01-03T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 try pinging  72.14.207.99  and 'google.com' if Neither work. Sounds like a gateway issue. If the ip works but not the name. its a dns issue.
2008-01-03T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 even your own local lan eh?  Sounding more like a gateway issue.
2008-01-03T18:52:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	I have a dhcp server at home, so it works fine there. But no dhcp in office, have set up a fixed IP, or have system set assign it automatically when dhcp request times out. But network doesn't work at all either way
2008-01-03T18:53:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	there isn't a gateway as far as I know
2008-01-03T18:53:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	they use only a proxy serher here
2008-01-03T18:53:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	any idea ???
2008-01-03T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	Hmm...  well normally theres still a gateway. at an ip like 192.168.1.1 or some smiler low #.  I recall an issue where the /etc/resolv.conf can get wrong dns entries. but Not sure where to trouble shoot yoru system. if its on a business network. it could be somthing odd on their end.
2008-01-03T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 I thinkya need to track down someone with a bit more experience with networking, and your companys network. Id hate to give any suggestions that may mess up the network.(unlikely to happen) but it could somthing simple thats changed on the company network.
2008-01-03T19:00:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	oh, it can barely be called a corporate network
2008-01-03T19:00:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	I have router at home which solves all issues, but they don't here
2008-01-03T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 i imagine they got a machine that does a similer job.  But heck. for all we know it may be crashed and needs to be reset.
2008-01-03T19:01:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	Thank you very much any way. I tend to think it is an ubuntu problem simmilar to that with xserver update so time before
2008-01-03T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 now to TEST that theory - you could try out some of the various live cd's :) done that befor.
2008-01-03T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 of course just last night here.. the wifes laptop networks stopped working.. turned out it was her network cable that was bad. she had pinched it for so long at a bad angle it broke.
2008-01-03T19:05:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	I am afraid that is what I will do eventially. Do not want to go that way as my graphics card is not supported out of the box and once installed the system it is difficult for me to load of the live cd in office as I have to attache another screen for that
2008-01-03T19:06:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	but now I used the easier options and probably need to do that as I DO LIKE UBUNTU AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IN OFFICE
2008-01-03T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sergemine	 Hmm. what video card? You could just test the network with a console on a live cd.    DSL or PuppyLinux is just a 50 or so mb download to test out.  I just take the 'lets elminate everything that it can be' befor digging into ubuntus networking. Heck- It could be a typo in the network settings for all we know.
2008-01-03T19:08:00.000Z	Sergemine	Dr_willis	plus It installed a network printer some time before which the latest version of windows + laters drivers wasn't able to install no metter how much I tried
