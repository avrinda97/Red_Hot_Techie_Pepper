2010-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Hibernate instead.
2010-05-01T08:22:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	i dont want to hibernate
2010-05-01T08:22:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	i want something like standby as we have in windows
2010-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	 help
2010-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	help?
2010-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	is this your first Ubuntu install on that computer?
2010-05-01T08:30:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	If not, has standby had different results in the past?
2010-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	 yes
2010-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	this is only install of ubuntu under windows
2010-05-01T08:35:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Alright, had to check. It may be that some devices on your computer don't directly support standby mode under linux.
2010-05-01T08:36:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	It's been quite some time since I've owned a laptop, so I'm not entirely sure how much help I can be here.
2010-05-01T08:36:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	ok
2010-05-01T08:37:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	The best solution I can give is to use hibernate instead until Google-fu provides you with something better, but that doesn't exactly work well if you're looking to have the laptop go to standby when you shut the lid (or similar situations).
2010-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	what is Google -fu
2010-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Google-fu is the art of using Google to hunt down a solution.
2010-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	can u explain me?
2010-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	so i can check myself
2010-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Start by searching for 'ubuntu standby problem', refine your search if need be with your laptop's manufacturer and/or model number.
2010-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Most importantly, be prepared to read. A lot.
2010-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	yeah but how use Google -fu
2010-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Google-fu isn't a site, it's a term for general knowledge of Google or other search engines applied to find a result.
2010-05-01T08:50:00.000Z	ravenkhan	taroven	ok means that just check the thing in google.com .  I thought this might be a channel
2010-05-01T08:50:00.000Z	taroven	ravenkhan	Correct, I wasn't implying that you go anywhere you wouldn't normally.
