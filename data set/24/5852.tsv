2006-09-29T14:24:00.000Z	Emask		hi
2006-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	Emask		does anyone know of any reason why ubuntu might not be able to setup the network via dhcp?
2006-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	Emask		no ethernet
2006-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	Emask		10Mbps
2006-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	ccureau	Emask	old ISA card?
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		nope
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		this system worked perfectly
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		puppy linux connects and works fine
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		thats how im talking to u
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		dhcpclient just tells me it can't find a lease
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		no offer
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	ccureau	Emask	maybe ubu doesn't set up ethernet card correctly?
2006-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	Emask		why would it suddenly not set it up right?
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Emask		eth0 is shown in ifconfig
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Emask		and /proc/net/dev
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Emask		puppy linux finds a lease fine
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	ccureau	Emask	can you set IP address directly?
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Emask	ubuntu	was seemingly fine until a few days ago
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	ccureau		that would be my next step
2006-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	Emask		not really.............. i am at uni......... and the network is huge so i don't know what ips are available
2006-09-29T14:28:00.000Z	Emask		eth0 is my network card
2006-09-29T14:28:00.000Z	Emask		as i said, this is an issue that has just cropped up out of nowhere
2006-09-29T14:28:00.000Z	Emask		it was fine until a few days ago
2006-09-29T14:28:00.000Z	ccureau	Emask	take the IP assigned to you now in puppy and assign it in ubu to test
