2009-05-26T08:47:00.000Z	onexused		How do I install drivers for my wireless card?  I went to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and clicked "Activate" for the driver, and it told me it was downloading and installing the driver, but the bar never got past 0% and the card still doesn't show up in "ifconfig -a".
2009-05-26T08:48:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	have you downloaded all updates first?
2009-05-26T08:49:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	I just installed Ubuntu, haven't done anything else.  Am I going to have to do an update to get the wireless drivers?  I was hoping to use the wireless card somewhere to do the update because of connection speed.
2009-05-26T08:50:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	i have seen a few cases where you needed to get updates first..
2009-05-26T08:51:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	That's too bad.  I guess I can always let it run overnight for a couple days...
2009-05-26T08:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	dial-up?
2009-05-26T08:51:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	Unfortunately.
2009-05-26T08:52:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	cant run a cat5 cable?
2009-05-26T08:53:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	I can, but where do I hook the other end?  A place with free wireless Internet is where I was going to use the wireless card.
2009-05-26T08:54:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	possible to take to a friend's just to get the updates?
2009-05-26T08:55:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	I suppose I can.
2009-05-26T08:55:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	Mostly, I installed Ubuntu to see if the wireless card would work with little trouble, so I could keep Ubuntu if so : )  If I have to update first, I'll try that.
2009-05-26T08:56:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	i know, its a pain, but i was lucky i could here, but that was with 8.10, what did you install?
2009-05-26T08:56:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	8.10 'cause that's the CD I had.
2009-05-26T08:56:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	and what wireless card you have?
2009-05-26T08:57:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	BCM4328
2009-05-26T08:57:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	try 9.04 if you can get it
2009-05-26T08:58:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	It doesn't have that problem?  I should, if that's the case.
2009-05-26T08:58:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	8.10 was terrible IMO, especially with the initial wireless,,,
2009-05-26T08:59:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	Okay.
2009-05-26T09:00:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	and mine did same with BCM43XX
2009-05-26T09:01:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	Okay.  Thanks for helping.
2009-05-26T09:01:00.000Z	SeaPhor	onexused	if i'm not here you  can find me on #seaphor
2009-05-26T09:02:00.000Z	onexused	SeaPhor	Okay.
