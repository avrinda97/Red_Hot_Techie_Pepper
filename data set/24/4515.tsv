2007-04-01T14:45:00.000Z	shinichizio		Can I ask a question about Nautilus? or should I go somewhere else?
2007-04-01T14:46:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	ask
2007-04-01T14:47:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	For some odd reason, whenever I try to open any folders (Ie. anything on my desktop, home folder, etc.) Nautilus closes unexpectedly. Upon trying to report the bug, bug-buddy closes unexpectedly. : (
2007-04-01T14:47:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	run "nautilus" in the terminal and see what happens
2007-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	is there any output?
2007-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	None at all
2007-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	well that is kind of hard to troubleshoot
2007-04-01T14:48:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	Yeah, I know!
2007-04-01T14:49:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	you can install thunar or something for the time being if you need a graphical file manager
2007-04-01T14:49:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	yeah, you can use the terminal
2007-04-01T14:50:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	move files with mv, copy files with cp, remove files with rm and so forth and so on
2007-04-01T15:19:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	thunar is very small
2007-04-01T15:19:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	I wouldn't uninstall nautilus
2007-04-01T15:19:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	Less than 10meg?
2007-04-01T15:20:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	3meg
2007-04-01T15:20:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	it has dependencies
2007-04-01T15:20:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	the actualy thunar download is just 384 kb
2007-04-01T15:21:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	It has whats?
2007-04-01T15:21:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	dependencies, packages that it needs to run, it is probably installing those
2007-04-01T15:22:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	Um. I might be dumber than I look. I'm downloading the 'graphical installer' because I figured there was less chance of me fouling up with a GUI around things. Obviously that was a bad idea.
2007-04-01T15:22:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	yeah delete that stuff
2007-04-01T15:22:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	ubuntu has its own software repositories accessed through apt-get, so just do "sudo apt-get install thunar"
2007-04-01T15:23:00.000Z	shinichizio	bruenig	I keep forgetting that I can do that.
2007-04-02T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	shinichizio	top
