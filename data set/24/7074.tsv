2005-04-30T08:32:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	what package failed to install?
2005-04-30T08:33:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	now do: sudo apt-get -f install
2005-04-30T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	what does apt-cache policy nvidia-glx tell you?
2005-04-30T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	you don't need to do any compiling for nvidia drivers
2005-04-30T08:37:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	that's not good.  You should use the ubuntu packages
2005-04-30T08:39:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	that's the method to follow
2005-04-30T08:41:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	you should uninstall the official nvidia stuff before installing the ubuntu packages
2005-04-30T08:42:00.000Z	Wings	tritium	where do I do that?
2005-04-30T08:43:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	do what?
2005-04-30T08:43:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	I never installed them.  You tell me.  I only use the ubuntu packages/
2005-04-30T08:44:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	you said you installed them
2005-04-30T08:47:00.000Z	Wings	tritium	do you know a place where I can upload the text in the terminal that I get when I use the command from the  site?
2005-04-30T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	is it short?  Are you using xchat?
2005-04-30T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	you can use "/exec -o <command>" if it won't paste too many lines
2005-04-30T08:49:00.000Z	Wings	tritium	here it is http://www.pastebin.com/273228
2005-04-30T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	please uninstall the nvidia stuff you installed from the .run file before we do any troubleshooting
2005-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	looks like you've installed ati drivers too (fglrx).  Why?
2005-04-30T08:50:00.000Z	Wings	tritium	how can I get rid of them?
2005-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	apt-get remove --purge them is what I'd do
2005-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	Wings	tritium	it's not working, but I'll just reinstall it
2005-04-30T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	which isn't working?
2005-04-30T08:52:00.000Z	tritium	Wings	you have to install it after you remove fglrx
