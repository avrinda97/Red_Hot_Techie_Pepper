2010-03-26T00:47:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2		My Ubuntu 9.10 install fails to boot with any kernel, throwing a "gave up for root device" and falling to a shell. Tried messing around with rootdelay and using absolute paths to root instead of uuid but nothing seems to work. Any ideas? It was booting up normally before today.
2010-03-26T00:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	using grub2?
2010-03-26T00:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	have more that on hdd?
2010-03-26T00:49:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	more than one
2010-03-26T00:52:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	did it ever worked before?
2010-03-26T00:52:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	not even once?
2010-03-26T00:52:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	yes, it was working perfectly before today
2010-03-26T00:52:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	and you booted windows the last time?
2010-03-26T00:53:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	can you still remember?
2010-03-26T00:53:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	No, last time I was working on Ubuntu. I mostly left the WinXP partition there because it was required by my uni's techs
2010-03-26T00:54:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	ok, insert a livecd and boot into it and recover grub and place it back into the MBR
2010-03-26T00:54:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	but I tried booting into windows when I saw it wasn't working and it booted ok
2010-03-26T00:54:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	grub-install?
2010-03-26T00:55:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	the reason for me to ask you is that HP laptops have a tendency of crashing grub2
2010-03-26T00:56:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	I forgot the syntax, it's been sometime, its 'sudo grub-install --recheck --root-directory=mount_point_of_ubuntu /dev/sda'
2010-03-26T00:56:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	yes, it's an HP laptop... let me try with the LiveCD, then
2010-03-26T00:56:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	that works on grub legacy
2010-03-26T00:57:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	am not sure about the grub2 recovery syntax but try ubuntugeek
2010-03-26T00:57:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	I'll get on the man pages and be back once I do that
2010-03-26T00:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	if it is HP you will see it yourself, it will work fine until you boot windows. next time your grub wont boot ubuntu again
2010-03-26T00:58:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	to inform if it works or not
2010-03-26T00:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	good luck
2010-03-26T00:58:00.000Z	Zeratul2k2	mkanyicy	thanks
2010-03-26T01:17:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Zeratul2k2	is it fine now?
