2008-09-23T05:52:00.000Z	HollywoodJumper		i would rather find linux software that does the same stuff than have to pay money to windows for stuff that should be free
2008-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	HollywoodJumper		i hate to say it but i am unable to find software in linux flavor for my ipod itouch that i wish i hadnt bought
2008-09-23T05:55:00.000Z	HollywoodJumper		all of the comments that i have read said that the only way to make itouch work is by doing a jailbreak
2008-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	yeah, jailbreak it and it should work
2008-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	I've jailbroken mine.  It's so much better.  It's like a little unix machine in the palm of your hand.  And there isn't that much risk involved if you use pwnage.  If something goes wrong, you just restore it using itunes
2008-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	http://blog.iphone-dev.org/  I used pwnage instead of quickpwn a few days ago
2008-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	yep, I did it from os x
2008-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	wait though.  Do you have one of the new 2g itouches?

2008-09-27T21:45:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	do you have a problem with wiping your current ubuntu install?
2008-09-27T21:45:00.000Z	HollywoodJumper	jrib	how do i do that?
2008-09-27T21:46:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	I've never installed vista.  ##windows might be able to tell you if the installer can wipe the drive and create a partition for windows while leaving unpartitioned space for ubuntu.  Your other option is to use gparted on a live cd
2008-09-27T21:48:00.000Z	HollywoodJumper	jrib	i tried to reformat but wouldnt work
2008-09-27T21:48:00.000Z	jrib	HollywoodJumper	##windows will be more knowledgeable about the vista installer
