2007-09-23T11:36:00.000Z	d		Hey, I need some help. I was just messing around with gdmconfig and broke my gdm. I don't have a backup of /etc/gdm or /usr/share/gdm. I tried doing a remove and install, bt it's still broke
2007-09-23T11:36:00.000Z	d		I'm on irc through bitchx right now :(
2007-09-23T11:37:00.000Z	d		is there any way for me to recover the default gdm files besides a fresh install?
2007-09-23T11:38:00.000Z	d		ideas? :(
2007-09-23T11:38:00.000Z	d		I'd even take someone tarballing theirs and sending to me
2007-09-23T11:39:00.000Z	overclucker	d	gdm config settings are kept in $HOME
2007-09-23T11:39:00.000Z	d	overclucker	will check there
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	d	overclucker	which folder?
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	d		I have no ~/.gdm
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	overclucker	d	remember to press ctrl-h to show hidden files
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	d	overclucker	I have no X
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	d		my gdm config is busted
2007-09-23T11:40:00.000Z	d		need the actual folder
2007-09-23T11:41:00.000Z	d	overclucker	fill in the blank -- ~/.????/gdm
2007-09-23T11:41:00.000Z	overclucker	d	it is your home folder, if u are logged in the type cd $HOME
2007-09-23T11:41:00.000Z	overclucker	d	what is your username?
2007-09-23T11:42:00.000Z	d	overclucker	d
2007-09-23T11:42:00.000Z	d	overclucker	/home/d/.gdm does not exist
2007-09-23T11:42:00.000Z	overclucker		.gconf
2007-09-23T11:43:00.000Z	d	overclucker	still don't see it
2007-09-23T11:43:00.000Z	overclucker	d	.gconf, .gnome2, .gconfd
2007-09-23T11:44:00.000Z	overclucker	d	try cd .[tab] [tab] 
2007-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	d		looks like livecd is going to be the only way. gdm is definitly not stored in ~/ I did some grepping in /etc/gdm and see the Xgl line causing me all this trouble is in there
2007-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	overclucker	d	i g2g, goodluck!
