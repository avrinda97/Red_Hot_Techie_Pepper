2011-11-06T22:06:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		so...I was in the middle of recording some music tracks, and my whole /home switched to read-only, and I cannot switch it back
2011-11-06T22:06:00.000Z	theMAVERICK		has anyone heard of this problem?
2011-11-06T22:08:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	sounds like system found error on /home partition and remounted read only, reboot from cd and fsck your drive
2011-11-06T22:08:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	crap, this is the second time this has happened after wiping the disks
2011-11-06T22:08:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	so, they are pretty much fried, huh?
2011-11-06T22:10:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	I have a usb drive here that does the same thing from time to time, but it happens when drive is reading and usb polls another device, causing drive to pause. could be hardware, could be something to do with running processes
2011-11-06T22:10:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	so, can I atleast recover my data that I currently have before the reboot
2011-11-06T22:11:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	because a reboot will not even give me a shell, and a livecd will not allow me to tweak the partitions, I have tried numerous times
2011-11-06T22:11:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	you should be able to, like i said boot from live cd, ie: knoppix and fsck the /home partition
2011-11-06T22:11:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	I promise it won't work, I tried for the last two weeks
2011-11-06T22:11:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	whatever you do, don't fsck mounted partition
2011-11-06T22:12:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	bad things happen if you do
2011-11-06T22:12:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	agreed, so...then it is impossible to get this data off, or what?
2011-11-06T22:12:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	this is a re-recording of a track I lost last week because of the same problem
2011-11-06T22:12:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	I REALLY don't want to redo it a third time
2011-11-06T22:13:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	after fsck the partition from knoppix, reboot and see if it mounts correctly, if so i don't see why you couldn't recover it
2011-11-06T22:13:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	here is the problem, knoppix and livecds crash when I try to use fdisk or gdisk after this GPT error
2011-11-06T22:14:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	I tried a couple different versions, basically as soon as I shutdown, this is done, I lose it all
2011-11-06T22:14:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	don't use fdisk, use fsck
2011-11-06T22:14:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	that is what I meant
2011-11-06T22:15:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	before I tinker, it is impossible to get the data off of the computer?
2011-11-06T22:16:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	because last time I rebooted with a livecd, fsck, fdisk, gparted everything i tried would not deal with this mystery GPT partition that appears out of nowhere
2011-11-06T22:16:00.000Z	twitchnln	theMAVERICK	doubtful, but then i'm not at console so i can't say for sure, more than likely the data will be recoverable
2011-11-06T22:17:00.000Z	theMAVERICK	twitchnln	definitely not
