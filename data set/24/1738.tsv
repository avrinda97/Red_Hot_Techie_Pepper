2009-09-17T09:20:00.000Z	shutter1234		i dual boot ubuntu/winxp. past few days ive noticed some strange file space issues...i opened up disk usage analyzer...says total filesystem usage 29.4g....this is ONLY including the ubuntu partition correct?
2009-09-17T09:21:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	no, that must include your home files too, no way can that be just the filesystem
2009-09-17T09:21:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	home files?
2009-09-17T09:21:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	your user files
2009-09-17T09:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	did you install /home on a separate partition? or just install everything to one partition
2009-09-17T09:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	you probably installed everything to one partition especially if it is 29GB worth of files
2009-09-17T09:22:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	yeah, it's all one partition, one for ubuntu one for win
2009-09-17T09:23:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	in that case all your files and system files are included in that 29gb stuff
2009-09-17T09:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	have you emptied the trash?
2009-09-17T09:24:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	yeah
2009-09-17T09:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	I find it hard to believe that the HD is corrupted, but I guess it isn't impossible
2009-09-17T09:25:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	ahh, brasero, say no more
2009-09-17T09:25:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	you have a brasero problem, not a hd corruption problem
2009-09-17T09:26:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	use k3b it will pull in some kde dependencies, but it is worth it
2009-09-17T09:26:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	sudo apt-get install k3b
2009-09-17T09:26:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	that's my plan, but i'm still trying to figure out why it's saying i have less space after i cleared more space
2009-09-17T09:27:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	because brasero probably has some tmp files somewhere eating space, reboot should clear that.
2009-09-17T09:27:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	already rebooted
2009-09-17T09:28:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	I have run into this before, but don't remember what happened, you are going to have to find the braser junk and delete it
2009-09-17T09:28:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	losher can help you
2009-09-17T09:31:00.000Z	shutter1234	shane2peru	but thanks for clarifying that my initial concerns were probably on mark and making me feel like i i took the appropriate steps
2009-09-17T09:31:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	no prob
2009-09-17T09:39:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	it will be in a file called du,out
2009-09-17T09:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	shutter1234	ahh, there was an issue with trash not being emptied too, that is probably it
