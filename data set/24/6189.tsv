2006-05-03T09:53:00.000Z	harisund		oh tomcat.. I am sorry I don't know the procedure for that :(
2006-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	harisund		Whose the guy(s) who's in charge of deciding what goes into the ubuntu-desktop meta package?
2006-05-03T09:54:00.000Z	harisund		I see. Not that there is anything I can do about it, but there's a lot of stuff in ubuntu-desktop that average users don't need.
2006-05-03T09:55:00.000Z	harisund		bicycle-repair? Malayalam fonts? bluez-utils?
2006-05-03T09:56:00.000Z	harisund		And it's an unnecessary startup program. The first thing I do is "update-rc.d -f bluez-utils remove"
2006-05-03T09:57:00.000Z	harisund		Does either of Breezy or Dapper LiveCD have the ability to boot into command line mode only?
2006-05-03T09:57:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	I believe you can switch into command line with ctl alt f2
2006-05-03T09:57:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	if you are using gdm (gnome)
2006-05-03T09:58:00.000Z	harisund		alejandro: that's true, but that defeats the purpose. I am talking about some quick repair that I need to do, and I use the LiveCD and want to quikly log into command line only.
2006-05-03T09:58:00.000Z	harisund		Are there any electrical engineers in here? I am looking for a nice Spice program on linux. :)
2006-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	livecd goes straight into gnome
2006-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	I think there is a recovery mode though
2006-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	harisund		alejandro: yeah, I want to avoid that. Is that possible?
2006-05-03T10:00:00.000Z	harisund	gerzel	They are called factoids. You can ask the IRC bot here (ubotu)
2006-05-03T10:01:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	I can't remember the boot options for the livecd off the top of my head
2006-05-03T10:01:00.000Z	harisund	gerzel	You can send ubotu a private message using the command "/msg ubotu <factoid>" and it will tell you what it knows on the topic.
2006-05-03T10:01:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	there might be a command line one
2006-05-03T10:01:00.000Z	harisund		alejandro: Never mind thanks a lot though .. I am guessing there must ..
2006-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	{alejandro}		harisund
2006-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	{alejandro}		use failsafe
2006-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	harisund		Sinta[x]  Preferrably Windows first.
2006-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	harisund		alejandro: Oh thanks.. didn't realize that was command line mode.. :) sounded suspicious ..
2006-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	you can also do that from an install of ubuntu
2006-05-03T10:03:00.000Z	{alejandro}	harisund	from grub when you pick the failsafe version of a kernel, it is console mode
