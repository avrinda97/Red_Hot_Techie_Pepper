2010-07-26T22:54:00.000Z	besogon		hello
2010-07-26T22:54:00.000Z	besogon		What is STUN server?
2010-07-26T22:54:00.000Z	besogon		And where can I find that?
2010-07-26T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 clarify what you are talking about.
2010-07-26T22:57:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	I have a home router on which NAT is turned on. DDC don't work
2010-07-26T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 there proberly a router config, or irc client config you can do to tweak that.. but ive not used that D cc  type feature of irc in years.
2010-09-11T11:50:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	Its better works with xorg.conf
2010-09-11T11:50:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	more stable
2010-09-11T11:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 state the issue and see what happens
2010-09-11T11:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 you mean ping by name? or ping by ip# ?
2010-09-11T11:56:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	yes
2010-09-11T11:57:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	But I can see workgroups and master browsers NetBIOS names al the same
2010-09-11T11:57:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	I can ping by IP
2010-09-11T11:58:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	but not NetBIOS
2010-09-11T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 Im not sure that wins does let you ping by hostname.. ive never seen it work that. i always edit my /etc/hosts to have the proper name/ip so i can ping via hostname
2010-09-11T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 been wanting to ask about that in #samba someday.. but never gotten around to it
2010-09-11T12:02:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	I heard that samba WINs and Windows WINs are not compatible. It can be the reason but I don't sure
2010-09-11T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 my issue is i have one 'nas' that works if i access it via ip. OR its name.. but its not showing up on any machine  when they show machines on the network. :)
2010-09-11T12:29:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	see about samba ports in Backgraund Info of the page http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/integrate-ms-networks.html
2010-09-11T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 been readuing up on all teh docs.. im not sure if its an acutal samba config issue.. or some other odd networking config issue on this thing.
2010-10-24T11:56:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	oh. don't lie to him. Unr is not for netbooks now
2011-01-23T16:30:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	NFS is not convenient way I suppose even thou it is the fastest one
2011-01-23T16:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	besogon	 depends on what your convience is.. :)
2011-01-23T16:31:00.000Z	besogon	Dr_Willis	For me it's using Nautilus and Win clients if possible
