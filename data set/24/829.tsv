2011-01-02T09:31:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		Hey all
2011-01-02T09:31:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		I need some help with this install...
2011-01-02T09:31:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		I am running ubuntu off my USB flash drive, and I wish to install it alongside of Windows...
2011-01-02T09:31:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		However, it's not recognizing the other OS.
2011-01-02T09:32:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno		There's no option for "Install alongside other operating systems"
2011-01-02T09:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l"?
2011-01-02T09:36:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- http://pastebin.com/L9vsXNDc
2011-01-02T09:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Is there any output from "sudo os-prober"?
2011-01-02T09:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Well, your hard drive already has 4 primary partitions, which would make it difficult to add another for Ubuntu.
2011-01-02T09:43:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- what I don't understand is how all those partitions got there in the first place.
2011-01-02T09:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Some OEMs make idiotic decisions.
2011-01-02T09:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	If you don't ever use recovery partitions then you can remove that.
2011-01-02T09:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Size doesn't matter, it's the need for a primary partition.
2011-01-02T09:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	And if you replace the recovery partition with an extended one you can create as many additional partitions as you want, which is one of the reasons why it's particularly stupid for an OEM to ship 4 primary partitions (none of which are extended).
2011-01-02T09:52:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- if it says "boot, diag" for certain Flags, does that mean that's the bootstrap of my OS?
2011-01-02T09:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Diagnostics, i.e. a bootable partition with diagnostic utilities.
2011-01-02T09:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Yes.
2011-01-02T10:05:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- can you give me that link I posted earlier? the pastebin?
2011-01-02T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	http://pastebin.com/L9vsXNDc
2011-01-02T10:06:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- thanks
2011-01-02T10:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	You're welcome.
2011-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- Partition 4 is the backup drive.
2011-01-02T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Da_Rhyno	Even if the windows terminalogy is "Drive letters" partitions are never "drives".
2011-01-02T10:14:00.000Z	Da_Rhyno	Jordan_U	- my bad.
