2009-11-22T00:23:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	It's not that simple. What soundcard do you have?

2009-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	onboard
2009-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	Have you check the Sound Preference if any of the output is muted, and check alsamixer if any of the output is muted?
2009-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	yes
2009-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	even no sound at startup
2009-11-22T00:25:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	What laptop brand and model are you using?
2009-11-22T00:25:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	it's desktop pc
2009-11-22T00:25:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	945GCT-M2 Mainboard
2009-11-22T00:28:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	What your output of lspci | grep audio

2009-11-22T00:37:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	lspci | grep audio
2009-11-22T00:37:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	nothing!
2009-11-22T00:38:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	it just go the next line
2009-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	Then it probably means your soundcard is not recognised in Ubuntu. Hmm, If you go to Hardware Drivers, are there any drivers for your device?
2009-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	no
2009-11-22T00:40:00.000Z	khensthoth	Parsi	Search around in the forum or in Google then, sorry couldn't be of much help.
2009-11-22T00:41:00.000Z	Parsi	khensthoth	ok.
