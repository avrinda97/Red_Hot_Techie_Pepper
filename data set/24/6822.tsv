2006-02-28T15:20:00.000Z	ufo		why cant amule connect to servers?
2006-02-28T15:20:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	are you using firestarter or similar?
2006-02-28T15:21:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	are you behind a router? is the router forwarding the right ports to your amule box?
2006-02-28T15:22:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	yes i am and everything else is working
2006-02-28T15:23:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	your router probably has a firewall in it. you will need to open the port and forward it to your amule box.
2006-02-28T15:24:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	yes it does forward everything
2006-02-28T15:27:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	if the router is passing the infomation (correct prt forwarding)  and the PC is receiving the inforamtion (no firewall) then the only other problem would be if your ISP is blocking the port.
2006-02-28T15:28:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	it works on windows
2006-02-28T15:28:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	it works on my ubuntu box. does your windows system reside on the same pc?
2006-02-28T15:30:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	do you use dapper?
2006-02-28T15:30:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	nope.
2006-02-28T15:31:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	i do
2006-02-28T15:31:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	does your windows OS reside on the same machine as your Dapper OS?
2006-02-28T15:31:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	yes
2006-02-28T15:33:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	ok, :) so we know the info is getting as far as the pc. Try installing firestarter and opening the right ports.
2006-02-28T15:35:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	not that I know, but I am running out of ideas! :)
2006-02-28T15:35:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	ListenSocket: Could not listen to TCP port.
2006-02-28T15:41:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	the xmule works out of the box but amule not
2006-02-28T15:42:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	you have logged in haven't you?

2006-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	selinium	ufo	one mo, just installing it here.
2006-02-28T16:09:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	ok.. now it works had to install xmule and after that amule then it works??
2006-02-28T16:09:00.000Z	ufo	selinium	then remove xmule
