2006-05-27T07:28:00.000Z	lastnode		when i try to apt-get remove totem, it tries to remove ubuntu-desktop as well. what goes?
2006-05-27T07:29:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	it's a virtual dependancy
2006-05-27T07:29:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	how can i remove it? totem sucks, i want to remove everything related with it so my media doesnt automatically try to open in it.i use xine.
2006-05-27T07:30:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	- check out the "unoffical ubuntu guide"

2006-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	- it has to do with modifying your /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
2006-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	thanks
2006-05-27T07:33:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	- some more info here http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu
2006-05-27T07:34:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	thanks mate, im just using this ubuntu install until i get my gentoo partition setup anyway
2006-05-27T07:35:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	- nice, i used to be a gentoo guy myself, but i don't have time to tinker much anymore, and ubuntu works well out of the box...... btw, is dapper out of beta yet?
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	im not sure, im installing from a flight5 cd. ill have to dist-upgrade soon. i usually run debian etch / gentoo dual boot, but lawrence lessig is in town today, and i want to go hear him speak. i b0rked my disk so i had to dd it last night.
2006-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	at least yo ugot it runnign again. hope you didn't lose anything.....
2006-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	i had my writing backed up to my gmail :)
2006-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	good work. always good to have a backup plan :). i built a RAID5 box and use Unison for just such a case.
2006-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	ive heard good things about unison. :) im debating whether to debootstrap etch now or wait till i get to the conference
2006-05-27T07:40:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	i might just keep this ubuntu install if i can kill the boot time a little. remove some inits
2006-05-27T07:41:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	good call. :)
2006-05-27T07:41:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	this is a notebook

2006-05-27T07:47:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	i think it uses the device list, but i'm not sure
2006-05-27T07:53:00.000Z	d33t	lastnode	why not switch to what you really want..... *box
2006-05-27T07:53:00.000Z	lastnode	d33t	gnome comes the battery applets etc
