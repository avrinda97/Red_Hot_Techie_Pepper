2006-01-01T17:37:00.000Z	Shadyman		!restrictedformats
2006-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	Shadyman		What's the apt-get for the tools such as make, and C++ libs, etc?
2006-01-01T17:41:00.000Z	Shadyman		Is it just me, or does KDE just crash because it likes to?
2006-01-01T17:41:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	it's just you
2006-01-01T17:41:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	Darn.
2006-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	kde never crashed for me
2006-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	Every redhat or fedora install i've done with kde always crashes for the darndest things.
2006-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	It's like, oh noes! You pressed the back button! *crash*
2006-01-01T17:43:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	I experience no such thing
2006-01-01T17:43:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	I managed to lock up X, messing with glx but I'm sure it would have happened in any wm
2006-01-01T17:43:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	True.
2006-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	but i've never been able to crash Gnome, even with all the incessant Back-button pushing I do.
2006-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	yeah. you should use gnome then :)
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	I guess, because I love pressing the Back button.
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	personally I agree with the path that gnome has taken though
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	How so?
2006-01-01T17:45:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	with Linus that is
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	I meant I agree with Linus views on the path that gnome has taken
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	Oh.
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	That explains it a bit better :D
2006-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	mwe	Shadyman	yeah :)
2006-01-06T07:54:00.000Z	Shadyman	mwe	Yes.
