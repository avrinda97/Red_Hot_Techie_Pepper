2006-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	note the "old-releases" in the URL. those releases are retired, and the tracker no longer is tracking them
2006-12-04T17:51:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
2006-12-04T17:53:00.000Z	hkais	mnepton	if you take care of http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/, here it is posted, that "this" old releases are available, therefore I would excpect:
2006-12-04T17:54:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	just don;t use the .torrent
2006-12-04T17:54:00.000Z	hkais	mnepton	there are only the torrent links
2006-12-04T17:55:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	for what release?
2006-12-04T17:55:00.000Z	hkais	mnepton	^

2006-12-04T17:56:00.000Z	hkais	mnepton	yes
2006-12-04T17:56:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	unsupported, retired release.
2006-12-04T17:56:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	anything relating to Hoary will be pulled off the websites soon.
2006-12-04T17:57:00.000Z	hkais	mnepton	yes but it should be mentioned on the site, that the files aren't available any more?
2006-12-04T17:57:00.000Z	mnepton	hkais	the files *are* available. they just don;t work. ;)
