2007-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	are u using the ubuntu 7.04 live cd or the alternate cd ?
2007-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	where did you download it from ?
2007-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	okay you got the cd from shipit. Waht version is it ?
2007-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	you need to put the cd in the drive and then boot the computer from the cd
2007-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	you need to check if it the richt version: 64 bits, 32 bits, mac, it on the cd-sleeve.
2007-05-16T05:38:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	no mention of 64 bits  then
2007-05-16T05:38:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	could be. if it boots it goes straight into the # prompt ?
2007-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	I have no clue. Could be a wrong cd, indeed.

2007-05-16T05:41:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	you can boot it from wind*ws
2007-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	you could try Knoppix or Mepis, see if they boot, you need to DL them and burn them. Maybe you have some special hardware ?
2007-05-16T05:44:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	did you check the URL I send ?
2007-05-16T05:48:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	yes, so that maybe why you don't get much help... google around, see if some has a solution.... NOAPIC might help, in the boot options during boot... but who know... 1
2007-05-16T05:49:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	Normally, youl have a fully working ubuntu gnu/linux system when you boot off the cd. However, on some motherboards it dont work... I had a VIA chipset that I couldnt get to work...
2007-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	mine doesn work either.... I am waiting download of another....
2007-05-16T06:12:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	meanwhile helping out a bit...
2007-05-16T06:13:00.000Z	ace_ace	JoeMorris	optimist! maybe try dapper, it has long term support.
