2007-11-07T04:47:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Lishious	Ok, please go to the mandriva channel and tell them they should help you add an entry in grub, tell them that you found (hd0,4) and (hd0,6) being the locations of your distros. And, is it the latest ubuntu gutsy?
2007-11-07T04:47:00.000Z	Lishious	Shapeshifter	Cant you find out the root by going to /boot/( then the image u boot) its ubunto 7.10
2007-11-07T04:50:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Lishious	I don't know where mandriva has it's grub menu.lst. You need to find that one, then paste this at the end of the list: http://pastebin.org/7276 read the comment at the beginning, and don't paste it ^^
2007-11-07T04:51:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Lishious	hda means IDE drive, sda means SATA drive btw (or modern IDE controller) you should know which one you will need to use.
