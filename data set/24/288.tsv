2012-01-25T14:03:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	yes i am connected to freenode by that
2012-01-25T14:04:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	even my network manager says no internet connection
2012-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	did you install anything or change something before this started?
2012-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	no, it has been like this forever
2012-01-25T14:06:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	weird... for starters try a complete update. in console: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2012-01-25T14:07:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	everything is updated
2012-01-25T14:07:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	i can use synaptics to install packages
2012-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	let me guess 11.10?
2012-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	yes

2012-01-25T14:15:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	 what do i put in dns and gateway it changes all the time i connect to isp
2012-01-25T14:15:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	sorry for being noob
2012-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	open a terminal, ifconfig -a , take a look at your connected device, and all the details should be there.
2012-01-25T14:18:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	you can deliberately run the network manager applet with nm-applet. ensure there's nothing else conflicting, wicd or whatever.
2012-01-25T14:20:00.000Z	metaspike	ripthejacker	what are you using to connect?!
2012-01-25T14:45:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	thanks its working now
2012-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	one small doubt rite now i have put in valid values as address and gateway
2012-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	can i put in dummy values and still expect it to work?
2012-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	ripthejacker	metaspike	because the address changes everytime i connect to isp and i have to put in manually
