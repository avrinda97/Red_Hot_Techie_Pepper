2006-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	Kraln		much <3
2006-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	Kraln		by the way, if you guys haven't heard of qunu, it's this free support service
2006-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	Kraln		you basically sign up and tell them what you're good ad
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	Kraln		at*
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	Kraln		and they funnel people to you
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	Kraln		it's really cool ;)
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	I signed up with qunu a few weeks ago and haven't had a single person ask me anything.  did I do something wrong?
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	Kraln	dooglus	it won't send people to you if you are set as 'away'
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	Kraln		eh
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	how can I tell if I am?
2006-06-23T11:57:00.000Z	Kraln	dooglus	did you add the q-bot to your jabber buddies?
2006-06-23T11:57:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	I added 'qunu' to my buddies
2006-06-23T11:57:00.000Z	Kraln	dooglus	does it respond if you im 'tag' to it?
2006-06-23T11:58:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	yes, it does.  big list of tags.
2006-06-23T11:58:00.000Z	Kraln	dooglus	and your nickname is dooglus on qunu?
2006-06-23T11:59:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	it is.  and I've just tagged myself as an expert in "insectwelding" which is hopefully unique.  can you look for help with that?
2006-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	Kraln	dooglus	there?
2006-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	Kraln		pm

2006-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Kraln	apparently I'm "Chris Moore" on qunu
