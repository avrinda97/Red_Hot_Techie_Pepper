2010-07-18T03:35:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	sorry, read it wrong
2010-07-18T03:36:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	from windows, I dont know.
2010-07-18T03:37:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	you could try using portable ubuntu in windows and installing remastersys in itm and then make your iso...it might just work, never know
2010-07-18T03:37:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	no
2010-07-18T03:41:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	install it properly.  even a wubi would do. (I hate wubi)
2010-07-18T03:43:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	for remastersys to work you need your usb drive with ubuntu live whatever, plus you need space for an iso of you custom install....
2010-07-18T03:44:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	so if you are running it all from a usb, forget it.  just install it and do the rest
2010-07-18T03:46:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	install it with wubi or a real install, then install remastersys then you can make a custom iso
2010-07-18T03:47:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	you could just use virtualbox also
2010-07-18T03:47:00.000Z	trickx51	duffydack	virtualbox is like wubi i take it?
2010-07-18T03:47:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	install it in a vbox, customise it, make the iso with remastersys and copy the iso to your host and burn
2010-07-18T03:48:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	uh, no its a virtual machine.
2010-07-18T03:49:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	it would be easier on you...
2010-07-18T03:49:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	IF  all you are wanting to do is make a custom iso, then ues
2010-07-18T03:50:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	using vbox you`d install it without actually installing it, to make the iso
2010-07-18T03:51:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	which you would use later to install on a real machine.
2010-07-18T03:52:00.000Z	trickx51	duffydack	I just want to make sure I have this right...from windows..install virtualbox, then use virtualbox to *install* ubuntu, then use remastersys to create an iso of the customized ubuntu to install to a USB?
2010-07-18T03:53:00.000Z	trickx51	duffydack	and remastersys is an app installed in the *install* of unbuntu in virtualbox...right?
2010-07-18T03:53:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	install vbox in windows.  install ubuntu as a guest.   install remastersys in the guest.  use it to make an iso of your guest install.  copy the iso to your host.  burn

2010-07-18T03:56:00.000Z	duffydack	trickx51	enable shared folders to copy the iso to your host.. and install guest additions
2010-07-18T03:57:00.000Z	trickx51	duffydack	thanks again...
