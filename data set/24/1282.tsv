2010-04-21T21:40:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	yes and it pings
2010-04-21T21:41:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	Okay... Have you tried `sudo apt-get update`? because if proxy settings are default as in Direct Connect, it should not be looking at the proxy sever.
2010-04-21T21:42:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	yes i did and i get the same issue
2010-04-21T21:42:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	When you go to update manager, click on settings, what is the download server?
2010-04-21T21:44:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	server for us
2010-04-21T21:45:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	Hmm.. In the network proxy preferences, what is in the ignored hosts?
2010-04-21T21:46:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	localhost, 127.0.0.1/8 and *.local
2010-04-21T21:46:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	Ok, that is good.
2010-04-21T21:49:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	What about sudo apt-get -f install -f`?
2010-04-21T21:51:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	all zeros
2010-04-21T21:51:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	Okay, so how about if we try `sudo apt-get update` again?
2010-04-21T22:04:00.000Z	dacs	crucialhoax	any other thoughts
2010-04-21T22:06:00.000Z	crucialhoax	dacs	No ideas. I have same settings, and it works.
