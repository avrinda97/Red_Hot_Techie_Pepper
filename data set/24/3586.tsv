2007-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	kayce		last time im gona ask (cuz noones answerd it yet).. do i need a /boot partition or w/e before i install? >.<    30g root, 2g swap, 217g /usr (idk what else to put it as?) 250g /home     on 2 250g hard drives
2007-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	kayce		thank you
2007-12-15T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	you don't need a separate /usr
2007-12-15T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	or mount it as /home/you/data , but lvm is pretty
2007-12-15T13:01:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	on the partition that is your root , edit /boot/grub/menu.lst ; look for the line that begins with kernel, and add noapic to the end of it
2007-12-15T13:04:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	you may have to mount it,  try in the terminal (konsole?) mount /dev/<rootdevice> -text3 /mnt , you should see the file at /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-15T13:07:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	ok, look for the line that starts with kernel, and ends with ro quiet splash (may not be in that exact order) and add noacpi to the end
2007-12-15T13:13:00.000Z	kayce	nickrud	it wont let me save the change to the menu.lst , says i dont have the permissions
2007-12-15T13:13:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	one of two things, the disk is mounted read only (mount on the command line will tell you, either rw or ro) or you need sudo
2007-12-15T13:14:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	so, umount /dev/<rootdevice> && mount /dev/<root> -text3 /mnt , check permissions again
2007-12-15T13:19:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	np, that's what this channel is for.  if you do that command,  mount should say it's rw now
2007-12-15T13:21:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	   umount /dev/<rootdevice>      then    mount /dev/<rootdevice> -text3 /mnt
2007-12-15T13:26:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	does mount show the device as rw , and mounted on /mnt ?
2007-12-15T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	for example, one partition of mine looks like this: /dev/hda8 on /home type ext3 (rw,user_xattr)  . That means it's mounted on /home, and rw (read writeable)
2007-12-15T13:29:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	that's from the output of   mount
2007-12-15T13:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	herm, not nice to paste here
2007-12-15T13:38:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	it was to stop your flood :)
2007-12-15T13:38:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	ok, the partition is not mounted, you must be in the live cd
2007-12-15T13:42:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	ok, then you will find it at /media/disk/boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-15T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	try  nano in a terminal as the editor
2007-12-15T13:45:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	apps->accessories->terminal , in there type nano /media etc
2007-12-15T13:52:00.000Z	kayce	nickrud	what do i do now? how do i save the change? or is it already saved when i type it?
2007-12-15T13:53:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	there's instructions at the bottom of the screen, but basically ctl-x and say yes to save
2007-12-15T13:54:00.000Z	nickrud	kayce	no problem, the learning curve is steep at the beginning, especially when you have kernel issues
