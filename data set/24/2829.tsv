2008-09-14T21:47:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	precede the command with an l typically
2008-09-14T21:48:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	is tht a pipe symbol
2008-09-14T21:48:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	an L
2008-09-14T21:49:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	for example, a local directory listing is lls, a local cd is lcd
2008-09-14T21:49:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	like lls ?
2008-09-14T21:50:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	but it says command not found

2008-09-14T21:51:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	yea .... i have used Secure Shell 3.3.9 for windows
2008-09-14T21:52:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	I assumed you were using ssh in Linux/Unix...
2008-09-14T21:54:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	any thing similar to that when accessing from windows ??
2008-09-14T21:55:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	You know what? I was thinking of sftp...
2008-09-14T21:55:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	why do you need to issue local commands in ssh?
2008-09-14T21:57:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	for file transfer ...... i am logged into the remote machine now using " ssh user@remotemachine"
2008-09-14T21:58:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	Secure Shell is specifically for logging into and executing commands on a remote machine and will only work as such
2008-09-14T21:58:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	ohh wouldn't scp help ???
2008-09-14T22:02:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	yea i agree sftp is a better option i just wanted to know if there are commands for file transfer when in an ssh prompt
2008-09-14T22:04:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	ssh provides scp
2008-09-14T22:05:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	but how do i use scp when i am logged into a remote system

2008-09-14T22:10:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	can u tell me how to specify the localhost ..... is it "scp filename localhost@ipaddress"
2008-09-14T22:12:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	Did you look at the second link? You shouldn't need to specify localhost...
2008-09-14T22:14:00.000Z	semanticpc	invisibleprison	the second link says hostA but in my case hostA is a localhost
2008-09-14T22:20:00.000Z	invisibleprison	semanticpc	in the example, host A is where you are copying files to...
