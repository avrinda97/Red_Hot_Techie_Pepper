2006-08-01T11:22:00.000Z	harisund		What's the difference between /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin ? I mean what get placed where and why?
2006-08-01T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	I dont know about anybody else, but I tend to put my own bash scripts in /usr/local/bin, by which I mean scripts that don't launch apps
2006-08-15T08:31:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	I customized it, not that much, just different theme, background, and gdm
2006-08-15T08:32:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	hmmm..  Iwant to remove update-manager and a ton of nonsense from my startup, but I am not able to. If I go to my sessions and see my startup tab, I don't even get the choice of removing update-manager. It is either disable or enable (and disable doesn't work across sessions)
2006-08-15T08:33:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	a lot of work but, all of the startup scripts are at /etc/init.d, you may be able to find whichever one starts update manager and delete it or move it or change it or whatever
2006-08-15T08:34:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	that's the problem. update-manager is not a service, s you won't find it in /etc/init.d. It starts only with Gnome. That's what really annoys me. If it was a /etc/init.d/ script, it would have started merely when I boot my system, which is not the case really. ....
2006-08-15T08:35:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	when my system starts, everything is perfect, I have only those processes that running that I want. When I start Gnome it starts a boatload of crap that I want.
2006-08-15T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	it may be one of those unfortunate times where the answer is "if you want that kind of configurability, you need KDE", maybe not I don't know but I am not sure where the gnome start up stuff happens
2006-08-15T08:37:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	I am afraid you might actually be right there :)
2006-08-15T08:39:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	you don't have the startup program called update-notifier, I do, seems to be the thing
2006-08-15T08:40:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	I also do?
2006-08-15T08:40:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	When I click on it, the delete optoin is greyed out.
2006-08-15T08:41:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	it disables it now, and then the program nicely runs itself. I want to know in which file these programs are listed and delete the entry from the file directory. I feel comfortable only when I do sometihng over the command line, modifying config files. GUI scares me.
2006-08-15T08:41:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	I am afraid I will eventually end up like shawnr_ here, complaining the same thing.
2006-08-15T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	yeah I feel the same generally, you could make a symbolic link for update-notifier and have it go to somewhere else
2006-08-15T08:45:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	hmm..ok ..if you find out, please leave me a message. I have to go now. Thanks a real ton for atleast chatting with me :) Nobody here seems to even bother about Gnome's customization.
2006-08-17T12:53:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	don't I know you? :)
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	for what reason
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	just curious. I compiled my firefox from source :) so I thought I would do that as well ..
2006-09-08T06:06:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	why did you compile it from source?
2006-09-08T06:08:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	hmmm.. let's just say, for fun? Well, I know it's not fun to see stuff scroll by your screen.. but I do like to read the code, see how my modifications affect it and stuff like that..and I hvae a lot of stuff compiled from source on my machine ...
2006-09-08T06:09:00.000Z	bruenig	harisund	seems easier and better systemwise to have everything tracked by apt. Although I guess if you did a check install, that still works
2006-09-08T06:09:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	yes, where possible I use checkinstall and have .deb files ... where not, well.... that is one thing that annoys me abut Linux, applications placing their files wherever they want. Most applications come with a make uninstall capability .. but for those that don't :(
2006-09-08T06:10:00.000Z	harisund	bruenig	and where possible I use ./configure --prefix=/opt/name as well....
