2009-10-28T04:05:00.000Z	crypto_		can someone help me installing bind9
2009-10-28T04:06:00.000Z	crypto_		on ubuntu
2009-10-28T04:06:00.000Z	crypto_		I want to install bind9 on ubuntu but the sudo apt-get command is giving error
2009-10-28T04:08:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	are you on jaunty? pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-10-28T04:08:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	please heed the bot's advice
2009-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	i asked if you're running jaunty and to please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list . would you please do that?
2009-10-28T04:15:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	feel free to give your paste URL in the channel.
2009-10-28T04:15:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	anyway, i've seen that already. now i wanted the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list file.
2009-10-28T04:19:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	that's not a sane list. you don't have updates or security fixes enabled.
2009-10-28T04:19:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	are you sure there isn't more? the output seems cut off.
2009-10-28T04:20:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	having jaunty-proposed enabled is a very very very bad idea.
2009-10-28T04:21:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	also, your medibuntu line says "feisty" rather than "jaunty" as it should
2009-10-28T04:21:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	remove jaunty-proposed, fix medibuntu, save, and then "sudo apt-get update". then try again installing bind9
2009-10-28T04:21:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	it may not be fixable easily, however, depending on what got installed from -proposed
2009-10-28T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	where it says "feisty", change that to "jaunty"
2009-10-28T04:30:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	have you also typed "sudo apt-get update"?
2009-10-28T04:33:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	output of "apt-cache policy libbind9-40 ; apt-cache policy bind9" please?
2009-10-28T04:37:00.000Z	LjL	crypto_	add these two lines to your sources.list, then run apt-get update again: http://paste.ubuntu.com/303199/
