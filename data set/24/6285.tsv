2006-07-31T14:56:00.000Z	OrionUser		I am
2006-07-31T14:56:00.000Z	OrionUser		ya mon
2006-07-31T14:56:00.000Z	OrionUser		springfield, mo
2006-07-31T14:58:00.000Z	OrionUser		Anyway, back to the topic : I need help! I need to find a debian/ubuntu package "php5-ftp" and I can't find it anywhere - and i fear i will be stuck trying to compile a module for hours and end up breaking our existing setup
2006-07-31T14:59:00.000Z	OrionUser		I noticed
2006-07-31T14:59:00.000Z	OrionUser		So is there a black-market version floating around on a BBS somewhere?
2006-07-31T14:59:00.000Z	OrionUser		!info php5-ftp
2006-07-31T14:59:00.000Z	OrionUser		!php5-cli
2006-07-31T15:00:00.000Z	OrionUser		If by precompiled binary you mean something real easy to run for someone who doesn't wanna break their existing php5 installation, then yes.
2006-07-31T15:00:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	I find a phpgroupware-ftp, but not php5-ftp.  Are you sure that php5-ftp is available in the ubuntu repositories (not the debian repos)?
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	OrionUser		No i'm not, but I know i'm getting this error (yes its off topic, but I asked them (#php) and they said it was a #debian question)
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	OrionUser		Fatal error: Call to undefined function ftp_connect() in /var/www
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	or perhaps the name has changed to  phpgroupware-ftp?
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	try installing phpgroupware-ftp.  It can't hurt.
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	OrionUser		I know what phpgroupware is
2006-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	OrionUser		its like an office/outlook package written in  php
2006-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	ok, but it's the only ubuntu package with php and ftp in it.
2006-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	possibly it's available for debian but not ubuntu?
2006-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	OrionUser	sethk	where is the ftp in it?
2006-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	sethk		phpgroupware-ftp is the package name
2006-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	OrionUser		ahh.. i feel slow
2006-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	OrionUser		Oh god... It wants to install php4 on top of my php5 installation to supprot phpgroupware-ftp. no, no ,no this can't be good at all
2006-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	no, definitely not
2006-07-31T15:04:00.000Z	sethk	OrionUser	sounds like there isn't a ubuntu package for it.  (Or possibly that it is in a repository other than the standard ubuntu repositories)
