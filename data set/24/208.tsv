2012-04-10T22:17:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		Hey people!
2012-04-10T22:18:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		There is no audible bell in my computer. Any idea how to configure it ?
2012-04-10T22:18:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	if it's wired then you should set that in bios
2012-04-10T22:18:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	wired? no idea. How do i check that?
2012-04-10T22:19:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	did you build it yourself?
2012-04-10T22:19:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	okay, my problem specifically is, i dont hear an alert when i get a mention/hilight in a channel/query window in irssi. How do i configure that?
2012-04-10T22:20:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	the internal speaker looks like this on most desktops http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31o15r9S5GL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
2012-04-10T22:21:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	No, its not what i want.
2012-04-10T22:21:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	if it's plugged in where it should be then you have to make sure it's enabled in your bios, then configure your IRC client to use it... I couldn't tell you how to set irssi to use it
2012-04-10T22:21:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	ok, so what 'bell' are you referring to
2012-04-10T22:21:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	I rephrase my query, how do you make irssi create a bell when i get a mention? Okay, anyone else, please?
2012-04-10T22:21:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	ah! you want a notification sound
2012-04-10T22:22:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	that was easy ;) http://pookey.co.uk/wordpress/archives/4-irssi-making-it-beep-when-your-nick-is-mentioned

2012-04-10T22:29:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	I need an 'Alert Sound' (as in Sound Preferences > choose Alert Sound in ubuntu 10.04)
2012-04-10T22:29:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	yeah, is that not what you want?
2012-04-10T22:29:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	neurochrome	any idea?
2012-04-10T22:31:00.000Z	neurochrome	sddhrthrt	there's mention of using perl scripts to play sounds when certain events happen http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/1393
