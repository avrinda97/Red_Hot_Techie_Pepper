2005-06-27T14:01:00.000Z	concept10		I dont understand the big issue about spatial mode
2005-06-27T14:02:00.000Z	delire	concept10	it's fairly polemic
2005-07-31T14:49:00.000Z	delire	concept10	i was looking at one today. the fact their such a (white) black box turns me off.
2005-07-31T14:51:00.000Z	concept10	delire	It will match my external USB drive, ist silver and white so i dont mind as much
2005-07-31T14:53:00.000Z	delire	concept10	right, i meant it in the sense of it's 'upgradeablility'. for this reason i am going to buy a shuttle PC i think. slightly larger and several times more bang for my buck.
2005-07-31T14:54:00.000Z	concept10	delire	True.  The shuttles are nice but they dont run os x (at least not yet)
2005-07-31T14:54:00.000Z	delire	concept10	well i care little with OSX, having had to work with it alot recently.
2005-07-31T14:55:00.000Z	concept10	delire	I havent had much exposure with os x, my sister has a powerbook g4 (which I gave her a ubuntu live cd and she says what do I need that for :)
2005-07-31T14:56:00.000Z	delire	concept10	of couse she does, however if she cared about raw performance this would another matter albeit.
2005-07-31T14:58:00.000Z	concept10	delire	huh?
2005-07-31T14:58:00.000Z	concept10	delire	apple has always been a hardware vendor, yes they may outsource some stuff but who doesnt ?
2005-07-31T14:59:00.000Z	delire	concept10	no they are not. they simply provide a design spec to taiwanese companies, AsusTek and Quanta to make machines for them. my Asus laptop will be very close in design to the next generation MacIntel laptops.

2005-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	delire	concept10	mcphail there are several reports suggesting it's possible to get 'unbadged' (meaning without the apple logo) laptops and mac mini's in Taiwan. illegitimately of course..
2005-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	concept10	delire	thats interesting
2005-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	concept10	delire	but you can get anything unbadged in Taiwan, even Nike shoes :)
2005-07-31T15:05:00.000Z	concept10	delire	why would you want them to? to save money?
2005-07-31T15:05:00.000Z	delire	concept10	sorry, don't understand the Q
2005-07-31T15:12:00.000Z	concept10	delire	true statement
2005-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	delire	concept10	interesting..
2005-07-31T15:21:00.000Z	delire	concept10	Debian never intended to be a 'desktop OS', it's a universal OS _whose primary purpose is to provide for outcomes like Ubuntu_
2005-07-31T15:24:00.000Z	delire	concept10	many folk here run Debian (like me, since 'Potato'). like them i find the culture of #debian generally poor, but love the community in other manifestations.
2005-07-31T15:25:00.000Z	concept10	delire	I run debian also.  I agree with you about the culture of pound debian .  Maybe I havent been around long enough
