2011-08-30T07:50:00.000Z	hetecro		But make it default
2011-08-30T07:51:00.000Z	hetecro		Yes, but Fat32 does not work for me, I have plenty of files over 2gb
2011-08-30T07:51:00.000Z	hetecro		Hm. . . Perplexing
2011-08-30T07:52:00.000Z	hetecro		But when you use certain programs, they (by default) point to your *registered* directories for docs
2011-08-30T07:53:00.000Z	hetecro		Is there any way to use the console to change the default location?
2011-08-30T07:53:00.000Z	hetecro		Ah! I see
2011-08-30T07:53:00.000Z	hetecro		Is ntfs support in Ubuntu stable enough to read and write at the same speed of ext?
2011-08-30T07:54:00.000Z	hetecro		That's why I dont like fat32
2011-08-30T07:55:00.000Z	hetecro		What about exfat? Windows 7 can be installed on it, how is the support
2011-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	hetecro		If only someone had the technical knowledge to program Windows on top of a Unix file structure like everybody else
2011-08-30T07:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	fat32 max file size is around 4Gb,  stopping the holding of DVD ISOs which are 4.7Gb
2011-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	the file extensiopn means nearlynothing in Linux, the data is looked at to determina what it is, not the extension.
2011-08-30T07:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	so saying ".r3d files" doesn't hold much weight
2011-08-30T08:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	true, the kernel and the sharing service handle it all
2011-08-30T08:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	doubt the file access time would be faster over lan with fat rather than something decent
2011-08-30T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	^
2011-08-30T08:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	storing on a lan storage is handy if you use multiple OSes though, also makes backups easier as there is only one copy
2011-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	I thought you said you had Gb ethernet?
2011-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	so if you are stuck with wifi, that's not ethernet... I'm confused
2011-08-30T08:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	i see
2011-08-30T08:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	network logic isn't what you think. Connecting 2 NICs to the same subnet causes all sorts of badness
2011-08-30T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	thats dependant on the user
2011-08-30T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	first to desktop 64bit. The name just stuck. It's likd IDE drives being called as they are. It just stuck
2011-08-30T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hetecro	easily.
