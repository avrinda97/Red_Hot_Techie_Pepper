2012-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	Eclife		Anyone out there have some time to help with a problem?
2012-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	you mean like what's the meaning of life?
2012-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	btw fyi, the meaning of life is 42.
2012-06-06T05:42:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	already new the meaning of life. Now I have harder problems to solve
2012-06-06T05:42:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	wanna take a stab at it?
2012-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	stab? that's kinda cruel i'm afraid. maybe one of can take a jab though
2012-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	once in lightdm? that's the logon screen
2012-06-06T05:44:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	you mean logon screen or "logging on"
2012-06-06T05:45:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	btw, very few people know what lightdm is (it was implemente 11.10+ and up)
2012-06-06T05:45:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	what about plain-text logon?
2012-06-06T05:45:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	dunno? how do you do that?
2012-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	did you try to ssh, and "stop lightdm"? (then try logging on plaintext?)
2012-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	if you can logon plaintext then somewhere there's a problem with X
2012-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	well you can't ?(or can you).. if ctl-alt-f1 doesnt work, then try ssh to stop lightdm
2012-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	stopping lightdm may free the keyboard
2012-06-06T05:48:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	i blieve ssh is a default service (likely installed if not, then you'll need to boot into runlevel1 )
2012-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	do you know how to edit the grub bootline dynamically?
2012-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	that's one way to get into rescue
2012-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	the grub menu says you can hit 'e'..
2012-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	no I don't
2012-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	well before hitting "enter" on the grub menu, hit 'e', then add " 1" (without quotes at the end of the "kernel XXXX XXXX XX quiet ") to the kernel bootline, after that hit F10 to boot
2012-06-06T05:59:00.000Z	jagginess	Eclife	then you can work in terminal after typing in the root password.. this will be plaintext
2012-06-06T06:00:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	I don't know if this makes a difference, but Ubuntu loads perfectly once every third try
2012-06-06T06:05:00.000Z	Eclife	jagginess	I don't know if this helps, but Ubuntu starts up fine every third try
