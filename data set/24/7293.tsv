2005-08-08T14:39:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	during install... hit ctrl+f2 and type what HrdwrBoB said
2005-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	after you've created to raid array...
2005-08-08T14:41:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	lvm?
2005-08-08T14:42:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	a kind of software raid...
2005-08-08T14:42:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	you can if you want
2005-08-08T14:42:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	no, else it wouldn't exist...
2005-08-08T14:43:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	it accomplishes bascially the same thing though
2005-08-08T14:43:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	LVM is raid without the safety...
2005-08-08T14:44:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	LVM not LGM
2005-08-08T14:45:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	the different raid levels provide safety because you're making duplicates of data... LVM doesn't do this... it just makes the drives seem as one...
2005-08-08T14:47:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	I just told you
2005-08-08T14:48:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	LVM = multiple disks functioning as one ... RAID = duplicates data across 2 or more disks to provide a way to recover from data loss
2005-08-08T15:02:00.000Z	lunitik	george___	why do you want to use RAID? you don't seem like you'd have data thats important enough (no offense intended)
