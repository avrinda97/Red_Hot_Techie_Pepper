2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	what do you mean by switch?
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	laura_		to switch tv out on
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	laura_		thanks
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	laura_		00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	laura_		thats intel, as i thought
2009-11-08T04:59:00.000Z	laura_		how do i activate the tv-out? it's vhs
2009-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	what physical connection are you using to connect to the tv?
2009-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	laura_		s-vhs
2009-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	laura_		oh no
2009-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	laura_		one girl is beginningto sleep right now :-/
2009-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	that may explain it... most systems boot at a low enough resolution to mirror the video over to a tv out.  When x gets going it's typically at a higher resolution which won't work on the tv.  the tv out can generally still be enabled, but something in the driver has to tell the chipset how to handle the reduced resolution on the TV out side of it, and I'm guessing that is what is not happening for you.
2009-11-08T05:02:00.000Z	laura_		ok Snausages, thank you. how do i go on now?
2009-11-08T05:02:00.000Z	laura_		(the tv is is a full-hd pioneer lcd, btw, so it should handle higher resolutions!)
2009-11-08T05:04:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	yes, the computer can make a hi-res signal, and yes your TV can certainly display a hi-res signal...  but that s-video connection in between is going to top out around 720x486...  quite low by comparison to either.  As far as what to do next, you may need to find a more complete or more advanced graphics driver for your chipset.  I don't know if such a thing exists or even where to look.
2009-11-08T05:05:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	you may do better in the end simply by connecting to the TV by way of VGA, DVI or HDMI
2009-11-08T05:05:00.000Z	laura_		i just changed the resolution to 640*480 to check, but there is still no way to switch
2009-11-08T05:05:00.000Z	laura_	Snausages	aint possible, just a svhs connection on this old nb
2009-11-08T05:06:00.000Z	laura_		how do i switch at all?
2009-11-08T05:06:00.000Z	laura_		theres no option or whatever in the system options
2009-11-08T05:06:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	that's where the driver I mentioned comes in
2009-11-08T05:06:00.000Z	laura_		so i need another driver for my gpu
2009-11-08T05:07:00.000Z	Snausages	laura_	you may need to find and install an alternate driver for your graphics system.  I don't know if there is one.  Another possibility- some laptops have a hotkey on them which will cause the graphics chipset to seek out external displays or force them to switch.  Dunno if this applies to you.
