2008-07-15T21:34:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	Are you confusing the wheel (admin's group) and the root?
2008-07-15T22:31:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	There are two default clients :)
2008-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	Try with Terminal services client
2008-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	If it doesn't work, go for realvnc
2008-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	Although, it worked in any combination for me
2008-07-15T22:34:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	I've figured it out. On the server i had to disable the VNC session encryption which can be set on the Advanced tab. Now i can connect via the command line with vncviewer.
2008-07-15T22:34:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	kk. good that you figured it out
2008-07-15T22:34:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	The odd thing is that the vncviewer that ships with Ubuntu doesn't support encryption
2008-07-15T22:35:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	Both of them?
2008-07-15T22:35:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	thanks.
2008-07-15T22:35:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	don't know, but vncviewer doesn't. but i guess that's ok because i'm using a ssh tunnel anyway
2008-07-15T22:37:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	Beware, there used to be a bug in vino server, which prevented one from restricting incoming connections to the localhost only in IPv4 networks on Linux machines...
2008-07-15T22:38:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	It was reported but not fixed the last time I checked the issue couple weeks ago.
2008-07-15T22:38:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	odd... but i trust my LAN and the server is behind a NAT router anyway so the port isn't reachable from the outside
2008-07-15T22:39:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	yeah, and very nasty, since I've spent half a day debugging it!
2008-07-15T22:47:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	I've been experimenting with different ones in laboratory environment, but have decided to stick to RDP in offtopic (unless it is not supported due to licensing - RealVNC then), and default Vino server with default VNC viewer in GNOME.
2008-07-15T22:41:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	is vino from RealVNC?
2008-07-15T22:42:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	You won't believe it, but Gnome now develops their own VNC-server, and they take code from RealVNC, and other projects. IMO, they are very, very wrong.
2008-07-15T22:43:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	i agree. they should offer better integration of existing projects instead of wanting to have a controllable server with a simple GUI
2008-07-15T22:44:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	true that, man
2008-07-15T22:44:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	do you run a VNC server and if so, which one? :)
2008-07-15T22:48:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	I just rarely need it, so it works OK for me.
2008-07-15T22:49:00.000Z	bartmon	macrobad	I'm not a heavy user so it suffuces for me as well. Thanks for all the info, I appreciate it!
2008-07-15T22:50:00.000Z	macrobad	bartmon	You too, it's nice to share
