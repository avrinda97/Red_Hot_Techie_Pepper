2011-07-07T00:13:00.000Z	snow_usa		I'm running vim on the server ; when I ssh to that, I don't want to pkill vim and vim the opened file again. Is there any way I can send a process (with processID) to background and fg it again ?
2011-07-07T00:13:00.000Z	snow_usa		thanks.
2011-07-07T00:15:00.000Z	snow_usa		not ssh anywhere !
2011-07-07T00:15:00.000Z	snow_usa		when you go to  your gf's house and forgot to close vim
2011-07-07T00:16:00.000Z	snow_usa		just use screen when I ssh to some other remote servers
2011-07-07T00:17:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	so what do you mean? You start a vim on your local machine, then... ?
2011-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	and forget to close it ; now, I'm at school and want to access the same file that my vim at home is opening
2011-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	in that case, when you are at school, your computer at home, is a remote machine right? If the vim session was started in screen, you could attach, and continue
2011-07-07T00:21:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	so, screen is a valid suggestion, and saying I don't use screen locally, is not a valid reply
2011-07-07T00:23:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	may be I don't understand screen quite fully
2011-07-07T00:24:00.000Z	snow_usa		all I've dome is just "screen -dr "
2011-07-07T00:24:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	it's just for that purpose you describe. You start a program in terminal (screen) and attach to that screen, continuing exactly as you left it
2011-07-07T00:25:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen
2011-07-07T00:27:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	sorry, but I should type screen, and how to attach the vim into it ?
2011-07-07T00:28:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	you type screen, and at that moment you are in a screen session. From there just type vim blah.txt and start editing
2011-07-07T00:28:00.000Z	snow_usa		oh oCean !
2011-07-07T00:28:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	then do <ctrl-a><d> to detach
2011-07-07T00:28:00.000Z	snow_usa		I have already opened vim when I was at home
2011-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	ok, in *that* case this won't help :(
2011-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	that is what I want to do
2011-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	oCean	snow_usa	but for the next time, use screen :)
2011-07-07T00:29:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	I'm always lazy to use vim on local machine
2011-07-07T00:30:00.000Z	snow_usa	oCean	via ssh is ok, since the network sometimes give me problems
