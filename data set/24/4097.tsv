2007-09-07T06:17:00.000Z	tyoc	ScorpKing	thanks for the link, I will check it out, actually I have downloaded another boot manager, I will check if that work... anyway, my problem come after switching of mother board...
2007-09-07T06:18:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	it's a common problem but can be fixed.
2007-09-07T06:19:00.000Z	tyoc	ScorpKing	I have listed from a guy that when you install, the installation "get married" with the hardware parts... thus changing my motherboard as trashed my boot
2007-09-07T06:21:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	that's pissible. go throught the link i gave you, the solution is on there.
2007-09-07T06:23:00.000Z	tyoc		OK ScorpKing, I g2 read, first I will try another thing I found, then I return back to read ;)
2007-09-07T06:23:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	might be easier to read. :)
2007-09-07T06:24:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	I changed the second drive from <code>auto-detect</code> type to <code>manual</code> and <code>LBA</code> and then both operating systems could boot from GRUB without errors.
2007-09-07T06:32:00.000Z	tyoc	ScorpKing	I see what you say... thought to my surprise I havent found in the BIOS the normal screen I remember in all the other BIOSes I have seen... I mean there is main list of devices that I can modify...
2007-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	tyoc		it is an ASUS p5B deluxe WiFi AP and the BIOS doesnt look "normall" at all
2007-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	it gets changed often but it will be there.
2007-09-07T06:34:00.000Z	tyoc	ScorpKing	I need to watch where it is, the only thing I see I can change is boot...

2007-09-07T06:35:00.000Z	tyoc	ScorpKing	 all the other options are about overclocking or change voltages and things like that
2007-09-07T06:35:00.000Z	ScorpKing	tyoc	what board do you have or what does the bios look like?
2007-09-07T06:35:00.000Z	tyoc		I havent found a screenshoot of the BIOS, my motherboard is an ASUS p5B deluxe WiFi AP
2007-09-07T06:36:00.000Z	tyoc		prior I own a gigabyte 965PDS3 that just works and have the normal main with the list of devices...
