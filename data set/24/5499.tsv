2007-07-10T16:08:00.000Z	RoundyT1		what should i learn if i want to start developing programs with gui's for ubuntu?
2007-07-10T16:08:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	What is your programming background?
2007-07-10T16:09:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, haha, not much, html like the back of my hand mostly, some php here and there...
2007-07-10T16:09:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	I'm not sure what you're trying to write, but in my experience, python and glade is not that bad
2007-07-10T16:10:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, im not sure either, haha. im just wondering where would be a good place to start...
2007-07-10T16:11:00.000Z	RoundyT1		Is ubuntu against easybuntu?
2007-07-10T16:11:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	Right, nothing is really going to be easy with no programming background, but I felt like that was comparatively easier to learn than other possibilities.
2007-07-10T16:12:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, well im going to be taking some classes soon that will hopefully get me books etc on the stuff
2007-07-10T16:12:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	You'd probably want to hit Guido's python tutorial to get a feel for how python works, then try some pyglade tutorials to get the fundamentals of gui programming with python.  It shouldn't be too hard to start with an easy project like a graphical calculator.
2007-07-10T16:14:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, what's the site? or can i just google guido's
2007-07-10T16:14:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	http://docs.python.org/tut/
2007-07-10T16:15:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, haha, nvm .... http://www.python.org/~guido/ .?
2007-07-10T16:17:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, what program should i use to start programming? like to do editing and stuff....
2007-07-10T16:17:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	I'd just start with the python cli
2007-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	Gedit will give you python syntax highlighting
2007-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, k nice
2007-07-10T16:20:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	I've mostly just used something like gedit and the command line for coding and debugging in python, but I haven't really written much substantial.  I've tried Eric, it's fairly advanced IDE for python, but it's QT based and I felt like it was a bit cluttered.  It had a fairly decent Visual Studio-like debugging functions when I last tried it, and I'd imagine it's gotten a bit better now.
2007-07-10T16:20:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html
2007-07-10T16:21:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, can i get it from the repo'
2007-07-10T16:21:00.000Z	RoundyT1		s
2007-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	They've got eric3 in the repos
2007-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	RoundyT1	adamonline46	you mean like virtual hosts?
2007-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	RoundyT1		] grimm[, thanks
2007-07-10T16:23:00.000Z	] grimm[	RoundyT1	anytime
