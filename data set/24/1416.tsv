2010-01-27T08:43:00.000Z	labose		Does anyone have any ideas how to authenticate to a windows 7 shared printer ?  I am getting the error message "Tree connect failed (NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)
2010-01-27T08:44:00.000Z	voss749	labose	make sure your windows 7 shared printer permissions are set to everyone
2010-01-27T08:46:00.000Z	labose		Thank you voss749, could you navigate me to the proper window to check that ?   I already verified passwords are off in the network sharing settings and turned on printer sharing
2010-01-27T08:47:00.000Z	labose		Also, I am trying to connect via samba option...i had it printing fine with Vista

2010-01-27T08:52:00.000Z	labose		Thanks again voss749, my Network Sharing Center settings are identical to those screenshots and I am still unable to authenticate.  I've also tried enabling the guest account, resetting the password on the admin account, and also removing the password on the admin account.  Any other ideas?
2010-01-27T08:52:00.000Z	voss749	labose	add "everyone" to the ability to print
2010-01-27T08:55:00.000Z	labose	voss749	if you are referring to the security permissions in the security tab of the printer properties...everyone has the ability to print.  I am not familiar with windows 7, if you are referring to another setting would you navigate me to the correct "everyone" setting ?
2010-01-27T08:59:00.000Z	voss749	labose	can you see on the network browsing
2010-01-27T09:00:00.000Z	labose	voss749	yes when i browse in ubuntu to add a printer i can see the win7 computer, and then it requires a username/password to go further, and everything i input gets denied.
2010-01-27T09:01:00.000Z	voss749	labose	you have to network to the printer \\computer\printer like that
2010-01-27T09:02:00.000Z	labose	voss749	i use the ubuntu add printer wizard and that is the format, expect instead of \'s there are /'s
2010-01-27T09:03:00.000Z	labose		*except
2010-01-27T09:05:00.000Z	voss749	labose	is the user you set up the share with on win7 the administrator?
2010-01-27T09:05:00.000Z	labose	voss749	yes
2010-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	voss749	labose	you may need to enter the win 7 admin username/password to access the printer depending on your security settings
2010-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	labose	voss749	there is a vista machine is also able to print with no trouble
2010-01-27T09:07:00.000Z	labose	voss749	i do attempt to enter the username/password and no matter what i put it gets denied
2010-01-27T09:07:00.000Z	voss749	labose	do you have a domain set up?
2010-01-27T09:07:00.000Z	labose	voss749	no..simple workgroup and home version of windows7
2010-01-27T09:10:00.000Z	voss749	labose	I dont have any better answers sorry
2010-01-27T09:11:00.000Z	labose	voss749	ok thank you for your help
2010-01-27T09:11:00.000Z	voss749	labose	my windows experience is primarily with winxp and it doesnt always translate to win7
