2006-03-01T11:18:00.000Z	yabba__	Gyoza	i cant reduce it with that
2006-03-01T11:18:00.000Z	yabba__		gyoza, it shows that: -> Red  1.000, Green  1.000, Blue  1.000

2006-03-01T11:19:00.000Z	Gyoza	yabba__	try typing in xgamma 0.5
2006-03-01T11:19:00.000Z	yabba__		ok
2006-03-01T11:21:00.000Z	yabba__	Gyoza	thank you, ill try to toggle it with that

2006-03-01T11:21:00.000Z	Gyoza	yabba__	yeah, maybe xgamma is more for color adjustments.
2006-03-01T11:22:00.000Z	yabba__	Gyoza	will it keep the changes after a restart?
2006-03-01T11:22:00.000Z	Gyoza	yabba__	my guess is no.
2006-03-01T11:23:00.000Z	yabba__	Gyoza	is there some kind of auto-command file where i'd have fill this command in?
2006-03-01T11:24:00.000Z	Gyoza	yabba__	I'm sorry, I don't remember.  Did the command even help at all?

2006-03-01T11:24:00.000Z	yabba__		gyoza, yes, it does :P
2006-03-01T11:24:00.000Z	Gyoza	yabba__	ah, what is the complete command that you're using?
2006-03-01T11:25:00.000Z	yabba__		gyoza, i typed xgamma gamma 0.3
2006-03-01T11:25:00.000Z	yabba__		it did help
