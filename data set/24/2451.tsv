2010-02-13T21:49:00.000Z	almark		because the parition on my first harddrive is named the ubuntu drive name I can't format the partition they are both /dev/sda3 which is weird how do I fix this?
2010-02-13T21:49:00.000Z	llutz	almark	your question makes no sense. /dev/xxxx are devices, not mount-points, use "sudo fdisk -l" to check what device your harddisk is on
2010-02-13T21:51:00.000Z	llutz	almark	you cannot have to devices with the same device-name period
2010-02-13T21:52:00.000Z	llutz	almark	check "sudo fdisk -l"
2010-02-13T21:54:00.000Z	llutz	almark	don't mount anything you want to put a filesystem on
2010-02-13T21:55:00.000Z	almark	llutz	I think I know whats going on here, it says the live cd is mounted on a ext3 but that isn't possible last night I install this cd on my hard drive just the live squash version and evendtually this live disk DVD thinks its on the hard drive I will fix this
2010-02-13T21:55:00.000Z	almark	llutz	I will format that part from Debian
2010-02-13T21:56:00.000Z	almark	llutz	thanks :)
2010-02-14T00:08:00.000Z	llutz	almark	pastebin output of "sudo fdisk -l" "mount" "cat /proc/cmdline" at paste.ubuntu.com
2010-02-14T00:10:00.000Z	almark	llutz	that didn't work I don't have paste i'm afraid on my xtrem
2010-02-14T00:10:00.000Z	llutz	almark	you are on live-cd, you are online, why won't it work?
2010-02-14T00:11:00.000Z	almark	llutz	it will I got it :)
2010-02-14T00:11:00.000Z	llutz	almark	you refuse to give relevant information since hours. nobody can help you without
2010-02-14T00:12:00.000Z	almark	llutz	I forgot how to stream a file into a log file, how is it again, use the > after the command?

2010-02-14T00:15:00.000Z	almark	llutz	http://paste.ubuntu.com/375669/
2010-02-14T00:16:00.000Z	llutz	almark	whatever you boot, that's not hte ubuntu live-cd, is it?
2010-02-14T00:24:00.000Z	almark	llutz	when I boot the computer will go into Debian on my drive, but right now i'm running off a live cd
2010-02-14T00:24:00.000Z	llutz	almark	yes, using "persistent" as option which causes the mount. edit boot-options to stop
2010-02-14T00:24:00.000Z	llutz	almark	what live-cd are you using?
2010-02-14T00:26:00.000Z	llutz	almark	ask authors how to boot "non-persistent"
2010-02-14T00:26:00.000Z	almark	llutz	They don't have a IRC channel working lol weird I will look for a forum
2010-02-14T00:27:00.000Z	almark	llutz	ok will do but I have to go somene for a bit I'll be back thanks :)
2010-02-17T14:38:00.000Z	llutz	almark	i already told you a few days ago: blame puredyn (whatever it is) for your problems, it's not supported here
