2008-05-03T20:35:00.000Z	Cowlol		Hi, I did something dumb and deletecd /etc/modprobe.d contents by mistake, and now I have all sorts of problems with network and video card and other stuff, is installing ubuntu again the only way to fix it?
2008-05-03T20:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	it may be possible to re-install some packages
2008-05-03T20:36:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	let me see
2008-05-03T20:38:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	if you can still get the computer online, you can try this command:
2008-05-03T20:38:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	dpkg -S /etc/modprobe.d | cut -f1 -d: | tr -d ',' | xargs apt-get --yes --reinstall install
2008-05-03T20:39:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	would that require an internet connection?
2008-05-03T20:39:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	yes
2008-05-03T20:39:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	it's possible to fix your network card without modprobe.d
2008-05-03T20:40:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	do you have ethernet instead of wifi?
2008-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	doubt it, I've been trying to get the network card to work for the past week, and I don't have a wired connection :(

2008-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	oh, yea, that one can be a bit tricky
2008-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	but it's not too hard
2008-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	which version of ubuntu do you have?
2008-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	Hardy, I think I'll just install 7.10 back because it worked perfectly
2008-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	what's wrong with hardy other than you deleting things? ;)
2008-05-03T20:43:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	Wireless didn't work even before I deleted things? :(
2008-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	Cowlol		And I keep getting problems with nvidia card, problems that I do solve, only to randomly get the same problem again later
2008-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	huh, I have a thinkpad with that chip, works fine on Hardy
2008-05-03T20:44:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	I don't know, I tried every solution mentioned on the forum, none worked (in fact I deleted stuff as part of a solution, except I put a * where I shouldn't
2008-05-03T20:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	Does wifi work from the Desktop live CD mode?
2008-05-03T20:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	what laptp is this?
2008-05-03T20:46:00.000Z	Cowlol	SuperQ	The live CD never worked, only the alternative CD. Also Acer Aspire 5920G
2008-05-03T20:46:00.000Z	SuperQ	Cowlol	oh, yea, not sure
