2006-10-29T09:11:00.000Z	Battousai		i burnt the image like im suppose to :D cuz when i insert it in windows it loads up
2006-10-29T09:12:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	then the cd has error loading or it does not load at all ?
2006-10-29T09:13:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	then i suggest you check your bios to see if it boots cd before the hd
2006-10-29T09:17:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	have you done what we have suggested ?
2006-10-29T09:18:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	if you are talking to someone , pls put the name in front ...
2006-10-29T09:19:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	sorry im new to mirc too
2006-10-29T09:19:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	this has nothing to do with mirc .. its irc .. anyway you confirmed the bios setting is correct ? meaning the cd before hd ?
2006-10-29T09:20:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	yes i did
2006-10-29T09:20:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	then there is no error messages or anything ? what do you see ? pls describe ?
2006-10-29T09:21:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	ok. when i insert the disc in windows it loads k-melon i think and when i restart with the disc inserted it does boot at all, just continues to windows like always
2006-10-29T09:22:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	then cd is not booted .... pls re check the bios again ? then also have you tried any other live cd ?
2006-10-29T09:24:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	well since my connection is 56k i had to start and stop a lot and sadly i dont have another live cd other then the one i have
2006-10-29T09:24:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	try this , do you have windows cd ? does it boot into installation mode or does it go into windows as usual ?
2006-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	yes windows xp disc boots ok  :'(
2006-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	do you only have one computer ? check with other machines
2006-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	well i can try it on a desktop let me see brb
2006-10-29T09:30:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	it did the same thing... doesnt boot
2006-10-29T09:30:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Battousai	then the cd is screwed .... thats all i can think of
2006-10-29T09:31:00.000Z	Battousai	wickedpuppy	that should be the answer since i have tryed everything thx for all ur help, sorry to have bothered you
