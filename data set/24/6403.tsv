2006-04-07T06:44:00.000Z	delire	axisys	gnomemeeting, camorama
2006-04-07T06:45:00.000Z	delire	axisys	many others. apt-cache search webcam
2006-04-07T06:45:00.000Z	axisys	delire	cool let me check it out
2006-04-07T06:46:00.000Z	axisys	delire	so many of them .. which is one has best review/
2006-04-07T06:47:00.000Z	delire	axisys	i like ekiga/gnomemeeting myself. camorama is pretty good also, though basic.
2006-04-07T06:47:00.000Z	axisys	delire	let me try gnomemeeting thanks.. never heard of the rest
2006-04-07T06:49:00.000Z	axisys	delire	hmm it says no input video device found
2006-04-07T06:50:00.000Z	delire	axisys	camera is plugged in and you know it works? choose video-for-linux device in preferences.. see if it's there.
2006-04-07T06:52:00.000Z	axisys	delire	camera wors.. i tooks soo many movies and pics and uploaded to my laptop.. now i connected as PC cam mode
2006-04-07T06:52:00.000Z	axisys	delire	v4l and v4l2 none detects it
2006-04-07T06:55:00.000Z	delire	axisys	that's weird i'd try camorama and see how far you get..
2006-06-02T07:03:00.000Z	delire	axisys	hmm seems cdrecord is playing up. this was with 'sudo gnomebaker'?
2006-06-02T07:04:00.000Z	axisys	delire	i called from application menu
2006-06-02T07:05:00.000Z	delire	axisys	try it again from the terminal (out of interest). 'sudo gnomebaker'
2006-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	axisys	delire	now i get this error http://pastebin.com/752583
2006-06-02T07:09:00.000Z	delire	axisys	it looks to me like gnomebaker is open at the same time somewhere else.
2006-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	axisys	delire	hmm let me try again
2006-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	axisys	delire	same error
2006-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	delire	axisys	were you burning CD's ok on Breezy?
2006-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	axisys	delire	yeap
2006-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	delire	axisys	hmm. i'd tell the folk in #ubuntu-devel that you can no longer burn CD's after upgrade. i'd also make a forum post about this. it's a rare problem but important nonetheless.
2006-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	axisys	delire	thnx
2006-06-02T07:14:00.000Z	delire	axisys	sorry i can't help more. there will be a fix. there always is.
