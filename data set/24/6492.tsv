2005-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	depends on your definition of 'best'

2005-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	I think it's xvlc
2005-10-27T08:12:00.000Z	alumno	_iGadget_	 vlc for ubuntu ? :S i can t find :S on videlan.org/vlc :S
2005-10-27T08:12:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	geez... ever heard of apt? :p
2005-10-27T08:14:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	there's somthing like a 'packet manager' embedded into your ubuntu gnome desktop. Try finding that one first, the looking for anything called vlc in there.
2005-10-27T08:15:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	there are several ways of invoking the packet manager... and breezy has a very easy one installed
2005-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	did you get it trough the packet manager as I told you to?
2005-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	alumno	_iGadget_	 videolan.org/vlc last one i download
2005-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	NO... get it trough the packet manager, like I told you :)

2005-10-27T08:45:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	7 years here... still don't have a clue of what I'm doing :)
2005-10-27T08:51:00.000Z	alumno	_iGadget_	 i get it from synaptic vlc now i msut to isntall it right ?
2005-10-27T08:52:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	if you let synaptic download and install vlc for you, then it should already be in your menu...
2005-10-27T08:52:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	this is Ubuntu/Debian linux... no need for separate downloads / installs :)
2005-10-27T08:55:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	most of the graphical tools on linux have console / text based tools behind them. This is convenient when you're running a server for example.
2005-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	_iGadget_	alumno	isn't it there in your menu?
2005-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	alumno	_iGadget_	 i cant see it aplicacion sounds no vlc palyer
