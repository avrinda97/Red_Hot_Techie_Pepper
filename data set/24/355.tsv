2011-10-30T03:30:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	well does it say GLX with xdpyinfo? (xdpyinfo |grep -i glx)
2011-10-30T03:30:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	It says GLX and SGI-GLX
2011-10-30T03:31:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	that's good news..
2011-10-30T03:31:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	And what about bad news ?
2011-10-30T03:32:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	try this-> apt-get install mesa-utils.. then as normal user -> glxgears <enter>
2011-10-30T03:32:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	see if that gear animation plays smoothly.. if it doesn't.. then there's something wrong..
2011-10-30T03:32:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	Seems to play really smooth :)
2011-10-30T03:33:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	that's godo
2011-10-30T03:33:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	um.. it's probably something which i'm afraid to go into.. quite a few directions.. i'm betting it's the flash plugin
2011-10-30T03:34:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	did u try google chrome ?
2011-10-30T03:34:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	it's supposed to have flash builtin
2011-10-30T03:34:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	Using Google Chrome, but it doesn't have a built in flash player anymore, so i downloades libflashplayer.so from adobe website, and put it into /opt/google/chrome/plugins/
2011-10-30T03:35:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	did u try getting a 32-bit webbrowser working with 32bit flash?
2011-10-30T03:35:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	What's point of getting 32bit software on Ubuntu X64 ?
2011-10-30T03:36:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	well if that's your only way to get smooth flash.. just a thought..
2011-10-30T03:36:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	as i said i'm afraid to get into directions.. it may even be your driver..
2011-10-30T03:36:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	but your video driver shows everything normal..
2011-10-30T03:36:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	is the audio croppy btw? (pulseaudio should be installed)
2011-10-30T03:37:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	Don't know what means word "Croppy" but as I said video is a second or two lagging for the video :)
2011-10-30T03:39:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	what did u use? apt-get install flashplugin-installer ?
2011-10-30T03:40:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	No, as I Said i downloaded file from adobe website
2011-10-30T03:41:00.000Z	yagoo	hoppipolla	try removing that file/move it someplace else-- then try that apt-get command i gave ya
2011-10-30T03:50:00.000Z	hoppipolla	yagoo	Same problem :)
