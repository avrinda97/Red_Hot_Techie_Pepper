2007-10-30T05:49:00.000Z	nemik		Q_Continuum: did it work?
2007-10-30T05:49:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	I changed it, I think - what was the command again?  didn't save it in my text file :-/
2007-10-30T05:49:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	oh yea, no display heading for you. hang on i'll post my xorg.cong
2007-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	I ran: xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1600x1200 --right-of VGA-0.  Results: I now have the left screen fine, and the right has about 25% (left edge) as an extended display - but the right 75% is corrupt
2007-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	I substituted 1600x1200 for 1024x768 though, 1600x1200 is native for both.
2007-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	yea it is corrupt because your wallpaper is small. but if you drag windows to that region it is fine, no?
2007-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	No, I get a 'ghosting' effect - every so many pixels it stops it.  I'll see if I can get a screenshot real quick.
2007-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	got it.  Going to upload, have to find ftp client lol
2007-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	i know i get the same, don't worry about screenshot
2007-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	Ok - idea on a fix?
2007-10-30T05:54:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	i think that effect is normal because your wallpaper does not go that far for stretching
2007-10-30T05:54:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	get a bigger wallpaper? not sure. but you now have dual-screens. that's as good as i got it too and it's fine
2007-10-30T05:55:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	what if you maximize a window in the region with the corruption. is it OK then? can the window be seen without problems?
2007-10-30T05:55:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	no, then its about the left 66%
2007-10-30T05:56:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	hmmm not sure then. i suggest posting in forum about it. this is as far as i can take you i'm afraid
2007-10-30T05:56:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	it already had the 'virtual 1600 1200' so I figured it matched.
2007-10-30T05:57:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	any idea how to launch the new "x crashed, time to get it working again" new GUI?
2007-10-30T05:57:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	yea it is correct section. that fact that the command even ran and split it means you did something right
2007-10-30T05:58:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	'xrandr --output VGA --off' to turn it off and go back to normal
2007-10-30T05:58:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	where VGA is your external
2007-10-30T05:59:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	how can I renable it, but in mirrored mode?
2007-10-30T05:59:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	nemik	(which is how it was, before I started messing with it)
2007-10-30T05:59:00.000Z	nemik	Q_Continuum	run xrandr -help and see commands? i'm sure theres something for mirrored
