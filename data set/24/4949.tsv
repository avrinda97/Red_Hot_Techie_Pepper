2006-12-05T15:14:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere		HOKAY, SO: I try to mount the drive, and nothing but this happens: "mount: special device dev/hdb1 does not exist"
2006-12-05T15:14:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere		why?
2006-12-05T15:15:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	dev/hdb1 won't exist should be /dev/hdb1 unless you miss-typed
2006-12-05T15:16:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	thanks
2006-12-05T15:16:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	Couldn't mount device '/dev/hdb1': Invalid argument
2006-12-05T15:16:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	is that bad?
2006-12-05T15:16:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	how are you trying to mount it?
2006-12-05T15:17:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	with the command line
2006-12-05T15:17:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	sudo ntfsmount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
2006-12-05T15:18:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	you should not mount anything to /mnt anyways it's mount ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/<folder> unless your using ntfs-3g then replace ntfs with ntfs-3g
2006-12-05T15:18:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	i'll try that, thanks
2006-12-05T15:19:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	sudo: ntfs-3gmount: command not found
2006-12-05T15:19:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	mount ntfs /dev/hdb1 /mnt/<folder not sure where your getting the mount in the filesystem
2006-12-05T15:20:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	I'm lost.
2006-12-05T15:20:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	you don't type in ntfs-3gmount it's just ntfs-3g
2006-12-05T15:21:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	The device '/dev/hdb1' doesn't have a valid NTFS. Maybe you selected the wrong device? Or the whole disk instead of a partition (e.g. /dev/hda, not /dev/hda1)? Or the other way around?
2006-12-05T15:22:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	try it with ntfs but sounds like to me that hard drive filesystem is broken
2006-12-05T15:25:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	that its looking for ntfs filesystem which your disk probably doesn't have or the filesystem is messed up
2006-12-05T15:25:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	how would i format it to ext-3?
2006-12-05T15:27:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	make2fs -j /dev/hdb1
2006-12-05T15:28:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	it didn't work,
2006-12-05T15:28:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	did it say invalid permissions?
2006-12-05T15:29:00.000Z	_coolNICKhere	kitche	it said command not found
2006-12-05T15:30:00.000Z	kitche	_coolNICKhere	you have to use sudo
