2006-05-11T07:30:00.000Z	Das		I atempted to instal hoary on my computer, when I did I got an error installing the base componets, thinking it was the disk I tried again with a new Breezy I still got an error while installing. I got "Error downloading zlib1g", "Error installing core packages", and "error (returned error 2)"
2006-05-11T07:31:00.000Z	Das		Could it be my computer is too old? XP installed on it just fine
2006-05-11T07:32:00.000Z	Das		Anyone?
2006-05-11T07:33:00.000Z	dli	Das	state your question again?
2006-05-11T07:33:00.000Z	Das	dli	[18:30]  <Das> I atempted to instal hoary on my computer, when I did I got an error installing the base componets, thinking it was the disk I tried again with a new Breezy I still got an error while installing. I got "Error downloading zlib1g", "Error installing core packages", and "error (returned error 2)"
2006-05-11T07:34:00.000Z	dli	Das	okay, download the breezy iso image again, check md5sum, and burn it at 4x speed, with "Verification"
2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	Das	dli	The hoary disk I used worked on an install on another computer, so I'm starting to think it's the computer. Are there minumum requirments for Ubuntu?
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	dli	Das	pentium ?
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	Das	dli	3
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	dli	Das	I don't know XP
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	dli	Das	you want to install ubuntu on a 385?
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	dli	Das	386
2006-05-11T07:37:00.000Z	dli	Das	yes, that's the correct way to do it
2006-05-11T07:37:00.000Z	Das	dli	I believe its 386
2006-05-11T07:37:00.000Z	dli	Das	how much RAM do you have?
2006-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	Das	dli	216 I think
2006-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	dli	Das	probably, it's not a 386
2006-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	Das	dli	Should I download a different iso?
2006-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	dli	Das	download breezy
2006-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	Das	dli	I did
2006-05-11T07:40:00.000Z	dli	Das	check md5sum of the .iso
2006-05-11T07:40:00.000Z	Das	dli	How do I do that?
2006-05-11T07:42:00.000Z	Das	dli	md5sum?
2006-05-11T07:43:00.000Z	dli	Das	google md5sum
