2010-09-14T05:40:00.000Z	looter		hello all.  I am trying to install eclipse 3.5 which is a newer version not in the repos but I am having some trouble.  I have untarred the archive and I see the eclipse executable but everytime I try to run it from the command prompt I get a message saying eclipse is not installed.  anyone help?
2010-09-14T05:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	looter	you probably need to install it
2010-09-14T05:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	looter	it's likely that it requires some sort of configuration to work
2010-09-14T05:43:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	 the tutorial online I am following just says to create a launcher for it point to that executable....what am I missing?
2010-09-14T05:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	looter	well, i'm assuming that you have all the java requirements installed
2010-09-14T05:43:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	correct
2010-09-14T05:44:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	i believe its Sun Java anyway to confirm for sure?
2010-09-14T05:45:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	java version "1.6.0_20"
2010-09-14T05:45:00.000Z	looter		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02)
2010-09-14T05:45:00.000Z	looter		Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 16.3-b01, mixed mode)
2010-09-14T05:45:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the eclipse from the repositories works fine with openjdk
2010-09-14T05:46:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	i am trying to install Android SDK and it recommends 3.4 or greater
2010-09-14T05:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding		So don't use those plugins?
2010-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	thx for your help I am gonna go give it a whirl
2010-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding		I don't see what this has to do with looter's error
2010-09-14T05:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding		Anyway, isn't the version of Eclipse in lucid 3.5?
2010-09-14T05:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding		That's what I have installed.
2010-09-14T05:49:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	same thing.  I am not getting anything when I click on it from nautilus and am getting the same message when I run from command line.  Might I have to make the eclipse file executable somehow?
2010-09-14T05:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	looter	it should be executable already
2010-09-14T05:50:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	thats what I was thinking but it is behaving like it isn't.  I am really close here has to be something really minor I am missing
2010-09-14T05:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	looter	I can tell you that I have the Android SDK working fine on the Eclipse from the repos, which is 3.5.2
2010-09-14T05:51:00.000Z	looter		hmm
2010-09-14T05:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding		!ubuntu+1 | Tempus_Fugit
2010-09-14T05:51:00.000Z	looter	tensorpudding	well shit then
