2007-01-06T17:46:00.000Z	anorexicpillow		is there a way to import my appointments from Evolution to Mozilla Sunbird?
2007-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	did you run sunbird, and try its import function?
2007-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	probably in .evolution somewhere?
2007-01-06T17:49:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	/home/your user name
2007-01-06T08:06:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	yes, it is called suntray.
2007-01-06T08:07:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	I'm not sure, I just found it while googling for a fix for my sunbird. Did you get your calendar imported?
2007-01-06T08:09:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	cool, you can find start up info with a google search.
2007-01-06T08:10:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	was suntray listed by synaptic?
2007-01-06T08:11:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	ok, I didn't explore it myself, good luck.
2007-01-06T08:13:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	did you get sunbird listed in your apps menu?
2007-01-06T08:14:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	how did you do that?
2007-01-06T08:14:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	ok, I go hunting for it.
2007-01-06T08:15:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	Ok, I probably saw it earlier, but at the time, I couldn't get sunbird to open, so I skipped it.
2007-01-06T08:18:00.000Z	anorexicpillow	n2diy	here is alltray http://alltray.sourceforge.net/downloads.html do you mind telling me how i can install it?
2007-01-06T08:19:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	wait, let me take a look at it.
2007-01-06T08:20:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	follow the link labeled Ubuntu Repos
2007-01-06T08:23:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	if you have sunbird in your menu, you should be able to click on it, and drag it to the tray.
2007-01-06T08:25:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	you can run it in the background with sunbird &
2007-01-06T08:27:00.000Z	anorexicpillow	n2diy	it doesnt seem to be working
2007-01-06T08:27:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	let it cook a while, mine took a while.
2007-01-06T08:29:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	?
2007-01-06T08:30:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	should have done something by now, shure it isn't open, and sitting on your task bar?
2007-01-06T08:31:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	try what again, it is open?
2007-01-06T08:32:00.000Z	n2diy	anorexicpillow	if it is open, the command was succesful, you can go back into the terminal, and use normally now.
