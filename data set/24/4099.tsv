2007-07-13T14:07:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		I managed to erase my CP partition, and then Ubuntu wouldn't boot up.
2007-07-13T14:07:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		XP* partition,
2007-07-13T14:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	You probably wiped your MBR with your XP partition.  Simply reinstalling GRUB to the MBR (first link of !grub) should fix it
2007-07-13T14:08:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	I'm kinda worried right now. Another hour staring at the lame XP setup screen makes me wary of trying it out again.
2007-07-16T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	They're very different.  Completely different software.  You could check your sources.list, or if you've got a question as to whether a particular package is in universe or multiverse, you can check that through an apt frontend
2007-07-16T08:37:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	my sources.list?
2007-07-16T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	/etc/apt/sources.list, it tells you where to look for the repositories
2007-07-16T08:39:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	How does this tell me if I'm on universe or multiverse?
2007-07-16T08:40:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	Sorry about the stupid questions; I'm a bit new to Ubuntu.
2007-07-18T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	You'd be hearing that Linux is better than Windows.  Not specifically Ubuntu itself.  And with Linux, more of the regular OS stuff is more useful to programmers.
2007-07-18T12:56:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	Ah.
2007-07-18T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	of course, most programmers in windows install some portion of the standard *nix toolchain when programming on windows anyway.
2007-08-02T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	windows only installs to partitions you tell it to.  You'll want to give windows a partition (pre-partitioned) beforehand, and then you'll need to reinstlal GRUB later.  but that's it
2007-08-02T12:58:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	How may I go about partioning this space for WinXP before I insert my WinXP CD? I only need about 5 GB (whatever is enough to run XP and DaemonTools)
2007-08-02T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	any liveCD will be able to do it (if you've got more than one HDD, you may be able to do it without the live CD too)
2007-08-02T12:59:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	Wait. This is if I have Ubuntu installed BEFORE XP, yes?
2007-08-02T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	right.  You can't make changes to drives that are mounted
2007-08-02T13:02:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	So I could just shut-down my PC right now, pop in the WindowsXP install CD, install it, and it won't touch my Linux partition? (assuming I've already partitioned a separate section for Windows.) And then once Windows is installed, pop in a LiveCD, and reinstall/reconfigure GRUB.
2007-08-02T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	Yeah, if you've got space for it, windows only touches the partitions you tell it to
2007-08-02T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	that's where the live CD comes into play
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	you should do it in a query, not spam the channel
2007-08-22T10:25:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	query?
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z	Flannel	ThanatosDrive	/msg ubotu [whatever] 
2007-08-22T10:26:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	Flannel	Ah, thanks.
