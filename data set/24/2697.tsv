2010-11-01T03:08:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	Pipe the command into less.
2011-06-30T23:50:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-06-30T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	If you issue a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, and there is nothing to upgrade, then nothing will be upgraded.
2011-09-07T05:44:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	Do you see evidence in /var/log/syslog that the cron job is actually running?
2011-09-07T05:45:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	one sec
2011-09-07T05:46:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	it's running...just exiting with error status 1
2011-09-07T05:47:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	You may need to provide the absolute path to xplanet.
2011-09-07T05:47:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	I installed it from apt...where would it likely be?
2011-09-07T05:48:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	/usr/bin/xplanet
2011-09-07T05:49:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	thank you...approaching a running time now so il let you know if it works..
2011-09-07T05:51:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	it didn't work :(
2011-09-07T05:51:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	Do you have an encrypted home?
2011-09-07T05:52:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	I'm getting this: Sep  7 02:40:01 Bella cron[1077]: (monotoko) RELOAD (crontabs/monotoko)
2011-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	thats fine.  At the end of your command, can you put the following: 2> /home/monotoko/cronlog
2011-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	sure...does the file need to exist or will it create it?
2011-09-07T05:54:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	it will create it
2011-09-07T05:56:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	Error: Can't create /home/monotoko/Downloads/sunrise/earth_1024x512.png. Exiting from DisplayOutput.cpp at line 69
2011-09-07T05:57:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	Does /home/monotoko/Downloads/sunrise/ exist? remember that Linux filesystems are case-sensitive.
2011-09-07T05:58:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	it does indeed...was one of the first things I checked
2011-09-07T05:59:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	damn! The file it's trying to overwrite is owned by root >< sorry about that... :$
2011-09-07T06:00:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	ah!
2011-09-07T06:00:00.000Z	Pici	Monotoko	My next step would have been to test whether you needed to set DISPLAY, but that didn't seem right to me.
2011-09-07T06:01:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	nah...I could run the same command from the terminal...problem was I left root up after a "sudo su" earlier
2012-04-26T21:43:00.000Z	Monotoko	Pici	got it! I was looking for that command :)
