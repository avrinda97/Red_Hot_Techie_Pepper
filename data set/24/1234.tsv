2010-07-17T21:20:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	an other option is to delete the files by inode number
2010-07-17T21:20:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	that sounds viable.  I don't know how ot do that either though.
2010-07-17T21:21:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	ls -ali will list the files with the inodenumbers. Use find . -inum <inodenumber> -exec rm {} \;  You might want to try with "ls" and not "rm" though
2010-07-17T21:29:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	how many are left? What is the error you get?
2010-07-17T21:30:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	It's difficult to tell how many there are, since I can't look inside any of the folders.
2010-07-17T21:30:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	removing the folders is not an option? Or also weird foldernames?
2010-07-17T21:31:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	the files contain illegal characters, and windows and ubuntu hate that.
2010-07-17T21:31:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	the FOLDER names contain illegal characters?
2010-07-17T21:32:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	it's a mix of files and folders.
2010-07-17T21:33:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	I'm still curious what the errormessage is when you do ls -ali
2010-07-17T21:34:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	something like "ls cannot access the file: input/output error"
2010-07-17T21:35:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	hard to work with "something like" errors, sorry. Anyway, it is not an option to reformat the drive?
2010-07-17T21:36:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	it would be difficult.  I'd have to take drives out of every machine around here to scrounge up enough space.  That or just buy a 500gb to put them on.  I'll use it eventually.
2010-07-17T21:37:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	sorry, I think I missed the point. I thought you wanted to erase everything, why would you need to find space from additional drives?
2010-07-17T21:39:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	it's my fault, I didn't make it clear.  I have a folder (named '1') that contains a bunch of files and folders that contain illegal characters (binary and such), and windows and ubuntu don't know how to deal with them.  However, the rest of the disk has all my files on it, that i would have to move in order to format.
2010-07-17T21:40:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	understood. You could remove the folder and all of its contents at once using "rm -r foldername" Or is '1' also invalid as a name?
2010-07-17T21:41:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	windowserUSUL, let me try just "rm -r 1"
2010-07-17T21:43:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	windowserUSUL, rm cannot remove '1': read only file system.
2010-07-17T21:45:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	might be a filesystemproblem after all. See output "mount" - is it really readonly?
2010-07-17T21:46:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	mount says it's 'rw'
2010-07-17T21:47:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	however mkdir fails for the same reason: "Read only filesystem"
2010-07-17T21:49:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	sorry, I don't know why that is. Maybe you find some more help here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
2010-07-17T21:51:00.000Z	zachlr	oCean_	thanks.  I'll look into it.  Worst case scenario I'll get a 500gb drive to move my files to, and format the original.  fat32 sucks anyway.
2010-07-17T21:52:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr	okay. Good luck
