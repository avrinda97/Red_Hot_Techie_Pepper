2008-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	it doesn't really matter what brand the computer is
2008-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	I've never heard of a Dell computer that doesn't allow you to change boot order, and that's really all you need so you can install ubuntu
2008-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	thats one thing I will not do is change the boot order in bios
2008-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	erm, any reason for that?
2008-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	I am confused alittle
2008-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	well I am trying to get grub to boot from windows boot loader
2008-04-14T09:11:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	when I try to load file ubuntu.bin or bootsect.lnx all I get is GRUB and frezzes
2008-04-14T09:13:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	that's over my head, sorry
2008-04-14T09:13:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	and I used sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/home/username/Desktop/ubuntu.bin bs=512 count=1
2008-04-14T09:14:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	do you have an Idea how I can get windows to boot grub?
2008-04-14T09:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	no, i did it the other way
2008-04-14T09:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	i have grub boot windows
2008-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	I have went that way and windows gave me sh** fits about it
2008-04-14T09:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	I just installed Ubuntu first, then installed windows, then re-wrote grub and chainloaded to windows XP
2008-04-14T09:17:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	that also lets me hibernate windows, since it goes to grub first and won't force me to resume my hibernation
2008-04-14T09:18:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	well I don't use hybernation and windows I use it more often than linux
2008-04-14T09:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	regardless, i find it easier just to install grub and chainload windows xp
2008-04-14T09:19:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	I use linux to play some games and other project
2008-04-14T09:20:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	I have switched to linux full-time now, windows is only for games and some windows only apps i need for work
2008-04-14T09:21:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	well I am looking the other way so when windows does need to be reinstalled all I have to do is add the line to the bootloader then I get linux back
2008-04-14T09:21:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	I personally would find it easier to reinstall grub, all you have to do is run grub, root (hdX,Y), setup (hdX)
2008-04-14T09:21:00.000Z	dmsuperman	shadow420	otherwise you have to re-find the ubuntu.bin file again don't you?
2008-04-14T09:22:00.000Z	shadow420	dmsuperman	I keep a copy on my external HD
