2009-11-20T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Was it an audio CD?
2009-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	indeed they are
2009-11-20T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Brasero itself won't even open it?
2009-11-20T11:03:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	No, Brasero is the _only_ thing that will open it.
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	I have a crazy idea to try if you get really desparate :)
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	hahaha alright. of course I could just burn the CDs but that'd be a big defeat for me
2009-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Desparate enough to try my crazy idea yet? :)
2009-11-20T11:29:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	I definitely am. Hit me
2009-11-20T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	sudo losetup -r /dev/loop0 /path/to/file.bin
2009-11-20T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Then tell a cd ripping app that your cdrom drive is /dev/loop0
2009-11-20T11:32:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	oooh I like it
2009-11-20T11:33:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	alright the loop is set up. Rubyrip doesn't let me do anything if I choose /dev/loop0 as the drive. I shall try a different app
2009-11-20T11:37:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	Tried abcde (nice CLI tool). It says "CD could not be read. Perhaps there's no CD in the drive?"
2009-11-20T11:41:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	Billiard, Geistanon: Thanks for all your help guys, but I think I'll delete these useless images and wait till next week to rip these CDs proper. It's a shame, and I came close with the bin2iso/bchunk wav output combo (you can hear the music faintly under lots of static), so I'd call that a partial victory :) Cheers
2009-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Try audacity as a last ditch effort before you give up
2009-11-20T11:42:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	use audacity how?
2009-11-20T11:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	File > Input > audio
2009-11-20T11:43:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	yeah lol but I mean on what file...the WAVs I got?
2009-11-20T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	On the .bin, it probably won't work, and even then it might be one long audio file but it's worth a try
2009-11-20T11:44:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	ok
2009-11-20T11:46:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	if I import it using Import > Raw Data and the default options, I get the same result as the WAV files: very loud digital-sounding static with the music faint in the background
2009-11-20T11:46:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	so something along the way here must be close but not quite right
2009-11-20T11:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	noir	Did you try importing as audio rather than "raw data"?
2009-11-20T11:47:00.000Z	noir	Jordan_U	yes, nothing happens if I do that. Says "Audacity did not recognize the type of the file. If it is uncompressed, try importing it using 'Import Raw.'"
