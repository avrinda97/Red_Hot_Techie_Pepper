2009-01-28T01:27:00.000Z	MikyMouse		Is there anyway to disable compiz but keep the sadows..? with compiz I really get sometimes weir behaivours with the text in the windows (it get screwd up while scrolling)
2009-01-28T01:27:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Not really, no.
2009-01-28T01:28:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	so it is only possible to have shadows with compiz???
2009-01-28T01:28:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Shadows in the "darken the next window under" sense requires compositing, which is what compiz does.. it's not really compiz' fault, as the problems are due to DRI1 being over-extended
2009-01-28T01:29:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Lots of other window managers bake shadows into the window decorations, but those just look the same regardless of other windows
2009-01-28T01:29:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	One option is to wait. DRI2 will eventually fix this.
2009-01-28T01:29:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Another is to switch to an nvidia gpu, as they've hacked around the issues. Mostly.
2009-01-28T01:29:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	well actually I have a NVIDIA GPU
2009-01-28T01:30:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	but I have to put the Visual Effects to NONE otherwise I get sometimes annoying efects on the text when scrolling
2009-01-28T01:30:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Unavoidable. Sorry.
2009-01-28T01:30:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	...mybe time to switch to KDE since I don't have problems there
2009-01-28T01:31:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Er, yeah, because KDE ships with those effects off
2009-01-28T01:31:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	actually I tried KDE with shadows and no problem
2009-01-28T01:31:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	but I like more GNOME
2009-01-28T01:32:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Well, are they the sort of shadows where the shadow actually lets the windows below shine through?
2009-01-28T01:33:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	and it is specialy annoying with PUTTY since half of the window doesn't redraw
2009-01-28T01:37:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	You can buy an nvidia card
2009-01-28T01:38:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Or switch to a WM where shadows just aren't an issue, like xmonad ;)
2009-01-28T01:38:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	I already told you that I am currently using an NVIDA card
2009-01-28T01:38:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Oh, you did? Hum.
2009-01-28T01:38:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	with the latest drivers from the repositories
2009-01-28T01:40:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	GeForce 8400M GS running on 177.82 drivers
2009-01-28T01:41:00.000Z	Baughn	MikyMouse	Sorry, then, can't help. I don't go for eyecandy myself, and the nvidia drivers /do/ have problems with compiz.
2009-01-28T01:42:00.000Z	MikyMouse	Baughn	ok, thanks, I like the balance; Functionallity + Style
