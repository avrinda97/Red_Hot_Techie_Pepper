2006-05-11T11:55:00.000Z	verve		hi, had a question.. can the live cd versions be installed onto the hard disk? is that an option?
2006-05-11T11:55:00.000Z	verve		or it's either install version or livecd version
2006-05-11T11:56:00.000Z	harisund	verve	Unless you have a Dapper LiveCD, you can't use the other live CDs to install.
2006-05-11T11:56:00.000Z	verve		a Dapper LiveCD, eh?
2006-05-11T11:56:00.000Z	verve		what might that be?
2006-05-11T11:57:00.000Z	verve		what about kubuntu?
2006-05-11T11:58:00.000Z	harisund	verve	kubuntu follows the same pattern .
2006-05-11T11:58:00.000Z	verve		a
2006-05-11T11:58:00.000Z	verve		ah*
2006-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	harisund	verve	every version of Ubuntu that has been official released so far have come with an installCD and a LiveCD. The latest version that has not yet been officially released (due June) has the capability of a harddisk installation from the LiveCD itself.
2006-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	harisund	verve	and it goes for kubuntu too..
2006-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	verve		how do livecds work anyway? i've never used one.. how does it store, like.. user information?
2006-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	verve		:P
2006-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	harisund	verve	I am inclined to think the computer memory is used for that. Volatile naturally, so you can't save anything across sessions.
2006-05-11T12:00:00.000Z	verve		yeah
2006-05-11T12:00:00.000Z	verve		's what i figured, wasn't sure though
2006-05-11T12:00:00.000Z	harisund		Typically verve, they are used for purposes like checking if every hardware you have is recognized and works 'out of the box'.
2006-05-11T12:00:00.000Z	harisund		If you know some hardware (printer, wireless card etc..) works with the LiveCD, you can breathe a sigh of relief and install it, knowing that you wouldn't have to spend time getting the hardware to work
2006-05-11T12:01:00.000Z	harisund		Really Madpilot? Wow .. that sounds neat
2006-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	verve		i'm in FreeBSD right now.. just tired of lack of support for it.. games, etc..
2006-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	harisund		awesome... Dapper continues to surprise and amaze me daily
2006-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	verve		not its fault, by any means
2006-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	harisund	verve	if you are a freeBSD user, you will have no trouble at all with ubuntu. To begin with you will be familiar with the command line and that is totally great :)
2006-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	verve	harisund	yep, heh
