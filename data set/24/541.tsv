2012-03-17T23:21:00.000Z	iwface		hi, how to create the home folder without reinstalling??  have a /home partition specifically for this
2012-03-17T23:23:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	you know the root password?
2012-03-17T23:23:00.000Z	iwface	waperboy	just installed 12.04 and set the home folder in a separate partition i had previously
2012-03-17T23:23:00.000Z	iwface	waperboy	accidentally, deleted the home folder with my username, the partition is still there but the folder is gone
2012-03-17T23:24:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	create a new user
2012-03-17T23:24:00.000Z	iwface		haz31nut: i know the password, and the file system is intact, just doesn't log in because it lacks a home folder. have to login as guest
2012-03-17T23:25:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	at the grub menu boot the recovery console
2012-03-17T23:25:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	useradd iwface
2012-03-17T23:26:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	then reboot. you should get the iwface user in the login screen
2012-03-17T23:26:00.000Z	iwface	waperboy	tried to copy the home folder from a guest session, which is stored in /tmp, into the separate partition, but it doesnt work as it lacks the configuration files with my username
2012-03-17T23:27:00.000Z	iwface		so i guess reinstalling is the best shot??
2012-03-17T23:28:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	I just told you how to do it.
2012-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	at the grub menu boot the recovery console
2012-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	useradd iwface
2012-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	then reboot. you should get the iwface user in the login screen
2012-03-17T23:34:00.000Z	iwface		haznut: the system boots to the login screen, my username is there, hit the passwd and then comes back to the login screen
2012-03-17T23:35:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	you don;t get a grub menu with option to select recover or do a memtest?
2012-03-17T23:35:00.000Z	iwface		haz31nut: yes but the issue is not at the grub menu
2012-03-17T23:36:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	I know. I'm telling yo how to create a new user, which will crate a new home folder.
2012-03-17T23:37:00.000Z	iwface		haz31nut: by booting the recovery console? will it ask me to create a new user?
2012-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	iwface		haz31nut: never used the recovery console, so dont know what it does
2012-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	no, it will ask for root password. then drop you to shell prompt where you will type "useradd iwface"  without quotes or whatever username you want.
2012-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	iwface		haz31nut: that seems a proper workaround!
2012-03-17T23:39:00.000Z	haz3lnut	iwface	good luck
