2011-01-06T23:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	next time - put your question all on one line.  What error are you getting?
2011-01-06T23:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	"sudo apt-get install dkms" then try again
2011-01-07T23:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	empathy with google talk have video
2011-01-08T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	have you added accounts to Empathy?
2011-01-08T00:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	empathy needs to be running in order for the memenu to do anything - you do have it running?
2011-01-08T00:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	hold ALT then you can click and drag windows around (on small screens)
2011-01-08T00:37:00.000Z	glaceman	ZykoticK9	im at the top most of my screen
2011-01-08T00:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	so drag the window up - using ALT
2011-01-08T00:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	so the top of the windows is beyond the top of the screen
2011-01-08T00:39:00.000Z	glaceman	ZykoticK9	emphathy never logs in  :S
2011-01-08T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	? you where using MSN right - sorry i don't use MS stuff.  Good luck.
2011-01-08T00:42:00.000Z	glaceman	ZykoticK9	i have sound only on my headphones, can't get it to work on my internal speakers :S
2011-01-08T00:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	sorry man - i'm not good with audio issues...

2011-01-08T14:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	you might want to check out Clonezilla a livecd that does hard drive cloning - similar to Ghost
2011-01-08T14:24:00.000Z	glaceman	ZykoticK9	does clone zilla also backup the bootloader (grub) in case i totally installed a new hard disk ?
2011-01-08T14:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	yes I believe that is an option (but consult the documentation to verify)
2011-02-02T21:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	glaceman	not here please
2011-02-02T21:48:00.000Z	glaceman	ZykoticK9	pm;)
