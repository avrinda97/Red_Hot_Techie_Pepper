2006-08-21T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	depends on what format the audio is.  but yeah, most audio players should

2006-08-21T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	I have no idea.  Usually they just mount as USB drives though, so yeah.  but, I dont know, google for the specific models youre wondering about
2006-08-25T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	what do you need help with?
2006-08-25T10:37:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	I had it working earlier. I need to mount Hdb preferably to /hd2 (but i can mount it anywhere)
2006-08-25T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	hdb is a drive, which partition do you want to mount?
2006-08-25T10:38:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	Its one big drive.
2006-08-25T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	so, hdb1
2006-08-25T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	drive != partition
2006-08-25T10:39:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	No extra partitions
2006-08-25T10:40:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	?
2006-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	yes, lots of us know that.  I'm doing it curently.
2006-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	through a lib like caca or aa, pipe the output (usually -vo) through them
2006-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	yes, it'll use ASCII art
2006-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	yes
2006-09-25T06:03:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	How?
2006-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	same was as normal.  for instance: 'mplayer [path]  -vo caca' if you'veinstalled lib-caca
2006-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	no, you're already connected through ssh when you do it.
2006-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	or you can ssh [mplayer etc]  to do it in one command
2006-09-25T06:05:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	Is lib-coco in the repositories?
2006-09-25T06:05:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	Or whatever it was called.
2006-09-25T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	jman8888	caca-utils will do it
2006-09-25T06:17:00.000Z	jman8888	Flannel	Text Video is awesome
