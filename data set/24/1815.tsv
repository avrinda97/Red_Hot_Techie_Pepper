2009-11-08T20:42:00.000Z	evon		Please help me with this error when I open synaptic http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d7c1b2fdd
2009-11-08T20:44:00.000Z	Mka	evon	which distribution are you using?
2009-11-08T20:50:00.000Z	evon	Mka	9.04
2009-11-08T20:53:00.000Z	Mka	evon	did you launch synaptic like "sudo synaptic"
2009-11-08T20:54:00.000Z	evon	Mka	i opened it from the menu.
2009-11-08T20:54:00.000Z	Mka	evon	ok
2009-11-08T20:57:00.000Z	Mka	evon	try commenting out any entry in /etc/apt/sources.list (and sources.list.d files if any) and do "sudo apt-get update"
2009-11-08T20:57:00.000Z	Mka	evon	after that you can try to re-launch synaptic
2009-11-08T20:58:00.000Z	Mka	evon	I see the linuxmint line and you say you are running ubuntu 9.04
2009-11-08T20:59:00.000Z	evon	Mka	no i was just saying that I get the same error on my laptop that is runnning jaunty and not mint
2009-11-08T21:00:00.000Z	Mka	evon	so you are running mint?
2009-11-08T21:00:00.000Z	evon	Mka	so comment ANY line?
2009-11-08T21:01:00.000Z	Mka	evon	yes, try putting a # on each line
2009-11-08T21:01:00.000Z	evon	Mka	so you mean every line or just 1 line
2009-11-08T21:02:00.000Z	Mka	evon	if you open the file with VIM, you can do this ":1,$ s/^/#/"
2009-11-08T21:02:00.000Z	Mka	evon	every line
2009-11-08T21:02:00.000Z	evon	Mka	ok i just wanted that clarified. I suck wit VIM i have it open in gedit now.
2009-11-08T21:04:00.000Z	Mka	evon	are you winning?
2009-11-08T21:05:00.000Z	evon	Mka	got this error now http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d3b01c673
2009-11-08T21:09:00.000Z	Mka	evon	I've never encountered this type of a problem. have you checked this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=332671 ?
2009-11-08T21:10:00.000Z	evon	Mka	someone just helped me fix it. I removed all the files in /var/lib/apt/lists/ and ran update and it worked.
2009-11-08T21:11:00.000Z	Mka	evon	wow, I suspected that but was hesitating it would work
2009-11-08T21:13:00.000Z	evon	Mka	i didn't actually delete the files. I just moved them to a different directory just in case. thank you for your help though.
2009-11-08T21:13:00.000Z	Mka	evon	thanks for feedback on how you solved it
