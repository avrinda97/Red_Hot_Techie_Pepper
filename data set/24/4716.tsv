2011-12-17T05:35:00.000Z	bobdobbs		Every time I run that, firefox gets downloaded but not installed. And I get the same errors
2011-12-17T05:37:00.000Z	bobdobbs		I'm searching for a deb package for an x86 version of firefox 8, but I can't find one.
2011-12-17T05:38:00.000Z	bobdobbs		I think if I could get that, it would save me from having to fix the broken package manager
2011-12-17T05:38:00.000Z	bobdobbs		yeah, I've added the ppa.
2011-12-17T05:38:00.000Z	bobdobbs		But I apt still won't install the latest firefox
2011-12-17T05:39:00.000Z	gogeta	bobdobbs	sudo apt-get update
