2004-11-04T11:29:00.000Z	GotD0t		WW how are you setting up your printer?
2004-11-04T11:31:00.000Z	GotD0t		WW; because i tried samba and i got the drivers and such installed, and its telling me a command or something was missing
2004-11-04T11:33:00.000Z	GotD0t		codecs
2004-11-04T11:33:00.000Z	GotD0t		haha
2004-11-04T11:33:00.000Z	GotD0t		what format is the avi in?
2004-11-04T11:33:00.000Z	srbaker_	GotD0t	dunno.  but i watched it find on the other ubunto box.   and i don't think i installed anything special
2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	srbaker_		where do i configure xine for sound?
2004-11-04T11:34:00.000Z	GotD0t		ww: well thats because when two windows boxes share a printer the remote box pulls the driver files from the host
2004-11-04T11:35:00.000Z	GotD0t		ww: and when it cant find them on the host, you have to install them yourself
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker_		how do i figure out what format the avi is in?
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	GotD0t	srbaker_	ask the person you got it from
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker_	GotD0t	no.
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	GotD0t	srbaker_	of course im assuming you got it from a P2P network
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker_		yes
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker_		i think it's an audio error, actually
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	srbaker_		how do i make sure xine can talk to my audio device?
2004-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	GotD0t	srbaker_	what makes you think that
2004-11-04T11:37:00.000Z	srbaker_		The Sopranos - Season 5 - Ep 2.avi: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 640 x 368, 23.98 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	GotD0t		right, XviD and mp3
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	srbaker_		** (totem:9835): WARNING **: don't know how to handle audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)48000, channels=(int)2, codec_data=(buffer)020080bb0000ec3e0000800400000c00010002000000820101000000
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	srbaker_		that's why i think it's an audio pro blem
2004-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	GotD0t		gotcha
2004-11-04T11:39:00.000Z	GotD0t	srbaker_	well you need to install the mp3 codec... im surprised you dont have that and you have the XviD
2004-11-04T11:39:00.000Z	srbaker_	GotD0t	but i'm telling you, it works on my other ubuntu box
