2008-04-18T01:21:00.000Z	arvind_khadri		:)) does that mean its very safe
2008-04-18T01:22:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	Windows on vmware is safe, but you will need to make some management for network
2008-04-18T01:23:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	is it advisible to have a AV on it
2008-04-18T01:25:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	jus want to run yahoo messenger on it
2008-04-18T01:26:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	 i have Mc Afee with me thogh
2008-04-18T01:28:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	I would suggest you to use pidgin to use your jahoo account.
2008-04-18T01:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	so better to have a piece of this windows on a drive ;)
2008-04-18T01:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	i use that but cant connect the cam
2008-04-18T01:30:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	ahha, so you want to use windows to use peripherials with windows. Well I have a bad news for you.
2008-04-18T01:30:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	whats that :(
2008-04-18T01:30:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	windows will only see the peripherials what your linux box sees.
2008-04-18T01:31:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	so if you cant make your cam work on linux, vmware will not propagate it to windows.
2008-04-18T01:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	thats why am dropping off VMware
2008-04-18T01:32:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	??? and what will you use then? dual boot system?
2008-04-18T01:32:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	ya thats what am using now....am using the dual boot only for yahoo messenger...
2008-04-18T01:33:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	Well, I think that's all then. Make your cam work under linux, then think on stepping forward.
2008-04-18T01:34:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	it works in linux
2008-04-18T01:48:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	Well, I think that's all then. Make your cam work under linux, then think on stepping forward.
2008-04-18T01:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	kobor42	hmm i would like to wait till a .deb comes for a nice version of yahoo messenger
2008-04-18T01:49:00.000Z	kobor42	arvind_khadri	Sorry, reposted an older comment
