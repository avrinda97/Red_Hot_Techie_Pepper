2007-10-02T09:29:00.000Z	Lindar		fdisk -l brings up the partition table for that drive.
2007-10-02T09:29:00.000Z	Lindar		fsck -y doesn't do anything.
2007-10-02T09:30:00.000Z	Lindar		oui
2007-10-02T09:30:00.000Z	Lindar		I will try once again.
2007-10-02T09:30:00.000Z	Lindar		The superblock cannot be read or does not describe something something blah blah blah....
2007-10-02T09:31:00.000Z	Lindar		I'm not on the same computer.
2007-10-02T09:32:00.000Z	Lindar		I'm on one comp and running to the broken one to run the commands.
2007-10-02T09:33:00.000Z	Lindar		The broken machine can't be networked right now.
2007-10-02T09:33:00.000Z	Lindar		I can't boot. GRUB gives error 24 or 25.
2007-10-02T09:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	what partition is it? first one on the second drive?
2007-10-02T09:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	sudo fsck -f -b 16385 /dev/hdb2
2007-10-02T09:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	that'll use one of the backup superblocks so it can read the partition correctly
2007-10-02T09:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	run the command i gave
2007-10-02T09:37:00.000Z	Lindar	Amaranth	It didn't work.
2007-10-02T09:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	What did it say?
2007-10-02T09:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	ok, listen to usr13 then :)
2007-10-02T09:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	if it can't even read the backup superblock you have something bigger wrong
2007-10-02T09:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	The only way I know of to recover data from a dead HD is to send it somewhere
2007-10-02T09:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	Very expensive
2007-10-02T09:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	What does that have to do with anything?
2007-10-02T09:44:00.000Z	Lindar	Amaranth	I'm dumb and female. I know nothing about this stuff, I just wanted to try it out so I know how it works.
2007-10-02T09:49:00.000Z	Lindar	Amaranth	My mobo maxes at 40-43c, my cpu runs at about 50c.
2007-10-02T09:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	Right but that's idle/running temp, not max temp
2007-10-02T09:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lindar	I would not keep using that HD
