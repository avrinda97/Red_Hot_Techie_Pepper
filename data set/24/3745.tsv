2007-10-23T20:24:00.000Z	aptanet		I've just installed Gutsy as a dual boot on a machine and all went without a hitch until the reboot
2007-10-23T20:24:00.000Z	aptanet		then it gets past grub and brings up the Ubuntu image with the progress bar and stalls
2007-10-23T20:24:00.000Z	aptanet		after a while it drops into a busybox shell - anyone got any ideas?
2007-10-23T20:24:00.000Z	aptanet		I suspect it is to do with the fact that my HD is hanging of a PCI card and not the motherboard, but the first stage didn't complain
2007-10-23T20:24:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	sure you arent booting from cd?
2007-10-23T20:26:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	yes, I've removed the CD and changed the BIOS setting to default to the card
2007-10-23T20:27:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	i had the same when booting from cd because i only have sata drives in my computer. adding all_generic_ide to the boot options did the trick
2007-10-23T20:28:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	I'll take a look - I'm not fully familiar with grub yet, so not so sure about the boot options - need to read up a bit more :)
2007-10-23T20:29:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	thats easy. there should be help at the bottom. 'e' for edit then adding all_generic_ide to the first line, then 'b' for boot... as far as i remember
2007-10-23T20:30:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	do you have only sata drives too?
2007-10-23T20:32:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	no, I have PATA drives on a PCI card because the motherboard doesn't support bigger than the 137G drives - they are also the faster bus speed
2007-10-23T20:33:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	mabye thats the same issue
2007-10-23T20:36:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	must be along the same lines, but my first attempt at the all_generic_ide hasn't worked
2007-10-23T20:37:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	damn. then grab a copy of dmesg output and nopaste it... maybe there is something useful
2007-10-23T20:39:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	haven't got near dmesg yet!
2007-10-23T20:39:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	the root line looks wrong though, (hd0,1) when I know the card usually shows up as a scsi card
2007-10-23T20:39:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	not possible in that shell? ok thats not good
2007-10-23T20:40:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	the only shell I've got near so far is the busybox one, and there's no /var/log there - still at the ramdisk stage!
2007-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	you could try to boot from a live cd and reconfiguring grub
2007-10-23T20:43:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	that's where I'm heading next - changing (hd0.1) to (sd0,1) didn't work - it was just a guess though!
2007-10-23T20:44:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	i meant let grub automatically generate a fresh bootconfig
2007-10-23T20:46:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	from the live CD you mean? My sd0 bit was just a shot in the dark while I had a editable boot in front of me!
2007-10-23T20:48:00.000Z	Alp`	aptanet	yes i mean from the live cd. something like this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351
2007-10-23T20:51:00.000Z	aptanet	Alp`	thanks, that's what I'm working on now - just need to edit the boot options in the bios!
