2010-10-19T23:28:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	try installing python-dev or some package called like that
2010-10-19T23:29:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	I don't think so, does th package you installed provide the file Python.h?
2010-10-19T23:32:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	I know the program, but it obivously needs some headers, not the python interpreter
2010-10-19T23:35:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	have you installed pyhton-dev?
2010-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	find / -name Python.h
2010-10-19T23:38:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	then you haven't installed python-dev, use sudo apt-get install python-dev to do so
2010-10-19T23:38:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	what  wouldn't accept  -h?
2010-10-19T23:39:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	use : instead of >, cause then I can see what you say
2010-10-19T23:40:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	go ahead
2010-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	why would you like to use python 3 instead of python 2.6?
2010-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	I said find / -name Python.h
2010-10-19T23:43:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	afaik pyrit doesn't need the newest python
2010-10-19T23:43:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	anyway, you should've installed python, not just download and untar it
2010-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	okay, that looks a lot better
2010-10-19T23:45:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	somehow gcc doesn't find the installed headers, sounds stupid to me
2010-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	no
2010-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	try to cp the .h to the pyrit directory
2010-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	copy
2010-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	cp is the command :)
2010-10-19T23:52:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	sure
2010-10-19T23:57:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	so what's up?
2010-10-20T00:04:00.000Z	domi007	Licuadora	can't see any error messages in that log
