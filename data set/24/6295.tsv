2005-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	SpAwN		when i try to play a mp3 with xmms it says :Please check that the sound card is configured, that the output plugin is selected, and no other probgram is blocking thesoundcard
2005-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	go to the preferences of xmms and configure other alsa devices...
2005-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	do you hear the ubuntu start sound ?
2005-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	thats bad...
2005-12-06T12:58:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	what is your sound card ? can you see it in "lspci" ?
2005-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	well, atleast its regonized... have you searched ubuntuforums.org or wiki.ubuntu.com
2005-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	intel sound
2005-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	SpAwN	oskude	thanks bro
2005-12-06T13:02:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	but i think the problems is only to know the right module and just loading it
2005-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	in best case :)
2005-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	btw
2005-12-06T13:03:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	do you have any cards in System > Preferences > Sound ?
2005-12-06T13:04:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	then try if you hear the sounds in "sound events" tab
2005-12-06T13:05:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	and ofcourse look that the faders are not down/muted in volume control
2005-12-06T13:06:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	do you have ONLY the intel card in Sound preferences ?
2005-12-06T13:06:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	ok, hmmm
2005-12-06T13:07:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	sry that i cant really help (that was why i changed from debian to ubuntu, my sound was autoconfigured :)
2005-12-06T13:14:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	you should search the ubuntuforums.org. ive seen so many audio not working threads, that there must be a solution :)
2005-12-06T13:16:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	audio is mystery to me too in linux :)
2005-12-06T13:42:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	did that adding you to the audio group help ?
2005-12-06T13:44:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	? does your audio work ?
2005-12-06T13:45:00.000Z	SpAwN	oskude	not yet
2005-12-06T13:47:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	do you have any "snd*" modules loaded (lsmod) ?
2005-12-06T13:58:00.000Z	oskude	SpAwN	when compiling stuff, you need to read the readme/install files and install all (*-dev) packages of the stuff that are written as "required/depends" in there
