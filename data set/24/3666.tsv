2007-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	tigran		Hey. How would I mount a fat32 partition with read/write manually?
2007-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	man mount. Look for filesystem type vfat.
2007-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	I have it mounted. I just can't write to it.
2007-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	/dev/sda4 /media/Music vfat user,auto 0 0   Thats how it is. But I cannot write to it.
2007-11-22T06:02:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	That looks fine. Try unmount it and mount it again. Its possible it failed fsck in the bootup sequence and remounted read-only.
2007-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	sudo mount -a  okay?
2007-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	umount /dev/sda4. Then run mount -a. Shouldn't need sudo as you have it set to user.
2007-11-22T06:05:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	It says I need to be root to unmount it...
2007-11-22T06:05:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	Then sudo umount /dev/sda4.
2007-11-22T06:06:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	Still can't write to it.
2007-11-22T06:06:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	fsck it
2007-11-22T06:07:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	fsck /dev/sda ?
2007-11-22T06:07:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	sda4*
2007-11-22T06:07:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	yes
2007-11-22T06:09:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	Still can't write :S
2007-11-22T06:09:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	What error message does it give you?
2007-11-22T06:09:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	When trying to write to it?
2007-11-22T06:10:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	Yes. You're just saying it doesn't work, without giving details.
2007-11-22T06:10:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	Error while copying to "/media/Music". You do not have permissions to write to this folder.
2007-11-22T06:11:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	The fsck did work. No errors. But I still cant write to it.
2007-11-22T06:11:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	Okay, well that's different. sudo umount /dev/sda4. mount /dev/sda4 (as you, not root!)
2007-11-22T06:13:00.000Z	tigran	bradv	I still can't. Same thing
2007-11-22T06:16:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	Try adding the option umask=666 to the fstab. And make sure you are not mounting it as root.
2007-11-22T06:21:00.000Z	bradv	tigran	There are some pretty good manuals for this sort of thing. Try google your problem and read through what you find.
