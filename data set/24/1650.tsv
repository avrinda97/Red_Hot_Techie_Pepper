2009-10-20T16:03:00.000Z	GIR7590		I think I found my problem, looks like there isn't just a universal repo for all versions of Ubuntu, I am currently using Hardy Heron, and it isn't updating SDL to the extent that is needed by the source I am trying to compile, does anyone know if (If possible) I could update my repos so they use a newer version of Ubuntu's repos?
2009-10-20T16:03:00.000Z	GIR7590		I would upgrade, but I really don't feel like partitioning, or restarting from scratch on this system...
2009-10-20T16:05:00.000Z	GIR7590		Any ideas anyone? :\
2009-10-20T16:06:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	what are you trying to build? and you can always do a dist-upgrade, but I've successfully added newer repositories, installed newer packages (from jaunty into my intrepid install) then disabled the newer repos
2009-10-20T16:06:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	also it seems terribly risky, so i'm not saying "do it" but just that it worked for me ;-)
2009-10-20T16:07:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	hah, i was building that a while ago
2009-10-20T16:07:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	even when it did build for me it got stuck in an infinite loop soon after starting
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	er, that was after i fixed one error in the source code to make it not segfault :-/ lol
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	Sounds like you had fun. :o
2009-10-20T16:09:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	how do you know you need a newer version of SDL? it's been pretty stagnant, SDL 2.0 got permanently put on hold
2009-10-20T16:10:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	http://pastebin.com/d2125aac7
2009-10-20T16:11:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	that's confusing to me, first it says it doesn't have SDL_mixer.h then it says it's too old... forgive me for asking but you *do* have libsdl1.2-mixer-dev installed right? (package name not quite accurate)
2009-10-20T16:12:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	Yes I do.
2009-10-20T16:13:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	I installed them just recently... I guess that's not the problem huh?
2009-10-20T16:13:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	hrm, i wonder how they've decided SDL_mixer is too old... anyways if you're feeling brave you can change your repositories to point to intrepid and update your SDL dev files, and then change your repositories back
2009-10-20T16:14:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	How do you do that? I've played around with the repos a bit before, and I had to fix them the first time around. :o
2009-10-20T16:16:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	basically replace every 'hardy' in /etc/apt/sources.list with 'intrepid' but again it's a bit risky i guess (i dunno, worked for me, but i don't want to say "it'll definitely work")
2009-10-20T16:16:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	Thanks, I'll try that... I'll first back up stuff though. :p
2009-10-20T16:16:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	definitely! good luck...
2009-10-20T16:17:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	also any reason why you don't just upgrade to intrepid altogether?
2009-10-20T16:17:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	it'd probably be less risky
2009-10-20T16:21:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	It worked! Now I have fully functiional intrepid repos... \o/
2009-10-20T16:22:00.000Z	Ademan	GIR7590	nice! good luck
2009-10-20T16:23:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	I now have 728 updates. :p
