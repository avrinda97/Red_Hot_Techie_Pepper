2010-11-25T02:25:00.000Z	thefinn93		can anyone help me with some install trouble?
2010-11-25T02:25:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	What's the trouble?
2010-11-25T02:27:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	It's just frozen.  Are you sure the CD is good?
2010-11-25T02:27:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	The installer should only take about 40 minutes
2010-11-25T02:28:00.000Z	thefinn93	edbian	yes I'm actually using a flash drive and I've wiped it and tried again several times
2010-11-25T02:28:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	I believe that it's trying to open the partitioner at that point.  Run disk check under windows (it will take forever) and try again.
2010-11-25T02:29:00.000Z	thefinn93	edbian	I don't have windoze
2010-11-25T02:29:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	all the hdd's are empty?
2010-11-25T02:29:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	open up gparted.  See what gparted thinks of your partitions, are there errors etc?
2010-11-25T02:30:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	Not having an NTFS partition makes this whole process a lot shorter and easier :D
2010-11-25T02:31:00.000Z	thefinn93	edbian	I don't have anything NTFS. I just opened gparted and it doesn't say anything about errors
2010-11-25T02:31:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	There are no little orange triangles
2010-11-25T02:32:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	If you have all your stuff off then I recommend just wiping all the partitions and leaving it totally empty.  Easiest thing for the installer to read later.
2010-11-25T02:32:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	No that's what I'm saying.  Just make it all "unallocated"
2010-11-25T02:32:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	We'll let the installer format it.
2010-11-25T02:33:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	Yeah, again, just to be sure.  This will erase everything.  Make SURE you have a second copy
2010-11-25T02:33:00.000Z	thefinn93	edbian	yeah I got everything totally backed up before i started this. It says an error occured
2010-11-25T02:33:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	ok
2010-11-25T02:34:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	gparted gave you an error just now?  Or the upgrade to 10.10 gave on error
2010-11-25T02:34:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	online?
2010-11-25T02:34:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	lemme see all the errors.  That will help
2010-11-25T02:35:00.000Z	thefinn93	edbian	alright
2010-11-25T02:37:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	Good call ;)
2010-11-25T02:38:00.000Z	edbian	thefinn93	ProtiK, I concur
