2005-09-25T14:05:00.000Z	Morimando		if yes, then manually edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the mouse device
2005-09-25T14:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the correct way to reconfigure X
2005-09-25T14:07:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	these are all correct ways to reconfigure X
2005-09-25T14:08:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	though your way would anihilate all changes he has possibly made to xorg.conf, so it's only a good way, if the xorg.conf is fresh anyways
2005-09-25T14:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	I'll rephrase that. In Debian - based distros, the canonical method is as I said
2005-09-25T14:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	there's a long explanation at the top of the xorg.conf file
2005-09-25T14:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	you are giving out advice that isn't appropriate for Ubuntu
2005-09-25T14:10:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	why?
2005-09-25T14:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	because there are better ways that have been worked out over years of Debian development
2005-09-25T14:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	you might have noticed by now that several people have said similar things: perhaps there's a reason for that?
2005-09-25T14:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	the distinction is this: more experienced users may use differing methods - new users benefit by being taught the usual/ traitional Debian/Ubuntu methods
2005-09-25T14:17:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	what's enerving about sudo is the total lack of tab completion of the desired command, which i don't think to be very friendly
2005-09-25T14:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	you can change thet by editing /etc/bash.bashrc
2005-09-25T14:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	there's a block there you can uncomment for tab completion
2005-09-25T14:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	you should be happy - wow ! Something you can edit *grin*
2005-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	I'd be more happy if someone told me how to catch and edit/assign the events my Fn key generates
2005-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	hmmm (guess follows)  xev ?
2005-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	nope xev catches the multimedia keys but doesn't react to Fn+something
2005-09-25T14:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	ah well, worth a guess anyway - otherwise I don't know :)
2005-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	i was impressed how much of it Ubuntu setup by default, but now i am stuck. Seems like i first need to built my own kernel and then look closely at ACPI events
2005-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	I would suggest posting a question to the users mailing list
2005-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	I posted it at a German linux forum, the Ubuntu forum and the Gentoo forum, now i need to wait, it seems
2005-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Morimando	I strongly recommend the users mailing list - high traffic and read by some very clueful people
2005-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	Morimando	thoreauputic	I will frequent the mailing list, too, thanks for the tip
