2008-07-10T18:10:00.000Z	DM1		WHY do my Windows network connections NOT work after installing Ubuntu????
2008-07-10T18:11:00.000Z	DM1		Why??
2008-07-10T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	you need to disable WOL as it holds the LAN
2008-07-10T18:12:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	what is WOL?
2008-07-10T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	Wake on LAN
2008-07-10T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	you get a lot of this due to crap drivers and stuff, the card is waiting for wakeup packets to fire up windows so you have to disable it
2008-07-10T18:15:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	how do I disable it?
2008-07-10T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	see the link I pasted namo
2008-07-10T18:19:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	why?
2008-07-10T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	check it
2008-07-10T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	The Windows driver update had disabled "Wake on LAN after shutdown" and the Linux driver couldn't bring the interface up properly. I've now applied the Windows update, enabled the "Wake on LAN after shutdown" feature in Windows device manager and now the card is up and working normally
2008-07-10T18:21:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	sorry... I'm being a bit dense
2008-07-10T18:21:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	how do I enable the wake up?
2008-07-10T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	read the link and jump into windows, you'll need device manager
2008-07-10T18:22:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	but my problem is in Windows, not Ubuntu
2008-07-10T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	so if you boot from ubuntu to windows its locked?
2008-07-10T18:24:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	my connection works great under Ubuntu... under Windows it's whacked... it connects, but no packets get sent or recieved
2008-07-10T18:24:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	it only started yesterday when I installed Ubuntu
2008-07-10T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	its a windows fault then. google for windows socket fixer and run it. should work a treat
2008-07-10T18:25:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	it's obviously related to Ubuntu
2008-07-10T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	doesnt hurt to run it if you got no issues
2008-07-10T18:26:00.000Z	DM1	ActionParsnip	do you think this will work?
2008-07-10T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	for my money, yes
2008-07-10T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DM1	you'll get a red ambulance cross icon wherever you download it. run it and click fix then reboot
