2007-09-24T15:23:00.000Z	wabid		ive been given that link 6 times today
2007-09-24T15:23:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	so you're using fglrx ?
2007-09-24T14:33:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	you could, but not automagically... :-)
2007-09-24T14:36:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	what are you trying to do?
2007-09-24T14:38:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	ati and compiz are always a pita... see if the guys in #ubuntu-effects can help you. MAKE A BACKUP NOW! you never know what's going to break by messing with not officially supoorted Ati-drivers
2007-09-24T15:07:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	first read, then argue :-), ok ?
2007-09-24T15:13:00.000Z	wabid	stefg	still having problems
2007-09-24T15:15:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	that's probably autodetected. So what do want to achieve ?
2007-09-24T15:18:00.000Z	wabid	stefg	when i turn on my laptop it boots to 1920x1440.  once it hits gnome it switches to 1920x1200
2007-09-24T15:18:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	and what is the right reso ?
2007-09-24T15:19:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	what graphics adapter ?
2007-09-24T15:21:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	what driver are you using ?
2007-09-24T15:22:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	i think you need a different one ...
2007-09-24T15:23:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	have you done sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
2007-09-24T15:24:00.000Z	stefg	wabid	then you made a mistake, or the driver is buggy
