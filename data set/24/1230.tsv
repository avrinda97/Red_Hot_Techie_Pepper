2010-05-08T22:54:00.000Z	__-osh-__		I just found out that I can't upgrade my server to "Intrepid" (Yes I know i'm way behind) because my /boot is too small. Disk layout is like this /dev/md0 -> /boot. About 100M. /dev/md1 -> lvm -> / -> About 250GB. Is it possible to shrink lvm and transfer to /boot? I'm assuming this isn't possible to do "on line" but from a rescue disc?
2010-05-08T22:56:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	couple of problems, intrepid is EOL, you'll need to use the old versions server in your apt/sources.list, the other thing you can do is remove old kernels from /boot, ... all this can be done "online" but will require a reboot when done
2010-05-08T22:57:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Yeah, well, I was going for latest LTS but it seems I have to go to Intrepid first?
2010-05-08T22:57:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	what version are you running now?
2010-05-08T22:57:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Hardy I think.
2010-05-08T22:58:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	you should be able to go directly to The latest LTS from there, I don't see why not
2010-05-08T22:58:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	I did this do-upgrade-thing and it seems to go for Intrepid first...
2010-05-08T22:59:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	see this page http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
2010-05-08T23:00:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	do-release-upgrade
2010-05-08T23:00:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Yep, that's the one.
2010-05-08T23:01:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	I'll look at that page now. Still, after deleting all but the running kernel in /boot I'm lacking space in there. :-/
2010-05-08T23:02:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	you'll need to boot with a live disk to resize your /boot partition, cannot be done on a mounted filesystem
2010-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	What I suspected. So it is possible to transfer space from an LVM to a Raid1?
2010-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Setup of this system was done when it wasn't possible to boot from an LVM. Perhaps it's possible now?
2010-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	I believe so, hardware raid controller?
2010-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Unfortunatly I must have done something stupid while choosing size of /boot since it's way to small...
2010-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	No. All done in software raid.
2010-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	how many drives in your array?
2010-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	It's just two drives on this machine. Plain mirroring.
2010-05-08T23:06:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Except for / where I use LVM on top of it.
2010-05-08T23:07:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	Suppose I should download a CD to boot from then. Thanks for your help. Let's see if I can break this system properly... =)
2010-05-08T23:07:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	hmmm, You'll need to disconnect one drive, allow the live disk to repartition it, then re-mirror it back to the backup drive after you test the new config, that way you will have a backup in case things go horribly wrong
2010-05-08T23:08:00.000Z	__-osh-__	GeekSquid	It should be fine just failing one of the drives I think.
2010-05-08T23:10:00.000Z	GeekSquid	__-osh-__	yep, because software raid will be turned off when you mount with the Live Cd, and it will just see the one drive as LVM and /boot on straight raid, good to go
