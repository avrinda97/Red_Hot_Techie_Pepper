2009-04-28T23:12:00.000Z	MadEchidna		Hey you guys I need a tip
2009-04-28T23:12:00.000Z	scunizi	MadEchidna	don't eat peppers
2009-04-28T23:13:00.000Z	MadEchidna		I installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my Mom's Sylvania Netbook G (not Meso) and it won't load GDM all the way, I just get a brown background and mouse cursor and it goes no further
2009-04-28T23:13:00.000Z	MadEchidna	scunizi	lol
2009-04-28T23:13:00.000Z	MadEchidna		Also, I tried killing gdm and running start x, and I got a BLACK screen with a mouse cursor and nothing else
2009-04-28T23:13:00.000Z	MadEchidna		so what's the deal
2009-04-28T23:14:00.000Z	scunizi	MadEchidna	probably a misconfigured video driver..
2009-04-28T23:15:00.000Z	MadEchidna	scunizi	really?
2009-04-28T23:15:00.000Z	MadEchidna		It's a via chrome card
2009-04-28T23:15:00.000Z	MadEchidna		and it worked fine in 8.10
2009-04-28T23:16:00.000Z	scunizi	MadEchidna	it can happen.. if you boot into the recovery kernel there is a fix x option .. that might work

2009-04-28T23:18:00.000Z	MadEchidna		scunizi; I'll give it a shot

2009-04-28T23:24:00.000Z	MadEchidna		CNET says it's a # UniChrome Pro IGP
2009-04-28T23:25:00.000Z	MadEchidna		I don't know what SiS is
2009-04-28T23:25:00.000Z	scunizi	MadEchidna	doesn't look like it is anyway.. which version? any idea? .. lspci might tell you or sudo lshw
