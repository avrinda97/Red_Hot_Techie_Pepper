2005-02-24T17:17:00.000Z	Stormie`		anyone know , where to get usb modem(Aztech) software ?
2005-02-24T17:18:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	do you know if people actually have that modem working with linux?
2005-02-24T17:19:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: i dunno ... just wanna asking ..
2005-02-24T17:20:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	try googling for the modem model and linux
2005-02-24T17:21:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: owh , ok .. but i can detect the modem .. i just needed a software or program to work it
2005-02-24T17:23:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	if you're lucky you have all the drivers you need in the kernel. what you need to find out is which ones to load
2005-02-24T17:24:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: so any solution ... ?
2005-02-24T17:26:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	search the web and you'll find out what modules people are using. or then you'll find it doesn't work for anyone. or you'll find workarounds and hacks to force it to work
2005-02-24T17:27:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: ubuntu has any hacks ?
2005-02-24T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	just kernel modules. but some usb modems are windows only, so you have to convince the modem that's what you have :)
2005-02-24T17:29:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: owh ... ok, going to find out some hard problem going arround
2005-02-24T17:30:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	no, you may find something simple like "load modules foo, bar, and baz and it should work"
2005-02-24T17:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: when i go to device manager, and i found my modem listed there
2005-02-24T17:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: but i can't connect with tat
2005-02-24T17:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: and my modem doesnt have any signal too
2005-02-24T17:33:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	you need to load modules (drivers) for it. then you still need to setup networking to use it for the interface
2005-02-24T17:33:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: just figuring tat , cd had a problem or anything , or i had did anything wrong
2005-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: so where to get the modules ( drivers
2005-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: so where to get the modules ( drivers )
2005-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	not difficult, when you know _which_ modules you need. this you need to find out by searching the web
2005-02-24T17:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	: i will be back later
