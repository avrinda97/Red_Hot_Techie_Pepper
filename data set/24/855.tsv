2011-01-29T03:44:00.000Z	KrashKing		wow, apt-get update/upgrade is nearing 30 mins running
2011-01-29T03:45:00.000Z	KrashKing		ok, question
2011-01-29T03:45:00.000Z	KrashKing		if I have a CDRW of Lubuntu burned, how would I install over 6.06 Ubuntu?
2011-01-29T03:45:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	do you have a separate /home partition?
2011-01-29T03:46:00.000Z	KrashKing		no
2011-01-29T03:46:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	do you want to keep your data? and if so do you have another drive (internal or external?)
2011-01-29T03:46:00.000Z	KrashKing		nothing to save
2011-01-29T03:47:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	ok.. then it's easy.. put the disk in and install.. you'll loose everything though.
2011-01-29T03:47:00.000Z	KrashKing		bah ubottu ;)
2011-01-29T03:48:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	that's why it's recommended to at minimum have a separate partiton for /home.. on reinstall you can do that by using the manual partitioning portion of the install routine.
2011-01-29T03:48:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	not an issue right now
2011-01-29T03:48:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	fresh install
2011-01-29T03:48:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	perfect time to do it.
2011-01-29T03:49:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	should it install from the desktop?
2011-01-29T03:49:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	from the live desktop? sure.. how big is your drive?
2011-01-29T03:49:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	not live desktop
2011-01-29T03:50:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	and it is a 20gb drive
2011-01-29T03:50:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	how do you mean.. an .iso saved on your harddrive?
2011-01-29T03:50:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	no burned it to a cdrw
2011-01-29T03:51:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	oh.. that's fine.. see if the machine will boot to it. If it does follow the prompts.. and with 20gb of HD space I wouldn't worry about a separate partition.
2011-01-29T03:51:00.000Z	KrashKing	izinucs	won't boot from a cdrw, machine too old
2011-01-29T03:52:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	hummmm... got another machine?
2011-01-29T03:52:00.000Z	KrashKing		thanks chazbrown
2011-01-29T03:52:00.000Z	izinucs	KrashKing	there's the answer.. cool chazbrown
