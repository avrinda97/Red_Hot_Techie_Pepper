2008-03-21T06:30:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	 perl -nle 'print /((?:\d{1,3}(?:\.|\b)){4}:1080)/'
2008-03-21T06:31:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	it returns a bunch of blank lines.
2008-03-21T06:32:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	are you trying to match 1.2.3.4:1080  ??
2008-03-21T06:32:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	ahh, right, i see
2008-03-21T06:33:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	 perl -nle 'print /((?:\d{1,3}(?:\.|\b)){4})/, ":whatever"'
2008-04-10T12:11:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	maybe this?  perl -i.bak -pe 'undef $_ unless /\d+|\./'
2008-04-10T12:12:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	that doesn't remove lines that contain both alphabets and numbers and more than one fullstop/period tho
2008-04-10T12:13:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	I noticed, heh.
2008-04-10T12:13:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	if you want to be strict about those conditions. perl -i.bak -pe 'undef $_ unless /^(?:\d+|\.)$/'
2008-04-10T12:14:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	not quite...
2008-04-10T12:14:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	what needs changing?
2008-04-10T12:15:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	I want to keep lines that have only numbers and periods.
2008-04-10T12:16:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	I havent tested that out, but that should keep lines that have numbers and periods, everything else is junked
2008-04-10T12:16:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	no, it junked periods, too.
2008-04-10T12:18:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	perl -i.bak -pe 'undef $_ unless /^[\d+.]$/'
2008-04-10T12:19:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	err, sorry.  perl -i.bak -pe 'undef $_ unless /^[\d.]+$/'
2008-04-10T12:19:00.000Z	unop__	Netham45	:)
2008-04-10T12:25:00.000Z	Netham45	unop__	now I have a bunch of numbers like this, {1,3}.{1,3}.{1,3}.{1,3}<new line>{1,5}<new line>{1,4}            and I need   {1,3}.{1,3}.{1,3}.{1,3}:{1,5}
