2005-07-18T11:35:00.000Z	swarm		is ubuntu hoary using esd by default?
2005-07-18T11:35:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	yes
2005-07-18T11:35:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	and why most multimedia apps doesn't work with it on default conf?
2005-07-18T11:35:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	"most?"
2005-07-18T11:36:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	isn't totem an app defined as a default helper for video and audio in ubuntu hoary?
2005-07-18T11:37:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	anyway apps like totem, gxine, xfmedia crashes gdm while other apps (like xmms) look for different audio driver like alsa or oss. And I'm using default conf got through apt-get.
2005-07-18T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	it works fine here.
2005-07-18T11:37:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	I'm on amd64 using ubuntu hoary for amd64.
2005-07-18T11:38:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	I guess the problem is that and if I'm not the only amd64/ubuntu user it could be a good idea to consider such problems that make ubuntu unusable for fun. Ubuntu anyway is ok for most of work usage patterns I need.
2005-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	no, what you describe is a simple packaging issue. It will go away in Breezy simply due to esd being backburnered.
2005-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	yes it seems like there is a basic conflict that make all such apps crash and make gdm restart. Anyway it makes ubuntu hoary unusable for "fun" on amd64 and yes, I'm waiting for breezy but it's expected in october, not tomorrow. Anyway I've decided to remain in ubuntu and to not switch back to debian sarge on this amd64 machine.
2005-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	does the 32-bit install work any better?
2005-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	yes
2005-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	I would use that
2005-07-18T11:46:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	I'm using cpu intensively and the ratio is 1:5 between 32 and 64 for the apps I use (simulations). So I'm not sure I'll temporarily switch to ubuntu hoary 32 bit.
2005-07-18T11:47:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	simulations? You probably wouldn't want sound crufting in the background anyhow.
2005-07-18T11:49:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	which grid engine are you using?
2005-07-18T11:50:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	globus for production grid
2005-07-18T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	interesting, and what powers your backend?
2005-07-18T11:50:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	what do you mean?
2005-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	what's harvesting the actual cpu cycles?
2005-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	I'm not using production grid, I'm working on algorithms simulation
2005-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	swarm	are you allowing globus to manage it transparently, or are you harnessing another backend?
2005-07-18T11:51:00.000Z	swarm	crimsun	anyway it's mostly about montecarlo simulations afaik
