2009-12-13T17:54:00.000Z	Emanon		not everyone gives a shit about debugging
2009-12-13T17:54:00.000Z	Emanon		sometimes they just want to actually USE a program
2009-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	Emanon		as opposed to using a computer for the sake of using a computer they want to use it for what it IS a tool to accomplish a task
2009-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	Emanon		but im getting off subject
2009-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	Emanon		i heard someone say that once Dr_Willis
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	Emanon		oh and the compulsory "what you talkin bout willis?"
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	Emanon		im going to type this slowly and clearly, not everyone cares HOW their computer does what it does they just want it to do what they want it to do
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	Emanon		they dont care how
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	Emanon		or why
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	Emanon		or how to make it do it better
2009-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	move on please...
2009-12-15T19:18:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	what?
2010-03-13T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	not enabled by default
2010-03-17T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	look at what it does
2010-03-17T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	the scripts is running sudo rm for things outsied a user's home that's managed by apt.  It also calls apt with -y.  And it's just a mess
2010-03-17T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	if someone wants to use the 64bit flash, just copy libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins/, done
2010-03-17T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	you don't have to do most of things that script does
2010-03-17T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	not necessary, but if they want, then use apt to do it
2010-03-17T02:03:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	"works" is not the same as "works safely and correctly"
2010-03-17T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	that's fine, and you can do whatever you want with your system.  But please don't recommend it to others for the reasons I've just mentioned
2010-09-17T00:50:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	su is a command, it works fine by default :/
2010-09-17T00:51:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	yeah, but su works fine, you can su someuser
2010-09-17T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	most people that want to use "su" for some reason just don't know about "sudo -i"
2011-03-16T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	Emanon	n and N to cycle through results
