2010-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	obscurant1st		why x64 for ubuntu desktop is not recomended for daily use? is there any spl reason?
2010-06-28T14:02:00.000Z	obscurant1st		somebody pls tell me?
2010-06-28T14:03:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	because the people who wrote the new website text don't know what they're on about
2010-06-28T14:03:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	"this text is wrong and needs changing", basically
2010-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	so its better if i stick with the 32 bit version?
2010-06-28T14:04:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	if you know which your machine supports, feel free to use whichever. contrary to that wrong text, there's no real difference.
2010-06-28T14:05:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	my machine is x64, but till nw i was using x32 without problems, so i thought of using x64 for a while.
2010-06-28T14:07:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	i hv that x64 server dvd, is there any problem if i install it?
2010-06-28T14:12:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	because AMD invented it. It works fine in Intel x86_64 processors
2010-06-28T14:12:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	oh, ok. thx
2010-07-12T16:49:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	cp /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 /path/to/destination
2010-07-12T16:50:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	bullgard4 thx. :) i ddint knew that!
2011-01-15T12:21:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	because it doesn't use Ubuntu's repositories and makes changes that we don't support. Same reason Ubuntu is not a supported derivative in #debian.
2011-01-15T12:22:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	oh isee. but i think ubuntu people should include some more applications like vlc in their dvd version
2011-01-15T12:22:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	oh, ok. =|
2011-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	yes
2011-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	 thanks!
2011-01-15T12:46:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	however, the exit node can see what the receiving server can see
2011-01-15T12:47:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	so you should use an encrypted protocol anyway.
2011-01-15T12:47:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	so login into blogs i mean wordpress blog which dont use https, is not secure if i use tor?
2011-01-15T12:48:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	correct
2011-01-15T12:48:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	ok, thanks
2011-01-15T12:48:00.000Z	rww	obscurant1st	TOR connections go like this: you -> (tor node -> tor node -> ... -> tor node) -> tor exit node -> server. TOR itself stops people within the (brackets) from seeing what you're communicating.
2011-01-15T12:49:00.000Z	obscurant1st	rww	ok! :D
