2012-07-28T07:36:00.000Z	MCl0vin		why i am having suck bad luck with 12.04
2012-07-28T07:38:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	earlier u said that u have two headphone connectors? did u try both?
2012-07-28T07:41:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	yes, and i also tried with the option of booting while headphone still plugged in, and that didn't fix it
2012-07-28T07:43:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	do have a hdmi output? this would explain the second sound chip
2012-07-28T07:43:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	yes i do
2012-07-28T07:44:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	ok ... did u check basic sound settings ... in a terminal: 'alsamixer'
2012-07-28T07:44:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	or clicking the speaker in unity panel and then 'Sound Settings'
2012-07-28T07:45:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	not using unity , but yes i did both
2012-07-28T07:47:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	did u switch between the outputs there? in alsamixer F6 lets u choose a sound card, sometimes more reliable than the gui dialog
2012-07-28T07:52:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	i also keep getting crash report every time i reboot http://imagebin.org/222380
2012-07-28T07:54:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	that's from the installer of the restricted hw drivers
2012-07-28T07:55:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	but i really can live with the crash report , i just need my headphone to work in a sense when i plug them , it will mute the regular laptop speakers
2012-07-28T07:57:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	pls look at the page i linked .. i'm pretty sure this will help you
2012-07-28T07:58:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	which one i missed it , i might have been out doing my reboot. resend please , also check this out http://imagebin.org/222381
2012-07-28T07:59:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	no matter which i select , still i don't see "headphone' in the connector list box
2012-07-28T07:59:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	that's what i meant ... select the internal audio there
2012-07-28T08:01:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	send me the link please

2012-07-28T08:02:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	^^
2012-07-28T08:06:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	first: update the system, if not already done; if you dont need it - disable bluetooth and if too many of these crash reports come up
2012-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	you can disable them in 'System Settings' -> 'Privacy' ->'Diagnostics'
2012-07-28T08:16:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	jockey sometimes sucks. just in case it got stuck installing your drivers: you can reinstall them with: sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current
2012-07-28T08:17:00.000Z	romy420	MCl0vin	if that produces an error then leave out --reinstall
2012-07-28T08:40:00.000Z	MCl0vin	romy420	still no luck
