2008-11-12T00:28:00.000Z	JohnC-	jimv2000	sorrym its not there,
2008-11-12T00:28:00.000Z	jimv2000		@JohnC I must have installed it...hold on
2008-11-12T00:28:00.000Z	jimv2000		@JohnC: sudo apt-get install startupmanager
2008-11-12T00:29:00.000Z	jimv2000	DelGurth	 If it's causing problems, you can remove Avahi...it's kind of like Rendvous for Mac.
2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	JohnC-	jimv2000	currently i'm on a public cyber cafe. anyway i'll google it. Thanks.
2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	jimv2000		@JohnC you can't use apt-get at a cybercafe?
2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	JohnC-		windows
2008-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	jimv2000		O
2008-11-12T00:32:00.000Z	jimv2000	DelGurth	I suppose you could take mdns out of the resolv.conf file
2008-11-12T00:32:00.000Z	jimv2000		oh
2008-11-12T00:32:00.000Z	jimv2000		I didn't see your second message
2008-11-12T00:32:00.000Z	jimv2000		yeah, wrong file
2008-11-12T00:33:00.000Z	jimv2000	DelGurth	looks like something that should be changed
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		"if you have avahi (aka zeroconf) installed, *.local
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		addresses are resolved via mDNS first. The default config of avahi is to
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		fail if mDNS is enabled and the host is not found in mDNS. This means
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		that you cannot resolve addresses under .local which are
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		in DNS but not mDNS."
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000	DelGurth	I don't know
2008-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	jimv2000		it probably shouldn't be
2008-11-12T00:35:00.000Z	jimv2000		DNS and DHCP seem like they would be just fine for ipv6
2008-11-12T00:36:00.000Z	JohnC-	jimv2000	is this like correct, http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/all/startupmanager/download
