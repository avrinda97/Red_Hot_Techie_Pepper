2006-04-05T16:54:00.000Z	nickrud		Ven] n^, you mean, boot into a console terminal?
2006-04-05T16:55:00.000Z	nickrud		Ven] n^, sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop, and rename /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm to K13gdm
2006-04-05T16:56:00.000Z	nickrud		Ven] n^, I know it seems weird, but when you get a handle on how ubuntu handles services startup, it'll make perfect sense :)

2006-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	thanks a lot :)
2008-02-08T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	I'm using the 4311 with the bcm43xx driver in the kernel
2008-02-08T06:18:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	is it 2.6.24 with native patch to make it work or is it through ndis?
2008-02-08T06:18:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	standard ubuntu provided generic kernel. I ran bcm43xx-fwcutter and all was good.
2008-02-08T06:22:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	i wonder whether ubuntu 8 will rely on 2.6.24 or 2.6.25, since 2.6.25 will have native support

2008-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	I'm not using the b43, but the bcm43xx . Older true but it works here
2008-02-08T06:26:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	seems like the only reasonable way without breaking the update process
2008-02-08T06:27:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	have you been here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2008-02-08T06:27:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	yeah
2008-02-08T06:28:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	don't know what to say then. It worked for my 4311 just fine
2008-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	do you have 4311 rev 01?
2008-02-08T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	bcm94311mgc
2008-02-08T06:33:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	 which revision?
2008-02-08T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	not listed in lspci, I'll take a look at lshw
2008-02-08T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	doh, rev 1
2008-02-08T06:34:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	so it seems we just need to install 2.6.24 to gain native support
2008-02-08T06:34:00.000Z	nickrud	_Marek_	I'm fine with using a blob for now, to maintain kernel compatiblitiy
2008-02-08T06:35:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	i wonder if there is any way to install 2.6.24 from source while preserving most settings from default gutsy 2.6.22 and then have it thrown out if a newer kernel arrives
2008-02-08T06:36:00.000Z	_Marek_	nickrud	thanks :)
