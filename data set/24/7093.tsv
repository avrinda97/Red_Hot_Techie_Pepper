2005-04-25T08:14:00.000Z	mkhan		can anybody help me
2005-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	check your clock
2005-04-25T08:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	if that is wrong, that error will come up
2005-04-25T08:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	it might be other things, but that is probably the most likely
2005-04-25T08:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	do you dual boot
2005-04-25T08:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	windows might be messing with your time
2005-04-25T08:18:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	sync it with ntp
2005-04-25T08:18:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	this may not be the issue, but whenever I ran into it it was due to time
2005-04-25T08:18:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	right click on the clock
2005-04-25T08:19:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	choose adjust date and time
2005-04-25T08:19:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	check "sync with internet servers"
2005-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	mkhan	Burgundavia	i tried to sync my time with ntp but it asked me to install it
2005-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	you should install it
2005-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	ok, now it should work
2005-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	there is a wierd bug associated with that
2005-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	mkhan	Burgundavia	is there a way to get around that bug
2005-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	hmm, no idea
2005-04-25T08:27:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	I think may just be a reporting bug. I suspect that it has enabled NTP, it just needs a reboot to tell it that
2005-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	I also see the error
2005-04-25T08:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	I would try a reboot
2005-04-25T08:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	mkhan	it plays with the system clock
