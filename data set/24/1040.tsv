2010-08-25T22:44:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	sadly testdisk finds more than fits in the table - I am not really making sence of it's deep-scanned table. the first run sadly only offered 2 partitions... not enough =P

2010-08-25T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	(and two partitions is still two more than you had before :-)
2010-08-25T22:47:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	omfg - niiiiice - still have the output of the original fdisk in the terminal backlog...

2010-08-25T22:53:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	no install media @ hand... and bad experience with usb-boot
2010-08-25T22:55:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	well, burnable CDs are cheap
2010-08-25T22:55:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	you're running on the live system now?
2010-08-25T22:56:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	no cd drive - netbook - and no - the system is still live since the accident =P
2010-08-25T22:57:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	just make sure you get the cylinder numbers correct, and double-check before committing the table
2010-08-25T22:57:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	should be fine
2010-08-25T23:11:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	oh deef - going by cylinders - but the Blocks are different =/
2010-08-25T23:11:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	dear, actually. how different are the block counts?
2010-08-25T23:15:00.000Z	fonziefrenzie	sipior	...
2010-08-25T23:18:00.000Z	sipior	fonziefrenzie	sorry, that partition message was for you, not kennydude :-)
