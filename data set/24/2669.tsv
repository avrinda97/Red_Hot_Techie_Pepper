2008-09-26T09:00:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Does command:    apt-cache policy sed                 show that it is installed? (*** beside one of the versions)
2008-09-26T09:00:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	i am using wubi and have no clue what that apt-cache means i am new to ubuntu just installed wubi about 20 minutes ago
2008-09-26T09:02:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Open application called Terminal   and type in the command. It will list available versions of the program called "sed" and show 3 asterisks beside one of those if it is installed. If not installed, no 3 asterisks
2008-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	The most likely thing is that the program "sed" is not yet installed on your system
2008-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	i press enter to load ubuntu from the bootloader and it goes to a screen where it has the logo and loading bar then, after awhile of it frozen in the quarter mark that shows up about 100 times then the second and third messeges i posted comes up
2008-09-26T09:03:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Ah, so not even booting fully then
2008-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	yes

2008-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	No
2008-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Are you using some raid system on your windows machine?
2008-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	i dont know is there a way to tell
2008-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	is there a way to rell if i am using raid i dont know what raid is
2008-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Probably, but offhand I forgoet most of what I knew about windows
2008-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Raid is when you are storing data across several drives as if they are  single drive. Wubi hates it
2008-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	i only have one harddrive in my computer but i do have a ext harddrive
2008-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	OK, odds are no raid set up then
2008-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	should i unplug that
2008-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Probably not
2008-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	genii	Davidgfhgfh	Was it an external drive you are attempting install onto?
2008-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	Davidgfhgfh	genii	no
