2008-07-01T21:54:00.000Z	dave11		is there a flash plugin for 64 bit ubuntu?
2008-07-01T21:54:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	nope.. but you use the 32-bit pluging using some kind of wrapper
2008-07-01T21:54:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	it should be done for you automatically.
2008-07-01T21:55:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	ok thanks
2008-07-01T21:55:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	yes
2008-07-01T21:56:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	nope.. you can use a 64-bit browser with the wrapper thingy.. or use a 32-bit firefox ..
2008-07-01T21:57:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	they are wrong
2008-07-01T21:58:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	soundrayok thanks ill try that
2008-07-01T22:11:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	run "sudo apt-get update" first
2008-07-01T22:11:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	im runnnig the live cd
2008-07-01T22:11:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	yes.. run "sudo apt-get update"
2008-07-01T22:12:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	ok
2008-07-01T22:12:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	live cd or not.. it's the same
2008-07-01T22:56:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	well thanks for the disinformation..  the update required a restart
2008-07-01T22:59:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	disinformation??
2008-07-01T23:00:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	i couldnt install the update to put flash on because the update required a restart which kills the update on the live cd
2008-07-01T23:01:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	installing flash doesn't require an update.. no way.. never ever
2008-07-01T23:01:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	you might have gotten another update.. ie a kernel update.. those do require a restart
2008-07-01T23:03:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	so its impossibe to put the flash player on the live cd
2008-07-01T23:05:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	no
2008-07-01T23:06:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	how is it not impossible to put the flash player on the live cd if it requires a restart for the new kernel?
2008-07-01T23:08:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	look.. I'm running out of patience here and I don't appreciate being told I spread disinformation when I'm trying to help someone.. ask the channel.. perhaps they can help you
2008-07-01T23:12:00.000Z	dave11	Slart	am i incorrect???
2008-07-01T23:14:00.000Z	Slart	dave11	I'll do this as clearly as I can.. you can use flash while running from a live cd.. even if you have to use apt to install stuff.. even if there are kernel updates waiting for you.. but I don't want to help you with it.. ask someone else..
