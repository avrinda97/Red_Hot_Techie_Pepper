2009-03-27T09:40:00.000Z	crdlb	casinaroyale	can you be more specific?

2009-03-27T09:44:00.000Z	casinaroyale	crdlb	I can get the PacketManipulator installed. The problem is it doesnt install the plugins. So, I am trying to reinstall it.
2009-03-27T09:45:00.000Z	crdlb	casinaroyale	I guess it didn't install properly then, xplaining the missing uninstaller
2009-03-27T09:46:00.000Z	casinaroyale	crdlb	How did you know about the uninstaller?
2009-03-27T09:46:00.000Z	crdlb	casinaroyale	I looked at the setup.py on their source code browsser: http://trac.umitproject.org/browser/trunk/setup.py
2009-03-27T09:52:00.000Z	casinaroyale	crdlb	I am not installing the complete package umit. I am installing only PacketManipulator
2009-03-27T09:52:00.000Z	casinaroyale	crdlb	http://trac.umitproject.org/browser/branch/PacketManipulator
2009-03-27T09:59:00.000Z	crdlb	casinaroyale	no uninstall script for that one, but nearly everything seems to be installed to /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PM/
2009-03-27T10:12:00.000Z	casinaroyale	crdlb	Thank u very much..... I'll look into it
