2007-05-05T12:55:00.000Z	cybe		I have a little problem, and hope someone can help me: I have a 500 GB harddisk wich is formatted in FAT32 at the moment, but i need to have files bigger than 4GB on it. But wich filesystem should i use? People get files from my harddisk often, and they all use Windows, it would be a hard job to make all of them install an ext3 driver... I could install NTFS read/write on my Ubuntu, but that might mess up all the files right? And couldn't
2007-05-05T12:55:00.000Z	cybe		 the ext3 driver do the same ?
2007-05-05T12:56:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	you could put the big drive on a linux pc and share the disk over samba
2007-05-05T12:58:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	yes i know - but the file transfer is only 100mb/s then. But it might be the only solution if not the NTFS writing is reliable yet?
2007-05-05T12:58:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	I did not have any problems with it. but its still not stable. Might get buggered with permissions as well
2007-05-05T12:59:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	100 mb/s isn`t enough?
2007-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	 Were talking big files, and a lot of them... And it would just be easiest if it was directly connected... I might look into NTFS, but i would really hate to loose 500 GB of data
2007-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	I hear that :/
2007-05-05T13:01:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	NTFS Reading is splendid. its the writing that gives the problems
2007-05-05T13:01:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	I know but i will be doing a lot of writing
2007-05-05T13:02:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	I am primarily using the harddisk on my own computer under Ubuntu... And thats where most files are written from. The ext3 driver might me more safe for me, but it would annoy a lot of people
2007-05-05T13:05:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	Just smack your users and make them use linux. But sorry, I dont have any other ideas (except mixing virtual machines and samba shares in them and a lot of weirdness
2007-05-05T13:06:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	well your right! It is not my problem that they can't have access, they should use a good stable system instead of Windows, lol, I am going to format it in ext3 ;)
2007-05-05T13:07:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	^_^ Thats the spirit
2007-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	I just got an idea, could I have 2 partitions on the drive or something, one in FAT32 which contains a setup-file for the ext3 for Windows, and a partition with all the other files in ext3
2007-05-05T13:14:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	you could also put the setup file on the ntfs part. from windows
2007-05-05T13:24:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	what does that command do? Can it also remove directories containing files?
2007-05-05T13:24:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	remove recursivly. so the dir and all in it
2007-05-05T13:25:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	NICE! I have looked for that command for ages :P
2007-05-05T13:25:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	*Bows*
2007-05-05T13:25:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	be very very VEEEERY carefull though
2007-05-05T13:25:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	why ?
2007-05-05T13:26:00.000Z	cybe	omegazepher	and thats why we have to be careful?
2007-05-05T13:26:00.000Z	omegazepher	cybe	usser, well it doesn`t check. it doesn`t ask it just deletes
