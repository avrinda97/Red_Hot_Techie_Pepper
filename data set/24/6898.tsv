2005-07-15T15:59:00.000Z	Ninwa		Although the last time I wasn't even touching the keyboard.
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	Ninwa		Is there a Linux command that I can use to restart services (e.g apache)
2005-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	Ninwa		If you wouldn't mind.
2005-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	Ninwa		I was looking at some sort of paramater for apache itself, like apache restart, but no luck.
2005-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	Ninwa		Oh, okay.
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	Ninwa		joey@ubuntu-t20laptop:/etc/init.d$ sudo apache2 restart
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	Ninwa		Returns the syntax help for apache2
2005-07-15T05:37:00.000Z	Ninwa		apache2ctl worked fine
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	Ninwa		No right, I'm not. apache2 restart, strangely, isn't valid.
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	Ninwa		It's non-issue, apache2ctl worked, but just weird.
2005-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	try 'which apache2' -- probably /usr/bin/apache2 , different to /etc/init.d/apache2
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	Ninwa	HappyFool	That one neither.
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	Ninwa		joey@ubuntu-t20laptop:/usr/bin$ apache2 restart
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	Ninwa		Usage: apache2 [-D name]  [-d directory]  [-f file] 
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	no
2005-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	'apache2' without a path specification is probably /usr/bin/apache2, or mayb sbin/apache2
2005-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	that is not the same thing as the service startup script in /etc/init.d/apache2
2005-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	Ninwa	HappyFool	When I have apache2 and I use tab-completion it just tells me about apache2-ssl-certificate and apache2ctl, it doesn't specify the path.
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	indeed. tab completion will not tell you the path
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	'which' does that
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	Ninwa		Oh! Sorry, I read which literally.
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	Ninwa		I appologize.
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	Ninwa		/usr/sbin
2005-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ninwa	fair enough ;)
