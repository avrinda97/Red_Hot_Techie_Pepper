2012-03-04T13:19:00.000Z	GhostWolf		see what the problem im talking about
2012-03-04T13:19:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	link us up.
2012-03-04T13:23:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	hmm. i have issues, but did you upgrade 11.10 or did you run a fresh install of it?
2012-03-04T13:23:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	fresh install
2012-03-04T13:24:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	ah well that is what i was wondering, i upgraded from 11.04. wonder if it was a bug when upgrading
2012-03-04T13:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	I have noscript running thoughwith twitter and facebook blocked as a gueat it works, facebook is like big script land.
2012-03-04T13:26:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	thanks for saying it works for you and installed a fresh install of 11.10. i might have to do exactly that to test it, just hope my toolbar i use for firefox will work as same as now
2012-03-04T13:26:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	well i don't log in with my facebook login on that tinychat.com i been logging in under guest to test my webcam
2012-03-04T13:27:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	I think your getting to much script probably, install no scipt and block stuff not needd.
2012-03-04T13:28:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	well i use facebook. so i can't do that i play games on facebook, but never had a problem before with the flash player freezing. but im going to try to install a fresh 11.10. if there is a lts already i'll download that and install the lts til the lts of 12.04 comes out
2012-03-04T13:29:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	when I looked at all the script running there is a lot besides the one I mentioned.
2012-03-04T13:29:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	i have no idea about the script stuff sorry i just know i use facebook and can't stop using that as well
2012-03-04T13:30:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	you don't have to it is just code being run at you through flash.
2012-03-04T13:31:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	so you saying i don't have to stop using facebook? to test this theory how do i do this scripting thing? and what stuff does it block exactly?
2012-03-04T13:31:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	and a whole bunch of it, install the FF plugin noscript then click on the icon you will see what I mean
2012-03-04T13:33:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	FF tools-addons type noscript and install you will see a icon, and in the customize, of the toolbar witha right click are two other noscript icons as well.
2012-03-04T13:34:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	takes bit to understand how it works but is a great tool for blocking extra junk.
2012-03-04T13:35:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	when you say extra junk exactly what extra junk you talking about? just want to make sure
2012-03-04T13:38:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	I have all the google blocked always 4 different sets
2012-03-04T13:39:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	ah well i just isntalled the noscript 2.3 or whatever and it still freezes on tinychat.com the flash player setting popup that is
2012-03-04T13:39:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	you can okay it when you want. you can block the facebook and twitter and okay when you want as well, and the fbcdn
2012-03-04T13:40:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	i just tested it, i still gotten the frozen setting as before
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	GhostWolf	cool noscript is kinda hard to just figure out instantly, hope the fresh install works.
2012-03-04T13:43:00.000Z	GhostWolf	Fyodorovna	well i'll let ya know, if it doesn't then well im going to reinstall 11.04 cause i never had a issue with that before
