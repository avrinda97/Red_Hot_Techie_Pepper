2006-03-05T10:51:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu		hei
2006-03-05T10:51:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu		someone here can use the rename command?
2006-03-05T10:51:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu		i have to rename a bunch of mp3 files in wav, since the extension is wrong
2006-03-05T10:51:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	probably lots, what's up?
2006-03-05T10:52:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	something like:  mv *.mp3 *.wav
2006-03-05T10:52:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	rename -n 's/\.mp3$/.wav/' *
2006-03-05T10:52:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	can you explain that to me?
2006-03-05T10:53:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	the -n will make it not actually do anything, just show you what it would do, if it looks ok then just get rid of -n
2006-03-05T10:53:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	man regex :)
2006-03-05T10:53:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	basically it says change all the .mp3 at the end to a .wav
2006-03-05T10:54:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	i have been through regex several times..
2006-03-05T10:54:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	actually rename uses perl regex, so man perlrequick
2006-03-05T10:55:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	i see, but anyway why do you know them so well?
2006-03-05T10:55:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	I read the man pages!
2006-03-05T10:55:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	that's all? and you remember them?
2006-03-05T10:55:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	and I played with them a bit, that is probably the best
2006-03-05T10:55:00.000Z	Tallia1Kubuntu	_jason	i se
2006-03-05T10:57:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	there are probably a few online tutorials that are a little easier to read than the man pages
2006-03-05T10:57:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	do you understand the command now?  which part are you unsure about?
2006-03-05T10:57:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	now the important question: did it work? :)
2006-03-05T10:58:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	which part is complex?
2006-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	I suppose, it's like a new language in a way.  perlrequick and perlretut are the two man pages for perl regex
2006-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	man perl will list all the man pages for a bunch of perl stuff
2006-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	_jason	Tallia1Kubuntu	might help if you mention the package
