2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	int0x		hi, i installed ubuntu and can't update it or do anything to login as the privlaged user like root
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z	int0x		Sorry, user dave may not run sudo on localhost.
2005-04-26T14:30:00.000Z	ups	int0x	you need to use the first user created during the install
2005-04-26T14:31:00.000Z	ups	int0x	why not?
2005-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	ups	int0x	did u change it? the installation puts one user there
2005-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	int0x	ups	no, in the install i made 'root' the privlaged user, and dave the normal user
2005-04-26T14:40:00.000Z	ups	int0x	type su
2005-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	ups	int0x	and see if you can login as root
2005-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	ups	int0x	root password
2005-04-26T14:41:00.000Z	ups	int0x	now edit the sudoers file to add 'dave' to it
2005-04-26T14:42:00.000Z	int0x	ups	what is an easy editing program? im used to nano :P
2005-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	ups	int0x	other apps don't work because u modified the default behaviour, which is to use sudo instead ot root
2005-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	ups	int0x	use visudo for editing the file
2005-04-26T14:45:00.000Z	ups	int0x	ubuntuguide.org
2005-04-26T14:46:00.000Z	ups	int0x	i think not

2005-04-26T15:15:00.000Z	ups	int0x	xmms is a winamp clone, but i like vlc more
