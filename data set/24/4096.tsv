2007-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	I have that GPU, and I spent forever fixiing it, just got it working
2007-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	with that being said
2007-07-15T12:25:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	Is there anything wrong right now?
2007-07-15T12:33:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	Have you tried sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-net (Thats what just made my card start working)
2007-07-15T12:34:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	You could, worst comes to worst, you get thrown to a Shell with no GUI, which is where I was, but you could just reinstall default drivers
2007-07-15T12:35:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	it said "couldnt find package"
2007-07-15T12:36:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	I forgot, first do "sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx"
2007-07-15T12:36:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	it said "package not installed so not removed"
2007-07-15T12:37:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	Okay, thats good, we didn't want it anyway :D Now be sure you type this exactly (without the quotes) "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new"
2007-07-15T12:38:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	its installing now
2007-07-15T12:38:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	oh, ok :D
2007-07-15T12:38:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	downloading and installing now... after that just do a restart and thats it?
2007-07-15T12:38:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	there is another command
2007-07-15T12:38:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	I need to remember it, but don't restart
2007-07-15T12:41:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	ok, done... installed, what now?
2007-07-15T12:42:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	nvidia-xconfig enable
2007-07-15T12:43:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	Yeah, that wasn't the right one
2007-07-15T12:45:00.000Z	un4get	conorkirkpatrick	should i wait for somethin... ?
2007-07-15T12:45:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	sudo nvidia-xconfig
2007-07-15T12:47:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	"sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and choose nvidia as the driver
2007-07-15T12:48:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	"nvidia"
2007-07-15T12:50:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick	un4get	wait for gnomefreak's help :D
