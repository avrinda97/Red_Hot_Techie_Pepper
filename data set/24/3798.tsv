2008-02-27T22:26:00.000Z	danhs		you know what?  I added editor=emacs to .bashrc and that worked
2008-02-27T22:26:00.000Z	danhs		I guess it's limited to bash now if I wanted to change shells.....
2008-02-27T22:26:00.000Z	danhs		.profile doesn't work?
2008-02-27T22:27:00.000Z	wols	danhs	update-alternatives
2008-02-27T22:27:00.000Z	danhs	wols	update-alternatives?
2008-02-27T22:29:00.000Z	wols	danhs	~/.profile or such
2008-02-27T22:32:00.000Z	wols	danhs	novell supposedly works on something. not yet in ubuntu. too new
2008-02-27T22:33:00.000Z	danhs	wols	I'm just using Xming and xdmcp and it's pretty good......
2008-02-27T22:33:00.000Z	wols	danhs	what has your non ubuntu X server to do with ubuntu?
2008-02-27T22:33:00.000Z	danhs	wols	I think NX (from no machine) is a little bit better.....I'd really like it if I could have "full pretty desktop" like NX with VNC; and with no keyboard interrupt problems
2008-02-27T22:34:00.000Z	danhs	wols	X server has nothing to do with it.....my crappy windows laptop connects to powerful ubuntu machine....it's quite nice......you mentioned the Novell thing
2008-02-27T22:34:00.000Z	danhs	wols	Yea, free-NX seems a bit dead....unfortunately
2008-02-27T22:35:00.000Z	wols	danhs	it's non-free software iirc
2008-02-27T22:35:00.000Z	danhs	wols	Best thing about NX or vnc over X window solution is that I can ALT-TAB and other keyboard commands and not have them execute locally, but instead on the remote machine
2008-02-27T22:36:00.000Z	danhs	wols	I found Envy fixed my nvidia driver problems
2008-02-27T22:37:00.000Z	wols	danhs	it broke your ubuntu awfully. please stop talking to me on any future problems your system has. thank you, goodbye
2008-02-27T22:49:00.000Z	danhs	wols	I see what you meant about update-alternatives now.....let me ask you a dumb question though: can I setup the default editor on a  per-user basis?
2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	danhs	wols	It looks like I need to sudo to change update-alternatives config
2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	wols	danhs	no sorry. ~/.profile should do it tho instead of .bashrc
2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	danhs	wols	huh....I *can* use ~/.profile?
2008-02-27T22:50:00.000Z	wols	danhs	why not? your user owns that file
2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	wols	danhs	only executed on real logins tho
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	wols	danhs	yes. apps need to honor EDITOR to work
2008-02-27T22:54:00.000Z	wols	danhs	that is /etc/alternatives
