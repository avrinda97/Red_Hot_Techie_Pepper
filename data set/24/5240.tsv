2008-03-08T23:06:00.000Z	MatBoy		when I have XFCE installed and want to install KDE also, what packages do I need to include in apt-get to get it running at once ?
2008-03-08T23:06:00.000Z	MatBoy		I think I need more than just apt-get install kde
2008-03-08T23:07:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	kde is the vanilla kde, you may want kubuntu-desktop instead
2008-03-08T23:07:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	installing that one right now
2008-03-08T23:12:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	does gnome also has a ubuntu version ?
2008-03-08T23:12:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	yeah, ubuntu-desktop
2008-03-08T23:12:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	ok, better than KDE I guess, I don't dislike KDE, but I took XFCE for speed
2008-06-28T04:09:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	egroupware is in universe, #ubuntu-motu is the place to go.  However, 1.4 is in Intrepid
2008-07-20T05:32:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	Ubuntu doesn't.  Firefox does in its history
2008-07-20T05:33:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	Just do it through firefox.  You can actually set it to clear the private data every time you close it
2008-12-29T03:39:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	I already asked ;)
2008-12-29T03:42:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	To boot successfully on LVM, you need /boot on a separate (non-LVM) partition
2008-12-29T03:42:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	mhh, itś on LVM :( thatś why lilo is installed I think
2008-12-29T03:42:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	That is, with GRUB.  I have no idea with lilos capabilities for LVM/RAID.  But you should move /boot off of your LVM
2008-12-29T03:43:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	that will be a challenge, or shall I mv everything and make a new partition for it ?
2008-12-29T03:44:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	Just create a partition in front of the LVM ones on one disk, and put /boot on it, then move stuff, yeah.  Or re-install, that's likely the least amount of work (for you, anyway, but computers like work)
2008-12-29T03:47:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	grub works using LVM ;)
2008-12-29T05:24:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	I'm reinstalling with a MD with ext3 for /boot only ;)
2008-12-29T05:31:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	I have seen that lilo is used when you place /boot on LVM... but grub works with lvm
2008-12-29T05:32:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	GRUB won't work with /boot on LVM, at least, not without a ramdisk and stuff
2008-12-29T05:32:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	I recently asked #grub and people there use it that way
2008-12-29T05:32:00.000Z	Flannel	MatBoy	That's likely GRUB 2
2008-12-29T05:33:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	maybe
2008-12-29T05:33:00.000Z	MatBoy	Flannel	ah now I have my bootscreen again too ;)
