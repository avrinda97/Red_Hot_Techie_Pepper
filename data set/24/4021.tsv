2007-09-13T13:26:00.000Z	WindsofTime		tico.. you dont understand I am not making a partition to install a new OS
2007-09-13T13:28:00.000Z	WindsofTime		I am just merely resizing my NTFS partition to give it a bit more room being I am running out.. I have 2 partitions.  1 NTFS of 10Gigs for Windows files. and The rest of the harddrive as a Fat32 partition.  I "took a chunk out of" the Fat32 parition giving me 3Gigs of freespace to use.  I unmounted the NTFS so I could resize it.  But when I go to resize it, it doesn't recognize the unformated space.
2007-09-13T13:30:00.000Z	WindsofTime		*yawns*
2007-09-13T13:32:00.000Z	WindsofTime		ask the question not just say "help" :P
2007-09-13T13:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	you want to increase the size of the ntfs partition? Is the new space right next to the ntfs partition?
2007-09-13T13:32:00.000Z	WindsofTime	dystopianray	no
2007-09-13T13:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	a partition cannot be fragmented it must be one block of hdd space
2007-09-13T13:34:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	you can, but it must be directly after the ntfs partition
2007-09-13T13:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	it must be (ntfs)(freespace)(fat32)
2007-09-13T13:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	you need to move the fat32 partition into the free space
2007-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	WindsofTime	dystopianray	what do you mean move it into the 3Gig space?
2007-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	yes
2007-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	you must move the fat32 partition to provide room for the ntfs parittion to grow
2007-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	move the fat32 partition so that there is room for the ntfs partition to grow
2007-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	no, you're only moving it
2007-09-13T13:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	gparted can move a partition
2007-09-13T13:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	just move the current partition to the right
2007-09-13T13:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	I don't think you can resize from the start of the partition, it's not trivial anyway
2007-09-13T13:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	so use gparted
2007-09-13T13:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	I haven't said anything that involves the terminal
2007-09-13T13:41:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	I don't know where the exact buttons are or what they are called, but it should be obvious
2007-09-13T13:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	make a backup
2007-09-13T13:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	you have 3GB of space to move the fat32 partition into
2007-09-13T13:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	WindsofTime	which will make 3GB of free space after the ntfs partition
