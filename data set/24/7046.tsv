2007-02-20T16:21:00.000Z	andre		Does ubuntu support any widget software?
2007-02-20T16:21:00.000Z	andre		!widget
2007-02-20T16:22:00.000Z	andre		!widget
2007-02-20T16:24:00.000Z	Sanne	andre	widget on Linux is usually used to describe buttons and other controls of the user interface. I believe you may want to look for desktop applets.
2007-02-20T16:24:00.000Z	andre		sanne: oh  ok,  thanks for the help,  would you happen to know the answer to my question then?
2007-02-20T16:24:00.000Z	andre		!applet
2007-02-20T16:25:00.000Z	Sanne	andre	I'm not sure for gnome... I bet there are such applets. For kde there's superkaramba, I think (I don't use those myself, so I'm not sure)
