2007-08-22T12:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	I'll have to check on the syntax - just a second
2007-08-22T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	Okay, here we go:  <Directory /private> (or /, etc.), \n Order Allow,Deny \n Allow from localhost,127.0.0.1 \n Deny from all \n </Directory>.  Put that in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (or default000, depending)
2007-08-22T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	Then restart apache, 'sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 restart'
2007-08-22T13:00:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	awesome!   I changed the Listen 80  directive to be Listen 127.0.0.1:80   and did /opt/lampp/lampp restart    seems to be equivalent
2007-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	what kind of specs?
2007-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	nvidia graphics card, dual monitors
2007-10-25T14:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	Gnome is _much_ heavier than IceWM, so that's not a very even comparison.
2007-10-25T14:37:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	heaviness doesn't matter, kde runs fine,  full screen graphical 3d games run fine,   default gutsy install freezes.
2007-10-25T14:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	on any particular thing?  Have you checked for bugs?
2007-10-25T14:38:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	the window manager freezes.  I can spike the cpu if I just drag a window around real fast
2007-10-25T14:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	Ah.  Try disabling desktop effects.  (System > Prefs > Appearance > Far right tab)
2007-10-25T14:39:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	I did that, and removed compiz, and reinstalled metacity.
2007-10-25T14:40:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	if I boot up in the default session and launch a fullscreen 3d graphics game I can play for hours with no problems, but a couple window events and it crashes.   i've had icewm up now for almost 2 hours with no problems.
2007-10-25T14:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	have you searched the bugs and forums for any other reports of issues with your particular card?
2007-10-25T14:41:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	it is not the card if I can play 3d acceleration games for hours and use other window managers...   but anyways it is an nvidia and auto detected and fully supported
2007-10-25T14:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	You don't seem to be listening....  If it were independent of hardware, I would have the same issue.
2007-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	well if it were specific to my hardware, switching window managers wouldn't matter it would still lock up.
2007-10-25T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	only if every window manager accessed the hardware the same way
2007-10-25T14:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	So I'm taking that as a "no", so suggesting you go do that first, so we have a better idea of what the possible issues might be.
2007-10-25T14:43:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	every window manager accesses the nvidia driver the same way.  it is the driver that interacts with the hardware directly, not the wm
2007-10-25T14:43:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	my graphics card is nvidia geforce 8600 gts
2007-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	I did get one error message about window manager events with no timestamp.  i think that is messing up my dual core because the cpu spikes
2007-10-25T14:46:00.000Z	hwilde	tonyyarusso	like if I grab a window to drag and drop and just shake it around real fast, it spikes the cpu, then freezes
2008-12-19T01:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hwilde	that won't remove dependencies that are orphaned
