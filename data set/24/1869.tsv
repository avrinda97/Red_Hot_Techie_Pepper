2009-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	Alvinware		Any one got any good suggestion on Theme?
2009-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	gnome-look.org
2009-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	Any things from that, no?
2009-07-30T21:16:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	depends on what you like
2009-07-30T21:16:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	I mean any other website, beside that?
2009-07-30T21:17:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	only 1 I know of if you are running Gnome
2009-07-30T21:19:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	what do you mean?
2009-07-30T21:20:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	I'm using a 64bits processor, and running a 32bits O.S., 32bits x 2 = 64bits?
2009-07-30T21:20:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	you would need to install the 64bit version
2009-07-30T21:21:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	So i'm going to waste the another 32bits on my processor that i'm not using?
2009-07-30T21:21:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	basically
2009-07-30T21:23:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	I found a big difference in speed when I changed from 32bit to 64 bit
2009-07-30T21:24:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	you mean 64bits more speed? How about the application programs that work in 32bits, will it work in 64bits too, no problem?
2009-07-30T21:25:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	all the apps I use have a 64bit version so not sure on that
2009-08-01T18:20:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	if their card worked without having to install anything doesn't that mean they didn't have to install the propreitary drivers?
2009-08-01T18:21:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	yeah, that's correct, but if only the propreitary driver have it in linux version.
2009-08-01T18:23:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	I thought you had to agree to install propritary drivers before they were installed?
2009-08-01T18:24:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	for me, it automatically look it up for me, and i guess the drivers that installed was quite correct in company name.
2009-08-01T18:25:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	I just did the same thing with an install of Debian, it found my linksys pcmcia wireless card and loaded the driver so I would say those are not proprietary
2009-08-01T18:26:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	but in nvidia website, it got quite a lots for the linux, it's depend on the company.
2009-08-01T18:28:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	Nvidia has pretty good support so it doesn't surprise me that the cards are autodetected
2009-08-01T18:31:00.000Z	Alvinware	Halitech	proprietary or not, look in hardware drivers for each hardware devices, select any of it, bottom display will say the proprietary word in there if it's.
2009-08-09T19:09:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	I'm not aware of any program that can you actual distance (by the foot/meter) but iwlist scan will give you the strength, conky has the ability to give you that as well
2009-08-09T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	Alvinware	ssh is typically used to control a computer
