2007-05-12T10:53:00.000Z	jul1609		now I went to /etc/modules to add a snd_pcm at the end, I thought that was it, but no result. Module is intel8x0, it seems to be installed this time. I was told yeasterday that the kernel was supposed to handle it out of the box, yet nada. Obviously, I've checked the trivia (not mute? right file format?) before doing anything
