2008-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	neohaven		ok guys... I got Ubuntu 7.10, and i'm trying to install it into parallels. and it absolutely always crashes when trying to start the X server since it starts with this crazy resolution.
2008-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	neohaven		even if I select my screen resolution manually on boot, the liveCD goes to like 2500xsomething.
2008-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	Byan	neohaven	use the alternative disk
2008-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	neohaven		there is only one, byan

2008-03-01T23:55:00.000Z	neohaven		I ordered those CDs from canonical because, exactly, I can't really practically download the thing.
