2007-02-01T14:54:00.000Z	neocortex		Hi! Has anyone a problem with the Evolution that crashes on exit?
2007-02-01T14:55:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	Evolution is notoriusly buggy
2007-02-01T14:55:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	But, what to do? I need some planner, mailer and stuff??? :(
2007-02-01T14:56:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	do you need to connect to an Exchange server?
2007-02-01T14:56:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	No ... I use regular pop and smtp
2007-02-01T14:58:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	Any mail / calendar app should work for you then.  Avoid Evolution unless you need Exchange connectivity.
2007-02-01T14:58:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	Do you have any recomendation?
2007-02-01T14:59:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	And what for calendar, task etc.?
2007-02-01T15:00:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	I use a webmail interface for my own website's email etc.  As far as a desktop app, I'm not sure.  You're using Ubuntu I assume.
2007-02-01T15:00:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	Yes 6.06, and tom: I am just telling about my Evolution crashes
2007-02-01T15:01:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	Let me look around a bit...
2007-02-01T15:01:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	thanks, so very much ...
2007-02-01T15:03:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	you could try Mozilla Mail and Mozilla Calendar.  I never used them so I can't tell you too much about them.
2007-02-01T15:04:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	Ok I could try ... Also, since you are so kind :) and I am a newbie, what about good editor?
2007-02-01T15:04:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	I had some troubles with gedit, but generally ...
2007-02-01T15:04:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	What kind of editor?  Text?
2007-02-01T15:04:00.000Z	neocortex		Yes, for python, C, latex ... much R
2007-02-01T15:05:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	I'm old school, so for text is use vi.  Can't tell you as far as a GUI goes.  If vi is to complicated, you could try nano, pico, etc...
2007-02-01T15:06:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	You know, I don't want to star new war, but 1/2 people is telling me GVim, other half emacs ...
2007-02-01T15:06:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	you would be starting a war... :)
2007-02-01T15:06:00.000Z	neocortex		Yes, I know :)
2007-02-01T15:07:00.000Z	neocortex	cheetah	Nevertheless, thanks so much for the assistance ... I owe you a coffee or beer, or both :)
2007-02-01T15:07:00.000Z	cheetah	neocortex	np
