2005-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	onkarshinde		What is purpose of backports repository?
2005-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	for people who are too impatient to wait for the next release of ubuntu
2005-08-31T16:31:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	it includes newer versions of a few programs than are found in the base hoary repositories
2005-08-31T16:31:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Are these backports for new features in apps or just bug fixes?
2005-08-31T16:31:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Ok got the answer
2005-08-31T16:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Can you please tell me what is reboot=b kernel boot option for?
2005-08-31T16:41:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	according to a quick google search it means the kernel will use a different method of rebooting the computer to the standard method (which is to use the keyboard controller)
2005-08-31T16:44:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Uthini: I am having trouble rebooting my HP laptop. No problem in shutdown. And I see this option as default boot option to kernel.
2005-09-10T14:55:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	it's better, but has almost no useful hardware support outside cheap far east OEM players
2005-10-16T15:12:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	I never had problem with extra repos.
2005-10-16T15:13:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	how wonderful for you :)
2005-10-18T15:36:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	not in breezy
2005-10-19T16:21:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	if it was me I'd go with a ~3gb / and make the rest be /home
2005-10-19T16:22:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Thanks for suggestion. I can keep /home less than 3 GB since I already have 30 GB just for any damn thing I may store on my machine.
2005-10-19T16:23:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	fair enough :)
2005-10-19T16:53:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	the helix player doesn't have real codecs though
2005-12-19T06:21:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	I think there are some obex ftp tools for doing that
2005-12-19T06:21:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Isn't there any GUI thing in hoary?
2005-12-19T06:22:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	not as far as I know
2005-12-19T06:24:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Do you know how to use a blutooth enabled GPRS phone as modem?
2005-12-19T06:26:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	yes, you need to use rfcomm to bind to the dialup interface of the phone, then that creates a fake serial device you can use to access the phone and get connected
2005-12-19T06:26:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Ng	Ok. Thanks
2005-12-19T06:26:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	http://www.teaparty.net/technotes/blue-gprs.html has some details, you can probably skip the early bits because bluez is installed already
2005-12-19T06:48:00.000Z	Ng	onkarshinde	if you're converting from one compressed format to another you will lose quality
