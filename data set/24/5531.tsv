2008-01-09T16:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	May we assume you used sudo dpkg-reconfigure etc...
2008-01-09T16:23:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	you mean with "sudo"? Yes, I used it.
2008-01-09T16:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	Did you look at xorg with nano to see what it shows if anything?
2008-01-09T16:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	I am assuming you only have cli on that box.
2008-01-09T16:24:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	 no, I have a GUI, too
2008-01-09T16:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	Please post your xorg to the pastebin...
2008-01-09T16:25:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	sure.

2008-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	it just quits when has configured keyboard and mouse options
2008-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	May I ask .. if you ever tried to use automatix?
2008-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	no, I don't know it. Shall I try?
2008-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	Not that it is a good idea, but it has caused some odd problems like this
2008-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	I was mostly trying to make sure you had not.
2008-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	ah, ok. No, I have not.
2008-01-09T16:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	I am still trying to figure out your problem.. not trying to ignore you.
2008-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	ok, no worries! Thank you! I have an other perfectly working linux partition installed on my computer, can I just copy the xorg.conf file from there?
2008-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	You should be able to...
2008-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	I've replaced the xorg.conf file, but when rebooting X didn't work anymore. So I reconfigure again xorg, but with the same problems... so nothing better here.
2008-01-09T16:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	that is too wierd. something serious is going on on that partition/install...
2008-01-09T16:55:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	I guess it could be beacause I installed the command line system first and then gnome... however it's my second ubuntu partition, I won't bother so much, I'll fix it sooner or later. Thank you very much for your help.
2008-01-09T16:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davide	Welcome, let me know what you find out
2008-01-09T16:56:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	ok!
2008-01-09T17:25:00.000Z	davide	Jack_Sparrow	I fixed it!!! Yey!!! I was loading the old kernel, now I changed the grub and everything seems to be ok!
