2006-08-12T10:10:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	gdm is going to use the highest available resolution in xorg.conf
2006-08-12T10:11:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	even if the default resolution for the desktop is not the highest
2006-08-12T10:12:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	check your X log file, see what resolutions are being used
2006-08-12T10:14:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	ok, so it is falling back on default modes after deciding that there are no usable modes in xorg.conf
2006-08-12T10:14:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	so if it finds a usable mode in xorg.conf, it won't do that
2006-08-12T10:16:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	do you know how to force a refresh rate?
2006-08-12T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	you can specify it during dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-08-12T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	it will list the ones it believes your card and monitor can handle.  if you select from those, it will work because it's the same logic that decides whether or not a mode is usable
2006-08-12T10:27:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	no go
2006-08-12T10:28:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	I tried the reconfigure, and the only thing that it did was add two lines for horiz and vert refresh
2006-08-12T10:28:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	but they look like they are not doing what I want
2006-08-12T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	you didn't select medium for the type of resolutions to specify
2006-08-12T10:29:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	yes I did, why?
2006-08-12T10:29:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	when it gives you simple, medium, and complex (or whatever the words are), you have to select the medium option.  that will show you refresh rates and vertical syncs
2006-08-12T10:29:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	there isn't any way to accept selected resolution and refresh rate and not update xorg.conf
2006-08-12T10:29:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	it asked for what resolution and refresh, it did not have 1280x768, but I picked one with 60Hz
2006-08-12T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	did you use one that was already selected when you got to the screen listing resolutions?
2006-08-12T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	only the ones that have check marks next to them are possible
2006-08-12T10:30:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	no because it was at 85Hz
2006-08-12T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	only the ones checked when you get to that screen will work.
2006-08-12T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	gleaken	is it possibly not correctly identifying your monitor?
2006-08-12T10:31:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	ok, let me try again
2006-08-12T10:32:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	no, itis finding that it is a Pioneer, and giving me the correct model number
2006-08-12T10:35:00.000Z	gleaken	sethk	bbiam going to try again
