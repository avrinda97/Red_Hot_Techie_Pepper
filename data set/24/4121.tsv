2007-07-06T10:51:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	try disabling both ACPI  and APIC
2007-07-06T10:52:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	I mean as a kernel parameter, not in your BIOS.
2007-07-06T10:52:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	a boot parameter.
2007-07-06T11:05:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	It is most likely a hardware conflict. Can you post your system specs at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/   and then provide a link here for us to look at?
2007-07-06T11:06:00.000Z	Hitomaro	mongolai	ok
2007-07-06T11:24:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	did you get that pastebin up?
2007-07-06T11:27:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	was this a pre-built PC, and if so what make/model#
2007-07-06T11:28:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	and you downloaded the x86 version of ubuntu?
2007-07-06T11:29:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	I'm looking up your motherboard now... I'll be back in a few minutes...
2007-07-06T11:31:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	yea I know. I'm looking for any common linux-based issues with it
2007-07-06T11:34:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	this is one of the first links I've found. Doesn't look too promising so far: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=160230    lemme look around a bit more
2007-07-06T11:36:00.000Z	Hitomaro	mongolai	not promising at all. :(
2007-07-06T11:40:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	lemme check it out..
2007-07-06T11:42:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	is the onboard graphics card disabled it the BIOS?
2007-07-06T11:43:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	do that first. You have a nice 7600 anyway!
2007-07-06T11:44:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	I don't know exactly. Go into the CMOS/BIOS  settings when you reboot...
2007-07-06T11:44:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	yea
2007-07-06T11:45:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	well, at least that's promising, no?!
2007-07-06T11:47:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	first disable the on-board graphics in the BIOS, then just try the live-cd again.
2007-07-06T12:01:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	no good so far?
2007-07-06T12:02:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	you should download the alternate cd and try that. then we can get X working later.
2007-07-06T12:02:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	I'm looking at that...NOW
2007-07-06T12:08:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	here in this channel!
2007-07-06T12:09:00.000Z	mongolai	Hitomaro	but you think you've found a solution?
