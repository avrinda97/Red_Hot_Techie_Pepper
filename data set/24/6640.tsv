2005-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	there are no Breezy backports yet, if that's what you're looking for
2005-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	I was clearing it up for someone else :-\
2005-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	System menu - Prefs - Keyboard shortcuts
2005-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	Theres no "command" option?
2005-11-15T12:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	You want an address bar?
2005-11-15T12:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	do you mean assigning kb shortcuts via terminal? no idea, I'm afraid
2005-11-15T12:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	no, I like the buttons
2005-11-15T12:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	You have it in address bar mode and have to keep switching to buttons?
2005-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	nope, it's in button and I switched it to adress w/ Ctrl+L - but hitting Ctrl+L again doesn't switch it back to buttons - restarting Naut. does, though
2005-11-15T12:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	Hmm.
2006-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	extract what into which format?
2006-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	Madpilot	I've tried MP3 and FLAC
2006-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	hmm... flac & ogg both work here, I've never bothered setting up mp3 ripping
2006-03-18T06:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stormx2	there will be community meetings on Tuesday
