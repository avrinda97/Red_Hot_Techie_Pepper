2008-06-03T04:02:00.000Z	m1dn1ght		Hey guys - my screen resolution changed itself when I booted up and now I can't select anything above 800x600.  I was at 1200x800.  Any ideas why?
2008-06-03T04:03:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	try seeing the restricted drivers? did you change something or updated some packages?
2008-06-03T04:04:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	I don't think I've installed anything recently.  not sure what you mean when you say seen restricted drivers?
2008-06-03T04:05:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	are you using ubuntu with gnome? if so, go to restricted drivers section in the menu and see wether they are checked or not.
2008-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	 Which menu are you referring to?  The screen resolution menu?  If so nothing like that there.  Can't see a restricted drivers option in any of the other menus either
2008-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	I am using Gnome btw
2008-06-03T04:09:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	third menu from the left. 1st: programs 2nd places. third menu, there find restricted drivers.
2008-06-03T04:09:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	not there now,but am just installing "Ubuntu restricted extras" package
2008-06-03T04:09:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	that is not the triver, but mp3, mpeg rar, flash etc support.
2008-06-03T04:10:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	there has to be an icon in the menu that sais restricted drivers.
2008-06-03T04:10:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	in that case, I'm going to System -->  Administration  but there's nothing saying restricted drivers
2008-06-03T04:10:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	that is odd. there has to be. what graph card are you using.
2008-06-03T04:11:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	try that:)
2008-06-03T04:11:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	 should have mentioned I was on Hardy.  Thanks Slart!!
2008-06-03T04:12:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	what graphic do you have?
2008-06-03T04:19:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	i am here, sorry, on the other channel. try fiddling with resolution window. chane the monitor type. but before that try ctrl plus alt plus + or - combo
2008-06-03T04:20:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	sorry for beeing late:)
2008-06-03T04:21:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	 no worries mate :).  Free advise requires patience!  "Screen Resolution" window only gives me 3 options.   resolution, refresh rate and rotation as well as "detect displays".  No option to change monitor type.  That key combination does nothing for me unfortunately.
2008-06-03T04:22:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	try detecting it again:(
2008-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	prodigy	nope - unfortunately just says "unknown" in the middle.  Clicking detect does nothing.  As far as I know I had only been using basic VESA drivers.  no idea why it would suddenly poop itself without any stimulus
2008-06-03T04:24:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	it pooped indeed. try googling it. might help. if noone here can help:(
2008-06-03T04:25:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	no probem mate. good luck though
2008-06-07T03:08:00.000Z	prodigy	m1dn1ght	can you manually find menu.lst?
