2012-05-11T00:22:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	This seems like it may need a UI. I all have access to is CLI.
2012-05-11T00:16:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	the grub configuration command line or linux command line?
2012-05-11T00:17:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	I have access through UNetBooten, not through Grub.
2012-05-11T00:19:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	ahh. have you tried using the ubuntu liveCD instead?
2012-05-11T00:20:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	try this http://www.howopensource.com/2012/05/reinstall-recover-grub-from-ubuntu-12-04-live-cd-usb/
2012-05-11T00:21:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	The liveCD needs the proprietary driver. It doesn't even get me to the loading screen. I will try that link.
2012-05-11T00:22:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	sorry, when you installed ubuntu, did you use the cd?
2012-05-11T00:23:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	I used the alternate install. The live cd needed proprietary driver, so I had no choice.
2012-05-11T00:24:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	ahhhh. hmmmm. one sec.
2012-05-11T00:25:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	problem is, you're going to need the install cd to repair grub. see here http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repairrestorereinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd/
2012-05-11T00:31:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	is that working for you?
2012-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	Just checking the BIOS right now, making sure it isn't anything there.
2012-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	what happens when you try to boot into ubuntu?
2012-05-11T00:33:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	can you hold the shift key on reboot and see the grub menu?
2012-05-11T00:33:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	I don't get a choice, GRUB fails to initilize.
2012-05-11T00:35:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	I Had a problem like this in the past. Installer CD was seeing my first SATA RAID card as /dev0-3 and second as dev4-7. it would install grub but it would fail because the bios saw the second sata card as dev0-3
2012-05-11T00:36:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	Which is what i'm checking. Need to clear my CMOS as my bios password seems too secure.
2012-05-11T00:36:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	lol
2012-05-11T01:04:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	Messing with the Bios seems to have fixed it. Not sure if that means GRUB is installed on a different drive
2012-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	file -s /dev/sdX should let you know which drive it's on.
2012-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	try this http://serverfault.com/questions/61400/how-do-i-tell-if-grub-is-installed-on-a-device
2012-05-11T01:07:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	I just realized something. If I need to install the proprietary driver... The alternative CD is still useless. Nouvouro doesn't support my video card.
2012-05-11T01:08:00.000Z	JessicaW	Tm0	:|
2012-05-11T01:09:00.000Z	Tm0	JessicaW	Ahahaa! To GOOOGLE I GO!
