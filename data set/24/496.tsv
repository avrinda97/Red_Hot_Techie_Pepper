2011-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	what problems exactly?
2011-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	uiuiui132		dpkg -l | grep samba
2011-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	uiuiui132		states iHR for samba package
2011-07-27T10:34:00.000Z	uiuiui132	fmauro	any ideas?
2011-07-27T10:35:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	you were trying to install samba directly throught dpkg or regularly through apt?
2011-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uiuiui132		no interenet connection
2011-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uiuiui132		so with dpkg directly
2011-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uiuiui132		apt-cdrom add was giving some errors
2011-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uiuiui132		so i was left with manually installing each package
2011-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uiuiui132		i think i fucked up in some dependencies
2011-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	uiuiui132		and now its in a totally fucked up state.
2011-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	sounds about right. no possibility of an internet connection?
2011-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	uiuiui132		there is. i have to lug it into another room.
2011-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	uiuiui132		if I do that, what commands to rectify the situation?
2011-07-27T10:38:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	you could try and just do a regular package update, if that fails try a apt-get build-dep samba
2011-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	uiuiui132		ok. i shall try that.
2011-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	uiuiui132		thanks.
2011-07-27T10:49:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	if the update fails try doing it directly with dpkg --configure --pending
2011-07-27T10:50:00.000Z	uiuiui132	fmauro	will do. i am going offline now. will be back.
2011-07-27T11:33:00.000Z	uiuiui132	fmauro	thank a lot! sudo apt-get -f install && sudo apt-get build-dep samba
2011-07-27T11:33:00.000Z	uiuiui132		did it for me.
2011-07-27T11:33:00.000Z	fmauro	uiuiui132	cool
