2008-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	pete__		hello, my screen flickers at random.  Its not a hardware issue, but im not sure where to start troubleshooting.  I'm using hte nvidia restricted driver and the issue started in hardy
2008-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	pete__	How are you sure it is not a hardware issue?
2008-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	pete__		possitive
2008-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: 100% sure
2008-05-16T05:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	pete__	Emphasis on the word "how"
2008-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: didnt happy till the day i upgraded to hardy.  Doesnt happen in windows.
2008-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: on fresh install of hardy it went away for a while but jsut came back today
2008-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	RyanPrior	pete__	does it happen on the LiveCD?
2008-05-16T05:37:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: no
2008-05-16T05:38:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: let me explain what i mean by flicker.  the screen seems to like of "refresh" almost... only once. and the display never distorts
2008-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	RyanPrior	pete__	It happens only once?
2008-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: yes.  but at random
2008-05-16T05:39:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: might happen once every 5 minutes or so
2008-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	RyanPrior		That is strange. I would have no clue how to troubleshoot it either.
2008-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	pete__		:(
2008-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	pete__		crap
2008-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	pete__	eugman	its at 60hz
2008-05-16T05:40:00.000Z	pete__	eugman	thats what its always been at... :(
2008-05-16T05:41:00.000Z	RyanPrior		Maybe it should be at 6.005hz?
2008-05-16T05:41:00.000Z	pete__		ryanprior: 6 would be super low wouldnt it?
2008-05-16T05:41:00.000Z	pete__		eugman:whats annoying is it went away :(
2008-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	pete__	eugman	Im thinking its the nvidia restricted driver
2008-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	pete__		however... dont know a lick about it
2008-05-16T05:42:00.000Z	RyanPrior	pete__	restricted drivers suck.
