2005-11-24T09:41:00.000Z	workingmansdead		Hey everyone, I somehow set everything in my system folder to open with VLC Media Player, and now I cannot get into any folders. Please help
2005-11-24T09:42:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	cant get into them what way?
2005-11-24T09:43:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	On the panel, or through the browser, It always tries to open them with VLC
2005-11-24T09:43:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	tries to open files, or directories with vlc?
2005-11-24T09:45:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	Directories, I cant even get to the files. When I click on the "home Folder" icon, and others, such as storage media, It attempts to open the foldier with VLC
2005-11-24T09:45:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	so, for example, under your home, the dirs open with vlc?
2005-11-24T09:46:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	No, It attempts to open "home" with VLC, I cant even get to the dirs.
2005-11-24T09:46:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	open a terminal, and type sudo ls -lf /
2005-11-24T09:47:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	can you post on paste.ubuntulinux.nl what it tells you?
2005-11-24T09:48:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	it shows all my dirs, and numbers to go with them
2005-11-24T09:49:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	lets use paste.ubuntulinux.nl from now on.
2005-11-24T09:49:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	try ls -l ~ and paste on the web site.
2005-11-24T09:50:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	right, man. For the record, I use kubuntu, but they differ only in the KDE
2005-11-24T09:54:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	I put dabaR in the "name" input box, correct
2005-11-24T09:54:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	anything will do.
2005-11-24T09:59:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	alright, I posted
2005-11-24T10:00:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	I would like to see ls -l ~, not ls -lf ~
2005-11-24T10:02:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	alright, done
2005-11-24T10:02:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	is that correct
2005-11-24T10:02:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	have you asked in #kubuntu?
2005-11-24T10:03:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	yes, no reply. The two are basically the same
2005-11-24T10:04:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	I understand, it is just likely something to do with kde. since it looks fine under the hood.
2005-11-24T10:04:00.000Z	workingmansdead	dabaR	alright man, thanks for your help
2005-11-24T10:06:00.000Z	dabaR	workingmansdead	you can use the terminal for now.
