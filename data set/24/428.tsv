2011-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	urlin2u		 alan502_ what makes you think you need a graphics driver?
2011-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	alan502_	urlin2u	the resolution is not showing properly and the ubuntu effects are at the simplest
2011-09-12T05:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	alan502_	have you updated and looked in additional drivers?

2011-09-12T05:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	alan502_	you have a additional drivers you just have to find it, what you need may be there, or what is running now may support a different resolution but needs to be set up your kind of going in a backwards way here.
2011-09-12T05:52:00.000Z	alan502_	urlin2u	the thing is, when i try to start normal or extra effects it doesnt work
2011-09-12T05:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	alan502_	as far as resolution I can't help but sisnce that is your problem I would go from that route on this channel with using this command to isolate the graphic card.  lspci | grep VGA
2011-09-12T05:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	alan502_	yes the effects don't work it may be that a later release has al the support yo need for the card download a Natty cd and see if they do on a live cd boot.
