2007-11-23T02:27:00.000Z	emma		is there a way to get rid of gnome without getting rid of ubuntu and then putting xubuntu on it?
2007-11-23T02:27:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	sure, just remove gnome.
2007-11-23T02:29:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde where it says "remove ubuntu"
2008-05-11T04:39:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	-doc, -marketing, or -offtopic would be better places to ask
2008-05-26T00:19:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	They're identical
2008-07-13T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X31
2008-08-11T09:04:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	Yes please make him take it elsewhere.
2008-09-01T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	the top radio button
2008-09-01T11:54:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	yes, but that radio button has text over the top of it.
2008-09-01T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	In which browser?
2008-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	which version? (Ubuntu version will suffice)
2008-09-01T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	File a bug about it on LP
2008-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website
2008-09-01T12:00:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	alright.
2009-03-09T04:51:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	you're looking for audio loopback.
2009-03-09T04:52:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	okay this sounds promising.
2009-10-12T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	or if its just a once-in-a-while thing, you can switch to a TTY and restart gdm
2009-11-05T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	Debian (and therefore Ubuntu) don't have differences in the general purpoes runlevels (you could certainly set some up though)
2009-11-05T09:34:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	maybe it would be a better learning experience to install and dual boot Ubuntu Server
2009-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	Server doesn't either.  If you want to turn off your GUI, just ctrl-alt-f1 and stop gdm (sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop)
2009-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	oh cool and then you can start it up again with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start I guess
2009-11-05T09:36:00.000Z	emma	Flannel	anyway to comment out or prevent gdm from starting by default?  what about just changing the name of gdm to gdm-temp-disabled
2009-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	Use update-rc.d to disable it in your chosen runlevel(s)
2009-11-05T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	emma	Or BUM, obviously.
