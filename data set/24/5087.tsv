2006-11-25T16:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I need to know how to mount a device which shows up in /var/log/syslog as "Nov 25 17:48:42 experimental kernel: [78887.680000]  usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 5"
2006-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Any suggestions?
2006-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	is it a pen drive?
2006-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Digital voice recorder, flash memory.
2006-11-25T16:54:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	it should mount itself (if it's a usb masss storage device). to use the voice recording function, try selecting it as an alsa audio device
2006-11-25T16:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	I don't need to use it while connected, just transfer files.  (They're recorded as wav)
2006-11-25T16:55:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	doesn't it mount itself???
2006-11-25T16:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Doesn't look like it
2006-11-25T16:55:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	when you plug in, say, a pen drive, does it mount automatically?
2006-11-25T16:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Yes
2006-11-25T16:57:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	dunno waht to do then. sorry :( i hope someone else can fix your problem
2006-11-25T16:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	, sladen: There is no /dev/sd* for it
2006-11-25T16:58:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	it probably isnt a mass storage device, but i've had an idea - how did you access it in windoze/mac?
2006-11-25T16:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	, sladen: Shows in 'lsusb' as Bus 002 Device 005: ID 07b4:020d Olympus Optical Co., Ltd Digital Voice Recorder VN-240PC
2006-11-25T16:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	I didn't.  I don't have either.
2006-11-25T16:59:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	:s how does it say you should trnasfer files from it in windoze/mac
2006-11-25T16:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	, sladen: Which isn't actually the model number, but right brand
2006-11-25T17:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Win has an audio editor program that also handles the file transfer
2006-11-25T17:00:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	was that a program which came with it? what was it?
2006-11-26T17:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	"Olympus Digital Wave Player"
2006-11-26T17:03:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	sladen: it might work in wine - try it
2006-11-26T17:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Maybe another day for that route - don't have time for Wine fiddling tonight.  If it's recognized by lsusb though, shouldn't I be able to use it natively?
2006-11-26T17:05:00.000Z	alecjw	tonyyarusso	i don't think it acts as a mass storage device, so it can detect it but can't drive it
2006-11-26T17:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	alecjw	Hmm
