2012-02-26T17:13:00.000Z	Somelauw		Can anyone help me upgrade from 10.10 to 11.4?
2012-02-26T17:15:00.000Z	Somelauw		It had something to do with broken packages.
2012-02-26T17:17:00.000Z	Somelauw		It is probably easier to download ubuntu from scratch then removing anything I didn't install by using some update manager.
2012-02-26T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 theres the various ppa-purge tools also.
2012-02-26T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 ive never noticed it forceeing irc to close.
2012-02-26T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 not 'all'  but you can do them one at a time.
2012-02-26T17:30:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	theadmin: Is everything I installed using sudo make deb considered a third-party package that prevents me from updating or should I just uninstall everything that comes from a ppa?
2012-02-26T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 'sudo make deb' ?
2012-02-26T17:31:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	That's how you make a debian package if you have the source code.
2012-02-26T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 cant say ive ever done it that way. :)
2012-02-26T17:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 some coule have the same name/replace packages in the default repos.
2012-02-26T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 i wouldent think that would be counted as a ppa.
2012-02-26T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 i do belive the various tools would count it as a 3rd party.
2012-02-26T17:37:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	But I disabled all ppa
2012-02-26T17:37:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	Only on the ppa's?
2012-02-26T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 id disable them ALL if you want to maxamize your upgrade chances..
2012-02-26T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 upgradeing can be problematic. i tend to do clena installs whenever possible.
2012-02-26T17:39:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	Then is there a way to keep /home?
2012-02-26T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 my /home/ is on its own partion/hard drive. :) so i always keep my /home/
2012-02-26T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 i think the synaptic package manager tool can show a list of them.
2012-02-26T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 log out/back in and try it again. or try it from a clean boot. could be some lock file is stuck.
2012-02-26T18:13:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	I already tried the login trick. I will now do the reboot trick.
2012-02-26T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Somelauw	 you mean 'uninstall everything' ?
2012-02-26T18:38:00.000Z	Somelauw	Dr_willis	Oh finally it stopped. It keeped on generating a new list. After about 7 lists, it finally showed an empty list. Maybe this time it is going to work.
