2007-09-15T09:24:00.000Z	AncientRelic	J0SH	are you using it from VMware in windows?
2007-09-15T09:24:00.000Z	AncientRelic	J0SH	Is your VM set for bridging or NAT?
2007-09-15T09:25:00.000Z	AncientRelic	J0SH	Switch your networking to bridged
2007-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	AncientRelic	J0SH	why stuck?

2007-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	AncientRelic	J0SH	did you reboot the VM after you changed the networking?
