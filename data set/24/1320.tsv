2010-04-12T20:43:00.000Z	jorechp		i install ubuntu 9.10 on my girlfriend pc, and when use firefox freze pc,  any can help me ?
2010-04-12T20:45:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Typically a freeze means some kernel driver is messing up. Which graphics driver does it have?
2010-04-12T20:45:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	is a intel chip integrate
2010-04-12T20:46:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Does it help if you disable visual desktop effects?
2010-04-12T20:49:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	is a 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller
2010-04-12T20:49:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Does it help if you disable visual desktop effects?
2010-04-12T20:57:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	but visual effects is disable i dont understand why pc frezing.
2010-04-12T20:58:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	That is strange.. which version of ubuntu and which version of firefox?
2010-04-12T20:59:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	i using ubuntu 9.10 and firefox version install, but is first time run before install
2010-04-12T21:00:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Maybe you can file a bug report or serach to see if anyone is having a similar problem
2010-04-12T21:02:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	I have a feeling it still may be a problem with the intel driver in karmic. To test this theory, you can try putting Driver "vesa" in the Device section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf and this file can be created with X -configure
2010-04-12T23:28:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	resintall driver intel and continue frezing when use any app firefox, terminal or wherever in X mode
2010-04-12T23:29:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	I didnt say reinstall the driver, I said try using the vesa driver so you can see if that is the problem
2010-04-12T23:32:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	how to make a xorg.conf to use vesa driver, but in /etc/X11 dont exist xorg.conf
2010-04-12T23:33:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	in console put X -configure ?
2010-04-12T23:33:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Yes, its either that command or Xorg -config or something
2010-04-12T23:34:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	ty so much try to make now.. and tell u later
2010-04-12T23:34:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Xorg -configure
2010-04-12T23:35:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Ok, Ill be back later
2010-04-12T23:49:00.000Z	jorechp	soreau	i now using vesa driver and dont' freze..
2010-04-12T23:51:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	Ok, so now you know for sure it's the intel driver
2010-04-12T23:51:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	What I would do is wait for the Lucid release and try again as there's been a lot of changes in the intel driver
2010-04-12T23:53:00.000Z	soreau	jorechp	:)
