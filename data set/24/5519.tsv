2011-01-14T18:00:00.000Z	alberto		Hello everyone
2011-01-14T18:01:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	everyone says hello
2011-01-14T18:18:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	define runs slow
2011-01-14T18:20:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	I'm sorry, my english is not that good, I guess... I mean whenever I open Calc, or Presentations, or whatever, it takes almost 1 minute to complete the task, at least the first time I do it.
2011-01-14T18:22:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	ok, that's helpful to start, have you tried watching in the system monitor?
2011-01-14T18:23:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	I installed Ubuntu 10, which set automatically a swap partition of 1'6GB and another one that I still don't understand the point of 1'6GB too. Then, when I tested the performance, the system monitor reported too much RAM use.
2011-01-14T18:24:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Ubuntu also freezes sometimes.
2011-01-14T18:25:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	By the way, isn't it correct to say "runs slow"? I'm sorry if I typed it wrongly... What would be the right question?
2011-01-14T18:27:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	you're fine. There were other possibilities, like "boots slow" or "freezes when I do this".
2011-01-14T18:30:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	I mean the whole system is very slow.
2011-01-14T18:30:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	ok
2011-01-14T18:32:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Any ideas?
2011-01-14T18:34:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	plenty. Just not about where to have you start. OOo is a pretty hefty program. Does it happen with text editor ?
2011-01-14T18:35:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	The problem is that the memory monitor reports almost 100% RAM load.
2011-01-14T18:36:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	even before you run anything?
2011-01-14T18:36:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Usually 54% physical memory and 40% cache, which gives 96%
2011-01-14T18:37:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	That's when I run OpenOffice.
2011-01-14T18:37:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Without running anything, it gives 80% of RAM load.
2011-01-14T18:37:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	right, so reboot if needed, and try running one instance of text edit
2011-01-14T18:37:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	ooh, for a long time?
2011-01-14T18:38:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Yes, quite a long time.
2011-01-14T18:38:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	alberto	try booting into livecd again and running memory tests, F6 when you see the little keyboard icon at the bottom of the screen
2011-01-14T18:39:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	It remains with that RAM load percentage for quite a long time, let's say 2 hours.
2011-01-14T18:39:00.000Z	alberto	q_a_z_steve	Ok.
