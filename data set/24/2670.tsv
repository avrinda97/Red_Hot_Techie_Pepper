2008-12-18T02:59:00.000Z	Some_Person		Can someone help me? The ubuntu installer and GParted both cannot see the partitions on my drive. They both show a large, unallocated drive.
2008-12-18T03:00:00.000Z	Some_Person		d_smith: Nautilus (the file manager) sees them, and fdisk sees them
2008-12-18T03:02:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	did you try gparted from a live cd?
2008-12-18T03:02:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	This is a live cd
2008-12-18T03:02:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	I am trying to install ubuntu
2008-12-18T03:03:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	and the unalocated space is the full disk-space?
2008-12-18T03:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	Yes. But there should be no unallocated space
2008-12-18T03:05:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	I'm not sure, but maybe your MBR or partition table is broken?
2008-12-18T03:06:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	I already tried using TestDisk to fix it, and it seems like nothing is wrong
2008-12-18T03:07:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	weird, did you try booting from other live cd's? same problem?
2008-12-18T03:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	No I haven't. But I need this one working so I can install ubuntu

2008-12-18T03:09:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	well yes, but maybe you can prepare a partition with a gparted live cd & then reboot from your ubuntu install cd & see if it can find your partitions that way.
2008-12-18T03:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	Partitions are ready. Just need to format and install. This is actually a reinstall attempt at ubuntu
2008-12-18T03:39:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	then there's something wrong with your partitions. repartitioning might help ;( or some tools to fix it (?)
2008-12-18T03:39:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	i am not starting from scratch
2008-12-18T03:40:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	then search for tools to check and fix your master boot record / partition table
2008-12-18T03:40:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	I already tried one of them, called "TestDisk"
2008-12-18T03:41:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	maybe even windows checkdisk and related harddrive things
2008-12-18T03:41:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	chkdsk in windows never does anything
2008-12-18T03:42:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	you mean you tried it?
2008-12-18T03:42:00.000Z	Some_Person	djiezes	Yes, I did
2008-12-18T03:43:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	i know Ultimate  Boot CD has some tools to check & fix mbr and partition tables, you could try that
2008-12-18T03:46:00.000Z	djiezes	Some_Person	another option might be tools offered by the manufacturerer of the harddrive
