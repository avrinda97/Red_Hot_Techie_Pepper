2009-07-08T04:55:00.000Z	th0r	puff	it becomes /dev/video
2009-07-08T04:56:00.000Z	puff	th0r	Don't see it there.  This is a standard digital still camera, canon powershot a520.
2009-07-08T04:56:00.000Z	th0r	puff	ah....those should mount as usb drives
2009-07-08T04:57:00.000Z	th0r	puff	have you turned on the camera?
2009-07-08T04:57:00.000Z	puff	th0r	yeah, it's on and it's in playback mode.
2009-07-08T04:57:00.000Z	th0r	puff	mount should show if it is mounted
2009-07-08T04:58:00.000Z	puff	th0r	mount shows a lot of stuff, but none of it jumps out at me as the camera...
2009-07-08T04:58:00.000Z	th0r	puff	it would show as /dev/sdb or sdc
2009-07-08T04:59:00.000Z	th0r	puff	if you are in gnome it should have put an icon on the desktop for the 'drive'

2009-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	th0r	puff	it appears ubuntu is seeing the camera being plugged in, but not recognizing it as a camera and not mounting it as a drive
2009-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	th0r	puff	what kind of camera?
2009-07-08T05:04:00.000Z	puff	th0r	Nothing on my desktop;  when I look at it in nautilus it's there and it shows me some folders and a message about "This folder contains digital media" and a button to open f-spot.
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	th0r	puff	ok....then nautilus is seeing it. can you open f-spot and see your pictures?
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	puff	th0r	Okay, so I just turned it off and back on, and this time, since i'd installed gthumb, the popup offered to let me open it in gthumb as well as f-spot.
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	puff	th0r	No, when I open f-spot I only see my old pictures.
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	puff	th0r	When I open with gthumb, I get this erropr:
2009-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	puff	th0r	"Unable to mount Canon, Inc. Digital IXUS 50 (normal mode) / IXY Digital 55 (normal mode) / Powershot A520 (PTP mode) / Powershot SD400 (normal mode)" and then in smaller type below it, "Error initializing camera: -60: Could not lock the device."
2009-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	puff	th0r	It's the A520, btw.
2009-07-08T05:09:00.000Z	th0r	puff	found this in a google search http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=250328
2009-07-08T05:10:00.000Z	puff	th0r	Argh... that really, really, really sucks.  Thanks
2009-07-08T05:11:00.000Z	th0r	puff	also found an item that says they can access the camera using gtkam, but that is old info
2009-07-08T05:12:00.000Z	th0r	puff	try, in a terminal, gphoto2 --auto-detect
