2007-01-11T13:54:00.000Z	Kristian		Hi guys, need help for installing X-Plane :P
2007-01-11T13:55:00.000Z	Kristian		How do you run a binary file ? :S
2007-01-11T13:55:00.000Z	Kristian		lol
2007-01-11T13:55:00.000Z	Kristian		Ok
2007-01-11T13:56:00.000Z	Kristian		Quiet -> It says "Error whjile loading shared libraries: libopenal.os.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" What do i do ?
2007-01-11T13:57:00.000Z	Kristian		Its an installer for X-Plane
2007-01-11T13:57:00.000Z	Kristian		quiet - i can link you if you want .. ?
2007-01-11T13:59:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	sudo apt-get install libopenal0a
2007-01-11T14:00:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	you can check dynamic linking by 'ldd <programname>'
2007-01-11T14:03:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	it will display dynamic library linkings and you can check it all exists or not.
2007-01-11T14:03:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> oh, thanks :)
2007-01-11T14:04:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> But the program seems to run, bit i get a new error now "We were unable to open a zip file. It may be missing or damaged"
2007-01-11T14:04:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	so it's not a library missing thing, maybe the program bugous.
2007-01-11T14:05:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> ok, just another thing, i keep having troubles with my graphics driver, so i downloaded the official one from nvidia.com - but i need to execute in, without GUI open, how do i start in "black" ? :S
2007-01-11T14:07:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	do it in tty?, you can switch by CTRL+ALT+1
2007-01-11T14:07:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> tty ?
2007-01-11T14:08:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	and ? wildcard stands for one character.:)
2007-01-11T14:08:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> will try, a sec.
2007-01-11T14:08:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> i tried to write tty1 in the consile "command not found" ..
2007-01-11T14:09:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	it isn't in your $PATH i think, start it with ./
2007-01-11T14:09:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> so sudo ./tty1 ?
2007-01-11T14:10:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	and not write tty1 but the command you want to execute
2007-01-11T14:10:00.000Z	Kristian	stoone	-> i want to close the GUI (gnome, nautilus or whatever), and install nvidia drivers ;)
2007-01-11T14:11:00.000Z	stoone	Kristian	i feel get a bit lost...
