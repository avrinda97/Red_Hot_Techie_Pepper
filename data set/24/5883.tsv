2009-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	Name141		And this seems to be the best possible way without going through oops.
2009-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	Name141		hoops
2009-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	Name141		Yes.
2009-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	Name141		I figure I will need to see if my system runs it good and I can get on Linux native programs
2009-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	Name141		So far I haven't found anything to replace mIRC.
2009-01-18T10:13:00.000Z	Name141		I have all my mIRC scripts ready to go
2009-01-18T10:15:00.000Z	Name141		I suppose I could use "BitchX"
2009-01-18T10:15:00.000Z	Name141		it always had a lot of protection
2009-01-18T10:16:00.000Z	Name141		already built in
2009-01-18T10:17:00.000Z	Name141		Well there went those ideas.
2009-01-18T10:18:00.000Z	Tidus	Name141	i'd just use irssi if you're looking for a good console irc client
2009-01-18T10:18:00.000Z	Name141		Someone once told me of "winex" , which now seems to be a commercial software.
2009-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	Name141		That would run mIRC better
2009-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	Name141		Perhaps I should try different versions of mIRC or upgrade?
2009-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	Name141		(to a newer mIRC)
2009-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	Tidus	Name141	there are several nice irc clients built for linux. my 3 favorites are irssi, xchat, and konversation
2009-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	Name141	Tidus	Any of them protect again flood joining? topic floods? PM floods? DCC floods? private/channel notice floods?
2009-01-18T10:20:00.000Z	Name141		against
2009-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	Tidus	Name141	all of them can be configured to do so
2009-01-18T10:21:00.000Z	Name141	Tidus	When I look for XChat scripts, I find hardly jack.
2009-01-18T10:22:00.000Z	Tidus	Name141	because usually those kinds of things are built-in on a linux irc client
2009-01-18T10:22:00.000Z	Tidus		if you're looking for stuff like flood protection
2009-01-18T10:23:00.000Z	Name141	Tidus	I would assume that xchat for windows could be compaired to the same protection of Xchat for linux
2009-01-18T10:23:00.000Z	Tidus	Name141	x-chat for windows != xchat for linux
