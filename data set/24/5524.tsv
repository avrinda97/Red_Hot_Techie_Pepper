2007-12-01T11:13:00.000Z	greenman		Hello all.  I have a question.  But first I have to say that I'm using ubuntu on a macbook pro using livecd.  That's pretty  c ool
2007-12-01T11:13:00.000Z	greenman		My  question is I'm having problem installing ubuntu on a dell desktop.
2007-12-01T11:13:00.000Z	greenman		It get's to the part that plays the music and the  monitor doesn't show anything
2007-12-01T11:14:00.000Z	greenman		It's like it's not getting a signal
2007-12-01T11:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	what model of Dell
2007-12-01T11:14:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Not sure offhand, I know it's not horribly old.  It plays Halflife 2 and  such.
2007-12-01T11:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	at the start install menu.. try F6 then noapic    , also burning slow helps, or use the alternate-text installer
2007-12-01T11:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	I ask as I have a few around, c610 and c640 d600
2007-12-01T11:15:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	what do you mean by burning slow?
2007-12-01T11:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	when you burn the *.iso.. burn at slowest speed possible
2007-12-01T11:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	The dell should say on the bottom what model it is
2007-12-01T11:16:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, I'm not  there anymore, it's a friends computer.
2007-12-01T11:17:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	I want to say it's an optiplex
2007-12-01T11:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	try those suggestions...  so not a lappy...
2007-12-01T11:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	I also have a gx240 optiplx.. use F6 and noapic
2007-12-01T11:17:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Nah, desktop.  :)
2007-12-01T11:18:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	I'll try  noapic and I'll also Burn a copy  of the text installer if I have to.
2007-12-01T11:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	At least you know it will work with the onboard video or the nvidia plug in as well
2007-12-01T11:19:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, well I think the MBP uses ATI.
2007-12-01T11:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	I thought onboard was intel.. but either way optiplex did work with the option.. You can create a spare partition for data then install to unallocated space.
2007-12-01T11:22:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not sure I do know that I ahve the ati drivers in windows.
2007-12-01T11:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	greenman	it will e fine
2007-12-01T11:23:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, he has two internal disks and one external, he's going to move data from the intern als to the external and then install linux on the main drive in a new partition.
2007-12-01T11:24:00.000Z	greenman	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks for the help, gonna go back into OS X land.  :)
