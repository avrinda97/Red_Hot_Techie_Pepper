2011-07-24T04:57:00.000Z	nicofs		Does anyone know why "apt-get update" would return "404 - not found" for some of the repos?
2011-07-24T04:58:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	try doing an apt-get update
2011-07-24T04:59:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	that is what returns 404 - but if archive does not include arm, then it's obvious wha it returns 404...
2011-07-24T05:01:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	are you using an ARM processor?
2011-07-24T05:01:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	yep...
2011-07-24T05:02:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	apt-get update does that?
2011-07-24T05:03:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	yes... but if rww is right about the normal repos not having arm, it does so rightfully...
2011-07-24T05:05:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	yeah but the packaging system is based on debain which has been ported to toasters and blenders :) Seems your apt is setup to look in the wrong place, im not really sure how to fix it
2011-07-24T05:07:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	at least now i know what's wrong... and i can take it from there...
2012-10-11T04:05:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	is your router blocking icmp traffic? Some call it "DDoS Protection"
2012-10-11T04:06:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	said router works well with every other device in the network
2012-10-11T04:07:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	did you put a tick in the "available to all users" box?
2012-10-11T04:07:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	yes
2012-10-11T04:09:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	'iwconfig'
2012-10-11T04:11:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	can you connect and use other routers?
2012-10-11T04:12:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	i only have that one. I could try connection to the android hot spot from my mobile...
2012-10-11T04:12:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	could be a bad password or such if its only the one router giving you trouble
2012-10-11T04:16:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	ubuntu works pretty good right out of the box when compared to gentoo
2012-10-11T04:17:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	that's what I'm saying...
2012-10-11T04:25:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	its named something else, maybe wlan0 or ra0
2012-10-11T04:26:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	but "iwlist wlan1 scan" gave me the networks...
2012-10-11T04:26:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	"ifconfig wlan1 up" worked aswell...
2012-10-11T04:27:00.000Z	nicofs	pfifo	dmesg: "renamed network interface wlan0 to wlan1"
2012-10-11T04:27:00.000Z	pfifo	nicofs	then im not sure what the problem is
