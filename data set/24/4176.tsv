2007-06-16T15:35:00.000Z	BrightEyes		is there any problems if i install win xp 32 bit and kubuntu 7.04 64 bit? i want to store my mp3s on a fat32 partition so they will be accessible from both o/s
2007-06-16T15:36:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	no problems
2007-06-16T15:36:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	you don't need to use fat32. Linux can read/write ntfs these days.
2007-06-16T15:37:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	and windows can read ext3 if you install a plugin
2007-06-16T15:37:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	pls tell me more about that plugin
2007-06-16T15:37:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	www.fs-driver.org
2007-06-16T15:37:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	I use it myself. It works well.
2007-06-16T15:38:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	basically i want to do everything in ubuntu now.i will buy a web cam and i want to make my microphone work as well(its a simple one set, the phones work fine the mic no)
2007-06-16T15:39:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	do u have a web cam and microphone working with kopete?
2007-06-16T15:39:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	no webcam. I used a microphone once though, on my old laptop.
2007-06-16T15:40:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	whats the reason my mic is not working? on windoze it works fine
2007-06-16T15:40:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	what sound card / chipset do you have?
2007-06-16T15:43:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	on board. asrock
2007-06-16T15:44:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	do an lspci. If it shows a realtek or intelhdachipset, that might be your problem. There are lots of problems with the drivers for those chipsets (I have a realtek HDA and haven't made it work properly yet)
2007-06-16T15:46:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	wait my friend
2007-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	commmand not found..well now im on suse 10.1 :(
2007-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	ubuntu supports all mic?
2007-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	try doing lspci as root
2007-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	i tried that as well -> command not found
2007-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	yes, it supports all microphones but not all sound chipsets
2007-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	ah :/ sorry, I haven't used suse since version 8
2007-06-16T15:48:00.000Z	BrightEyes	SlimeyPete	now what can i do? how can i learn if my chipset is compatible?
2007-06-16T15:49:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	there is a list at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport but it isn't 100% complete
2007-06-16T15:50:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	BrightEyes	other than that,try google. You'll need to find out what chipset you have first, though. Does Suse have a hardware manager application you can use?
