2011-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	truepurple		yeah, thats annoying
2011-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	truepurple		I want to use existing urls
2011-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	truepurple		I saved many a link under windows, I want to just click on them and open a webpage like with windows
2011-06-30T14:35:00.000Z	truepurple		The nature of windows shortcuts are so simple, linux can't manage something that simple? How absurd
2011-06-30T14:36:00.000Z	truepurple		Because its convienant to some users
2011-06-30T14:36:00.000Z	truepurple		I don't know how to do any of that, and that doesn't necessarily make it the better solution
2011-06-30T14:37:00.000Z	truepurple		Why should linux be able to manage web links? Because they are so very simple
2011-06-30T14:39:00.000Z	truepurple		Bookmarks are harder to move around from one browser to another, and if you have alot of them it becomes difficultto manage
2011-06-30T14:40:00.000Z	truepurple		Well the demand might be low, but the difficulty should be pretty low too
2011-06-30T14:41:00.000Z	truepurple		I tried import, its messy, and can't be used to go from one PC to another
2011-06-30T14:41:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	most browsers let you export your bookmarks in html form
2011-06-30T14:41:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	"desktop links" are yet more harder to move
2011-06-30T14:42:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	also FF site lets you manage your bookmarks online and automagically sync it between all your FF instances
2011-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	its not true. Read the text under help menu of the default viewer
2011-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	truepurple	ohir	What is not true?
2011-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	your stetements about default pictures viewer
2011-06-30T14:48:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	it supports fullscreen/slideshow and has big next/previous buttons right at your eyes
2011-06-30T14:48:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	so I assume you are not used ubuntu nor you're using it now. go away
2011-06-30T14:48:00.000Z	truepurple	ohir	How do I get it to show pictures at true size and with the sides expanded fully for default?
2011-06-30T14:49:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	its a system viewer, its not supposed at "default truesize". It defaults to "show me whole picture" as windows and mac system previews do too.
2011-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	truepurple	ohir	it doesn't default to show me whole picture
2011-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	for other picture managing software go to ubuntu's software center and pick one that suits
2011-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	truepurple	ohir	how do I change the defaults with system?
2011-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	ohir	truepurple	For me it does. Read helps and manuals. EOT.
