2007-10-30T21:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic		binarydigit: are you sure you need the nvidia drivers from their website? They are in the repos..
2007-10-30T21:35:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	 i read somewhere that repo doesnt keep latest..correct ?
2007-10-30T21:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	I don't know, to be honest
2007-10-30T21:38:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	ok i c its downloading same file from repo but doesnt look like its for 64 bit arch
2007-10-30T21:38:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	nevermind didnt see you response
2007-10-30T21:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	don't know about 64 bit - I have an old 2 GHz Celeron :)
2007-10-30T21:39:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	thanks mate ill give it a go from repo than work my way back if it fails
2007-10-30T21:41:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	 looks like all good it was d/l a 64 bit version.
2007-10-30T21:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	ah, good
2007-10-30T21:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	you'll probably find most people here use a dedicated irc client like irssi or xchat
2007-10-30T21:46:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	ahh yes rings a bell cheers
2007-10-30T21:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	install xchat if you prefer graphical clients
2007-10-30T21:48:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	xchat = better program than pidgin in your opinion ?
2007-10-30T21:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	for irc, definitely
2007-10-30T21:50:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	cheers
2007-10-30T22:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	it's wise to change your router password :)
2007-10-30T23:36:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	 trying to install nvidia-settings and its asking me to uninstall nvidia-glx-new............any ideas ?
2007-10-30T23:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	not really - I have a known-good xorg.conf that I just plug in, and it works. I know very little about nvidia's binary blobs
2007-10-30T23:38:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	thanks ill try andy solution
2007-10-31T00:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	I learnt most of my Linux idling in #debian some years ago :)
2007-10-31T00:02:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	which is what i should have done ..instead of winblows
2007-10-31T00:06:00.000Z	b1n42y	thoreauputic	andycr: Do you guys get paid for this? I assume not.
2007-10-31T00:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	b1n42y	hahah - umm, no
