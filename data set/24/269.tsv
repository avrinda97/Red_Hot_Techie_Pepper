2012-06-21T02:30:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	vfat and ntfs can be shared between linux and windows. ExFAT is wondows only. Ext3/4 etc are linux only. Use disk utility.
2012-06-21T02:30:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	ok how so i reformat it?
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	use disk utility or gparted. But you'll lose anything on the drive
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	i dont have access to a windows computer
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	ok
2012-06-21T02:31:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	where is dick utility
2012-06-21T02:32:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	i found it
2012-06-21T02:33:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE THE COIMPUTER USE SOME OF THE HARD DRIVE AS RAM SO MY COMPUTER IS FASTER?
2012-06-21T02:34:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	caps lock sorry
2012-06-21T02:34:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	do you mean using a flash drive as cache, like you can do in Windows?
2012-06-21T02:35:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	no
2012-06-21T02:35:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	just enything that can make my compuiter faster and i have tons of room left on  the hard drive so i figured why not
2012-06-21T02:36:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	accessing the hard drive is one of the slowest things you can do. Swapping to the hd causes slowdowns
2012-06-21T02:36:00.000Z	iggymydog	mcphail	is there enything i can do?
2012-06-21T02:37:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	if you have plenty of RAM you can cache frequently used programs on a ramdisk
2012-06-21T02:37:00.000Z	mcphail	iggymydog	but Linux is smart enough that that will make little difference
