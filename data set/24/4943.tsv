2007-01-18T17:41:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	does your machine recognize any of the remote keys you hit at the moment?
2007-01-18T17:41:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	using the gnome-keybindings-properties program i got it to do the volume
2007-01-18T17:42:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	brilliant- thanks

2007-01-29T12:18:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	I completely concur with Pici
2007-01-29T12:19:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	and Pici, any apps in particular?
2007-01-29T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	find and xargs
2007-01-29T12:19:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	i havent discovered xargs and is find better than locate?
2007-01-29T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	two different kettle of fish
2007-01-29T12:21:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	find all files in your home folder that were created today and search them for 'string': 'find ~ -mtime -1 -print0 | xargs -0 grep string'
2007-01-29T12:22:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	so is the print0 the bit to send it to xargs with the -0
2007-01-29T12:23:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	yes. You can do without -print0 and -0 if you don't use spaces or tabs in your filenames.
2007-01-29T12:24:00.000Z	soundray	hjmills	I will try saving some time now using Ctrl-Q on my IRC client... Bye
2007-01-29T12:24:00.000Z	hjmills	soundray	thanks :D that is helpful
