2005-06-25T13:08:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	thells dpkg to ask questions with low priority
2005-06-25T13:09:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	instead of high, wich is default on ubuntu
2005-06-25T13:10:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	it will ask for sync ranges
2005-06-25T13:10:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	what the diff is?
2005-06-25T13:10:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	well, if you set high priority to dpkg, it will ask you only the questions he can't resolve by it's self...
2005-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	ivoks	ok, i'll keep it in mind, anything else we can try?
2005-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	then it asked you for your monitor, to choose, simple, medium or hard
2005-06-25T13:11:00.000Z	ivoks	thechitowncubs	it's enough to choose simple, and then choos 17" monitor
