2006-08-03T12:34:00.000Z	josh_frca		hello all... i run windows and linux on this system .... windows seems to work fairly fast (this is a pentium M 1.7 ghz)... linux doesn't work as fast as it should... what could i be doing wrong
2006-08-03T12:35:00.000Z	silentread	josh_frca	did u install drivers for your hardware on your computer?
2006-08-03T12:35:00.000Z	josh_frca		for linux... no i didn't
2006-08-03T12:35:00.000Z	josh_frca		everything works fine... but when i browse the web.. it's kinda slow
2006-08-03T12:36:00.000Z	josh_frca		im running a dsl up to 3.0mbps
2006-08-03T12:36:00.000Z	silentread		john_frca, is ur internet running slow, or the browser (as in system performance)
2006-08-03T12:37:00.000Z	josh_frca		welll the browser isnt as responsive
2006-08-03T12:37:00.000Z	josh_frca		dsl reports show speeds that are fairly high
2006-08-03T12:37:00.000Z	silentread	josh_frca	the reason windows is running faster is b/c the drivers are telling windows how to use the hardware, while in Linux, generic drivers can not take advantage of your hardware
2006-08-03T12:37:00.000Z	josh_frca		how do i fix that silentread???
2006-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	silentread	josh_frca	what type of graphics card do you have?
2006-08-03T12:38:00.000Z	josh_frca		it's an integrated intel card
2006-08-03T12:39:00.000Z	silentread	josh_frca	what i would recommend is that you search if your hardware vendor for your graphics card makes a linux version of its driver, if so I would recommnend installing that
2006-08-03T12:39:00.000Z	josh_frca	silentread	its a dell inspiron... ive checked their site.. they don't list anything
