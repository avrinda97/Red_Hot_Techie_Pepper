2008-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	nickrud		!medibuntu | deea should still be live
2008-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	I've tried it, even the site has no pool listing
2008-05-27T06:56:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	the pool is at packages.medibuntu.org , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu has the relevant instructions
2008-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	fde gave you the correct directory, you can just download the right w32codecs and dpkg -i them
2008-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	you try it and tell me if it work
2008-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	to me it says page non trouvee
2008-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	that's how I always get my w32codecs. And I have it open in my browser this second
2008-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	do you know ftp pass? It seems to work by ftp
2008-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	them something's screwed on my side...
2008-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	no, I just doubleclicked the link in xchat to open the dir
2008-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	pls ping it for me
2008-05-27T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	got return from dunnewind.net
2008-05-27T07:06:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	you can try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu#head-381bea41610683e5e26322fd7028e7aef85e3105-2 , it uses wget
2008-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	skip all this high level stuff, just get the w32codecs package directly using wget, and install them with dpkg. It's not like they have any dependency issues
2008-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	 finally !
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	I gave you a link on how to do that a while back ;)
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	no I did import that gpg key :D
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	hahahha
2008-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	what's about that key after all?
2008-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	if you have the key, now apt-get install should work fine (assuming you've added the repo line)
2008-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	I mean is some sort of authentication or what?
2008-05-27T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	yes. The gpg key signs the repository, giving you some assurance that the packages are safe
2008-05-27T07:14:00.000Z	deea	nickrud	I see. Thanks for everything.
2008-05-27T07:15:00.000Z	nickrud	deea	gpg basically tells you that you are getting something from the person that owns the key
