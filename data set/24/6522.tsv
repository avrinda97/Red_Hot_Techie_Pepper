2005-09-29T13:53:00.000Z	acad		i have a problem, i have some stuff that says i have unmet dependencies when i go to install a program,  *i can't do a apt-get -f install* cause it says it's going to remove half the system.  how do i remove the items that have unmet dependincies instead?
2005-09-29T13:54:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	what program ?
2005-09-29T13:54:00.000Z	acad		libc6-dev
2005-09-29T13:55:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	any non ubuntu repositories in your sources.list ?
2005-09-29T13:55:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	libc6-dev is the program with unmet depenencies
2005-09-29T13:55:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	yea (accidently)  but i fixed it
2005-09-29T13:55:00.000Z	acad		i caut it pretty quick
2005-09-29T13:55:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	maybe there kies your prob then
2005-09-29T13:56:00.000Z	acad		yea-  i know the problem. i want to fix it hehe
2005-09-29T13:56:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	what alien repo did you have in your sources.lis ?
2005-09-29T13:57:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	*a private one*  it was from a company i work for...
2005-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	and did you use ubuntuguide to set up your os ?
2005-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	i didn't set it up
2005-09-29T13:58:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	so i don't know
2005-09-29T13:59:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	are there backport repo's in your sources.list ?
2005-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	acad		the private repository which i used by acident and canceled which caused this is newer then the ubuntu one
2005-09-29T14:00:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	if that makes any sense
2005-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	not sure what to do about your prob exept vor removal of all "alien packages and reinstall the origina ones
2005-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	acad	deFrysk	how would i remove all alien packages?
2005-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	acad		apt-get won't let me remove anything until i fix the issue
2005-09-29T14:01:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	you installed them , so hunt htem down I would say
2005-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	acad		ok,  i know the package- but how would i remove it?
2005-09-29T14:02:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	another solution might be upgrading to breezy
2005-09-29T14:03:00.000Z	deFrysk	acad	althoug breezy is still under development
