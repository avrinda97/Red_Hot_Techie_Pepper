2010-05-23T06:10:00.000Z	toolbear		help!  made custom ubuntu live cd, but it can't detect hard disk!  what can i do to fix this problem?
2010-05-23T06:11:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	What kind of hard disk do you have?
2010-05-23T06:11:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	What do you see in the output of   fdisk -l
2010-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	What do you see in the output of  sudo fdisk -l
2010-05-23T06:12:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	i put it up at http://paste.linuxassist.net/215277
2010-05-23T06:14:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	It says "authorization required"
2010-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	bart_: anyways, it is detecting my usb drive without any problem, but i don't even have /dev/sdb (/dev/sda is now the usb drive) or /dev/hda
2010-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	Try pastebin.com
2010-05-23T06:15:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	um, really?  i thought it gave a pop-up just saying that you are supposed to type in "linux" for both usr and password.  anyways, i'll put it at pastebin
2010-05-23T06:19:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	ok, http://pastebin.com/2g8dMGmx
2010-05-23T06:22:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	Well, it appears you were wrong.  It does seem to be recognizing one hard disk drive: "/dev/sda: 4007 MB, 4007624704 bytes"
2010-05-23T06:22:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	no, that's my usb drive!
2010-05-23T06:23:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	Is this a desktop or laptop?
2010-05-23T06:23:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	desktop
2010-05-23T06:24:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	So it's an sata drive?
2010-05-23T06:24:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	ok, now i've taken out my flash drive, here's what happens: "root@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu# fdisk -l
2010-05-23T06:24:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	yep
2010-05-23T06:25:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	Could there be a hardware problem?  Is the drive plugged in good?  Is the data cable plugged in and the power cable as well?
2010-05-23T06:28:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	it's possible, but there never has been a hardware problem, and there wasn't one before i booted into this live cd...
2010-05-23T06:33:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	ok, i'm now on ubuntu booted from my hard drive, so there is no hardware problem
2010-05-23T06:37:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	actually, i'm now running the live cd in qemu, and it can detect the hard disk just fine...(i'm using "qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom /dev/cdrom -hda /dev/sda")
2010-05-23T06:37:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	so, evidently, the live cd works just fine when it's in an emulator, but not when i actually boot off of it...
2010-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	usr13	toolbear	Hummm... not sure what to make of that...
2010-05-23T06:38:00.000Z	toolbear	usr13	well, thanks for your help anyways
