2009-12-01T18:23:00.000Z	jacekowski		and no response to any of them
2009-12-01T18:23:00.000Z	jacekowski		but somebody had time to strip down gdm configurator
2009-12-01T18:23:00.000Z	jacekowski		to 5 options
2009-12-01T18:23:00.000Z	jacekowski		instead of normall configurator

2009-12-01T18:23:00.000Z	jacekowski		it's getting worse every release
2009-12-01T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	jacekowski	whining here accomplishes nothing other than me caring less about helping you
2009-12-01T18:24:00.000Z	jacekowski	jrib	i don't want your help
2009-12-01T18:25:00.000Z	jacekowski	jrib	i fixed it myself

2009-12-01T18:25:00.000Z	jacekowski	jrib	but there is loads of people that come to -pl and ask same questions
2009-12-01T18:26:00.000Z	jacekowski		you can help my by not adding untested software to distribution that is used by normal users that don't know anything about PC
2009-12-01T18:26:00.000Z	jacekowski		me*
2009-12-01T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	jacekowski	this is open source, bugs happen.  Document the fix on the bug report and point them there.  You said you found duplicates, but I don't see any.  One way to help triage the bug, is to mark all the duplicates so that developers can work on the issue more easily
