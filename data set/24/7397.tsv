2005-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	Slaven		argh
2005-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	Slaven		why are there TWO Windows-keys on most keyboards?
2005-02-13T08:10:00.000Z	Slaven		TWO?! it doesn't make sense!
2005-02-13T08:10:00.000Z	Slaven		even ONE doesn't make sense. TWO makes ultra little sense.
2005-02-13T08:11:00.000Z	Slaven		The windows key has ONE function in Windows. Anyone ever really use it? I always clicked.
2005-02-13T08:12:00.000Z	zeedo	Slaven	yep, I use it alot for quick access to menu entries eg... winkey-r-enter
2005-02-13T08:13:00.000Z	Slaven		I bet most Windows-users click the start menu.
2005-02-13T08:13:00.000Z	zeedo		you can also use it in shortcuts eg... winkey+e runs explorer
2005-02-13T08:13:00.000Z	Slaven		it's just annoying when you're gaming.
2005-02-13T08:13:00.000Z	zeedo	Slaven	any good game should disable it
2005-02-13T08:13:00.000Z	Slaven		ok, I'm no expert. just seems stup with two winkeys and only one real alt.
2005-02-13T08:14:00.000Z	Slaven		stup+D
2005-02-13T08:14:00.000Z	Slaven		-+I
2005-02-13T08:14:00.000Z	zeedo		yeh, you could always remap the key to something else though :)
2005-02-13T08:15:00.000Z	zeedo		lol
2005-02-13T08:15:00.000Z	Slaven	snowblink	I have an old iCL here that I'm seriously considering using instead.
2005-02-13T08:15:00.000Z	Slaven		it has ctrl,alt,space,altgr,ctrl
2005-02-13T08:15:00.000Z	zeedo		I use the windows keys and menu keys on my machines for other functions
2005-02-13T08:16:00.000Z	zeedo		winkey opens a run prompt and menu key locks the desktop
2005-02-13T08:16:00.000Z	Slaven		yeah
2005-02-13T08:16:00.000Z	Slaven		but it could just as well have been called tellytubby-key and have a pic of a lala on it.
2005-02-13T08:16:00.000Z	Slaven		it's just stupid.
2005-02-13T08:17:00.000Z	zeedo	Slaven	its there to remind people that they could have had a crap OS but they chose ubuntu
