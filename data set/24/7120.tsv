2007-05-02T13:03:00.000Z	tom_		swarms: don't use itunes 7.
2007-05-02T13:03:00.000Z	tom_		swarms: apple messed around with a lot of stuff. you'll find better help in #banshee, talk to snorp.
2007-05-02T13:04:00.000Z	tom_		swarms: snorp does the ipod support for banshee, if he's around, he'll help you out.
2007-05-02T13:04:00.000Z	tom_		definitely better than vnc.
2007-05-02T13:05:00.000Z	tom_		banshee > exaile.
2007-05-02T13:06:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	thats your opinion, youre welcome to it
2007-05-02T13:06:00.000Z	tom_		hiddenhax: enable restricted drivers, or use ndiswrapper.
2007-05-02T13:06:00.000Z	tom_		lies bruenig
2007-05-02T13:07:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	youre also welcome to have all of those mono packages on your system
2007-05-02T13:07:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	he's already using banshee, the problem is his ipod was messed around with after using itunes7.
2007-05-02T13:08:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	i'm very close with the banshee project, i see it all the time.
2007-05-02T13:08:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	that doesnt mean its better :)
2007-05-02T13:08:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	i think he's already made that decision when he started using banshee in the first place.
2007-05-02T13:09:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	thats funny.  so youre saying he's closed minded?
2007-05-02T13:09:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	i'm saying hes trying to get his ipod to work with banshee.
2007-05-02T13:10:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	and the ipod works well with it most of the time.
2007-05-02T13:10:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	I only said "try" exaile.  It works perfect with ipods
2007-05-02T13:11:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	does it not use HAL to mount it? if the ipod isn't recognized by HAL, then exaile won't work with it either.
2007-05-02T13:11:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	its all good fun.. I like python apps, especially a music player that I can extend when I want
2007-05-02T13:12:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	you realize banshee is pluggable and also has a boo interface?
2007-05-02T13:13:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	havent check banshee in a couple of months, when I installed it, I thought it wasnt intuitive.  It should take me 10 mins to figure out how to import songs.  Exaile: Pick directory, bam.
2007-05-02T13:15:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	i think thats very difficult to believe because a) first run banshee opens a generic file dialogue to select your music directory, and b) because the import function is under the "music" title.
2007-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	concept10	tom_	when did they add that dialog?
2007-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	tom_	concept10	over 2 years ago.
