2005-12-04T14:42:00.000Z	polpak		from the GUI is there a way to unmount the cdrom drive?
2005-12-04T14:43:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	if you are using gnome, I like to add the mounted drives to a panel.  then you can just click on it and select unmount
2005-12-04T14:47:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	how to add mounted drives to panel?
2005-12-04T14:50:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	how to add mounted drives to panel so I can unmout them by right clicking?
2005-12-04T14:51:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	just right-click on an empty panel space and then click add to panel, there you will find a tool to do it
2005-12-04T15:07:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	argh
2005-12-04T15:07:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	whats wring buddy?
2005-12-04T15:07:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	I added the "disk mount utility" to the panel, but it also only has options to eject, not unmount a cdrom
2005-12-04T15:08:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	hmmm
2005-12-04T15:08:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop   lol
2005-12-04T15:08:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	just kidding

2005-12-04T15:08:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	hey man, thats how i roll
2005-12-04T15:19:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	any experience with K3b ?
2005-12-04T15:20:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	ask away!
2005-12-04T15:21:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	I'm trying to make a backup of my War3 FT cd (it's looking a little worn), but I can't burn an image that the SafeDisc or whatever protection is on it will work with
2005-12-04T15:22:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	that you might have to make an image with cdrecord on the command line
2005-12-04T15:22:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	any tips on how to use it?
2005-12-04T15:23:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	honestly i havent used cdrecord in a good deal of time, but i remember it having an excellent man page.
2005-12-04T15:24:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	yeah, reading it now, but there are a ton of options =p
2005-12-04T15:24:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	well, x-cdroast uses nothing but cdrecord as a backend, you can try that
2005-12-04T15:41:00.000Z	polpak	stevejesus	so it seems to use xcdroast I'll have to install some kernel modules to emulate scsi on my ATAPI cdrom
2005-12-04T15:43:00.000Z	stevejesus	polpak	dont worry it wont harm anything.  apt should take care of it?
