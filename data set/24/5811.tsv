2006-05-13T08:23:00.000Z	hajuu		is it just me, or in fluxbox, can you not resize windows? :/
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	hajuu		Can you remember how?
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	hajuu		I move my cursor to the edges, but I dont seem to be able to do anything
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	alt+right mousebutton should let you resize
2006-05-13T08:25:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	alt+left is for dragging.
2006-05-13T08:50:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	no not yet.
2006-05-13T08:51:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	tried killing gnome-panel?
2006-05-13T08:52:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-05-23T07:15:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	I installed oidentd
2006-05-23T07:16:00.000Z	hajuu	slackern	opened them in what? theres nothing to block them
2006-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	how could i know that? most people have some kind of router/firewall nowadays :)
2006-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	hajuu	slackern	because I said so, directly before you asking if I opened the port  :P
2006-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	oh sorry, didn't see it.
2006-05-23T07:20:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	thinking, how are you registered to the bots i mean what are they looking for? hajuu@host ?
2006-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	hmm do a 'man oidentd.conf' and check at the bottom there looks like you need to make a ~/.oident.conf file for how you should be identified.
2006-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	I know i did it before, but it was probably 4-5 years ago :)
2006-05-23T07:27:00.000Z	hajuu	slackern	hm cant quite see where I can specify another username to identify me as
2006-05-23T07:28:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	i'll paste it just a sec
2006-05-23T07:31:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14198 try that one
2006-05-23T07:31:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	maybe you need to do 'sudo /etc/init.d/oidentd restart' afterwards too
2006-05-23T07:34:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	still hajuu@host :)
2006-05-23T07:40:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	heh evil things ;)
2006-05-23T07:44:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	you saw that you can set the ident for which server you connect too
2006-05-23T07:46:00.000Z	slackern	hajuu	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14199 check that one out, maybe you can change some there.
