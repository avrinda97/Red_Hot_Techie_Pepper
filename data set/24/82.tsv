2012-08-09T20:23:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	drivers built-in to the Linux kernel are absolutely the best option, if they work for you.
2012-08-09T20:24:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	do you need 3D acceleration in Linux?
2012-08-09T20:25:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	"prefer" is not "need." i have an AMD APU. i'd prefer 3D. but it's not worth the hassle of fglrx over the kernel's "radeon" driver. for me.
2012-08-09T20:27:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	it's not a subject lending itself to quick discussion on IRC. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit
2012-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	stop installing that ATI driver you just downloaded.
2012-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	you are making a bad decision.
2012-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	zack6849	mneptok	DON'T install it? o_0
2012-08-09T20:38:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	yes. do NOT install that.
2012-08-09T20:40:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	it is not in any way tied to the Ubuntu package system. it is installed by you alone. you alone will need to maintain it. if you ever get a kernel upgrade, you will boot into the terminal, reconfigure the latest driver to match the latest kernel, enable the module, reboot, and check X configuration. you know how to do all that, right?
2012-08-09T20:40:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	then as i said, you do not NEED 3D acceleration.
2012-08-09T20:41:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	can you see a GUI?
2012-08-09T20:42:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	then *what do you need another driver for*?

2012-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	zack6849	mneptok	my video card isnt listed there
2012-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	start looking at the (already installed) program xrandr
2012-08-09T20:45:00.000Z	zack6849	mneptok	i cant find that program
2012-08-09T20:45:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	it is a command-line app
2012-08-09T20:46:00.000Z	zack6849	mneptok	i have absolutley no idea what im looking at
2012-08-09T20:48:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	graphics companies treat their work like state secrets. this is only now begininng to change. on Linux you are left with giant binary blobs that are almost unmaintaniable, or reverse-engineered work that assumes you know your way around a Unix command line.
2012-08-09T20:49:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	do a YouTube search for "linus torvalds nvidia" to see why this stuff doesn't "Just Work" in anything but closed, proprietary OSes.
2012-08-09T20:49:00.000Z	mneptok	zack6849	that video has NSFW language.
