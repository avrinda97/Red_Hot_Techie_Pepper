2010-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flypiper	also sometimes or a lot of the time actsaul other distros, work better for wireless than Ubuntu
2010-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	flypiper	sebsebseb	I understand that but my 14 year old daughter doesn't .. she likes Ubuntu
2010-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flypiper	as for 9.04 its a pretty great release really, shame it will go end of life at the end of October, no more security updates
2010-06-27T08:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	flypiper	well there was one end user feature that really got at me, but other then that :)
2010-06-27T08:19:00.000Z	flypiper	sebsebseb	 I understand building a CD that doesn't have the wireless working and NetworkManager shuts down the interfaces about every 20 seconds.. that's called a great Release
