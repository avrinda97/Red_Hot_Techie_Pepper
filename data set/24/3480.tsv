2012-02-27T21:46:00.000Z	cancer		Which is best of All kubuntu 11.10 or 10.4 LTS?
2012-02-27T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	there is no best
2012-02-27T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	i'd go for the latest. The newer kernel and drivers may help support hardware better
2012-02-27T21:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	both
2012-02-27T21:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	install 11.10 and you will be fine
2012-02-27T21:51:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	Thanks. that's what is called solution. :) Thanks to all.
2012-02-27T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	you can only upgrade 10.04 to 10.10 (next release) or 12.04 (LTS to LTS).
2012-02-27T21:59:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	where can i learn basic about linux (kubuntu)
2012-02-27T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	same place you learned windows
2012-02-27T22:00:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	i learned window by practicing from the time of Dos, win 3.1 and so on. but stoped on xp. i like command prompt and linux is full of it.
2012-02-27T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	same way then. You learned by using the OS, that's on of the greatest ways to learn Linux too
2012-02-27T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	you can use CLI in XP, it's called powersell
2012-02-27T22:01:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	but it seem bit confusing to me. maybe coz i have not tried it yet.
2012-02-27T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	indeed, just use the OS and you'll be ok
2012-02-28T15:57:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	hi, i have downloaded kubuntu 11.10. Now which is best to use virtualbox or wubi
2012-02-28T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	I'd go with virtualbox, I'm not a fan of wubi
2012-02-28T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	virtualbox can mount ISOs as is. Be sure you MD5 test it.
2012-02-28T16:01:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	i'm actually confused about virtual box. in wubi it installed my last ubuntu in seperate partition. that's the point virtualbox brings confusion.
2012-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	wubi installs ubuntu to a disk file which is then loop mounted at boot. Virtualbox install to a similar file but is accessed inside windows so yourun both OSes at the same time
2012-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	and what to do with md5?
2012-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	you should test the ISO you have to see if it is complete and consistant. MD5 testing does that
2012-02-28T16:04:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	ISO just downloaded. how to md5 test.
2012-02-29T20:45:00.000Z	cancer	ActionParsnip	Hi, i'm back after created VM. Now got a new problem. Cannot install kubuntu
2012-02-29T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cancer	ask the channel
