2007-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	jimmygoon		Is there any way to connect a windows app into ubuntu, like X forwarding with ssh
2007-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	jimmygoon		?
2007-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	that's how i'm talking to you right now :)
2007-06-18T12:13:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	how do you mean?
2007-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	I want the reverse. I want to use a windows app, under ubuntu
2007-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	make sure you have an ssh server set up on the linux box that can forward X11...then download Xming for windows...just do a google search for it
2007-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	then download putty, and make sure X11 forwarding is on and login to your server.  you can then run linux apps on your windows desktop
2007-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	I want the other way around
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	you're out of luck then it sounds like
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	gr, thats about what I expected, thanks
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	np man....sorry i couldn't help out.
2007-06-18T12:16:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	its ok, I appreciate it
2007-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	there IS a way to do it
2007-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	there is a way to do it
2007-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	how's that?
2007-06-18T13:00:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SeamlessVirtualization
2007-06-18T13:02:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	 ahh...i see.  that's pretty much the opposite of what i do for linux -> windows.  nice to learn something new, though.  thanks :)
2007-06-18T13:04:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	 it seems to be just a remote desktop session, though.  so not really virtualized...i would imagine all the processing is done on the host machine.
2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	yep but I can leave xp running in vmware server and it never gets in my way, always running, sure it takes up a few cycles, but its convient as all get out
2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	what program do you need to run that badly to do all that, out of curiosity
2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	visual studio 2005
2007-06-18T13:06:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	ahhh
2007-06-18T13:13:00.000Z	jimmygoon	pha|con	the irony of course is, part of the reason I wanted vs2005 was for the fonts/colors/ etc... and sure enough, the fonts are misrendered through terminal services :S
2007-06-18T13:16:00.000Z	pha|con	jimmygoon	 irony indeed.  xming does a good job of it for linux apps on windows desktops...everything looks native save the decorations.  otherwise it alls looks like what i'd see if i were in front of my pc at home
