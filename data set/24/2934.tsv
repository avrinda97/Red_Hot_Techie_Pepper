2008-06-20T08:51:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		i got a question how can i speedup my internet speed ?!?
2008-06-20T08:52:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		thanks and where can i get that
2008-06-20T08:53:00.000Z	Metatron^	Ne0_WizArd	what connection do you have?  obvious answer, buy more bandwith,  tweaking mtu can help sometimes, but is usually handled automatically correctly
2008-06-20T08:53:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		i have cable
2008-06-20T08:53:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		but am not sure about the speed
2008-06-20T08:53:00.000Z	Metatron^		if mtu is incorrect, fixing can have a significant effect.
2008-06-20T08:55:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		the thing is that i an upgrading to the newest version of ubuntu
2008-06-20T08:55:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		and it taking a long time
2008-06-20T08:56:00.000Z	Metatron^		im running ubuntu without gnome, i need a file search utility but cant seem to find one, suggestions? something other than cat or grep with a gui, and options a result as text would be great
2008-06-20T08:56:00.000Z	Metatron^		maybe i need to get rox-filer
2008-06-20T08:56:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		s_spiff> do u think it would be better
2008-06-20T08:56:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		thanks genii
2008-06-20T08:57:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		mm
2008-06-20T08:57:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		what would be best
2008-06-20T08:58:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		mmm
2008-06-20T08:58:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		the thing is that
2008-06-20T08:59:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		i updated my system today and after updating the system need a restart and i did after that my resolutiuon went all wrong why would that be
2008-06-20T08:59:00.000Z	Metatron^	Ne0_WizArd	the restricted vidoe driver might have gotten disabled
2008-06-20T08:59:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		i have already checked on that
2008-06-20T09:00:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		and it says that it is in use
2008-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd	s_spiff	i dont know how to do that
2008-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	Ne0_WizArd		yes
2008-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	Metatron^	Ne0_WizArd	open term and type xrandr, it will show the resolutions it thinks are avialable
