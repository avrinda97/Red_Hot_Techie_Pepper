2009-08-28T07:57:00.000Z	alanpan		how do we use ssh in terminal
2009-08-28T07:57:00.000Z	alanpan		trying to connect to my iphone
2009-08-28T07:57:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	ssh username@host -C
2009-08-28T07:59:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	compression
2009-08-28T07:59:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	you can "ssh --help" or "man ssh"
2009-08-28T08:01:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	you can connect to remote computers, forward ports (or services), and bring parts of the screen to your computer (such as certain programs)
2009-08-28T08:02:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	yes, with special software
2009-08-28T08:05:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	the ssh server software for windows does not have a GUI installer, but can let you forward GUI on the screen with Xming software installed
2009-08-28T08:05:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	yes, winscp: ftp transfers, ssh: ftp transfers + more
2009-08-28T08:08:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	no
2009-08-28T08:08:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	not true
2009-08-28T08:10:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	what you heard is it might go a little bit slower because of CPU usage on both sides and encryption (so no one can see the data transfered)
2009-08-28T08:10:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	its not a noticable difference in speed really
2009-08-28T08:11:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	not by default, but you can install it, it uses ssh as client and sshd as ssh server
2009-08-28T08:12:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	the GUI in putty is nice, you can try it in ubuntu if you like a GUI
2009-08-28T08:13:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	correct, you can install with "sudo apt-get install putty" in terminal
2009-08-28T08:15:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	is you dns working; try ssh username@sample.com -C
2009-08-28T08:15:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	do you have an ssh server to connect to?
2009-08-28T08:17:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	no, you can not forward a user manually through an ssh connection unless you vpn
2009-08-28T08:18:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	vpn = virtual private network, try wikipedia.org for lots of details
2009-08-28T08:22:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	alanpan, most modern routers do not allow terminal access, you can go through a web browser, such as w3m http://192.168.1.1
2009-08-28T08:22:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	or you could in terminal: firefox http://192.168.1.1
2009-08-28T09:04:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	try "man coreutils", does that give anything? (use man <program> for details of any program listed)
2009-08-28T09:08:00.000Z	linux	alanpan	correct
