2008-01-07T18:56:00.000Z	Lacrymology		my pretty graphics are gone!
2008-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	Lacrymology		no, really. I boot today and I get a message box saying "your graphics configuration could not be automatically detected, you have to configure them manually
2008-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	Lacrymology		so I do
2008-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	Lacrymology		and still I'm stuck at 800x600
2008-01-07T18:58:00.000Z	Lacrymology		anybody knows this issue?
2008-01-07T18:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-01-07T19:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	use pastebin for your xorg
2008-01-07T19:06:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	http://www.pastebin.com/d34f30c29
2008-01-07T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	empty?
2008-01-07T19:07:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	wait a second
2008-01-07T19:07:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	lose the "www"
2008-01-07T19:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	It is locked at 800x600?  Odd, I see nothing wrong in xorg...Did you manually enter monitor info?
2008-01-07T19:13:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	I can choose between 800x600 and 640x480, and I know it doesn't look bad to me either, I don't know
2008-01-07T19:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	For a test.  sudo dpkg again.. but select vesa as the video card and 1024 max...
2008-01-07T19:15:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	same
2008-01-07T19:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	no idea.. something odd is up.. are you running in vb or under wubi or something that is NOT a standard install?
2008-01-07T19:17:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	no
2008-01-07T19:18:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	everything was fine on friday, shut down, went home for the weekend. It's not working now
2008-01-07T19:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	Did you do any updates on firday or antyhing that might be a clue?
2008-01-07T19:22:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	I don't think so, no. I'm changing back to nv instead of nvidia, just for a check
2008-02-08T19:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	I thought you were given the answer..... but didnt like it...
2008-02-08T19:18:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	Having a chroot is not working on the same environment. If I get a plain "no" for this, I'll backup /home and reinstall
2008-02-08T19:19:00.000Z	Lacrymology	Jack_Sparrow	and I got a plain "no" from a debian forum, so I'll just do that later on
2008-02-08T19:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lacrymology	Most people that ask that question just want them to run...
