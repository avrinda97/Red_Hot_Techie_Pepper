2006-11-13T10:09:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I still get error when typing startx: no screens found
2006-11-13T10:09:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I did apt-get install xserver-xorg ubuntu-desktop, but X wont start
2006-11-13T10:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	needhelp	then your xorg.conf is not set up properly. as a quick fix, revert to vesa driver
2006-11-13T10:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	needhelp	could alsobe you dont have the proper driver installed
2006-11-13T10:10:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	well, it worked just fine before I tried to install my new mouse....
2006-11-13T10:11:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I tried to change xorg.conf to install the new cordless mouse
2006-11-13T10:15:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	needhelp	as i said, try reverting to vesa, and then get your drivers set up properly
2006-11-13T10:15:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I tried to select VESA manually, but still same result...
2006-11-13T10:15:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	needhelp	does the screen section of xorg.conf look ok?
2006-11-13T10:15:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I did select vesa with dpkg-reconfigure
2006-11-13T10:16:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	I havent change the screensection of xorg.conf at all. And it worked ok 2 hours ago
2006-11-13T10:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	needhelp	you have, as you ran dpkg-reconfigure...
2006-11-13T10:17:00.000Z	needhelp	nolimitsoya	ok, anything special I should look for in xorg.conf then?
