2009-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	matreya6	lenswipe	I'm not familiar with Samba configuration, but comma's without spaces generally mean empty fields in a configuration file. They are quite common. just take a look at /etc/passwd
2009-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	not sure what you mean...
2009-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	empty feilds in a configuration file?
2009-05-18T01:14:00.000Z	matreya6	lenswipe	yes. Just look at /etc/passwd for an example. Human users generally have a home directory. Users made for servers have none because they do not login to the system, so the field normally used for home directory is empty, showing as (...,,...)
2009-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	no but what im talking about is the username on the start menu
2009-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	instaed of it saying "John Smith" it says "John Smith,,,,,,"
2009-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	like that
2009-05-18T01:15:00.000Z	matreya6	lenswipe	sorry, can't help you with that since I'm not familiar with Samba config.
2009-05-18T01:16:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	thanks anyway
2009-05-18T01:17:00.000Z	matreya6	lenswipe	I would be suprised if there was no dedicated channel to samba, probably called #samba, best try your luck there
2009-05-18T01:17:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	there is (#samba) problem is, ive been posting in there since maybe about 2:00 uk time and its now 21:17 uk time
2009-05-18T01:18:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	there is literally nobody there at all
2009-05-18T01:18:00.000Z	lenswipe	matreya6	loads of people logged into the channel, just the channel is 100% dead and has been all afternoon
2009-05-18T01:18:00.000Z	matreya6	lenswipe	that can be a problem with some dedicated channels, yes...
