2007-02-15T08:12:00.000Z	Slart		anyone know of a nice, fairly recent summary of filesystems for linux?
2007-02-15T08:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	it's here --->  "use ext3"
2007-02-15T08:13:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	hehe.. thanks for that little summary.. I'm already wrong in using reiser on my boot partition then? =)
2007-02-15T08:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	add an entry in /etc/fstab
2007-02-15T08:19:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	last time I did this (using fstab), people said I should have used sometihng else.. unfortunately I forgot what I was supposed to use instead
2007-02-15T08:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	they mention UUIDs ?
2007-02-15T08:21:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	nope.. I use that for some of my drives.. it was something else.. an alternative to editing fstab by hand
2007-02-15T08:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	is this a usb drive ?
2007-02-15T08:22:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	nope... a regular sata harddrive, ext3
2007-02-15T08:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	k, stick it in /etc/fstab & have done
2007-02-15T08:23:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	ok, done that.. just wondering what this other, apparently oh so great, way of mounting stuff was
2007-02-15T08:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	I'm curious too
2007-02-15T08:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	sudo mount -a   & done
2007-02-15T08:24:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	yup.. done that.. but it still doesn't show up in nautilus.. I have to reboot or something stupid windows-like for that to happen?
2007-02-15T08:24:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	I mean.. it shows up in /media/sdb1.. but not in the places panel
2007-02-15T08:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	dude, what's it doing in /media ? that's for removable devices
2007-02-15T08:26:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	that's where ubuntu put all my hard drives on install
2007-02-15T08:26:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	removable or not
2007-02-15T08:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	how odd
2007-02-15T08:33:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	indeed what I thought.. but I just figured it was the ubuntu way of doing things .. it's done no harm so far that I know of
2008-06-23T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	because we feel just a little bit better than the 32-bit mob ;)
2008-06-23T16:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Slart	if only it were true..
2008-06-23T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	Frogzoo	one can dream =)
