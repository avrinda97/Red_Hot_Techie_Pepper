2009-11-14T17:01:00.000Z	Clay1		HM it seems my graphics card wasn't enabled, let me see if i can enable it and see if it works. Tell you ina  min
2009-11-14T17:04:00.000Z	Clay1	legend2440	thanks for the driver graphic insight while it downloads and installs though maybe you could help me with this other issue? MY microphone isn't working on unbuntu but perfectly fine on windows. Ive checked for common mistakes like being mutated and whatnot but it seems to simply not recognize a microphone exists. I know its a broad margin for error but maybe you could help me here.
2009-11-14T17:06:00.000Z	Clay1		i am stratus
2009-11-14T17:06:00.000Z	Clay1		HOwever legend just i think helped me out.
2009-11-14T17:06:00.000Z	Clay1		Basically it wont let me use any 3d or high graphics.
2009-11-14T17:07:00.000Z	Clay1		And i was pretty sure it was because of drivers. GO to systems>administration>hardware drivers. And see if it gives you the option to activate your graphics driver.
