2005-04-29T11:30:00.000Z	Reblended		anyone here use a laptop? and anyone have problems with "panel fitting" or AKA "digital scaling"? I just saw there was a fix for the sony vaio with a hotkey for xp, but I wonder if I can use this fix with Ubuntu somehow? (could this question be related to making the special keys for laptops work with ubuntu?)

2005-04-29T11:31:00.000Z	Scuddie	Reblended	 Did you set your smoothing to monocolor?
2005-04-29T11:32:00.000Z	Scuddie		esd=?
2005-04-29T11:32:00.000Z	Scuddie		I can't use OSS?
2005-04-29T11:32:00.000Z	Reblended	Scuddie	not yet, I'm just seeing if there is a fix or if I have to worry about it.. I'm hoping to get xserver to run soon
2005-04-29T11:32:00.000Z	Reblended	Scuddie	pci setting for my card, an intel 82815, is what I need, I think?
2005-04-29T11:33:00.000Z	Scuddie		Oh...  Well, I don't know anything about intel video chipsets.
2005-04-29T11:34:00.000Z	Reblended		well, they're peanuts,
2005-04-29T11:34:00.000Z	Reblended		I found out too late
2005-04-29T11:34:00.000Z	Scuddie		But once you install, you'll need to disable smoothing or set smoothing to monocolor if you want to read anything.
2005-04-29T11:35:00.000Z	Reblended	Scuddie	thx for the tip.. and would that be a setting found under desktop...?
2005-04-29T11:35:00.000Z	Scuddie		system->preferences->fonts
2005-04-29T11:35:00.000Z	Reblended	Scuddie	when running the live cd on an HP laptop it looked pretty good
2005-04-29T11:36:00.000Z	Reblended		the only thing that I didn't get working was the special keys on the laptop... like volume, etc
2005-04-29T11:36:00.000Z	Scuddie		You weren't looking at white text over black.
2005-04-29T11:36:00.000Z	Reblended		ahh
2005-04-29T11:36:00.000Z	Scuddie		And that messes up smoothed text like nobody's business.
2005-04-29T11:36:00.000Z	Reblended		ok
2005-04-29T11:37:00.000Z	Reblended		how strange
2005-04-29T11:37:00.000Z	Scuddie		I know.  I wouldn't have guessed either.
2005-04-29T11:37:00.000Z	Scuddie		It was only by accident that I figured it out.
2005-04-29T11:37:00.000Z	Reblended		happens, nice huh?
2005-04-29T11:38:00.000Z	Reblended	Scuddie	so, what kind of laptop? or is this just a desktop with lcd?
