2009-03-19T05:30:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	as with all debian library packages, libBLA is the actual compiled library used by depending programs, libBLA-dev is the source headers you NEED to compile stuff against it, and libBLA-bin is auxiliary executables to go with it.
2009-03-19T05:31:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	do i need bin
2009-03-19T05:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	unlikely.
2009-03-19T05:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	manual inst is something ex-windows users think they need to do
2009-03-19T05:33:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	why do they think they need to do that
2009-03-19T05:33:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	because that is what they are used to doing
2009-03-19T05:34:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	is there any value in it... honestly?
2009-03-19T05:34:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	no
2009-03-19T05:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	but you can do it all within synaptic...
2009-03-19T05:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	if you know what you need to do you can do it quicker with apt-get/aptitude command line
2009-03-19T05:36:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	thanks
2009-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	no, just backport the deb
2009-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	;)
2009-03-19T05:38:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	you basically just get the source PACKAGE for e.g. jaunty 9.04 (not the original .tar.gz) and rebuild it for 8.10
2009-03-19T05:38:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	most of the time it works fine
2009-03-19T05:38:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	and you can then just deploy that .deb file
2009-03-19T05:39:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	but WHY?
2009-03-19T05:39:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	it's less work, actually.
2009-03-19T05:40:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	you said: libcoin60 is in 9.04, but... are y ou suggesting i do with it what you just said?
2009-03-19T05:41:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	if you are going to be developing, i recommend you consider just using 9.04
2009-03-19T05:44:00.000Z	alex-weej	AnyaJ	prevu looks like a piece of cake
2009-03-19T06:00:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	you still around?
2009-03-19T06:21:00.000Z	AnyaJ	alex-weej	another thing the repositories does is lump programs that are "dependent" upon each other when they arne't necessarily so
