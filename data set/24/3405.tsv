2009-03-10T00:20:00.000Z	benste	red-lichtie	I already looked up those bug reports, but didn't find anything interesting
2009-03-10T00:22:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	Open Synaptics, "mark for complete removal", apply, reinstall and "rm -rf ~/.mozilla", then you should have a new and naked firefox installation

2009-03-10T00:39:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	What are you getting from a terminal start now, the same message ?
2009-03-10T00:41:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	What version of xul-runner do you have ?
2009-03-10T00:42:00.000Z	benste	red-lichtie	I think it's 1.9
2009-03-10T00:43:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	Synaptics -> "Quick search:" = "xul"
2009-03-10T00:44:00.000Z	benste	red-lichtie	1.9.0.7

2009-03-10T00:49:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	Just for the hell of it, try creating a new user (testmoz) or something, logon to that user to split the difference between a user dependant error or a general firefox error
2009-03-10T00:55:00.000Z	benste	red-lichtie	- didn't work
2009-03-10T00:57:00.000Z	red-lichtie	benste	Your best bet might be Server: irc.mozilla.org Channel: #firefox then
2009-03-10T00:59:00.000Z	benste	red-lichtie	I may do so later on, but I spended more than 6 h on this problem now, I'll reintall the machine tomorrow, thanks for you help
