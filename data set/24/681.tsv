2011-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	b1lly		the file permissions of my var/www/homeskoold/gelberg folder
2011-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	b1lly		are not set, so i cant access the files in that folder via my web url
2011-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	b1lly		im trying to set them to "read"
2011-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	do a "ls -la" and paste one of the resulting lines
2011-03-28T08:08:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	most likely the files are not owned by www-data or your isp is blocking port 80
2011-03-28T08:09:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	my files are owned by root?
2011-03-28T08:09:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	yep.. not what you want.. sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/*
2011-03-28T08:10:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	whats the reason for this
2011-03-28T08:10:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	www-data is the standard owner of apache's files in /var/www ..
2011-03-28T08:11:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	you as "manipulator" of the files should be in the www-data group
2011-03-28T08:13:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	protected files all have a specific owner.. your stuff is owned by you.. system files are owned by root.. web served files are owned by www-data.. after that you also deal with permissions on those files.. read only, read+write, read_write+execute for three levels.. owner, group and everyone.
2011-03-28T08:13:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	chown=change owner
2011-03-28T08:14:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	when i setup ftp accounts, do i just set folder ownership to the same as the ftp username
2011-03-28T08:15:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	ftp setup is a little more tricky.. depend on if you want each user confined to their own /home folder or make it universal.. I'm not good at setting up ftp.
2011-03-28T08:16:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	now that i set the ownership to www-data
2011-03-28T08:17:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	yes and no.. yes because security for apache is handled by apache if the files are owned by the apache user group.. www-data..
2011-03-28T08:18:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	no because if the files in /var/www are not owned by www-data then apache has no rights to present the files to "the world"..
2011-03-28T08:18:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	when i did www-data:www-data         , is that like a username:password? or is that admin:group
2011-03-28T08:19:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	that's a user:group
2011-03-28T08:24:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	you could do that too.. as long as the second name is www-data
2011-03-29T08:52:00.000Z	izinucs	b1lly	probably because that machine's user doesn't have a user on the ftp machine and/or that user isn't listed in the database of users for the FTP
2011-03-29T08:54:00.000Z	b1lly	izinucs	any suggestion?
