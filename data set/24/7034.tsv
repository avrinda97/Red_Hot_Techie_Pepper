2005-05-22T10:04:00.000Z	brokenladder		but intel makes their own mb's, many of which are much better than amd setups.
2005-05-22T10:04:00.000Z	brokenladder		in my case, the equivalent amd mb would not have been as good.
2005-05-22T10:04:00.000Z	brokenladder		also, amd will not have the fab capacity to keep up with intel on the dual core home market.
2005-05-22T10:04:00.000Z	brokenladder		no, there are actually features it didn't have
2005-05-22T10:05:00.000Z	brokenladder		i forgot the details, but i researched it before buying.
