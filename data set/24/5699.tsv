2006-05-24T06:31:00.000Z	jonuk		I don't know if you all are familiar with my former problem, but I have 2 hard drives.  The other one is a 40GB drive with Windows on it.  I had to unplug the drive for the Ubuntu installation to work
2006-05-24T06:32:00.000Z	jonuk		I'd like to know how to set up Grub so that I can dual boot once I plug my other hard drive with Windows back in
2006-05-24T06:33:00.000Z	jonuk		Arrick...no, I waited like 20 minutes...and it never popped up
2006-05-24T06:34:00.000Z	jonuk		and when I hit Ctrl+C, it started to reload the partitioner then hangs at 52% everytime
2006-05-24T06:36:00.000Z	jonuk		unto, I really appreciate your help
2006-05-24T06:36:00.000Z	jonuk		can anyone help me get the dual-boot set up now though?

2006-05-24T06:40:00.000Z	jonuk		I will look there, but for now I would like to ask your help here
2006-05-24T06:42:00.000Z	jonuk		I had to unplug my other hard drive with Windows on it in order to install Ubuntu, how can I set up GRUB now so that I can dual boot
2006-05-24T06:42:00.000Z	jonuk		!grub
2006-05-24T06:43:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	prepending '!' sends to the bot
2006-05-24T07:12:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	where are you going to plug it in? which drive on which controller?
2006-05-24T07:15:00.000Z	jonuk	amphi	I have IDE drives
2006-05-24T07:16:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	if you move the ubuntu disk around, you will have to fix grub and /etc/fstab for it to boot properly
2006-05-24T07:21:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	I think you should read the info pages for grub first - pinfo is a more amiable info page browser
2006-05-24T07:21:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	although broken in other ways, which don't affect the grub pages
2006-05-24T07:28:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	you could use gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-05-24T07:29:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	be careful, you may make your system unbootable if you make a mistake; the grub docs are worth reading first IMHO
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	you can mess with this stuff from the grub shell
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	jonuk	amphi	how do i get to the grub shell
2006-05-24T07:44:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	at boot time
2006-05-27T16:46:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	cfdisk is pretty easy
2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	amphi	jonuk	cfdisk, yes
