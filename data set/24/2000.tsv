2009-08-28T13:51:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	try packages.ubuntu.com
2009-10-29T10:56:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	today
2010-01-27T14:24:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	no one i guess
2010-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	ah ok, fair enough, don't use it much anyway
2010-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	thats why they have the ubuntu logo near a package
2010-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	to say its officially supported
2010-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	so indus well then it's in restricted, right?
2010-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	its not uncontrolled,
2010-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	its tested by community members
2010-01-27T14:27:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	does it take much programming fu-ya to package a package
2010-01-27T14:28:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	no, and now its even easier with launchpad which auto builds a package from source if you follow steps
2010-01-27T14:31:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	so it compiles it and spits it out as a deb
2010-01-27T14:32:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	guess so
2010-01-27T14:32:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	do you want to build a package?
2010-01-27T14:37:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	yeah, something small
2010-01-27T14:46:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	are you looking for help for packaging? then https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete
2010-01-27T14:47:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	but i suggest just using launchpad
2010-01-27T14:48:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	ah ok, my main machine is on ubuntu 10.04, do i need to be on a linux machine to do it
2010-01-27T14:48:00.000Z	sagaci	indus	ty for the link thoug
2010-01-27T14:48:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	yes
2010-01-27T14:48:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	i dont know of anything in windows for this
2010-01-27T14:49:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	after all, you are making a linux package :)
2010-01-27T14:49:00.000Z	indus	sagaci	what language have you used for the program
