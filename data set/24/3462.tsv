2011-01-09T00:09:00.000Z	rtdos		is there a list of other window managers available for ubuntu rather than just xfce, gnome, or kde ?
2011-01-09T00:09:00.000Z	rtdos		does lubuntu use openbox, magicianlord?
2011-01-09T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	it uses openbox as the WM and LXDE as the DE
2011-01-09T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	xfce4 isnt a WM, nor is gnome or kde
2011-01-09T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	kde is a desktop and uses KWIN as its WM
2011-01-09T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	(K) (D)esktop (E)nvironment   0 massive clue
2011-01-09T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=764060    if you search software centre stuff will come up
2011-02-05T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	you can grab the debs and use dpkg but you will need to manually satisfy deps which apt-get does for you
2012-09-10T21:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	sudo crontab -e
2012-09-10T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	add the line:   0 0 * * * shutdown -h now
2012-09-10T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	the sudo crontab -e     will cron as root (needed for shutdown), the next bit I gave was to be added to the file. When you exit the editor the cron will be added

2012-09-10T21:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	its not a good idea, it removes a LOT of security in your OS
2012-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	just cron as root, no need to mess with sudoers
2012-09-11T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	sudo crontab -e     will do it
2012-09-11T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	sudo crontab -e
2012-09-11T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	or if you have a desktop UI:  gksudo gnome-schedule

2012-09-19T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	all I did was search, look at ALL that I found.....
2012-09-19T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	you could've done exactly the same....
2012-09-19T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtdos	its much better if you do a little work, then come here when you come up blank
