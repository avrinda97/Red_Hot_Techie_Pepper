2005-09-13T08:38:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	it should already be working.. what are you trying to do?
2005-09-13T08:39:00.000Z	pepsi	tga	get it to start when i bootup

2005-09-13T08:39:00.000Z	tga		doesn't inetd start by default?

2005-09-13T08:40:00.000Z	pepsi	tga	i installed the ident2 package because i couldnt figure out how else to make it work, but i have to start ident2 by hand each time i startup
2005-09-13T08:40:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	are you sure identd doesn't already start at bootup?
2005-09-13T08:40:00.000Z	pepsi		yes
2005-09-13T08:40:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	ps aux |grep inetd
2005-09-13T08:40:00.000Z	pepsi	tga	nothing
2005-09-13T08:41:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	I'm thinking maybe your /etc/inetd.conf is bad or something
2005-09-13T08:42:00.000Z	pepsi	tga	inetd doesnt exist
2005-09-13T08:42:00.000Z	pepsi		shouldnt it be in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin?
2005-09-13T08:42:00.000Z	tga		/usr/sbin/inetd
2005-09-13T08:43:00.000Z	tga		the pool table ate your java
2005-09-13T08:43:00.000Z	pepsi		tga,... right... doesnt exist... im using breezy btw :)
2005-09-13T08:43:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	do you have an xinetd?
2005-09-13T08:43:00.000Z	pepsi		no i dont
2005-09-13T08:43:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	in any case, to make something start at bootup you use update-rc.d
2005-09-13T08:44:00.000Z	pepsi		ok
2005-09-13T08:44:00.000Z	tga	pepsi	update-rc.d inetd defaults
