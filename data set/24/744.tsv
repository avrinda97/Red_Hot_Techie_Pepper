2011-02-09T00:15:00.000Z	abcdub		how to copy partition or files/folders to an external disk using testdisk? (partiton is visible only in testdisk)
2011-02-09T00:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	If you allow testdisk to write the new partition table to disk you should be able to mount the partition normally.
2011-02-09T00:19:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	I wrote the partition table but it brings all the NTFS partitons that I deleted without any damage but it doesn't show the Ext4 partition which was unallocated by Win7 and then I mistaknely changed it to Ext2.
2011-02-09T00:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	I don't understand what you mean by "but it doesn't show the Ext4 partition which was unallocated by Win7 and then I mistaknely changed it to Ext2." If testdisk can access the files, then you should be able to access those same files after testdisk has written the fixed partition table to disk. Are you sure you wrote the partition table *after* doing the deeper search?
2011-02-09T00:23:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	That's what I did. Okay I will do it again and will post results at pastebin. Is that fine?
2011-02-09T00:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	Yes. Please also pastebin the output of "sudo blkid" after writing the partition table.
2011-02-09T00:32:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/9cceX0qN after clicking analyze for the first time the 5 Linux is my partition that I discovered using TestDisk last time. But once I click "Quick Search" that partition is not there http://pastebin.com/g4RwJM8X . Should I proceed?
2011-02-09T00:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	Do the deeper search. BTW, I haven't seen a disk that actually uses C/H/S in ages :)
2011-02-09T00:40:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Sorry but didn't get the C/H/S part. Don't understand most of it :(
2011-02-09T00:40:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Deeper Search is going on BTW..
2011-02-09T00:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	Don't worry, it's not really important. Just means it's (probably) a fairly old disk.
2011-02-09T00:57:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Hey.. LiveVD crashed so I rebooted. But I can see that partition now. It mounts. The label sm random string. Now the first thing I want to do it copy this partiton to directory in another disk.
2011-02-09T01:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	An image of the partition, or just all of the files.
2011-02-09T01:02:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Which is the best way to recreate the partiton in case of damage and also access files..
2011-02-09T01:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	How much free space do you have on the drive you're backing up to?
2011-02-09T01:03:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Besides there's also one Windwos 7 partition. I need to dual boot so a backup will be handy. PS. You asked me to run a command after writing partiton table. What was that?
2011-02-09T01:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	"sudo blkid"
2011-02-09T01:04:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	I've two ext HDDs on one 47GB and on another 60 GB
2011-02-09T01:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	And how large is the partition you are backing up?
2011-02-09T01:05:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Shit..my system is again not responding, except for this webchat.freenode textbox
2011-02-09T01:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abcdub	Just so that you don't pull the plug...
2011-02-09T01:09:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	back to normal.just patience :-).. "sudo blkid" : http://pastebin.com/b3MAb6Xv
2011-02-09T01:19:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	'sudo blkid' : http://pastebin.com/b3MAb6Xv
2011-02-09T01:31:00.000Z	abcdub	Jordan_U	Using PartImage. no compression. hope it works.
