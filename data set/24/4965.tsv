2006-12-21T14:50:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	keyboard mode?
2006-12-21T14:51:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	I mean the character set and keyboard mode in /etc/default/console-setup, perhaps your existing apps messed it up.
2006-12-21T14:51:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Did it happen when you were in console ?
2006-12-21T14:51:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	it happens in vi, pico, gedit, bash, firefox, and gaim
2006-12-21T14:52:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Did it happen if you boot straight to console, not starting X ?
2006-12-21T14:52:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	i just found an extraneous section in xorg.conf that i forgot to remove. be right back, restarting x
2006-12-21T14:52:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	let me check
2006-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	getting rid of that extra section didn't work. should i stop x or will doing it in ctrl-alt-f1 work?
2006-12-21T14:54:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Sure, but you should probably try to shutdown X completely, or reboot without starting X. Do you happen to know that already ?
2006-12-21T14:54:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Just guessing, X might be the cause.
2006-12-21T14:54:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	/etc/init.d/gdm stop?
2006-12-21T14:55:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Yes
2006-12-21T14:56:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	no, it doesn't happen there
2006-12-21T14:56:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	My last guess, check if System-->Preferences-->Keyboard to see if the locale was rightly set to US (?)
2006-12-21T14:57:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Or else you should try to reinstall GNOME/X if that doesn't ehlp.
2006-12-21T14:58:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	It seems to be lacking some important fields.
2006-12-21T14:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	like?
2006-12-21T14:59:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	I would post mine if that doesn't fix it, but try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver' first, that faster.
2006-12-21T14:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	i don't want to screw up my nvidia config...
2006-12-21T15:00:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	Just back it up... ok, here's the relevant info:
2006-12-21T15:00:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	xserver-corg, sorry.
2006-12-21T15:00:00.000Z	fnf	Pie-rate	xserver-xorg.
2006-12-21T15:10:00.000Z	Pie-rate	fnf	nope. didn't do anything
