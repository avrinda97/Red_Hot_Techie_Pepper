2012-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	myrmidette|n1		can anyone post their /etc/host* files? I accidentally deleted mine
2012-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	an empty hosts file could work.
2012-05-11T14:08:00.000Z	myrmidette|n1	no_gravity	it doesn't :(
2012-05-11T14:08:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	*what* does not work?
2012-05-11T14:09:00.000Z	myrmidette|n1	no_gravity	my internet :(
2012-05-11T14:10:00.000Z	myrmidette|n1	no_gravity	it can reach the router fine but not the internet. All the other computers on the network work normally
2012-05-11T14:11:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	try to access 209.85.148.139 in your browser. what happens?
2012-05-11T14:12:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	yes, on that computer
2012-05-11T14:13:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	did you mean me with "Damn it does work"?
2012-05-11T14:14:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	if so, then it shows you that you can access the internet. probably your dns settings are wrong. how do you connect to the router?
2012-05-11T14:17:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	you provide wlan via your phone? what kind of phone? can your phone access websites? try browsing with your phone to a website you have not been to before.
2012-05-11T14:18:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	are you talking to me?
2012-05-11T14:19:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	then what about my questions?
2012-05-11T14:21:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	and you connect to it via the Network-Manager-Applet?
2012-05-11T14:22:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	dns settings are set to automatic?
2012-05-11T14:24:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	whats in /etc/resolv.conf ?
2012-05-11T14:25:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	what do you mean?
2012-05-11T14:26:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	how do you try to open it?
2012-05-11T14:27:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	as root?
2012-05-11T14:27:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	sounds like thats the problem. i/o error... hmm... i never had that.
2012-05-11T14:28:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	i would try to delete /etc/resolv.conf and reconnect to the phone.
2012-05-11T14:28:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	and see if a healthy resolv.conf gets created.
2012-05-11T14:32:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	google says do this: shutdown -r -F now
2012-05-11T14:33:00.000Z	no_gravity	myrmidette|n1	as seen here: http://superuser.com/questions/111625/i-o-error-on-linux-cannot-remove-directory-as-root
