2006-05-27T16:02:00.000Z	Michael`123		hehe :P
2006-05-27T16:02:00.000Z	Michael`123		Ah, really?
2006-05-27T16:03:00.000Z	Michael`123		Nice, nice. In a suburb of the Twin Cities myself.
2006-05-27T16:04:00.000Z	Michael`123		Anyway, I was wondering -- I installed Ubuntu, I opted to install GRUB, and yet it doesn't seem to install. No errors, nothing. I tried "sudo grub-install /dev/sda" with a Live CD and it did not work. I quoted a ton of things in this forum thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1037174#post1037174 -- Any ideas?
2006-05-27T16:06:00.000Z	Michael`123		I have asked in here about 4 or 5 times in the last few days, haven't really gotten any help =\
2006-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	on that screen is wher eyou would choose where grub was to be placed
2006-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	rebooting should now give you a grub menu
2006-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	I have rebooted like 10 times since installing
2006-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	and I have reinstalled Ubuntu about 3 times, and ran grub-install, as well as that config-grub command or whatever it is
2006-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	what if you hit the esc key when grub is supposed to appear
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	Tried that, but I checked with LiveCD and the grub menu.lst file does not even exist
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	hmmmmmmmm
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	and ubuntu was installed after xp?
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	I don't know if I am allowed to refer to it, but I did post on the Ubuntu Forums and I posted a ton of extra information and config files, etc: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1037174#post1037174
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	Correct
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	im half attempted to say try installing ubuntu again and place grub on mbr
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	As noted, I have tried reinstalling Ubuntu to make sure I didn't miss something 3 times, but to no avail. All it says is "Ubuntu detected another operating system: Windows XP......Would you like to install GRUB to the MBR?" (Yes or no), and every time I select YES
2006-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	It is off the disk that you can get Ubuntu to mail you
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	that doesnt mean that the md5sum is good
2006-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	But what are the chances of Ubuntu mailing out thousands of invalid distros?
2006-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	out of ten only 3 worked
2006-05-27T16:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	please dont paste in here
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Michael`123	gnomefreak	Been to the first link, second isn't really relevant, the third might be helpful
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Michael`123	it wont burn right at a high speed safest to go with lowest
