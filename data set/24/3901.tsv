2008-05-07T21:37:00.000Z	GregVernon		Interesting problem....
2008-05-07T21:37:00.000Z	GregVernon		Pidgin can connect to the internet, but seemingly nothing else can
2008-05-07T21:38:00.000Z	GregVernon		Firefox, the little weather applet, add/remove apps... nothing...
2008-05-07T21:38:00.000Z	GregVernon		yet I can IRC...
2008-05-07T21:38:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	did you set up a proxy in gnome perhaps
2008-05-07T21:41:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	restarting network may clear things up as well
2008-05-07T21:44:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	did u restart network
2008-05-07T21:45:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	not yet.  I'll do that now.  I've been hesitant to restart the network since that will take everything down
2008-05-07T21:45:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	? it should not hurt anything...
2008-05-07T21:50:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	no difference after a restarted network
2008-05-07T21:50:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	what exactly cannot access internet
2008-05-07T21:51:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	it seems like everything except Pidgin
2008-05-07T21:51:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	and u r sure pidgin is not just timing out connecting to msn or something
2008-05-07T21:51:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	I'm on Pidgin right now....
2008-05-07T21:52:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	i personally would try a full reboot
2008-05-07T21:52:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	well I have before... Last night I was experiencing the same problem, shut the PC down etc.
2008-05-07T22:05:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	check FF network settings, check all your network settings, DNS, route, etc
2008-05-07T22:06:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	I have... I haven't changed any settings... this is a *clean* install
2008-05-07T22:07:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	*something* has been changed or is wrong evidently
2008-05-07T22:07:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	yes, something is wrong, but I can't imagine what...
2008-05-07T22:08:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	as i said, network settings in FF, in network settings in gnome, etc
2008-05-07T22:09:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	points to a router issue perhaps
2008-05-07T22:10:00.000Z	GregVernon	ejer	maybe.  But if I boot into windows things seem to work...
2008-05-07T22:12:00.000Z	ejer	GregVernon	u r trying to logically fix an issue without knowing the variables :) Go make sure settings are ok... set it to known working settings (static ip), then move to where u want to be one step at a time
