2004-11-04T08:06:00.000Z	theine		Is there something like a development branch for Ubuntu and if so, what is the apt-repository called?
2004-11-04T08:07:00.000Z	theine		Looking at http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/ there already seems to be hoary
2004-11-04T08:07:00.000Z	bob2	theine	it's empty
2004-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	bob2	theine	you can put them on hold
2004-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	theine	bob2	that's exactly what i want to do, but how?
2004-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	bob2	theine	I'm sure synaptic has an option somewhere...
2004-12-12T17:55:00.000Z	theine	bob2	After taken a closer look I saw it does, most intuitively it's called ``lock version''... Thanks
2004-12-12T11:00:00.000Z	bob2	theine	ubuntu has more modules, yeah
2004-12-12T11:00:00.000Z	theine	bob2	alright, thanks
2004-12-14T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	theine	on hoary?
2004-12-14T11:30:00.000Z	theine	bob2	yes
2004-12-14T11:30:00.000Z	bob2	theine	ipw2200?
2004-12-14T11:31:00.000Z	theine	bob2	close, ipw2100
2004-12-14T11:34:00.000Z	theine	bob2	what works for thombot?
2004-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	theine	from umount?
2004-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	theine	bob2	exactly
2004-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	theine	known bug, it's in the bts
2004-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	theine	bob2	any workarounds?
2004-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	theine	don't think so
2004-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	theine	bob2	and are there any news with the empty /proc directory issue?
2004-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	theine	seems to be related but I aoin't heard anything yet
2004-12-16T07:09:00.000Z	theine	bob2	good to hear that those two might be resolved in one go
2005-04-20T11:44:00.000Z	theine	bob2	but under very heavy load i guess...
2005-04-23T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	theine	it could be if someone packaged it and the licenese allowed it to be distributed
