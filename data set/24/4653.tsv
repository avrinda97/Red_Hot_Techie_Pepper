2007-03-06T06:14:00.000Z	rylan		ok, i just installed a pluggin for gaim. and restarted gaim. nothing happened. do i need to restart or did some magical "anti-rylan" particle hit my computer and made it so that nothing is going to work
2007-03-06T06:15:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	is the plugin in Tools/Plugins?
2007-03-06T06:16:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	is it from the repo?
2007-03-06T06:16:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	sorry no it is now
2007-03-06T06:17:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	did you check if the plugin installed into the correct location? like checking the files the repo packages provide and looking for plugin files there?
2007-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	looks like everything installed properly. i wasnt given an option for where to install it.
2007-03-06T06:20:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	looks like for me, gaim plugins are located in /usr/lib64/gaim (I am not using an Ubuntu package though). You can check the location in synaptic with properties/installed files.
2007-03-06T06:20:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	did you try running gaim in the console to see if it shows error messages? But I actually do not know if it would.
2007-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	and no it shows no error messages
2007-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	did you locate the plugin in that gaim directory?
2007-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	working on that. girlfriend is litterally lying on me
2007-03-06T06:23:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	i found something to do with it in usr/share/gaim
2007-03-06T06:25:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	hm I've got no /usr/share/gaim. But that can be me. (not an Ubuntu package). So if there is other gaim stuff there it should be ok, if not, then the plugin instlaled into the wrong location.
2007-03-06T06:25:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	the only thing there is the gaim thing
2007-03-06T06:25:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	and slightly differantly named
2007-03-06T06:26:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	i had to convert this pluggin from an RPM to a DEB maybe its a little differant where it put's it in redhat
2007-03-06T06:27:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	 and the other thing is that the pluggin is a .dat instead of a .so
2007-03-06T06:28:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	hm no idea. I think it should be an .so somewhere too.
2007-03-06T06:28:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	will i need gypsies to do this. or perhaps a voodoo doctor, or shaman.
2007-03-06T06:28:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	there is a #gaim channel maybe they know about specifics about that plugin.
2007-03-06T06:29:00.000Z	rylan	predaeus	ill try that
2007-03-12T11:12:00.000Z	predaeus	rylan	if you want to test your router, you can also use https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 that page can test ports. I do not know if this is also possible with nmap.
