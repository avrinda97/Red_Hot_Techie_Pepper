2009-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	apparle		how to solve this http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/269684/
2009-09-12T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	the url should be http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/  not http://in.archive.ubuntu.com
2009-09-12T15:19:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	but as you can see in the 2nd line.........link is alright.....with /ubuntu/
2009-09-12T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	change the first line
2009-09-12T15:21:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	this is my current sources.list http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/269686/ is there any problem
2009-09-12T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	that looks ok - try "sudo apt-get update "see what you get
2009-09-12T15:22:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	same error
2009-09-12T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	ok - can you please try "ping in.archive.ubuntu.com"
2009-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	I am able to get everything else from in.archive.ubuntu.com except universe packages
2009-09-12T15:25:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	look at line 4 in your sources.list - it's different
2009-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	Oh.....actually I tried to get the universe component from archive.ubuntu.com.........I can't get universe lists from in.archive.ubuntu.com,archive.ubuntu.com,us.archive.ubuntu.com.........tried all of them
2009-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	can you please try to ping it
2009-09-12T15:28:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	Actaully I am behind a proxy....so I know ping will not work
2009-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	then I suggest the problem is with your proxy
2009-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	try telneting to port 80 on the arhive
2009-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	how to do that
2009-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	telnet $hostname 80
2009-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	and which server should I telnet.....
2009-09-12T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	the one that's not working
2009-09-12T15:32:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
2009-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	ok - so either that host is down (which it doens't look like it is) or you're network/proxy is a problem
2010-02-27T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	please don't ask in here - this is ubuntu support
2010-02-27T22:59:00.000Z	apparle	ikonia	bazhang I know but I can't find one.... so I thought if someone is know he might help
2010-02-27T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	apparle	not in here they can't
