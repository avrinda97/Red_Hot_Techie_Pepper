2011-06-26T00:19:00.000Z	iamapickle		what's the command to unlock apt-get
2011-06-26T00:19:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	What makes you think it's locked?
2011-06-26T00:20:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Only one program can access the package management system at a time so you'll have to exit other apps like synaptic or update manager
2011-06-26T00:20:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	it's not now but earlier i was in icewm-lite and i accidentally killed the manager while a terminal was going with apt-get installing software
2011-06-26T00:21:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	been doing a lot of hard shutdown, i.e. power off
2011-06-26T00:23:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	i know only one can access it but the issue was that i interupted xterm by closing down the X window manager and the process wasnt in ps aux so it was locked up
2011-06-26T00:24:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	So where are you at now?
2011-06-26T00:24:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	i powered down and then powered up but the thing is i know there is a way to free that thing up somehow, there is a command for it
2011-06-26T00:25:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Yes but you're just beating around the bush. What command are you running and what is the output?
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	no, i was trying to see if anyone knew that command so next time i wouldnt have to hard reboot because i have lost the OS twice in the past two days
2011-06-26T00:26:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	my real issue is udev error on boot
2011-06-26T01:09:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Compared to what?
2011-06-26T01:10:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	comapred to ./configure, make, make install
2011-06-26T01:10:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	git and svn are revision tools. ie. they are responsible for managing files and changes, typically in a directory containing source code
2011-06-26T01:11:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	So you use these tools to gain access to a revision of a source repo, then build it with whatever configuration and build tools it requires
2011-06-26T01:12:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	the file is only 8 Mb compressed but takes forever
2011-06-26T01:13:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	What file?
2011-06-26T01:13:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	webkitgtk+, i need the latest version to configure html5 with epiphany
2011-06-26T01:14:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Ah, in that case yes. Use the revision tool to download the source, then configure it and compile/install
2011-06-26T01:15:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	or to get the plugin to work, some where some how i found a web page about how the latest webkitgtk+ can do html5 and youtube video
2011-06-26T01:15:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	they have a nightly build tarball, i just was hoping to get around having to compile the thing
2011-06-26T01:16:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Nah, the only way to get around building it is if they offer a precompiled binary (ie. deb package)
2011-06-26T01:17:00.000Z	iamapickle	soreau	those never work for me, usually only x86 and amd
2011-06-26T01:18:00.000Z	soreau	iamapickle	Well that's how it works. You use revision tools to get the source (git, svn, bzr, hg etc.) then build the source and from that, you can optionally create a distro package
