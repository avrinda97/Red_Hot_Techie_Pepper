2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	Asterix_		Anyone have some insight as to why a dvd won't mount even though it seems to mount okay?
2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	what do you mean when you say it seems to mount okay?
2007-10-31T01:06:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	I put the disc in, right click the drive and choose mount, the icon changes but yet there's no files when I browse to it.  I've tested the cds on another computer and they work properly there.
2007-10-31T01:08:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	is there any reason that it doesn't mount automatically?
2007-10-31T01:09:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	well I was trying to install a game with Wine and I had to force unmount the first disc...  now Ubuntu is giving me problems with mounting any other disc that I try with.
2007-10-31T01:09:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	ah, that's no fun.
2007-10-31T01:10:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	if I put the first disc in and mount it I can read the files fine...  but any other cd I put in will pretend to mount but the icon for the first disc shows up and if I browse there's just nothing.
2007-10-31T01:10:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	try System >> Prefereces >> Removable Drives and Media before we try anything else - Make sure everything in there relating to that drive is alright
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	ah. Also try running "winecfg" and setting the drives correctly - Then try "wine eject d:"
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	the first three check boxes under storage are checked...  beyond that I don't see anything out of the ordinary
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	ahh, that's okay then.
2007-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	I ejected with wine and if I try to do it again it says there's no drive.
2007-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	have you tried mounting the drive using the "mount" command?
2007-10-31T01:13:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	yes, I've tried it manually... here's the command I used sudo mount /dev/scd0
2007-10-31T01:13:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	try instead "sudo mount -o loop /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0"
2007-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	I've got new files when I browse the disk now!!!
2007-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	they all there?
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	err, is that good or bad news? :-P
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	and now when I clicked okay in the installation it's loading just fine!
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	ahh! Great! :-) Out of curiosity - Which game is it you're installing?
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	what exactly did the extra command do to fix it?  I'm doing Orange Box
2007-10-31T01:16:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	the "-o" passes an extra option to the "mount" command - CDFile Systems (ISOFS) need the "loop" option in mount to work properly, I'm pretty sure
2007-10-31T01:17:00.000Z	Asterix_	Jimmey	well going through the man file wouldn't have gotten me to choose the -o loop... thanks a ton for the help! :)
2007-10-31T01:21:00.000Z	Jimmey	Asterix_	you're welcome - It's worth noting too that if you copy CD's to your computer, you can mount the .iso file copies of any CD using the same command - "sudo mount -o loop /home/username/nameof.iso /media/cdrom0" - It will behave like the CD you copied the ISO from has been entered into the drive. If you fiddle with WINE a little bit, with some games, it works almost as a really-big noCD patch
