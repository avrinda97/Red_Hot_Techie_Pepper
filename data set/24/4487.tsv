2007-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	bruenig	That would be my issue.

2007-12-28T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	SpeakerMania	if that is the name, then you didn't get it from the ubuntu repos
2007-12-28T11:33:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	bruenig	I had to add a repository
2007-12-28T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	SpeakerMania	ok do: dpkg -L cinerella | grep bin
2007-12-28T11:34:00.000Z	bruenig	SpeakerMania	technically this is unsupported being third party and all
2007-12-28T11:34:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	bruenig	oh. I get this: Package `cinerella' is not installed.
2007-12-28T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	SpeakerMania	so you are confused somewhere, either you didn't install it, or it has a different name
2007-12-28T11:35:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	bruenig	hmm. How? I installed via Synaptic following the Gutsy instructions (I am indeed running Gutsy).
2007-12-28T11:35:00.000Z	bruenig	SpeakerMania	you saw the message, it isn't installed
2007-12-28T11:36:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	bruenig	Okay. Thanks.
