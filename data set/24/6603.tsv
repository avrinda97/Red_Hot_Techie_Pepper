2006-12-20T11:11:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		so, I'm going to download the liveCD, and I see an i386 option, but I also see an AMD64 option.  I have an Athlon 64 processor, do I have to use the AMD64 one?
2006-12-20T11:12:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		Brian - Oh, okay.  So, in your opinion, which one should I choose for a dualboot between Windows and Ubuntu?
2006-12-20T11:13:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		Okay, sounds good
2006-12-20T11:14:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		Now, this leads to the next question, how much of a pain in the ass is it to dual boot?  From what I've read it's rather difficult
2006-12-20T11:14:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		okay
2006-12-20T11:15:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		ah, okay.  That's where I was worried, a lot of things I read agreed with what hlds said
2006-12-20T11:15:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		yeah, my computer came with XP home preinstalled
2006-12-20T11:16:00.000Z	Jerimiah40		Dave - on the front of the drive, there will usually be a little tiny hole.  Stick a paperclip in, and the drive should pop open
2006-12-20T11:17:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	dual booting is not hard, but it is a waste of time
2006-12-20T11:17:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- in what way?
2006-12-20T11:18:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	because virtualization is a much better solution for primarily using one OS and occasionally switching to another.  Especially for work situations.  For games it is a little different.
2006-12-20T11:19:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- okay, fair enough
2006-12-20T11:20:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- I'm still mostly going to use XP, but I'd like to just mess around with linux at this point
2006-12-20T11:22:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	then install linux in a virtual machine.  You use it more if you don't have to reboot in to it.
2006-12-20T11:23:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	sorry, yes it is.  VMware player is free for download.  You can download several different pre-built linux virtual machines for it too.
2006-12-20T11:24:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- okay
2006-12-20T11:24:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	then once you're addicted to linux and know what you're doing, you'll wipe off that nasty MS stuff.
2006-12-20T11:26:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	here is a ubuntu virtual machine http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/ubuntu.html
2006-12-20T11:27:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- wait, you mean it comes preinstalled as ubuntu, I don't need to install it?
2006-12-20T11:27:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	that one does.  You download and install vmware player and then download the virtual machine and open it with vmware player.  Its already installed for you.  I haven't tried that exact one.
2006-12-20T11:28:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- ah, okay
2006-12-20T11:29:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	the main weakness of virtual machines is the graphics.   You should be able to run aiglx and beryl though if you have a fast machine.
2006-12-20T11:29:00.000Z	Jerimiah40	Falstius	- define fast?
2006-12-20T11:33:00.000Z	Falstius	Jerimiah40	for your first try, VM.  It is 100% safe.  After you're more comfortable you might want to dual boot.  You should have a gig of ram though, atleast 756MB.
