2007-01-31T10:17:00.000Z	LaKeTown		Well, I want to restore GRUB
2007-01-31T10:18:00.000Z	LaKeTown		because I've created a partition, GRUB was looking sda7 which becamoe sda8. Not realising this, I installed GAG a graphical OS selector which failed at its task and which I THINK, also emptied /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-01-31T10:19:00.000Z	LaKeTown		I've uninstalled GAG, but now, I want to try to get grub to boot Ubuntu
2007-01-31T10:20:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	I told you what to do 5 times already go into the directory that you mounted /dev/sda8 to then go to boot/grub and edit menu.lst
2007-01-31T10:21:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	I've etited it and it is empty? it can't possibly require only 1 line, can it?
2007-01-31T10:22:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	which menu.lst are you editing it shouldn't be /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-01-31T10:23:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	the only live you've told me about is "root (sd6,0)", however I doubt menu.lst will be complete with that
2007-01-31T10:24:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	what file are you editing since your probably editing the wrong file
2007-01-31T10:26:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	wow, I'm pretty stupid! the empy menu.lst was the one from the LiveCD
2007-01-31T10:29:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	here goes nothing. I've looked into the right menu.lst and modified all the lines that referred to sda7 to refer to sda8 instead
2007-01-31T10:31:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	I can't save menu.lst !
2007-01-31T10:31:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	you forgot to use sudo
2007-01-31T10:32:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	yes if your in the correct directory
2007-01-31T10:32:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	thanks, it has saved, now for the big boot
2007-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	you iwll have to reinstall grub
2007-01-31T10:33:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	even though I've redirected grub to the right partition??
2007-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	yep
2007-01-31T10:34:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	ah damn it! youre too right! it flew right through into Windows!
2007-01-31T10:35:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	this url shows you the best way to reinstall it without doing it manully https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2007-01-31T10:35:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	thank you!
2007-01-31T10:43:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	obviously, something went wrong... grub selection appears but this happens: "Booting 'Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.15-27-386'
2007-01-31T10:44:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	"root (hd0,6)     Filesystem type unknwown" where do I go about to change that reference? same place I'm guessins
2007-01-31T10:44:00.000Z	kitche	LaKeTown	(hd0,6 is for sda7 not sda8 it's in menu.lst
2007-01-31T10:46:00.000Z	LaKeTown	kitche	therefor,i should change it to "root (hd0,7) so it goes looking at sda8?
