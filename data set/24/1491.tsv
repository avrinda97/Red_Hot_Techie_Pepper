2009-12-21T15:43:00.000Z	mansa		I am not able to run the sudo apt-get update command in the terminal. It says cannot connect to the proxy
2009-12-21T15:44:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	are you using a connection that needs a proxy?
2009-12-21T15:44:00.000Z	mansa		 ellie: yes it is connected directly to the net
2009-12-21T15:44:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	i used to to use one before
2009-12-21T15:45:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	now you don't have a proxy? try export http_proxy"". i think it should work after this
2009-12-21T15:46:00.000Z	mansa		dnivra_I know that , the thing is i dont use proxy now , i am directly connected to the net
2009-12-21T15:47:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	I had added it in /etc/bash.bash.rc
2009-12-21T15:47:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	just run that command I gave you and it should work
2009-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	you'll need to keep doing that everytime you close the terminal and open it since it's in the bash.bashrc file
2009-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	I hashed it in /etc/bash.bashrc
2009-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	i suggest you uncomment/remove those entries you added from the file and then restart terminal as a permanent solution. for temporary just use the command I gave you:).
2009-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	comment*. good now restart terminal
2009-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	Well i did try that it is still not working
2009-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	i had done that before
2009-12-21T15:49:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	didn't get you; done what before?
2009-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	ok, removed the lines and restarted the terminal again
2009-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	any luck?
2009-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	no
2009-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	do echo $http_proxy. is it blank or has some value?
2009-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	no value
2009-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	i usually just set that value when necessary and then it works. it gets unset when I quit
2009-12-21T15:52:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	try running source /etc/bash.bashrc. doesn't work i've no idea; sorry. perhaps someone else would help out here.
2009-12-21T15:53:00.000Z	mansa	dnivra_	k
2009-12-21T15:53:00.000Z	dnivra_	mansa	let me know if it works ok. "source /etc/bash.bashrc" just a guess that's all:).
