2008-05-04T23:54:00.000Z	Surlent777		Again, does anyone know if the Restricted Drivers thing makes the NVIDIA settings tool, or if it was put on by Envy?
2008-05-04T23:56:00.000Z	Surlent777		...hm. Perhaps someone ought to suggest to the Ubuntu team to try putting in a "Downgrade" option, just in case.
2008-05-04T23:58:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	no no thank you
2008-05-04T23:43:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	Do you have an NVIDIA card?
2008-05-04T23:44:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	yes I do
2008-05-04T23:45:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	Do you have the NVIDIA Settings tool under Applications > System?
2008-05-04T23:46:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	no I don't
2008-05-04T23:47:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	I take it you tried the screen resolution tool under System > Preferences?
2008-05-04T23:49:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	if I  go into screen resolution I dont see a resolution tool, I only have two options, this is a fresh install on this computer but when I did the upgrade from 7.10 i remeber seeing the tool somewhere, now I dont have it
2008-05-04T23:50:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	I'm certain that there should be a dropbox with various resolutions. It's not there?
2008-05-04T23:51:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	yes that is there, and it only has 320x480 and 640x480
2008-05-04T23:52:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	I have a utility for configuring my NVIDIA card, but I can't remember how I got it. Does anyone know if the Restricted Drivers thing does that, or if it was put on by Envy?
2008-05-04T23:54:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	I will look around for something like that, I did install the restricted drivers just incase tha helps
2008-05-04T23:55:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	If you have it, it ought to be under Applications > System Tools, and have an icon of a green N on a black orb
2008-05-04T23:57:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	If you have it, you should be able to get to it by pressing Alt-F2 and then typing "nvidia-settings", without the quotes
2008-05-04T23:57:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	Thanks I just found tht online
2008-05-04T23:57:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	sorry =/
2008-05-04T23:59:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	Any results? Do you have said program?
2008-05-04T23:59:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	it won't actually open that program
2008-05-05T00:00:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	I guess you don't have it then...
2008-05-05T00:00:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	I am going to s ee if its in synaptic
2008-05-05T00:00:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	Never tried that. Good idea.
2008-05-05T00:03:00.000Z	morgan555	Surlent777	it is in there
2008-05-05T00:03:00.000Z	Surlent777	morgan555	To find it quicker, try just clicking on a package and then typing "nvida-settings" and se--ok then download it
