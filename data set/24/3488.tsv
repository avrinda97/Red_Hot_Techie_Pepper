2010-11-01T11:51:00.000Z	phasma		renice needs root even for your own processes?
2010-11-01T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	seems strange
2010-11-01T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	but so light. Oh the irony :)
2010-11-01T12:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	could go lighter with flwm ;)
2010-11-01T12:01:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I am pretty fond of that, too. I use the FLTK on another project
2010-11-01T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	could even use xpud on thins, it boots in seconds
2010-11-01T12:02:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	You know, I have never even looked at that yet.
2010-11-01T12:02:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Going to do so right now, mind. Thanks
2010-11-01T12:03:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Although boot speed is really not so much an issue when using LTSP
2010-11-01T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	its prettynice. I get a 3 second boot on a 1.6ghz cpu w/ 2Gb ddr2 and a PATA HDD w/ 2mb cache
2010-11-01T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	it has few drivers and few apps
2010-11-01T12:05:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Had a play around getting compiz to run over localapps yet? ;)
2010-11-01T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	I don't use compiz
2010-11-01T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	I use openbox
2010-11-01T12:06:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Oh, likewise. It was just an experiment for me
2010-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	can use: chmod +x then all users with read access will be given execute too :)
2010-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	True, though I am strict, heh
2010-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	no bad thing
2011-11-26T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	daily build of what?
2011-11-26T22:00:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Was the "daily-build" from unetbootin
2011-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	then ask in #ubuntu+1
2011-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	this is for support of released versions only, you are using Ubuntu which isn't even in alpha 1
2011-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phasma	I suggest you reinstall and use oneiric
2011-11-26T22:02:00.000Z	phasma	ActionParsnip	Sadly that is not an option for me as my network device is not supported and it is my only means of connecting. I'll sort it though. Thanks again
