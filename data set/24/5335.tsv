2007-03-23T10:23:00.000Z	axisme		Hi all. Having a slight problem. I have a CD that I can't view the contents of in linux but i can in WIndows. Linux works fine for other CDs but just not this set it seems. Is there certain files that linux can't view??
2007-03-23T10:25:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	what does it show you when you try to view the files?
2007-03-23T10:25:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	nothing at all
2007-03-23T10:25:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	just looks like its an empty CD
2007-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	have you tried to list the contents from the terminal?
2007-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	yeps, nothing there as well
2007-03-23T10:26:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	The cd itself is appearing on the desktop though? Is it mounted?
2007-03-23T10:27:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	yes it shows as mounted and appears on the desktop
2007-03-23T10:27:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	have you tryed using the ls -a /path/to/cd?
2007-03-23T10:28:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	try /media/cdrom0
2007-03-23T10:31:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	any ideas?
2007-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	What kind of files are they?
2007-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	one second, i will go check on my windows computer. they are different ones
2007-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	ok
2007-03-23T10:36:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	there are two folders. One with some .txt in and one with .wav in . There is a .exe  in the main directory and also a .dll and a .ini
2007-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	I honestly don't know why it wouldn't read it other than the disk being scratched I haven't had that problem before
2007-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	I have 4 disks in the set and they all do the same. all load fine on windows
2007-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	How can i check if its a DRM thing?
2007-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	Do they have some kind of DRM on them?
2007-03-23T10:40:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	try making a disk image and using ubuntu to open/burn them
2007-03-23T10:40:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	It has to be DRM
2007-03-23T10:42:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	K3B seems to not be able to read the contents either..
2007-03-23T10:42:00.000Z	clearzen	axisme	What cd is it?
2007-03-23T10:59:00.000Z	axisme	clearzen	creating an imagine and burning it didnt help. K3B actually did see it had 49 MB on it though and created an image of it. Now I have a copy that plays on windows OK and wont play on linux  :-(
