2006-09-27T09:04:00.000Z	_joe		so i tried it
2006-09-27T09:04:00.000Z	_joe		but i don't think he really knows much about linux
2006-09-27T09:04:00.000Z	_joe		cause this didn't happen with redhat
2006-09-27T09:04:00.000Z	_joe		ok
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		i'm sitting here and it says grub and then has several lines which i think is the shell prompt
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		some vmlinuc
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		and every time i try to sudo
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		i get "boot error!"
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		maybe i screwed up the install
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	_joe		yeah
2006-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	it sounds like it didn't boot and you're in the grub console wossname
2006-09-27T09:06:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	If you did a standard install, it should boot to a graphical login prompt
2006-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	....hard drive?  I'd suggest installing from a CD
2006-09-27T09:11:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	you are not in ubuntu
2006-09-27T09:12:00.000Z	_joe	Asc	no, i'm on my son's computer cause unbuntu won't run
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	On the computer where you are trying to run ubuntu, it is not in ubuntu.
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	_joe	Asc	well i think it is, but it just says "boot failed"
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	better yet, download the alternate install CD so you don't have to boot to a graphical environment.
2006-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	Do you know what a boot loader is?
2006-09-27T09:15:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	there's a place on the hard drive that stores a program that tells the computer what operating system to boot, and where it is.  The one that comes with Ubuntu (Grub) has a command line
2006-09-27T09:15:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	it *sounds like* the computer that you're trying to boot Ubuntu on, is in Grub's command line
2006-09-27T09:19:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	did you try to install windows just before this happened?
2006-09-27T09:21:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	when you booted, did it print a message like "GNU GRUB version x.xx (xxxx lower/ xxxxxx upper memory)"?
2006-09-27T09:24:00.000Z	Asc	_joe	Yes, that sounds like the grub prompt.  I have to leave right now, but try installing from a CD.  Or finding someone who knows how to use the GRUB prompt to boot.
