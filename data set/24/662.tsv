2011-04-06T17:19:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret		anyone familiar with cron?
2011-04-06T17:19:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	some.
2011-04-06T17:19:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	why aren't my commands runnning
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	hehe well, that can be for alot of reasons I guess...
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	checked that the cron daemon is running
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	i've also
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	how do i check to see if it's running
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	everytime I type cron, it says resources are being used
2011-04-06T17:20:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	"ps aux | grep cron"
2011-04-06T17:21:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	what do you get?
2011-04-06T17:22:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	there should be no "%" in that file
2011-04-06T17:22:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	can you post a pastebin of your cron-file?
2011-04-06T17:24:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	post a pastebin-link containing your crontab lines.... easier to see if anything is wrong with em then.
2011-04-06T17:27:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	you should have the full path to the file you want to run, for eg; * * * * * /bin/echo test > foo.foo
2011-04-06T17:35:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	add this line to ur crontab and see if it works; "*/1 * * * * /bin/echo foo > /home/username/foo" <--- should output a file named foo, containing the string foo.
2011-04-06T17:36:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	alright one moment
2011-04-06T17:41:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	it worked :)
2011-04-06T17:43:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	okey, then you can just erase my command and insert your own, it should all work then :)
2011-04-06T17:46:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	my commands still aren't working... I can tell they're running
2011-04-06T17:47:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	okey, how did you add ur commands?
2011-04-06T17:48:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	not that you have to specify where the command (my case "echo") is located
2011-04-06T17:48:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	note*
2011-04-06T17:48:00.000Z	BestKeptSecret	Ymer-	* * * * * /usr/bin/tomboy
2011-04-06T17:50:00.000Z	Ymer-	BestKeptSecret	then you should probably put it in /etc/rc.local instead
