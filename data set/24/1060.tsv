2010-08-12T02:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight		I have a problem with Update manager: "The package 'brscan' is in an inconsistent state and needs to be resinstalled, but no archive can be found for it. Do you want to remove it now to continue?"
2010-08-12T03:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight		When I click 'yes' it whirls away, but doesn't remove it. I'm offered to reinstall it. However, I cannot as dpkg complains
2010-08-12T03:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight		its like some Catch-22. Can someone help?

2010-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	chemical-death	livingdaylight	did your try "sudo apt-get install --reinstall brscan" in terminal? Or "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2010-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	livingdaylight	chemical-death	that's the catch-22 it won't let me reinstall either
