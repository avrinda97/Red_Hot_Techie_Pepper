2010-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		WHAT
2010-02-19T15:17:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		hurray!
2010-02-19T15:18:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		I just assume everyone is typing commands into a terminal
2010-02-19T15:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	still needs gksudo, even in term
2010-02-19T15:19:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	says who!
2010-02-19T15:20:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	Right, but sudo gedit still works..
2010-02-19T15:20:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	Are you going by what you know, or just from what you've heard in here?
2010-02-19T15:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	please provide proper advice, that means gksudo for gui apps and sudo for cli apps only. You can do whatever yoiu want with your system
2010-02-19T15:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	if you would read the page ubottu posted, you'd know why
2010-02-19T15:22:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	You didn't answer my question -- sudo gedit still works if you're running it in a terminal -- I _DID_ read that page, it only says its an issue for firefox and other applications, NOT for something like gedit
2010-02-19T15:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	please provide proper advice, that means gksudo for gui apps and sudo for cli apps only. You can do whatever you want with your system
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	feel free to discuss this with the ops in #ubuntu-ops, it's channel policy
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	So you can't actually answer my question..
2010-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	it's channel policy <-- your answer
2010-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	You should join #guifications and check our their channel policy
2010-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	So do you actually answer anyones questions in here?
2010-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	Or just moderate?
2010-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	Please be productive.
2010-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	Last time I checked I was in here on my own accord at 5:40am EST answering peoples questions..
2010-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	May I pm you?
2010-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	ardchoille	No.
2010-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	I guess you don't really want an answer then :)
2010-02-19T15:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	EvilDennisR	I've been answering questions in this channel and on the ubuntu forums for years :)
