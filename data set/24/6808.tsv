2006-02-22T07:38:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian		hi...i need info about a package release...
2006-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian		like synaptic or aptitude does...
2006-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian		i mean..in command-line...
2006-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	"sudo apt-get upgrade -s"
2006-02-22T07:41:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	where 's' stands for 'simulate'
2006-02-22T07:42:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 thanks... is that!
2006-02-22T07:43:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	"apt-cache show postgresql"  will give you some info :)
2006-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 i need know why it is not upgraded... :(...is getting too old...
2006-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 postgres in ubuntu is in 7.4.7...is beeing unusefull.....stable versionb from postgres is 8.1
2006-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 need know why and what can I do...
2006-02-22T07:46:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	ubuntu releases a new version every six months.. after a release it doesnt take any non-securityrelated updates.. so new versions of packages go into the next version of ubuntu..
2006-02-22T07:46:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 I am with ubuntu 5.04 here
2006-02-22T07:46:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	there seems to be a postgresql-8.0 package though :)
2006-02-22T07:47:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	what sources can i safelly put here in synaptic to get those packages, more recents
2006-02-22T07:48:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	none.. just use main, universe and multiverse..
2006-02-22T07:48:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	is there a specific reason why you prefer 8.1 over 8.0.3?
2006-02-22T07:49:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 thanks by help
2006-02-22T07:50:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	just install 8.0 :) you probably wont miss a thing..
2006-02-22T07:50:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 in true....most recents versions are a great adventure...but i really prefer that the comunity make alll tests needed before install in a production machine...
2006-02-22T07:51:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	just installing a new version because it's 'new', is a good way to get your system unstable :)
2006-02-22T07:51:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 yes...i think will be nice.. 8)
2006-02-22T07:51:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 yeah...i know...hehehehe
2006-02-22T07:51:00.000Z	wdh	Aragorn_Guardian	it'll probably be included into ubuntu 6.04 once it's released (april)
2006-02-22T07:53:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	wdh	 well...thanks again...gonna read about...thanks a lot!
