2012-11-01T23:33:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i know someone just answered me, but i accidently switched channels
2012-11-01T23:34:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		how can i switch to a dialog window via keyboard?
2012-11-01T23:34:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		thats fucking beautiful considering i have no mouse
2012-11-01T23:35:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		thanks asshole
2012-11-01T23:35:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i know how to /join
2012-11-01T23:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	XiaolinDraconis	also, why on earth are you attempting to use xchat without a mouse?
2012-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i dont have one available atm
2012-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp		(one might ask why attempt to use xchat *at all*, but that's out of scope here)
2012-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		haha good one
2012-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		cause its default in buntu
2012-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		i know how to do that
2012-11-01T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	XiaolinDraconis	kill xchat, install irssi, and use the keyboard for everything
2012-11-01T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp		boom, fixed
2012-11-01T23:37:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		thing is the only populated and helpful channel in all of freenode happens to be #ubuntu
2012-11-01T23:38:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	gordonjcp	thanks gordan ill give that a go, i managed to open keyboard shortcuts for xchat and dont see an option for switching already open channels
2012-11-01T23:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	XiaolinDraconis	try something like ctrl-left and right or something
2012-11-01T23:40:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		sorry for the attitude, im sure you can imagine having no mouse makes for a bad day
2012-11-01T23:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp		does it?
2012-11-01T23:40:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis		useful tips are still useless
2012-11-01T23:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp		at some point I unplugged my mouse to plug something else in and never got around to reconnecting it
2012-11-01T23:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp		but, I'm using Unity, which is pretty good for keyboard shortcuts
2012-11-01T23:41:00.000Z	XiaolinDraconis	gordonjcp	had this been windows i wouldnt have a problem navigating with a keyboard
2012-11-01T23:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	XiaolinDraconis	because you're more familiar with it
2012-11-01T23:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	XiaolinDraconis	had I been on Windows I wouldn't have been able to navigate it at all, with or without a mouse
