2011-01-30T13:02:00.000Z	col0ur		Hello, I'm on 8.04 (please no upgrade comments). My wireless was working fine until today, when I restarted, and only wired was available. At the same time, the Hibernate option, which wasn't previous available from the Shut Down menu, appeared on said menu. It appears to simply not be detecting eth1 at all (which is my wireless interface). Any ideas?
2011-01-30T13:02:00.000Z	gkasinath	col0ur	what wifi card do you use?
2011-01-30T13:03:00.000Z	col0ur		I'm not too sure.

2011-01-30T13:04:00.000Z	gkasinath	col0ur	specifically about your wifi card. If you looked at the log output, there should be a clue.
