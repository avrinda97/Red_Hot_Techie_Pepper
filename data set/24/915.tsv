2010-11-01T19:55:00.000Z	TomShatt		Hey guys, any way to remove some program from gnome systray?
2010-11-01T19:56:00.000Z	TomShatt		How to run Thunderbird in background? :D
2010-11-01T19:57:00.000Z	TomShatt		Ubuntu users, what mail client do you use? :D
2010-11-01T19:57:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I'm trying to figure that out right now actually.
2010-11-01T19:58:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I'm torn between evolution and thunderbird.
2010-11-01T19:58:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	on one hand, I like evolution because it EASILY integrated my google calendar. On the other hand, its a POS otherwise. Very slow, crashes a lot, locks up a lot, etc.
2010-11-01T19:58:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	YET thunderbird is reliable, it works. bam. opens each time. VERY fast. However Thunderbird's integration of lightning extension and google calendar is a complete joke.
2010-11-01T20:00:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	What did you stop at right now?
2010-11-01T20:00:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	what do you mean what did I stop at?
2010-11-01T20:00:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I'll probably end up sticking with thunderbird, because evolution has proven to be unreliable enough that I just dont trust using it as my main mail client.
2010-11-01T20:01:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	systray or indicator?
2010-11-01T20:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I'd rather use google calendar in the web interface + thunderbird for mail instead of trying to rely on evolution for EVERYTHING when it suffers to even open.
2010-11-01T20:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I never ran thunderbird in the indicator. This was the first time I ever heard of that being possible.
2010-11-01T20:01:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	thunderbird just pops up in the lower right with the email preview for 2-3 secs and I open it when I feel like it. How easy is it to inttegrate it?
2010-11-01T20:02:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	Indicator takes less space, since it goes in one button, also notification like in pidgin messages is possible too.
2010-11-01T20:02:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	yeah I know pidgin shoots up to that icon and turns it green. Thats possible with thunderbird???
2010-11-01T20:02:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	Na, i meaned what indicator applet does.
2010-11-01T20:02:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	With notify lib.
2010-11-01T20:03:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	Just, i have only one problem left, how to make thunderbird keep running when i close it.
2010-11-01T20:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	not sure of that one. I just let it run.
2010-11-01T20:05:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	Well, if use systray addon, anyway to use it and remove thunderbird icon from systray? I already have it on indicator, why to have it in tray? xD
2010-11-01T20:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	good thought. I just havent thought about it.
2010-11-01T20:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	TomShatt	I was more concerned about trying to make thunderbird act more like Outlook or Evolution (but without the BS) and its proving hard to do so.
2010-11-01T20:06:00.000Z	TomShatt	Roasted_	I'm googling right now anything like "hide icon from system tray" but.. no success yet.
