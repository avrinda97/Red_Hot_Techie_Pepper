2011-01-18T06:34:00.000Z	^Mike\b		When I try to change the theme on my desktop, it isn't applied properly. I've tried reinstalling my theme and icon packages, but that didn't help. What more can I do?
2011-01-18T06:35:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	is the correct engine for the theme installed?
2011-01-18T06:36:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	I assume so - *none* of the themes apply themselves correctly. I'm stuck on the fugly fallback theme you get when you do `gksudo gedit` etc
2011-01-18T06:36:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	here is a list: apt-cache search gtk2-engines
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	the default theme uses an engine in the following package : gtk2-engines
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	I just reinstalled it - no change :\
2011-01-18T06:38:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	are you using gnome?
2011-01-18T06:38:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	yes
2011-01-18T06:39:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	try logging in with another user. if this works there is something wrong in your configfiles
2011-01-18T06:39:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	will do
2011-01-18T06:40:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	AHA!! It does work on a guest user! :D
2011-01-18T06:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	i can't tell you how to fix it without getting rid of your config alltogether
2011-01-18T06:41:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	If you can point me to where this configuration is stored, I'll try poking around in there a bit.
2011-01-18T06:44:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	don't know. somewhere in .gconf/   or   .config/
2011-01-18T06:45:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	ok, I'll have a peek
2011-01-18T06:46:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	thanks, trying another user account was smart, i should have thought of that
2011-01-18T06:47:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	.gconf/apps/metacity/   i think this is it.
2011-01-18T06:48:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	seems like it's not the only thing though .gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/
2011-01-18T06:50:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	Yeah, a search for 'theme' shows lots of results...
2011-01-18T06:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	should just be the 2 directories i gave you.
2011-01-18T06:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	seems like it's not the only thing though .gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/
2011-01-18T06:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	.gconf/apps/metacity/   i think this is it.
2011-01-18T07:29:00.000Z	^Mike\b	sam-_-	What was the drastic action you were going to suggest to blow away my settings in gconf to hopefully un-stick my theme? Just delete ~/.gconf?
2011-01-18T07:29:00.000Z	sam-_-	^Mike\b	that would work as well. do make a backup though.
