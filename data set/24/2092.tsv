2009-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	could the bare essentials include username and password setting in mysql?that'd help
2009-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	could the bare essentials include username and password setting in phpmyadmin?that'd help
2009-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	yes
2009-08-21T07:56:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	I have to see if I remember this though
2009-08-21T07:56:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	how do i go around that?
2009-08-21T07:57:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	alright so you've logged into mysql as root?
2009-08-21T07:59:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	#2002 - The server is not responding (or the local MySQL server's socket is not correctly configured)  thats what i get, and whats the username and password anyway?don't think i have that right either.
2009-08-21T08:01:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	when you first try to login to mysql you just need to type myswl then you get to configuring users and passwords, to login with a user and password mysql -u user -p then tupe password
2009-08-21T08:01:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	based on your error though that is not the problem
2009-08-21T08:05:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	I think I know what your problem is but I have to think for a sec there's something you have to run to configure mysql
2009-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	yes and maybe this will also help, ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2).its what i get when i type mysql -u root
2009-08-21T08:15:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	the mysql daemone is not running
2009-08-21T08:20:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	think you are right, still on this puff ?
2009-08-21T08:24:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	alright I think the first time t
2009-08-21T08:25:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	the first time you start the mysql server you want to use mysqld_safe so try running that
2009-08-21T08:27:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	did you try running mysqld_safe
2009-08-21T08:27:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	command not found
2009-08-21T08:29:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	you'll want to run this as root so sudo /usr/bin/mysqld_safe
2009-08-21T08:29:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	ok
2009-08-21T08:30:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	if it worked try mysql again
2009-08-21T08:33:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	nmvictor	yeah
2009-08-21T08:40:00.000Z	nmvictor	Irishmanluke	yea, we are considering a reinstall
