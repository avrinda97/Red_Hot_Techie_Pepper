2006-10-29T15:42:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		funny how we suddenly discuss viruses instead of useability :)
2006-10-29T15:43:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		coz you were cornered?
2006-10-29T15:43:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		very trivial.. the saga continues
2006-10-29T15:44:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		i can't play frozen-bubble on windows
2006-10-29T15:45:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		i don't need to discuss windows, I know everything there is to know about windows :)
2006-10-29T15:46:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		godmachine, compile source.. sounds like the right way for gamers!
2006-10-29T15:47:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		godmachine, i'm not gonna bother arguing :)
2006-10-29T15:48:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		i don't want to learn my OS, i want my OS to be a transparent layer that allows me to run my _apps_
2006-10-29T15:50:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		big band?
2006-10-29T15:50:00.000Z	Scorpmoon		every windows user is a troll according to linuxers :)
2006-10-29T15:51:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	no, they are not, but can we move on now, please?
2006-10-29T15:52:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	I'm not sure what you have tried yet. usually   sudo apt-get install frozen-bubble  does it
2006-10-29T15:52:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Lynoure	http://www.frozen-bubble.org/downloads/ .. can you install that one?
2006-10-29T15:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	it's really easier to use that line to install it on ubuntu
2006-10-29T15:53:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Lynoure	what line
2006-10-29T15:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	sudo apt-get install frozen-bubble
2006-10-29T15:53:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Lynoure	and then I get this kind of error: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/frozen-bubble/+bug/1292
2006-10-29T15:55:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	Are you using Breezy? If not, your sources.list is out of date
2006-10-29T15:56:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/frozen-bubble/+bug/1292 is not an error you get on edgy, please point us to the real error you get
2006-10-29T15:56:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Lynoure	it's as close as it gets... it says libsdl-perl is not installable
2006-10-29T15:56:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	can you pastebin your sources.list?
2006-10-29T15:57:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	Lynoure	sorry no
2006-10-29T15:58:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	then, sorry, I cannot help you further
2006-10-29T16:01:00.000Z	Lynoure	Scorpmoon	if you are using edgy, as a last resort you can get that package from this page: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/perl/libsdl-perl
