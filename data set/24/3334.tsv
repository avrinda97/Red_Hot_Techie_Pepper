2008-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	remu	jim_p	but as of right now, it is not detecting bluetooth, it was before i followed this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothAudio
2008-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	jim_p	remu	its because of the network manager getting involved, trust me. too bad i dont have a log of a convo with another guy about the same subject to show you
2008-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	remu	jim_p	well, i dont mind trying your suggestion, I just don't know the proper way of going about it.
2008-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	jim_p	remu	are you on wireless now?
2008-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	remu	jim_p	network manager has my auto eth0 and wlan0 both connected
2008-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	jim_p	remu	...and bluetooth "stuck" too
2008-11-07T11:16:00.000Z	remu	jim_p	what do you mean by "stuck"?
