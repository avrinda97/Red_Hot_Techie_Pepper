2008-09-14T02:36:00.000Z	josh-		hello all
2008-09-14T02:36:00.000Z	josh-		i really need help!
2008-09-14T02:38:00.000Z	josh-		can i reset the root password by rebooting to single user?
2008-09-14T02:38:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	yes, but it's not recommended
2008-09-14T02:51:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	you shouldn't su to root
2008-09-14T02:51:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	what are you trying to to?
2008-09-14T02:51:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	if the truth be told i am helping a friend.
2008-09-14T02:51:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	to do what?
2008-09-14T02:52:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	what is the problem?
2008-09-14T02:53:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	im not really sure all the commands he ran at this point but basically the shell was changed to zsh and then chnged back but the command ran was chsh -s bash instead of the full path. now he cannot sudo to root
2008-09-14T03:00:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	are you sure it's worth working on this badly hacked system? A reinstall might make everything nice and easy
2008-09-14T03:01:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	it was a simple mistake of some sort, this 'badly hacked system' was and still is a perfectly good system that has many happy users. :-)
2008-09-14T03:01:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	it was a simple mistake of some sort, this 'badly hacked system' was and still is a perfectly good system that was working fine 20 minutes ago* and has many happy users. :-)
2008-09-14T03:08:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	hazrd11 was asking the incorrect question, actually.
2008-09-14T03:09:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	got it, thanks
2008-09-14T03:16:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	hey, it's not my fault that you didn't offer decent advice ;)
2008-09-14T03:50:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	(reluctantly) yeess?
2008-09-14T03:51:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	you need both Flannel and me?
2008-09-14T03:53:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	Flannel ^_^
2008-09-14T03:54:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	what do you get from a 'grep root /etc/passwd'?
2008-09-14T03:55:00.000Z	josh-	soundray	root:x:0:0:root:/root:bash
2008-09-14T03:56:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	that'll be the problem. You need to reboot, choose recovery mode, edit /etc/password and change that line to read    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
2008-09-14T03:57:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	does that make sense?
2008-09-14T04:01:00.000Z	soundray	josh-	no, it doesn't -- unless you've gone against the grain and set one.
