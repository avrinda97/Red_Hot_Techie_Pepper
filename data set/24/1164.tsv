2010-06-16T22:17:00.000Z	zoug		hey anyone using gnome-panel's auto-hide feature? it doesnt show-up after its been hidden, anyone else experiencing the same thing?
2010-06-16T22:18:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	make sure that the panel does not have an unusually high unhide delay set in gconf-editor
2010-06-16T22:19:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	yeah i checked it, its safe.
2010-06-16T22:20:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	have you tried using gconf-editor to turn off auto-hide and then re-enable it?
2010-06-16T22:20:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	sometimes quirky things like that take care of the issue
2010-06-16T22:21:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	yeah, it works that way, but no one would like to fix it everytime with gconf editor
2010-06-16T22:21:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	am i the only one having the issue?
2010-06-16T22:22:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	not suffesting using gconf-editor everytime you need to access the panel. Just that changing the settings and then putting them back may fix the problem
2010-06-16T22:23:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	does the same problem occur when you change the panel orientation?
2010-06-16T22:27:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	yes, placing panel anywhere, it shows the same problem
2010-06-16T22:28:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	are you having any similar problems?
2010-06-16T22:29:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	no, I have not run into this problem
2010-06-16T22:29:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	What is the autohide size set to in gconf-editor?
2010-06-16T22:31:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	1
2010-06-16T22:32:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	try setting it to 4 and see if it unhides. I realize it won't be completely hidden, but just give it a shot
2010-06-16T22:36:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	nope, it wont work, i think its nothing to do with the unhide problem
2010-06-16T22:37:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	perhaps - I suggested 4 because I just spoke with colleague that had a similar problem on Karmic. Panel would not unhide unless the auot_hide_size was at least 4
2010-06-16T22:37:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	not sure what else to suggest though
2010-06-16T22:38:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	do you have any drawers on the panel? are you using Compiz?
2010-06-16T22:38:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	yeah, compiz, no drawers, i think i might switch to metacity and that would work
2010-06-16T22:39:00.000Z	kryptyk	zoug	that was my next suggestion. Doing som quick reading shows Compiz as a major cause for panels not unhiding. I have not seen any immediate solutions though.
2010-06-16T22:40:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	okay lemme try
2010-06-16T22:45:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	this is surprising, i tried many times before switiching to metacity, if i get my mouse pointer to any of the corners it works all the time. its weird.
2010-06-16T22:45:00.000Z	zoug	kryptyk	may be 100/150 pixels from the edge, it works.
