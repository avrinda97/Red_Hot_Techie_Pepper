2010-12-27T04:25:00.000Z	kukenifittan		some page says I have to recompile the kernel
2010-12-27T04:26:00.000Z	kukenifittan		can that really be true?
2010-12-27T04:26:00.000Z	kukenifittan		serious?
2010-12-27T04:26:00.000Z	kukenifittan		how do I recompile the kernel then?
2010-12-27T04:26:00.000Z	kukenifittan		Samsung Galaxy S
2010-12-27T04:26:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	go to the USB settings on your device....change it to asks which you want :D
2010-12-27T04:27:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	I did that but it doesn't work
2010-12-27T04:27:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	You said to use it as a mass storage device?
2010-12-27T04:27:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	yes
2010-12-27T04:29:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	What do you get on your Galaxy when you connect...a green android asking to connect?
2010-12-27T04:30:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	yes
2010-12-27T04:30:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	Does it change to orange when you confirm?
2010-12-27T04:30:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	it asks me if I want to connect the usb storage to the computer
2010-12-27T04:31:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	which version are you running of android and ubuntu?
2010-12-27T04:32:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	Android is 2.2
2010-12-27T04:34:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	Can you find which version Ubuntu you run?
2010-12-27T04:35:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	Ubuntu 8
2010-12-27T04:36:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	You can find it in System Monitor (inside System menu) or in terminal with uname
2010-12-27T04:37:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	I'm not in Ubuntu right now though
2010-12-27T04:41:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	Well...Ubuntu 8 (.04 or .10) are very old...being April 2008 or October 2008. I would first suggest upgrading to 10.10 (latest version of Ubuntu). Or 10.04 which is LTS (Long Time Service) (I presume you have 8.04 which is also a LTS). (My preference is 10.10, better in my experience)
2010-12-27T04:41:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	ok will that make so I won't have to recompile the kernel?
2010-12-27T04:43:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	kukenifittan	You won't need to manually recompile the kernel, seeing a more recent kernel is automatically installed. I do suggest a fresh install compared to a upgrade :)
2010-12-27T04:44:00.000Z	kukenifittan	Ryu_Kurisu	ok
