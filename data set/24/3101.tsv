2008-05-28T01:12:00.000Z	limac		guys, how do you kill X in ubuntu
2008-05-28T01:12:00.000Z	fde	limac	just log out... or type 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop'
2008-05-28T01:12:00.000Z	fde	limac	ctrl+alt+backspace is bad.
2008-05-28T01:13:00.000Z	limac	fde	ok thanks you, that is going to put me in the CLI right, because I have to install my nVdia drivers and it requires X to be shut off
2008-05-28T01:13:00.000Z	fde	limac	yup... then just '/etc/init.d/gdm start' when you're done setting it up.
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	limac	fde	 oh nm
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	fde	limac	ctrl + alt + backspace will just respawn x ... not useful  :P
2008-05-28T01:14:00.000Z	limac	fde	thank you very much :)
2008-05-28T01:15:00.000Z	limac	fde	what did you say the command was again?
2008-05-28T01:15:00.000Z	fde	limac	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop ... then same bug start when you want it back.
2008-05-28T01:16:00.000Z	limac	fde	thanks mate :)
2008-05-28T05:37:00.000Z	fde	limac	Yes...
2008-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	limac	fde	you think 32-bit might fix it?
2008-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	fde	limac	In general, 64bit is a pita with Ubuntu.
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	limac	fde	dsfine pita
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	fde	limac	makes things a pain.
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	limac	fde	ok then 64-bit it is
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	fde	limac	no good multiarch support.
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	fde	limac	32bit
2008-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	limac	fde	I mean 32-bit it is :P
2008-05-28T05:40:00.000Z	limac	fde	I will try that..thanks man :)
