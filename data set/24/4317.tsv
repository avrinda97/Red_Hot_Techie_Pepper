2010-10-26T13:36:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	cheers
2010-10-26T13:37:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	know how to get it to rebuild smb.conf? tried rm smb.conf and reinstalling samba but no smb.conf
2010-10-26T13:38:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	not sure why you'd want to rm it when you could've just mv'd it elsewhere, but what command are you using to reinstall?
2010-10-26T13:39:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	sudo aptitude install samba
2010-10-26T13:39:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	try this:  sudo aptitude reinstall samba
2010-10-26T13:40:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	start: Job failed to start
2010-10-26T13:44:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	not sure... maybe you need to remove it, then install it again?
2010-10-26T13:44:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	Im not sure it reinstalls .conf and that may be why it will not start
2010-10-26T13:46:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	might need to make sure everything gets purged then:  sudo apt-get purge samba
2010-10-26T14:07:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	so I guess there is one @ /usr/share/samba/smb.conf
2010-10-26T14:08:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	excellent.
2010-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	cjae	Gnea	and as soon as the file is replaced samba reinstalls as expected
2010-10-26T14:13:00.000Z	Gnea	cjae	good
