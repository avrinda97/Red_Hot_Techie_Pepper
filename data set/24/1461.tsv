2010-01-17T18:02:00.000Z	JakobSteinn		Hi everyone! When I open my gnome-terminal the 'box' is empty, what can I do?  It does not output the "user@host" stuff in the beginning.
2010-01-17T18:03:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	What about sometime later, after this beginning?
2010-01-17T18:05:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	Hi thanks for reply, The whole box is empty.
2010-01-17T18:06:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Do you happen to have desktop effects enabled in sys>prefs>appearance>visual effects? ie. anything other than None
2010-01-17T18:06:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	Yes.
2010-01-17T18:07:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	If you set it to None, does it make a difference?
2010-01-17T18:07:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	No not at all. :(
2010-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	So its not a compositing or graphics issue.. something is wrong with your terminal
2010-01-17T18:09:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	Well I installed the wm 'awsome' and then when I opened a terminal, tried both xterm and gnome-terminal it was just blank.. so I went back to gnome and uninstalled.. but nothing got better, sadly.
2010-01-17T18:11:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	I dont know what is going on there.. maybe you can check your terminal profile?
2010-01-17T18:12:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Maybe the text color is the same as the background
2010-01-17T18:16:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	no I wish so but my friend and I also ssh to this computer and we even could not write anything from there..  well yes we can write something but it has no effect..
2010-01-17T18:17:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Sounds like you broke your ubuntu ;)
2010-01-17T18:21:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Well the first thing to fixing it is identifying the problem. Unfortunately I have no idea how you broke it
2010-01-17T18:23:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	Yea... well I installed the desktop manager 'awesome' and then afterwards my terminal went like "ka-booom"
2010-01-17T18:25:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	MAybe you can try creating a new users
2010-01-17T18:26:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	If another user is ok this points to a bad setting in your home folder
2010-01-17T18:27:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	how do I create another user without my term?
2010-01-17T18:28:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	I think there is user handling in sys>admin
2010-01-17T18:28:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	I am kind of handicaped you see? without my term and all..
2010-01-17T18:29:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Obviously but I think the gui method is in sys>admin>users and groups
2010-01-17T18:30:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	There, you would click Unlock then Add User
2010-01-17T18:31:00.000Z	soreau	JakobSteinn	Then, log out and log back in as the new user
2010-01-17T18:32:00.000Z	JakobSteinn	soreau	great! I will try that now (; thanks mate ! maybe I will be back! .. hopefully not. maybe with another problem sometime (:
