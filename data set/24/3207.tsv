2008-03-29T10:09:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	its just a collection of software that you can download from the repositories
2008-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	and themes
2008-03-29T10:11:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	http://ubuntustudio.org/
2008-03-29T10:13:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	where did you see this?
2008-03-29T10:13:00.000Z	AdrianStrays	ani1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Studio#Features
2008-03-29T10:14:00.000Z	AdrianStrays	ani1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Studio#Features
2008-03-29T10:16:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	the only thing i see in the repositories about audio is additional plugins
2008-03-29T10:16:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	under the desc nothing about a modified or different kernel i have ubuntustudio installed
2008-03-29T10:19:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	The original version, based on Ubuntu 7.04, was released 2007-05-10. << this makes no sense
2008-03-29T10:19:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	if that were true they would have had a livecd out by now
2008-03-29T10:20:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	i look at it just as a application, theme, and sound bundle so you dont need to manually search for everything and its a complete package
2008-03-29T10:21:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	it could install the rt kernel and that could be what its referring too idk :\
2008-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	ani1	AdrianStrays	they have a download for it if your truly interested in finding out what the difference is http://ubuntustudio.org/downloads
