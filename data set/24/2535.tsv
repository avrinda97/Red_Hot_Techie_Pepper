2008-11-15T15:00:00.000Z	Saroset		Can someone please help me dig myself out of this mess I'm in?
2008-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	Saroset		Holy hell, I've asked questions already. Right now, I have a computer with no boot manager that is trying to load over a network. This started when no one would tell me how I can use or get rid of the Windows boot manager because it wouldn't let me install.
2008-11-15T15:02:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	what are you trying to install?
2008-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	so when you try to install kubuntu you are getting errors?
2008-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	I cant even get to the install yet.
2008-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	okay why not... I'm sorry I missed your original problem. I caught something about you are trying a network install?
2008-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	I deleted my boot manager and windows partition while tinkering.
2008-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	okay.
2008-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	do you have physical access to the machine?
2008-11-15T15:05:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	and do you need to recover your windows partition? Or are you just trying to install kubuntu alone.
2008-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	at this point neither of those seems possible. I'd prefer to just get kubuntu installed though.
2008-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	do you have a kubuntu cd?
2008-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	yes
2008-11-15T15:07:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	then boot the kubuntu cd.
2008-11-15T15:07:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	that's the problem. There's nothing to boot it.
2008-11-15T15:07:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	your bios controls what the machine trys to boot first. Not the boot manager on the physical hard drive.
2008-11-15T15:09:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	my bios seems to hate me.
2008-11-15T15:09:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	why is that? can you change the boot sequence?
2008-11-15T15:10:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	yes. I've moved everything up, down, on, off, and it seems to make no difference at all in the behaviour.
2008-11-15T15:10:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	well you would make the cdrom first then the hard drive second etc.... Then save the configuration.
2008-11-15T15:11:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	Why do you think you deleted your windows partition?
2008-11-15T15:11:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	do you want to join #ubuntu-classroom theres a little less chat in there it would be easier to follow.
2008-11-15T15:11:00.000Z	Saroset	histo	sure.
2008-11-15T15:12:00.000Z	histo	Saroset	let me know when you are there. you can /j #ubuntu-classroom
