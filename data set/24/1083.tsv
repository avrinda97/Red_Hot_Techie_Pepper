2010-08-16T09:28:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	you don't care about what?
2010-08-16T09:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-08-16T09:32:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	as far as i can see, it's not a player
2010-08-16T09:33:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	no, it's a software library
2010-08-16T09:33:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-08-16T09:34:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	that command is like k-codecs
2010-08-16T09:35:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	it's NOT a codec, it's code used for writing programs
2010-08-16T09:37:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	quicktime is the name for many things, not just a media player
2010-08-16T09:46:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	what's your native language?
2010-08-16T09:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	write: /join #ubuntu-cn

2010-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	what's your problem?
2010-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	yeabean	type this in a terminal : sudo apt-get install vlc
