2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	what are you trying to do?
2008-10-29T22:39:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	trying to have some very very old pluggins to run with a newer system
2008-10-29T22:40:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	what is the email address of the plugin author?
2008-10-29T22:41:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	I think it's djeyl
2008-10-29T22:41:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	yes, it is djeyl that made this plugin
2008-10-29T22:41:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	why not email them and ask them to make the mod work on current ubuntu? :)
2008-10-29T22:42:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	he hasnt supported it for like 4 years but... it might be worth a shot to ask ;)
2008-10-29T22:42:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	also, if you have the source, you could take over maintainership.  It's a fair bit of work though.
2008-10-29T22:43:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	I,m very very buzy ;) I work something near 85 hours a week so I dont think I'd be a very active dev for that ;)
2008-10-29T22:43:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	besides, I dont even know whats the language used in that? is that c++?
2008-10-29T22:43:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	probably
2008-10-29T22:44:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	I suck at c++ :(
2008-10-29T22:44:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	you don't have to know any c++
2008-10-29T22:44:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	you need only recompile
2008-10-29T22:44:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	yeah, but to maintain and correct errors, I'd need to play in the code and if it's not very documented, I'm screwed... anyway, Ill drop him a mail and see what happens
2008-10-29T22:45:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	LjL : thx for the help guys
2008-10-29T22:45:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	get him to post the code online.  what errors?  it has errors?
2008-10-29T22:45:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	I dont know, I dont have the source yet, but I bet there will be errors ;)
2008-10-29T22:45:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	but they are unfixed
2008-10-29T22:46:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	leave them unfixed.  just build it with newer glibc, then release online.
2008-10-29T22:46:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	ill try to get the sources from djeyl and see what happens
2008-10-29T22:46:00.000Z	Joker_-_	jspiro	thx again
2008-10-29T22:53:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	open source stuff looks great on your resume if you are applying to computer jobs, especially maintainership.
2008-10-29T22:53:00.000Z	jspiro	Joker_-_	it worked for me at an interview.  I maintain a Firefox addon.
