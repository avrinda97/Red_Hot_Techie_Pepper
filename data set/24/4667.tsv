2007-02-10T14:51:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	flash 9 for linux is available now
2007-02-10T14:53:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	Download the tgz instead
2007-02-10T14:53:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	Download the tgz, extract it, and run ./installflashplayer
2007-02-10T14:54:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	What is the error?
2007-02-10T15:03:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	I will see your mesages better if you type jason__:
2007-02-10T15:05:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	dont just click on it, Open a terminal and cd to the folder where you extracted it, and then type ./installflashplayer
2007-02-10T15:05:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	you may have to type sudo ./installflashplayer though
2007-02-10T15:05:00.000Z	oggie	jason__	thank you
2007-02-10T15:08:00.000Z	oggie	jason__	sudo ./installflashplayer : command not found ..i got this error
2007-02-10T15:09:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	Are you in the directory where flashplayer was extracted?  for example lets say you extracted it to your desktop and the folder is called "flashplayer"  you would want to type. cd /home/username/Desktop/flashplayer
2007-02-10T15:10:00.000Z	oggie	jason__	im in there...here's what i got
2007-02-10T15:11:00.000Z	oggie	jason__	sorry to hear that..is there none i can do?
2007-02-10T15:12:00.000Z	jason__	oggie	Ok then your running on 64bit, you have 3 options. #1 Fire off an angry letter to adobe saying that your another one of the many many people who are getting sick of waiting on them to support 64Bit, option#2 Install a 32bit version of ubuntu instead of the 64bit, Option #3 Find a tutorial on running your browser and flash in a 32bit chrooted environment
2007-02-10T15:12:00.000Z	oggie	jason__	thank you jason..btw..can you run MS window application while on ubuntu?>
