2008-08-08T03:13:00.000Z	rooroo82		Hmm how could I get my program to create a new command on ubuntu?
2008-08-08T03:13:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	say again?
2008-08-08T03:14:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	you need to put it into a directory that the $PATH variable lists. "echo $PATH". i suggest /usr/local/bin.
2008-08-08T03:14:00.000Z	rooroo82	TiredWolf	so physically put the script there?
2008-08-08T03:14:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	you also need to have #!/usr/bin/ruby as the first line of your program, and make it executable using chmod +x filename.
2008-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	yes, of course. the system doesn't look for commands in every conceivable directory in your filesystem... only in /sbin, /bin, /usr/bin, and a couple of others (all listed if you type echo $PATH).
2008-08-08T03:15:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	why would you create a .sh file, if your program is a ruby script?
2008-08-08T03:16:00.000Z	rooroo82	TiredWolf	I was reading Clint-'s reply too
2008-08-08T03:16:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	i mean, you can give it the file extension you want (including none), but ".sh" is generally used for shell scripts
2008-08-08T03:17:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	well, is i read that correctly, Clint- is wrong. you definitely don't need to make a separate script to *start* your program, your program is perfectly capable of starting itself.
2008-08-08T03:19:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/filename
2008-08-08T03:19:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	and then make sure the line #!/usr/bin/ruby is the first line in your program.
2008-08-08T03:20:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	now type the command name.
2008-08-08T03:23:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	i don't understand what's the problem with it taking input.
2008-08-08T03:24:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	you're merely running your Ruby program, no more no less. what did you instead want to achieve?
2008-08-08T03:25:00.000Z	rooroo82	TiredWolf	type something like "Moomake" and my ruby script would start
2008-08-08T03:25:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	and it does, provided you called your script's filename "/usr/local/bin/Moomake"
2008-08-08T03:26:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	extensions are ignored in Linux
2008-08-08T03:26:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	if you put one there, though, you'll have to always put it there.
2008-08-08T03:26:00.000Z	rooroo82	TiredWolf	yeah
2008-08-08T03:27:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	define "every system"
2008-08-08T03:27:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	yes, you'd have to make a package. ubuntu packages are .deb.
2008-08-08T03:29:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	a bit. but it's much easier for a ruby script. except you have to find out which, of all the 200 pages of stuff you need to read into, is relevant to a Ruby program.
2008-08-08T03:30:00.000Z	TiredWolf	rooroo82	you might want to look at the transcripts of the Open Week classes, the Packaging 101 class explains things in a bit more humane a manner.
