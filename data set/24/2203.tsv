2010-05-06T02:25:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	same thing I just wrote to erUSUL
2010-05-06T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	grab the alternate ISO and upgrade with that
2010-05-06T02:32:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	unfortunately no working CD-rom in this computer
2010-05-06T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	not necessary, you can mount the iso on the HDD :)
2010-05-06T02:33:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	might try that, just let me go one more with erUSUL
2011-05-15T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	alsamixer is a GUI
2011-05-15T10:50:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	is there something I can use within Gnome instead of in Terminal
2011-05-15T10:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	looks something like this: http://linuxfocus.org/common/images/article259/alsamixer.gif
2011-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	mine doesn't look like that...
2011-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	thats a standard alsamixer display
2011-05-15T10:53:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	well mine is broken, it has a lot of black spaces, nothing is listed
2011-05-15T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	what is the output of:  lsb_release -d
2011-05-15T10:54:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS
2011-05-15T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	try: http://monespaceperso.org/blog-en/2010/05/02/upgrade-alsa-1-0-23-on-ubuntu-lucid-lynx-10-04/
2011-06-05T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	possibly ~/.bluez or ~/.config  someplace
2011-06-05T15:17:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	nope neither
2011-06-05T15:18:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	if I recall correctly you've helped me in the past.
2011-06-05T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	i help many
2011-06-05T15:20:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	I found it in .gconf/apps
2011-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	skiwithpete	ActionParsnip	nope that actually failed - though I renamed the directory, the configuration setting appeared before Bluez crashed
2011-06-05T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	I don't use bluetooth myself so not sure on the config folder really
2011-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skiwithpete	sounds like you need a package then
