2005-10-13T16:21:00.000Z	DeepB		hi there, how /var/cache/apt/available can be rebuilt if 'apt-get update' does not do its job?
2005-10-13T16:22:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	can't you just rerun apt-get update?
2005-10-13T16:23:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	i'm telling you apt-get update does *not* work ;)
2005-10-13T16:23:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	Oh. What error you are getting?
2005-10-13T16:24:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	i get no no error, it says rebuilding the file at the end, but it won't
2005-10-13T16:24:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	and you know that it doesn't rebuild by how?
2005-10-13T16:25:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	by having *not* that file no longer
2005-10-13T16:25:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	yeah. I guess that does mean it :)
2005-10-13T16:26:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	well I don't have that file either. Doesn't apt-get no longer work?
2005-10-13T16:27:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	exactly that, i get "E: The package index files are corrupted. No Filename: field for package whatever"
2005-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	I have archives -directory, pkgcache.bin (6.3M), srcpkgcache.bin (6.1M) in /var/cache/apt. You don't have that pkgcache.bin?
2005-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	yes, i have both
2005-10-13T16:29:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	are you using breezy or hoary?
2005-10-13T16:29:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	and those are rebuilt just fine with update
2005-10-13T16:29:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	breezy here
2005-10-13T16:30:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	That is interesting. Do you have any extra repositories installed that aren't in normal installation?
2005-10-13T16:31:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	oh, sorry, i think i found the problem, one of the packages suffers from a bug on packaging itself
2005-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	yeah. Which one?
2005-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	but still, i'm coming from debian... is there no more 'available' file for apt no more?
2005-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	hwtools
2005-10-13T16:33:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	it would seem that no. I don't know about these things really :)
2005-10-13T16:34:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	ok, thx anyway
2005-10-13T16:35:00.000Z	tommi^	DeepB	hwtools is in normal breezy installation.. hmm. You should think about filing a bug report.
2005-10-13T16:36:00.000Z	DeepB	tommi^	thx for the tip, but i think i might pin it, since the broken one is coming from an external repo, ubuntu is not to blame this time :)
