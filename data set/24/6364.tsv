2007-01-14T11:13:00.000Z	ubuntu		I am having trouble setting my resolution to 1360x768. 1360x768 is listed as a resolution in xorg.conf but I cant select it in the menus. I have a ATI X300. I have tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg without any luck. Does anyone have a solution?
2007-01-14T11:15:00.000Z	ubuntu		no, before I used a regular monitor but now I am using a 37 inch widescreen tv and it is not giving me any widescreen resolutions to use.
2007-01-14T11:16:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	You need to detect the supported resolutions then add them to the configuration in xorg.conf
2007-01-14T11:17:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	can you show me your config?
2007-01-14T11:22:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	how do you want me to send you the xorg.conf
2007-01-14T11:24:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	email me doctormo [at]  gmail.com
2007-01-14T11:30:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	the horz/vert Hz is that required?
2007-01-14T11:33:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	but it's a flatscreen right?
2007-01-14T11:33:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	then I fail to see why those settings are needed
2007-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	they're CRT settings
2007-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	comment them out
2007-01-14T11:38:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	that didn't work. it still doesn't give me any widescreen resolutions.
2007-01-14T11:38:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	you'll also have to find out what resolutions are supported by your graphics card
2007-01-14T11:39:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	where at?
2007-01-14T11:39:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	it worked in windows.
2007-01-14T11:40:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	can you email me your x11 error log? /var/log/X11.log.0
2007-01-14T11:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	i will send you the Xorg.O.log
2007-01-14T11:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	i sent the log file to you
2007-01-14T11:49:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	according to your logs, your card has errors loading the ati drivers and it tries to detect the cards supported modes and it fails
2007-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	do i need to use the ati drivers then?
2007-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	er, your not at thre moment?
2007-01-14T11:51:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	not the official ones from the ati website just the ones ubuntu preloads
2007-01-14T11:51:00.000Z	doctormo	ubuntu	then yes, probably.
2007-01-14T11:52:00.000Z	ubuntu	doctormo	okay then i will try that
