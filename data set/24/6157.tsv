2012-11-20T23:43:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		but thats a different distro and might have been a different driver
2012-11-20T23:44:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		ubuntu is pretty good with support on most usb devices but if it isnt listed as suported, well you know....

2012-11-20T23:49:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		iam not seeing drivers pop right up for those printers Powertux
2012-11-20T23:50:00.000Z	MrELusiveness		Vivid i was talking about the current patch of ddo and how the app data base has no info on it yet
2012-11-20T23:51:00.000Z	vivid	MrELusiveness	the appdb relies on users to submit data.  ddo is not an extremely popular game, thus its likely nobody has played/submitted information
2012-11-20T23:51:00.000Z	vivid		however, you can submit test data if you like
2012-11-20T23:51:00.000Z	MrELusiveness	PowerTux	yeah it maybe that you are using well ending up with a diffrent drive other than what would run it better
