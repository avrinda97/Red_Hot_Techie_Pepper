2008-03-04T09:27:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Hey I'm trying to migrate my Ubuntu home server to another computer. The new computer has a raid array. If I just copy the entire contents of my previous installation onto a new installation on the raided hard drives... will that work?
2008-03-04T09:27:00.000Z	nhlinux	ShadowApex	it should sorta work. How are you going to transfer the data from one drive to the RAID array?
2008-03-04T09:28:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	it has 1 ide channel so I was going to hook it up, mount them both from a live cd and transfer
2008-03-04T09:28:00.000Z	nhlinux		are you going to dd from one drive to the other?
2008-03-04T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Fryguy: it's hardware raid, not fake raid. my new installation of Ubuntu on the new server boots flawlessly with RAID5
2008-03-04T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	dd?
2008-03-04T09:29:00.000Z	nhlinux		dd is a UNIX command to copy raw data from device to another
2008-03-04T09:29:00.000Z	nhlinux		it's like ghost
2008-03-04T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Fryguy: hmm... I guess the worst that could happen is that I just reinstall
2008-03-04T09:30:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	ahh... i was just going to cp -r /media/hda1
2008-03-04T09:30:00.000Z	nhlinux		example... dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/sda
2008-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	nhlinux		In that example, I just imaged the old drive to my RAID array
2008-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Fryguy/nhlinux: Could I just use gparted and cpoy the entire partition to the raid array?
2008-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	nhlinux		nope
2008-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	nhlinux		gparted won't do that
2008-03-04T09:32:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	why? When I run "fdisk -l" I see the entire RAID array as 1 hard drive
2008-03-04T09:32:00.000Z	nhlinux		if you want to replicate the contents of the original drive (including the boot sector and partition table) to your RAID array, dd is the command to use.
2008-03-04T09:33:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Fryguy: You can copy partitions to another disk in gparted
2008-03-04T09:33:00.000Z	nhlinux		I've never seen that featyre before
2008-03-04T09:34:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	ok, so if I use dd; what would be the syntax to that? Say my RAID array is /dev/sda1 and my old hdd is /dev/hda1
2008-03-04T09:35:00.000Z	nhlinux		dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/sda (if you want to copy from sector 0 to the very last sector of /dev/hda, the first drive).
2008-03-04T09:35:00.000Z	ShadowApex	nhlinux	ok thanks. I'll go ahead and try that now
2008-03-04T09:35:00.000Z	ShadowApex		I'll let you know if it works ;D
2008-03-04T09:36:00.000Z	nhlinux	ShadowApex	/sbin/dumpe2fs works as well.
