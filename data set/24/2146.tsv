2009-03-29T23:55:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	did you try audacious and exaile?
2009-03-29T23:56:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	tried exaile, but just like daftyskins dont like the way it display the music in just 1 list
2009-03-29T23:56:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	what you mean by "in just 1 list"?
2009-03-29T23:56:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	i mean you could make multiple playlists and such
2009-03-29T23:57:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	talking more about the way it organises your library, I'll be getting audacious and give it a try
2009-03-29T23:57:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	well probably what you want is something like amarok or itunes...
2009-03-29T23:57:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	winamp is the keyword.
2009-03-29T23:58:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	on windows i use winamp to just play single files i want to doubleclick and foobar2000 for larger playlists
2009-03-29T23:58:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	I don't use windows anymore ^^
2009-03-29T23:58:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	foobar seems to be damn good
2009-03-29T23:58:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	well i'm a musician and it's mostly impossible to make music without it
2009-03-29T23:59:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	^^
2009-03-29T23:59:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	tho i'm using ubuntu on my work box and on my netbook
2009-03-29T23:59:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	OSX?
2009-03-29T23:59:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	i'd rather stop making music before using osx.
2009-03-29T23:59:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	really? xD
2009-03-30T00:00:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	if it would run on my usual hardware i'd probably use osx
2009-03-30T00:00:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	it does not
2009-03-30T00:00:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	and yeah i thought about a hackintosh
2009-03-30T00:01:00.000Z	bassliner	chotaz	however, the apple hardware just isn't worth the money
2009-03-30T00:01:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	sooo tru.
2009-03-30T00:02:00.000Z	chotaz	bassliner	I copied over 5GB of music from a DVD to my Music folder but every track as a lock near the icon?
