2008-03-30T01:00:00.000Z	calamari		is there a way to have synaptic show both i386 and amd64 packages?  I have some of each installed, via --force-architecture
2008-03-30T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	although it seems like a very bad idea to me
2008-03-30T01:00:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	ubuntu is not setup to be multi lib
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	sometimes needed when 64bit packages aren't available
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	yes, but ubuntu isn't setup multi lib
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	ehh.. it has some 32 bit support packages
2008-03-30T01:01:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	it works fine.. just trying to view everything
2008-03-30T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	no, you need a base set of 32bit libs to use 32bit libraries, which maintaining can be quite complex
2008-03-30T01:02:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	yes.. ubuntu provides those
2008-03-30T01:03:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	anyways.. sounds like synaptic doesn't handle it ..
2008-03-30T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	try putting both the 32bit and 64bit repo's in, I'm not sure how that would work out
2008-03-30T01:03:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	yeah.. not sure either.. but I can always take em back out if I need to.. thanks
2008-03-30T01:04:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	actually wait.. there are no differences in the repo names
2008-03-30T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	ahhh it's doen on your !arch now rather than repo name
2008-03-30T01:05:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	what is !arch?
2008-03-30T01:05:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	your machine architechture
2008-03-30T01:06:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	not finding !arch anywhere
2008-03-30T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	sorry, that was miss-leading, you won't find it as an option
2008-03-30T01:06:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	the repo's contents are determained by your machines arch x86_64, i386 etc
2008-03-30T01:07:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	oh.. I see what you're saying
2008-03-30T01:07:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	I'll mess around with that.. thanks
2008-03-30T01:09:00.000Z	calamari	ikonia	lol.. ehh duh.. I'd need a 32-bit synaptic for this to work.. okay I need to mess around with this some more.. thanks I think you've pointed me in the right direction
2008-03-30T01:09:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	no problem
2008-03-30T01:10:00.000Z	ikonia	calamari	I've never done it that way, I'd expect 32bit compatability packages that are SUPPORTED (key word) being held in the amd64 repo
