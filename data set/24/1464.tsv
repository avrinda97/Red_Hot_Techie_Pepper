2010-01-03T16:31:00.000Z	minimec	maffelu	What king af GPU are you using, what kind of 'pixly and stuff' are you seeing on your screen?

2010-01-03T16:36:00.000Z	minimec	maffelu	Can you open a console and paste.ubuntu.com/ the output of 'lspci' and another paste for the output of 'dmesg'?

2010-01-03T16:38:00.000Z	minimec	maffelu	Ok. Let us wait until the installation is finished. Maybe you were shouting too soon ;)
2010-01-03T16:39:00.000Z	minimec	maffelu	OK.
2010-01-03T17:26:00.000Z	minimec	maffelu	I see, you still have your problem. Can you open a console and paste.ubuntu.com/ the output of 'lspci' and another paste  for the output of 'dmesg'?
2010-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	maffelu	minimec	I have no internet on that computer, is there something I should look for?
