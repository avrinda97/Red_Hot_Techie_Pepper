2008-05-15T23:23:00.000Z	Soopa		hey gang
2008-05-15T23:24:00.000Z	Soopa		I just added a new hard drive (that was liberated from an old iMac) to this Ubuntu box... can someone point me to a tutorial on how to format/use the new drive?
2008-05-15T23:25:00.000Z	Soopa		I'm using Ubuntu server
2008-05-15T23:25:00.000Z	Soopa		so I'll need to do it on the command line
2008-05-15T23:26:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	sudo cfdisk /dev/<hd>
2008-05-15T23:27:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	how do I know the name of the hd?
2008-05-15T23:27:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	reasoning and guesswork :)
2008-05-15T23:29:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	basically, all IDE disks get names hda hdb hdc hdd and so on. sata and scsi get sda sdb sdc sdd and so on. Partitions are the numbers after. So /dev/sda1 is the first partition on the first sata/scsi disk.
2008-05-15T23:31:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	hmm.. these are IDE drives.. I see /dev/sda1 (that's the master drive, I think) but no /dev/hd*
2008-05-15T23:31:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	check dmesg. "dmesg | less" should show everything that have happened since startup, including all disk initialization
2008-05-15T23:47:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	aha, it's /dev/sdb, i think
2008-05-15T23:48:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	to be certain, check "mount" for what's already used :)
2008-05-15T23:48:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	okay.. what am I looking for?
2008-05-15T23:49:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	mount shows you what hd's and partitions the system is already using. If sdb is in that list, it's probably not the new drive :p
2008-05-15T23:50:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	ah, I see.. no, it's not in the list
2008-05-15T23:50:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	to format, use mkfs.<fs> /dev/<hd><partition>
2008-05-15T23:50:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	the usual format is ext3
2008-05-15T23:51:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	ok.. cool, /dev/sda1 is ext3, so I'll go with that..
2008-05-15T23:51:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	so what should the partition be?  1?
2008-05-15T23:52:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	if there is only 1 partition, then yes. it's 1. cfdisk should have told you what number the partitions are (and let you create new table / partition if its not recognized)
2008-05-15T23:54:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	I don't want to boot from it.. does that matter?
2008-05-15T23:55:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	mostly I just want to format it and move /home to it
2008-05-15T23:55:00.000Z	Terrasque	Soopa	you won't boot from it. The boot flag thingy is some old msdos thing :p
2008-05-15T23:56:00.000Z	Soopa	Terrasque	hehe, okay, thanks
