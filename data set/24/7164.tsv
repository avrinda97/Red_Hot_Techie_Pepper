2005-04-09T15:12:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	specify them as separate flags.
2005-04-09T15:12:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	"-t ext -o loop"
2005-04-09T15:12:00.000Z	Marble2	Flonne	Okay, that gives me
2005-04-12T07:43:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	what was your install command?
2005-04-12T07:46:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	/dev/hda4 is a block device. -o bind expects a directory.
2005-04-12T07:47:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	no.
2005-04-12T07:47:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	now you chroot in, but wait for robertj to confirm it.
2005-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	/mnt/mypartition/
2005-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	do you see a "grub>"-like prompt?
2005-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	does that make sense?
2005-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	do you have a separate /boot/ partition?
2005-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	how did you create it? If you let the Ubuntu installer take care of it, then it should be used.
2005-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	"root (hd0,2)" where 0,2 is replaced by your boot partition.
2005-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	it should tell you what type of filesystem it is.
2005-04-12T08:09:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	su/sudo to root first.
2005-04-12T08:10:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	do you have two harddrives?
2005-04-12T08:10:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	what's on the others?
2005-04-12T08:11:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	run "fdisk -l /dev/hd[bc] " (don't show us the contents unless there are Linux drives there)
2005-04-12T08:12:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	it looks as though your Ubuntu installation has been overwritten...
2005-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	Linux/swap doesn't actually contain real data, unless I'm horribly mistaken.
2005-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	I... guess we can try, but this is a very unusal setup, so I can't make any promises. :(
2005-04-12T08:16:00.000Z	Marble2	Flonne	so what do I do?
2005-04-12T08:16:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	okay, chroot in with the other terminal (no mounting required), and `ls /boot/` -- see if it lists anything like "vmlinuz".
2005-04-12T08:18:00.000Z	Flonne	Marble2	can you PM me the contents of /etc/fstab? (use the non-grub chroot)
