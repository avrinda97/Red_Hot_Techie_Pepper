2006-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	have you tried changing your resolution?
2006-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	system->preferences->screen resolution?
2006-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	lindsay	paradizelost	 yes
2006-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	and what all do you have for choices there?
2006-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	lindsay	paradizelost	it fixes the problem if it gets smaller like 600x800
2006-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	lindsay	paradizelost	 600x800 up to 1200x800
2006-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	as in you set the resolution higher?
2006-05-18T05:39:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	LCD screens have what's called "Native Resolutions", a setting at which any below you go, the quality gets worse
2006-05-18T05:39:00.000Z	lindsay	paradizelost	when it's 1280x800 it's messed up, if i drop to 600x800 it looks smooth
2006-05-18T05:40:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	k.  when you have it at the 1280x800 what is the frequency?
2006-05-18T05:42:00.000Z	paradizelost	lindsay	i can't find anything, and it's been a LONG time since i've done anything w/ intel drivers
