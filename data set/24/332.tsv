2012-04-17T15:20:00.000Z	serialk		hello, i've got a problem since I tried to upgrade to 11.10
2012-04-17T15:21:00.000Z	serialk		my X server doesn't start
2012-04-17T15:21:00.000Z	serialk		when I try to startx it says 'module nvidia_current_updates not found'
2012-04-17T15:21:00.000Z	serialk		and 'no screens found'
2012-04-17T15:22:00.000Z	serialk		It works when I remove my xorg.conf but without the drivers, and when I try to do nvidia-xconfig i have the same problem
2012-04-17T15:23:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	how did you install the driver and what nvidia chip are you using?
2012-04-17T15:24:00.000Z	serialk		I installed it a loooong time ago, it happend when I did the upgrade
2012-04-17T15:25:00.000Z	serialk		GT216
2012-04-17T15:25:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	did you upgrade in the same release, or to the next release?
2012-04-17T15:25:00.000Z	serialk		to the next release
2012-04-17T15:25:00.000Z	serialk		my card is nVidia GT216
2012-04-17T15:25:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	so what release do you have now?
2012-04-17T15:26:00.000Z	serialk		the last one, 11.10
2012-04-17T15:26:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	I suggest you remove the driver and boot to the desktop, then reinstall it
2012-04-17T15:27:00.000Z	serialk		okay.
2012-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	serialk	ActionPa1snip	the driver assistant says the installation has failed
2012-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	serialk		and in jockey.log I got this :
2012-04-17T15:44:00.000Z	serialk		2012-04-17 13:43:20,617 WARNING: modinfo for module nvidia_current_updates failed: ERROR: modinfo: could not find module nvidia_current_updates
2012-04-17T15:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	run:   sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
2012-04-17T15:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	much easier than that GUI thing
2012-04-17T15:48:00.000Z	serialk	ActionPa1snip	nvidia-current is already installed
2012-04-17T15:48:00.000Z	serialk		(but I removed it just before â€¦)
2012-04-17T15:49:00.000Z	serialk		nVidia GT216
2012-04-17T15:50:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	serialk	then you need to uninstall that to
