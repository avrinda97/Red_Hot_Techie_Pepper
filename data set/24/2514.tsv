2012-10-13T01:33:00.000Z	kulitorum		I added modes "1280x1024" to my xorg.conf, but I still can only select 640x480 in displays. How can I force higher resolution? (there's no resolutions listed under "Monitor" should there be?)
2012-10-13T01:33:00.000Z	pepee	kulitorum	in the console use xrandr
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		xrandr lists 640x480 and 320x240
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		Quadro 4600
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		..or maybe 4700
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		It worked fine on another 1920x1200 monitor, but this one is connected with a 15pin d-sub
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		 NVIDIA Corporation G80 [Quadro FX 4600] (rev a2)
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		so I guess there's no data communication
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		That also only lists 640x480
2012-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	kulitorum		Should xorg.conf have resolutions under the "monitor" section?
2012-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	kulitorum		Probably not
2012-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	kulitorum		it's hard in 640x480 :) - what should I search for?
2012-10-13T01:37:00.000Z	kulitorum	TJ-	Check, that's there. Looks resonable
2012-10-13T01:38:00.000Z	kulitorum		 (WW) NVIDIA(GPU-0): Unable to read EDID for display device CRT-1
2012-10-13T01:38:00.000Z	kulitorum		Can I force the resolution?
2012-10-13T01:39:00.000Z	kulitorum		    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0
2012-10-13T01:39:00.000Z	kulitorum		    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0
2012-10-13T01:42:00.000Z	kulitorum		I just want one resolution, 1920x1080
2012-10-13T01:43:00.000Z	pepee	kulitorum	ask in #nvidia too
2012-10-13T01:43:00.000Z	kulitorum		Hmmmm, It's not a monitor per-se - it's a panel that's used as a display in an airport terminal. So it don't have any real specifications :
2012-10-13T01:43:00.000Z	kulitorum		:)
2012-10-13T01:44:00.000Z	kulitorum		and vert?
2012-10-13T01:44:00.000Z	kulitorum		...expected, that is :)
2012-10-13T01:44:00.000Z	pepee	kulitorum	tried removing xorg.conf? AFAIK it's not needed these days
