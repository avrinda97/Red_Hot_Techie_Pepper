2005-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	do you want it to automatically mount at startup? or just mount it now?
2005-08-02T05:19:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	( look up ^ ) and replace /mnt/c with wherever you want to mount the partition
2005-08-02T05:20:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	you will also need to sudo mkdir /mnt/c, and change permissions/ownerships if you want them to be different to defaults
2005-08-02T05:21:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	sorry :)
2005-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	what else have you put on the line with /dev/hda1 /mnt/Drive1 ?
2005-08-02T05:24:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	you need to specify the type (vfat), and other options, and put two 0s at the end of the line (follow the layout of the rest of the file)
2005-08-02T05:27:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	put in 'defaults' under options too
2005-08-02T05:27:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	now sudo mount -a should work
2005-08-02T05:28:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	the type is vfat, not fat32
2005-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	do you mean it's a logical volume inside an extended partition?
2005-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	or have you just created an extended partition?
2005-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	does the line exactly match the one for /dev/hda1 apart from the first two sections?
2005-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	*in fstab
2005-08-02T06:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	russ_	the desktop is part of nautilus
