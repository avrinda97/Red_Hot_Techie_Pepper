2010-10-20T14:20:00.000Z	Boogieman		you have to highlight that partition and set for ex / as a mount point
2010-10-20T14:21:00.000Z	Boogieman		you chose manual partition setup right?
2010-10-20T14:22:00.000Z	jakewc2	Boogieman	is that a message for me, I am not sure what you mena. I did highlight, but dont know what setting ex for mount point means
2010-10-20T14:22:00.000Z	jakewc2		how do I do that
2010-10-20T14:23:00.000Z	Boogieman		<jakewc2>when you choose manual partition setup, highlight the old partition where ubuntu was. then i think you click on edit and set the mountpoint. i just chose / there.
2010-10-20T14:24:00.000Z	Boogieman		for example you could set / as mount point. or if you had different root and home the tell it wich [artitions are the root and /home
2010-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	jakewc2		one sec I'll take a pic, and show it to you
2010-10-20T14:25:00.000Z	Boogieman		highlight the old ubuntu partition and click edit. tell it to use / as mount point. then click ok and next or whatever
2010-10-20T14:26:00.000Z	Boogieman		boot the recovery console listen under your main kernel in your grub2 list and there is a repair packages option there
2010-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	jakewc2		 ok, I tried to tick on the ext4 partition, and I get an error saying 'No root File System, please correct this from partitioning menu' Can you tell me what that means please
2010-10-20T14:27:00.000Z	jakewc2		tried to take a screen shot but wouldnt let me
2010-10-20T14:28:00.000Z	Boogieman		try deleting it. then make a new ext4 partition there. and make it ext4 if you want
2010-10-20T14:28:00.000Z	jakewc2		that womt work, tried it already, catestrophic error, nothing boots up, which is why I have to do a fresh install
2010-10-20T14:29:00.000Z	Boogieman		sounds like there is just an ext4 partition thats boogered up there. use the partition manager to format it
2010-10-20T14:29:00.000Z	jakewc2		what does it mean when it says 'no root filesystem'
2010-10-20T14:30:00.000Z	Boogieman		use the live cd and gparted. delete that ext4 old ubuntu partition and make a new one

2010-10-20T14:33:00.000Z	Boogieman	jakewc2	see the part that says : ummm...theres somewhere it asks you about which partitions to mount where, in a list.... you should make sure the partition3 where you want to install linux is marked '/' instead of being something else....
2010-10-20T14:34:00.000Z	jakewc2		ok, dont know what I did but had to change somethign, when I deleted it, then I actually found the / to start, and its now copying files. That is so confusing.
2010-10-20T14:35:00.000Z	Boogieman		I deleted the partition that i want to install, then i restart the install and select "use continous free space".
2010-10-20T14:35:00.000Z	Boogieman		Then it worked me.
2010-10-20T14:35:00.000Z	Boogieman		Thanks to Galileon for this tip.
2010-10-20T14:36:00.000Z	jakewc2		well, at the moment it is installing Ubuntu, hopefully it will work.
2010-10-20T14:39:00.000Z	Boogieman	jakewc2	good job
