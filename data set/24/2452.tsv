2008-12-20T12:34:00.000Z	derklempner		Argh.  I cannot get a share auto-mounted using fstab.  I have been reading about it for an hour now, and it's just not working.
2008-12-20T12:34:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 theres not spaces in the share name is there?
2008-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	No, there aren't.
2008-12-20T12:35:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 and whats the fstab line entry look like? what messages appear when you try to mount it?
2008-12-20T12:36:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 the 'samba-doc' package has some docs on samba that also give troubleshooting information that may be handy
2008-12-20T12:36:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	//server/av-stuff /av-stuff smbfs credentials=/etc/.smbcred 0 0
2008-12-20T12:37:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 the 'server' is pingable by the server name from the command line? on some of my simple lans. I ahve to use the ip# - not the server name.. or edit the /etc/hosts file to  match up server name and ip# properly
2008-12-20T12:37:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	Should be, I have the name in the hosts file.  Let me try...
2008-12-20T12:38:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 i fought for ages once.. and discoverdd a typo  in my hosts file. :(
2008-12-20T12:38:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	Yes, it is fine using the host name.  I can ping the computer.
2008-12-20T12:39:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 try connecting via the command line tools perhaps?  Been ages since ive done that..
2008-12-20T12:41:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	Do I need to change the //server/av-stuff in fstab to read smb://server/av-stuff instead?
2008-12-20T12:43:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 the use of smb:// is used by the FILE MANAGERS  much like how http:// is used.. its not for fstab entries
2008-12-20T12:44:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 check that using-samba docs for examples, and trobulshooting tips.. or find some other examples on various samba web sites I guess
2008-12-20T12:44:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	I figured as much, just wanted to be certain.  Beyond (perhaps) file permissions and ownership, I can't understand why it won't mount it, though.
2008-12-20T12:45:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 enable samba logging - and check the logs and trouble shoot.. Its maybe some very trivial typo or other quirk
2008-12-20T12:45:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	I'd be happy to do so, but I don't know how.  I'm a semi-newb.  =(
2008-12-20T12:48:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	How do I enable logging for Samba?
2008-12-20T12:49:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 its int he smb.conf file somewhere.
2008-12-20T12:49:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	Okay, thanks.  I'll take a gander...
2008-12-20T12:49:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 'samba-doc' package also :)
2008-12-20T12:51:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	LOL, I don't even know where to find the samba.conf file...
2008-12-20T12:51:00.000Z	willis__	derklempner	 I think its VERY good time to install samba-doc and read the using-samba book a little. its in /etc/samba
2008-12-20T12:54:00.000Z	derklempner	willis__	I was looking for the wrong file name, that's why I couldn't find it.  >.<  Nothing concerning the failed attempt to mount the share is listed.  As a matter of fact, nothing from today is listed in the file.
