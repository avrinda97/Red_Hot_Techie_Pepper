2011-06-14T03:20:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	correct
2011-06-14T03:20:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	I suppose it is concievable. Does the dvd read properly in other devices?
2011-06-14T03:21:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	It reads properly in the same PC and a windows PC
2011-06-14T03:22:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	Ok, have you checked online to see if your dvd player requires data disks in a specific format and/or hierarchy?
2011-06-14T03:23:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	They won't be specific. They claim to support every disc type, and the MP4 files are generated by an ffmpeg/x264 I've compiled and scripted myself. High profile, "a few b-frames". I know the mp4 files are good.
2011-06-14T03:24:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	Ok. So when you burned it did you tell it to close the disk?
2011-06-14T03:24:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	That's the thing. I can't see how to see it to do so
2011-06-14T03:24:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	I don't recall setting any such option either way, but this Ubuntu install has been going since '09
2011-06-14T03:27:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	Do you remember seeing an option that said "leave open" with a checkbox?
2011-06-14T03:27:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	Oh jeez, now you're getting technical.
2011-06-14T03:28:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	I'm a PHP programmer, I can't deal with this level of detail
2011-06-14T03:29:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	hehe
2011-06-14T03:32:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	Right up to the final burn dialog, there are no "close" or "not close" related options. I'm somewhat familiar with the standards and filesystems, multi-session etc options. I see none.
2011-06-14T03:33:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	So I wonder if Brasero by default uses different settings, it's iso9660+joliet from memory, as standard?
2011-06-14T03:39:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	Sorry, perils of computering outside. Bird just crapped on my laptop...
2011-06-14T03:39:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	LOL that's pretty epic.
2011-06-14T03:44:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	Can you suggest a DVD creator that has advanced options? I only require data DVDs and RW blanking.
2011-06-14T03:46:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	lol
2011-06-14T03:46:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	I have heard good things of k3b. Brasero has worked fine for me.
2011-06-14T03:47:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	I'll try it too, thanks and good night. Also, good luck with the laptop.
2011-06-14T03:47:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	But I've never needed many of the more advanced options.
2011-06-14T03:47:00.000Z	rationalOgre	computerx	Oh it's cleaned up now.
2011-06-14T03:47:00.000Z	computerx	rationalOgre	Perhaps, but I'll remember you for it ;)
