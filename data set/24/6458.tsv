2006-04-21T12:49:00.000Z	Centaur5		I can't get into a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1, how can I fix that?
2006-04-21T12:49:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	in what context are you experiencing this problem?
2006-04-21T12:51:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	so X has failed and you are without a gui?
2006-04-21T12:52:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	hmmm..I wonder whether unistalling xgl has taken your vterms with it
2006-04-21T12:53:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Actually now that I think about it I couldn't get into a vterm when I had XGL installed.
2006-04-21T12:53:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	do you think you might be able to get to recovery mode?
2006-04-21T12:53:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Until I crashed X by uninstalling it and had no other way to login  :)
2006-04-21T12:54:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Recovery mode? Off the boot cd?
2006-04-21T12:54:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	usually through the grub menu choices
2006-04-21T12:54:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	I probably can
2006-04-21T12:54:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	there is usually a kernel option with '(recovery mode)' written after it
2006-04-21T12:55:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	it will drop you to a root prompt
2006-04-21T12:55:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Okay, what will I need to do from there?
2006-04-21T12:55:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	attempt to reinstall the drivers
2006-04-21T12:55:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	or reconfigure xorg to use vesa drivers or something like that
2006-04-21T12:56:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Okay, well do you think that it's a possibility that the key shortcuts have been modified and that's why I can't get into a vterm?
2006-04-21T12:56:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	quite possible I suppose, but I couldnt say with any certitude
2006-04-21T12:57:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Cause it's kind of strange that Alt+left arrow key doesn't work anymore in firefox to go back a page
2006-04-21T12:59:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Is there a way to adjust the key shortcuts like that?  I didn't see anything under System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
2006-04-21T13:02:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Thanks for the help, I'll reinstall those drivers and call it good.
2006-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	Thanks, recovery mode worked perfect now I'm going to configure xorg.conf to work with both my video cards.
2006-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	good luck :)
2006-04-21T13:20:00.000Z	Centaur5	mustard5	I'm excited  :)
2006-04-21T13:21:00.000Z	mustard5	Centaur5	make a backup of your working xorg.conf ;)
