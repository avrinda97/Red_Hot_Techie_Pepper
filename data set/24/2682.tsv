2009-07-22T08:34:00.000Z	Daps		Can anyone tell me the benefits of installing a proxy server on my machine? and what distro would you recommend??
2009-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 normally one connects to a proxy.. you planning on having other machines connect to that one? If not - not much need for a proxy on a single machine.
2009-07-22T08:36:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	I was told that its a good way to secure my identity when posting on forums.
2009-07-22T08:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 that makes very little sence..
2009-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 if you want to use a proxy then do so.. but running the proxy on the same machine yoy are using. makes no sence to me as being any more 'secure'
2009-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	  if you want to be truely paranoid. theres the 'TOR' security proxy system. but thats a bit overkill
2009-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	hahaha, I don't know, its what i read today, something to do with IP masking of some sort as others can see your IP when you post and then run snort or something to get into open ports
2009-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 if you got no services running.. then you got no ports.. they could just be scanning random ip's  and find people easier..
2009-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 if you are behind a router. then most ports will be blocked anyway
2009-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	so how is it that after posting on a forum, another user can obtain my ip without help from the admin..?
2009-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 i would like to see 'proof' that is possible.
2009-07-22T08:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 sounds like a goofed up forum to me.. or a  myth.
2009-07-22T08:41:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	well maybe a goofed up forum, i won't reveal the URL here in public, for the other users safety, but i've seen someone do it... Don't know how they did it... Thought I might ask some brilliant minds here to see who might have insight.
2009-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	the reason I know it was done is because the admin removed the post after about 30 minutes and asked that people not post other persons IPs... :s so i dunno
2009-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 just getting someones ip shouldent be a security issue - i mean they could just start scaning your ip if they saw that..
2009-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	just thought it might be worth my while to figure it out and try to find a way to not let that happen to me in the future
2009-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	ok thanks
2009-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 so do what you want.. i would just not use that forum any more if you consider it a security risk. or use that 'onion router' project for paranoid-level-security to hide your ip
2009-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 a proxy will slow down your  browser.
2009-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 just being here on IRC could be considered a bigger risk then that forum i  imagine.
2009-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	hahaha, thats comforting.. lol
2009-07-22T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 some times it returns your actual ip. some times ya gotta do a little more work to get the ip.
2009-07-22T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Daps	 so as we said. just getting someones ip. is not that huge a security hole.
2009-07-22T08:55:00.000Z	Daps	Dr_willis	thanks
