2012-03-14T15:09:00.000Z	scientes	heizmann	whats ur problem
2012-03-14T15:10:00.000Z	heizmann	scientes	I have a live system on a usb-stick - with persistent-mode, plus casper-rw partition.
2012-03-14T15:10:00.000Z	heizmann		All is fine.
2012-03-14T15:10:00.000Z	scientes		cool
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes		i just made a half-ass attempt to do netboot to livecd
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes		and i think my first try actually worked, it was just slow
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes		but anyways, gone not
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	heizmann		But I wish encrypt my casper-rw partition, with a luks container. :) is it possible?
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes		oh geeze
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes	heizmann	why don't you use ecryptfs instead?
2012-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	scientes		for your home folder
2012-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	scientes		that would be alot easier
2012-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	heizmann	scientes	ecryptfs: works perfectly (with, well, my /home/user repositories)
2012-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	heizmann		I want to try with another method, for testing ^^
2012-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	scientes		yeah, should even work on the livecd if you set it up right
2012-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	scientes		oh geeze....
2012-03-14T15:13:00.000Z	scientes		why don'y you go fix swome bugs
2012-03-14T15:13:00.000Z	scientes		learn some c
2012-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	heizmann	scientes	I think the good method is: 1) encrypt casper-rw with a luks container; 2) chroot in my uncompressed squashfs system; 3) install cryptsetup, hashalot; 4) regenerate initramfs; 5) squash compress
2012-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	scientes	heizmann	have you heard of TRESOR?
2012-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	scientes		sounds like something you would be pretty stoaked by, if you havn't heard of it
2012-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	heizmann	scientes	but I'm not sure... all depends if the initrd.gz regenerate knows a luks container or not...
2012-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	heizmann	scientes	TRESOR? no... what is it?
2012-03-14T15:17:00.000Z	scientes	heizmann	google is ur friend, but tell me if i was right :)))
