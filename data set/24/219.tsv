2012-02-26T21:23:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Well, I assume you have that installed?
2012-02-26T21:17:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Run "autoconf", it will generate a configure script, after that run the configure script, and finally make
2012-02-26T21:23:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	it won't run autoconf for some reason....
2012-02-26T21:24:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	lmfao.. does it come installed when upgrading 11.10?
2012-02-26T21:25:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	I don't think so, no. "sudo apt-get install build-essential flex m4 bison autoconf make" should get you going with essential building tools
2012-02-26T21:26:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	yeah, it's installed already.
2012-02-26T21:26:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Okay, when you cd to the directory where "configure.ac" is and run "autoconf", what is the result?
2012-02-26T21:31:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	ok, i got past that command, now i'm stuck on another one.. this time it's to install the applet. "make: *** No rule to make target 'install'. Stop."
2012-02-26T21:32:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Did you run the configure script after autoconf?
2012-02-26T21:32:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	"sudo apt-get install checkinstall && ./configure && make && sudo checkinstall"
2012-02-26T21:36:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	i'm confused, autoconf won't open, commands don't work and i need a toke.. lol, thanks for the help, i'll look into it later, don't have the patients to figure it out.
2012-02-26T21:39:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	k, good luck
2012-02-26T21:40:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	what i was trying to do, is make my panel bar at the top have a global menu/clock and app indicator.. (i'm using 11.10//gnome classic)
2012-02-26T21:40:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Meh... simpliest way is by using Unity of course >.>
2012-02-26T21:41:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	lol, i'm new to linux.. how do i do that?
2012-02-26T21:41:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Um, Unity is the standard Ubuntu desktop environment (which you decided not to use)
2012-02-26T21:42:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	yes, i'm using a lion os x theme, hence why i'm using gnome classic. the launcher on the left was quite annoying that is why i'm using gnome classic.
2012-02-26T21:42:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	I see.
2012-02-26T21:43:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	Well... good luck, I have no idea what you are actually trying to compile and whether it will even work with gnome3
2012-02-26T21:45:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	lol, alright. thanks anyhow. but uhm, i was basically trying to make my panel look like mac.. :P
2012-02-26T21:45:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	That's kind of disgusting to me, but good luck anyway :P
2012-02-26T21:46:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	ahha, i enjoy it quite much! (friend has mac, use friends computer often, he told me about linux, with mac theme, i now love it to death.
2012-02-26T21:47:00.000Z	okum	theadmin	robin0800, i think i'll just wait untill macbuntu works for 11.10 or something.
2012-02-27T01:20:00.000Z	theadmin	okum	You can't really do that. You can use the Fallback though
