2011-07-04T23:09:00.000Z	kalofoli		as painlessly as possible?
2011-07-04T23:09:00.000Z	kalofoli		update manager does not support 10.04LTS
2011-07-04T23:10:00.000Z	kalofoli		oh...
2011-07-04T23:10:00.000Z	kalofoli		ok
2011-07-04T23:11:00.000Z	kalofoli		ok, I am doing it on my own responsibility,
2011-07-04T23:11:00.000Z	kalofoli		but what chances of success do i have with that? (jaunty->natty-> automatic update to 10.04 )
2011-07-04T23:11:00.000Z	kalofoli		dist-upgrade *
2011-07-04T23:12:00.000Z	kalofoli		i have about 5 mins availlable..
2011-07-04T23:12:00.000Z	kalofoli		I need a package, desperately.
2011-07-04T23:12:00.000Z	kalofoli		namely mercurial, and the repositories of jaunty are all dead
2011-07-04T23:13:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	you can download from packages.ubuntu.com
2011-07-04T23:13:00.000Z	kalofoli	Muelli	so, no need to upgradE?
2011-07-04T23:13:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	dunno what you want to achieve
2011-07-04T23:14:00.000Z	kalofoli	Muelli	can I add this to my repos, at lest temporarilly?
2011-07-04T23:14:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	sorry, I didn't read your initial question hence I don't know what you want to do.
2011-07-04T23:15:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	but generally speaking, you can mix and match packages from several releases, but it's dangerous and not recommended at all. You want to google "apt pinning" first, before you attempt to do any of that
2011-07-04T23:16:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	just download the .debs and dpkg -i them...
2011-07-04T23:16:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	fingers crossed that it won't break anything.
2011-07-04T23:16:00.000Z	kalofoli	Muelli	how about the dependencies?
2011-07-04T23:16:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	it will complain if it doesn't have the necessary deps ;-)
2011-07-04T23:17:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	you could do that. But it's not recommended.
2011-07-04T23:18:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	in fact, that's what the ubuntu upgrade tool would do, but it does more stuff on top
2011-07-04T23:18:00.000Z	kalofoli	Muelli	l see..
2011-07-04T23:20:00.000Z	Muelli	kalofoli	Well. Quite high, but I wouldn't expect any major damage. You probably won't have settings migrated or configuration leftovers that might screw you up. But that's rather easy to handle I'd say.
