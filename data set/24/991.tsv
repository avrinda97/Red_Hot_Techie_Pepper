2012-08-24T13:25:00.000Z	belgianguy		when I log in, the screen is jumbled for a second or so, but then it corrects itself
2012-08-24T13:25:00.000Z	belgianguy		anyone know why this happens?
2012-08-24T13:26:00.000Z	belgianguy		and it's not the total width, about a sqaure size, with a band to the right that isn't jumbled
2012-08-24T13:26:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	I'd guess crappy drivers, but I need the log-files for Xorg to diagnose anything :)
2012-08-24T13:26:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	where would I find those?
2012-08-24T13:26:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	/var/log/Xorg.[0-9].log
2012-08-24T13:27:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	post /var/log/Xorg.0.log on pastebin for example and I'll have a look
2012-08-24T13:27:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	will do, thanks!Âµ
2012-08-24T13:27:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	skip fglrx and rock mesa instead :)
2012-08-24T13:30:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	I wouldn't know what to look for tbh
2012-08-24T13:30:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	please no privs :)
2012-08-24T13:37:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	I can't see any errors. however, you don't have a specific setup so it keeps falling back to defaults and this *might* mess things up if it flips form one mode to the other... I'd suggest setting up a proper xorg.conf with ati's configtool :)
2012-08-24T13:38:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	well I've migrated this install from my old laptop (nvidia)
2012-08-24T13:39:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	that will probably **** all over your xserver config ^^
2012-08-24T13:40:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	did you purge nvidia or just remove it?
2012-08-24T13:41:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	yes, reconfiguring with aticonfig will probably work :)
2012-08-24T13:41:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	don't remember, it's been like this for a while:)
2012-08-24T13:41:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	if you check @ line 118, you'll see the warning :)
2012-08-24T13:43:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	but then again, I havn't used ATI/AMD with anything other than mesa-drivers, so I could be completely wrong... but atleast it work mess up your system :)
2012-08-24T13:43:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	I'm already impressed it still runs, after all I've done to it
2012-08-24T13:44:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	my laptop w/ archlinux was a virtual machine from the start... so If I want to, I could just boot it upp in VirtualBox and it still works just as it should :)
2012-11-27T13:39:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	don't encourage someone to code C++ in Eclipse... it's insane ;P
2012-11-27T13:43:00.000Z	bkc_	belgianguy	seriously thou, don't recommend eclipse for C/C++-development to a beginner...
2012-11-27T13:43:00.000Z	belgianguy	bkc_	why not?
