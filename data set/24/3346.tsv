2008-02-17T16:19:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	'speaker-test -c 6 -D surround51'
2008-02-17T16:19:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	for 5.1 sourround
2008-02-17T16:21:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	because its only stereo ;)
2008-02-17T16:21:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	but it's able to mix it up
2008-02-17T16:22:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	for single files: 'aplay -D upmix /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav'
2008-02-17T16:22:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	or via the 'playback.pcm "upmix"' option in .asoundrc i think
2008-02-17T16:24:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	what soundcard do you have?
2008-02-17T16:26:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	maybe via 'alsamixer'
2008-02-17T16:27:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	i don't know if it's even possible via alsaconfig...just guessed it :D
2008-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	are you able to read german?
2008-02-17T16:28:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/152110/?highlight=surround
2008-02-17T16:31:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	wow, this translation is nearly readable :D
2008-02-17T16:31:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	did'nt know German->English works so fine
2008-02-17T16:35:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	everything in 'alsaconfig' at 100% ?
2008-02-17T16:37:00.000Z	MC_Lightning	Mike1	yes..that's everything at 100%
2008-02-17T16:39:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	i guess in your home directory
2008-02-17T16:40:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	no
2008-02-17T16:41:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	name should be ".asoundrc"
2008-02-17T16:42:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	wiki says: "The .asoundrc file (in your home directory) and /etc/asound.conf (for system-wide settings) are the configuration files for ALSA drivers."
2008-02-17T16:44:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	 a "." makes a file invisible
2008-02-17T16:44:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php/Playing_stereo_on_surround_sound_setup_%28Howto%29
2008-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	Mike1	MC_Lightning	maybe you should try this or search other articels in that wiki :)
