2012-01-18T17:31:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	Well i was thinking more of copying them if they were missing
2012-01-18T17:23:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	type "sudo modprobe <driver name>"
2012-01-18T17:23:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	in the terminal, of course
2012-01-18T17:24:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	I was going to try that but wasn't sure what the module was
2012-01-18T17:25:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	I use the wl broadcom driver, so sudo modprobe wl usually does it for me... you can "locate bcm | grep /lib/modules" to see what other bcm drivers there are :/
2012-01-18T17:26:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	I wonder why the system claims to be 'downloading' it when it handles prop drivers?
2012-01-18T17:27:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	(As if it really did, locate would fail)
2012-01-18T17:27:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	hm... It must be trying all over then. BTW, make sure your Wifi's switch is on.
2012-01-18T17:28:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	how come?
2012-01-18T17:28:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	Because the locate database wouldn't have been updated since the 'download'
2012-01-18T17:29:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	"sudo updatedb" then ;)
2012-01-18T17:29:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	I wonder how it downloads without a network connection though ? ;)
2012-01-18T17:30:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	I wonder how you want them to work without having them installed. Or am I missing something?
2012-01-18T17:31:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	Usually you plug in a wired LAN, let it take care of that, and then see if the drivers work
2012-01-18T17:31:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	that *can* work, but it may take you a while to get all of the dependencies right.
2012-01-18T17:34:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	Yes. It would just be a way around no network problem. I'm guessing that the 'downloading' thing is false and that they're really in the ramdisk. If so, i'll try modprobing it, though i'm surprised about the 'system requires restart' business. But of course there could be firmware issues too...
2012-01-18T17:35:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	"system requires restart" is an easy way of telling someone to modprobe :)
2012-01-18T17:35:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	the kernel loads modules upon modprobe or restart.
2012-01-18T17:37:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	>>is an easy way of telling someone to modprobe Yes - slightly too dumbed down perhaps? ;)
2012-01-18T17:38:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	no not really. From a design point of view, it's the best thing ever. Telling your normal office worker to open a terminal and write "sudo modprobe" is too difficult. Making a script that does that is too risky.
2012-01-18T17:40:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	Maybe, yes.
2012-01-18T17:41:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	get a connection because you cannot download drivers without any internet
2012-01-18T17:42:00.000Z	g00se	noordung	But this is where we came in ;) They must be already there as the system 'downloaded' them with no net connection - or did it?
2012-01-18T17:43:00.000Z	noordung	g00se	texas ^^
