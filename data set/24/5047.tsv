2007-08-14T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Have you tried bcm43xx-fwcutter ?
2007-08-14T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Can you pastebin the output of "lspci | grep Broadcom" ?
2007-08-14T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	I think that with a 4401 you need to use NDISwrapper :(
2007-08-14T11:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	It isn't supported with native Linux drivers but you may be able to use the windows drivers with a tool called NDISwrapper
2007-08-14T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Wait, I might be an idiot...
2007-08-14T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Be sure to do the "cd Desktop" part
2007-08-22T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	You may not need NDISwrapper
2007-08-22T05:37:00.000Z	travis	Jordan_U	really
2007-08-22T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	What is the exact chipset ( ie bcm43what )
2007-08-22T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Great, then just install the package bcm43xx-fwcutter
2007-08-22T05:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	Yes
2007-08-22T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	np
2007-08-22T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	travis	I have no idea, "Ubuntu Ultimate edition" is NOT official and is actually pretty hacked together, he is also in violation of the Ubuntu trademark by calling it an "edition" when it is just his own project
