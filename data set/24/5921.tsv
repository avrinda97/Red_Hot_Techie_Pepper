2006-03-26T09:57:00.000Z	yamathan		Hmm ...
2006-03-26T09:58:00.000Z	yamathan		I have Universe enabled in synaptic and/or apt-get, so why can't it find any of these packages?
2006-03-26T09:58:00.000Z	yamathan		The packages for GATOS, I mean.
2006-03-26T10:00:00.000Z	yamathan		Hey, why can't synaptic find any of these Universe packages?
2006-03-26T10:00:00.000Z	yamathan		Apt-get spits back that it can't find any of them, but they're officially supported unver miscellaneous.
2006-03-26T10:00:00.000Z	yamathan		*under miscellaneous
2006-03-26T10:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	You added the universe repo and did a "sudo apt-get update"?
2006-03-26T10:02:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 For some reason said programs aren't to be found by synaptic although they're in packages.ubuntulinux's list.
2006-03-26T10:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	Do you have universe and multiverse enabled
2006-03-26T10:03:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 Yes.  I don't know what's wrong here.
2006-03-26T10:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	What is KPackage?
2006-03-26T10:16:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 From what I get out of it it's a KDE frontend for apt-get/synaptic.
2006-03-26T10:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	What do you mean?
2006-03-26T10:24:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 For the past three times, apt-get has claimed there's nothing to update/upgrade.  At all.
2006-03-26T10:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	And?
2006-03-26T10:24:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 It's been like this for over a week.
2006-03-26T10:24:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 Considering that I have a LOT of packages, how can there be NONE to update right now?
2006-03-26T10:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	There probably isn't anything to update. If a package is stable and no security holes are found, it won't be updated. Its called a feature freeze.
2006-03-26T10:25:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 Ooooh.
2006-03-26T10:25:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 That's USEFUL.
2006-03-26T10:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	If you want some cutting edge packages then check out backports
2006-03-26T10:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	It is. It means peoples systems don't break just because they update.
2006-03-26T10:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	yamathan	its one of the reasons ubuntu is the top desktop linux
2006-03-26T10:27:00.000Z	yamathan	Stormx2	 I can see why.
