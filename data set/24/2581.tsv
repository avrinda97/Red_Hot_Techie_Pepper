2012-01-16T12:16:00.000Z	vegas		in your case you may have a kernel with name linux-image-2.6.35-2.6.35 - correct?
2012-01-16T12:17:00.000Z	vegas		or uname -r
2012-01-16T12:19:00.000Z	vegas		which is linux-image-2.6.35.13-2.6.35
2012-01-16T12:19:00.000Z	geri	vegas	can i rename the new kernel?:D
2012-01-16T12:06:00.000Z	vegas	geri	usually the kernel images are located in /boot - and they are not deleted - just because a new kernel is installed
2012-01-16T12:06:00.000Z	vegas	geri	One has to manually remove / delete them and update grub
2012-01-16T12:07:00.000Z	vegas	geri	u planning to build a kernel?
2012-01-16T12:11:00.000Z	geri	vegas	i finished: fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-some-string-here kernel-image kernel-headers
2012-01-16T12:14:00.000Z	vegas	geri	did you type anything for "some-string-here" ???
2012-01-16T12:14:00.000Z	geri	vegas	yes i wrote: --append-to-version=2.6.35
2012-01-16T12:15:00.000Z	vegas	geri	here's the deal ---append-to-version is used to put custom name e.g. "my-custom-kernel"
2012-01-16T12:16:00.000Z	geri	vegas	what should i do now?
2012-01-16T12:16:00.000Z	vegas	geri	so when you compile your kernel - the kernel name will be linux-image-2.6.35-my-custom-kernel
2012-01-16T12:17:00.000Z	geri	vegas	yes: linux-headers-2.6.35.132.6.35 ;(
2012-01-16T12:17:00.000Z	vegas	geri	what is the output of      uname -a
2012-01-16T12:18:00.000Z	geri	vegas	2.6.35-27-generic
2012-01-16T12:19:00.000Z	vegas	geri	- you are good to go - here is why ---- your current kernal is linux-image-2.6.35-27-generic - which is different from the kernel you just compiled
2012-01-16T12:20:00.000Z	vegas	geri	yes - before installing you can ----- after installing - you need to update grub (bootloader) to have the right name of the kernel file and location
2012-01-16T12:20:00.000Z	geri	vegas	can u help me?:D
2012-01-16T12:21:00.000Z	vegas	geri	go to the directory where you have the kernel
2012-01-16T12:24:00.000Z	geri	vegas	and how to install it now?
2012-01-16T12:44:00.000Z	geri	vegas	how long does it take to install the kernel approx?
2012-01-16T12:45:00.000Z	vegas	geri	depends on your system - 1 min - 5 min
2012-01-16T12:47:00.000Z	vegas	geri	/usr/share/doc --- is  your documentation folder
