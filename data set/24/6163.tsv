2006-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	byteshack		is it possible to install zope < 3 in dapper?
2006-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	dapper has zope2.7 and zope2.8 packages
2006-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	yes, it does
2006-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	but the bug tracking system says that they are not istallable.  Missing required dependency
2006-05-06T08:56:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	ah, kk, i hadn't tried installing them (yet)
2006-05-06T09:01:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	looks like the issue is with python2.3-xml.  You could try installing python2.3, then getting breezy's python2.3-xml via http://packages.ubuntu.com, then installing zope2.x
2006-05-06T09:02:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	I'm not a ubuntu jedi-master quite yet, and I'm not sure what else I would break in the process
2006-05-06T09:02:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	I'll give it a shot though, I'd really like to try that stuff out
2006-05-06T09:02:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	yes a certain amount of 'force' is required :P
2006-05-06T09:09:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	yes they will
2006-05-06T09:10:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	i've had a look at that bug - my kludgy workaround would only be good for 'having a look'.  Certainly not for any sort of production system (i'm sure this is obvious to you anyway but still) :)
2006-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	sounding like a medical profesional :) I wont take you to court, I promise :)
2006-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	lol!
2006-05-06T09:14:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	I'm downloading breezy's python2.3-xml... hope it works
2006-05-06T09:19:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	click on "i386" (or whatever) in the Download section of http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/python/python2.3-xml
2006-05-06T09:19:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	yes, they're in dapper
2006-05-06T09:21:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	yes agreed, those links are a bit obscure on the page
2006-05-06T09:21:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	thanks
2006-11-16T09:10:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	sudo apt-get remove --purge <package>
2006-11-16T09:11:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	thanks, so: dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | xargs apt-get remove --purge   should work?
2006-11-16T09:12:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	thanks, so: dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs apt-get remove --purge   should work?
2006-11-16T09:13:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	ha, i was just typing an explanation as to why the first one wouldn't work.  That might work.  Add a -s (meaning simulate) to the apt-get to test it
2006-11-16T09:15:00.000Z	byteshack	bimberi	thanks
2006-11-16T09:16:00.000Z	bimberi	byteshack	yw :)
