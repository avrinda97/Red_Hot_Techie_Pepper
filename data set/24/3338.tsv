2008-02-29T00:45:00.000Z	reikalusikka		I try to mount my external HD but I get this error message hal-storage-removable-mount-all-options refused uid 1000, It works fine in gnome
2008-02-29T00:45:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	That seems to be a bug in kde/kubuntu. The work arond is just to mount it from the command line
2008-02-29T00:46:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	how should I mount it and send it to automount? I'm a novice in these things :D
2008-02-29T00:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	You can't automount. You will have to manually mount. Is that ok?
2008-02-29T00:47:00.000Z	reikalusikka		well I think I'll manage
2008-02-29T00:47:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	byw how?
2008-02-29T00:47:00.000Z	reikalusikka		but*
2008-02-29T00:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	ok. do: "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt" ...
2008-02-29T00:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	Where sdb1 is your device and /mnt is the mount point.
2008-02-29T00:48:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	ok, thanks
2008-02-29T00:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	It is NTFS, right?
2008-02-29T00:48:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	yes
2008-02-29T00:49:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	so should I type media/myHD
2008-02-29T00:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	does /media/myHD exist?
2008-02-29T00:49:00.000Z	reikalusikka		it's the place where my hd is
2008-02-29T00:49:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	it's the place where my hd is
2008-02-29T00:50:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	I mean I don't need to type that dev1?
2008-02-29T00:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	The mount point must exist before you can mount anything there. e.g. "sudo mkdir /media/myHD"
2008-02-29T00:51:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-02-29T00:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	Yes. you need to tell what device you want to mount and where you want to mount it.
2008-02-29T00:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	To un-mount do "umount /mnt" or if you mounted to /media/myHD do "umount /media/myHD"
2008-02-29T00:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale		* sudo
2008-02-29T00:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	reikalusikka	Sorry "sudo umount /media/myHD"
2008-02-29T00:54:00.000Z	reikalusikka	Odd-rationale	I get "mount: special device media/elements does not exist"
