2006-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	Vyoming		 looking for help with SisM650 video driver - I could not get any hardware acceleration with the driver provided at http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsispart4.shtml#download
2006-07-09T14:29:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	i flew over that site, sure there is hardware acceleration in the free version ? or do you have the premium version ?
2006-07-09T14:30:00.000Z	Vyoming	oskude	- I downloaded the free version but it is not giving any improvement over the default FB driver that Ubuntu used
2006-07-09T14:31:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	well, you better ask the makers...
2006-07-09T14:33:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	and did you read this "Once again: There is no DRI/OpenGL/3D support for the SiS 6326, 5597/5598, 530/620, 315, 550, 650, 651, 740, 330, 661, 741, 760, 761 including all model variations with letters in the model number."
2006-07-09T14:37:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	"Additionally, a Linux kernel framebuffer driver for some SiS and XGI graphics cards is available here as well. This driver is meant for more advanced users as its installation requires some knowledge about kernel configuration and compilation." ;)
2006-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	this could be interesting: "Sidenote: Since this seems to be a commonly made mistake: sisfb and the kernel's VESA framebuffer driver cannot be active at the same time!"
2006-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	do you really need a bigger text console as the standard ?
2006-07-09T14:41:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	then you dont need that sisfb (frame buffer)
2006-07-09T14:42:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	thats another issue...
2006-07-09T14:43:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	dunno if flash uses XV
2006-07-09T14:43:00.000Z	Vyoming	oskude	I don't think it uses XV
2006-07-09T14:44:00.000Z	Vyoming	oskude	becuase realplayer is playing the videos fine
2006-07-09T14:44:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	how fast is your cpu ? (flash just sucks)
2006-07-09T14:44:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	oh, well, that should be enough...
2006-07-09T14:45:00.000Z	Vyoming	oskude	one more thing if you donot mind
2006-07-09T14:46:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	i dont use flash, so dunno...
2006-07-09T14:46:00.000Z	Vyoming	oskude	realplayer is playing video but audio is not coming
2006-07-09T14:46:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	do other audios work ?
2006-07-09T14:47:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	could be that you just have to select the right audio device (/dev/dsp)
2006-07-09T14:47:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	and sure realplayer uses ALSA (as i dont use realplayer neither...)
2006-07-09T14:49:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	and is there another programm using audio device ?
2006-07-09T14:51:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	then start realplayer new
2006-07-09T14:51:00.000Z	oskude	Vyoming	realplayers manual should say that. but i think its allso an option in realplayers preferences...
