2007-03-05T12:03:00.000Z	Pollywog		what is the best way to install Gnome on a kubuntu Edgy system?
2007-03-05T12:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	apt-get install gnome
2007-03-14T13:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	thats a potential branch of the libata kernel, that ubuntu has chosen to bring to production status
2007-03-14T13:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	what ?
2007-03-14T13:28:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	with this UUID situation
2007-03-14T13:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	how is that putting the cart before the horse
2007-03-14T13:30:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	if you go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks it seems as though we are testing this thing before it is ready
2007-03-14T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	well it is in the libata branch and it may change - but thats ubuntu's choice to make it stable - not the linux kernel team
2007-03-14T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	whats the difference in fesity or edgy - both are not LTS and even when fesity is released that libata branch still won't be main stream so why not in edgy
2007-03-14T13:33:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	in other words I should have stuck with Dapper for now?
2007-03-14T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	if you don't believe in the block id method - yes
2007-03-14T13:34:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	it's not that I don't believe in it as much as I think it is not ready since it would not work correctly for me in one case
2007-03-14T13:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	its not in the kernel mainstream yet - so log a bug / request for ubuntu - in say 7 months time the blkid method may not even exist
2007-03-14T13:52:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	yes if you were replying to me, it is too general for a bug report
2007-03-14T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	not sorry - not you
2007-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	ty I thought maybe there was another option
2007-03-25T07:18:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	how about rms?
2007-11-30T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	certainly
2007-11-30T02:43:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	did you see my pastebin?
2007-11-30T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	no
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Pollywog	that doesn't look right
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	what is wrong with it?
2007-11-30T02:46:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	I will Google on it some more, thanks
2007-11-30T03:02:00.000Z	Pollywog	ikonia	I found the problem with my sudo line, I just had to move it up in the file above the line that gives access to admin group
