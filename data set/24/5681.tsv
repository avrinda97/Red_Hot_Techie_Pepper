2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		who else would i be speaking for?
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	SonicChao	ZeZu	No one else in the open source world, promoting commercial products, but no matter.
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		doesn't handle all images and imbedded crap and it doesn't even bother to anti-alias
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		acroreader isn't a commercial product, its freeware, and you are using a "commercial" format
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		so yea
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	SonicChao		!anyone > Bahamanen
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		if acrobat is commercial, thats another story
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	SonicChao	ZeZu	let me see the code of it then...if there is no source, it's commercial. And plus there is a pay version.
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	ZeZu		actually, you obv dont seem to have a clue
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	ZeZu		not OSS doesn't mean its commercial
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu		i release my own softare, its not open source, but its definitely not commercial

2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu		freeware is freeware is freeware, whether or not they make a commercial editing software means nothing
