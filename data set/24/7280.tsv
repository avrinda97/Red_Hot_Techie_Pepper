2006-03-02T13:06:00.000Z	bubba		so, im setting up a amd turion 64 based laptop, which version of ubuntu is the best for my situation?
2006-03-02T13:07:00.000Z	cam	bubba	probably breezy amd64
2006-03-02T13:08:00.000Z	bubba	cam	thats what i was thinking of trying... i tried dapper 64, but had issues with not being  to get apps i wanted...
2006-03-02T13:11:00.000Z	cam	bubba	isn't dapper beta of breezy? they must have been fixed with breezy maybe
2006-03-02T13:11:00.000Z	bubba	cam	yeah... dapper is dev, breezy is stable
2006-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	cam	bubba	so you better try to use breezy and see if problems are gone :)
2006-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	cam	bubba	you can try fedora as well, it's really fine in those issues
2006-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	cam	bubba	though downloading 3 gb might make you regret :P
2006-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	bubba	cam	i dont like RH...
2006-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	cam	bubba	why? :)
2006-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	cam	bubba	fedora is different :P
2006-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	bubba	cam	I gave up around v7
2006-03-02T13:14:00.000Z	bubba	cam	sort of, but its the same idiots, and now theyve changed their business model in the crappiest way.
2006-03-02T13:15:00.000Z	cam	bubba	don't forget those idiots are employing lots of hackers which has invaluable effort in the OS you will install
2006-03-02T13:16:00.000Z	bubba	cam	well... i guess... just before fedora cam out i talked to thier cfo about it, and it was pretty clear that they like users to develop thier product, but dont want to waste any money helping users... just the big corps that buy thier systems...
2006-03-02T13:18:00.000Z	cam	bubba	well indeed they really can't support users without getting money. In past it was really doable beacuse rh users was really managable, but now it's unmanagable I think
2006-03-02T13:19:00.000Z	cam	bubba	besides RH had never evil bussiness model that anyone would disagree I think, if you got I really wonder reasons to get some idea
2006-03-02T13:20:00.000Z	bubba	cam	RH figures they can profit better from thier current model. its not too complicated.
2006-03-02T13:20:00.000Z	cam	bubba	what's wrong about profit?
2006-03-02T13:21:00.000Z	bubba	cam	nothing, profit is good, but not at the expense of users...
2006-03-02T13:21:00.000Z	cam	bubba	they didn't expense users, they are still supporting fedora, for desktop users
2006-03-02T13:21:00.000Z	cam	bubba	I for one, find fedora best desktop distro ever
2006-03-02T13:22:00.000Z	cam	bubba	using old software?
2006-03-02T13:22:00.000Z	bubba	cam	groovy... lots of people like it, but then lots of people like windows too...
