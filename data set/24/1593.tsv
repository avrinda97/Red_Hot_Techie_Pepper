2010-05-29T13:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	yeah, I guess rescue, and reinstall grub will have to be it.
2010-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	nice :)
2010-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	wildbat	greezmunkey	hmm @@?
2010-05-31T09:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	so hold the space bar from power up, is that supposed to get you into the grub menu?
2010-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	wildbat	greezmunkey	i think is shift never tried spacebar thou
2010-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	reason I ask is because I tried (both shift, and space actually) on a machine Fraiday and got nothing - but there may be deeper issues with it. Thanks, I'll leave you be.
2010-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	wildbat	greezmunkey	you have a solution yet? yo_  seem to be the case now
2010-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	well, that's a machine I installed server on last Friday. It wouldn't boot without the install cd, so I think the grub install failed. I didn't have time to mess with it, and will get inot it on Tuesday.
2010-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	wildbat	greezmunkey	oh ~ yo_'s one do boot but won't have a menu show for him to boot to win7
2010-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	wildbat	greezmunkey	you can reinstall grub then in that case
2010-05-31T09:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	yeah, I plan to...thanks :)
2010-05-31T09:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	wildbat	perhaps a console graphics issue from grub? I remember someone here posting a fix where you passed an arguement that killed graphics or something...
