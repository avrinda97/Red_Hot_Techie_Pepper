2007-01-04T09:59:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	got my PB mobo replaced 11months into owning it. Whenever there was HDD activity, it would make this god aweful squealing noise
2007-01-04T10:00:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	oh yeah, got Apple to replace my defective (also NOT in recall) battery after 11months also... :D
2007-01-04T10:00:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	didn't even have to pay shipping
2007-01-04T10:01:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	is your battery in the Sony recall?
2007-01-04T10:02:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	yeah, well I still think you'd better drop it while running, just to make sure
2007-01-04T10:02:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	that's how a lot of the battery accidents happen
2007-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	lithium in the batteries reacts violently to air
2007-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	if the cell is broken, it will "explode" which basically means 'will vent very very hot gases and other material until the catalyist is used up'
2007-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	some company a couple years back was boasting that you could drive over their cells and they wouldn't blow up...
2007-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	they even had some lab video of a hammer smashing the competition (it blew up) and smashing their battery (it just shorted out)
2007-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	how much are new Sony batteries?
2007-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	does your laptop use DDR, or DDR2?
2007-01-04T10:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	yeah, DDR SODIMMS have gone through the roof in prive
2007-01-04T10:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	even regular desktop DDR is going through the roof
2007-01-04T10:07:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Beckeh	6 months ago, the 2GB dual channel kit I bought was $220 from Newegg with shipping to Hawaii. Now it's $285 before taxes and shipping.
