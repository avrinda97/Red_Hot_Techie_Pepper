2006-09-02T06:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	(i.e., nonfree)
2006-09-02T06:48:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	no, not even those parts... automatix itself
2006-09-02T06:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	aha. check
2006-09-02T06:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	i was misinformed then :-)
2006-09-20T07:25:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	the latter you mean?
2006-09-25T15:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	it no longer supports AIM, unless there's a new version.
2006-09-25T15:41:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	er, I'm on AIM right now
2006-09-25T15:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	for serious? aim stopped working in my centericq back in december, and i've reinstalled it a few times (from scratch) and it still didn't work
2006-09-25T15:42:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	yeah, I've had no problems
2006-09-25T15:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	weird...i wonder why it suddenly stopped for me.
2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	what do you mean? gnome-desktop is a conglomeration of meta packages? what are you looking for?  gnome proper is in universe
2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	i'm trying to figure out what to tell daurn to dpkg-reconfigure
2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	ah, let me take a look
2006-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop will only reconfigure the meta-package and probably won't rewrite the .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions
2006-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	might try gnome-session
2006-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	thanks muchly
2006-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	or nautilus, if that doesnt
2006-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	thanks
2006-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	"add/remove" is the dumbed down interface in the menues
2006-10-02T14:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	oh, i see. but isn't synaptic well under the standard definition of ``user-friendly?''
2006-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	ladydoor	it is, but not if you only know you want "a web browser" or whatever, add remove has suggested apps etc
2006-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	oh, i see. check.
2006-10-02T14:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	Flannel	sounds complicated.
