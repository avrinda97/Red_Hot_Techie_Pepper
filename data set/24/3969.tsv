2010-03-28T01:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	olga_	? after you edit /etc/default/grub you have to run « sudo update-grub »
2010-03-28T01:51:00.000Z	olga_	erUSUL	i havent did that last time i changed settings can this be a reason it didnt worked?
2010-03-28T01:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	olga_	could be. you have to run this so a new /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated based on the /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/* contents
