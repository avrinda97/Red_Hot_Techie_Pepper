2007-03-30T10:05:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	Depends on your current situation. If you have 3D grpahics drivers then pretty much yes
2007-03-30T10:06:00.000Z	linuxnooblah	Warbo	yes i do :D
2007-03-30T10:07:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	I followed the guide on http://help.ubuntu.com/community and it worked out fine

2007-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	linuxnooblah	Warbo	from where ?
2007-03-30T10:19:00.000Z	linuxnooblah	Warbo	from where ?
2007-03-30T10:20:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	If you have installed Beryl then to run it you should run the command (Alt-F2) "beryl-manager"
2007-03-30T10:23:00.000Z	linuxnooblah	Warbo	couldnt find the file :X
2007-03-30T10:24:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	Oh. Hmm. Maybe things have changed or you followed a different guide
2007-03-30T10:25:00.000Z	linuxnooblah	Warbo	i used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy, yes i think this is old :X
2007-03-30T10:32:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	I followed this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Beryl?highlight=%28beryl%29
2007-03-30T10:47:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	Do you have an ATI card?
2007-03-30T10:47:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	Then I'd go with AiGLX not XGL
2007-03-30T10:47:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	(that link is for XGL)
2007-03-30T10:50:00.000Z	Warbo	linuxnooblah	Nvidia don't tell people how their cards work, and they don't make a free (as in open source) driver. Therefore by default a free driver needs to be used by Ubuntu, and that is called nv, but if you want 3D then you need to use nvidia's non-open source (but no cst) driver "nvidia". The noveau project is trying to reverse engineer a free 3D driver but it isn't usable yet
