2009-07-19T07:38:00.000Z	Shawnc		hi can someone help me please?
2009-07-19T07:38:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	when did this occur ?
2009-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	around 2 seconds before I posted it
2009-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	heh, did you try an install, or an update ?
2009-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	What were you saying?
2009-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	did you try an install, or an update ?
2009-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	in asking when that occurred , did you put any third party soft on ore is an update failed ?
2009-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	jaunty ?
2009-07-19T07:46:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	jaunty so, what happens at: sudo apt-get update ?
2009-07-19T07:48:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	easy item, your apt ?
2009-07-19T07:50:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	 what happens at: sudo apt-get update ?
2009-07-19T07:52:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	When ever I try a command it won't work it just does "E: Internal Error, Could not perform immediate configuration (1) on findutils"
2009-07-19T07:53:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	have you tried to to fix the findutils package ?
2009-07-19T07:54:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	findutils is already the newest version.
2009-07-19T07:56:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	how do I fixthat error?
2009-07-19T08:14:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	my first thought won't work so easy, findutils is an essential part of apt , as it seems; can't you give more information about the circumstances ?
2009-07-19T08:14:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	?
2009-07-19T08:16:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	I tried to re-install findutils on a vm here, and it wants to take down two gigs of data, can't be the solution
2009-07-19T08:17:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	I don't know how you can help me :P because this is getting really annoying.
2009-07-19T08:18:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	I also have no straight advice, your apt is broken somehow, and you can't remember what caused this ?
2009-07-19T08:19:00.000Z	Shawnc	DasEi	nothing caused it d:
2009-07-19T08:19:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	what does a : sudo dpkg --configure -a       ?
2009-07-19T08:20:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	what does a : sudo dpkg --configure -a       ?
2009-07-19T08:22:00.000Z	DasEi	Shawnc	so you got to ask for someone with a deeper look in apt, I give up here, sorry
