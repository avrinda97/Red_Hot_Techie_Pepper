2011-07-01T23:19:00.000Z	rajat123		hm....i hv ubuntu installd alongside windows 7....bt i hd some prb so i hd 2 uninstall ubuntu. now i hv a 10.04 version iso file. how cn i use wubi 2 install using dis iso file??
2011-07-01T23:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 put the file in the same place as the wubi.exe I think and it will see it..  or have wubi download the iso. and stop the download. then copy the full iso over the partial.. personally I suggest NOT using wubi at all.
2011-07-01T23:20:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	: den wt shuld i use in place f wubi?
2011-07-01T23:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 i suggest doing a normal install. or using ubuntu in virtualbox.. ive just seen SO many people in here with wubi disasters.
2011-07-01T23:22:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	dt means i wil have to remove windows rite?
2011-07-01T23:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 not at all.. You can repartition and have linux alongside windows.. thats how most people do it.
2011-07-01T23:24:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	cn i partition using the live cd? actualy wen i run wubi....it strts downloadng some 'lucid' version.

2011-07-01T23:27:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	i cnt partition. cn u hlp me with wubi?
2011-07-01T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 You have the lucid wubi installer then.. go get  a newer wuibi installer.. or do a normal install.. whatever you perfer to do.
2011-07-01T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 i dont use wubi.. and you DONT need to partuiton when you use wubi
2011-07-01T23:30:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	is it nyhow possible dat the newer version of wubi wil install using my 10.04 iso image wich i already have?
2011-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 newer  version of wubi.. will want the newer ISO files....
2011-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 I dont use wubi.. so it may be possible to force it.. the iso SHOULD have a wubi.exe on it..
2011-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	rajat123	 burn the iso or open it somehow. and use that wubi if you really want to.
2011-07-01T23:32:00.000Z	rajat123	dr_willis	oh yeah! got it. thanks a lot dr_willis! really appreciated your help!
