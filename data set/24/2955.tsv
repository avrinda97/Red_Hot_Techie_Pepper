2008-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	laughtear		i've been for years on this channel, and i even tried to give some help about improving ubuntu better.
2008-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	laughtear		there ain't no response
2008-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	laughtear		i believe in free softwares
2008-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	laughtear		but i see some "people" offering me about buying an operating system
2008-10-29T00:11:00.000Z	laughtear		that's a shame
2008-10-29T00:12:00.000Z	laughtear		the question were so simple: there were a choice in hardy heron when you right click to a folder.. it was file sharing options
2008-10-29T00:12:00.000Z	laughtear		here we are in ibex, i can't see that
2008-10-29T00:13:00.000Z	laughtear		maybe i have done somn' wrong
2008-10-29T00:13:00.000Z	laughtear		and my files stuck in my old pc which i have to deliver to someone tomorrow
2008-10-29T00:14:00.000Z	laughtear		so, probably i go and buy a windows tonite, and say farewell both my files and to you all, is that the thing you work on it for hours, maybe years.
2008-10-29T00:14:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	what was your question again?
2008-10-29T00:16:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	musictoto: ok. so what's wrong with NFS?
2008-10-29T00:17:00.000Z	laughtear	LjL	there is no Nautilus File Share (or whtvr), that's the situation on my pc
2008-10-29T00:17:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	Nautilus has nothing to do with it. well, i thought NFS support was installed by default, but it should be easy to get installed. do you know how to install software?
2008-10-29T00:20:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	but ubuntu doesn't come with a *default* sharing system
2008-10-29T00:21:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	Samba is made to communicate with Windows networks. of course, you can also use it between Ubuntu machines if desired.
2008-10-29T00:29:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	if you're running 8.04, you really should have a sharing option in the proprieties when you right click a file. are you running a previous version?
2008-10-29T00:30:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	if you're on 8.10, which is currently unreleased and unsupported, you should ask in #ubuntu+1
2008-10-29T00:30:00.000Z	laughtear	LjL	this is intrepid ibex, the other pc in the house is hardy heron buddy. again: i have to pc's both using ubuntu (one of them is intrepid other one is hardy). and i can't make this computers see each other in network
2008-10-29T00:31:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	ok, on the *Hardy* computer, do you see no sharing options in a folder's proprieties?
2008-10-29T00:32:00.000Z	laughtear	LjL	i see it there, but i can't see the intrepid pc
2008-10-29T00:32:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	well, but surely neither PC will see the other until you start actually sharing a folder on one?
2008-10-29T00:33:00.000Z	laughtear	LjL	there are shared files in hardy pc, but there can't be any in this intrepid
2008-10-29T00:33:00.000Z	LjL	laughtear	that might be a bug with Intrepid, we don't deal with Intrepid here. see if you can share a folder in the *Hardy* PC, using right-click etc, and view it from the *Intrepid* one
