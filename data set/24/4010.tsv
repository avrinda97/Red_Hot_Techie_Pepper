2009-02-19T02:17:00.000Z	The_Joe_		I had to forcefully stop an apt - how can I free the administration directory?
2009-02-19T02:18:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	usually this command does that: sudo apt-get update
2009-02-19T02:18:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	k - trying
2009-02-19T02:19:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	Ok my connection dropped out and I had to forcefully stop that too >.<
2009-02-19T02:19:00.000Z	The_Joe_		Now I'm screwed
2009-02-19T02:19:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	hm? I didn't understand, can you do once more: sudo apt-get update
2009-02-19T02:20:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	does it show any errors?
2009-02-19T02:20:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	Yes " cannot lock administration directory..."
2009-02-19T02:20:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	I know what causes it and there was a command to unlock the directory
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	The_Joe_		But I forgot what it is
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	"Could not open lock file
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	"Could not open lock file" ?
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	Yes
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	Ah got it
2009-02-19T02:21:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
2009-02-19T02:22:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	then: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-02-19T02:22:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	sudo apt-get update finishes but then gives me the same error "/
2009-02-19T02:23:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	what's the output of: cat /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
2009-02-19T02:23:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	Doesn't exist
2009-02-19T02:24:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	how about this: ps aux | grep -i apt
2009-02-19T02:24:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	send the output at www.pastebin.com
2009-02-19T02:24:00.000Z	The_Joe_	savvas	ubottu seems to have given me something - I'll try that
2009-02-19T02:25:00.000Z	The_Joe_		k that works
2009-02-19T02:25:00.000Z	savvas	The_Joe_	suit yourself
