2008-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	isabel__		how can i edit the bios options from ubuntu so it chooses to boot directly from hard drive everytime when i press f12 it asks from which device i want to boot from but what i want is to jump to grub right from start off
2008-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	isabel__		i installed an stripped down version of ubuntu, right now i'm installing kubuntu
2008-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	isabel__		i can't do a clean install
2008-09-20T09:01:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	no, you have to do that during start-up before the BIOS initialises the system. Usually you press F2 or Del to get to the menu, where you can find boot device options
2008-09-20T09:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	it sounds as if you need to press some other key (try F2 or Del) immediately the PC starts before you see the F12 prompt. If someone has a Toshiba maybe they can be more help.
2008-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	if that works, find the boot device options, change the boot order so it is CD then hard-disk, then find the 'save and exit' option and save
2008-09-20T09:04:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	i think it's already set to cd, i want to do set it to hard disk first
2008-09-20T09:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	It is usual to allow CD first so if needed the system can boot from one if the hard disk won't boot for any reason. As long as no bootable CD is in the drive when the PC starts it will be ignored and the PC will boot from hard disk
2008-09-20T09:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	That error you mentioned sounds like Windows :)
2008-09-20T09:07:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	what does it look like it's set up to do then? it definetly isn't just moving on to hard drive but asks for a disk to be inserted and i did that for a moment to see if the livecd would work but even when i did that it still prompted me to insert disk and press any key
2008-09-20T09:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	Is Windows also installed on that PC?
2008-09-20T09:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	Does the PC boot Ubuntu if you do the F12 device selection manually?
2008-09-20T09:13:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	yes but i dont want to have to do that everytime
2008-09-20T09:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	ok, I was just making sure you have a working system of some kind!
2008-09-20T09:14:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	i don't want to have to press f12 everytime
2008-09-20T09:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	 I suspect you might need to use grub-install with suitable options - it sounds as if the BIOS isn't finding the master boot record boot signature. I could be wrong because your situation is vague, but it would explain why you get the BIOS device prompt each time.
2008-09-20T09:18:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	how do i do that?
2008-09-20T09:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	Before messing with GrUB I'd try what we suggested earlier. As the PC starts try pressing Del or F2 to get into the BIOS settings menu and set the boot order options
2008-09-20T09:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	The key has to be pressed very early - before the F12 prompt appears
2008-09-20T09:19:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	As I said before, CD then hard-disk. If the PC has a floppy fdisk you might make it floppy, CD, hard-disk
2008-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	floppy fdisk?
2008-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	yes, if the PC has one... the devices are ignored unless they have media in them when the PC starts
2008-09-20T09:21:00.000Z	isabel__	IntuitiveNipple	floppy =normal common floppy?
2008-09-20T09:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	isabel__	yes
