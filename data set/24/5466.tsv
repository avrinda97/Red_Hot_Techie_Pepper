2006-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	benville		hey guys still stuck on 800x600 any ideas
2006-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	benville		i want my 1280x768
2006-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	benville		xgl will look much better at that rez
2006-07-05T05:47:00.000Z	benville		nvidia gforce
2006-07-05T05:48:00.000Z	benville		think so installed nvidia driver
2006-07-05T05:49:00.000Z	benville		xgl/compiz is working
2006-07-05T05:49:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	look at your /etc/X11/xorg.conf near the bottom, you will see multiple lines that have a list of common resolution types, take out all of the ones higher than your preferred res on all lines to get GDM to use your preferred res (as well as your desktop which can be set in Preferences)
2006-07-05T05:50:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	and you can use automatix to install nvidia drivers easily
2006-07-05T05:51:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	this? http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-networking/13664-upload-speed-limiting-apache.html
2006-07-05T05:51:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	oops wrong link... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/  <-- that
2006-07-05T06:06:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	xgl and compiz will interfere with nvidia 3d glx
2006-07-05T06:07:00.000Z	benville	dgh1973	could you have a look 2
2006-07-05T06:08:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	this looks good for a 3d enabled nvidia setup
2006-07-05T06:09:00.000Z	benville	dgh1973	but need to work with 1280x768
2006-07-05T06:11:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	widescreen?  or did you mean 1280x1024?
2006-07-05T06:12:00.000Z	benville	dgh1973	 gnomefreak any more ideas
2006-07-05T06:12:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	widescreen?  or did you mean 1280x1024?
2006-07-05T06:13:00.000Z	benville	dgh1973	widescreen
2006-07-05T06:13:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	I sent a correction that will add that res, but if it doesnt't work then I would guess the monitor doesn't like the res
2006-07-05T06:14:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	of course make a backup first ;-)
2006-07-05T06:15:00.000Z	benville	dgh1973	the monitor is built in its a sony vgc-v2m
2006-07-05T06:15:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	if it will run at that res then the corrections should work (crosses fingers!)
2006-07-05T06:18:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	check that link in the pastebin again, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17201  - change is subtle, in the resolution listings
2006-07-05T06:23:00.000Z	dgh1973	benville	later man, let me know how it goes, good luck
