2008-10-04T19:51:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose		I don't believe I'm using either of them.  I'll check Synaptic.
2008-10-04T19:52:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	no if you didn't manualy configure, they're disabled by default

2008-10-04T19:53:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose		FFS...I have ufw installed
2008-10-04T19:53:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose		must have been something I put on a long time ago. I'll remove it now.

2008-10-04T19:54:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	ufw is installed but not enabled by default. don't touch it
2008-10-04T19:54:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose		oh
2008-10-04T19:54:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	have you done hamachi go-online <network name>?
2008-10-04T19:54:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose	hyperair	I'm using the gHamachi GUI. I logged in, and I see all the other computers, and the Windows computer in particular with a green dot that indicates it's online
2008-10-04T19:55:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	but you musth ave a green dot next to the network name, if i'm not mistaken
2008-10-04T19:56:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	right click on the network and click go online. just because *they* are online, it doesn't mean that *you* are online
2008-10-04T19:57:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose	hyperair	the network does indeed have a red dot. However, my Hamachi "power" icon is green, and if I press it, I go "Offline" (network and peers disappear). I click it again., it goes "Logging into Hamachi" and redisplays the network and peers.
2008-10-04T19:57:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	you don't understand what i mean. right click on the NETWORK NAME.
2008-10-04T19:57:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	and click go online
2008-10-04T19:57:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose	hyperair	oh I see...it works now.
2008-10-04T19:58:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose	hyperair	thank you for all your help. I don't recall having to do this in the Windows version...I figured if I can see the other users, it meant I'm logged in. I should've been using the console version to avoid this. Thanks for saving my lazy ass.
2008-10-04T20:00:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	ah hell. i don't know how to use ghamachi. in the command line, it's "hamachi go-online <network name>"
2008-10-04T20:00:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	on nevrmind, you got it working eh? good for you.
2008-10-04T20:01:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose	hyperair	it's my fault for using an unofficial GUI instead of the developer's instructions (CLI). Except for this thing, gHamachi is 100% identical to the Windows version, which is why I was fooled.
2008-10-04T20:01:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	no, it's not 100% identical. i use hamachi-gui instead.
2008-10-04T20:02:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	and hamachi's linux version works like that, it's not a question of GUI or CLI.
2008-10-04T20:02:00.000Z	hyperair	MachinTrucChose	blame hamachi for producing a program that's not standard on both linux and windows versions
