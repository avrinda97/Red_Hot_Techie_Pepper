2008-05-08T17:44:00.000Z	deserteagle		good morning all!
2008-05-08T17:44:00.000Z	deserteagle		:D
2008-05-08T17:45:00.000Z	deserteagle		would anyone happen to know how to set up a samba share across a virtual machine?
2008-05-08T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 that dident make a lot of sence.  if you mean like virtual box, or vmware, you set it up in the OS the machine is running. The VM and the real machine are networked on a virtual network normally
2008-05-08T17:46:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	i tried this and it didn't work: http://2tap.com/2007/04/22/sharing-files-between-a-windows-guest-and-ubuntu-host-using-vmware-and-samba/
2008-05-08T17:47:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	winXP fails to connect to the samba shared folder
2008-05-08T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 i dident have to mess with much of anything. i just configured windows  to  see my samba network the same as i did a normal machine.
2008-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 see if the windows machine can ping the linux box, see if it can ssh to the machine also. as a test I guess. May be a networking issue
2008-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	aaah.... see i don't quite know how to do that :P
2008-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 the samba-doc package has several books on using samba. :) worth reading
2008-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	it pings, yet it won't connect when i give it the username and password
2008-05-08T17:48:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	guess i'll check out the samba-doc
2008-05-08T17:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 you did give the linxu user a Samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME' ?  You did set up some Shares on the linux box? You did install samba on the linux box?
2008-05-08T17:49:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	no, yes and yes
2008-05-08T17:50:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	just typed it out and yes, i had given it a password. I just eliminated it though
2008-05-08T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 for simple file transfers from windows  to/from linux - i also often use ssh, and winscp on the windows box.
2008-05-08T17:53:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	would googling ssh and winscp help or do you know of any good tutorial on using them both?
2008-05-08T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 ssh is documented all over the place. :) in short.. install the ssh server. download/install winscp on the windows box. Run it.. enter ip/name/pass of the linux box.
2008-05-08T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 it will be a bit slower then samba. But i use it when i just want to do some one time file transfers
2008-05-08T17:55:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	thank you so much for the help. I wish my apps would work under wine but i guess i'll just have to transfer each windows file it needs over to the wine drive_c and hope it runs
2008-05-08T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 depends on the ap. for wine you may want to try the newer wine thats in the unofficial repos also.
2008-05-08T17:56:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	did that actually, and tried crossover office, crossover games, cedega, wine with mono... :( nothing
2008-05-08T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	deserteagle	 what are you trying to run?
2008-05-08T18:47:00.000Z	deserteagle	Dr_willis	thank you once again for the help and have a great day! :D
