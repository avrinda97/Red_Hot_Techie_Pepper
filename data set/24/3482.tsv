2009-01-16T14:33:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	REM cycle.
2009-01-16T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	you could sleep 8 hours but if you never hit deep sleep you wont be overly rested
2009-01-16T14:34:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	On behalf of comparisons. 8 hours of craptacular sleep > 2 hours of solid sleep
2009-01-16T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	id rather have a short but hugely dep sleep, makes me feel awesome
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	naps make me feel sick, so :p
2009-01-16T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	if im up half the night and have many catnaps I feel nasty
2010-09-11T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	boot to liveCD and reinstall grub2
2010-09-11T05:19:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	I just said I couldnt boot to liveCD :P or i would of done that
2010-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	then use a USB device
2010-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	Thats what I do, Its my video card, livecd does not like it.
2010-09-11T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	then use bootoptions to specify safe vga
2010-09-11T05:21:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	tried that.
2010-09-11T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	how did you install then?
2010-09-11T05:21:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	netinstall :)
2010-09-11T05:22:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	Is there no way within the grub rescue> shell to actually rescue grub?
2010-09-11T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	try a different livecd then, may have different options for your video chip, or you could blacklist the video chip driver to then use vesa
2010-09-11T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	you can type grub commands to get a boot
2010-09-11T05:25:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	I see what happened.... it installed grub on the USB i installed from. Jeeeez you think it would of detected the drive and done it there
2010-09-11T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	i'm not that conversant with grub to know the commands etc but I know you can type stuff to boot from that prompt
2010-09-11T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	linux is flexible, so you can do as you wish, glad you worked it out dude :)
2010-09-11T05:26:00.000Z	Delvien	ActionParsnip	Lol, i know, ive been using ubuntu for 6 years now, just the first time ive dealt with grub2 ( I dont like it!)
2010-09-11T05:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Delvien	i single boot so any bootloader is fine by me
