2007-04-02T11:09:00.000Z	thecort		how can I tell what version of the kernel I'm using?
2007-04-02T11:11:00.000Z	thecort		anyone know why I would get this error: FATAL: Could not open'/lib/modules/2.6.17-11-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko': No such file or directory
2007-04-02T11:11:00.000Z	thecort		 when I try to modprobe ndiswrapper
2007-04-02T11:11:00.000Z	thecort		I thought it may be that I'm using a different kernel, but that'sthe same
2007-04-02T11:11:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	uname -a
2007-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	Linux thecort-laptop 2.6.17-11-generic #2 SMP Thu Feb 1 19:52:28 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	theres your clue on which kernel version you use
2007-04-02T11:13:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	right, it matches the one in the wrror, I can't figure out why I'm getting that error
2007-04-02T11:13:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	i dont know what error you're getting i missed your pasting
2007-04-02T11:14:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-11-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko': No such file or directory
2007-04-02T11:15:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	did you look in that dir if that file really exist?
2007-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	there is nothing in the /lib/modules/2.6.17-11-generic/misc$
2007-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	but I don't know what to put in there
2007-04-02T11:17:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	thats why it complains it can not find it
2007-04-02T11:18:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	any idea what I should put in there to get this thing working?
2007-04-02T11:19:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	how did you get that SMP kernel installed? maybe it does not have ndiswrapper?
2007-04-02T11:20:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	I installed ndiswrapper. As far as the kernel, this is the standard edgy install
2007-04-02T11:20:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	your error says its looking for the Kernel version of ndiswrapper not a loadable module noh?
2007-04-02T11:22:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	it says no such file or directory
2007-04-02T11:22:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	yeah, do you know for sure that the SMP version of the  kernel have an ndiswrapper.ko module?
2007-04-02T11:23:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	no
2007-04-02T11:24:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	well go do a research on it
2007-04-02T11:25:00.000Z	thecort	bulmer	someone in a forum said they had the same problem and reinstalled the kernel source and it worked. I'm not sure if that says anything about the issue. If so, how would I go about doing that?
2007-04-02T11:26:00.000Z	bulmer	thecort	you have do download the SMP kernel and then compile it
