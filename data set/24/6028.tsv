2006-02-25T06:52:00.000Z	moonunit		how do i go about making a swap partition?
2006-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	moonunit		i want to do the swap on the neutral drive
2006-02-25T06:55:00.000Z	moonunit		i have all three mounted
2006-02-25T06:55:00.000Z	dyrne_	moonunit	maybe easiest to use cfdisk /dev/hd* to make partition
2006-02-25T06:56:00.000Z	moonunit		cfdisk?
2006-02-25T06:56:00.000Z	dyrne_	moonunit	sudo cfdisk /dev/whateverharddrive will open cfdisk displaying paritions and will let you add or del more
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	moonunit	dyrne	PM me if you can
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	dyrne_	moonunit	then follow previous instructions on making partitiion swap
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	moonunit	dyrne	i dont know the names of my drives
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	moonunit		nor do i know how to navigate to them from terminal, which would help alot
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	dyrne_	moonunit	sudo fdisk -l will list them
2006-02-25T06:58:00.000Z	dyrne_	moonunit	cfdisk /dev/hda or hdb etc.
