2008-10-02T03:43:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	if you scroll down, you will see where it instructs to scroll down and activate the stacks applet
2008-10-02T03:44:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	whenever your ready
2008-10-02T03:44:00.000Z	gamikage	tuxy	let me see something there
2008-10-02T03:44:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	ok
2008-10-02T03:48:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	i haven't told you what the problem is yet
2008-10-02T03:48:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	:)
2008-10-02T03:48:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	the database when you click on the applets tab says that you can activate the stacks applet, though it is not listed in the version that i have
2008-10-02T03:49:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	i got the version that was downloaded by the apt-get by the url that was given in the document i think
2008-10-02T03:51:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	i think that's pointless, but i'll give it a shot
2008-10-02T04:04:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	i got it
2008-10-02T04:04:00.000Z	gamikage	tuxy	you got what_
2008-10-02T04:04:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	the search utility did not work. I was to search for it myself
2008-10-02T04:05:00.000Z	tuxy	gamikage	the problem finding the stack applet
