2007-03-28T16:08:00.000Z	Tatster		Hi all.  I'm installing Ubuntu server on a new machine and have had a nightmate with LVM and partitions but installing is progressing - but it has go to LILO and it now says LILO install failed - what should I do ?
2007-03-28T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	it installs lilo by default? I thought Grub was the flavour of the month?
2007-03-28T16:09:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	that's what the install scripts are trying to install
2007-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	ah... so the Grub install fails? any error messages?
2007-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	oh.. and I don't know about the repos in feisty.. sorry
2007-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	This is edgy server
2007-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	but you can ask in #ubuntu+1 .That channel is dedicated to feisty suport
2007-03-28T16:12:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	sorry bout that.. so.. it is trying to install Lilo.. what is the error message? just "install failed"?
2007-03-28T16:13:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	hmm.. well.. try continuing.. perhaps you can redo this step later.. you're not using anything weird in the disk setup?
2007-03-28T16:14:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	as in????
2007-03-28T16:15:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	weird is for example.. using extremelt large or extremely small hard drives.. booting many operating systems from the same hard drive... using some ancient motherboard.... using a very very new motherboard
2007-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	that doesn't sound weird to me... I haven't used lvm myself though..
2007-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	in that case no, quite normal.  a Dell Optiplex gx280 with a single 250GB IDE disk at the moment
2007-03-28T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	but continue the install.. I think you can install LILO or Grub later on
2007-03-28T16:17:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	ok - here goes nothing!
2007-03-28T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	I don't remember any problems with LILO/grub when I installed edgy... but I might just have been lucky
2007-03-28T16:20:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	  It's looking good.  Rebooted at the end of the  install - and LILO ran, and now my shiny new server is coming alive!
2007-03-28T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	KurtKraut: apparently his install disc wants to install lilo.. I was asking myself the same question
2007-10-29T00:13:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	apt-get will upgrade for you I think.. all console
2007-10-29T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	why not run vlc or something else quick and dirty to set up?
2007-10-29T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	sorry.. vnc
2007-10-29T00:16:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	That's a good shout.  Up till now I've just had Webmin on there
2007-10-29T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	Tatster	I think there's a package that just shares your current desktop using vnc.. nothing to setup apart from perhaps a password.. xvncclient or something like that
2007-10-29T00:18:00.000Z	Tatster	Slart	cool
