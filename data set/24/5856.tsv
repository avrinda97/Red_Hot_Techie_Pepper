2007-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	jnc		i.e. some ridiculous number, and the command for down one character
2007-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	mine's better.  ;-)
2007-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	You win my hat.
2007-05-05T12:15:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	typo?
2007-05-05T12:19:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	 You're wrong, c++ is the most useful thing in the world.  :-p
2007-05-05T12:19:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	it's a joke set unto humanity by B.S.
2007-05-05T12:20:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	So are you a C guy or a Java guy, then?  ;-)
2007-05-05T12:22:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	Admittedly, c++ has some syntactic oddities, but it's quite nice that it compiles down to machine code and runs fast.
2007-05-05T12:23:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	hush
2007-05-05T12:24:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	I swear I'll shut up if someone can tell me a way to make gnome automatically suspend when battery is low.  :)
2007-05-05T12:25:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	the power preference app, I think
2007-05-05T12:25:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	well I had trouble with some permissions though
2007-05-05T12:25:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	Doesn't seem to mention a level at which to shutdown, or commands to run when low...
2007-05-05T12:25:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	it would signal the command, and the command would fail to run
2007-05-05T12:34:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	I'm quite used to linux/unix, but quite new to gnome/nautilus/metacity, usually preferring to immediately switch to using startx/fluxbox - so, on THAT note, if there were some kind of permission problems launching a suspend script for me, is there anywhere where error messages would be logged?
2007-05-05T12:34:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	no, that's the sad thing.
2007-05-05T12:35:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	the google trail goes like this, figure out what dbus / hal thing is used for suspend to ram, then read more about it and how to send that message by hand, do it and run the daemons in debug mode
2007-05-05T12:35:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	the end answer is you edit some kind of funky permissions file that describes which users are permitted to signal events that take down the box (i.e. suspend)
2007-05-05T12:35:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	I'm pretty set up for that - I can run the dbus command with dbus-send
2007-05-05T12:36:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	That makes me think that any IPC stuff going on behind the scenes should just be working
2007-05-05T12:36:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	Which makes me think that it is an acpi/acpid/HAL problem (one of those, ;))
2007-05-05T12:36:00.000Z	jnc	godlygeek	I'm not terribly motivated to revisit this particular issue, sorry mate
2007-05-05T12:37:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	thanks anyway, then.
2007-05-05T12:45:00.000Z	godlygeek	jnc	kids these days don't know what a modem is!
