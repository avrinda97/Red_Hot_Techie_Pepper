2006-01-14T14:07:00.000Z	zim		am in there now
2006-01-14T14:07:00.000Z	davey	zim	theres a couple of things you can do, the easiest is to edit ~/.vimrc and add: "color: murphy"
2006-01-14T14:07:00.000Z	davey	zim	replacing murphy with your preferred color scheme :)
2006-01-14T14:07:00.000Z	zim		ty
2006-01-14T14:08:00.000Z	zim		where do u add them
2006-01-14T14:08:00.000Z	davey	zim	just anywhere in that file is fine
2006-01-14T14:09:00.000Z	davey	zim	you may also want to add: :syn on, for syntax highlighting
2006-01-14T14:09:00.000Z	zim	davey	where do u add new themes
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	zim		ty
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	davey	zim	you want to add a new theme? somewhere in .vim :)
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	davey	zim	~/.vim - I think.
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	zim	davey	.vimrc not there should i just add it
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	davey		I personally find the defaults to be more than adequate (theres is a lot)
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	davey	zim	yes, just create it
2006-01-14T14:10:00.000Z	zim		ty
2006-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	davey	zim	in vim; if you type <esc> :color <tab>, pressing the <tab> key will go through them all :)
2006-01-14T14:11:00.000Z	davey	zim	and my config line was wrong, its ":color murphy"
