2010-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	what do you mean with "which is corrupt in the boot"?
2010-02-20T10:16:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	you ca reinstall grub from a live cd
2010-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	pepee	no i cant. i've tried everything, and it wont work. i've given up
2010-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	even "grub-install"?
2010-02-20T10:19:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	i think the best you can do is reinstall grub
2010-02-20T10:19:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	are you sure your linux partition is OK?
2010-02-20T10:20:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	just copy them from the cd...
2010-02-20T10:20:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	pepee	the cd has one file, for booting the cd
2010-02-20T10:21:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	yep, and after booting linux with that files, you can simply reinsxtall linu
2010-02-20T10:26:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	do you know what means "mount"?
2010-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	well, I'm not understanding what your problem is...
2010-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	pepee	let me make it clear.
2010-02-20T10:31:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	to reinstall ubunyu you can simply copy/paste the files...
2010-02-20T10:32:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	and where is it...?
2010-02-20T10:34:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	ok. I think you have to copy your config files by hand
2010-02-20T10:35:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	system config files? browser configs? ...?
2010-02-20T10:37:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	pepee	its not the configurations i need to keep. i can reset those in 10 minutes. the files, images from school, mp3s, movies, stuff like that

2010-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	maybe the mbr is corrupted
2010-02-20T10:41:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	you can run fsck too
2010-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	you have 2 disks, and you want to recover all of the data from one of them, and you can't run ubuntu from that disk. is that?
2010-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	pepee	CkhiKuzad	cfdisk
