2009-10-16T03:06:00.000Z	pacifica		G'day all - does anyone know how to set the title of a gnome-terminal from a script running the the gnome-terminal?
2009-10-16T03:08:00.000Z	pacifica		it is set to user@host:~$
2009-10-16T03:08:00.000Z	pacifica		which script?
2009-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	see "-t, --title=TITLE Set the terminal title" from "gnome-terminal --help-all".  good luck.  Eterm had that functionality back in the day as well.
2009-10-16T03:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	you're right!  i tried and failed ???
2009-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	that works like I'd expect it to work.... guess no-one uses gnome-terminal's titles on Ubuntu??
2009-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	i just installed eterm and it works there, "Eterm -n NameYouWant"...  gnome-terminal I don't know about sorry.  FYI it's not a good idea to be writing scripts that reply on a windows name for the gui - what if it's running in a shell?  Good luck.
2009-10-16T03:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	you need a !who and try and keep all you repsonses on 1 line - it's MUCH easier for everyone to follow stuff
2009-10-16T03:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	oh I will use them for menu shortcuts and odds and ends
2009-10-16T03:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	use TAB completion for nicks - mines still off ..ckK9 is wrong
2009-10-16T03:19:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	thanks :-)
2009-10-16T03:21:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	installed eterm .. but no eterm command?
2009-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	no thank you for fixing the nic thing - now it highlights :) - Linux is case senitive so it's "Eterm"
2009-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	right... let me try that .... :-)
2009-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	if you ask me it's a bug...
2009-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	is it a bug? (now it is :-P)
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	actually after reading my first google hit i doubt it is.  something to do with dynamic naming in gnome-terminal.
2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	its probably a "feature" ... like I said I think it does change it but then something else changes it back!
2009-10-16T03:26:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	guess I need to find a way to kill the "something else"
2009-10-16T03:35:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	found the problem.... even though /etc/bash.bashrc section is commented out
2009-10-16T03:35:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	its still in ~/.bashrc
2009-10-16T03:35:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	so after commenting out that bit, things like xtermset -T "title" work....
2009-10-16T03:35:00.000Z	pacifica	ZykoticK9	thanks for helping to think about this :-)
2009-10-16T03:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pacifica	"# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir" nice catch :)
