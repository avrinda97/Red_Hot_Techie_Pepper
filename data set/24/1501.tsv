2010-01-08T01:53:00.000Z	Diverdude		it seems one should remove all files using rm -r to uninstall matlab. Do ubuntu have some sort of central register like windows registration database?
2010-01-08T01:55:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	mind the space between the command and its option.
2010-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	if your problem is the same as mine, Xorg  hogs your CPU dearly. But then it stops.
2010-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	yes that might be it because Xorg is the top process in top...but it does not eat 100%
2010-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	what do you do then to remove the lag?
2010-01-08T02:10:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	it means Xorg has some decency left. But wait for the next releases...:).
2010-01-08T02:10:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	what is Xorg?
2010-01-08T02:12:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	 it's the graphics engine. But I don't know **** of it. Right now it's taking most of my CPU. It even slows down my typing. The good news is that it'll hopefully stop hogging your CPU all of a sudden. Probably after a couple of suspends.
2010-01-08T02:13:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	what comp are you running ubuntu on?
2010-01-08T02:14:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	it's a rather old 2GHz Dell Inspiron with 2GB RAM. Not bad, but with a single processor.
2010-01-08T02:16:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	i have lenovo t61p with dual core...should be good....but i think ubuntu is rather laggy anyway
2010-01-08T02:19:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	I also have the T60 with dual, but only Windoze there so far. But don't blame it on Ubuntu, it's the Xorg thing. It's some piece of old but continually updated piece of software with many many patches that make it a frankenstein. It's like Windows: flawed by design (I'm reflecting other's opinions here. I repeat I don't know a thing of Xorg).
2010-01-08T02:19:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	ahhh okay i see....i wonder if there is a way to replace Xorg with something better then
2010-01-08T02:21:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	it's ingrained in Linux (and all unices). Hopefully GNOME or KDE would take over it's low-level functions and come up with a better thing.
2010-01-08T02:21:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	i see...are there any plans on that?
2010-01-08T02:21:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	but that's years away in the best case.
2010-01-08T02:21:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	hmm damn
2010-01-08T02:21:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	is it a big module?
2010-01-08T02:22:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	what's more, you can blame most of your system crashes on graphics-engine related issues.
2010-01-08T02:23:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	hmm when was xorg created?
2010-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	it's not a module. See it like an onion: on the center is the kernel, then the shell, then the graphics engine, then the desktop systems (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) and then the applications. Sort of.
2010-01-08T02:25:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	ohhh i kinda thought that all nix system was as opposed to windows systems module based
2010-01-08T02:26:00.000Z	lgc	Diverdude	Windoze is also layer-based. On the center is DOS and its components and then the graphical interface. I suppose this is a common paradigm of operating systems design.
2010-01-08T02:33:00.000Z	Diverdude	lgc	so xorg is the weak point of linux?
