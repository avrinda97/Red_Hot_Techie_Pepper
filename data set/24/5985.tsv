2006-03-11T16:34:00.000Z	V4Vendetta		i have the newest source for gtkpod, how do i install it
2006-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	V4Vendetta		pete@Ace:~/Stuff/libgpod-0.3.2$ sudo apt-get build-deps gtkpod
2006-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	V4Vendetta		E: Invalid operation build-deps
2006-03-11T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	build-dep
2006-03-11T16:37:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	install it? "sudo checkinstall". install checkinstall first. and you should read the howto as well
2006-03-11T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	type "echo $PATH". do you have /usr/local/bin there?
2006-03-11T16:42:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	(also, you really should do "sudo checkinstall" rather than "sudo make install")
2006-03-11T16:43:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	was the previous version installed using APT?
2006-03-11T16:43:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	ok
2006-03-11T16:45:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	never used gtkpod, sorry
2006-03-11T16:46:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	i don't know. anyway it doesn't smell like something you'd want to run via sudo
2006-03-11T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	i've got that, but i don't have a solution. though i could guess that you don't have permissions on /mnt/ipod or whatever applies
2006-03-12T09:29:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	don't have a GUI
2006-03-12T09:29:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	'cause that's my server. my own desktop computer is quite firewalled, as it can take no inbound connections at all
2006-03-12T09:31:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	HymnToLife: that's a debian machine actually, it's been running for like 3 years or so... of course i do have a gui on my pc ;) but every connection to the network goes through that box
2006-03-14T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	Raovq : you're right, it's my fault. i was doing that on SSH to my Debian, didn't notice
2006-03-14T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	("doing that" i mean the apt-cache show)
2006-03-16T11:02:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	sudo updates-alternatives --config java
2006-03-16T11:02:00.000Z	V4Vendetta	LjL	okay thanks
2006-03-16T11:02:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	update-alternatives, actualy
2006-03-16T11:09:00.000Z	V4Vendetta	LjL	how do i remove these java's ? 1        /usr/bin/gij-wrapper-4.0
2006-03-16T11:09:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	sudo aptitude remove gij
2006-03-16T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	V4Vendetta	you probably want to sudo aptitude remove gcj as well
2006-03-16T11:11:00.000Z	V4Vendetta	LjL	thanks
