2008-04-14T21:34:00.000Z	tyler		and I found the cube
2008-04-14T21:34:00.000Z	tyler		so how I use the cube?
2008-04-14T21:35:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Set up cube rotation.
2008-04-14T21:24:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Look into compiz fusion, the Advanced Desktop Effects Settings lets you play around a lot with the exact settings for the cube and so forth.
2008-04-14T21:26:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Synaptic.  Just search for compiz.
2008-04-14T21:29:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 There should be a package called compiz-fusion-plugins-extra and another called compiz-fusion-plugins-main.
2008-04-14T21:30:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 You'll want those too.
2008-04-14T21:31:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 I think you probably also want libcompizconfig0.
2008-04-14T21:32:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Once all those are installed, under System, Preferences, there should be a new option called, "Advanced Desktop Settings Manager"
2008-04-14T21:32:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Tweak that to your heart's content.  You can adjust things like the distance the cube recedes when you rotate it, how transparent it becomes, the exact key/mouse bindings, etc. etc.
2008-04-14T21:33:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 I'm not sure I understand quite what you mean by desktop thingy.
2008-04-14T21:34:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Sure, I guess.
2008-04-14T21:36:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 If you're using the Advanced Desktop Effects Settings thing I told you to, you can adjust a huge amount of things involving how the cube works.
2008-04-14T21:37:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Just search for 'wine' in Synaptic.
2008-04-14T21:38:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 Well, if it's not Linux, I have no idea how we just managed to set up Desktop Effects for you.
2008-04-14T21:40:00.000Z	swuboo	tyler	 No, I don't believe there's any antivirus installed by default.
