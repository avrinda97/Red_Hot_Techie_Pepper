2012-05-10T12:27:00.000Z	_Matze_		How can I use the data of a broken down Ubuntu-VM from another Ubuntu-VM ?
2012-05-10T12:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 have the new vm instance  attatch the broken instances hd image to the new vm session as a 2nd hd is one way
2012-05-10T12:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	  booting a live cd iso may be easier . ;0
2012-05-10T12:30:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      how can I boot a live cd iso?
2012-05-10T12:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 tell the vm to boot it. using its settings
2012-05-10T12:32:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      VMware-player or the VM-OS itself?
2012-05-10T12:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 im not clear on what yiou mean. if you want to access a messed up vm disk image.. boot an iso in the VM
2012-05-10T12:34:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      I want to access a messed up guest OS but I don't know if it's aviable as an Iso..
2012-05-10T12:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 any linux iso should work.
2012-05-10T12:36:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      but how can I tell it, what VM-OS to access?
2012-05-10T12:38:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      I have another Ubuntu on VMware-player. can I maybe access the other ubuntu from there?
2012-05-10T12:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 if i had a broken vm in vbox. i would start that vm session in vbox.  but befor i powered it on 'virtually' i would have it insert the iso in to the virtual cd drive.. so its in fact booting the cd.... same as you would for a real pc.
2012-05-10T12:40:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      Ah, so I need a virtual cd drive
2012-05-10T12:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 thats a noirmal feature of all these vm's
2012-05-10T12:41:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      okay.. how do I get to this GRUB or however the bootmenu is called?
2012-05-10T12:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 err. you are booting the iso. that gets to the  'live desktop' you then access your hd as you would if it was on a real machine.   Im not sure what bootmenu you are refering to
2012-05-10T12:44:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      I thought of the one,, where I can select the boot device
2012-05-10T12:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 i dont use vmware. only vbox.. so no idea if its set to boot the iso by default or not..
2012-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      I can click my UBUNTU and select: "Start virtual machine"
2012-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      and if I install VirtualBox ? Could I then access my old VMware-Ubuntu?
2012-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 you may need to convert the HD images to a differnt format.
2012-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 if you converted the HD images to 'raw' format - i think you could mount them directly
2012-05-10T12:48:00.000Z	_Matze_	dr_willis	      I'm running Ubuntu in a VM: Guest Ubuntu, Host WinXP
2012-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	_Matze_	 so load the vm app, tweak its settings to mount/boot the iso file.. and let it boot up.
