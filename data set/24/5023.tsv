2006-11-11T06:08:00.000Z	Merkidemis		Could someone assist me with getting my latop's ATI graphics card running right?  I can get into xwindows fine, but the redraw is really, really slow
2006-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	Merkidemis		its an ATI Mobility X200
2006-11-11T06:09:00.000Z	Merkidemis		I have tried reinstalling fglrx, but it doesn't work
2006-11-11T06:10:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	do you have Option "NoAccel" "true" in your xorg.conf file?
2006-11-11T06:11:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	no, but I do have composite set to disabled, as on the forums people said that could be an option
2006-11-11T06:11:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	problem, not option
2006-11-11T06:12:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	It was working fine under Dapper, but got messed up when I dist-upgraded to Edgy
2006-11-11T06:12:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	I also have composite disabled and for 2D my card works pretty fast. I know it works slow in my case if I disable acceleration... but in your case the problem seems to be another issue
2006-11-11T06:13:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	edgy messed a lot of things... fonts in gnome, xservers, etc. :(
2006-11-11T06:13:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	Yeah, and I've been pouring over the forums for days trying to get it working.
2006-11-11T06:13:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	is there an "easy" way to get back to dapper?
2006-11-11T06:14:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	I don't know probably not easier as reinstalling from scratch everything and install your backup (if any)
2006-11-11T06:14:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	but probably your problem has a solution.
2006-11-11T06:14:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	Possible.  I'm not looking forward to fighting with my wi-fi again.  That was a simular nightmare
2006-11-11T06:15:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	well I am really dissapointed with that edgy release, I expected more from ubuntu, really. Just a small rant :)
2006-11-11T06:16:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	heh, yeah.  I remember my other attempts at Debian all getting messed up when updating.
2006-11-11T06:16:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	Is there a way to purge all the ATI stuff from the system, go back to VESA, and try installing an older driver?
2006-11-11T06:17:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	well now that xorg is modularized it should be easy, I mean just uninstall all packages with dpkg -l | grep ati, but this can be dangerous too
2006-11-11T06:18:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	right, but if the worst that happens is I reinstall dapper again, then its no big loss and a learning experience
2006-11-11T06:19:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	if you have your /home or your important files in another partition it should not be any problem too. OTOH in my case the fglrx drivers from ati were also crap and freezed my machine
2006-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	is there another driver I should try?  (Backups are easy, I have a 1.27TB server for that)
2006-11-11T06:21:00.000Z	therealbigusdick	Merkidemis	I've never tried with anything different than ati or fglrx on this machine... so I am not really sure. you could try vesa
2006-11-11T06:22:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	well, I think al I have tried is the one I downloaded from ATI.  Is there a second one?
2006-11-11T06:23:00.000Z	Merkidemis	therealbigusdick	well, let me try the free ati ones
