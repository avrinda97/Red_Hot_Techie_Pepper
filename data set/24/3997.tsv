2007-08-11T14:32:00.000Z	Walls7		hmm its now working.. doesn anyone know the command to open the menu file in GRUB?
2007-08-11T05:05:00.000Z	Walls7		Is there a 'correct' way to delete ubuntu, or do i just delete the partion its on?
2007-08-11T05:06:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	do you have another system on you PC (Windows?)
2007-08-11T05:06:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	yea
2007-08-11T05:07:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	If you just delete the partition you will get trouble booting as the boot-manager will lose it's configuration (which is on that partition).
2007-08-11T05:07:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	so what should i do?
2007-08-11T05:08:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	you might want to check if "grub" supports something to uninstall/remove it from the "MBR". I've never done that though
2007-08-11T05:08:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	alternatively...
2007-08-11T05:09:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	you could just delete the partition, boot the pc from a boot-disk and re-format the MBR with a windows tool. I *think* "fdisk /mbr" does the job
2007-08-11T05:09:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	you might want to google about this though. Before screwing up ;)
2007-08-11T05:10:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	i tried to do that using windows recovery but recovery didnt work
2007-08-11T05:11:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	windwows recovery might not be a good idea.
2007-08-11T05:11:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	you should get into the command-prompt of windows and execute the fdisk command
2007-08-11T05:11:00.000Z	Walls7		what was the command again?
2007-08-11T05:12:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	what was the fdisk command? fdisk/mdr?
2007-08-11T05:13:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	so while ubuntu is still installed, run fdisk/mdr in the windows cmd?
2007-08-11T05:15:00.000Z	Walls7		after i run fdisk/mdr do i then delete the ubuntu partion useing the live cd??
2007-08-11T05:15:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	"mbr"... but yes. You should first see if 1) Windows resides on you "first" partitin, and 2) "fdisk /mbr" in fact *does* restore the original mbr.
2007-08-11T05:16:00.000Z	exhuma		prtition*
2007-08-11T05:16:00.000Z	exhuma		partition* args....
2007-08-11T05:17:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	than delete the ubuntu partion with the live cd?
2007-08-11T05:18:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	once you restored the MBR you can just reboot the machine and it will skip the boot-loader and run windows.
2007-08-11T05:18:00.000Z	exhuma	Walls7	Then you can delete the partition from within windows
2007-08-11T05:18:00.000Z	Walls7	exhuma	thanks ill try that
