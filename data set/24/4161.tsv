2007-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	guris		I don't get promt or terminal
2007-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	guris		There is no command line it just says cannot boot
2007-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	guris		It give me error messages about there is no drivers and cannot boot to X
2007-09-22T12:31:00.000Z	guris		and there is very long log
2007-09-22T12:32:00.000Z	guris		Thank I guess that's what I will  do. just reinstall it
2007-09-22T12:32:00.000Z	guris		Thanks
2007-09-22T12:32:00.000Z	guris		yes It is other partition
2007-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	guris		Will I loose my programs then?
2007-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	guris		not  on the same they are on different partitions
2007-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	you'll need to reinstall your programs in either case, but your settings and data would be preserved if /home isn't reformatted
2007-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	what do you see when you boot up?
2007-09-22T12:30:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	that is a different, more serious problem
2007-09-22T12:31:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	booting and starting X are two completely different things
2007-09-22T12:32:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	reinstalls can be less painful under Linux, *IF* /home is its own partition
2007-09-22T12:33:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	if /home is on the same partition as root, you'll probably want to try making a copy somehom with a liveCD
2007-09-22T12:34:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	but if it's on the same partition as root, you'll need to back them up as they'll be wiped out.  You could run cfdisk or similar to create new partitions, and then copy your old /home into the partition you want for /home
2007-09-22T12:35:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	what I've been doing is making a 12 GB (12.9 pseudogigabyte) partition at the flont of the drive for root, create a four GB partition at the end for swap, and make everything in between /home
2007-09-22T12:37:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	what I describe is just one way to do it
2007-09-22T12:37:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	it's the way that has worked best for me
2007-09-22T12:37:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	just make sure that you back up what's on your /home that's part of root before you lose everything
2007-09-22T12:38:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	good luck
2007-09-22T12:39:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	yes, but you'll need to ask someone else about resizing partitions
2007-09-22T12:39:00.000Z	Strangelv	guris	I've never done it
