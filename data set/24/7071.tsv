2006-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	joosep		what is an art manager, thegladiator
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	joosep		i have restarted X and still none of them work. they work in the preview mode though thegladiator
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	joosep		switch gives that error when i press apply : Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkentry.c: line 440 (gtk_entry_set_text): assertion `text != NULL' failed.
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	joosep		well, i'd really like to get gtk1 application to look nicer
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	joosep		the fonts are plain horrible
2006-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	joosep		sadly i don't have the hardware for that, evilsmevil
2006-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	joosep		that changes GTK _2_ fonts yes, but not GTK _1_
2006-03-02T17:10:00.000Z	joosep		such as mplayer or xmms or aMule
2006-03-02T17:10:00.000Z	joosep		i'm not that dumb :P
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	joosep		why won't xmms start anymore after a restart?
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	are you using breezy ?
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	did you perform any updates since your last update/upgrade ?
2006-03-02T13:35:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	have you tried disabling, said plugins ?
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	you may have mangled your config files, try "sudo dpkg -P xmms" - that will remove and purge all associated conf/setting files
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	then reinstall it
2006-03-02T13:38:00.000Z	joosep	p0windah	still no change :O
2006-03-02T13:39:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	without any error messages... try apt-get update; apt-get install --reinstall xmms
2006-03-02T13:40:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	aside from that, are you sure that you do indeed have sound working ?
2006-03-02T13:41:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	yes, that was before you rebooted - I mean can you elicit sound from any other application on your machine "now"
2006-03-02T13:41:00.000Z	joosep	p0windah	i didn't reboot, X crashed and i had to restart X. sorry if i confused you
2006-03-02T13:41:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	oic, open a terminal and type "ps ax | grep xmms"
2006-03-02T13:42:00.000Z	joosep	p0windah	there are 3 instances of xmms running
2006-03-02T13:42:00.000Z	p0windah	joosep	"killall xmms"
2006-03-02T13:42:00.000Z	joosep	p0windah	plus grep xmms
