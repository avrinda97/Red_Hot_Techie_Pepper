2010-06-02T17:55:00.000Z	arunkumar413		i downloaded a new icon set from gnome artwork webiste. help me how to install the icons set
2010-06-02T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 drag/drop it into the appearances 'tool' window where you set your themes. and it should install it..  then youmay need to select customize to actually use the icon theme
2010-06-02T17:57:00.000Z	arunkumar413	Dr_Willis	but the icon set is not getting activated
2010-06-02T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 try the customize button. It could also be its not a full icon theme set.
2010-06-02T17:59:00.000Z	arunkumar413	Dr_Willis	ya,it seems that it's not a complete icon set
2010-06-27T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 so? theres proberly 30 to choose from
2010-06-27T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 huh?
2010-12-18T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 since its not a ubuntu official package (yet?) you may need to check the libreoffice forums/support channels/ ubuntu forums also may help
2010-12-18T13:47:00.000Z	arunkumar413	Dr_Willis	ok,thnaks
2010-12-23T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 you will need to decide on what OS and grub version to use to handle all the grub booting. then learn some grub skills. and perhaps  do a bit of manual grub configuration.
2010-12-23T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 move their /boot/ stuff to some boot partition then. and fix up grub to boot from there. It may take some work.
2010-12-23T18:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 theres not going to be a 'one click its done' fix for a comple xsetup like that.
2010-12-23T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 its possible that ubuntu's grtub2  setup may see/auto add the other OS's but i dont use mandriva so no idea if it can
2011-01-02T14:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 some programs come as debs that auto-add their own repos to the system to keep  them updated. googles tuff does that and so do a few other apps.
2011-01-06T19:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 find the debs...
2011-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 dont use alien.. theres repos out for it also i think
2011-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 if you want to risk trashing your system.. then try the rpms..
2011-01-06T19:36:00.000Z	arunkumar413	Dr_Willis	The libre office website has rpm only
2011-01-06T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 i saw some debs some where on a blog post ing last week.
2012-08-08T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 ive seen several online. and for my Android phone. Not really looked in the repos for them I imagine theres some.
2012-08-08T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	   visual-regexp - Interactively debug regular expressions
2012-08-08T03:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	   visual-regexp - Interactively debug regular expressions   - check the repos for othhers.. i just did a quick search
2012-08-08T04:33:00.000Z	arunkumar413	Dr_Willis	i want to select the conditions for text to find and the program should create the regular expression not that i have to hard code the regular expression and test it. I just want to select the logic and text and the program should create the regular expression'
2012-08-08T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arunkumar413	 good luck.
