2011-03-27T20:58:00.000Z	hvnsweeting		hi all, i've installed blender and when i run it, it only show the splash screen and doesn't hide it. I can click on menus. It doesn't show anything about error when i ran it from terminal. How can i fix this, thanks!
2011-03-27T20:59:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	have you tried re-installing it? what version(s) of python do you have?
2011-03-27T20:59:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	not yet, python 2.6.5
2011-03-27T21:00:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	that should work. so you see a splash screen, but it never loads the main GUI?
2011-03-27T21:01:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	what are you using? GNOME, KDE, etc?
2011-03-27T21:01:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	gnome
2011-03-27T21:01:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	are you using compiz?
2011-03-27T21:02:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	i set my visual effect at extra but i don't use compiz
2011-03-27T21:02:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	how does that work?
2011-03-27T21:02:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	what works?
2011-03-27T21:03:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	visual effects are compiz.
2011-03-27T21:03:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	what version of Ubuntu?
2011-03-27T21:03:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	okay, i will change it to normal, 10.04
2011-03-27T21:05:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	i changed to normal and no visual but nothing happen
2011-03-27T21:05:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	odd... has blender always been this way (you can set your effects back now)
2011-03-27T21:06:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	 this is the first time i install it
2011-03-27T21:06:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	 maybe i will remove it and reinstall
2011-03-27T21:08:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	nothing else after reinstall, i install it from Ubuntu software center
2011-03-27T21:09:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	i use 10.10 and have 2.6.6 and 3.1 installed (with blender) and it works fine. Can you move the window to a different workspace?
2011-03-27T21:10:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	2.6.6 and 3.1 being different python versions.
2011-03-27T21:11:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	 ok, i will install new python ver
2011-03-27T21:17:00.000Z	hvnsweeting	cipherboy_loc	i want to ask that when i installed python3, will ubuntu use it to install blender?
2011-03-27T21:18:00.000Z	cipherboy_loc	hvnsweeting	blender (i think) only uses python for the extra modules but not sure. blender does not need to be compiled.
