2005-12-20T13:29:00.000Z	korhalf		if i dont have access to gui, is it still possible to make ssh start on bootup?
2005-12-20T13:29:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	sure
2005-12-20T15:29:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	quodlibet is written in python, very painful.
2005-12-20T15:30:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	why, whats wrong with python?
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	You would get a much shorter answer by asking what's NOT wrong with python.
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	are you kidding? python is one of the best languages around
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	i love python/ruby
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	I have no civil reply to that.  Please do not continue.
2005-12-20T15:31:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	well name a few things wrong with it though, even though you claim the list is so long
2005-12-20T15:32:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	Non-functional garbage collection.  Dreadful performance.  Ambiguous syntaxes.  Inconsistent whitespace significance.  Awful, horrible extension API.  Need I continue?
2005-12-20T15:33:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	The indentation would be fine if actually worked.  As the interpreter will allow you to use spaces instead of tabs, or worse, mix tabs and spaces, very weird things can happen.
2005-12-20T15:33:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	Of course, the little things like horrible performance don't bother me that much.  It's the absolutely, positively, totally broken garbage collection I find most deeply offensive.
2005-12-20T15:34:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	i really enjoy not managing my own memory, tryout quod libet regardless, its great, and thats python :P
2005-12-20T15:34:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	Garbage collection was a Solved Problem before I was born, before Python was a twinkle in a moron's eye.  And yet Guido thought he was just smarter than fifty years of research and went on to implement a totally broken garbage collection scheme.
2005-12-20T15:34:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	Heh, I have a very weird rhythmbox fork from before they switched to CVS that is very, very nice.  I do not think I will be abandoning it :P
2005-12-20T15:35:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	oh i see
2005-12-20T15:36:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	To add insult to injury, after it was discovered that the reference count gc didn't work (surprise, surprise), they didn't remove it because they didn't want to limit backwards compatibility with existing C modules.  Keep in mind that this decision was made when python had like, five users.
2005-12-20T15:37:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	So, as a result, today, we have a language which will, no matter what, leak memory.  If you use *any* external module in your python script, even some of the ones that come with the base python distribution, your python program will leak.  This is a pisser because it didn't have to be this way.
2005-12-20T15:38:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	People will continue to use AGP for quite a few years yet, bud.
2005-12-20T15:39:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	PCI-E doesn't provide enough juice
2005-12-20T15:39:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	And OEMs don't like filthy hacks.
2005-12-20T15:39:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	I'm certain AGP was just temporary
2005-12-20T15:39:00.000Z	korhalf	pipeline	I used to run my Radeon chip on AGP till i realized i didnt want 20 FPS whilst playing CS:S
2005-12-20T15:39:00.000Z	pipeline	korhalf	Well, as long as you have to plug cables from the power supply into the graphics card to make it work, there will continue to be a market for AGP cards.
