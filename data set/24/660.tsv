2011-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	Chubcorp		I have a question regarding my computer recognizing the battery.
2011-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	Chubcorp		Unless the battery is less than 5 min from full charge, the computer shuts down when it's unplugged.
2011-04-08T07:03:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	it sounds like you leave your laptop plugged in all the time
2011-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	It is likely that you need a new battery. Only plugging it in when it's almost dead, and then unplugging when it's fully charged will make it last longer. There is nothing you can do about it, unless it's under warranty
2011-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	unless of course, it is fine with another currently installed os
2011-04-08T07:05:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	it does work fine on Windows
2011-04-08T07:06:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	have you checked your power settings under system>preferences?
2011-04-08T07:07:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	I take it back. There are other settings somewhere. I don't remember where. Look in synaptic for "laptop"
2011-04-08T07:07:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	 when it gets unplugged it says 3 min of battery remaining unless plugged back in. still turns off even if it's plugged back in
2011-04-08T07:08:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	well that's not right.
2011-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	what happens if you log in to windows and charge it, then switch back?
2011-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	It won't turn off if it's fully charged, just below a 90% charge
2011-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	it sounds like your computer is borked
2011-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	is there anything noteworthy in the bios related to power?
2011-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	no, nothing
2011-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	perhaps a setting for apic or apm
2011-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	My computer has trouble with a lot of things like this, I cannot update the system, it will crash the OS, and it wasn't until I installed Poulsbo 2d and 3d that I could change screen resolution
2011-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	Perhaps I should just live with it
2011-04-08T07:14:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	perhaps you could shut down, remove the battery for a bit and then plug it back in and charge while powered off. then boot and try again
2011-04-08T07:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	do you have candlewax, a leatherman, and a pinch of hair?
2011-04-08T07:15:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	yes, but this might be a weird fix.
2011-04-08T07:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	I may know an incantation, but the smell of fire will soothe your soul.
2011-04-08T07:17:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Chubcorp	sorry, you'll need a blowtorch too. (jk). It sounds like someone else knows more about poulsomethingsomething than I.
2011-04-08T07:24:00.000Z	Chubcorp	Seven_Six_Two	ohsix, Thanks, but I'll just deal with it for now, Plus, big paper due soon. Thanks again
