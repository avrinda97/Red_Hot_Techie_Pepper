2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	jirwin		it is a envision en-910
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	jirwin		I have like crazy
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	jirwin		?
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	jirwin		can't do what?
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	jirwin		well the thing is, I got this new monitor from a friend...and in xorg.conf it didn't probe it at all. So it just says 'generic monitor'.
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	jirwin		I want to have the full resolution of 1600x1200 instead of 1024x768
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	jirwin		so I though I should add the horiz and vert rates
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	jirwin		yah I can
2006-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	jirwin		it just installed ati drivers...and those work great.
2006-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	jirwin		except...I can't get the resolution I want.
2006-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	slept	jirwin	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, or edit xorg.conf
2006-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	jirwin		OSX and Windows
2006-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	jirwin		I realize this. I can't find the specs for it though
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	jirwin		http://rafb.net/paste/results/MkhV1d17.html
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	jirwin		that is my xorg.conf
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	jirwin		i know that that is the correct horiz...but not sure on the vert.
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	slept	jirwin	read-edid can get them for you
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	jirwin		correct
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	jirwin		but I made up the vert
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	jirwin	slept	what is read-edid?
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	slept		qq, resolution has nothing to do with distros its about configuration
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	jirwin		would vert be labeled as anything else?
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	slept	jirwin	a package ... apt-get
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	slept	jirwin	when you installed it use it like that:  get-edid |parse-edid
