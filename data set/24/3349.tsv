2008-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	mattgrieser		I don't want to step on toes, but I had a linux question. Is there a protocol to getting help here?
2008-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	mattgrieser		!ask ?
2008-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	:) thats the protocol
2008-02-15T07:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	the whole question about snippets ::: best chances of having someone who knows answer
2008-02-15T07:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	this "date" file is just a sample that came with the program?
2008-02-15T07:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	did you try reinstalling the program so you get the file back?
2008-02-15T07:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	why not reinstall?
2008-02-15T07:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	if you're concerned about that, you could try copying the configuration files (though i don't think reinstalling would overwrite them)
2008-02-15T07:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	check this --> ls -al | grep snippits
2008-02-15T07:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	or just ls -al if you want to spot it yourself
2008-02-15T07:32:00.000Z	mattgrieser	prince_jammys	ok, i see it... now what
2008-02-15T07:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	also .... did you just move the date file but don't know where it is?
2008-02-15T07:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	is there a file or folder DOTsnippits
2008-02-15T07:32:00.000Z	mattgrieser	prince_jammys	no, I said --> rm ~/.snippits/date
2008-02-15T07:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	ok , so it's gone.   copy that configuration file somewhere, like cp .snippits snippitsbackup
2008-02-15T07:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	don't put a dot in front of the backup , and it wont be a hidden file
2008-02-15T07:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	you may get an error if its a folder and not a file... if you do, replace cp with cp -r
2008-02-15T07:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	this, btw is almost definitely unnecessary, but since you're afraid to lose the configuration, might as well copy
2008-02-15T07:36:00.000Z	mattgrieser	prince_jammys	Thanks. it copied fine with cp -r
2008-02-15T07:37:00.000Z	mattgrieser	prince_jammys	I'll try reinstalling
2008-02-15T07:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	after you double check that the copy is there, look around to see any other snippits stuff, though i doubt -- copy if you find any and reinstall
2008-02-15T07:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mattgrieser	the DOTfiles in your home are personal settings for your programs, and are hidden by default so they don't get in your way....
2008-02-15T07:42:00.000Z	mattgrieser	prince_jammys	the install worked, and "cp date ~/.snippits/date" from the recreated example file worked fine. Now I can say 14-Feb-08 _so_ easily!!! Thank you for the help.
