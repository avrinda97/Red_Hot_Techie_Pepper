2006-10-08T14:15:00.000Z	peace-keeper		i have an athlon500 and 768mb ram, and winxp is about twice as fast as ubuntu
2006-10-08T14:16:00.000Z	peace-keeper		no, hard disk
2006-10-08T14:17:00.000Z	peace-keeper		face the truth, linux is nice for techies, but as a desktop OS it's slower and less reliable than win xp :)
2006-10-08T14:18:00.000Z	peace-keeper		just saying my experience, ive spent a lot of time on ubuntu
2006-10-08T14:19:00.000Z	peace-keeper		and dont insult me plz
2006-10-08T14:19:00.000Z	peace-keeper		i dont insult anyone
2006-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	peace-keeper		i just say that as a desktop OS i find ubuntu slower, more complicated and less reliable than win xp
2006-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	peace-keeper		if its not allowed to say that in here, kick me out
2006-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	peace-keeper		1: it's twice as fast on my machine, 2. i does not crash every day, 3. it is much easier to use (ok i understand the last one may be a matter of learning..)
2006-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	peace-keeper		dont get me wrong, i like linux, but as a desktop OS it's still disappointing for me
2006-10-08T14:22:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Indeed, sucks much less than windows, though - the best I've seen is probably Mac OS X.
2006-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Are you hitting swap?
2006-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Open a console, run top, hit 'M', sorting tasks by memory useage, and show us the output.
2006-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Which drivers are you using?
2006-10-08T14:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Just install the latest proprietary NVidia drivers, and ignore the 'nv' drivers.
2006-10-08T14:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	nvidia is widely regarded as being the best of the closed drivers.
2006-10-08T14:29:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Install the nvidia drivers.
2006-10-08T14:35:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Install the latest damn nvidia driver.
2006-10-08T14:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Why are you against installing up-to-date drivers?
2006-10-08T14:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	WHY DON'T YOU INSTALL THE LATEST DRIVERS? That's three times I've asked.
2006-10-08T14:38:00.000Z	peace-keeper	Arafangion	cause they dont support my old card
2006-10-08T14:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	I'm sure they do.
2006-10-08T14:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	Incorrect.
2006-10-08T14:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	peace-keeper	The reason why MS is #1 is because it's installed by default on every single system, due to various nefarious monopolistic practices that has brought them to court several times.
