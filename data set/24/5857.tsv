2007-09-04T13:23:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	uninstalling google earth
2007-09-04T13:23:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	i entered the commands but only one of them works
2007-09-04T13:24:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	what was the output?
2007-09-04T13:24:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	use a pastebin if it's more than 1 or 2 lines.
2007-09-04T13:24:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	actually, wait: that's not MANY commands that's ONE command.  :)
2007-09-04T13:24:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	http://pastebin.com/m55e21321
2007-09-04T13:25:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	don't hit enter at the end of each line, paste them all together with a space between each line, then press enter
2007-09-04T13:25:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	let me try that
2007-09-04T13:26:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	';'
2007-09-04T13:27:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	http://pastebin.com/m52a478e9
2007-09-04T13:28:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	is it removed, though?  what happens if you type 'googleearth' into a console now?
2007-09-04T13:29:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	it says: bash: googleearth: command not foud
2007-09-04T13:30:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	so, yeah, i'd say it's removed.  :)
2007-09-04T13:30:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	it's still listed under "internet" in the applications menu
2007-09-04T13:31:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	what does clicking on it do?
2007-09-04T13:31:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	let me see
2007-09-04T13:31:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	it runs the program
2007-09-04T13:32:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	maybe if i enter the directory where i downloaded the bin file it could work
2007-09-04T13:32:00.000Z	godlygeek	jacob_	no, that doesn't make a difference
2007-09-04T13:32:00.000Z	jacob_	godlygeek	ok
