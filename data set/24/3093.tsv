2009-06-29T01:28:00.000Z	xy_42		i am using ubuntu 8.04.  my web cam is not showing the proper colors.  i am using ekiga.
2009-06-29T01:28:00.000Z	xy_42		what could be the problem?
2009-06-29T01:29:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	try if it works correctly with cheese first
2009-06-29T01:31:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	doesn't seem to work with cheese.  i get the rainbow colors and no image at all
2009-06-29T01:32:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	then you should take a look at wich cam driver you've loaded
2009-06-29T01:33:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	how can I check?  dmesg only has this
2009-06-29T01:33:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	you should first verify which device your system sees as the cam, lsusb -v
2009-06-29T01:36:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	that gives a lot of output.  is there something in particular i need to check?
2009-06-29T01:36:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	something that talks about a cam :)
2009-06-29T01:38:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	iProduct                1 USB camera
2009-06-29T01:38:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	nothing else? just that?
2009-06-29T01:39:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	yes.  sudo lsusb -v  | grep -i cam give that
2009-06-29T01:40:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	but probably theres more that you don't get with the grep... can you pastebin it?
2009-06-29T01:46:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	the cam is external or it's embedded on a laptop? and which ubuntu version are you using?
2009-06-29T01:46:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	it is external.  i am on 8.04.2
2009-06-29T01:48:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	do you have the desktop visual effects activated?
2009-06-29T01:51:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	it was off
2009-06-29T01:52:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	no, no
2009-06-29T01:52:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	they use produce problems like the one you describe very often
2009-06-29T01:53:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	i've found a forum thread that talks about your cam and its driver: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=375005, perhaps you should take a look at it
2009-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	how do i know which is my cam model?  I have forgotten it and it was not one of the well known brands
2009-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	papapep	xy_42	microdia
2009-06-29T01:54:00.000Z	xy_42	papapep	thanks, i will take a look
