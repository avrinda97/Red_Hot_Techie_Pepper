2007-08-17T15:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	if you go to Places/Computer, do you see an icon for your new drive?
2007-08-17T15:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	i already tried to help you and you jdidn't answer.
2007-08-17T15:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	are you listening, or are you just trying to be annoying?
2007-08-17T15:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	if you're gonna talk to me, prefix your line with my name, or i won't respond, cuz i won't see the text scroll by
2007-08-17T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	if you see the drive there, then its probably just not in the proper file format for you to use it(its probably ntfs)....
2007-08-17T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	is the new drive for windows, or is it for ubuntu, or both?
2007-08-17T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	you probably need to chmod it so you have permission to use it.
2007-08-17T15:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	ok, and what happens when you try to write to it?.. do you get a permission not granted, or something like that?
2007-08-17T15:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	you do not have permission to edit the drive, thus why you can't us it...., you need to give your user privileges of the device.
2007-08-17T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	what messages?
2007-08-17T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	type this w/o quotes.. "/join #indygunfreak"
2007-08-31T13:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	did you put it in an external enclosure, or is it internal, or wha?
2007-08-31T13:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	you probably need to chmod it.
2007-08-31T13:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	beans1337	i'm not 100% sure, its a chmod command though.
