2007-11-19T20:49:00.000Z	bieb		Anyone here know how the Dell Vostro 1000 laptop fairs with Ubuntu support?
2007-11-19T20:50:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	what are the specs?
2007-11-19T20:53:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	if it's for general use--you're golden; something else in mind? or certain issues you have?
2007-11-19T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	you should download the livecd and try it out, see how much of your hardware, wireless it can recognize
2007-11-19T20:55:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	haven't heard about that particular model, heard about the 1400 something--good reviews on that you might want to check ubuntuforums for that model though
2007-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	does it run fairly smoothly--does the system recognize your wireless card,etc?
2007-12-19T23:37:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	just look in the network settings once booted? or should I use dmesg or something like that
2007-12-19T23:38:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	do the restricted driver manager show the card driver?
2007-12-19T23:39:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	I haven't purchased the laptop yet. I want to try to test it at the store before purchase
2007-12-19T23:39:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	best to google and check ubuntuforums as well linux on laptops website first then
2007-12-19T23:41:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	thanks
2007-12-19T23:42:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	no worries :}
2008-02-12T22:00:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	#3
2008-07-23T20:19:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	adblockplus is an extension?
2008-07-23T20:12:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	how many extensions
2008-07-23T20:14:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	the only extension is the "Ubuntu Firefox Modifications 0.5"
2008-07-23T20:14:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	how much ram, what other special effects (ie compiz) running, how many flash tabs open etc
2008-07-23T20:16:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	2gb RAM, no special effects.. currently 3 tabs with flash (it is the side ads on howtoforge.org)
2008-07-23T20:17:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	is that link for me??
2008-07-23T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	imo get adblockplus, limit open flash tabs for starters
2008-07-23T20:19:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	yes
2008-07-23T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	bieb	I would also check if you have any fancy themes going; some are not that well done and could conflict with ff
2008-07-23T20:22:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	I am boring, I use the standard theme that installs by default with Ubuntu
2012-05-16T19:23:00.000Z	bieb	bazhang	is it the same for 12.04? I thought I has seen somewhere that you apt-get gnome-session-fallback  I haven't been able to confirm that though
