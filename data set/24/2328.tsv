2009-02-04T03:26:00.000Z	z-e		redvamp128?
2009-02-04T03:26:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 go ahead and ask
2009-02-04T03:27:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 I am reading about jnettop
2009-02-04T03:28:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	it appears as though once you have set it up-- you can use the Java based GUI
2009-02-04T03:29:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 I have never used that program so I don't know where to start to help you
2009-02-04T03:31:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 don't get upset-- I am actually reading about the program now-- it appears as though you need a .rpm to deb conversion  or compile from source
2009-02-04T03:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 I don't use the program-- but it appears as though they have a Java front end to change the settings
2009-02-04T03:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 jnettop wiki FrontPage <http://jnettop.kubs.info/wiki/>
2009-02-04T03:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 all I could find is some people chatting about network traffic issues --  http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/06mar/minutes/16ng.txt
2009-02-04T03:38:00.000Z	z-e	redvamp128	i appreciate for your help,...
2009-02-04T03:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 seems as if too many people try to view cams-- the connection is overrun
2009-02-04T03:39:00.000Z	z-e	redvamp128	i don't understand you
2009-02-04T03:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 I don't know where to start-- but that page with the chat log works for you or not but does reference the two issues you described above
2009-02-04T03:41:00.000Z	z-e	redvamp128	are you talking about UNKNOWNv4 <-> UNKNOWNv4  - ARP - 0.0.0.0 ??????
2009-02-04T03:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	z-e	 yes
2009-02-04T03:42:00.000Z	z-e	redvamp128	they are talking about something different...
2009-02-04T03:44:00.000Z	z-e	redvamp128	they are used similar words about different things... so, thanks again...
