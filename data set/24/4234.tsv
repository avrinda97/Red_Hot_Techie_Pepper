2007-09-04T10:37:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	i'll look at that link also.. thanks
2007-09-04T10:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Look at the part about public key authentication
2007-09-04T10:45:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	which ports are best?
2007-09-04T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	It depends on your isp, but using default ports you are more likely to be throttled
2007-09-04T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Look at the Azureus wiki on ports, it applies to all clients
2007-09-04T10:46:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	i picked off the wall ports.. in the 6000 range.. seems to work well for me
2007-09-04T11:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	that was not a link to any pirated anything..
2007-09-04T11:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Please keep to support and don't insult people
2008-08-22T03:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Have you tried anything like "mount -t hfs -o loop file.iso /mountpoint" ?
2008-08-22T04:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	This might be helpful http://vu1tur.eu.org/tools/
2008-08-22T04:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Not sure if I understand you wrong or if you didn't notice that you run that *after* converting the .dmg file to a .img file
2009-09-20T02:27:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	9.04 does not create an xorg.conf by default
2009-09-20T02:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Ok, then I'll just have him copy and paste
2009-09-20T02:29:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jordan_U	yup, it'll still obey any thing in xorg.conf but one is blank until created by the user.
2009-09-20T02:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bastid_raZor	Thanks for the heads up
