2008-12-02T18:40:00.000Z	alex_21		Anyone?
2008-12-02T18:41:00.000Z	alex_21		I can't use a front end theme manager, but I want to make my gdm login look like a Mac username - password style login. Can anyone walk me through set up via the command lne interface? I am blind, so help doing this visual stuff is appreciated greatly
2008-12-02T18:43:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> I can't, since I am blind
2008-12-02T18:43:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> CLI is the only way
2008-12-02T18:45:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> Yes, on a Mac, my native OS, but I maintain Ubuntu/Kbuntu/Xubuntu servers/desktops
2008-12-02T18:47:00.000Z	alex_21		<alex_21>: I need help in visually finding the right one that I need for this. Under OS X there is two logins, one with username and password text boxes and one with Icons. It is the first one I want

2008-12-02T18:50:00.000Z	alex_21		I don't need auto login. These aren't machines I use on a regular basis myself, rather those I support. They are multyuser machines though
2008-12-02T18:51:00.000Z	alex_21		<tomcheng76> I just need it to look like Mac OS X at login
2008-12-02T18:52:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	have you looked at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/doc/Guide? there's some information on 'Making the Login Accessible' if that helps?
2008-12-02T19:07:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	I think the download link is http://fc58.deviantart.com/fs39/f/2008/334/c/8/Apple_Mac_OSX_Session_Login_by_onedread.gz
2008-12-02T19:27:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	I think you can just add it under the [gui] section
2008-12-02T20:26:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	did you add "GraphicalTheme=osx-login" to /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom ?
2008-12-02T20:36:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	so did you add "GraphicalTheme=osx-login" to /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom ?
2008-12-02T20:37:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	gdm.conf-custom should override gdm.conf
2008-12-02T20:38:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	find the [gui] section, and add GraphicalTheme=osx-login under that
2008-12-02T20:39:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	I think that should be all that it takes... try restarting X
2008-12-02T20:41:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	Ctl+Alt+backspace should do it
2008-12-02T20:45:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	hmm... so you have 'GraphicalTheme=osx-login' in gdm.conf-custom ?
2008-12-02T20:46:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	and you copied the expanded osx-login directory to /usr/share/gdm/themes/ ?
2008-12-02T20:52:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	I'm going to restart my X using your gdm.conf-custom file and see if it works here... I'll be back in a moment
2008-12-02T20:58:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	it works fine on my system, but the interface is still not text based and it might seem the same to you as the original theme, is that a possibility?
2008-12-02T21:05:00.000Z	ndlovu	alex_21	then I don't know. You could try change "GraphicalTheme=Human" to "GraphicalTheme=osx-login" in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
