2009-04-10T12:46:00.000Z	mopoyo		i want to be able to do it myself next time
2009-04-10T12:48:00.000Z	mopoyo		i hate it when people just say google
2009-04-10T12:48:00.000Z	mopoyo		it's so stupid
2009-04-10T12:48:00.000Z	mopoyo		sure but not everything can be just solved by saying "google"
2009-04-10T12:48:00.000Z	mopoyo		not everyone is good at using google
2009-04-10T12:50:00.000Z	mopoyo		dam now my 8 series is now at the bottom :(!!!!!

2009-04-10T12:50:00.000Z	mopoyo		could anyone give me an estimate of how much faster the 200 series is compared to my 8800 ?
2009-04-10T12:51:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	Unless you have XP/Vista/7 for gaming, what use is an amazingly overpowered card, if you don't mind my asking?
2009-04-10T12:52:00.000Z	mopoyo	Surlent777	it looks cooler :)
2009-04-10T12:52:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	What does? Just the name?
2009-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	mopoyo	Surlent777	how do i  close X
2009-04-10T13:03:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	What do you need to do that for, exactly? What are you trying to do?
2009-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	I did that by setting up SSH
2009-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	mopoyo	Surlent777	do both computers need to be running ubuntu?
2009-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	no, you can use puTTY on Windows
2009-04-10T13:07:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	as they say, just google it. You need to have ssh-server or something close to that installed on any ubuntu computers, though, I think
2009-04-10T13:08:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	And then there's something about public keys that I don't quite get =( I personally just set up my firewalls to allow only each other on port 22 and deny all others. Sorry I can't be more helpful than that
2009-04-10T13:08:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	Oh, and if your router'd computers are using Windows and have their network crap set up right, you should be able to use Samba inside of Nautilus to access them
2009-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	see above
2009-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	It should just be able to pick them up under their usual name, such as WORKGROUP or MYHOME or whatever you call it
2009-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	Again, see above there
2009-04-10T13:10:00.000Z	Surlent777	mopoyo	no problem
