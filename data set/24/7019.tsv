2009-01-05T00:34:00.000Z	sageb1		linux will ID the wifi usb dongle
2009-01-05T00:36:00.000Z	sageb1		i dont have kids, i do have this nifty app that i compiled that gives you the chinese year as a astrology number and then translates it into the correct sign and elemental year
2009-01-05T00:36:00.000Z	sageb1		netszooc: try $ locate rtl8187 and see if a rtl8187.ko pops up
2009-01-05T00:37:00.000Z	sageb1		i get /lib/modules/[version]/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rtl8187/r8187.ko
2009-01-05T00:38:00.000Z	sageb1		does uname -a give you a version number of the right module?
2009-01-05T00:40:00.000Z	sageb1		my ex GF's computer is a 64 bit but telus had 32bit vista installed on it
2009-01-05T00:41:00.000Z	sageb1		so it was s-l-o-w,  but after upgrading memory from 512 MB to 2GB, that solved the delay
2009-01-05T00:41:00.000Z	sageb1		action, yes, i realized it wasnt the 32 bits
2009-01-05T00:42:00.000Z	sageb1		ilogic, have u tried?
2009-01-05T00:42:00.000Z	sageb1		perhaps lilo uses what's in /boot?
2009-01-05T00:43:00.000Z	Deep6	sageb1	shouldn't it first the mbr?
2009-01-05T00:43:00.000Z	sageb1	iLogic	do u have a 8.10 livecd?
2009-01-05T00:44:00.000Z	sageb1		deep6, depends on whether it's dualbooting microcruft or other
2009-01-05T00:44:00.000Z	sageb1		ilogic, does the livecd have envy?
2009-01-05T00:44:00.000Z	Deep6	sageb1	it's dual booting XP, but what's entirely weird is that if I have an XP cd in my drive, and DON'T boot into the setup, passes through to windows
2009-01-05T00:44:00.000Z	sageb1		or is that an extra ?
2009-01-05T00:45:00.000Z	Deep6		if I take the cd out, I get a corrupt lilo prompt I think L10IL0
2009-01-05T00:45:00.000Z	sageb1		deep6, that's ballmer voodoo, it is
2009-01-05T00:45:00.000Z	Deep6		and it'll boot into linux
2009-01-05T00:45:00.000Z	Deep6	sageb1	concurred, but a necessary evil
2009-01-05T00:46:00.000Z	sageb1		deep6 have u considered two hdd in that box of yours? or is it a laptop?
2009-01-05T00:46:00.000Z	Deep6		but rest assured linux outnumbers windows 10 fold in my house
2009-01-05T00:46:00.000Z	sageb1		and is it a laptop that can boot off USB cos 32GB USB flash drive dongles are on special now
2009-01-05T00:47:00.000Z	Deep6	sageb1	I have a 3 disks' my windows one is non raid, the other is a pair for real work aka ubuntu
