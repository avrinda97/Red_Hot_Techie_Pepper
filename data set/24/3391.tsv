2008-02-03T06:05:00.000Z	fleishman		Greetings, I am having trouble finding the package "compizconfig-settings-manager" in Synaptic.  It lists several compiz packages, all of which i have installed, but the settings manager is not listed as an option to install.  i have an Nvidia 8600GTS which i have the drives installed for.  how do i get compizconfig-settings-manager so that i can utilize the 3d effects?
2008-02-03T06:07:00.000Z	fleishman		anyone?  is there someplace i can get the "compizconfig-settings-manager" package that is not listed in Synaptic?  I'm running ubuntu 7.10
2008-02-03T06:08:00.000Z	bod_	fleishman	you need the correct repo's go into /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment all the lines beginning with deb
2008-02-03T06:09:00.000Z	bod_	fleishman	no probs,. then ccsm should be in synaptic
2008-02-03T06:11:00.000Z	fleishman	bod_	 i looked in that directory in File Browser and it is empty
2008-02-03T06:11:00.000Z	bod_	fleishman	if that file is empty then you should have 0 packages in Synaptic
2008-02-03T06:13:00.000Z	fleishman	bod_	ah, i'm a moron, i was in the folder sources.list.d
