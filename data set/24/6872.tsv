2005-12-14T06:34:00.000Z	collinder		ok im about to have a fresh install of ubuntu 5.1 on my desktop.... now will someone explain why nvidia drivers are such a bitch
2005-12-14T06:34:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-12-14T06:35:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	what does it say?
2005-12-14T06:37:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	near the end it will tell you the error
2005-12-14T06:38:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	yes?
2005-12-14T06:39:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	look for lines that have either "EE" or "!!" in them
2005-12-14T06:40:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	then look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-12-14T06:41:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	very well lol. I personally find it a challenge (one of the GOOD ones) to rescue my system without reinstalling
2005-12-14T06:42:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	Wait "other monitor"?
2005-12-14T06:43:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	Try disconnecting the second monitor...
2005-12-14T06:44:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	Multiple monitors is something I know nothing about lol. Lets see if the primary one works
2005-12-14T06:44:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	sure if you want
2005-12-14T06:46:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	okay
2005-12-14T06:48:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	then at least it isn't the monitor
2005-12-14T06:49:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-12-14T06:50:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	it doesn't matter
2005-12-14T06:52:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	X is up?
2005-12-14T06:53:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	I don't know if Voodoo is supported...
2005-12-14T06:55:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	yes, until you get the NVidia GLX
2005-12-14T06:55:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	Are you trying to run multiple monitors
2005-12-14T06:56:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	I can get your Hardware Accel working, but I know nothing about multiple monitors
2005-12-14T06:58:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	so is X working now?
2005-12-14T06:59:00.000Z	Kyral	collinder	What is connected now?
