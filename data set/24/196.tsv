2012-05-19T00:45:00.000Z	Peri_		i clicked to install the update last week and it froze, after restarting I now i have a nonfunctional comp and a 0 on an essay i had done...
2012-05-19T00:47:00.000Z	Peri_		why did ubuntu break my comp with an update?
2012-05-19T00:48:00.000Z	Peri_		at least windows doesn't pretend to be user friendly
2012-05-19T00:49:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	don't quote me on this but doing a rescue install might fix it
2012-05-19T00:49:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	just boot off the CD and go to install mode
2012-05-19T00:50:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	do you wanna fix your install or just get to your files
2012-05-19T00:52:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	did you try a different boot option?  rescue?  one of the older kernels?
2012-05-19T00:54:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	it'll reinstall the OS
2012-05-19T00:56:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	okay and how did it break?  just doing an upgrade that got interrupted?
2012-05-19T00:58:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	what does it do when you boot
2012-05-19T00:59:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	so boot loader
2012-05-19T01:00:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	your boot screen
2012-05-19T01:01:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	so you can get into recovery mode?
2012-05-19T01:02:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	what option did you pick in recovery mode
2012-05-19T01:03:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	do you have that drop to root option?
2012-05-19T01:05:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	can you go in there?
2012-05-19T01:06:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	k do that, then try aptitude update; aptitude safe-upgrade
2012-05-19T01:07:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	yah, if youre running as root, you're inside the fs
2012-05-19T01:07:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	can you make sure
2012-05-19T01:08:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	oh okay
2012-05-19T01:09:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	yah, sorry, I dunno too much about rescuing Ubuntu systems.  You can boot off a live USB though and get your data off
2012-05-19T01:09:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	grub is just the bootloader ... it tells the computer what OS to boot into.  Depending on your options from there, you can get into the box, if the rescue options exist
2012-05-19T01:12:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	what do you mean
2012-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	beandog	Peri_	yah thats a rare problem you ran into
