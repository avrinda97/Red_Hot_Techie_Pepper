2008-09-25T09:14:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	using alsa not pulse audio. and the programme is closed
2008-09-25T09:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Well then you can restart ALSA, and actually, Pulse sits inside ALSA, so it may still make a difference.
2008-09-25T09:19:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	i dont see a restart pulseaudio command in that wiki mpage
2008-09-25T09:20:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	also according to my sound configuration in the preferences menu i dont even have pulseaudio installed
2008-09-25T09:21:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Are you not running Hardy?
2008-09-25T09:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	How odd.........
2008-09-25T09:24:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	probably wound up uninstalled when i tried to get it to work right with secondlife and it only just buggered my entire sound system. so i had to uninstall oit
2008-09-25T09:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Well, I'm not entirely sure what to suggest. Truth be told, Ibex is not that far away and Pulse has been causing us so much grief. I'm just begging people to wait patiently at this point :p
2008-09-25T09:26:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	ibex?
2008-09-25T09:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Intrepid Ibex, the next release...
2008-09-25T09:27:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	and in the meantime what was the grep command so i could manually kill the thing jamming my drivers
2008-09-25T09:28:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	oh yeah i had almost forgotten about the worry and woe of upgrading yet again and waiting to see how much of my system falls apart cause of it
2008-09-25T09:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	I truly don't know. I usually use ps -fu <username> to list processes and kill them by ID. As far as upgrading is concerned, I always do fresh installs as opposed to distro upgrades.
2008-09-25T09:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	I don't see the connection there......
2008-09-25T09:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Are you talking about in terms of backups? Not being able to back things up, you mean?
2008-09-25T09:31:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	someone once told me a command a ggrep combo  of some sort i used tohave to use it all the time before i got aclimated to linux would find what was using a specified driver or something
2008-09-25T09:32:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	well the easiest way for me to doa fresh install is to install to a third hard drive and since my home folder is on a seperate drive i can just relink everything up
2008-09-25T09:32:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	shuffle everything around until the current 1st ard drive is empty enough to just wipe clean
2008-09-25T09:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	a true, I see the logic there
2008-09-25T09:33:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	i got 2 250 gigs almost full to the brim i cant back everything on them up onto dvd's just like that ya know
2008-09-25T09:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Oh yeah, I get it.
2008-09-25T09:37:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	anyway your command worked. i found the offending programme but if i could remember the frigging grep combo it would make the task much easier
2008-09-25T09:39:00.000Z	bobertdos	Yowshi	Well, if you can remember the name of the process, then you can use killall to kill it much faster.
2008-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	Yowshi	bobertdos	yeah but i thought the process had already been ended. plus some of these programmes use obscure shortforms of the programmes name. and in the case of when my cdrom drivers jam up after burning the programme isnt running anymore just some process t started that didnt quit
