2008-08-29T11:16:00.000Z	bazhang	disting	if your modem does not work then you either need to get one that does, or find a way to make that one work; have you checked the model and make with linux in a search engine? ubuntuforums.org may have something as well.
2008-08-29T11:17:00.000Z	disting	bazhang	do u know any soft. that will help to run all window programs in linux?
2008-08-29T11:18:00.000Z	bazhang	disting	not all but wine does pretty well; additionally there are linux equivalents to most windows apps.
2008-08-29T11:18:00.000Z	disting	bazhang	hmm

2008-08-29T11:19:00.000Z	bazhang	disting	no that will not do it in terms of ram; you could try fluxbuntu if you wish
