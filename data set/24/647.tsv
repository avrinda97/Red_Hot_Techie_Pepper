2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		oh sorry I meant configuration and make tool?
2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		I have certain C codes

2011-04-17T11:16:00.000Z	bot_killer		yes I read about it in wikipedia... do you think that's good?
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		the wiki page was very critical about it
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		said it was old and did unnecesarry things
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	NightMonkey	bot_killer	Sounds like me.
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer	pfifo	what do you mean?
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		I have some basic C programs
2011-04-17T11:17:00.000Z	bot_killer		that use certain libraries like fftw
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		I'm writing my codes in C in ubuntu, and compiling it using g++ (gcc)
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		now I have a group of codes
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		(.C files)
2011-04-17T11:18:00.000Z	bot_killer		and .o files
2011-04-17T11:19:00.000Z	NightMonkey	bot_killer	Yah, lots of folks like cmake.
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		they are designed to work using pipelining. example -    input.dat | myfile | output.dat
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		myfile will process the input file, perform certain operations (like the fourier transform), and output it in output.dat
2011-04-17T11:20:00.000Z	bot_killer		ohk then cmake it is!
2011-04-17T11:21:00.000Z	bot_killer		I'll go with the kids :P
2011-04-17T11:22:00.000Z	bot_killer		thanks a lot pfifo NightMonkey
2011-04-17T11:22:00.000Z	NightMonkey	bot_killer	BTW, that criticism section on WP is pretty poorly sourced. Like everything, if you don't read the manual, things might break.
