2009-02-08T04:10:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	ha! cought you again xD! you left last time, i am having the same problem with grub
2009-02-08T04:11:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	ï»¿i am having trouble installing ubuntu 8.04 64 bit version. When the install reaches 80% it suddelny stops (after creating user). After that, if i restart the computer grub exists with error 15 so i can't load the installed ubuntu. I have 3 partitions, one for /, one for /opt and one for /home.
2009-02-08T04:12:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	if the installer doesn't finish, grub won't get installed... did you really wait long enough for the installer ? it downloads additonal language pack during install, which can be time consuming if you havn't lots of bandwidth
2009-02-08T04:13:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i tried running the installer in command line and it exists with no errors
2009-02-08T04:14:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i used the "ubiquity" command
2009-02-08T04:14:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	then it's hardware check time... memtest, cd self test...
2009-02-08T04:15:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	uf, can't we try install grub manually? i think that is the problem
2009-02-08T04:16:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	i doubt that.. if the installer quits you'll have a corrupt system anyway. not much use to fix grub just to find out yourn system doesn't work.
2009-02-08T04:16:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	and how do i do the tests?
2009-02-08T04:16:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	teh Live CD hs a selftest feature for the CD, and it has a memtest
2009-02-08T04:17:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	the live cd is ok i used that test
2009-02-08T04:17:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	ok, i'll try the memtest, however i doubt that this is the problem
2009-02-08T04:18:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	what can you tell about your hardware?
2009-02-08T04:18:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i don't really know what a good answer would be
2009-02-08T04:18:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	cpu? motherboard? ram?
2009-02-08T04:19:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i have a laptop with dualcore 2 duo T7500 at 2.2 ghz, and about 2gb ram
2009-02-08T04:20:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	make? model?
2009-02-08T04:20:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	asus motherboard
2009-02-08T04:21:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i have some saved that on the partition that i was going to mount in /home, could that interfere? it's from the ex 32 bit version
2009-02-08T04:21:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i had ubuntu running on 32 bit and now i wanted to go to 64
2009-02-08T04:22:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	not likely...  filesystem is filesystem... 64 or 32 bit
2009-02-08T04:23:00.000Z	stefg	cristi	but you could try to just run the installer without using more than a / (root) and swap. you can add the mounts for /home and other stuff later
2009-02-08T04:24:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	ok, i'll try that, thank you
2009-02-08T04:27:00.000Z	cristi	stefg	i have to go, thanks for the help
