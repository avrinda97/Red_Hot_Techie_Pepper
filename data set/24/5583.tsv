2006-06-21T07:32:00.000Z	sivanicon		so 4gb ram will = 2gb swap?
2006-06-21T07:33:00.000Z	josh	sivanicon	no... if you have 4 gig of ram you can just run with 500M, unless you suspend like triggr mentioned
2006-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	sivanicon	josh	well its goign to be an oracle server
2006-06-21T07:34:00.000Z	sivanicon	josh	and to tell you the truth i have no clue about disk suspend.
2006-06-21T07:35:00.000Z	josh		ok well then you wont be suspending so... 4 gig of ram with a 500 M swap should do you fine. unless you will have a super loaded server
2006-06-21T07:35:00.000Z	josh		what do you plan on using it for?
2006-06-21T07:37:00.000Z	sivanicon	josh	company is switching from windows oracle to linux oracle
