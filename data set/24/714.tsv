2011-11-12T11:19:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	You said "in Virtual terminal"
2011-11-12T11:21:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	I'm assuming you are running a VT other than native ssh.  Am I right?
2011-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 No, i mean to saay that when i go to alt+ctrl+f1 is show these type of message, perhabs u misunderstood my question
2011-11-12T11:23:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Guess so, you are actually talking terminal session, not virtual terminal, and you are getting errors.  From which package?
2011-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 i think it is because of Cheese
2011-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Cheese?????
2011-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 yes the webcam
2011-11-12T11:25:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 There are many bugs reported to it
2011-11-12T11:26:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Is there an alternate package to cheese?  I run Ubuntu and my WebCam went in seamlessly.  Let's see what is the package for that?
2011-11-12T11:27:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 Which application u use for your wecam??
2011-11-12T11:30:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Well just checked my system and not using my WebCam stand-alone, so went in with Skype.  I would try the packages that dr-willis suggested.
2011-11-12T11:31:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 video chat is working fine no issue ...Online issue is with cheese
2011-11-12T11:32:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	So no issues till you go online and then cheese craps on you?
2011-11-12T11:33:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 yes video chat with skype yahoo gmail etc working fine  but it is just  issue with cheese, i reported bugs for this and many of them
2011-11-12T11:33:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Which chat package are you using?
2011-11-12T11:34:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	I generally use gmail for video chat or skype
2011-11-12T11:34:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Does it work fine in Pidgin?
2011-11-12T11:34:00.000Z	jiltdil	TBotNik	 Not used pigdin yet
2011-11-12T11:37:00.000Z	TBotNik	jiltdil	Wasn't sure, so popped that Q to dr_willis, but Pidgin has lot's of good support so try it.  If they are forked off cheese then they probably got most of the bugs fixed.
