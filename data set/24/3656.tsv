2007-11-27T03:55:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	you can try the command "xev" it captures X events, so when pressing the Win key, you may see the name of the key or the way it responds to the X server.
2007-11-27T03:57:00.000Z	Rukus	vocx	key is not responding to that app
2007-11-27T03:58:00.000Z	Rukus	vocx	key is not responding to that xev
2007-11-27T03:58:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	all other keys work okay? And Win Key/Super doesn't? That is weird. Then get a new keyboard.
2007-11-27T04:05:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	use "dmesg" and see if it says something strange about your keyboard.  Did you upgrade the kernel recently?
2007-11-27T04:11:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	you would be surprised how people ask windows questions in here. Ha ha.
2007-11-27T04:12:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	I asked if you changed your kernel recently or some upgrade. Is it possible that a new driver for synaptics touchpad or something else has changed?
2007-11-27T04:12:00.000Z	Rukus	vocx	ya i was messing with the xorg.conf, i had to fix some settings in it recently., thats why i asked if it could be my xorg.conf earlier
2007-11-27T04:13:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	I think I wasn't here when you talked about xorg.conf so maybe repeating that part will help.
2007-11-27T04:15:00.000Z	Rukus	vocx	could it possible be the keyboard layout?
2007-11-27T04:16:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	102 is basic english I think and 105 has international symbols or something.
2007-11-27T04:20:00.000Z	Rukus	vocx	here is the keyboard section of my xorg.conf.  the only recently edited file that might affect the keyboard:     http://pastebin.com/m12e44c1e
2007-11-27T04:23:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	I have one more line. I don't remember the details but maybe it is added by reconfiguring the X Server. But you can add it manually too. http://pastebin.com/m4245dcd2
2007-11-27T04:27:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	I think that maybe a slow processor these days. I have a 3000+ but I really don't do anything CPU intensive.
2007-11-27T04:31:00.000Z	vocx	Rukus	please don't rant in here. It is considered trolling. I you wish to vent then go elsewhere. There is also #ubuntu-offtopic
