2008-06-18T14:41:00.000Z	veggteppey		hey, can someone tell me how to install Lua on ubuntu?
2008-06-18T14:42:00.000Z	veggteppey		ive been searching around but cant find it.
2008-06-18T14:43:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Tried searching for lua in Synaptic?
2008-06-18T14:49:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Thanks.
2008-06-18T14:50:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Starting with lua before you understand a terminal is probably slightly unwise.
2008-06-18T14:54:00.000Z	veggteppey	wgrant	can i try to start lua in terminal? if so, whats the cmd?^^
2008-06-18T14:54:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	lua
2008-06-18T15:01:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	You surely get a lua prompt as well? I do.
2008-06-18T15:02:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Correct.
2008-06-18T15:03:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	For what purpose? Python is always good.
2008-06-18T15:03:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	What programming is there for WoW?
2008-06-18T15:04:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	C++ isn't easy.
2008-06-18T15:05:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Python is nice and easy to get started with; a number of universities use it to teach first-year programming, and more are moving to it.
2008-06-18T15:39:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	What's wrong?
2008-06-18T15:39:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Oh, the YouTube bug. They're being nasty. Just go to any other Flash site, and it will ask you to install Flash.
2008-06-18T15:39:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Once you've been to another site and installed it, YouTube will work.
2008-06-18T15:40:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Alternatively, you can avoid Flash entirely. The built-in movie player can handle YouTube through a plugin.
2008-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	How can what do what?
2008-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Applications->Sound and Video->Movie Player.
2008-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	Then Edit->Plugins, and enable YouTube.
2008-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	wgrant	veggteppey	It's in the selection both with 'Playlist'
