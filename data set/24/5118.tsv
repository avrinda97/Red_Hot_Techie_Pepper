2008-09-07T04:07:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	gconf
2008-09-07T04:06:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	screenshot of your problem?
2008-09-07T04:07:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: so the settings of each addin to the panels can be found there?
2008-09-07T04:08:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	if you describe your problem better i can help you more
2008-09-07T04:09:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: the windows list addin to the lower panel is not wide enough, all the tabs are to small and doesn't fill out to the right as before
2008-09-07T04:10:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: I only see "..." in the boxes
2008-09-07T04:10:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	that sounds as if whatever is to the right of the window list is taking up the space
2008-09-07T04:10:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	what is the panel applet immediately to the right
2008-09-07T04:10:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: I have none to the right except the workspace addin
2008-09-07T04:11:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	they are called "applets" btw
2008-09-07T04:11:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: ok
2008-09-07T04:11:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	you see, there is no panel configuration for the width of an applet...
2008-09-07T04:12:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	try adding the Window List applet to the space and see what happens
2008-09-07T04:13:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: Now I have to list of the same , and both are small in size.
2008-09-07T04:14:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	can you add a new panel and try it?
2008-09-07T04:15:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	just context-click the space in a panel and choose New Panel
2008-09-07T04:16:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	: it might be something with the expand option..
2008-09-07T04:18:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	panel applets don't have an expand option
2008-09-07T04:18:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	- nope.. but the panel have
2008-09-07T04:18:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	so with an expanded panel, add the window list
2008-09-07T04:21:00.000Z	maxflax	alex-weej	I got it fixed... removing the panel and then adding it all again fixed it
2008-09-07T04:21:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	i've a feeling there was some applet on the panel that you couldn't see that was stealing space
2008-09-07T04:21:00.000Z	alex-weej	maxflax	but if recreating that panel has fixed it, sorted
