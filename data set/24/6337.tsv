2005-11-02T16:45:00.000Z	ptepper		you mean the mac address?
2005-11-02T16:47:00.000Z	ptepper		hey - I just installed ubuntu on a friends laptop and the installation quit while installing the ubuntu-desktop. Now when I try to install various pacakages I'm getting dependency errors like "Errors were encountered while processing: ubuntu-desktop"
2005-11-02T16:47:00.000Z	ptepper		anyone seen this kind of thing before?
2005-11-02T16:49:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	sounds like sources are not enabled
2005-11-02T16:49:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	you mean the repositories?
2005-11-02T16:49:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	if you could paste the errors in the pastebin it would be easier to diagnose
2005-11-02T16:50:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	then use the pastebin to show me your error messages....don't paste in main channel ;)
2005-11-02T16:50:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	I am thinking repositories aren't enabled yes
2005-11-02T16:56:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	ok ubotu should have sent you the links to the guides
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	k thanks, I'm gonna try that
2005-11-02T16:57:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	I suppose I should see the errors in the pastebin first hehe...I'm getting ahead of mysef
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	- I think ubuntu-desktop isn't installed correctly, so I'm going to update the sources and try installing it again...
2005-11-02T16:59:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	k
2005-11-02T17:06:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	- the repositories were there, tried to install ubuntu-desktop got an error
2005-11-02T17:06:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	paste the URL to pastebin in here
2005-11-02T17:08:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	I have NEVER seen that error before
2005-11-02T17:08:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	you got a tough problem
2005-11-02T17:08:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	yea, the hard drive made a repetitive sound, I have a feeling there might be bad block on the disk
2005-11-02T17:09:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	I'm not sure how to check for bad blocks though
2005-11-02T17:09:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	I think it's e2fsck - not surehow to make a boot disk to do that though
2005-11-02T17:10:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	you would need to run fsck I think, but you can't run it on a mounted drive
2005-11-02T17:10:00.000Z	ptepper	mustard5	right
2005-11-02T17:10:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	ask someone in here maybe
2005-11-02T17:11:00.000Z	mustard5	ptepper	ask if it can be done via LIVE CD
