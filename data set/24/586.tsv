2011-05-24T18:11:00.000Z	DevilSolution	ActionParsnip	yup
2011-05-24T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DevilSolution	is that equally bad?
2011-05-24T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DevilSolution	what apps / browsers have you tried?
2011-05-24T18:12:00.000Z	DevilSolution	ActionParsnip	just chrome but firefox always seems to crash my system
2011-05-24T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DevilSolution	can other users use the uploader ok?
2011-05-24T18:13:00.000Z	DevilSolution	ActionParsnip	what do you means apps? ive just tried the facebook built in loader both normal and simple
2011-05-24T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DevilSolution	i believe there are programs that can upload to the site. Not sure
2011-05-24T18:13:00.000Z	DevilSolution	ActionParsnip	im the only user on the pc
2011-05-24T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DevilSolution	sure but that doesn't stop you having multiple users. Make a fresh user then try the uploader
