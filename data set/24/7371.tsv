2005-04-23T10:20:00.000Z	Fazer		Hello, does anyone think that Haory is good choice for a laptop ? ( its 366 MHz with 160 MB ram)
2005-04-23T10:21:00.000Z	Fazer		Bah
2005-04-23T10:22:00.000Z	Fazer		xfce is newer than blackbox, right?
2005-04-23T10:23:00.000Z	Fazer		is Ndiswrapper available with Ubuntu?
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	yes, read the faq
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/ndiswrapper
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	no
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	oh?
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	how would that work?  the kernel loses all state between boots.
2005-04-26T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	you edit /boot/grub/menu.lst AFTER reading the comments in that file
2005-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	Hmm, because when I boot up the Live CD, I have to type in this in the boot parameters: "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi"
2005-04-26T09:02:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	how could editing /prc/cmdline ever work then, if it's booting off a read-only cd? ;)
2005-04-26T09:03:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	Ah yeah, i mean, when I have it installed.
2005-04-26T09:03:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	(note, you can't install off the livecd)
2005-04-26T09:03:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	So, when I install it, how do I make sure that these boot parameters: "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi" are there everytime I boot up the LiveCD.
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	er?  if you installed it, why are you using the livecd?
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	What do you mean by AFTER reading the comments?
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	Do I have to do that?
2005-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	of course, or you'll break it
2005-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	Can't I pass those command line parameters during the installation so they are there by default?
2005-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	I don't know
2005-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	Damn, okay.  Going back to the LiveCD now.
2005-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	Fazer	no
2005-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	Fazer	bob2	yes, i saw that coming.
