2006-06-04T16:32:00.000Z	patbam		anyone know how i can determine the specific pixel size of my monitor? (i'm tryinhg ot use 915resolution to handle a wide laptop screen)
2006-06-04T16:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	in Ubuntu 6.06?
2006-06-04T16:32:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	yeah (that's dapper, right? i just installed it.)
2006-06-04T16:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	you should just be able to install 915resolution in Synaptic, then reboot.
2006-06-04T16:33:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	ah ok, great, i'll give it a try. then i can tackle the lack of sound :)
2006-06-04T16:56:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	lee_: i think i'm in the exact same situation
2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	how improved?
2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	what model laptop?
2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	a vaio fs-620
2006-06-04T16:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	OK. Did 915resolution fix it completely?
2006-06-04T05:15:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	you'd have the latest.
2006-06-04T05:17:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	don't worry. You have the latest.
2006-06-04T05:18:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	ok, but i don't have sound
2006-06-04T05:18:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	what sound card?
2006-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	hmm... An odd Realtek chip.
2006-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	i found a meandering thread in the bug tracker but it didn't give any clear suggestions (or at least, any that i could make out)
2006-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	what bug number?
2006-06-04T05:21:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	  #28443:
2006-06-04T05:22:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	should i try to figure out how to install the cvs version of the alsa driver?
2006-06-04T05:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	that's a possibility.
2006-06-04T05:23:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	so how can i tell if the driver in question is in the kernel or a separate thing? (sorry, i'm a bit fuzzy on lower level kernelish things...)
2006-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	Fujitsu	patbam	I've got to go for a while.
2006-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	thanks for your help
2006-06-04T05:46:00.000Z	patbam	Fujitsu	vim++ :)
