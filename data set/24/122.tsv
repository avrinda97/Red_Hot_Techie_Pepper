2012-06-15T00:53:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	and if the number doesnt match then you need to re-download the iso.. highlu this isnt the case, but to be sure this is always a first step..
2012-06-15T00:42:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	i'm actually on a ubuntu usb.. so it does work from usb
2012-06-15T00:43:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	it doesnt work for me on that computer
2012-06-15T00:43:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	does the install load? or does the install install but you cant boot the "installed" ?
2012-06-15T00:45:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	i installed ubuntu 10.10 on it before, but now i can't get to the installation startup for 12.04 server, but it takes the installation cd for 10.10
2012-06-15T00:46:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	so no, it doesnt load installer
2012-06-15T00:46:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	the 12.04 installer does not boot for both as a usbinstaller or cdinstaller ?
2012-06-15T00:47:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	nope
2012-06-15T00:47:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	did you md5 checksum the iso?
2012-06-15T00:48:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	no
2012-06-15T00:50:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	never done that before
2012-06-15T00:50:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/
2012-06-15T00:51:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	(this too https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM)
2012-06-15T00:51:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	a unique math number is made from any file.. this number has to match the reported checksum from MD5SUMS
2012-06-15T00:57:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	the md5sum matched the one on the site
2012-06-15T00:58:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	that's good
2012-06-15T00:58:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	so its either the install media or something else..
2012-06-15T00:59:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	did you try  boot options with the installer?
2012-06-15T00:59:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	how do you mean?
2012-06-15T01:04:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	try acpi=off or nomodeset--  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
2012-06-15T01:07:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	how do i edit the grub file manually then, since it just starts the OS everytime instead of the other two that should start first?
2012-06-15T01:17:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	where can i find the grub.cfg file in the iso then? cause its not in /boot/grub/
2012-06-15T01:18:00.000Z	jagginess	Bronylicious	you edit grub rules in /etc/default and /etc/grubxxxx/   .. then do update-grub2  -- this updates grub.cfg somewhere in /boot ... the grub1-2 stage loader looks for grub.cfg .. -- don't edit grub.cfg directly because you'll lose changes when you update kernel packages
2012-06-15T01:27:00.000Z	Bronylicious	jagginess	where in the grub file do i put acpi=off ? cause i see that all of them have a GRUB_ prefix, so i am a bit confused now
