2008-07-13T04:31:00.000Z	Derander		Hey, I'm trying to uninstall Courier (IMAP), but accidentally deleted /etc/courier.  Now whenever I run apt-get remove courier-imap, I get errors from dpkg about a missing config file.  Is there a way I can let aptitude know that the package is gone?

2008-07-13T04:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Derander	edit /etc/init.d/courier-imap. Make the second line read: exit 0
2008-07-13T04:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Derander	then after removing, install it and remove it again
2008-07-13T04:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Derander	yeah
2008-07-13T04:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Derander	looks like you deleted lots of configfiles manually. remove all packages related to dovecot, mysql and courier and try again
