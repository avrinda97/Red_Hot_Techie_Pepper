2007-10-24T17:43:00.000Z	ndee		how can I generate the md5sum of a normal input? Somehow, I just don't get it. I tried md5sum foobar
2007-10-24T17:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	you want the md5sum of stdin?
2007-10-24T17:43:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	yep
2007-10-24T17:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	just don't specify a file
2007-10-24T17:44:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	ok, but then I enter something, when does md5sum know when the input is finished?
2007-10-24T17:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	ctrl+d
2007-10-24T17:45:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	cool, txh
2007-10-24T17:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	ctrl+d = EOF
2007-10-24T17:46:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	ok but I have to use a "Return" at the end of the line, otherwise, it doesn't stop
2007-10-24T17:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	you only need ctrl+d
2007-10-24T17:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	oh actually you're right, it does seem to want a return
2007-10-24T17:47:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	I enter md5sum, then enter a text, then press ctrl-d but it doesn't output it.
2007-10-24T17:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	so just press enter
2007-10-24T17:48:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	but doesn't that add some additional chars?
2007-10-24T17:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	no
2007-10-24T17:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	you can test it by making a file containing some text and then manually typing it in, it will be the same
2007-10-24T17:49:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	what does "test" give you? then try the one with an enter.
2007-10-24T17:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	d8e8fca2dc0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249
2007-10-24T17:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	both were the same
2007-10-24T17:50:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	http://petrus.homeftp.org/scripting/utilities/md5/md5.php <-- here it gives me a different value.
2007-10-24T17:50:00.000Z	ndee	dystopianray	it is not the same.
2007-10-24T17:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	it is
2007-10-24T17:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	you are doing it wrong if it is not the same
2007-10-24T17:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	ndee	do it like this: cat | md5sum
