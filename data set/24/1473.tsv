2009-12-30T01:26:00.000Z	dangermind		Hi, i have a problem with my ubuntu server dns, i have internal connectivity but not external connectivity, when i ping to www.google.com i get: uknown host www.google.com
2009-12-30T01:26:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	What if you change the DNS of the machine you're pinging from?
2009-12-30T01:28:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	i get the same
2009-12-30T01:28:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	SOunds like a firewall issue.
2009-12-30T01:29:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	i have installed webmin and in the net configuration all is good, and i have the firewall disabled
2009-12-30T01:31:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Just curious.... How are you getting here without DNS?
2009-12-30T01:32:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	im in other pc
2009-12-30T01:32:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	and i connect to the server via ssh
2009-12-30T01:33:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Ok.  so it's just the server that can't resolve.
2009-12-30T01:34:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	yes
2009-12-30T01:34:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Can the server ping by IP?
2009-12-30T01:35:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	when i ping to an ip i get: network is unreachable
2009-12-30T01:35:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Hmm.
2009-12-30T01:35:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Is the gateway set correctly?
2009-12-30T01:37:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	i think the gateway is set correctly, its 192.168.1.1, that is the router address, and i dont understand the 2ยบ question
2009-12-30T01:38:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	that should be correct.  How about the subnet mask?
2009-12-30T01:39:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	255.255.255.0
2009-12-30T01:39:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Wow. everything sounds fine.  maybe a router setting denying access? Try changing the IP of the server and see if that fixes it.
2009-12-30T01:40:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	i think all about the network configuration its ok because i have internal connectivity, and i can connect from other pcs to the files throw the samba server installed
2009-12-30T01:41:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	how do i do that?
2009-12-30T01:42:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	Over ssh? Hrm...
2009-12-30T01:43:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	yes, and via web, by the webmin. https://192.168.1.36:10000
2009-12-30T01:44:00.000Z	canthus13	dangermind	I suppose you could do it more easily via webmin. you'd just have to reconnect to it at the new IP after confirming the change.
2009-12-30T01:51:00.000Z	dangermind	canthus13	i do not know how to caching the ip
