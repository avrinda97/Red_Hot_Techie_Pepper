2011-06-29T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	drop it - it all stops now,
2011-06-29T18:32:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	"Please"?
2011-06-29T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	it doesn't help to fuel it - it stops now
2011-06-29T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	when you said i3 earlier did you mean the intel i3 chip, or the mac generation 3 PPC ?
2011-06-29T18:35:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	Intel i3, sorry.
2011-06-29T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	is it the model with the ATI card ? (I suspect it's the old ati bug)
2011-06-29T18:36:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	I think it's 32-bit, but both the 32- and 64-bit LiveCDs do the same thing.
2011-06-29T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	no, I mean what model video card is it, I suspect it's an ATI
2011-06-29T18:36:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	Hmm... Possibly. I'm not actually sure. Its OS was royally buggered, so I've got no ieda what's in it beyond the processor.
2011-06-29T18:36:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	Yes, I was in the middle of typing that when you responded. ;)
2011-06-29T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	what size is it, 15'' or 17''
2011-06-29T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	let me see if I can find the models with the ati's
2011-06-29T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	it's worth trying to install it from the alternative CD which doesn't use a full on desktop gui for the intstaller
2011-06-29T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	it's easier to fix on an intalled system, than a livecd
2011-06-29T18:38:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	I can imagine...
2011-06-29T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	is it possible to try installing with the alternative cd ?
2011-06-29T18:42:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	If I add radeon.modeset=0 nomodeset to the default boot options, it works.
2011-06-29T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	that ties in with the ati bug
2011-06-29T18:43:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	Yeah, so it is a horrible mutant machine after all.
2011-06-29T18:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	easy to fix post install, so hang in
2011-06-29T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Syniq	the higherend ones come with ati
2011-06-29T18:44:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	Lies.
2011-06-29T19:49:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	I think LjL should just +b *!*@92.96.193.32. >.<
2011-06-29T21:44:00.000Z	Syniq	ikonia	It is with a slight sense of irony that I note most anyone whose nickname contains the word 'cool' is almost certainly the antithesis of the word.
