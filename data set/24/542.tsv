2011-11-12T05:53:00.000Z	benzap		i'm under the impression it has something to do with screen, but i'm not sure

2011-11-12T05:58:00.000Z	benzap	L1nuxRules	tail on /var/log/messages shows nothing fishy
2011-11-12T05:59:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	benzap	is port 22 open ? are you the admin? has anyone done work on the server for you?
2011-11-12T06:00:00.000Z	benzap	L1nuxRules	port 22 is open, it's on a router
