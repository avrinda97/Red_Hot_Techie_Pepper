2006-10-24T07:57:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	well, I COULD... if X would even START... which it isn't
2006-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	it's a version mismatch between the nvidia kernel module and X module
2006-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	yes
2006-10-24T08:00:00.000Z	Mastastealth	Chippy	are you using Edgy though>
2006-10-24T08:00:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	nope
2006-10-24T08:03:00.000Z	Mastastealth	Chippy	have you tried uninstalling the drivers via the script (sudo ./nvidia-installer --uninstall) and then removing any apt-get drivers (apt-get remove nvidia*)
2006-10-24T08:04:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	I did the uninstall, but not the remove nvidia
2006-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	I'm guessing I should?
2006-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	what packages did you mean then? nvidia*?

2006-10-24T08:07:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	done
2006-10-24T08:07:00.000Z	Chippy	Mastastealth	now what should I install to get nvidia running?
