2007-11-04T18:21:00.000Z	f00bar80		after installation
2007-11-04T18:22:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	what did you install?
2007-11-04T18:22:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	ubuntu 7
2007-11-04T18:22:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	using the alternate cd or what?
2007-11-04T18:22:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	or server cd?
2007-11-04T18:23:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	server edition
2007-11-04T18:24:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-11-04T18:24:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	that will install the entire graphic environment as if you Installed from the desktop cd
2007-11-04T18:24:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	after installation
2007-11-04T18:24:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	yes, type  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-11-04T18:26:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	the server edition doesn't have graphical env.
2007-11-04T18:26:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	 you can install the graphical environment by typing sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop!!
2007-11-04T18:27:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	but the server edition doesn't have neithr install graphical env by default ?
2007-11-04T18:27:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	no, that's the whole point of the server edition
2007-11-04T18:27:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	what do u mean by the whole point
2007-11-04T18:28:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	the point of using the server edition instead of desktop edition is when you don't want a graphical environment
2007-11-04T18:28:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	the only difference between server and desktop is the default installed set of packages...
2007-11-04T18:29:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	which are
2007-11-04T18:29:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	can i use this server edition to install a vitual box
2007-11-04T18:30:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	virtual*
2007-11-04T18:30:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	the server install doesnt include the graphical environment, and uses a differently optimized kernel by default. that's the only differences.
2007-11-04T18:31:00.000Z	f00bar80	jonasj	so i can't use something that does virtual enviroment ?
2007-11-04T18:33:00.000Z	jonasj	f00bar80	i don't know much about virtual environments, but if you want a graphical env, just install it, otherwise dont, whats the problem?
