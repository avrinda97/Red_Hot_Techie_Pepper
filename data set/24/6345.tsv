2007-12-22T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	type /topic
2007-12-22T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	 not a matter of linux. the topic of *this channel* says: Flash plugin installation is currently broken. This is due to adobe changing the tar file that the package downloads.
2007-12-22T06:17:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	yes, if you can wait that would be best
2007-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	you can convert them, but it's usually a terribly bad idea.
2007-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	first RPM packages, then "installers"... you're trying to break your system immediately, aren't you?
2007-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	you're not supposed to talk back to your terminal, you know :)
2007-12-22T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	anyway, yes, it's the exclamation mark
2007-12-22T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	well if you just started yesterday, then be careful about installing things and such. ask here first. as a general rule, you should ONLY install packages from the repositories, and ONLY install stuff that isn't in there if you REALLY know what you're doing
2007-12-22T06:31:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	emus?
2007-12-22T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	there are NES and SNES emulators for Ubuntu too.
2007-12-22T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	wtf what?
2007-12-22T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	i made Ubotu send you a private message
2007-12-22T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	i'll make it send you some more about (S)NES emulators
2007-12-22T06:36:00.000Z	LjL	Ubuntnoob	as you can see, there is a low of choice with (S)NES emulators
