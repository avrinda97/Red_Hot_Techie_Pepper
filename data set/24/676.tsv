2011-04-05T02:02:00.000Z	skomorokh		Any idea how to install firefox 3.6 at the same time as the firefox 4 from the firefox-stable ppa? I would just put the tarball in /opt but unfortunately there is no binary tarball for 64bit arch on account of moz being weird
2011-04-05T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	the daily ppa installs firefox 4 as a seperate app, don't run upgrade though or it will make your 3.5 to the daily build too
2011-04-05T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	remove the ppa after you install so your upgrades don't get pulled down
2011-04-05T02:05:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	I want to upgrade it when new versions are released. That is exactly the problem---firefox-4.0 becomes firefox. Which would be fine, I just apt-get install firefox-3.6 ... except firefox-3.6 is actually some weird alias for firefox-4.0 instead of an actual package.
2011-04-05T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	the daily will give you 2 binaries so you can run either
2011-04-05T02:05:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	I use firefox 4 as my primary browser and want updates for it. I'm just looking for a 64 bit ff3 package.
2011-04-05T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	as far as i know, the ppa has both arches
2011-04-05T02:07:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Yes, the packages are in 64bit. But they're all called firefox so I can't install both at the same time.
2011-04-05T02:08:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	The arch comment was regarding Mozilla only offering binary tarballs in 32bit.
2011-04-05T02:08:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Otheriwse I'd just untar it in /opt.
2011-04-05T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	the daily build has 64bit builds and will give you a firefox-4.0 which will run version 4, firefox will run 3.6
2011-04-05T02:09:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Ya, but those are daily builds.  I just want stable 4.0 and 3.6 :)
2011-04-05T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	thats al I can advise
2011-04-05T02:09:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Ah well, thanks for trying.
2011-04-05T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	the daily build is pretty good
2011-04-05T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	or you could compile and make a deb ;)
2011-04-05T02:13:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Daily builds or compiling from scratch? Wonderful options.
2011-04-05T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	well the compiled debs aren't to your taste so what else can you do.
2011-04-05T02:15:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	Both mozilla and ubuntu are so silly about this... Usually I could just extract the binary or install two packages and use /etc/alternatives but mozilla killed the first one and the ubuntu packagers the second.
2011-04-05T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	its one of the disadvantages of packaged systems
2011-11-10T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	^
2011-11-10T23:24:00.000Z	skomorokh	ActionParsnip	I saw that... but that's about Ubuntu and not the PPAs, or is this mozillateam saying that they will no longer package xulrunner in any form?
2011-11-10T23:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	not sure, I don't listen to mozilla stuff any more
2011-11-10T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skomorokh	the guys in #mozilla may be able to advise
