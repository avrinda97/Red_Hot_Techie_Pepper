2006-06-06T05:40:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	it will prompt you for a password, do NOT give it your login password
2006-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	nope, lemme see your /etc/samba/smb.conf in pastebin please
2006-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	wubrgamer	DBO	why not my login password ?
2006-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	wubrgamer	DBO	it was a bit late.......can i just change it ?
2006-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	if you want, its a minor security thing
2006-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	just do "smbpasswd" in terminal to change it
2006-06-06T05:44:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	as for not being able to see your shares, I need to see your /etc/samba/smb.conf
2006-06-06T05:45:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	its encrypted, it just gets sent over the network, its up to you man
2006-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	DBO	wubrgamer	no swearing please
