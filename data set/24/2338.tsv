2009-06-13T08:04:00.000Z	linux		whats the name of that offtopic fubar grill channel here
2009-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	#ubuntu-offtopic
2009-08-28T05:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	lsb_release -a
2009-08-28T05:22:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	already checked there
2009-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	what about https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades ?
2009-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	the package to upgrade couldn't be installed because of broken packages
2009-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	i just installed ubuntu-server 6.06 today and have no other packages on it
2009-08-28T05:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	dist-upgrade only updates the packages to the most version for that release
2009-08-28T05:25:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	update-manager-core won't install b/c of broken packages, i have no CD drive and motherboard doesn't support USB boot
2009-08-28T05:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	what packages are broken?
2009-08-28T05:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	what happens when you use sudo apt-get install python-gnupginterface?
2009-08-28T05:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	try sudo apt-get install python2.4-gnupginterface?
2009-08-28T05:28:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	couldn't find package
2009-08-28T05:29:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	maybe i'll track down the *.deb and manual install that one
2009-08-28T05:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	try gnupginterface instead of python-gnupginterface
2009-08-28T05:29:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	no package found for that either
2009-08-28T05:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	then I'm out of ideas
2009-08-28T05:30:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	thanks, i'll try to install manually or add sources.list to restricted URLs
2009-08-28T05:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	it might be in universe
2009-08-28T05:33:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	that fixed the problem: allowing restricted URLs to be uncommented in the sources.list
2009-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	you will first need to upgrade to 8.10
2009-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	thanks again, any command that will do that in terminal?
2009-08-28T08:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	linux	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IntrepidUpgrades#Network%20Upgrade%20for%20Ubuntu%20Servers%20%28Recommended%29
2009-08-28T08:31:00.000Z	linux	lstarnes	will do
