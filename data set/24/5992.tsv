2006-03-05T12:15:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	haha, i hear ya, what'd you have problems with?
2006-03-05T12:16:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	ndiswrapper, wrong drivers for the wifi (not ubuntu's fault), acpi hell
2006-03-05T12:16:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	goodluck with all that.... my main issue has been with firefox
2006-03-05T12:17:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	mostly wifi/laptop stuff
2006-03-05T12:17:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	yeah, you have to use non-free version of flash for it to work right with a lot of sites.
2006-03-05T12:18:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	even in 64?
2006-03-05T12:18:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	yeah, no flash on my 64bit lappy yet :(
2006-03-05T12:19:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	yeah, i just installed the 32 bit firefox and am running 32 bit JRE and Flash with that
2006-03-05T12:19:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	breezy i368 installed pretty easy... but dapper and breezy 64 both were frustrating!
2006-03-05T12:20:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	lol.... im still piecing mine together
2006-03-05T12:21:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	yeah, I had to add a repos from some dude to get enlightenment, and eterm working...
2006-03-05T12:22:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	oh hells yeah... gots to have my E!
2006-03-05T12:23:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	have you figured out how to get yout booot time down? mine takes 2+ minutes with an athlon 64 x2 3800 w/ a gb of ram and a SATA II
2006-03-05T12:23:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	who 2 minutes! somethings wrong, check your logs/dmesg!
2006-03-05T12:24:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	well, im loading crazy stuff like bluetooth and i have no idea how to turn it off
2006-03-05T12:24:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	its probably sitting at boot waiting for something (like the network that never comes up...) you can hit ctrl-c to skip, and move on...
2006-03-05T12:26:00.000Z	theskunk	bit_seqz	im spoiled by slackware/gentoo where i edit my own scripts
2006-03-05T12:27:00.000Z	bit_seqz	theskunk	yeah.. me too... ive been using ubuntu a lot for about 3 months now...
