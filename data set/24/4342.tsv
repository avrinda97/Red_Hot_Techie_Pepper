2007-05-12T11:48:00.000Z	tim167		cholera : Kino and avidemux have worked fine for me
2007-05-12T11:48:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	I could never get avidemux to open a raw dv file
2007-05-12T11:49:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	first encode the dv file to avi using kino
2007-05-12T11:50:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	the problem is more complicated, I can capture and render video fine for my linux box, when I try to put the videos on my site, my family is unable to play the files, I even gave them downloads to vlc and a couple of codecs. I would like to convert the files without doing that
2007-05-12T11:52:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	for codecs, i found mjpeg for video and pcm for audio to be the most effective, i don't know FMP4 tho...
2007-05-12T11:53:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	Mencoder MPEG-4 (FMP4)
2007-05-12T11:54:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	capture dv files with kino, encode a a single avi file, then I can use mencoder for further compression or conversion of audio and video?
2007-05-12T11:56:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	how i do it: import from dv camera with kino, do some basic editing, export from kino as avi (mjpeg/pcm) and then straight into Devede, done. limited but it works for me
2007-05-12T11:58:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	okay, sounds good, I'll give it a shot, thanks
2007-05-12T11:58:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	good luck
2007-05-12T11:59:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	I'm one click away from throwing my box out the window :)
2007-05-12T11:59:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	hang in there :)
2007-05-12T12:05:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	actually, I don't export mjpeg from kino, but i use XviD MPEG4-AVI Dual Pass (in the 'other' tab ) the mjpeg thing was in avidemux i think...
2007-05-12T12:10:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	i had tired the Xvid MPEG4-AVI Dual Pass, since I was puttng the file on my site, family members needed to install a codec to play the file. I supplied them with the download but apparently that was too confusing for my parents. :)
2007-05-12T12:11:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	they are all windows users
2007-05-12T12:12:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	i put videos online using a java plugin, most people have it, and it allows you to use ogg, ...a free and open format :)
2007-05-12T12:13:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	I still new, I was under the impression that ogg was for audio, I'll take a look at yet another option, thanks
2007-05-12T12:13:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	you can export as ogg theora from avidemux
2007-05-12T12:14:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	this will play in wmp? or should I convice my parents to install vlc
2007-05-12T12:15:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	they should definitely install vlc if you ask me...
2007-05-12T12:15:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	but to play a video on a website with this java ogg plugin you dont need vlc
2007-05-12T12:16:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	okay, I put a link on my site for them to install vlc, and Ubuntu also :) we'll see what happens
2007-05-12T12:16:00.000Z	tim167	cholera	good, it doesnt hurt to try ;)
2007-05-12T12:17:00.000Z	cholera	tim167	I think I would like to go with something universal, java sounds like a productive option, if you still around I'll post back with the results, thanks again
