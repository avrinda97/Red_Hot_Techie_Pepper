2006-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	shwag		anyone used Serpentine, the gnome CD burner ?
2006-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	i've used GnomeBaker, the GNOME CD burner
2006-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	yah...i was trying to get the one working that is included with gnome. Im just trying to burn an audio cd.
2006-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	it loads and appears to work, but when I click Burn To Cd,..nothing happens.
2006-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	maybe cdrecord isn't detecting your burner?
2006-11-12T15:03:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	how can I check ?
2006-11-12T15:03:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	cdrecord -scanbus
2006-11-12T15:04:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	permission denied. very very interesting.
2006-11-12T15:04:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	you might not be in the appropriate group
2006-11-12T15:05:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	hm....in /etc/group   my user is in the cdrom group
2006-11-12T15:07:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	cdrecord thinks in scsi. that's correct. reconfigure cdrecord suid
2006-11-12T15:08:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	well...isnt that what the  cdrom  group is for ?
2006-11-12T15:11:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	AWOSLappy: /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd are both in the cdrom group, and I have two cdroms...one is a burner.  /dev/sg0
2006-11-12T15:11:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	why are you using SCSI emulation?
2006-11-12T15:12:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	im not...except I have a USB hd plugged in.
2006-11-12T15:12:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	ah, ok
2006-11-12T15:13:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	guess I should file a bug.
2006-11-12T15:13:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	read the cdrecord manpage and search for suid. there's no bug
2006-11-12T15:13:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	how do I..not use scsi emulation with cdrecord?
2006-11-12T15:16:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	there is a bug as far as ubuntu being able to automatically be able to burn cd's without it breaking if a user plugs in a USB hd.
2006-11-12T15:16:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	but i should figure out the solution first.
2006-11-12T15:16:00.000Z	shwag	neildarlow	this isnt a suid issue.
2006-11-12T15:17:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	ok
2006-11-12T15:18:00.000Z	neildarlow	shwag	sgN used to be SCSI generic devices
