2005-09-30T10:43:00.000Z	Megz		Why should I use ubuntu instead of Fedora?
2005-09-30T10:44:00.000Z	Chii_Chan	Megz	I believe its a personal preference
2005-09-30T10:44:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		Use whatever suits you, or so seems to be the spirit of linux
2005-09-30T10:44:00.000Z	Megz		Ok well you guys all told me it's crap, but I'm wondering what the reason is
2005-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	Megz		WHY is ubuntu better
2005-09-30T10:45:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		I dont know if it is crap or not.... Ive been using linux for three days now and Ive started with Ubuntu
2005-09-30T10:47:00.000Z	Megz		is Ubuntu ever going to have Composite turned on with X?
2005-09-30T10:47:00.000Z	Megz		Xorg
2005-09-30T10:47:00.000Z	Megz		the slowness of Xwindows gui is the biggest thing holding me back from Linux.. windows is just too much faster to really take linux serious right now
2005-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		Then go with windows megz
2005-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		Its supposed to be whatever suits you best
2005-09-30T10:48:00.000Z	Megz	Seveas	You can't even drag a window around in X, without seeing it flicker.
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Megz		And.. you can watch everything update in X
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Megz		you can see your dialog boxes redraw.
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Megz		on any PC, no matter how fast
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Megz	Seveas	Try dragging a window around.
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		I think that is just a visual thing similar to cursor trails
2005-09-30T10:49:00.000Z	Megz		its like windows 3.1
2005-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		I have xp and ubuntu on here and I dont believe that it load slower on here
2005-09-30T10:50:00.000Z	Megz		well I setup two identical boxes, the linux boxes took like 4x longer to start up applications
2005-09-30T10:51:00.000Z	Chii_Chan		Im also running on a 3ghz laptop with 1024 mb ram with a radeon igp450m
2005-09-30T10:51:00.000Z	Megz		linux gui is in general pretty slow
2005-09-30T10:51:00.000Z	Megz		Well, once Xorg supports composite properly, that slowness will be "swept under the rug."
2005-09-30T10:52:00.000Z	Chii_Chan	Megz	according to the definition I have read about trolls.  You are seeming to match it o.O  Once who comes into one area to argue something and backs everything said by facts in order to cause unrest
