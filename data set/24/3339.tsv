2008-09-03T00:54:00.000Z	BlueKoala		Can anyone help me with a wireless device?
2008-09-03T00:55:00.000Z	BlueKoala		It's a Cisco wireless adaptor inside a thinkpad t40
2008-09-03T00:55:00.000Z	BlueKoala		I need to figure out how to restart the device so I can run a script file wheneverr the network connection disappears
2008-09-03T00:55:00.000Z	BlueKoala		I thought it was a problem with nm-applet but unfortunately the problem lies on a lower level
2008-09-03T00:56:00.000Z	BlueKoala		The device works
2008-09-03T00:56:00.000Z	BlueKoala		It connects to a network upon boot about 40% of the time
2008-09-03T00:57:00.000Z	BlueKoala		Does anyone know how I can re-initialize my eth1 device?
2008-09-03T00:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	ifup and ifdown, right?
2008-09-03T00:58:00.000Z	BlueKoala		AIRONET Wireless communications Cisco Aironet Wireless 802.11b
2008-09-03T00:59:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	I'm not familliar with ifup and ifdown
2008-09-03T01:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	well, the man pages for those are pretty straight forward.  Can you please take a look?  I can help you further if you need it
2008-09-03T01:01:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	Can you give me some insight on where I can find the man pages for those? I would be happy to do all the research if I knew where to find the relevant information.
2008-09-03T01:01:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	I'm really green to the whole unix type scene
2008-09-03T01:01:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	are you familiar with the CLI?  or sometimes called a terminal?
2008-09-03T01:02:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	why are you trying to reset your eth1 device?
2008-09-03T01:02:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	I've used the terminal before and right now am urunning nm-applet via terminal session so I can monitor what happens with it when I try to connect to wireless networtks
2008-09-03T01:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	well, on a terminal run: man ifup
2008-09-03T01:03:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	Because it does not seem to be working properly most of the time. I want to write a script to fix it whenever it's not working.
2008-09-03T01:03:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	Thank you, I was unaware of that "command".
2008-09-03T01:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	in general, you can type: man <command>       for any cli command to get some indepth documentation for that command
2008-09-03T01:08:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	Is there a command that will list all the available commands? I really feel like this could help me progress a lot in this environment.
2008-09-03T01:09:00.000Z	danbhfive		!cli
2008-09-03T01:09:00.000Z	danbhfive	BlueKoala	hit tab twice, and then get blown away.   That page is a better place to start
2008-09-03T01:10:00.000Z	BlueKoala	danbhfive	1956 possibilities. Blown away is an understatement =]
