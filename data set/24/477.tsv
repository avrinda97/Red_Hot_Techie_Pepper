2011-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	Braber01		I'm trying to boot from usb and I'm getting a message that says NTLDR is missing how can I fix this?
2011-10-16T20:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	how did you load the iso to the usb?
2011-10-16T20:40:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	I moved it from where it was saved was that the wrong way to do it?
2011-10-16T21:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	check the bots answer to nomodeset
2011-10-16T21:10:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	I'm trying to restore my GRUB so I don't know what to do.
2011-10-16T21:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	okay the usb you have loaded is just giving a black screen correct?
2011-10-16T21:11:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	yes that's correct
2011-10-16T21:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	when you boot the usb tap the shift key repeatedly to see if you get the try, install, check memory...etc gui if you do hit f6 click nomodeset and boot in.
2011-10-16T21:14:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	that's not working what else should i try?
2011-10-16T21:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	that is a low boot attempt, how did hyou load the ISO, and have you checked the md5sum on the ISO?
2011-10-16T21:15:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	I used the usb installer, and I'm not sure how to checkthe md5sum if I can't load Linux or Windows
2011-10-16T21:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	what computer and OS are you using to load the usb, you would check the md5sum there
2011-10-16T21:17:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	I'm using a Gateway NV55C, however I can't access any of my OS's
2011-10-16T21:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	not sure then the toolkit needs to have full use. having basic tools missing is a mistake, like a OS to do tests
2011-10-16T21:19:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	All I'm trying to do is get my grub back
2011-10-16T21:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	sure, but without a bootable cd or usb, you seem to be dead in te water, look up manuoa booting on the web, and ubuntu dforums.
2011-10-16T21:21:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	would ubuntu 9.10 work?
2011-10-16T21:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	sure but you will have to chroot in to do it, you want a lionk for that?
2011-10-16T21:23:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	yes please
2011-10-16T21:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	cool hope you getter done. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2011-10-16T22:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	the chroot right?
2011-10-16T22:31:00.000Z	Braber01	urlin2u	yes that's right
2011-10-16T22:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	the first command is sudo fdisk -l ths tells you where the ubun tu partition is follow the instructions, your only mounting it and install grub to the mbr, not a partition, unless you have purged grub from the partition.
2011-10-16T22:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	Braber01	hope that post made sense, your only installing grub to the mbr which is sdX, unless the ubuntu is missing the grub files put there on install.
