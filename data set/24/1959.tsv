2009-06-12T11:49:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	yes
2009-06-12T11:50:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	good, i have a problem with it. when i want to shut the computer down, it does it normally till the ubuntu-logo is gone.... then there is only a black screen, but it doesn't do anything... do u know why this could be?
2009-06-12T11:52:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	the computer doesnt power off?
2009-06-12T11:52:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	nope
2009-06-12T11:54:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	what vs of ubuntu are you using?
2009-06-12T11:54:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	jaunty64
2009-06-12T11:56:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	sounds like an acpi problem.
2009-06-12T11:57:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	and how can i solve it?
2009-06-12T11:57:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	cmdline: gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-06-12T11:58:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	can you post the line you use to boot, for me it is: kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic root=UUID=3519805c-6c92-4a33-b2bc-eb6b5ba195f2 ro quiet splash
2009-06-12T12:00:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	hm.... can't find the line....
2009-06-12T12:01:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	without boot the line is here.... but not with it
2009-06-12T12:01:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	just the kernel line
2009-06-12T12:02:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	i shall post just the kernel line?
2009-06-12T12:02:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	yes need to see if you have any special boot paramaters, like noacpi etc
2009-06-12T12:02:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	here it is: kernel  /vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic root=UUID=db9858d9-5a11-4049-bc65-2952f6843575 ro quiet splash
2009-06-12T12:04:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	seems to be this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usplash/+bug/326988
2009-06-12T12:05:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	 seems disabling splash resolves the problem
2009-06-12T12:05:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	which means, remove splash from the kernel line in menu.lst
2009-06-12T12:06:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	only "splash" or "quiet splash" ?
2009-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	darkest_night	richj	wohoo, thx, now it works :)
2009-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	richj	darkest_night	glad i could help :)
