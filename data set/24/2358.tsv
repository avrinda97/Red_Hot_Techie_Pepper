2009-03-07T21:27:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	if you give it the right options (such as --mirror), yes, of course
2009-03-07T21:28:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	ok
2009-03-07T21:28:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	you do realize that downloading the entire ubuntu repositories will be huge?
2009-03-07T21:28:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	oCean_ isnt there rsync kind of thing
2009-03-07T21:28:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	no idea about rsync
2009-03-07T21:29:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	give me name of any mirror
2009-03-07T21:29:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	http://archive.ubuntu.com
2009-03-07T21:29:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	you may probably want to use the mirror closest to your country, though
2009-03-07T21:30:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	ya
2009-03-07T21:30:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	i am in india

2009-03-07T21:30:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	cool
2009-03-07T21:32:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	you're looking at about a 25Gb download.
2009-03-07T21:32:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	ok
2009-03-07T21:34:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	rsync works hurray
2009-03-07T21:35:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	 rsync in.archive.ubuntu.com::ubuntu   this is the way to do
2009-03-07T21:36:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	what, exactly - something like rsync -a in.archive.ubuntu.com::ubuntu ./ ?
2009-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	ya
2009-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	 rsync -av in.archive.ubuntu.com::ubuntu   ./
2009-03-07T21:37:00.000Z	LjL	roshan08	even better would be something allowing you to do load balancing between servers, but i can't think of anything
2009-03-07T21:38:00.000Z	roshan08	LjL	ya i cant do anything
