2007-09-05T08:40:00.000Z	hendrixski		hey, does anybody know of a plugin to a mail client that allows you to view .odt documents in it, without having to download and open them in OOo?
2007-09-05T08:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	there is no such a thing afaik
2007-09-05T08:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	:-( that's not good.  MS Outlook does that for .doc ... and if we want .odt to compete we need things like that
2007-09-05T08:42:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	I was looking through the thunderbird plugins, was hoping someone here heard of it... guess not
2007-10-05T07:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	ifconfig -a iface
2007-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	it worked :-) you rock
2007-10-10T15:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	diff -ur folder1 folder2 ??
2007-10-10T15:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	ah, the -u may do it
2007-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	nope....  same output... just says that there is a different file... probably wouldn'y make the kind of patch to create it :-(
2007-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	no it is -N
2007-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	diff -Nur folder1 folder2 ??
2007-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	ah, SWEET
2007-10-10T15:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	-u is for unified format and r recursive
2007-10-10T15:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	  wow... the N did it... I didn't figure that out from looking at the man page... it's like -N treat absent files as empty... didn't register in my head
2007-10-10T15:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	thank you :-)
2007-10-10T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	no problem
2007-12-12T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	the router only does port forwarding to the computer gnutella works
2007-12-12T03:52:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	ssooo.... there can only be one computer behind it that connects?
2007-12-12T03:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	it can be the case my home router works that way you can open ports to specific hosts (one by one) but not to all the hosts at once
2007-12-12T03:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	i can configure it for as much computers as i want though but it is tedious
2007-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	hhmmmm.  So... I should probably just rig it by turning off one computer, and then restarting the router, so that the other one can get the port?
2007-12-12T03:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	no, you should check your router configuration and see if the ports gnutella uses are being forwarded to the two computers...
2007-12-12T03:56:00.000Z	hendrixski	erUSUL	ok, I'll hunt down some documentation on how to do that.  Thanks :-)
2007-12-12T03:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	hendrixski	no problem
