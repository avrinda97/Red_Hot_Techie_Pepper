2006-11-24T12:08:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	Check your ram.
2006-11-24T12:09:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	run the whole test?
2006-11-24T12:09:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	Yes, get a RAM tester -- that is most likely a bad ram error. --
2006-11-24T12:10:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	i'm using the memtest+86
2006-11-24T12:11:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	Do the full test, it will take some time -- but it will be worth it to know if you have bad ram, it will save you time -- and frustration.
2006-11-24T12:11:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	cd boots up fine buth wen i boot the enter to ubuntu or install it just wont go in
2006-11-24T12:12:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	so i might have bad ram?
2006-11-24T12:12:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	I'd say with 90% certainty that is your problem -- bad ram, or bad slots.
2006-11-24T12:13:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	kk thnx
2006-11-24T12:34:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	wat if i boot ubuntu on my other pc that worked with my ram???\
2006-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	Should if your ram is good on that PC :) if you still reach an error on another PC -- with the same error code, it could be a bad CD -- the 10% :P
2006-11-24T12:36:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	its not the cd i used it on other pcs worked perfect
2006-11-24T12:36:00.000Z	justin_	mat1	Alright then like I said test your ram, thats most likely your problem.
2006-11-24T12:37:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	yea my other haves 512 in it it works and its got 3 slots so i'm adding my to it
2006-11-24T12:37:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	it wont even boot in live desktop
2006-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	be back
2006-11-24T12:42:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	it works fine wuith my ram
2006-11-24T12:49:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	my ram works fine in the other pc and same cd
2006-11-24T12:51:00.000Z	mat1	justin_	i guess its my motherboard:(
