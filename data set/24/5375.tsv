2006-08-05T06:51:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	what do you mean? just apt-get install w32codecs (if you have multiverse repositories set up)
2006-08-05T06:54:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	i do not have multiverse repositories setup
2006-08-05T06:55:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	okay, np. Open up System -> Administration -> Software Properties
2006-08-05T06:56:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	then scroll down to where it says (in small type) Community maintained (Universe). Let me know if there's any other small-type there.
2006-08-05T06:57:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	yeah select the binary and source??
2006-08-05T06:57:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	yes, but does it also have small type that says "Non-free (Multiverse)"?
2006-08-05T06:58:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	yeah thats already been checke
2006-08-05T07:03:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	should like like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/i19737 then, right?
2006-08-05T07:04:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	yes it does look like that
2006-08-05T07:04:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	then, if you've just checked the box by that, close the window, and it should ask you to refresh source lists or something.
2006-08-05T07:05:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	done that
2006-08-05T07:06:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	and it refreshed the lists? If so, then just do sudo apt-get install w32codecs.
2006-08-05T07:07:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	more info from ubotu ^^
2006-08-05T07:07:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	it did not refresh it just closed :s
2006-08-05T07:08:00.000Z	micahcowan	linuxd00d	then do a "sudo apt-get update" first, before that other command.
2006-08-05T07:11:00.000Z	linuxd00d	micahcowan	the command does not work
