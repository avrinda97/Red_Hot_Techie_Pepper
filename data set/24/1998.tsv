2009-05-25T20:38:00.000Z	nimda_		hey guys i need help
2009-05-25T20:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	ok just ask your question
2009-05-25T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	not not exacty,  and yes Wubi is not that good
2009-05-25T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	get hold of data,  remove wubi, and dual boot
2009-05-25T20:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	or maybe  even get rid of Windows, depending on what you want to do,  if you want to 3D Windows game for example well you need Windows really
2009-05-25T20:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	and for non 3D stuff  and stuff like that, with enough RAM you can virtual machine Windows inside Ubuntu
2009-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	thats the only reason i'm keeping it..for gaming
2009-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	ok
2009-05-25T20:43:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	yep i think im comfortable with ubuntu now, havent booted to windows for about a month..
2009-05-25T20:43:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	about my question..is that the best solution?
2009-05-25T20:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	well sure Ubuntu basics,  well not much of a learning curve,   unlike certain more advanced distros where there is quite a learning curve to begin with
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	is what the best solution?
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	to move the ubuntu windows installation to a different drive
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	you can't just do that
2009-05-25T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	and if iti s possible, it's  rather difficult and  not the best thing to do
2009-05-25T20:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	what you should do as I already said is get hold of any data from  Wubi,  get rid of Wubi.   and dual boot Ubuntu
2009-05-25T20:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	when I say dual boot I mean download the CD ISO,  md5sum check it :)   and burn to CD, boot computer from it and install
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	ok thanks, just checkin if that is possible..got the cd..i think ill do as u told
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	XP or VIsta on there?
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	XP
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	ok if it had been VIsta,  well it's better to let it resize it's own partition
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	since possible dataloss
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nimda_	,but your XP so it's fine
2009-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	nimda_	sebsebseb	wont be a problem i gues..its on a different partition
