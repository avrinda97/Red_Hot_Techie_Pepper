2007-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-radeon.html is a start, it also has a link to a wiki that has howtos
2007-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Elite.. wiki for specific ubuntu install/setup ?
2007-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	it used to, I don't know if they've updated since the last driver release
2007-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	in fact, http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu
2007-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	also, I'd recommend doing a search on ubuntuforums.org for your card, and seeing if anyone has done it
2007-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	I was asking the room :) but it's actually an ATI script that's supposed to check your machine to make sure you meet all pre-requisites for the drivers
2007-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Oh.. Yeah, I know how to run scripts
2007-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	I'm actually just in here trying to get this video ard working for a buddy of mine
2007-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	could you tell me how to launch this script? Just clicking it doesn't do anything. Damn my years of windows and linux noobiness.
2007-07-03T13:23:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	sh ati-whatever.run
2007-07-03T13:23:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	it's called check.sh
2007-07-03T13:25:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Do what I said. chmod +x check.sh and then when you want to run it you just do ./check.sh or wherever it is.. /home/erdaron/check.sh
2007-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	alright, that did it... but it says "not running from the console or do not have console ownership" even if I run it as sudo
2007-07-03T13:27:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Whats in your script ?
2007-07-03T13:28:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Use the pastebin and lets see whats in your script
2007-07-03T13:30:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28302/
2007-07-03T13:31:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Oh, its that ati script
2007-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	I guess all it really needs is to check version of XFree86. Terminal from Applications / Accessories?
2007-07-03T13:32:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Run that thing on the console (ctrl+alt+F1), see what happens..
2007-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	same thing happened :)
2007-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	No idea
2007-07-03T13:38:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	any other way I can check the version of XFree86?
2007-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	Erdaron	Xfree86 is xorg now
2007-07-03T13:51:00.000Z	Erdaron	EvilDennisR	did you find the info you were looking for?
