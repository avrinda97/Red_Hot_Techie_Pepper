2006-12-30T07:09:00.000Z	Rug		Ack, help.  I have just done a reinstall this time to edgy, and now X just displays garbage on the screen.  I have run the dpkg-reconfigure, and edited my xorg.conf down to nill, all to no avail.  The last config attempt locked up my PC (solid red-screen in X untill I could swap tty's and kill it).  Any Advice?

2006-12-30T07:11:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	composite is not "on"
2006-12-30T07:11:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	edgy has it on unless you explicitely turn it off
2006-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	one sec, I'll find the magic incantation for you
2006-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	right now I am CLI only.  Xorg has no mention of it
2006-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	I'll look again
2006-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	that'll turn it off if you put that section in your xorg.conf
2006-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	ahh Got it.
2006-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	That didn't help.
2006-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	still dieing
2006-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	yeah..
2006-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	do you get any further if you choose vesa as your driver when you dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	(not a final solution, but should give a working setup)
2006-12-30T07:20:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	thanks will try
2006-12-30T07:21:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	yeah, that gave me a desktop.  Thanks

2006-12-30T07:21:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	Nvidia 6600GT
2006-12-30T07:22:00.000Z	cwillu	Rug	sorry, don't know much about nvidea;  only dealt with intel and ati so far
2006-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	Rug	cwillu	It's just edgy that is giving me a hard time.  I've been using Nividia fine since "Warty"
