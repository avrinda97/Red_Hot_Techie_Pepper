2010-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	histo		What is polipo?
2010-03-20T07:20:00.000Z	histo		nvm figured it out
2010-03-20T07:20:00.000Z	histo		When tor is installed does it run all the time by default? Allowing other people to browse through me?
2010-03-20T07:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	no
2010-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	the default conf sets it as a client
2010-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	so with it installed I could just start using torbutton right?
2010-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	not sure, what does the torbutton do?
2010-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	its a firefox addon to enable disable tor
2010-03-20T07:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	don't you need to tell firefox about tor being a proxy?
2010-03-20T07:24:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	thats what the button handles it looks like
2010-03-20T07:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	what about privoxy?
2010-03-20T07:25:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	looks like polipo is being used
2010-03-20T07:26:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	cool
2010-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	tor is listening for polipo on 9050
2010-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	yeah its there on 9050 but its not working
2010-03-20T07:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	tor is on 9050, tor must get its input from the web proxy (polipo??), so the browser needs to point at the polipo port
2010-03-20T07:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	tor is a socks proxy
2011-10-19T07:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	some? just pick some?
2011-10-19T07:47:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	well the relevant settings for that application would make sense
2011-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	you could apt-cache showpkg kubuntu-desktop  and see
2011-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	We're not running kde
2011-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	histo	how about if I just look it up in synaptic
2011-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	there ya go
2011-12-19T05:10:00.000Z	histo	almoxarife	there ya go
