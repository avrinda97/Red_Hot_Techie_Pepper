2006-05-16T12:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	logout, then login again to gnome.
2006-05-16T12:39:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	you mean reboot?
2006-05-16T12:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	no, restart X. hit ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-05-16T12:39:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	and how do i get back?
2006-05-16T12:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	type 'gdm' -- it should take you back to the login screen automatically. If it takes you to the console, just type 'gdm'.
2006-05-16T12:43:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	same error
2006-05-16T12:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	are you running a standard installation? nothing custom?
2006-05-16T12:44:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	its totally custom
2006-05-16T12:44:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	I followed the world of warcraft instructions wiki
2006-05-16T12:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	I meant, your X setup.
2006-05-16T12:45:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingWineFromSource
2006-05-16T12:45:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	no idea what you mean about x setup
2006-05-16T12:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	by the way, I had WoW running under Wine on X, but due to the lame drivers from ATI, I didn't use it.
2006-05-16T12:46:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	do you mean my xorg.conf file?
2006-05-16T12:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	daryl	no, but I don't know what could be your problem. I compiled wine from source (but not using that wiki article). It worked for me so I don't know what you did there.
2006-05-16T12:47:00.000Z	daryl	fyrestrtr	no idea what to do then?
