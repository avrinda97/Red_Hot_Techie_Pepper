2010-07-17T05:30:00.000Z	s4a		why doesn't dd if=/home/deniz/Desktop/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=4M;sync make my flash drive bootable? on this comp when i do that, when I plug in the flash drive; it acts somewhat like a CD but on my (usb-boot capable) comp (this one is also usb-boot capable) this exact command (with a different iso filename of course) works for opensuse)
2010-07-17T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 because its an iso file.. You need to use unetbootin, or the usb-disk-creator tool to make a bootable flash frion an iso
2010-07-17T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 there ARE some disrtos/isos out there tyat you can dd to a usb and have them work.. but not many do it that way
2010-07-17T05:31:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	but it worked with opensuse live cd iso image
2010-07-17T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 as i said.. SOME can work..
2010-07-17T05:32:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	so it's the way the OS was designed rather than dd ?
2010-07-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 you got it.
2010-07-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 the dd is a neat trick. but it can waste some space on larger flash drives. :)
2010-07-17T05:32:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	MaRk-I, can i do that through debian?
2010-07-17T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 i just use grub2 to boot the iso files.
2010-07-17T05:33:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	i have a messed up lvm system im trying to rescue
2010-07-17T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	  theres other tools to make a usb from ubuntu iso files.. see the pendrivelinux web site for some.  theres unetbootin, and lili, and some others also
2010-07-17T05:35:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	can i use windows software through wine to do this?
2010-07-17T05:36:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	o wait unetbootin looks like it might be good
2010-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	ok so is unetbootin for linux a graphical program?
2010-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 has windows and linux ports.
2010-07-17T05:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 usb-disk-creator is the tool in the ubuntu  os normally used.  Pendrivelinux.com has other tools for windows and other os's also
2010-07-17T05:52:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	unetbootin works for all distros?
2010-07-17T05:56:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	it seems to be a godsend :) ur a godsend :D
2010-07-17T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 for most all. it just extracts the files and sets up syslinux properly
2010-07-17T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 i like the 'use grub2 to boot iso files' trick. but ive not seen a tool to automate that yet.
2010-07-17T05:58:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	for that to work you need a linux OS already installed don't you?
2010-07-17T05:58:00.000Z	s4a	Dr_Willis	(in the computer you want to boot it on)
2010-07-17T05:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	s4a	 theres othe rways to isnstall grub2 :)    a live cd can do it also
