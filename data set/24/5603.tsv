2006-06-06T10:16:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	is your windows boot.ini on a ntfs partition?
2006-06-06T10:17:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you created a new partiton, and now your boot.ini points to the wrong one
2006-06-06T10:19:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you can mount ntfs just not write to it
2006-06-06T10:19:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you might try booting with your windows cd and running repair, then run fixboot
2006-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	i know, but that will mess up grub so I won't be able to boot into linux
2006-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	grub is easy to reinstall after that
2006-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	but how, I can't install grub from windows..
2006-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you can use your ubuntu cd
2006-06-06T10:22:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you just mount your ubuntu partiton, then run chroot on it
2006-06-06T10:22:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	then you can run grub-install
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	it'll just reload grub into your mbr
2006-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	whatever is in your menu.list now will be there
2006-06-06T10:26:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	when you get to that point and boot up the live cd, come back here and I'll walk you through it
2006-06-06T12:36:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	you're in the live cd?
2006-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	yes, im in the live CD
2006-06-06T12:39:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	which partition is ubuntu on?
2006-06-06T12:39:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	i THINK ubuntu is on /dev/sda5
2006-06-06T12:41:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	mount it at /media/ubuntu, mkdir /media/ubuntu then mount /dev/sda5 /media/ubuntu
2006-06-06T12:41:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	then run sudo chroot /mount/ubuntu
2006-06-06T12:42:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	it says cannot run command bin/bash
2006-06-06T12:43:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	yes
2006-06-06T12:44:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	is your mbr on /dev/sda
2006-06-06T12:46:00.000Z	Tobberoth	chavo	what do i open device.map with?
2006-06-06T12:48:00.000Z	chavo	Tobberoth	yeah that should be working
