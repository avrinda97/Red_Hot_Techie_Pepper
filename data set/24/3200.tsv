2012-10-18T15:55:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	probably at metacity properties under gconf-editor
2012-10-18T15:55:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	 there used to be a sort of  "low resources" settings
2012-10-18T15:56:00.000Z	Guillem_		setting
2012-10-18T15:56:00.000Z	akis		i look at this right now
2012-10-18T15:57:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	gconf_editor->/aps/metacity/general/reduced_resources
2012-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	akis		do i have to check it? probably yes?
2012-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	yes
2012-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	akis		that it. great. now is working very very fast.
2012-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	the "long description" tells what it actually does
2012-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	akis		yes i know. i used already gconfig to customize windos buttons form left to right.
2012-10-18T16:02:00.000Z	akis		one more question. when my gnome classic is loading 'konversation' or is emptying my trash in dolphin i can see in my panel running something starting from k...(must be a kde source). this doesnt happen under xcfe. is it possible to disable it? after some seconds it auto disappeares
2012-10-18T16:10:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	I would say that you have something in your session
2012-10-18T16:10:00.000Z	Guillem_		try gnome-session-properties
2012-10-18T16:11:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	kde has a GUI for the session as well, and as far as I can tell, they tend to mix things one to the other
2012-10-18T16:12:00.000Z	akis		gnome-session-properties opens my startup applications
2012-10-18T16:13:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	check there is no entry with a "k..." at the beginning
2012-10-18T16:13:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	just a gess
2012-10-18T16:13:00.000Z	Guillem_		guess
2012-10-18T16:13:00.000Z	akis	Guillem_	nothing. i have only thunderbird and nvidia driver
2012-10-18T16:13:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	OK, forget it
2012-10-18T16:14:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	I would say that when you start a KDE app (konversation, dolphin, ...) it does start some KDE services. What you see is that.
2012-10-18T16:14:00.000Z	akis	Guillem_	yes thats right. but it happens only in gnome classic. not in unity, not in gnome 3 and as i wrote already not in xcfe under xubuntu 12.04. why?
2012-10-18T16:15:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	probably what happens is that xfce and gnome-3 don't care to show that in their "systray" whereas gnome-classic uses an older "systray" concept that gets puzzled and shows that
2012-10-18T16:16:00.000Z	Guillem_	akis	very few people use gnome-classic, you know...
