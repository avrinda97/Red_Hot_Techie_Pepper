2005-04-08T07:07:00.000Z	Zedtech		you know whats ticking me off right now? "mount: error while guessing filesystem type; mount: you must specifiy the filesystem type"
2005-04-08T07:07:00.000Z	Zedtech		I specify ntfs and it tells me i'm wrong :(
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech		no fat support in the kernel?
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	fat is supported
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	use fat or vfat
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech		-t vfat is all I can work with
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech		-t fat doesntw ork
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	vfat=fat32
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech		I know
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech		I know
2005-04-08T07:09:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	I'm having more problems with my NTFS drives
2005-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	captive ntfs?
2005-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	no idea. I just know its NTFS.
2005-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	Im retarded at fs types
2005-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	install captive ntfs to add full ntfs support to linux
2005-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	captive ntfs is a wrapper that allows you to use the ntfs "driver" from win2k on linux
2005-04-08T07:11:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	oh that; i've worked with that before. (Sorry, its been awhile since I've used any nix distrobution). I may just go ahead and do that; but before I do that, any idea on why mount keeps telling me that im specifying the wrong fs type? (mount -t ntfs /dev/hdd1 /mnt/bigdrive; mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock)
2005-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	are you sure it's ntfs?
2005-04-08T07:12:00.000Z	Zedtech		positive
2005-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	I just want to get to my music
2005-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	ubuntu kernel might not have ntfs support. It doesn't matter anyways, since the kernel only includes an RO driver
2005-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	maxchee	Zedtech	just install captive ntfs and be done with it
2005-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	Its supposedly in there. I may just go get captive ntfs.
2005-04-08T07:13:00.000Z	Zedtech	maxchee	I'll be back, I'm going to go setup captive ntfs
