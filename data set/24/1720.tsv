2010-04-22T14:38:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	You choose the partition, you right click it, you "Resize", you "Apply"
2010-04-23T13:26:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	you need ntfsprogs
2010-04-23T13:27:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	sudo aptitude install  ntfsprogs ?
2010-04-23T13:27:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	yes
2010-04-23T13:34:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	ok i did that, now what do i have to do to mount ntfs partitions and external drives?
2010-04-23T13:35:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	Just use uhhh... sudo mount /dev/yourntfspartition /mnt/someplace
2010-04-23T13:36:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	but if im on gnome, wouldnt it be suposed to mount upon plugin?
2010-04-23T13:37:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	hm. Wait, maybe another package is responsible for mounting as such, but it shoulda be pulled with ntfsprogs... who knows though, I did not use hardy. Try "sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g"
2010-04-23T13:37:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	whats the dif between that and what i just got?
2010-04-23T13:37:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	ntfsprogs is a metapackage with tools for NTFS device management
2010-04-23T13:38:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	ntfs-3g is already the newest version.
2010-04-23T13:39:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	*huh* maybe GNOME does not understand what to do :D Dunno, use the CLI to mount. You might of also have to use sudo ntfs-3g somedevice someplace instead of sudo mount somedevice someplace
2010-04-23T13:39:00.000Z	zebastian	theadmin	but i d0nt know cli
2010-04-23T13:40:00.000Z	theadmin	zebastian	Just use the command I gave.
