2010-09-01T02:25:00.000Z	mikeliss		Anybody have any ideas what's going on here: http://pastie.org/1129999
2010-09-01T02:25:00.000Z	mikeliss		I swear I did nothing to provoke this.
2010-09-01T02:26:00.000Z	mikeliss		any thoughts on how to deal with gdebi being borked? It seems that a bunch of my programs now no longer work, and I have no idea why this is or what happened.
2010-09-01T02:27:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	The "Input/output error" error is important.  Before making any more package changes, look at your /var/log/messages file for disk problems.
2010-09-01T02:35:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Yeah, Input/Output errors don't bode well, but I'm not seeing any errors in /var/log/messages...
2010-09-01T02:35:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	At least not any obvious ones...
2010-09-01T02:36:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	  `cd /var/cache/apt/archives` and `dpkg --install` the gdebi packages manually.
2010-09-01T02:37:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Hrm...I already did apt-get clean...I'm guessing there will be no cache...
2010-09-01T02:39:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	The front-end tools like apt and aptitude are stuck until you get the bad gdebi package reinstalled.   Do an `apt-get install --reinstall gdebi` to get the package, and do the dpkg afterwards.
2010-09-01T02:41:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Hrmm...I tried that, but I'm not seeing anything in /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-09-01T02:42:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	 apt-get should download the deb to /var/cache/apt/archives.  If it isn't there, then you have another problem.
2010-09-01T02:43:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Hm. Perhaps I have another problem. The only things I see there are an empty directory called "partial" and a file called "lock"
2010-09-01T02:43:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	 If the packaging system is broken, then don't use any of the fancy front ends.  Use only dpkg and apt until the packaging system is repaired.
2010-09-01T02:43:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	On a related (?) note, it seems all the mono apps on my system won't start...which is interesting.
2010-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	can you help me with using those?
2010-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	Pastebin verbose apt-get output.
2010-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	for what command? Just apt-get?
2010-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	I'm out of time.  Somebody else might help you.
2010-09-01T02:44:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	OK, thanks anyway for the help. I'll continue poking around until I can get this thing working again....ugh.
2010-09-01T02:46:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	Assuming that your hardware is good and your filesystem is intact, the solution for packaging failures like this is usually `dpkg --purge --force MyBadPackage` followed by a manual `dpkg --install MyBadPackage.deb`.
2010-09-01T02:47:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Hrmm...unknown force option 'gdebi'
2010-09-01T02:48:00.000Z	dajhorn	mikeliss	`man dpkg` and search for the appropriate --force-* option.  There are several.
2010-09-01T02:48:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Yeah...I'm looking into that now...
2010-09-01T02:51:00.000Z	mikeliss	dajhorn	Hmmm...this is VERY suspicious: Another I/O problem: http://pastie.org/1130070
