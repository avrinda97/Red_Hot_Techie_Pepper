2009-11-01T15:01:00.000Z	aaron11		Is there a way to downgrade Ubuntu One client
2009-11-01T15:01:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	If you're getting a capabilities mismatch, you actually want to *upgrade* in this case.
2009-11-01T15:02:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	Nope it says I have a newer version so the server is not compatible with it
2009-11-01T15:02:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	om26er: Yes, but that's a lie.
2009-11-01T15:06:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	apt-cache policy python-ubuntuone-client
2009-11-01T15:06:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Which version does it say you have installed?
2009-11-01T15:07:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	say that again
2009-11-01T15:07:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Run 'apt-cache policy python-ubuntuone-client', and tell me which version it says you have installed.
2009-11-01T15:11:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Have you logged out and in again?
2009-11-01T15:12:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Do so, please.
2009-11-01T15:12:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	I suspended tho
2009-11-01T15:12:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	That is insufficient.
2009-11-01T15:15:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	YES! Thank You very much
2009-11-01T15:15:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Excellent.
2009-11-01T15:15:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	:-/
2009-11-01T15:15:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	I can only connect for a while
2009-11-01T15:16:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	What does it do then?
2009-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	On my tray it shows a white cloud when connected and after 7-12 second it shows a blank colud with an "!" mark.
2009-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	wgrant	aaron11	Are you somehow firewalled?
2009-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	I didnt set it up
2009-11-01T15:18:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	 It says it is connecting but then fails
2009-11-01T15:21:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	It trys to connect but fails. And I dont think I setup a firewall
2009-11-01T15:37:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	Do you know why it says its connecting but then disconnects
2009-11-01T15:39:00.000Z	aaron11	wgrant	Any ideal
