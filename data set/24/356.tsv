2012-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	What is your level of expertise? You could, e.g., improve bug reports, fix bugs, or translate packages
2012-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	i'm kinda newbie to testing
2012-08-07T23:17:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	but i like to do some testing work
2012-08-07T23:19:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	OK, you could, for example, test daily ISO images or stable release upgrades
2012-08-07T23:20:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	can you expain me?
2012-08-07T23:22:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	ISO testing is testing Ubuntu ISO images built every day to check that all basic functionalities work, this is especially important before a release takes place.
2012-08-07T23:23:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	is need to install on hdd or vm
2012-08-07T23:23:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	A VM is enough in most cases, real hardware is preferred though.
2012-08-07T23:23:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	Testing stable release upgrades is a more "ongoing" type of work, you will need to check if fixes proposed for particular bugs are effective and do not impact stability.
2012-08-07T23:24:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	that is interesting
2012-08-07T23:24:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	Mind if we continue to chat in private so as to free the channel a bit?
2012-08-07T23:25:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	k
2012-08-08T13:30:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	Yes, the first command creates a key, the second one prints a hash of an already existing one for verification purposes
2012-08-08T13:32:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	You can use an unlimited key without problems
2012-08-08T13:37:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	GPG creates both a secret (private) key and a public key, just like PGP.
2012-08-08T13:40:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	It's a subkey - each of them is associated with a specific e-mail address (so you can use a single key to encrypt e-mails for multiple accounts)
2012-08-08T13:42:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	For example, if you've got two accounts "1@email.com" and "2@email.com", and I want to use a GPG key to encrypt and/or sign e-mails coming from both of them, I can simply create a single key with two subkeys, one for "1@email.com" and "2@email.com".
2012-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	savio	elgaton	mail from BugSqurd are PGP guard
2012-08-08T13:45:00.000Z	elgaton	savio	Most of them are not, you will need a PGP key to submit patches though.
