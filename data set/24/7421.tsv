2005-05-06T12:54:00.000Z	scizzo		downclimb: you do that with lilo or grub
2005-05-06T05:33:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	what planet are you from?
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	thank you...
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	stop talking nonsense, oo does not take anywhere near that much ram, thats beyond wrong
2005-05-06T05:34:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	are you always this nice to people?
2005-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	load up a huge document, maybe you start to run out of ram, but that statement is ridiculous
2005-05-06T05:35:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	well, tell me i'm wrong? telling someone oo takes 256 megs of ram is wrong.  period.
2005-05-06T05:36:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	well you can still be a little nicer to people...having a attitude like that does not help much
2005-05-06T05:36:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	lol sorry, your right :)
2005-05-06T05:37:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	exactly, 256 is enough for most average workloads *nod*
2005-05-06T05:38:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	however if you could tell him how to view what is using most of the memory then maybe he could find the answer on his own...
2005-05-06T05:39:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	however suggested for Win: 2.0 is 256
2005-05-06T05:39:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	and using Mac OS X: using neooffice is also 256
2005-05-06T05:40:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	from the oo.org site?
2005-05-06T05:40:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	its suggested
2005-05-06T05:42:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	:) *nod* he will still be fine with 256, no question about that, i'm just hammering away at some of wdh's assumptions as they vaguely smell of 'why does ms office start so fast' kinda deal :)
2005-05-06T05:42:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	well I will go back to my planet and then be even more wrong about things...shouldn't I?
2005-05-06T05:43:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	rofl :) sorry, i'm a little edgy, my appologies
2005-05-06T05:44:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	bottom line, i've run gnome on 64 megs ram, it can be done, saying 256 is not enough is not correct, he should be able to do gimp and oo.o and a whole bunch of things with 256 megs ram without much swapping at all
2005-05-06T05:49:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	also please take my appology with the following perspective, i think it's important to try to stamp out misconceptions as much as possible, it's important to be vigilant on that front
2005-05-06T05:53:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	explaining to hard with an attitude can also scare them...
2005-05-06T05:53:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	who would you listen to? the person explaining slowly and with a smile? or the person being angry and looking at you like you know nothing at all?
2005-05-06T05:54:00.000Z	holycow	scizzo	you are correct *nod* sorry again :)
2005-05-06T05:56:00.000Z	scizzo	holycow	something I have learned after having a teacher almost taking away my grades even though I had the highest grades on everything....the only thing was that I was nothing he liked to talk to
