2012-01-31T05:59:00.000Z	JermBob		preludelinux
2012-01-31T05:59:00.000Z	JermBob		to

2012-01-31T05:59:00.000Z	JermBob		2gig
2012-01-31T06:01:00.000Z	JermBob		is that just a installer for ubuntu that runs on windows that then you boot to run ubuntu ?
2012-01-31T06:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	Wubi isn't the greatest idea ever.  It makes ubuntu reliant on windows...  Dual-booting is better if you plan to keep your install.  If you just want to "try" ubuntu, wubi is fine (easy removal).
2012-01-31T06:03:00.000Z	JermBob	zykotick9	im under the impression i can run a ubuntu shell from a usb stick within windows
2012-01-31T06:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	maybe?
2012-01-31T06:03:00.000Z	JermBob	zykotick9	fair comment
2012-01-31T06:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	i'd personally suggest the same as bobweaver use VBox
2012-01-31T12:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	openssh-server i believe (or perhaps the ssh metapackage for both client/server)
2012-01-31T12:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	apt-get install foo
2012-01-31T12:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	it's not supported here
2012-03-26T16:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	vnc is slow... actually, gui remote desktop is slow...
2012-03-26T16:37:00.000Z	JermBob	zykotick9	can i make it faster some how ?
2012-03-26T16:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	i don't use remote GUI stuff (i personally think it's silly), but i hear FreeNX is faster then VNC
2012-03-26T16:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	i do however use ssh with x forwarding sometimes
2012-03-26T16:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	i can open GUI programs, just not the desktop
2012-03-26T16:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	that would make sense!  glad you fixed it.
2012-03-26T16:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	^
2012-03-26T16:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	JermBob	"man hier"
