2007-08-22T07:17:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	You need to open a !terminal and type telnet <server>
2007-08-22T07:35:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	If you want to talk about it, I suggest we move the converstation in #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-08-23T09:36:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	sudo apt-get install wine
2007-08-23T09:38:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Why don't you want to install it from the repos?
2007-08-23T09:40:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Its much better to install it from the repositories. That way if theres an upgrade, it gets updated automatically.
2007-08-23T09:43:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Do you also want to use it as a desktop computer?
2007-08-23T09:44:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Then ubuntu-desktop is better
2007-08-23T09:45:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	You can do whatever you want.
2007-08-23T09:55:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Where are you trying to extract the file?
2007-08-23T09:55:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	1) You can only do that with sudo 2) Why would you want to do that, that sounds bad.
2007-08-23T09:56:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	You have your own folder in /home
2007-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/
2007-08-23T10:13:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	Have you tried running it off your desktop?
2007-08-23T10:14:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	by doing wine program.exe?
2007-08-23T10:16:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	so move it to the folder I suggsted, you can use ctrl-h in nautilus to show hidden files and folders like .wine
2007-09-06T10:37:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	find /dir/to/search/in -name filename
2007-09-06T11:48:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	What are you trying to do? if you have been installing all the updates that become available, you are up to date with the current wine version.
2007-09-06T11:50:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	sudo apt-get remove dante-server
2007-09-06T11:51:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	I dont know. Why did you install dante?
2007-09-06T11:52:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	You should check out the documentation for dante then.
2007-09-06T12:02:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	gdm = gnome display manager = the screen you see when you login
2007-09-11T14:46:00.000Z	Pici	jesson	you need to compile your c++ programs
