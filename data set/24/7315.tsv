2007-02-20T09:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	we heard you the first time
2007-02-20T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 drag the icon to the panel. see what command its running? try running th esame command from a shell.. perhaps.
2007-02-20T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 im not even sure what you mean by the 'login window'   you mean the configuration tool for gdm/kdm ?
2007-02-20T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 im not using gnome.. so the menu items mean nothing to me.
2007-02-20T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 whis is why i suggested finding out what command its actually running.
2007-02-20T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 of course it may be somthing more basic.. You are trying to run this as your first user?
2007-02-20T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 it then wants the first users password.
2007-02-20T09:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 you are runnign this under  your initial first user you made account?
2007-02-20T09:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	  kde shouldent be affecting that at all.. i always install kde on the ubuntu systems i have.. and visa-versa
2007-02-20T09:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 then WHY are you trying to run gdmsetup? you want to run the kdm setup tool..
2007-02-20T09:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	  i think theres a command like  'sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm'
2007-02-20T09:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 that asks what to use
2007-02-20T09:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 try some of the other admin type tools.. it may be some deeper issue.
2007-02-20T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tahsin	 im thinking you got deeper issues.. installing kde shouldent mess with that either.
