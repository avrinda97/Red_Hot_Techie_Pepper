2005-12-26T10:33:00.000Z	Eleaf	starpause	go to System, Administration, Networking, select eth0 and click activate

2005-12-26T10:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	starpause	first go into the Ethernet connections properties and click enable this connection
2005-12-26T10:34:00.000Z	Eleaf	starpause	it doesn't say Ethernet connection?
2005-12-26T10:35:00.000Z	starpause	Eleaf	no, only the modem connection is showing up
2005-12-26T10:36:00.000Z	starpause	Eleaf	actually, it might not be supported ... it's a wireless card and i'm not seeing the chipset at http://linux-wless.passys.nl/
