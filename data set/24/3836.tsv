2012-06-10T05:29:00.000Z	joanne		ok guys, how do I upgrade jaunty using a CD?
2012-06-10T05:29:00.000Z	joanne		I have a hardy cd but it's telling me that there is a network error
2012-06-10T05:31:00.000Z	bazhang	joanne	live cd for an earlier version wont do that.   jaunty is long end of life, so see the link above
2012-06-10T05:31:00.000Z	bazhang	joanne	for future reference, the alternative cd for an equal or higher version could be used to upgrade
2012-06-10T05:32:00.000Z	joanne	bazhang	thanks, I was having issues getting hardy to run on the laptop
2012-06-10T05:38:00.000Z	joanne	bazhang	it doesn't work
2012-06-10T05:39:00.000Z	bazhang	joanne	what doesnt work. explain exactly what you did as outlined in the eolupgrades link that does not work. paste.ubuntu.com with the exact errors
2012-06-10T05:40:00.000Z	joanne	bazhang	I added the source list and it still says network error

2012-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	joanne	bazhang	you saw my previous reply, yes?
