2006-06-03T13:16:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	am glad i am not alone....same here 3d no work on radeon 9000 trxing 2 days
2006-06-03T13:18:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	yeah, the other day I was trying to get a radeon working on my laptop, but havn't got it yet. Now i'm trying to help a friend
2006-06-03T13:18:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	please tell me if it works for you...al that fglrx and other
2006-06-03T13:20:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	i tried the hardware section of the getting started section of ubuntu help (System>Help), but I think that is for a newer version than I have.
2006-06-03T13:20:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	mine is older than yours
2006-06-03T13:20:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	which radeon you daid you have?
2006-06-03T13:23:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	aha i see ati Rage mobility my opinion after 2 days of suffering it should do fine on clean install with open source ati drivers
2006-06-03T13:23:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	Radeon Mobility 7500
2006-06-03T13:24:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	that fglrx shit did not work for me i even think there is something missing somewhere
2006-06-03T13:59:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		the fglrx driver failed with my ATi Rage Mobility 128 AGP on my dell c600. Is there any way I can get 3D Graphics?
2006-06-03T14:00:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	which metod did u use?
2006-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/hardware.html
2006-06-03T14:01:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	wait let me see that method...i'll be back
2006-06-03T14:03:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	have you used System>Help>Ubuntu Starter Guide>Hardware>How do I install the 3D ATI video card driver?
2006-06-03T14:03:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	no that was the first method i used and it did not work for me neither...maybe you should read this
2006-06-03T14:03:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	wait a sec...
2006-06-03T14:04:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		Which was the first one you tried, the link or the help?
2006-06-03T14:05:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	well i tried about everything but do not know in which order and not always on clean install...
2006-06-03T14:07:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	you would not believe but it matters on what drivers you install with wich method...ok i think the most promissing text is on this site:http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide
2006-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	donfilipo	it says "The included fglrx driver supports Radeon 8500+ and the X-series cards up to X1900."
2006-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	i have not tried out the method 1 on that page on fresh Dapper instalation and method 2 not at all...and after 2 days wondering how i've heard the method 1 works fine on radeon 8500
2006-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		donfilipo:so it won't work with my gateway which has 7500. but maybe with the dell (rage mobility)
2006-06-03T14:10:00.000Z	donfilipo	FlyingSquirrel32	yeah mobility clean install dapper if you can and use method 1 first maybe it will do
