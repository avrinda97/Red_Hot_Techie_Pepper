2006-06-12T05:05:00.000Z	tanath		i just installed the dapper kernel, and now when i boot it hangs at a black screen. in recovery mode it says /dev/hda1 doesn't exist (!)
2006-06-12T05:07:00.000Z	tanath		arg, dapper is breaking everything :/
2006-06-12T05:07:00.000Z	nny	tanath	what do you mean?
2006-06-12T05:09:00.000Z	nny	tanath	do you have the old kernel in grub still?>
2006-06-12T05:09:00.000Z	tanath	nny	when i upgraded, it updated grub
2006-06-12T05:10:00.000Z	tanath	nny	sorry, misread. yes
2006-06-12T05:11:00.000Z	nny	tanath	hmm maybe i can help... can you give me a "gist" of what crappened?
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	nny	i've started upgrading from breezy to dapper, trying to avoid upgrading packages with bugs. i upgraded the kernel, and rebooted, and now it hangs at a black screen
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	nny	tanath	whatkernel?
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	nny	tanath	and what proc?
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	nny	the dapper one
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	nny	intel
2006-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	nny	tanath	hmm... specifics.. p4 or the like?
2006-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	nny	tanath	try this
2006-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	tanath	nny	p4, yes
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	nny	tanath	sudo aptitude install linux-686
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	nny	tanath	curoius as to what kernel got installed
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	tanath	nny	that is what i upgraded. and i can't do that now because i can't boot at all
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	nny	tanath	what about your old kernel?
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	tanath	nny	it's borked too now
2006-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	nny	tanath	you should be able to boot the old one.. otherwise the problem lies elsewhere
2006-06-12T05:15:00.000Z	nny	tanath	interesting... yeah Mr_Miyagi was thinking grub is angry
2006-06-12T05:15:00.000Z	tanath	nny	grub appears fine... it's after that
2006-06-12T05:17:00.000Z	nny	tanath	lol
