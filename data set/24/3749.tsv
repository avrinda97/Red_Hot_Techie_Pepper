2007-10-22T20:12:00.000Z	gribouille		is it possible to install ubuntu without burning a cd or dvd ?
2007-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	Yes, you can netboot.  I did that with a laptop that wouldn't boot from the CD.
2007-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	how is it done exactly ?
2007-10-22T20:14:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	You need another PC to do it though.  You could try doing a Debian install, then installing the "ubuntu-desktop" package, which should give you a full ubuntu as far as I know.
2007-10-22T20:14:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	I prefer installing ubuntu directly
2007-10-22T20:15:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	I'll look it up, it is a PXE boot.  It requires XP.  You could also use Wubi or something, if you have windows on there now
2007-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	this installation seem very complicated
2007-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	It might not be that easy to install Gutsy without a CD, or starting with debian.  The network installer I found was for Dapper, and you could go Dapper - Edgy - Feisty - Gutsy, but it is recommended that you do install - upgrade -upgrade - fresh install and so on
2007-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	I'd say look at Wubi, it is a windows installer for Ubuntu.  I'm pretty sure you can put it on a separate partition.
2007-10-22T20:19:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	It is on the Gutsy CD as far as I know too.
2007-10-22T20:20:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	could you point me to a page that describes the various installation types ?
2007-10-22T20:20:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	I don't know one page that does both, I am looking, one second
2007-10-22T20:21:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	Installing without a CD isn't the easiest.  From a USB drive might be easier, but I don't know how to do that.  One second
2007-10-22T20:23:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	http://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/index.php/Ubuntu_PXE_Install  That installs using another *nix machine.  There is a way to do it with a windows program, but I don't know it now.  The reason I suggested Debian then Ubuntu is that would be the easiest, since Debian does have a netboot install.
2007-10-22T20:24:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	ok, thanks

2007-10-22T20:26:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	is ubuntu also available on cdrom ?
2007-10-22T20:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	Yes, that is the standard way to install.  I thought you said you wanted to install without CD.  If you can install with a CD, that would be best.
2007-10-22T20:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	And very easy.  Usually.
2007-10-22T20:27:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	at first, I wanted to save a cd/dvd. but finally, it seems too complicated
2007-10-22T20:28:00.000Z	bobbob1016	gribouille	If you want to dual-boot, you could look at Wubi.  Wubi installs through windows, and you could save the CD/DVD.
2007-10-22T20:28:00.000Z	gribouille	bobbob1016	are ubuntu and kubuntu supported by the same communities ?
