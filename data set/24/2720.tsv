2008-11-07T10:01:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	 I see that it's a standard, but I don't see how to apply it to my situation
2008-11-07T10:04:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	 So I do that on dvd burning end, on my windows machine?
2008-11-07T10:05:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	 What if it isn't?  I can't use the dvd's burnt on that machine?
2008-11-07T10:06:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	 Thanks for the help, that points me in the right direction
2008-11-07T10:15:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	 My file system on the burner is ISO + Joliet, is that good enough?
2009-10-30T09:11:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Not sure what that is
2009-10-30T09:12:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Got it, not sure what to do with all of that info in the terminal though
2009-10-30T09:13:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Says it found it
2009-10-30T09:15:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	That's just it...I try to mount, and it gives me an error message that says "Unable to mount location, can't mount file"
2009-10-30T09:19:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	I right-click on the icon, select "Mount Volume"....gives me an error that says "unable to mount location, can't mount file"
2009-10-30T09:21:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	k, tried to mount via terminal, still didn't work
2009-10-30T09:23:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Do you want to see the results from the terminal when I tried to mount?
2009-10-30T09:23:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	exact command was sudo mount
2009-10-30T09:24:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	I don't know what that is
2009-10-30T09:25:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Thanks, but I need to get some files onto a usb drive tonight, normally I don't mind learning that stuff, but I'm in a crunch for time tonight
2009-10-30T09:28:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	I'm assuming fat32
2009-10-30T09:32:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	http://paste.ubuntu.com/304809/
2009-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Ok, would that be a bad drive perhaps? the usb drive itself is fubared?
2009-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	It worked fine last night
2009-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	RickZilla	n8tuser	Thanks for taking the time to help, I'll see if I can track down another drive. Your help here is very much appreciated.
