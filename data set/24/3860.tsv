2007-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	for what?
2007-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	Pidgin, gaim's successor, supports all kinds of plugins much better than gaim.
2007-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	but i have gaim
2007-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	is there any other way to have voice chatting possible?
2007-10-08T06:06:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	my advice would be to get pidgin. :P I was attached to gaim too. But other than that, I'm not sure, so sorry :)
2007-10-08T06:06:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	ok
2007-10-08T06:07:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	another problem here...ubuntu doesn't autodetect my webcam
2007-10-08T06:07:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	Have you tried plugging a camera into your machine? If it detects the camera, then it should detect the webcam, but if not, your system might have a problem.
2007-10-08T06:08:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	yes i did but ubuntu doesn't detect it
2007-10-08T06:08:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	btw, where do i plug-in the camera?
2007-10-08T06:09:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	USB port?
2007-10-08T06:10:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	ok, i asked because the camera has two cords - one for usb and the other a normal one
2007-10-08T06:10:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	do you know what type the 'normal' one is?
2007-10-08T06:11:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	it's like the one for speakers
2007-10-08T06:11:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	Okay, an audio jack. That connects the camera to the computer via a serial port
2007-10-08T06:12:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	yeah whatever
2007-10-08T06:12:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	i have tried the usb port too....doesn't work :(
2007-10-08T06:13:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	So if your camera isn't being detected via USB, try other usb ports, and if they don't work, either your system may have a problem detecting external devices, or the USB ports may not be fully functional. Try testing the USB ports with other devices to see if they work okay.
2007-10-08T06:14:00.000Z	ashu	hellhoundp2k	the usb ports are fine and the webcam worked before i had reinstalled ubuntu
2007-10-08T06:16:00.000Z	hellhoundp2k	ashu	well, you should probably look into why ubuntu isn't detecting it. I wouldn't know any more about this current situation, sorry :)
