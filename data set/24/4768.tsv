2007-02-08T14:15:00.000Z	acke_ubu		hey, i connect my usbdrive to ubuntu. the drive is found by ubuntu. but the size is wrong. it shows the drive as much smaller then it is. is there a way to get ubuntu to udate the drive size?
2007-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	How much smaller is it?
2007-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	acke_ubu		its originally 4gb but shows as 1.3gb i believe
2007-02-08T14:16:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	hmm... I'm not sure
2007-02-08T14:19:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici, it says 13811 items, totalling 1.5 GB'
2007-02-08T14:19:00.000Z	acke_ubu		and free space 49.9 MB
2007-02-08T14:20:00.000Z	acke_ubu		the drive is really a sony ericsson w950 with a 4gb built in extra drive. it works as a usb drive when connected to a computer with a usb cable
2007-02-08T14:22:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici but the real free size is something above 2gb. at least
2007-02-08T14:23:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	Check dmesg when you plug it in, see what it says the size is
2007-02-08T14:25:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	you should see something like "SCSI device sda: 3940352 512-byte hdwr sectors (2017 MB)"
2007-02-08T14:26:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici what would i write to see that?
2007-02-08T14:26:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici did i miss something you wrote?
2007-02-08T14:26:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	open a terminal, put the usb stick in then type dmesg
2007-02-08T14:27:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici  SCSI device sdb: 8026112 512-byte hdwr sectors (4109 MB)
2007-02-08T14:27:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici so its nautilus showing me wrong numbers
2007-02-08T14:28:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	Sounds like it, what do you get as the size if you type df -h in a terminal?
2007-02-08T14:28:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici is there a shortcut to get a terminal up in ubuntu? :P sry i think i saw one guy do that once. didnt catch the shortcut though
2007-02-08T14:29:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	in gnome its under accessories in the menu
2007-02-08T14:30:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici '/dev/sdb1  3.8G  3.8G   50M  99% /media/Acke'
2007-02-08T14:30:00.000Z	acke_ubu	pbureau	i meant more like a keyboard shortcut
2007-02-08T14:30:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	It looks like you only have 50mb free, but otherwise its recognizing it as the correct size
2007-02-08T14:31:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	The totalling 1.5 gb is probably just in the root folder of the directory, not including any items in subfolders
2007-02-08T14:32:00.000Z	acke_ubu		pici i see.
2007-02-08T14:32:00.000Z	Pici	acke_ubu	If you have any more issues, you may need to ask someone else.  I'm leaving my computer now, goodluck!
