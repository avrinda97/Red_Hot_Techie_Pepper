2011-08-05T21:59:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	it does. you'd be stupid if you made it work on the internet, but it does work just fine
2011-08-05T22:00:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	not really because you cant use wins over the internet. maybe cifs is working but not the real samba-deal
2011-08-05T22:00:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	and all the other strange things in a windows-network (netbios and so on)
2011-08-05T22:00:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	WINS is not cifs
2011-08-05T22:00:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	there is no netbios anymore for years. decades probably
2011-08-05T22:01:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	i know wins is not cifs
2011-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	you said cifs doesn't work over the internet and supplied WINS as why not. *shrug*
2011-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	i said the real samba-deal is not working over the internet
2011-08-05T22:02:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	ntlm, wins and so one.
2011-08-05T22:03:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	but cifs is unecrypted isnt it?
2012-10-21T14:19:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	it's a dpkg error message. aptitude won't do anything
2012-10-21T14:19:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	and the dpkg error message is crap and useless :(
2012-10-21T14:19:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	my hope was aptitude will pick up the current libc6 , he installed an older version and the repo is holding a newer one
2012-10-21T14:20:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	he tries to install a newer one and it fails. unless you know a newer one than mentioned in his paste. at which point aptitude won't help but only a different repo would
2012-10-21T14:20:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1294483/
2012-10-21T14:21:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	do you know a newer one than http://paste.ubuntu.com/1294483/
2012-10-21T14:21:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	he was 2.15-0ubuntu10.2 0 the repo has 2.15-0ubuntu10.3
2012-10-21T14:22:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	the installed 10.2 with dpkg -i
2012-10-21T14:22:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	he tries to install 10.3 which causes the error, duh
2012-10-21T14:22:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	because the 10.2 fails which je installed with dpkg -i
2012-10-21T14:23:00.000Z	wols	iceroot	please stop talking to me until you make sense. have a niec day
2012-10-21T14:23:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	... whatever..
2012-10-21T14:24:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	the old one from the repo was 10.0, he installed 10.2 with dpkg -i which failed on the depenendcies and now he is trying to install 10.3 from the repos but the 10.2 one is still broken
2012-10-21T14:25:00.000Z	iceroot	wols	but i guess you are the guru, so good luck with that
