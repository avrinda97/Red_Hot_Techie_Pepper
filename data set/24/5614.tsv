2008-05-12T12:58:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	thanks. got it solved.
2008-06-09T02:00:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	please don't refer to old posts. Repeat if you haven't received a reply (leave 10 minutes or so)
2008-06-09T02:37:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	PCI or USB?
2008-06-09T02:38:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	doesn't matter if it goes well
2008-06-09T02:39:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	there is one manufacturer with a particularly good reputation for supporting Linux driver development: Hauppauge
2008-06-09T02:40:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	do you need DVB or analog reception?
2008-06-09T02:41:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	analog I think. I have a coaxial cable internet+cable link
2008-06-09T02:41:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	where are you located?
2008-06-09T02:41:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	romanai
2008-06-09T02:41:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	romania*
2008-06-09T02:44:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	if you can have DVB reception, you should buy a DVB-C card (e.g. Hauppauge Nova-C). Otherwise, I think a good card may be one from the PVR series.
2008-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	how can I find out if I have DVB?
2008-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	ask your cable provider
2008-06-09T02:46:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	if it's something new I probably don't have it
2008-06-09T02:47:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	do ask though, or search your provider's web site for DVB
2008-06-21T03:40:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	what kind of TV card do you have?
2008-06-21T03:41:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	it's a leadtek 2000 ... donno exactly it's name, pretty old. anyway with xawtv it's working pretty fine
2008-06-21T03:44:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	it might also just go to /var/log/syslog
2008-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	"could not connect to socket" how does this sound in frontend console responses?
2008-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	is mythtv reporting that?
2008-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	yes, between other stuff
2008-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	prodigel	soundray	I'm running it from terminal, and that some of the output
2008-06-21T03:53:00.000Z	soundray	prodigel	I think you've found a clue there, but I can't think of anything to suggest (I'm a vdr user myself)
