2009-02-12T22:21:00.000Z	whut		What repository should I add so that adobe-flashprayer package would be contained within it?
2009-02-12T22:22:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	 flashprayer? :D it's in the standard Ubuntu repos (multiverse I think)
2009-02-12T22:22:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Ah, sory, it's just called flashplayer-nonfree
2009-02-12T22:39:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	do you have the right repos enabled?
2009-02-12T22:41:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	I tried to enable medibuntu, but it failed with E: Couldn't find package medibuntu-keyring
2009-02-12T22:42:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	Did you follow the wiki instructions?
2009-02-12T22:42:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Yes, help.ubuntu.com
2009-02-12T22:42:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	For intrepid: execute: "sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/intrepid.list --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list"
2009-02-12T22:43:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	then: "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get update"
2009-02-12T22:44:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Thanks, I forgot to include output . =(

2009-02-12T22:44:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	no, neither OOo 3 or KDE 4 are there
2009-02-12T22:44:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	hold on, I'll find the repos
2009-02-12T22:46:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	OOo3 repo instructions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=987181
2009-02-12T22:47:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Thanks a lot, as for KDE4.2, I've been already advised at #kubuntu
2009-02-12T22:47:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	OK, Cool
2009-02-12T23:36:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	do an apt-get clean then dist-upgrade
2009-02-12T23:36:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	apt-get -f dist-upgrade
2009-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	the repo appears to be unreachable
2009-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	is your internet connection down?
2009-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Nope, perfectly fine.
2009-02-14T02:43:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	So far reproduced the same behaviour on two separate machines in two separate networks.
2009-02-14T02:44:00.000Z	lithixium	whut	Possibly a problem with the repo itself
2009-02-14T02:44:00.000Z	whut	lithixium	Whom should I bug? =)
