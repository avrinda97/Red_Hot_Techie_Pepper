2006-06-18T15:28:00.000Z	v-mack		i use it daily without a problem
2006-06-18T15:29:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	was there anything in particualr you needed to do? I can see mine in a number of apps, and evern play from it, but cannot delete files from it... havent even tried to add files yet
2006-06-18T15:29:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	what app are you using to interface
2006-06-18T15:29:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	i use gtkpod for transfers, i have never had a problem
2006-06-18T15:30:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	I'll use whatever works, but I've tried with gtkpod... to delete... and I get these errors:
2006-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	when trying to read (though it does eventually show whats on there) Could not open "iTunesDB.ext" for reading extended info. Extended info will not be used.
2006-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	that's okay.  i get that problem too
2006-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	so just ignore that error?
2006-06-18T15:32:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	yea.  just ignore it, and then hit "read".  you should get a list of the contents of your ipod
2006-06-18T15:32:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	then you can delete
2006-06-18T15:32:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	ok so then I'll select an artist to remove... and delete it... after that I need to select Sync to apply that action right?
2006-06-18T15:32:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	you got it
2006-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	i think once you play with the contents at all in gtkpod, that error will not come up anymore
2006-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	swim	v-mack	when I select sync i get: Opening of '/media/ipod/iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesDB' for writing failed.
2006-06-18T15:34:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	danng... i remember getting that once, and i'm trying to remember what to do about it.  sorry, im racking my brain here
2006-06-18T15:34:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	i just assumed thats what happened the first tiem you tried
2006-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	v-mack	swim	i am googling your problem, cause i know i got around it
