2006-03-07T11:08:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	welcome. you found it?
2006-03-07T11:10:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	yeah that's the case.
2006-03-07T11:10:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	go to /boot/configblablah
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	or if you did this one, check in /proc/config.gz
2006-03-07T11:11:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	the proc/config.gz is a special option you have to enable, I always do
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	yeah
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	but if you don't do a make clean
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	then the rebuild will only take a few minutes
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	no you have to do "make" first
2006-03-07T11:12:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	then do that
2006-03-07T11:20:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	what do you mean again?
2006-03-07T11:21:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	what config file are ytou reading to?
2006-03-07T11:21:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	how do you know it's building as a module?
2006-03-07T11:22:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	don't do make-kpkg
2006-03-07T11:23:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	yeah, but dont' sweat it
2006-03-07T11:23:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	which config file did you change?
2006-03-07T11:23:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	that's like a backup for future reference
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	the real config that make program reads from is (in this case) at /usr/src/linux_version_/.config
2006-03-07T11:33:00.000Z	AngryElf	ssstormy	now that i have ext3 built into the kernel, I can delete the initrd line in /boot/grub/menu.lst and it should start up fine?
2006-03-07T11:34:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	yes
2006-03-07T11:34:00.000Z	AngryElf	ssstormy	intelikey, thanx for your help
2006-03-07T12:16:00.000Z	AngryElf	ssstormy	Kernel Panic'd on the new kernel......ext3 is enabled.....when I booted on this kernel it said the fs was ext2fs......however /etc/fstab says the fs is ext3.....which is it?
2006-03-07T12:17:00.000Z	ssstormy	AngryElf	umm I'm not sure... if the kernel is detecting ext2, try changing the fstab to ext2
