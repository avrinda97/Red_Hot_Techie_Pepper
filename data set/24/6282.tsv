2006-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	Gumby		if a person wants to compile a kernel for ubuntu where does one go about finding the ubuntu kernel sources?
2006-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	Gumby		thx fyrestrtr
2006-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	Gumby		if only current kernels came with proper drivers for my ati remote
2006-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	Gumby		I have to recompile the whole kernel just for one simple module
2006-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	there is a kernel source package
2006-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	go into synaptic and search for packages with linux in the name
2006-08-24T11:59:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	you need kernel headers to compiler the module, generally speaking, but you don't need to compile the entire kernel
2006-08-24T12:00:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	I need the source for the module  the .c file.
2006-08-24T12:00:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	that's the module source, not the entire kernel source
2006-08-24T12:01:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	which is in the kernel source only. if you have a better way to compile just that module using its source and insert it into my current kernel then I am all ears
2006-08-24T12:01:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	why do you believe you need a .c file that's part of the kernel, rather than part of the module you are building?
2006-08-24T12:02:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	I always install the kernel source, and that's easy to do, but it doesn't make sense.
2006-08-24T12:02:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	because I need to manually edit the .c file to change the key bindings that each button press of the remote is mapped to.
2006-08-24T12:02:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	unless I'm misunderstanding the situation.
2006-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	no, the -R before the other things
2006-08-24T12:09:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	it doesnt matter
2006-08-24T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	it may not, but you shouldn't encourage bad habits.  other commands definitely will barf.  always put your flags first
2006-08-24T12:11:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	looking at the docs, it says that the options must preceed
2006-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	the docs specify options first
2006-08-24T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	on what do you base the assertion that the docs are wrong?
2006-08-24T12:13:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	if the docs say that something MUST be done a specific way, and it works perfectly fine NOT doing it that way, then the docs are wrong
2006-08-24T12:14:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	you cannot have possibly tried all the combinations where the options might be in the wrong position and checked the results
2006-09-17T16:12:00.000Z	sethk	Gumby	xf86conf is from xfree86, which was replaced by xorg
2006-09-17T16:13:00.000Z	Gumby	sethk	I figured as much, but it was all I had to go on
