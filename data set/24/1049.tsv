2010-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	I'm not using AOL.
2010-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	okay, what version of AIM you are using?
2010-08-19T10:09:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	none
2010-08-19T10:11:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	okay, here is the list of many versions for the WineHQ, http://www.oldapps.com/aim.php . You can give them a try. One is bound to work :D
2010-08-19T10:16:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	the WineHQ won't load?
2010-08-19T10:18:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	You can try out the other AIM versions.
2010-08-19T10:20:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	do you use AIM for windows?
2010-08-19T10:22:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	yes, so I would try install the Windows AIM. The WineHQ will take care of the rest.
2010-08-19T10:22:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	do you use AIM for windows?
2010-08-19T10:23:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	good. The reason I'm trying to download it is because I'm looking for a friend I met online, I only know him by his username, is there a search option in AIM to search by username?
2010-08-19T10:24:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	actually i just know what he went by
2010-08-19T10:24:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	not his actual username
2010-08-19T10:24:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	just his alias
2010-08-19T10:25:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	I'll see if AIM have a search option.
2010-08-19T10:27:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	I can see the webpage version of AIM here. http://www.aim.com/
2010-08-19T10:28:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	or this link. http://o.aolcdn.com/aim/gromit/aim_express/gm/100426.2.4571.en-us/WidgetMain.html
2010-08-19T10:36:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	you can also let that username to search for your ID (so you don't have to).
2010-08-19T10:36:00.000Z	tonsilitis	Stale	thanks that worked!
2010-08-19T10:37:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	The "forcing the other user to find your ID" idea works?
2010-08-19T10:37:00.000Z	Stale	tonsilitis	oh, cool.
