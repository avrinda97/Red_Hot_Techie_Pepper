2009-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	losher	blz	Not sure what you mean by 'run my myth box via ssh' but a mythtv installation might not survive an upgrade. At the very least, backup your DB and anything else you can't live without *before* fiddling with your system
2009-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	blz	losher	 I just mean that I do administrative stuff at the command line (updates, installing packages, etc...)
2009-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	losher	blz	So is the backend/frontend on the machine you're upgrading or not? If it is, you need to back it all up
2009-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	blz	losher	 yeah it's a combined backend/frontend
2009-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	losher	blz	back it all up baby. What release are you upgrading from/to ?
2009-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	blz	losher	 8.10 to 9.04
2009-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	losher	blz	why bother?
2009-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	blz	losher	 honestly?  because i can.  The system's getting replaced in like 2 weeks anyway
2009-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	losher	blz	upgrading a working mythtv box to 9.04 is asking for pain without much return. If you're that bored, go watch a movie
2009-05-24T10:40:00.000Z	blz	losher	  maybe i should bust out my C for dummies book instead...
2009-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	losher	blz	a better use of your time, frankly. 9.04 is a bit unstable in parts still...
2009-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	blz	losher	 good to know.  I actually have another question... dunno if you know the answer, but is ext4 a better choice than the default XFS for myth?
2009-05-24T10:42:00.000Z	losher	blz	in my opinion, ext4 is not stable enough yet to trust on a server like mythtv where you want really good uptime.
2009-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	losher	blz	I run 8.04.2 LTS on myt backend. I notice tzanger runs slackware. Both tend to be rock solid
2009-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	losher	blz	If you want to play with 9.04, fine. Just do it on a spare box where if it all goes horribly wrong you can just wipe it & start again.
2009-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	blz	losher	 yeah I guess it is only about a month old...
2009-05-24T10:45:00.000Z	losher	blz	not only is it not very mature, they rushed it to make a 09/04 deadline & it's not clear it was quite ready
2009-05-24T10:52:00.000Z	blz	losher	 what was the name of that miniature distro you used again?
2009-05-24T10:52:00.000Z	losher	blz	I use a 2Mhz Pentium/512M memory, regular ext3 filesystem, pvr50, and for SDTV there's no stuttering. So maybe it *is* your raid stuff
2009-05-24T10:53:00.000Z	losher	blz	it was tzanger using minimyth. I use mythtv 0.22 on 8.04.2 LTS
2009-05-24T10:53:00.000Z	blz	losher	 it's the only thing that's changed (besides version-to-version stuff) so maybe.  Losher, was that you who used the raid1/5 or tzanger?
2009-05-24T10:54:00.000Z	losher	blz	zeromod: oops. Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.00GHz
2009-05-24T11:02:00.000Z	losher	blz	before you get busy with raid, why not try a plain old ext3 filesystem and see if the stuttering goes away first?
2009-05-24T11:04:00.000Z	losher	blz	sounds like a lot of work just to record some TV....
