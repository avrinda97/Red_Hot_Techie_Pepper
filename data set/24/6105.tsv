2007-07-23T13:54:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn		wow i am seriously impressed with the new ubuntu
2007-07-23T13:55:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn		big difference from the 5.04 version
2007-07-23T13:55:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn		am i able to burn a cd while in live mode with the new version?
2007-07-23T13:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	should be fine if you already have the iso on some sort of local storage
2007-07-23T13:57:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	well i burned the cd from another computer so only thing this system sees is the live cd.. but i cant copy my files from this hard drive to a network pc so i want to burn everything i have on it before i install ubuntu fully
2007-07-23T13:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	if you only have one drive and the livecd is using it, then no, you can't burn anything
2007-07-23T13:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	and why can't you move the files to a network share?
2007-07-23T13:59:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	something to do with the way the other system is setup i dunno.. i enabled file and print sharing on the other pc and shared a folder but when i browse to that pc from linux i get contents cant be shown
2007-07-23T13:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	what operating system is the other computer running?
2007-07-23T13:59:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	xp  i can see the system just cant access it
2007-07-23T14:00:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	i just dont want to lose the photoshop work i have done on this pc when it was xp.. and i have way too much to upload to some site
2007-07-23T14:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	take the hdd out and connect it to the other computer, or work out how to get your windows file sharing working
2007-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	is there a way i can install ubuntu at the end of the hard drive and leave the file system intack? that way i can burn the stuff i need and then reinstall ubuntu afterwards to take up the entire drive?
2007-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	sure, resize the partition and then install ubuntu in the empty space
2007-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	ok how do i resize the partition?
2007-07-23T14:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	I believe the ubuntu installer can do that
2007-07-23T14:03:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	the ntfs filesystem is only using roughly 100 gigs of the 250 gig.. but its all one drive with no partitions split off it
2007-07-23T14:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	so resize it
2007-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	ok i will try that and see what happens.. hopefully i dont screw it up and lose everything lol
2007-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	dystopianray	ty
2007-07-23T14:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	you could even temporarily connect another burner to the computer
2007-07-23T14:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	or install samba in the livecd environment and get xp to copy files off a share
2007-09-18T13:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-09-18T13:30:00.000Z	dystopianray	wckdkl0wn	no you don't
