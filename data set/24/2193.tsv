2010-03-14T17:16:00.000Z	zetheroo		what can cause a sudo password to no longer work?
2010-03-14T17:16:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	lack of privilidges or incorrect syntax
2010-03-14T17:17:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	lack of priviledges?
2010-03-14T17:20:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	means not allowed to, can you paste what you are trying, explain what you think would happen and show what happened instead
2010-03-14T17:20:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	it's happened to someone I am trying to help over skype chat
2010-03-14T17:21:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	they are trying to update (sudo apt-get update)
2010-03-14T17:26:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	looks like it worked this time ... :P ...
2010-03-14T17:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	sorry no ... bad call ...
2010-03-15T04:39:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	false?
2010-03-15T04:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	2 people here ... using Karmic ... never get notified of available updates
2010-03-15T04:40:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	there are some patches to fix problems, but not new software versions if thats what you meant
2010-03-15T04:40:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	check software sources if its set to periodically check for updates, and that the mirror these are fetched from work
2010-03-15T04:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	all checked and all good to go
2010-03-15T04:41:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	try apt-get update && apt-get upgrade in a console
2010-03-15T04:41:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	oh with the sudo
2010-03-15T04:42:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	that is not the issue ... updates come in when you manually request them ... the issue is with being notified that there are avaialble updates automatically
2010-03-15T04:43:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	im checking to see if its not fetching updates
2010-03-15T04:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	Update Manager works when it's manually triggered to fetch updates ... that is fine ... but I have never gotten a notification telling me that updates are available ... as I did in previous releases of Ubuntu
2010-03-15T04:47:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	is it set to automatically install updates?
2010-03-15T04:47:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	does running apt-get upgrade result in packages being suggested for installation?
2010-03-15T04:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	it is set to check daily for updates and to notify about available updates
2010-05-20T18:43:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	depends, you can set fan speed and automatic fan speed controls in the bios, and/or use the fanspeed program to adjust the fan speed. Id recommend the bios route though, fancontrol isnt very user friendly
2010-05-20T18:44:00.000Z	zetheroo	acicula	I don't think the BIOS fan options are doing the trick :(
2012-08-16T14:50:00.000Z	acicula	zetheroo	when do you notice the difference
