2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	well you could use the equalizer of your mp3 player
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	like in audacious or beep-media-player there is a fader on the very left of your equalizer which you can put up
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	would that work with volume with say, WINE programs?
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	it's the gain fader
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	no
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	yea i don't need it for mp3's
2008-04-29T05:03:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	then no idea bro :)
2008-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	i need it for total volume
2008-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	get a bigger amp :)
2008-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	where does the mixer store the volume settings, it's got to be some kind of number somewhere like e.g. 200 for full volume,  Maybe I can hack it and put it to 250
2008-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	well i got speakers that are 120cm in height here so i can't complain about max levels for sure :)
2008-04-29T05:04:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	against recommened settings
2008-04-29T05:05:00.000Z	deathmask		hmmm
2008-04-29T05:05:00.000Z	nikitis	deathmask	 you can do anything in linux, your telling me this isn't possible?
2008-04-29T05:05:00.000Z	deathmask	nikitis	i don't think you can hack it, it will be somewhere in /proc or directly on the hardware mixer i think, again, check your mixer app to display ALL output faders and double check those, especially master/pcm/wav
