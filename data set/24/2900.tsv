2008-07-02T21:38:00.000Z	Master9		how do i add an ethernet card
2008-07-02T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	generally, if the card is supported, it should be detected automatically at boot.
2008-07-02T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	or do you mean to ask how you should configure the card once it's working?
2008-07-02T21:40:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	it was working, i added a second ethernet card, but it didn't work so i removed it, then my old ethernet card didn't work
2008-07-02T21:40:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	could you pastebin the output of "/sbin/ifconfig"?
2008-07-02T21:41:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	and also, if you could, the contents of the file /etc/network/interfaces
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	sipior		i tend to agree :-)
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	id have to type it all manually, its on a different comp
2008-07-02T21:43:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	in that case, just look to see if any interfaces are currently running, with ip addresses assigned. see if they match the entry in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-07-02T21:43:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	 /etc/network/interfaces is empty, ifconfig shows lo and sit0
2008-07-02T21:43:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	empty? that isn't right...
2008-07-02T21:44:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	do you happen to remember the ethernet device your old card had before?
2008-07-02T21:45:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	 eth0, the card doesn't show up in lspci either
2008-07-02T21:45:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	are you sure the card is seated properly?
2008-07-02T21:46:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	checked many times, also, /etc/iftab doesn't exist
2008-07-02T21:46:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	might consider booting with the ubuntu live cd, to see the original install would still work
2008-07-02T21:47:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	ill remove the card and insert it into a different slot, see if that does anything, otherwise i think my trusty 15 yo 3com card finally died
2008-07-02T21:48:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	yep, but be sure to try the live cd as well, before writing the card off. still, 15 years, the card didn't owe you anything :-)
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	weeeeeee, i believe it works not
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	Master9		(now
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	Master9		*now
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	what'd you do to fix it?
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	Master9	sipior	put it in a different pci slot
2008-07-02T21:53:00.000Z	sipior	Master9	awesome, glad it's working for you
