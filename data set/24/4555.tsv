2007-06-12T07:01:00.000Z	Ashbringer		Alright, I am at my wits end. How can I mount an hfs+ file system read-write? I was just doing it a few hours ago with libhfsp but now that isn't working for some reason. Does anyone have a stable solution?
2007-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	disable journaling in OS X - use disk utility
2007-06-12T07:02:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	I'm in ubuntu, and I dont' have OS X. I just need to mount this external HDD that happens to be formatted hfsplus. I JUST had it working, and I'm doing the exact same commands and it isn't going for some reason.
2007-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	dunno - if it's formatted w/journaling, you probably need OS X to disable it
2007-06-12T07:04:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	I had it working, I had just installed libhfsp0 and libhfsp-dev, but then I unmounted and suspended and now it isn't working
2007-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	may be one of those "reboot, unplug, and try again" issues...
2007-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	the "wits end" part is the me doing that about ten times
2007-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	with staggered uninstalling and purging of those libraries and reinstalling them
2007-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	changed anything with your configuration since you were able to do it?
2007-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	Also, you may try using the live CD, in case something is borked up with your install's hfsplus support
2007-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	no, nothing, hell, my mtab file even says rw on it
2007-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	I've also uninstalled and intalled all of the hfs support packages again and again
2007-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	I dunno, other than the possibility that journaling somehow became enabled on said disk at some point in time - or your install is somehow mysteriously borked up
2007-06-12T07:09:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	This was literally in the space of an hour, where I was working on the drive, unmounted, suspended my laptop, and then tried to remount and it failed
2007-06-12T07:11:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	dunno what's going on, HFS+ can be finicky
2007-06-12T07:12:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	damn right. I hate wrestling with it, I've never gotten it completely down
2007-06-12T07:13:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	try the live CD just to try and get it going - and try using it on a Mac (if you can find one) to check the journaling setting
2007-06-12T07:13:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	there can't be journaling on it, I was JUST using it and it hadn't been plugged into anything except ubuntu
2007-06-12T07:14:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	OK, I'm guessing the filesystem somehow got corrupted
2007-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	filesystem is fine, I can see all of the data on there, its just mounted read-only
2007-06-12T07:15:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	unfortunately, only Mac OS X has HFS+ disk repair tools
2007-06-12T07:16:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	I've heard of things like this happening on HFS+ before, and often the only solution is to run Disk utility on a Mac - even if the problem developed when using Linux
2007-06-12T07:16:00.000Z	Ashbringer	thully	sh*t, alright. Will my data be there?
2007-06-12T07:17:00.000Z	thully	Ashbringer	Should be
