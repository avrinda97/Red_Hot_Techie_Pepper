2006-09-07T15:55:00.000Z	magnet		you have to set up a PXE server

2006-09-07T15:56:00.000Z	magnet	gre1_ON_WINDOES	you need another computer on which you'll set up a PXE server, so you need at least two computers
2006-09-07T15:56:00.000Z	magnet		(the server, and the one you're installing ubuntu on)
2006-09-07T15:56:00.000Z	gre1_ON_WINDOES		ugh

2006-09-07T15:58:00.000Z	magnet		hehe :)
2006-09-07T15:59:00.000Z	magnet	gre1_ON_WINDOES	try to get your hands on a CD drive and install ubuntu the standard way, that will be a lot easier
