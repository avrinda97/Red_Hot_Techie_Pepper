2007-12-22T04:43:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	Malachi	you see when i plugged in my 42 inch LCD it resized my desktop to put it on the screen
2007-12-22T04:44:00.000Z	Malachi		kid_chaos: You could ask someone else who knows more than me. :|
2007-12-22T04:44:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	Malachi	i tried to get my screen resolution huge because the 42 should handle it but no go
2007-12-22T04:45:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS		i couldn't find the brand in the monitor model list in ubuntu
2007-12-22T04:45:00.000Z	Malachi		kid_chaos: If you want, you could open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" to reset everything.
2007-12-22T04:46:00.000Z	KiD_ChAoS	Malachi	that would reset the screen to out-of-box default?
