2006-11-15T13:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	variant	aiglx isn't in the repository either?
2007-01-28T15:01:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	thats not what he needs at all..
2007-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	variant	that's how you upgrade O.o
2007-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	he want's to upgrade a single application
2007-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	variant	then it would just be sudo apt-get update | sudo apt-get install vncviewer
2007-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	anyway, dist-upgrade is for going from one release to annother
2007-01-28T15:03:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	correct, unless there is a version he wants thats not in apt
2007-01-28T15:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	variant	dist-upgrade is not just for going from one release to another, it upgrades all your packages to whatever is the most current in your repos for your release, i use it quite often.
2007-01-28T15:04:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	apt-get upgrade is for that..
2007-01-28T15:05:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	if you don't add new repos (for say edgy instead of dapper) then dist-upgrade and upgrade do the same thing though
2007-01-28T15:06:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	no, i don't
2007-01-28T15:07:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	you don't pipe the commands together.. that will fail
2007-01-28T15:07:00.000Z	bluefox83	variant	i've never had a problem with it
2007-01-28T15:07:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	command ; command will only run the second command if the first one is successfull
2007-01-28T15:08:00.000Z	variant	bluefox83	| pipes the output from one command to annother.. which is clearly not the right thing to do with apt
