2011-11-01T18:03:00.000Z	SrPx		hmm
2011-11-01T18:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	you can consider geany, i think it has code-folding
2011-11-01T18:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	you want gvim probably
2011-11-01T18:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	it has a gui, it doesn't run in the terminal
2011-11-01T18:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	it'll have an icon that you can click, in the applications
2011-11-01T18:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	the interface is similar though
2011-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	SrPx	tensorpudding	iceroot no, but i mean... without gvim it has no gui? so what does it do at all? are there people developing using the shell? you do?
2011-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	some people do
2011-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	you don't have to
2011-11-01T18:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	having both is useful, because you can use shell vim over an ssh session
2011-11-01T18:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	so you can use it to do remote admin
2011-11-01T18:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	the power of vim is overstated, i recommend using geany
2011-11-01T18:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	or probably better, try several things and pick the one that you like most
2011-11-01T18:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	real development is easier with emacs than vim
2011-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	you asked about code folding, i doubt that vim supports it, and it surely wouldn't support it in the shell
2011-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	geany would be the most logical first though, since it's less of a stretch
2011-11-01T18:20:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	just go geany, it's simpler and iirc is available by default
2011-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	take what they say with a big grain of salt
2011-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	SrPx	tensorpudding	pardon?
2011-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	regarding vim being "the most powerful"
2011-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	editor advocacy is a contentious are
2011-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	if you are really going to try vim, you should try emacs too
2011-11-01T18:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding	SrPx	i regretted not trying emacs and saving myself the trouble of learning vim
2011-11-01T18:32:00.000Z	SrPx	tensorpudding	of course ill try the 3 mentioned here
