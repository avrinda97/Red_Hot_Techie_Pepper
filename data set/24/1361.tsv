2010-03-08T10:48:00.000Z	Andorin		So it appears that when I view an image with the Image Viewer app, a small thumbnail of the image is generated in ~/.thumbnails/normal. In Nautilus I have it set to never generate thumbnails, and list view by default. How do I turn off whatever it is that's generating and saving these thumbs?
2010-03-08T10:49:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	that is a gconf-editor app... can also be done in the graphical interface...
2010-03-08T10:51:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	in the folder view open up home folder and change preferences...
2010-03-08T10:51:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	I did. I'm looking right now at apps --> eog in gconf-editor and looking for an option that has to do with ~/.thumbnails/normal.
2010-03-08T10:52:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	no no it hold on.... that was just away to point you in direction that has to do with nautlics... not the apps..
2010-03-08T10:53:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	I did say that I'd already gone through Nautilus's preferences... I think it's only doing this when I open an image with eog, whereas it used to cache a thumbnail for every image that Nautilus previewed while in icon mode.
2010-03-08T10:55:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	in the folder view or image view area... not sure which one your getting at???
2010-03-08T10:57:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	I'm not sure what you mean, so I'll kind of start over... when I open an image with Eye of Gnome, it saves a thumbnail of that image in ~/.thumbnails/normal. As far as I can tell, this has nothing to do with Nautilus, because I have thumbnail caching disabled in Nautilus.
2010-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	nothing in eog stating saving thumbnails using gconf editor..??? hold on I will look around... at file set up...
2010-03-08T10:59:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	Nope, I don't see any options.
2010-03-08T11:00:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	I agree, what is the big deal with this option I have the same thumbnails folder as well??
2010-03-08T11:01:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	the size is only 8.3 kbs... not much drive space being eaten...
2010-03-08T11:01:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	It's just something I want to maintain control over.
2010-03-08T11:02:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	appears most of these thumbnails are used for my desktop settings...
2010-03-08T11:03:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	It also generates a thumb if you open an image from, say, ~/Pictures/
2010-03-08T11:04:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	understand... just not sure your going to be able to stop this idea... most of the pictures you use for backgroud that is the thumbnail it is producing...
2010-03-08T11:05:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	Yeah, that's the conclusion I'm coming to as well.
2010-03-08T11:07:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	the size is not greater then 20 kbs not sure it is even worth messing with...
2010-03-08T11:08:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	I suppose. Thanks for your help :)
2010-03-08T11:10:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	found thumbnailer under gconf-editor under shceme gnome thumbnailer...
2010-03-08T11:11:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	there it is
2010-03-08T11:13:00.000Z	Andorin	DebiansArmy	Good find, but it's still generating thumbs for me when I open an image.
2010-03-08T11:13:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	under Desktop> Gnome> there is thumbnailer > it allows you to disable all not sure what this does though???
2010-03-08T11:16:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	Andorin	well played with the idea enough have to wash dishes and vaccum later good luck... :)
