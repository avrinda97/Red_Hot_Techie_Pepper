2012-01-19T15:33:00.000Z	kevin_		Xubuntu
2012-01-19T15:33:00.000Z	kevin_		Yes.
2012-01-19T15:35:00.000Z	kevin_		Okay, installed, now I should be able to run the game?
2012-01-19T15:35:00.000Z	kevin_		Also yes, the programmers of the game are very lazy bastards. xD
2012-01-19T15:35:00.000Z	kevin_		No, it's a game I've played for years and years. More or less a chat client these days
2012-01-19T15:36:00.000Z	kevin_		Nope, one second.

2012-01-19T15:38:00.000Z	kevin_		The people that made the game I'm talking about
2012-01-19T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	do you have an ubuntu issue ?
2012-01-19T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	what happens on windows has no relevence to ubuntu,
2012-01-19T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	do you have an ubuntu issue you need help with
2012-01-19T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	you won't need "drivers" for intel cards
2012-01-19T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	they are part of xorg
2012-01-19T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	you need to configure xorg to be able to utilise the 3d capabilities of your card, if it's a supported card
2012-01-19T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	you'll probably need to create a custom xorg.conf file to force xorg to use the correct graphics driver in xorg and enable 3D support
2012-01-19T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	that is assuming that card is supported in linux
2012-01-19T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	the card should be, most intel ones are support
2012-01-19T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	it's making perfect sense
2012-01-19T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	within linux your video card does not auto configure to use it's 3d capabilities
2012-01-19T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	that means you have to manually configure it, providing the card has 3d support options for linux
2012-01-19T15:59:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	not all cards have support/compatability in Linux
2012-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	ikonia	kevin_	tone down the langauge
