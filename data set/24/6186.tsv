2006-12-10T16:29:00.000Z	mc__		how to remove a package when  even dpkg --force-all --purge refuses to work?
2006-12-10T16:30:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	it's not proberly installed?
2006-12-10T16:31:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	nope it is not correctly installed,it fails configuring
2006-12-10T16:32:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	then only way I know of fixing that if you can't properly install it is manually removing it from the status file.
2006-12-10T16:33:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	how would i do tahat?
2006-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	well first read this "Do it on your own risk!"
2006-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	usually it's safe if you backup first though
2006-12-10T16:34:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	alright
2006-12-10T16:35:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	well open a terminal. then cd /var/lib/dpkg. the sudo cp status status.backup to backup the status file
2006-12-10T16:36:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	and then?
2006-12-10T16:36:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	you backed up the status file? ls confirms it?
2006-12-10T16:36:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	yes
2006-12-10T16:37:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	the package im trying to remove is called k3d
2006-12-10T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	ok. sudo nano status. then you'll see that each package has a section of about 20 lines and each section is seperated by a blank line. locate the section for you package and remove that section and save the file
2006-12-10T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	then apt will think it was never installed
2006-12-10T16:38:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	has that section a fixed lenght?
2006-12-10T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	if apt then works ok, good. if not restore the old status file and try something else
2006-12-10T16:39:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	it varies. some 20 lines usually. you can tell by the blank lines
2006-12-10T16:39:00.000Z	mc__	mwe	alright,i'll try,thank you!
2006-12-10T16:39:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	use the search function to locate the right section
2006-12-10T16:42:00.000Z	mwe	mc__	doing what I suggested, you'll have to manually remove any files the package might have installed, though.
