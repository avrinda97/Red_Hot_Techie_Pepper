2006-11-29T08:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	easysource will help you construct one
2006-11-29T08:02:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	I am aware, I would just like to see a default sources.list
2006-11-29T08:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	Ah - Well, it has the deb and deb-src lines for main restricted, regular, security, and updates.  I think that's it.
2006-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	I was actually trying to read it first but it was going to fast
2006-12-20T10:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	ah
2006-12-20T10:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	Frankly, even if there's just that many users you join in quick succession, I'd recommend typing it out and just waiting on the <Enter> - maybe drop us a line in #ubuntu-ops too - but wait on hitting it a moment, and of course that doesn't apply to netsplit rejoins.
2007-01-26T09:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	courtesy of yours truly.  Trying to get the language in this channel under control.
2007-02-01T10:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	Or just search at the page :)
2007-03-23T16:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	^^
2007-03-23T07:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	There are women here - they're just wise enough not to let people know.
2007-03-23T07:39:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	a few
2007-04-19T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	what I was going for
2007-06-25T12:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	that doesn't factor in any non-individual deployments
2007-06-25T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	that list is underwhelming, at least at the top, the first two have no real impact on end user, except I guess the first one if it prints out more meaningful errors so people can understand it, the next one no impact, free flash won't happen by gutsy
2007-08-17T08:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	kind of - it's remarkably relevant from time to time (and I'd link it here if it was written by someone else too :P )
2007-11-03T07:33:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	3rd link is a charm?
2007-11-03T07:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	clearly :)
2007-11-03T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	tonyyarusso	...^
2008-11-23T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	There's a PPA for it
2008-11-23T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openoffice-pkgs/ubuntu intrepid main
2008-11-23T12:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	sleep should be available by default - no need to install anything.
2008-11-23T12:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bruenig	/bin/sleep
