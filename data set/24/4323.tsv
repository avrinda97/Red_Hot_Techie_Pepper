2007-05-07T06:36:00.000Z	infignus		so someone help me??
2007-05-07T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 we'd love to help but we might not know how ,  give us a bit of time to think about it
2007-05-07T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 that's not helping,  the only thing you are doing is annyoing ppl
2007-05-07T06:38:00.000Z	infignus	Pelo	Pelo: program that i click, and he cheack my disk
2007-05-07T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 did the ubuntu live cd mount your hdd ?
2007-05-07T06:39:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 try this,    menu > system > admin > gparted ( gnome partition manager) , make sure the first partition on your hdd is flagged Boot
2007-05-07T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 once you have done that,  reboot your computer without the live cd
2007-05-07T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 I am betting that you can'T boot your computer because the hdd is not flagged,   that's my first guess,  if that did work,  just try a Windows repair install before doing anything else
2007-05-07T06:43:00.000Z	infignus	Pelo	  I think my disk have badsectors, or smth and i must cheak it. I need program that say me: Your disk is healthy
2007-05-07T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 this a a disk with windows installed on it ?   boot up the windows cd ,  do not install , you'll get a prompt  ,  run  chkdsk c:
2007-05-07T06:45:00.000Z	infignus	Pelo	i dant have partitions on it. Is unalocated free space. I erase all partitions.
2007-05-07T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 well then,  use gparted to make a new lable and set new partitions
2007-05-07T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 no but it will make new partitions
2007-05-07T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 you want to install ubuntu ?  just run the install and let it take care of it ,
2007-05-07T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 ubuntu will format your disk when it installs, if here is something wrong it will tell you
2007-05-07T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	 you might get more help about dsk checks and stuff in  ##linux
2007-05-07T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	infignus	I don'T know I've never run into a hdd problem in linux yet so I haven'T had to find out,  and the older helpers don't seem to be around right now
