2007-09-30T11:55:00.000Z	caravel		help! I'd like to configure Feisty so that all users, current and future, can access m$ network shares over nautilus. Do I need fusesmb, is there a multi user tutorial anywhere ?
2007-09-30T11:55:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	its already set up that way
2007-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	they just go to places -> network
2007-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	rockets		!patience | amio
2007-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	thanks for your answer -- doesn't work for me. smbclient works, but the "Windows Network" area remains empty
2007-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	well then . . . you could use fusesmb and mount them all in folders
2007-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	in directories rather
2007-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	I'd rather to fix the setup, can anyone help ?
2007-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	make sure everybody is in the same workgroup?
2007-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	arrrgh -- are we still under these stupid constraints ? :)
2007-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	lol guess so
2007-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	rockets		!patience | amio
2007-09-30T11:59:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	luckily i operate in an almost entirely windows-free environment
2007-09-30T11:59:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	everything here is NFS or iSCSI
2007-09-30T11:59:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	I'm jealous ! okay, where is the workgroup config in feisty (is there a GUI for it ?) sorry for the dummy question, but didn't find the info in tuto ..
2007-09-30T12:00:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	system -> administration -> shared folders
2007-09-30T12:00:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	somewhere in there
2007-09-30T12:01:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	SHAME ON ME! thanks, seeya around
2007-09-30T12:01:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	heh
2007-09-30T12:03:00.000Z	rockets		Can I browse NFS shares with nautilus?
2007-09-30T12:04:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	I blamed myself too fast :) like I said, smbclient worked while my client and server had distinct workgroup names (do I need to restart anything after cganging workgroup ?)
2007-09-30T12:04:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	idk man.
2007-09-30T12:04:00.000Z	rockets	caravel	theres something specific to your network going on
2007-09-30T12:06:00.000Z	caravel	rockets	it's a basic home network and it's /not/ mine :) 2 m$ clients running XP in a MSHOME workgroup, and my smbclient works so I'd think the problem is on my feisty right?
