2009-11-28T12:24:00.000Z	racecar56		for some odd reason i think my BIOS settings are the problem, let me check them.

2009-11-28T12:30:00.000Z	bbB	Reactor	 Ubutu is very user friendly, and what should I fix it for learning.
2009-11-28T12:34:00.000Z	racecar56		apparently, it WAS the BIOS settings after all
2009-11-28T12:34:00.000Z	racecar56		but there's a new problem, I can't ping the other computer through firewire..
2009-11-28T12:34:00.000Z	racecar56		they are both using linux, i configured their IPs and stuff right.
2009-11-28T12:35:00.000Z	bbB	Reactor	For general using, Ubuntu is very simply to use, but I want to know more, and can you suggest me?
2009-11-28T12:35:00.000Z	racecar56		computer 1's IP is 10.0.0.1 and the 2nd computer's IP is 10.0.0.2 and the 2nd computer's gateway is 10.0.0.1, they both have same netmask and broadcast addresses.
2009-11-28T12:36:00.000Z	racecar56		i don't want to use ethernet to transfer because it is only 10mbps :( i don't know why
2009-11-28T12:40:00.000Z	bbB	Reactor	I recognize that, file system is what I want to know.

2009-11-28T12:50:00.000Z	racecar56		i'm trying to do it but i can't seem to get it working
