2004-08-23T15:31:00.000Z	Keybuk		not too long then
2004-08-23T15:32:00.000Z	Keybuk		check if my house is on fire on the way through -- it's by the trainline on the way out
2004-08-23T15:32:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	we need depends in init scripts :p
2004-08-28T15:16:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	bonjour, a va?
2004-08-28T15:16:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	trs bien merci :) Et toi ? On parle franais aujourd'hui ? :)
2004-08-28T16:27:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	yeah schemas in /etc is a bad idea, will be fixed but not for warty
2004-09-12T11:12:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	oi, bitch! :p
2004-09-12T11:46:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	weird, needed to nuke ~/.gnome2/session to get my icons and cursor theme again
2004-09-12T11:47:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	have you kept the faulty one ?
2004-09-12T11:50:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	/usr/share/control-center-2.0/capplets/vino-properties.desktop has Icon=gnome-remote-desktop.png
2004-09-12T11:58:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	have you started the session with gdm ?
2004-09-14T10:53:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	gtkhtml3.2 conflicts with gtkhtml3.1
2004-09-15T10:56:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	are you really sure you've fixed the gnome-settings-daemon problem?  nautilus is currently refusing to respond to a background change notification
2004-09-15T11:40:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	which problem ?
2004-09-15T11:44:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	well, nautilus wasn't reacting to any changes in the background (from the properties) dialog until it was killed and respawned
2004-09-15T11:45:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	it was supposed to be fixed ?
2004-09-15T11:50:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	and I can't change icon theme either ... nothing happens when I change the selection
2004-09-15T11:51:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	yeah, the theme manager is fucked sometimes. I've already talked with some redhat guys about this, they have the problem too but no real idea of the problem
2004-09-15T11:51:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	control-center has virtually no upstream for some months now ...
2004-09-25T15:10:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	yeah, I don't think your canonical.com is working
2004-09-25T15:11:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	but I get ACCEPTED mail
2005-01-18T09:31:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	yeah, too late for gnome upstream; we could still include it though :)
2005-01-18T09:31:00.000Z	Keybuk	seb128	yeah
2005-01-18T09:32:00.000Z	seb128	Keybuk	could be nice to get :)
