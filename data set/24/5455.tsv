2007-06-27T16:33:00.000Z	jareth_		guys, i need help. after installing feisty, there is no entry for xp on one of me four sata disks...
2007-06-27T16:35:00.000Z	jareth_		xp is installed on sda1
2007-06-27T16:35:00.000Z	jareth_		how do i create grub entry for that
2007-06-27T16:35:00.000Z	jareth_		?
2007-06-27T16:36:00.000Z	clem	jareth_	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst .. there's a windows example commented out in there.
2007-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	jareth_	clem	what will my root for xp be? /dev/sda1
2007-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	clem	jareth_	should be /dev/sda1
2007-06-27T16:38:00.000Z	clem	jareth_	hold on..
2007-06-27T16:38:00.000Z	clem	jareth_	sorry ... root should be (hd0,0)
2007-06-27T16:39:00.000Z	jareth_	clem	sure?
2007-06-27T16:39:00.000Z	clem	jareth_	/dev/sda1 might also work... it's basically the same, hd0,0 is grub syntax.. /dev/sda1 is the way linux sees it.
