2008-03-03T23:34:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	you can always try 'mv .mozilla old.mozilla` from your home directory and restart firefox .. don't know what else to do
2008-03-03T23:59:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	and you moved the .mozilla folder ?

2008-03-04T00:00:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	for grins and giggles .. open up a terminal and do ... mv .mozilla old.mozilla
2008-03-04T00:01:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	restart firefox

2008-03-04T00:06:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	your configurations and settings and cache are stored in a directory named '.mozilla' .. when you removed it .. it was like re-setting your settings :)

2008-03-04T00:10:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	now you now .. and if you do `ls -a` you can see all your . files :)
2008-03-04T00:10:00.000Z	SimplySeth	jescis	files/folders that begin with a dot are hidden unless you do ls -a
