2009-12-06T09:18:00.000Z	Snausages	coop3r	unetbootin is a tool which sets that up for you
2009-12-06T09:19:00.000Z	Snausages	coop3r	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2009-12-06T09:19:00.000Z	coop3r		does it work with windows
2009-12-06T09:19:00.000Z	Snausages		claims to, never tried myself
2009-12-06T09:19:00.000Z	coop3r		thanks Snausages =)
2009-12-06T09:24:00.000Z	coop3r	Snausages	i need some more help
2009-12-06T09:25:00.000Z	coop3r		i downloaded that and i chose Type: Hark disk and Drive: it only has C when the H drive is what i want to install it to Snausages
2009-12-06T09:25:00.000Z	coop3r		:/
2009-12-06T09:26:00.000Z	Snausages	coop3r	possibly an issue with the formatting or partition scheme in use on that external?  I've never used it, but those are common issues for bootability in general.
2009-12-06T09:26:00.000Z	coop3r	Snausages	the drive is working for everything else
2009-12-06T09:26:00.000Z	coop3r		:/
2009-12-06T09:27:00.000Z	Snausages	coop3r	yes, it would even with a partition scheme problem or incorrect format.  See if there's any documentation with that app, or google for unetbootin howto
2009-12-06T09:27:00.000Z	coop3r		ok
2009-12-06T09:29:00.000Z	coop3r	Snausages	will this erase everything on my external?
