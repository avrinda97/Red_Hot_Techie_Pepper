2005-10-27T07:56:00.000Z	Marelo		can anyone tell me if "emule" (or amule, xmule) is on the ubuntu repository?
2005-10-27T07:58:00.000Z	Marelo		oops
2005-10-27T07:58:00.000Z	Marelo		i always used gaim on linux, also
2005-10-27T07:59:00.000Z	Marelo		there used to be a 'kopete', but i think it's discontinued
2005-10-27T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo		^^
2005-10-27T08:02:00.000Z	Marelo		icemilo... yeap... sorry
2005-10-27T08:04:00.000Z	Marelo		hey guys, i'm actually a begginer at linux world, so, i still have many things, espcially my personal files under windows (ntfs)... how can i easily migrate then? or is there a way to tell linux to work with the ntfs?

2005-10-27T08:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	you should copy the files into your Linux filesystem from NTFS.  You can't write to NTFS safely from Linux
2005-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	so, it's just ctrl c / ctrl v?
2005-10-27T08:09:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	I would use the command line.  I don't know how good a job nautilus would make of it.
2005-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	the sad thing is that I would have to copy gig's and gig's of files...
2005-10-27T08:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	that's ok - it'll take a while, but you can wait, right?
2005-10-27T08:11:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	 hehehe sure i can wait, i just don't have the FREE SPACE needed hehehehe
2005-10-27T08:11:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	aah.  I see.
2005-10-27T08:11:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	can you back the files up, then reformat the NTFS partition to ext3 or something, then restore them?
2005-10-27T08:13:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	i think i could... but the thing is that my family (and me too, won't lie) still uses windows, especially my family (users...) so i can just "blow everything"
2005-10-27T08:13:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	ergo... i wanted a smarter solution... when will linux work fine with ntfs?? :(
2005-10-27T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	rumour has it that "captive NTFS" works well, using the Windows NTFS driver.  But I don't know for sure.
2005-10-27T08:14:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	where can i read more about this captive?
2005-10-27T08:14:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	google it
2005-10-27T08:15:00.000Z	Marelo	dooglus	hehe sure. great old uncle google
2005-10-27T08:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Marelo	yes, that's the one.
