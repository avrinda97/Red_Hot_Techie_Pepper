2008-12-11T10:03:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	nexus23: there's no need to sudo that command
2008-12-11T10:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	oh, roger
2010-05-19T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	find the right place on the wiki for it
2010-05-19T02:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	for installing x-cursor-themes?
2010-05-19T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	yes
2010-05-19T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	help.ubuntu.com/community
2010-05-19T02:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	roger. i'm offering to help install them if anyone wants
2010-05-19T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	I understand, but that's a bit counter-productive
2010-05-19T02:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	ok, roger
2010-05-19T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	once you have it up on the wiki, you can create a factoid in ubottu too if you want
2010-05-19T02:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	ok. i 'might' do that. however, getting an x-cursor-theme installed from a .targ.z from www.gnome-look.org is... pretty complex
2010-05-19T02:16:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	the factoid would just link to the wiki page
2010-05-19T02:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	roger
2010-05-19T02:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	i mean.. even making a tutorial on the wiki.. it would be a lot of steps
2010-05-19T02:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	i might do it. but i would worry a little that if someone weren't walking them through it, they'd have trouble and frustration.
2010-05-19T02:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	i think perhaps what i should do, if anything further, is learn how to package them, like the 'crystalcursors' package ;-)
2010-05-19T02:23:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	in the past, if the cursor theme was packaged correctly, I thought you could just drag the theme into the Appearance -> Icons window.  Is that no longer the case?
2010-05-19T02:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	correct.. that no longer seems to work. at least not for 2 different x-cursor themes downloaded as a .tar.gz that i helped people get installed... Obsidian, and aero-drop
2010-05-19T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	or maybe confnew in this case
2010-05-19T05:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	yep.. i think confnew
2010-05-19T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	--force-confmiss, no?
2010-05-19T05:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	hmm, let me look! :-)
2010-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	onetinsoldier	by default, yeah
2010-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jrib	roger. thank you
