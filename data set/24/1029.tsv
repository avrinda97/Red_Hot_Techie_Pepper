2010-08-31T22:40:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	nope, sorry. :(
2010-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	I just need a tip what to change to get grub working, since it is installed and everything...
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	there is a command grub-install or grub-setup, can't remember exactly which one. it detects your OS' and adds them to the config
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	the menu.lst is right, I checked it
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	all my OSes are in there
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	and grub starts up when I start the computer, so I can't see where the problem is...
2010-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	are you using grub or grub2?
2010-08-31T22:43:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	Grub2, as it seems (installed with recent ubuntu)
2010-08-31T22:43:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	then menu.lst is no longer needed
2010-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	so I can use update_grub in the grub console?
2010-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	yeah, sometinhg like that
2010-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	I see, I will try that. Thank you.
2010-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	wait
2010-08-31T22:45:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	not in the grub console, but in a regular system
2010-08-31T22:45:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	and then I check the grub.cfg?
2010-08-31T22:45:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	it keeps settings somewhere else. rtfm.
2010-08-31T22:45:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	the wiki says grub.cfg.
2010-08-31T22:46:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	the wiki for grub or grub2?
2010-08-31T22:46:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	grub2
2010-08-31T22:46:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	then perhaps it is so. though the update script should present you with a list of detected OS'
2010-08-31T22:47:00.000Z	janisozaur	CorniMac	this file is not meant to be fiddled with
2010-08-31T22:47:00.000Z	CorniMac	janisozaur	I won't change anything.
