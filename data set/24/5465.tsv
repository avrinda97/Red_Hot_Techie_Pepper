2006-07-10T10:03:00.000Z	ddman		Hello
2006-07-10T10:05:00.000Z	ddman		I installed dc++ package from http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/linuxdcpp on Ubuntu 6.06 and synaptic sys it's broken. Cannot update
2006-07-10T10:05:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	did you try 'fix broken packages' in synaptic?
2006-07-10T10:05:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	try 'apt-get update'. then run synaptic again and try 'fix broken packages'
2006-07-10T10:06:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	thanks
2006-07-10T10:16:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	fix broken packages otion tries to remove the package
2006-07-10T10:17:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	hmm. sorry, dont know what to tell you. uninstall and reinstall?
2006-07-10T10:17:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	or just ignore it.
2006-07-10T10:17:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	how?
2006-07-10T10:18:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	in synaptic you can mark a package for re-installation. give that a shot
2006-07-10T10:20:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	the debian package has dependecies on newer vesion of libraries
2006-07-10T10:25:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	needs help with broken package, dependency. if someone can help him.
2006-07-10T10:25:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	sorry, im still a bit of a newb with apt-get. been using yum for too long ;)
2006-07-10T10:26:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	ok
2006-07-10T10:26:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	whats  the problem with removing it and re-installing afterward. maybe this is what synaptic wants you to do in order to fix it
2006-07-10T10:28:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	why did you do --force when installing?
2006-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	just my .02 but i'd say your better off figuring out a way to install with dpkg or apt-get and satisfy the deps
2006-07-10T10:31:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	by that i mean avoid --force and --nodeps
2006-07-10T10:32:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	why did you have to use --force?
2006-07-10T10:33:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	nosklo, agreed. i think you should try to avoid this
2006-07-10T10:36:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	lol, it can get bad :D
2006-07-10T10:37:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	but hey, the programs running so worse case scenario youll just have to ignore synaptics whines
2006-07-10T10:38:00.000Z	ddman	devhen	synaptic, who needs it?
2006-07-10T10:39:00.000Z	devhen	ddman	:) not me. i stick with apt-get
