2005-08-01T11:57:00.000Z	ZincX		like this high pitched sound .??
2005-08-01T11:58:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	it could be the processor's fan sound?
2005-08-01T11:58:00.000Z	ZincX	Belutz	im not so sure...
2005-08-01T11:58:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	i think it is, because my PC has that noise too
2005-08-01T12:00:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	the graphic's card fan maybe ?
2005-08-01T12:00:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	maybe you should open up your CPU to find the source of the sound
2005-08-01T12:00:00.000Z	ZincX	Belutz	no fan on the graphix card though.. its gigabyte ati .. doesnt produce heat that much
2005-08-01T12:01:00.000Z	ZincX	Belutz	its too high :S really disturbs the ear... cant trace the real source.. why wud i ask ?
2005-08-01T12:02:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	i still curious about the processor's fan... but i donno...
2005-08-01T12:02:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	funny thing like what?
2005-08-01T12:03:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	hmmm then it could be the PSU fan?
2005-08-01T12:04:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	yup, it could be the monitor...
2005-08-01T12:05:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	i think you should check it before anything bad happened
2005-08-01T12:06:00.000Z	ZincX	Belutz	yeah.. maybe the thing mite blow up :S
2005-08-01T12:07:00.000Z	Belutz	ZincX	well hope that didn't happened
