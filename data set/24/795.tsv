2011-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	shifuimam		incidentally, is the Radeon 9800 Pro officially no longer supprted in 10.10?
2011-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	do you know which rXXX sereis it is?
2011-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	r350, IIRC
2011-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	I believe it is supported in the open source radeon drivers
2011-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	well, i had the radeon drivers in use, but i was getting major artifacts pretty much all the time on-screen
2011-01-18T10:05:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	which version? There's bee a LOT of dev on it
2011-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	whatever is the latest in Aptitude
2011-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	probably way out of date - I'm running xorg-edgers + a more recent kernel
2011-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	care to elaborate on that?
2011-01-18T10:07:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	Well this laptop is an evergreen/redwood chipset - which is a new series, so it had no open source support at first
2011-01-18T10:08:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	well, as far as what you did with xorg. linux buddy of mine has indicated that i might have no choice but to use an older version of xorg
2011-01-18T10:08:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	hang on
2011-01-18T10:09:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	AFAIK it's only the ATI propietry dfrivers that have been dropping support for cards
2011-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	if the open source driver had suppport previously then it probably still has it
2011-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	then i'm at a loss as to why it's artifacting all crazy-like
2011-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	But if you go to xorg-edgers / latest kernel, you're riding the bleeding edge, so fair warning
2011-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	hmmmmmmmm
2011-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	just to check, you haven't been trying to use the propietry drivers or anything? If you have it needs to be properly removed before switching to the other one
2011-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	i'm 90% sure i was using the radeon drivers
2011-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	can you pastie your dmesg log?
2011-01-18T10:12:00.000Z	shifuimam	bloopletech	sure, hang on...
2011-01-18T10:18:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	looking
2011-01-18T10:19:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	hmm I see the segfaults ... can you pastie the xorg log as well?
2011-01-18T10:29:00.000Z	bloopletech	shifuimam	you're using / it's trying to use the propietry ATI drivers
