2006-10-26T08:07:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	Please, don't make people do that for software that's IN ubuntu already.
2006-10-26T08:08:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	eva can use apt-get install acroread after enabling multiverse.
2006-10-26T08:08:00.000Z	nikin	cafuego	there where problems with the ubuntu version ...
2006-10-26T08:08:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	such as?
2006-10-26T08:09:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	<heh>
2006-10-26T08:10:00.000Z	nikin	cafuego	i didnt sleep for about 50 hours
2007-08-21T16:20:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	No, it's not. That rule is a workaround for a bug that hasn't existed since kernel 2.4.6
2007-08-21T16:22:00.000Z	nikin	cafuego	i  dont know about that bug.. but i uses these settings for a long time.. and it turned out to be good... what do you suggest?
2007-08-21T16:22:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	Enough to hibernate if needed, otherwise, about the same as ram.
2007-08-21T16:23:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	keep in mind, the more swap you have, the more the machin will trash around and get slow *if* a memory leak forces it to start using all that swap space.
2007-08-21T16:23:00.000Z	nikin	cafuego	bytheway what was that bug? do you have any links on that?
2007-08-21T16:23:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	Well, not so much a bug as a "feature" in the VM subsystem.
2007-08-21T16:25:00.000Z	nikin	cafuego	i understand .. but what if there is a memory leak and no swap? out of memory? or it creates a swap file?
2007-08-21T16:25:00.000Z	cafuego	nikin	The OOM Killer would start killing processes
