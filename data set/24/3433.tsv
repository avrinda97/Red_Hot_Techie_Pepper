2008-12-21T06:08:00.000Z	hey_joe		can anyone tell me why the newest alternate, and desktop cd won't function?  i believe it must be gnome... when i install with the alternate CD, i can login, but then it just hangs on the orange background.. mouse still works, the live CD, won't load the desktop unless in safe graphics mode..
2008-12-21T06:09:00.000Z	hey_joe		what can i do here?
2008-12-21T06:09:00.000Z	hey_joe		i know how to get to a failsafe terminal..
2008-12-21T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	did you md5 check the iso and verify the cd was consistant once burned?
2008-12-21T06:09:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	yes I did indeed.
2008-12-21T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	good, thats one possibility out of the way
2008-12-21T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	you could try disabling things like dma / acpi
2008-12-21T06:10:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	did that as well..
2008-12-21T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	checked ram health and hard drive health?
2008-12-21T06:10:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	yes..
2008-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	disabled unnecessary hardware in bios
2008-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	I do that anyways....  and beside that.. safe graphics DOES work..
2008-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	can you boot to root console and create a new user, see if logging in with that user works ok
2008-12-21T06:11:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	did that too..
2008-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	tried upgrading your system from root console?
2008-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	i did set a root password, login, and do apt-get update
2008-12-21T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	oh dear, enabling the root account is not a good idea
2008-12-21T06:13:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	it doesn't matter, the machine is not connected to the network.. i was just testing..
2008-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	is there a way to update all installed packages with apt-get if I was to connect it to the network?
2008-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	hey_joe	ActionParsnip	did that already as well..
2008-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	will set your xorg to defaults
2008-12-21T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	i'd also add: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-10-05T21:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hey_joe	yes
