2009-09-20T16:46:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		hi all - is it possible to install ubuntu from ubuntu? i.e. install a new version on another partition, from a running ubuntu?
2009-09-20T16:46:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	yes.
2009-09-20T16:46:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	nice :) got a link to a howto?
2009-09-20T16:48:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	got a hint what do google for? i only find stuff for windows.
2009-09-20T16:48:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	would it work to download the iso, mount it and start the installer? what is it called?
2009-09-20T16:49:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	well, that surely would work. But there is a specific tool (from Debian) to do an install from a running filersystem
2009-09-20T16:50:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	check http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Debian/installers.html
2009-09-20T16:52:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	not sure what to look for there.
2009-09-20T16:53:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	when looking at the iso... what would the instalelr be called? and i hope it's a static binary :P
2009-09-20T16:54:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	ahh yes, I'll look a bit more. here it is: http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap
2009-09-20T16:55:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromKnoppix
2009-09-20T16:56:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	the method is the same from ubuntu itself.
2009-09-20T16:57:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	thanks! i would have thought there should be something pre-rolled. would be cool to be able to do it with apt-get :)
2009-09-20T17:03:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	hm... that seems to give me a base system, and i can configrre the rest manually. but really all i want to do is run the normal installer that's also on the cd. much simpler. why would i need to boot fro mthe cd to run the installer?
2009-09-20T17:04:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	nothing special.
2009-09-20T17:04:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	it's annoying that i have to get the full iso though. would be nice to get *just* the installer. actually... is there a small "network install" iso?
2009-09-20T17:05:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	yes.
2009-09-20T17:06:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	Neosano: but but... where?! i must be blind.
2009-09-20T17:21:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	Neosano: doesn't look like i can run the installer from a mounted iso. it's all compressed into initrd.gz
2009-09-20T17:22:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	you can if you boot the ISO.
2009-09-20T17:22:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	or if you run 'deboostrap'.
2009-09-20T17:22:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	i don't *want* to boot the iso, that#s the entiere point :) i want to run the installer off a runing ubuntu :)
2009-09-20T17:23:00.000Z	Walex	Duesentrieb	run it into a virtual machine. Else use 'deboostrap'
2009-09-20T17:23:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	Walex	but debootstrap doesn't run the normal installer. it installs a base system. not what i want.
