2012-06-09T23:13:00.000Z	Datz		drivers aren't being loaded
2012-06-09T23:13:00.000Z	Datz		... how fun.
2012-06-09T23:14:00.000Z	Datz		I feel like I'm using linux in 1993  :P
2012-06-09T23:14:00.000Z	dlentz	Datz	check dmesg to see why
2012-06-09T23:14:00.000Z	Datz		kk
2012-06-09T23:15:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	too much output, what should I filter?
2012-06-09T23:15:00.000Z	dlentz	Datz	you can pastebin it or maybe dmesg | grep -i alsa
2012-06-09T23:16:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	thanks. I'll try alsa first
2012-06-09T23:16:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	[    8.349972] init: alsa-restore main process (906) terminated with status 19
2012-06-09T23:16:00.000Z	Datz		wonder what status 19 is
2012-06-09T23:17:00.000Z	dlentz	Datz	yeah, that's what i thought. wish i knew the solution :\
2012-06-09T23:17:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	d'oh
2012-06-09T23:17:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	last think I did was install audacity... does that mean anything?
2012-06-09T23:17:00.000Z	dlentz		i've seen a lot of bugs with that dmesg line
2012-06-09T23:18:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	interesting. May my mouse problem be related? It doesn't work until I plug it back in.
2012-06-09T23:19:00.000Z	dlentz	Datz	i don't think audacity has anything to do with it, it has something to do with your saved alsa settings not beingrestored
2012-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	I see. Is there a way to revert back to default? ALso, why does alsamixer not run, any ideas?>
2012-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	dlentz		alsamixer won't run because of that bug
2012-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	I see..
2012-06-09T23:21:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	I saved my home directory when I upgraded. might an old alsa directory be the problem?
2012-06-09T23:21:00.000Z	dlentz		bbl
2012-06-09T23:22:00.000Z	Datz		kk
2012-06-09T23:22:00.000Z	dlentz		sorry Datz , real life needs attending :\
2012-06-09T23:52:00.000Z	Datz	dlentz	I think I found the root of the problem. I have a SD card reader. A mico to regular SD card was inserted without an acutall card. Post was taking forever trying to boot. I think it was creating problems with loading drivers too for some reason. Mouse back working, as well as sound.
