2006-07-30T15:14:00.000Z	abo		I added my current user to the ntfs group using the command "usermode -G ntfs" and now there is no sound, can anyone help please?
2006-07-30T15:14:00.000Z	sethk	abo	presumably you mean usermod, not usermode
2006-07-30T15:14:00.000Z	abo	sethk	yes sorry :)
2006-07-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	abo	hard to see how that could cause the sound problem.  with the upper case G it adds you to a new group but does not remove you from any groups, and does not change the default group
2006-07-30T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	abo	I suspect that losing sound at that point is a coincidence and caused by something else.
2006-07-30T15:16:00.000Z	abo	sethk	is there a way I can figure out what happened, I was trying to configure ntfs-fuse, this one made my ntfs disk icons not show on desktop anymore, and the sound to be disabled
2006-07-30T15:17:00.000Z	abo	sethk	It may be as you said, but how can I fix it...? how do I investigate?
2006-07-30T15:17:00.000Z	sethk	abo	is sound completely dead?  can you play a .wav file with the aplay utility?
2006-07-30T15:21:00.000Z	abo	sethk	there was sound before I logged in, sound is completely dead now
2006-07-30T15:21:00.000Z	abo	sethk	aplay give error such as no soundcard found
2006-07-30T15:22:00.000Z	abo	sethk	it says No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found. when I double click on the sound icon
2006-08-31T16:21:00.000Z	sethk	abo	normally by stopping synaptic
2006-08-31T16:21:00.000Z	sethk	abo	do ps aux | grep synaptic    make sure you don't have one running that you don't know about
2006-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	sethk	abo	also make sure apt-get and/or dpkg also is not running
2006-08-31T16:22:00.000Z	abo	sethk	jazzrocker,  ps -aux | grep  apt returns nothing
2006-08-31T16:23:00.000Z	sethk	abo	actually, no, grep -i atp would
2006-08-31T16:24:00.000Z	sethk	abo	the other thing that causes the "can't lock" message is if you don't run as root.   try the command again, but with sudo
2006-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	abo	sethk	l, linux froze and I had to reboot
2006-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	abo	sethk	when I launch synaptic I am prompted to enter my password
2006-08-31T16:25:00.000Z	sethk	abo	you do   sudo synaptic?
2006-08-31T16:27:00.000Z	abo	sethk	yes synaptic requires me to run it using sudo
2006-08-31T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	abo	ok, let's finish, you type a password (your password, not root's password, correct?), and then?
2006-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	abo	sethk	ok got the problem, as I said it's because I had to shut down while synaptic was running, to fix: dpkg --configure -a (if anyone else needs it) thanks all,  sethk, nozorro, jazzrocker, lamego
2006-08-31T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	abo	thanks
