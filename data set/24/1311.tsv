2010-05-11T09:59:00.000Z	myrl		i have apache2 and https works (port 443) but http doesnt work (port 80). I haven't installed a firewall, and I do port forwarding on my router. Whats wrong?
2010-05-11T09:59:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	which httpd?
2010-05-11T09:59:00.000Z	myrl		apache2
2010-05-11T09:59:00.000Z	myrl		does cox block port 80?
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	on the server itself what does http://localhost show you?
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	myrl		the webpage
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	on localhost http works
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	then port 80 is blocked somewhere.
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	myrl		hmm
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	myrl		where
2010-05-11T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	probably by the ISP. what ISP do you use?
2010-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	COX
2010-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	consumer or business account?
2010-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	consumer...
2010-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	my guess is that Cox explicitly disallows consumer-grade connections from running servers, and enforces it by port blocking.
2010-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	uh oh
2010-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	so now i cant have a webpage
2010-05-11T10:02:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	only if you run it on a non-standard port. and even so, your ISP TOS may well disallow it, and if they find it, could cut you off.
2010-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	D:
2010-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	i guess i will have to stop the server
2010-05-11T10:03:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	but https still works...
2010-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	myrl		lol
2010-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	mneptok	myrl	or call Cox and ask if they offer business grade accounts, and if they do, do they restrict traffic. then upgrade to the level.
2010-05-11T10:04:00.000Z	myrl	mneptok	ok but it may cost a fortune
