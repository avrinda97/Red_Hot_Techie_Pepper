2010-03-31T01:53:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	generell solution is the purge option of apt-get
2010-03-31T01:53:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - I tried that it didnt work
2010-03-31T01:53:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	how was it not working
2010-03-31T01:54:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - it says Package firefox is not installed, so not removed
2010-03-31T01:54:00.000Z	Kingsy102		which is impossible cos I have it open right now
2010-03-31T01:54:00.000Z	Kingsy102		and just launched a new copy
2010-03-31T01:55:00.000Z	Kingsy102	chelz	- so in that case how would I go about removing it?
2010-03-31T01:55:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	you need the version number
2010-03-31T01:55:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - 3.5.8
2010-03-31T01:56:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	then the package name might be firefox-3.5
2010-03-31T01:56:00.000Z	Kingsy102		ok
2010-03-31T01:56:00.000Z	Kingsy102		let me try that
2010-03-31T01:57:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - ok done.. and it seems to have gone
2010-03-31T01:58:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	hopefully you dont need any configuration stuff right now :)
2010-03-31T01:59:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - no I want a totally clean install
2010-03-31T02:02:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - ok this is REALLY doing my head in BADLY
2010-03-31T02:02:00.000Z	Kingsy102		I did sudo apt-get install firefox and it re-installed but ALL of my settings are back.. bookmarks everything
2010-03-31T02:02:00.000Z	Kingsy102		I want a clean install
2010-03-31T02:02:00.000Z	Kingsy102		ARRGGHH heh
2010-03-31T02:03:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	so how about deleted the config files in your home directory
2010-03-31T02:03:00.000Z	Kingsy102		ok
2010-03-31T02:08:00.000Z	Kingsy102	chelz	- thanks fixed it
2010-03-31T02:08:00.000Z	Kingsy102		Matisse - thanks
2010-03-31T02:11:00.000Z	Matisse	Kingsy102	no problem
