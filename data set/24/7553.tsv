2004-10-14T16:31:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	you never need to be root anyway on any distro
2004-10-14T16:33:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	or in gnome, pick whatever you want from the menu, and if it needs a password, it will ask for it.
2004-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	acroread, the plugin and mustimedia packages are in Christian Marillat's repository for unstable. seems to work for ubuntu too.
2004-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	don't use it for upgrades, just grab what you need and then comment it out again
2004-10-14T10:55:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	it's debian unstable anyway, so if it breaks, well, tough :)
2004-10-14T11:09:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	you probably used the wrong plugin. use the one compiled with gcc32
2004-10-14T11:09:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	I used gcc32 one 
2004-10-14T11:10:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	any idea what cud be the problem. Actually the site designed for IE. But I've user agent switcher extension for firefox
2004-10-14T11:11:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	no idea. any other java site works?
2004-10-14T11:11:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	let me see
2004-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	it's unsupported but if the package works it works. if not, it doesn't
2004-11-26T16:48:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	just watch out for not dragging in dangerous libraries as dependencies
2004-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	if you grab something from hoary, watch carefully or it will upgrade your whole system :)
2004-11-26T16:54:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	how about bittornado-gui
2004-11-26T16:55:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	bittornado-gui is there
2004-11-26T16:55:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	grab that and be done with it then ;)
2004-11-26T16:56:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	it's nice. you click a link and off it goes
2005-04-10T06:29:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	do u think Ubuntu will install a font that is not supported by GNOME?
2005-04-10T06:31:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	could be. perhaps you'd still want to use it in openoffice or mozilla
2005-04-10T06:32:00.000Z	topyli	guptan	anyway, file a bug in the ubuntu bugzilla. the good folks at ubuntu will find out who's to blame :)
2005-04-10T06:32:00.000Z	guptan	topyli	I will do that for sure
