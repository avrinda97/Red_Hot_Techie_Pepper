2009-08-29T23:21:00.000Z	pradeep		please help
2009-08-29T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	oh, just install samba
2009-08-29T23:25:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	it also does linux-to-linux for filesharing
2009-08-29T23:25:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	: thanks
2009-08-29T23:25:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	real file servers use CIFS, which is the protocol that samba uses. dunno about that python script, sounds third-party
2009-08-29T23:26:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	as long as the network is there, yearh
2009-08-29T23:26:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	*yeah
2009-08-29T23:27:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	I just don't understand the port 9900, that makes no sense for a file server
2009-08-29T23:27:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	server, yes. client, maybe.
2009-08-29T23:43:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	I installed samba on my laptop
2009-08-29T23:44:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	How do i start sharing
2009-08-29T23:45:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	btw, swat is a separate install
2009-08-29T23:47:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	i installed samba package
2009-08-29T23:47:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	wats the difference between them
2011-01-16T01:49:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	for SMTP?
2011-01-16T01:55:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	change the settings of your lan card to briged host adapter
2011-01-16T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	what?
2011-01-16T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	pradeep	I'm not the one using vbox here, Azareth is.
2011-01-16T01:57:00.000Z	pradeep	Gnea	Oh my bad thought you were the one
