2010-07-24T04:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	click on header, select "tree"
2010-07-24T04:06:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	yes
2010-07-24T04:07:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	i can click on "File", "Edit", "View", "Go", "Bookmarks" and "Help"
2010-07-24T04:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	view > check "Side Pane" if not checked, then on left pane header, select "tree"
2010-07-24T04:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	i see...  how do you call that left pane??  Is it possible to have more than one "left pane"??
2010-07-24T04:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	don't think so
2010-07-24T04:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	thanks a lot!  That's exactly what I was looking for, im going to have to use this nautilus thing more and more, do you have any other tip or trick up your sleeve you think i should know about nautilus?
2010-07-24T04:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	you're welcome
2010-10-21T02:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	what ubuntu version are you using?
2010-10-21T02:08:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	im running 10.04 which should not be too much different than the current one
2010-10-21T02:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	then you should have a network applet in the panel by default
2010-10-21T02:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	 it never worked on my laptop, I used to be able to just kill the applet, and it reappeared on its own, I cant make it work nowadays, I had to reimage my laptop because an update completely killed it
2010-10-21T02:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	strange, try nm-applet
2010-10-21T02:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	ive tried nm-applet to no avail
2010-10-21T02:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	open a terminal and type: killall nm-applet; nm-applet      see if there are any error messages?
2010-10-21T02:13:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	you mean: ps aux|grep nm-applet; killall nm-applet  ???
2010-10-21T02:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	nope, killall nm-applet should be enough
2010-10-21T02:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	killall -9 nm-applet    to be  sure
2010-10-21T02:14:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	no such process
2010-10-21T02:14:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	ok good, just type 'nm-applet' and see if there are any errors
2010-10-21T02:15:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	im going to have to use 2 utilities, one to set phasers to eth1, another to scan and attempt to login to the wireless routers, nm-aplet doesnt work on my laptop
2010-10-21T02:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	tucemiux	the questions is why? but anyhow, you could try using wicd instead of nm
2010-10-21T02:17:00.000Z	tucemiux	ilovefairuz	ill give wicz a try, thanks
