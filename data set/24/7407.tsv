2005-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	run pmount /dev/sda1
2005-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	change your nick to GuruBob or LifeSaverBob
2005-01-22T17:58:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	the dmesg says nothing about sda1, does it? (I want to know how you knew it was at /dev/sda1
2005-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	it's my job (I'm a sysadmin)
2005-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	sda is like hda, except scsi
2005-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	but seriously, I tried /dev/scsi0 /dev/sda - cause I saw no /dev/sda1 . So how can I find out in the future (my lappy has more than one USB port )
2005-01-22T06:00:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	cool
2005-01-22T06:01:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	you made my day. Thanks a million.
2005-01-22T06:04:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	to backup everything on my harddisk, do I just do a $sudo cp -r / /media/sda1/carthik/   ?
2005-01-22T06:04:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	I would not recommend that
2005-01-22T06:04:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	best to just backup your data
2005-01-22T06:05:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	so $sudo cp -r /mnt/windows /media/sda1/carthik/ ?
2005-01-22T06:05:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	yes that would backup all the windows files
2005-01-22T06:06:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	and for Linux file /home/carthik/ ...gotcha, thanks
2005-01-22T06:06:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	yep
2005-01-22T08:38:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	parted
2005-01-22T08:38:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	however if you're currently using it you'll have to use a liveCD or similar and then use it
2005-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	thanks, I'll remember to use it the next time I bootup (with a livecd)
2005-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	right now /home is not on a seperate partition, will parted help me move what's in /home now to the new partition ( there is only / as a seperate partition)
2005-01-22T08:46:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	you should be able to work out a way
2005-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	carthik	alternatively, if your home partition is the second partition
2005-01-22T08:52:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	the windows partition will make way for the to-be /home partition
2005-09-19T08:23:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	bob2, brenner - super! thanks
2005-09-21T10:09:00.000Z	carthik	HrdwrBoB	can you please unban kwikstah - sorry if this request is inappropriate or youre busy or something :)
