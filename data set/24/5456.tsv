2006-07-24T11:08:00.000Z	cypher1		any one using notifications in gaim ?
2006-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	you have to enable it in your plugin preferences
2006-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	make sure you enable 'guifications', not 'notifications'
2006-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	(I think that is what you want)
2006-07-24T11:12:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	i have only "message notification" plugin
2006-07-24T11:13:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	hmm ok, so you actually want the 'message notification' not the popups in the corner of your screen stuff (guifications)?
2006-07-24T11:16:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	no i want the guifications that come in the corner of the screen
2006-07-24T11:17:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	ok, since you said 'guifications' isn't showing up, can you check that the package was install ok?  What does 'apt-cache policy gaim-guifications' say?
2006-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	it says installed
2006-07-24T11:18:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	ok did you close gaim and start it up again?
2006-07-24T11:19:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	what version of gaim are you using?
2006-07-24T11:20:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	1.5.1cvs
2006-07-24T11:20:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	also http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18790
2006-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	hmm, Guifications should definitely be showing up under plugin settings for you to enable it
2006-07-24T11:23:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	no it is not showing up :(
2006-07-24T11:24:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	does the file /usr/lib/gaim/guifications.so exist on your system?
2006-07-24T11:24:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	yes
2006-07-24T11:25:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	I don't know then
2006-07-24T11:25:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	ok thanks
2007-06-02T07:02:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	thanks but is it possible to do it in command line of kernel.. this is because the kernel is panicing because of this module
2007-06-02T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	I don't know
2007-09-22T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	are you sure that won't format his old /home?
2007-09-22T15:03:00.000Z	cypher1	jrib	i think you have the option of not to reformat the partition
2007-09-22T15:03:00.000Z	jrib	cypher1	ah ok, flaco just make sure it's clear to you then that it won't be formatted and cypher1's suggestion sounds like the best in that case
