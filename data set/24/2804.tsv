2008-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	deadSDA		guys, I am on livecd,  The hard drive dseems corrupt, during install it crashes.  but filesystem seems to be on the hard drive now.  Even though it will not boot from HDD.  Anyone know what I can do in terminal to see if it will fix whatever is wrong with the HDD?
2008-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	man fsck
2008-08-12T05:18:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	fsck did not seem to want to help me, I run it as just fsck and it just spits out the options,  I do not know what to type with it
2008-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	well why dont u start with sudo fsck /dev/[partition name]
2008-08-12T05:20:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	figure out what your faulty partition name is and run fsck on it, its usually something like /dev/sda1
2008-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	thanks man, that is what is so confusing, it spits back clean.  with files and blocks
2008-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	are u sure u got the correct partition?
2008-08-12T05:22:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	yea that appears to be it
2008-08-12T05:22:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	run it on every partition u have
2008-08-12T05:22:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	just to be on the safe side
2008-08-12T05:23:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	that is the only partition
2008-08-12T05:23:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	then its not your filesystem
2008-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	when I go to install windows shows as a corrupt HD, when I try to install linux, it crashes.  I am so at a loss here
2008-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	both crash during the partition
2008-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	as your computer turns on press esc until u get to the boot menu you'll see a bunch of lines press 'e' on the first one, from there u should see like 4 lines find the one with splash at the end delete 'splash' press enter and then b, this will disable ubuntu splash screen allowing u to see any error messages that pop up during boot time
2008-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	oh u trying to install it? not run linux?
2008-08-12T05:26:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	correct, installing, I tried to run right from hard drive.  boot shows no installed OS.  Even though the file system is there.  but it crashed during the install from live cd
2008-08-12T05:27:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	I have tried several times, in fact, for the last 7 hours
2008-08-12T05:30:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	ok from the live cd do the following!!!WARNING!!! make sure theres no data on this or any other harddrives connected to the system, in fact if theres another harddrive unplug it. sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 this will zero out the whole harddrive
2008-08-12T05:30:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	thanks so much man, that looks promising lol
2008-08-12T05:32:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	this should take some time for that command to wipe everything right?
2008-08-12T05:35:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	yes it usually takes quite a while
2008-08-12T05:36:00.000Z	deadSDA	usser	thanks so much for the help man, I am gonna go smoke a cigar, I need to step away from this.  See you later
2008-08-12T05:37:00.000Z	usser	deadSDA	good luck
