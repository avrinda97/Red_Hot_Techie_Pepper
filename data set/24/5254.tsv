2006-09-05T14:16:00.000Z	Wettendorff		can anyone tell me how i join a workgroup??
2006-09-05T14:17:00.000Z	Wettendorff		can anyone tell me how i join a workgroup??
2006-09-05T14:17:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	install samba server... sudo apt-get install samba
2006-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	then you will have to edit the samba.conf file where it says network mshome
2006-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	thanks.. can i also join a domain in that??
2006-09-05T14:19:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	yes... just put the domain name in there but usernames/password for joining a windows domain controller with active directory is a little trickier. I think you have to get into LDAP with that
2006-09-05T14:20:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	thanks.. i will look in to it
2006-09-05T14:21:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	good luck thats what were here for
2006-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	where do i finde that samba.conf, so i can edit it?
2006-09-05T14:28:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	it was in /ect/samba and the file is called "smb.conf"
2006-09-05T14:28:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	did you find whre it says mshome?
2006-09-05T14:29:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	yea.
2006-09-05T14:29:00.000Z	gbrent	Wettendorff	all you do is change that to your domain or workgroup
2006-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	great... will read a litle more in that file..
2006-09-05T14:36:00.000Z	Wettendorff	gbrent	i cant save the file..
