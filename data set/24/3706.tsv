2008-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	squidly	Peddy	yes
2008-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	isn't the refresh rate meant to depend on the monitor, not the gfx card?
2008-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	squidly	Peddy	its dependent on both.
2008-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	squidly		but your card can do much faster then 50hz
2008-02-09T11:20:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	wow nvidia-settings isn't even loading ...

2008-02-09T11:22:00.000Z	squidly		it can be nasty to load at times

2008-02-09T11:23:00.000Z	squidly	Peddy	I've got dual opterons 248's.. and sometimes the nvidia-setting take up to 20 seconds to load
2008-02-09T11:23:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	one-upped :D
2008-02-09T11:24:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	20 seconds is nothing mate
2008-02-09T11:24:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	3 minutes
2008-02-09T11:26:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	ok it just finished loading, the settings haven't stuck :(
2008-02-09T11:34:00.000Z	Peddy	squidly	thanks for the help, nvidia-settings fixed my problem (even though the other progs are still displaying otherwise) but I can tell the difference. Bye.
