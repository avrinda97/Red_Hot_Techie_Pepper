2009-07-29T23:49:00.000Z	Cube		hey, i want to copy all JPG files in a folder (and its subfolders) to another folder, but some pictures have the same name, so i'd like a different name to be used so it doesnt overwrite anything. [basically gather all pictures, regardless if name is the same]
2009-07-29T23:50:00.000Z	deany	Cube	something like gthumb
2009-07-29T23:50:00.000Z	Cube	deany	well, im looking for a script (perhaps even a single line command)
2009-07-29T23:51:00.000Z	Cube	deany	but k ill have a look at gthumb
2009-08-04T01:07:00.000Z	deany	Cube	i use gthumb
2009-08-04T01:07:00.000Z	deany	Cube	oops, just read the whole of your post :)
2009-08-04T01:08:00.000Z	Cube	deany	yeah :P
2009-08-04T01:08:00.000Z	deany	Cube	I loved acdsee in windows.. works in wine too, version 2.1
2009-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	deany	Cube	tried gwenview?
2009-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	Cube	deany	now the funny thing is, that PICASA, which is also using wine, is very fast too (probably just as fast as digikam). isnt that kinda defeating the purpose? non-gnome apps beating gnome-apps?
2009-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	Cube	deany	nope, gonna give it a try now
2009-08-04T01:15:00.000Z	Cube	deany	this is ridiculous. thanks for pointing me to that app, its just as fast as digikam. but its kde beating gnome on a gnome desktop? wow
2009-08-04T01:20:00.000Z	deany	Cube	yeah its sad when a windows app even in wine beats a gnome app in gnome
2009-08-04T01:22:00.000Z	Cube	deany	yeah, + a kde app too
2009-08-04T01:26:00.000Z	Cube	deany	how do i set gwenview as the default image viewer? :P
2009-08-04T01:27:00.000Z	deany	Cube	dont know.
2009-08-04T01:27:00.000Z	deany	Cube	right click image file, open with
2009-08-04T01:36:00.000Z	deany	Cube	installin gwenview installs v4 of it
2009-08-04T01:36:00.000Z	deany	Cube	well it did for me...
2009-08-04T01:37:00.000Z	deany	Cube	last time I used it was while ago as this is a lot different than kde3 version.
2009-08-04T01:38:00.000Z	Cube	deany	kkthx
2009-08-04T01:40:00.000Z	deany	Cube	personally i`d use acdsee in wine but wine doesnt like the radeon driver, makes it lockup after x amount of time when using graphical apps like that.  when I had fglrx support (in 8.10) it was fine....
2009-08-04T01:41:00.000Z	deany	Cube	lockup as in, needing RSEIUB
2009-08-04T01:42:00.000Z	Cube	deany	hmm i gotcha.
