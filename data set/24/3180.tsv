2008-04-14T02:13:00.000Z	Danish989		hi everyone
2008-04-14T02:14:00.000Z	Danish989		I have a quick question: I want to isntall ubuntu on a partition with fat32 file system, which install option should I choose from the ubuntu install partioner, so that my existing data doesn't get removed and ubuntu creates a ext3 partition for itself without touching any other data on that disk?
2008-04-14T02:16:00.000Z	Danish989		can someone answer a quick installation question please?
2008-04-14T02:17:00.000Z	Danish989		I do want to install into the fat32 formatted partition
2008-04-14T02:17:00.000Z	Danish989		but doesnt ubuntu format the space into ext3?
2008-04-14T02:17:00.000Z	Danish989		and when it does that, does that mean the whole drive will be erased?
2008-04-14T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	you won't be able to install ubuntu onto a fat32 partition

2008-04-29T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	how ar eyou trying to install them ?
2008-04-29T18:12:00.000Z	Danish989	ikonia	I tried both ways, by dragging them in the appearance manager and also by choosing the Install option
2008-04-29T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	and what happens ?
2008-04-29T18:14:00.000Z	Danish989	ikonia	it asks me if I want to apply the new theme or keep the current, and no matter what I choose, I can't see the new theme in the thumbnails ..
2008-04-29T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	if you click "apply" does your theme not change on your desktop
2008-04-29T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	are these gtk / gnome themese or things like compiz/emerald
2008-04-29T18:15:00.000Z	Danish989	ikonia	GTK2+ themes
2008-04-29T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	thats odd, and it doesn't change your desktop theme if you click "apply"
2008-04-29T18:16:00.000Z	Danish989	ikonia	it did for one theme but that's it, it doesn't the rest of the times
2008-04-29T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	is there anything in the syslog that gives a clue "eg AgentX is having Y problem"
2008-04-29T18:17:00.000Z	Danish989	ikonia	I just got it! I was poking around, and I have to go into ''customize'' in themes in the appearance manager to see the installed themes ... sorry for wasting your time, and thanks :)
2008-04-29T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Danish989	ahh well done
