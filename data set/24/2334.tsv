2009-01-22T15:12:00.000Z	amitbk		hi, i want to install opera. i can't find it on the ubuntu repository. is it still there?
2009-01-22T15:13:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	is it in medibuntu?
2009-01-22T15:14:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	i use medibuntu, so i guess not
2009-01-22T15:15:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	let me do a search then
2009-01-22T15:27:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	how do you do such a search?
2009-01-22T15:31:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	yes, i followed the guidelines there before i came here to ask. i'm still getting a "E: Package opera has no installation candidate"
2009-01-22T15:31:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	after i update
2009-01-22T15:31:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	did you add that repo
2009-01-22T15:31:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	yup
2009-01-22T15:32:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	please paste.ubuntu.com with your sources.list
2009-01-22T15:34:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/108181/
2009-01-22T15:35:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	what are repos on line 54 and 55
2009-01-22T15:36:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	that's a good question, let me check
2009-01-22T15:36:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	i think i used them to install freemind
2009-01-22T15:37:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	the version in the repos is not up to date
2009-01-22T15:38:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	that is odd
2009-01-22T15:39:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	there are two other options ; one is get the opera repo or get the 3rd party deb, both of which will break package management
2009-01-22T15:51:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	sorry for the delay, i just got back. what do you mean it will break the package management if i install from the opera repo?
2009-01-22T15:52:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	depending on outside sources is always a risk; the 3rd party deb is what I should have said
2009-01-22T15:52:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	so you would rather d/l the specific deb than add the opera repo?
2009-01-22T15:52:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	just a second I will try to install opera from repos
2009-01-22T15:59:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	so the wiki is outdated as I cannot install from there either
2009-01-22T15:59:00.000Z	bazhang	amitbk	so you can use opera repos or get the deb
2009-01-22T16:00:00.000Z	amitbk	bazhang	ok, thanks. i'll go with the opera repos.
