2011-07-05T03:23:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	the menu for shutting down, sound, internet, all the stuff in the top right corner
2011-07-05T03:23:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	are you using gnome?
2011-07-05T03:24:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	right click on the bar where the menu used to be and open smth like "applets"
2011-07-05T03:25:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	type the name of the people that you want them to read your message, since the cannel is so big we can miss em else
2011-07-05T03:26:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	sorry, I forgot to type in your name
2011-07-05T03:26:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	any solution yet? ;)
2011-07-05T03:27:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	I can add all the things Im missing, but its not the orginal
2011-07-05T03:27:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	are you using ubuntu 11.04?
2011-07-05T03:27:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	yes, was just putting it on this computer
2011-07-05T03:34:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	back
2011-07-05T03:34:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	any luck?
2011-07-05T03:35:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	I had similar problem with ubuntu 10. something
2011-07-05T03:35:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	since i do not have ubuntu installed at the moment i cannot really help you alot more then that you should be able to add back lost applets
2011-07-05T03:35:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	to prevent this you should make sure all applets are locked all time
2011-07-05T03:36:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	they are all locked, thats the funny thing
2011-07-05T03:37:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	then you should lift your computer and throw it as hard as you can into the nearest wall. No but they shall not just dissapear, its something you install or do that does mess something up
2011-07-05T03:38:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	I was trying to get my s-video to work, I might have done something there that made those app disappear
2011-07-05T03:39:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	letting me know what s-video is might help me out a bit ;)
2011-07-05T03:40:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	s-video is basicly tv-out on my computer, I was trying to set it up, and i made a clean install with ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-05T03:40:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	with tv-out you mean just to use the tv as a screen?
2011-07-05T03:41:00.000Z	olafur	LilleCarl	yes, for some reasons my computer wont find my tv
2011-07-05T03:42:00.000Z	LilleCarl	olafur	hmmm that is a big problem :( i dont think i can assist you further even if i would like to :/
