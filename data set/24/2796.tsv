2008-10-14T14:38:00.000Z	blip-		hi everyone,  i'm installing kubuntu to use for development.  the main server machine is ubuntu 8.04... my question is will Kubuntu 8.10
2008-10-14T14:38:00.000Z	blip-		Kubuntu 8.10 beta have the same repo content as ubuntu 8.04 ?
2008-10-14T14:39:00.000Z	blip-		also can kubuntu 8.10 Beta be upgraded to non-beta without a reinstall ?   thanks
2008-10-14T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	yes, but its not advisable
2008-10-14T14:40:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	i see.  so it's better if i wait for kubuntu 8.10 Final ?   do you know where i can check the timeline for that ?
2008-10-14T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	october 30'th
2008-10-14T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	8.10  and 8.10 will be in sync
2008-10-14T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	8.10 and 8.04 version will not be compatible
2008-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	 so what if i use "Kubuntu 8.04 KDE4 Remix" ... won't that give me the coolness of kde4 and the compatiblity of 8.04 with the 8.04 server ?
2008-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	8.04 desktop and server are compatible anyway
2008-10-14T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	you don't need a "remix" or anything like that
2008-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	sorry i meant will the KDE4 remix of 8.04 = ubuntu 8.04 in terms of  underneath packages in the repos ?
2008-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	what you are saying makes no sense
2008-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	there is no need for any remix
2008-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	so how can i get kde4 on kubuntu 8.04 then ?
2008-10-14T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	the 8.04 packages are up to date and maintained and compatible with any ubuntu 8.04 problem
2008-10-14T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	install the kde4 packages
2008-10-14T14:47:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	ah i see :)
2008-10-14T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	they are int eh 8.04 repos
2008-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	 ok great.  so 8.10 is out of the picture then,  even though it looks soo cool  :)
2008-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	you can use 8.10 if you want, but not with a 8.04 base
2008-10-14T14:52:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	one last question please,  is my understanding correct that an ubuntu 8.10 will also come out... and will have an updated "base" which will not be the same packages as with 8.04.. so for example it may have lib-readline 1.3  instead of lib-readline 1.1  right ?
2008-10-14T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	blip-	correct
2008-10-14T14:53:00.000Z	blip-	ikonia	alright then.  thanks for the help
