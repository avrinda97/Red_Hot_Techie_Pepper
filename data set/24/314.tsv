2011-12-04T01:52:00.000Z	colloquialismic		hey guys
2011-12-04T01:52:00.000Z	colloquialismic		i was curious
2011-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	colloquialismic		is there a way to grab 50 different .jpegs and "mass save" them all to a newly created folder... and create that new folder as well
2011-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	colloquialismic		haha
2011-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	probably. where are you grabbing them from
2011-12-04T01:54:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	there are various command line email tools that could certainly download and extract attachments, but it would be a fair bit of setup. most decent email clients should have a save all attachments button
2011-12-04T01:54:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	gmail has a download as zip option
2011-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	and ThinkT510 Now... do you know of a linux equivalent of automater?
2011-12-04T02:01:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	what is automater?
2011-12-04T02:03:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	the apple thing. so there are a couple things. you could certainly generate fake xinput events, but its more traditional to figure out what batch process you want to do and then determine what the underlying tool is to do it. so if you are manipulating images with a photo tool, then you would use imagemagick
2011-12-04T02:03:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	so in the case you are describing you would use curl or wget to download the files
2011-12-04T02:05:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	you can hand wget a list of urls and it can download all of them. wget can crawl websites and mirror the whole thing if you want
2011-12-04T02:05:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	do you know how to do that off hand?
2011-12-04T02:06:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	if you are planning to do this once, there are plugins for firefox which can do the same and would be easier. otherwise you wget the html page, and then pull all the image links out of that, and wget all them
2011-12-04T02:07:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	its harder and harder these days given the increasing amount of javascript in webpages
2011-12-04T02:10:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	just out of curiosity what is the firefox extension that automatically pulls the images off html pages?
2011-12-04T02:10:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/
2011-12-04T09:48:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	good thing you aren't now :-P
2011-12-04T09:49:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	i always will be inquisitive :)
2011-12-04T09:51:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	sorry i don't buy apple anything
2011-12-04T09:51:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	now... why is that? i know you have a reason :)
2011-12-04T09:52:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	locked down overpriced hardware
2011-12-04T09:53:00.000Z	colloquialismic	escott	what is your opinion on the "best" laptop then?
2011-12-04T09:55:00.000Z	escott	colloquialismic	i've been fairly impressed with the asus i have at the moment. well priced, standard hardware, and who cares if its plastic if it works. my girlfriends hp envy... biggest waste of money ever
