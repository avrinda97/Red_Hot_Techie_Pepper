2008-12-01T11:53:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	copy and del will affectively remove fragmentation of a file in many cases even on vfat/ntfs
2008-12-01T11:53:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	okay, thanks..
2008-12-01T11:54:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	side effect of doing so on those M$ filesystems is that the fs it's self becomes more fragmented.
2008-12-01T11:55:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	i.e. while seeking to right one wrong you can create many more.     just a thought.
2008-12-01T11:55:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	you mean, for MS filesystems right? or for ext3 also?
2008-12-01T11:56:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	I read somewhere that files on ext FS will be accessed faster if you accessed it many times.
2008-12-01T11:56:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	particularly M$ file systems but i can't say that it will never happen on ext#
2008-12-01T11:57:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	only because it keeps the file in ram
2008-12-01T11:57:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	okay thanks
2008-12-01T11:57:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	only because it keeps the file in ram << a reboot undoes the multi-access benifit
2008-12-01T11:58:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	okay. I think I understand about caching and so on.
2008-12-01T11:58:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	that's partly why you see linux using over 3g ram on a 4g system.    yes file caching
2008-12-01T11:59:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	oh, that's the "cached" that shows up in the memory usage graph of the system monitor applet.
2008-12-01T12:00:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	linux is not a ram hog   but it does use ram for file caching if it can.   my system is using less than 23m right now    Memory Used/Total Percent: 22/502 MB (4%)
2008-12-01T12:00:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	on my 1GB. all 1GB is used.
2008-12-01T12:01:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	not all of the ram   use   free -m
2008-12-01T12:01:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	22MB?? really?! I'm using 488 MB/1GB.. the rest are cached.
2008-12-01T12:02:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	total: 1007; used: 989; free: 18; cached: 468;
2008-12-01T12:02:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	you have a very small ram usage...
2008-12-01T12:03:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	it's intentional.   but that's one of those things that only counts if measuring cyber cookiness   and we arent
2008-12-01T12:05:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	okay. I want to install more ram. when I use vbox to run XP, 1GB isn't quite enough. and when I do photo editing. I'm still deciding if I should increase to 2GB or 4GB.. can't decide.
2008-12-01T12:06:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	get 4     unless the price is a problem, always get the larger; time will make it small
2008-12-01T12:13:00.000Z	lianimator	_2	sloopy, alex_mayorga: 4 it is! price is not a problem, it's a little lower than 2x the price of 2GB. I'd have to throw out or sell out the 512MB x2 = 1GB currently installed.
2009-01-10T09:51:00.000Z	_2	lianimator	quote them or escape the spaces
