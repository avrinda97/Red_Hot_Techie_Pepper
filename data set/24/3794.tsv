2007-12-10T23:04:00.000Z	peppo		hm. I've installed Ubuntu on a 4GB memory stick, but I'm unable to boot it. am I toast if my BIOS doesn't seem to let me choose the USB memory stick as boot device?
2007-12-10T23:05:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Pretty much
2007-12-10T23:06:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	do you know if most newer motherboards/bioses support booting off of such media?
2007-12-10T23:06:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	I actually won't be booting it here at home, but at someone elses quite new homebuilt computer
2007-12-10T23:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	No, I do not know for sure. But I would assume so.
2007-12-10T23:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Ubuntu is not the best distro to boot from a USB. It would be better to use DLS or Puppy Linux. If you either one with QEMU, you can even boot *inside* a Windows or Linux OS.
2007-12-10T23:08:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	well, I really need to use Ubuntu Studio, the system is going to be used to record music onto an external USB hard drive
2007-12-10T23:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Did you try to install the LiveCD to the USB stick or are you trying to do a full system install?
2007-12-10T23:09:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	I've done a full UbuntuStudio install onto the USB stick
2007-12-10T23:09:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	it tried to install GRUB onto /dev/sdd (stick), but that failed for some reason
2007-12-10T23:10:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	The best way to install on an external HD is to first remove all internal HD then boot the LiveCD, then install to the external HD. That way, GRUB will automatically install in the right location.
2007-12-10T23:11:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	I can get you the link I used...
2007-12-10T23:11:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	that'd entail removing all my internal drives... not an elegant way
2007-12-10T23:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Just open up your computer and unplug it. You don't need it to boot the LiveCD anyways.
2007-12-10T23:12:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	unfortunately there's no livecd for ubuntustudio
2007-12-10T23:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	alternative should do also.
2007-12-10T23:13:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	that's what I installed
2007-12-10T23:13:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	I dunno how it'd differ if I ripped out all my hard drives...
2007-12-10T23:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Remove your internal hardrives ensure that grub is installed in the correct location.
2007-12-10T23:15:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	yeah. but I'll still not be able to boot it here seeing as how my bios doesn't support it. is a proper grub install necessary to boot it on a usb-boot-capable computer, you think?
2007-12-10T23:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	I believe so
2007-12-10T23:40:00.000Z	peppo	Odd-rationale	was it you that I spoke to earlier? I didn't find a way to reinstall grub using rescue. I tried running grub-installer in a terminal for the new disk, but it failed to start.
2007-12-10T23:42:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Hmm. I'm sorry. I don't know how to do that. The only way i've done it was in a fresh install. You can ask around though.
2007-12-10T23:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	peppo	Here's a link that I followed: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=3350119&postcount=5
