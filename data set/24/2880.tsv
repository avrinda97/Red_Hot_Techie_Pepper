2008-08-27T10:48:00.000Z	ansichart		Last night my update manager found several Kernel updates, so I downloaded them and rebooted my system.  After that, my wireless card can't be found.  I am using an Atheros card, and it appears that other people are having this same problem.  Google has been finding a lot of people having this same problem, but no solutions.
2008-08-27T10:48:00.000Z	ansichart		Is there a quick fix to this problem?
2008-08-27T10:49:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	my guess is that you installed a module for the kernel, new kernel means reinstalling the module
2008-08-27T10:51:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	So are you saying that the module I installed is the problem... is it easy to revert back to the module I was using?
2008-08-27T10:52:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	what I mean is that everytime you install a new kernel you need to tell reinstall the module. i believe the new kernel is in fact the same version as the old one so you can't really go back to the old one
2008-08-27T10:53:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	just reinstall the module
2008-08-27T10:54:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	I am not sure how to do that.  My update manager did everything for me, it found some updates so I downloaded them and rebooted.
2008-08-27T10:54:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	i reckon you will have to do that again. i don't have an atheros card so google will know more about that than i
2008-08-27T10:56:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	I'm not even sure to know what to Google.  But basically I would need to reinstall the module that the kernel uses for my wifi card.  How do I know what module I had? I can't really go back and time and use lsmod.
2008-08-27T10:57:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	lspci and find out the exact name/model for your wifi card. then google that
2008-08-27T10:58:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	Alright, I'll see if I can find out what the exact name and model is
2008-08-27T11:11:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	I think this should work.  I am re-installing the madwifi driver, which is compatible with my Atheros card.  Hopes this works.
2008-08-27T11:12:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	madwifi rings a bell. i believe that's exactly what you need
2008-08-27T11:13:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	I compiled and installed it before, I needed it to extend some capabilities of my card so I could put it in monitor mode, otherwise I couldn't.
2008-08-27T11:14:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	Well, I am going to restart my computer
2008-08-27T11:14:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	thanks.
2008-08-27T11:14:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	good luck :)
2008-08-27T11:17:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	It works!
2008-08-27T11:18:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	yay
2008-08-27T11:18:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	atheros released the specs of their wifi cards so hopefully there will be a free driver soon
2008-08-27T11:18:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	that means, no need to work black magic on the terminal
2008-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	A lot of other people had this same problem with Atheros when they upgraded the Kernel.  I'm going to go on those forums and share the knowledge that you passed to me.
2008-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	leo_rockw	ansichart	way to go. the community will thank you
2008-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	ansichart	leo_rockw	:-)
