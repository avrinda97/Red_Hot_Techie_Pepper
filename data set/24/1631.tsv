2009-10-26T10:54:00.000Z	quaredscube		When 9.10 comes out, can I upgrade my previous version to it (I run 8.04)?
2009-10-26T10:55:00.000Z	quaredscube		Or do I have to reinstall?
2009-10-26T10:55:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	youll have to upgrade through the other versions
2009-10-26T10:55:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	or reinstall. either one. skipping releases on upgrade is not supported except to go from one LTS to another. the next being 10.04
2009-10-26T10:56:00.000Z	quaredscube	maco	so every 6 months I must reinstall?
2009-10-26T10:56:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	you can upgrade
2009-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	but you cannot upgrade from 8.04 to 9.10 because 8.10 and 9.04 happened in between
2009-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	you can upgrade through 8.10 and 9.04
2009-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	or every 6 months upgrade as new versions are released
2009-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	or every 2 years upgrade as new LTS versions are released
2009-10-26T10:58:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	but distances > 6 months and < 2 years require more work
2009-10-26T10:58:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	by upgrade through, i men tell 8.04 to go to 8.10, then tell 8.10 to go to 9.04, then tell 9.04 to go to 9.10
2009-10-26T10:59:00.000Z	quaredscube	maco	does upgrading to the new 6 month version require manual effort on my part, or does Ubuntu include the necessaries when I use the update tools?
2009-10-26T10:59:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	its in the update tools
2009-10-26T10:59:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	in system -> administration -> software sources, there is an option to either notify you about all new versions, only new LTS verisons, or not at all
2009-10-26T11:00:00.000Z	quaredscube	maco	thanks
2009-10-26T11:00:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	set it to the all new versions setting, and it should offer to go to 8.10
2009-10-26T11:00:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	er the second it = the update manager
2009-10-26T11:00:00.000Z	quaredscube	maco	why does it require more effort to upgrade to the next LTS?
2009-10-26T11:01:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	one LTS to the next LTS is a single upgrade. its easy
2009-10-26T11:01:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	its when you want to go from 1 version to another where they are *not* both LTS and also not sequential that its more annoying
2009-10-26T11:02:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	the effort required to make skipping releases easy is somethng that is only expended for LTS
2009-10-26T11:04:00.000Z	quaredscube	maco	what do you think of Mint?
2009-10-26T11:04:00.000Z	maco	quaredscube	never tried it
