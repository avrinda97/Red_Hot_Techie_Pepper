2006-04-14T11:25:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	that dist-upgrade interested me too, is there anything bad about it? will it completely upgrade my system or some things will be left?
2006-04-14T11:25:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	it will completely upgrade everything
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	just if new default packages are added to dapper you'll need to pull them in using apt-get or synaptic
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	so all the packages, desktop environment, kernel, everything will be replaced just as I installed them?
2006-04-14T11:26:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	i.e. there is a new network monitor program...and unless you do a fresh installations or install it manually later...it will be left off
2006-04-14T11:27:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	to your question:  yes
2006-04-14T11:27:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	and then I'll have dapper and no more breezy so I continue using dappers repositories, right?
2006-04-14T11:27:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	yup
2006-04-14T11:27:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	the beauty of a debian-based system is that you can never have to reinstall
2006-04-14T11:28:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	yeh I have noticed that package system works flawlesly
2006-04-14T11:28:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	just change sources.list to point to dapper and apt-get dist-upgrade and viola
2006-04-14T11:28:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	I was using suse but it is no near to ubuntu or debian
2006-04-14T11:28:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	it's the best package management system out there....portage is the only package manager that comes close
2006-04-14T11:29:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	yeah you can get into a RPM nightmare
2006-04-14T11:29:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	but portage is about sources, while debs are still binarys which makes it even simpler...
2006-04-14T11:29:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	not can get... been there, done that :P it's terrible... rpms suck...
2006-04-14T11:30:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	and that yast, like it never heard of word dependency...
2006-04-14T11:30:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	yeah rpms do you suck...yeah portage is sources but when i used gentoo i never had dependency problems i just got tired of compiling everything
2006-04-14T11:31:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	I thought going for gentoo too, but then I though of compiling everything, and I sit back and went for ubuntu
2006-04-14T11:31:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	yeah ubuntu is nice because if you want to tinker you still can
2006-04-14T11:31:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	but gentoo there are just no packages and it can be a friggin' hassle to wait 24 hours to use oo.org2
2006-04-14T11:33:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	anyway, ubuntu works just great for me... although suse is a bit simpler to use because of so many gui tools, there is nothing in suse that makes it better than ubuntu
2006-04-14T11:33:00.000Z	lutra	anymo	yeah
2006-04-14T11:34:00.000Z	anymo	lutra	I have been compiling from sources some programs on suse and on ubuntu... on ubuntu they work flawleslly while on suse for each one of them I spent whole afternoon
