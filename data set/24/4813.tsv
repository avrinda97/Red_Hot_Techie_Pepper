2007-07-17T11:52:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	try to get an intel card they have the best support, if we are still taking about wifi
2007-07-17T11:52:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	Im not rich >.<
2007-07-17T11:53:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	that's like $40-50...
2007-07-17T11:53:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	http://shop2.outpost.com/product/4609878?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG = good price
2007-07-17T11:57:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	there is a website that has all wifi cards listed + manufacturer + linux compatibility check there
2007-07-17T11:58:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	I really tell you spending twice as much in a quality card will get you way better range and quality.
2007-07-17T11:59:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	what about the $54 dollar one her: http://intel.links.channelintelligence.com/pages/showdealeritems.asp?nVID=11115&nRGID=328
2007-07-17T12:01:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	that link is wrong.
2007-07-17T12:01:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	then that's not a wifi card
2007-07-17T12:05:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	what do you suggest
2007-07-17T12:06:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	I'm vias all my cards have been intel...
2007-07-17T12:27:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	listen to the little voice inside your head
2007-07-17T12:28:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	the one that says burn my computer?
2007-07-17T12:28:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	umm yup that's probably it.
2007-07-17T13:20:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	why?
2007-07-17T13:21:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	remember the error?
2007-07-17T13:22:00.000Z	FusE	elpargo	I need to actually reinstall edgy and feisty, theres where my network went wrong
2007-07-17T13:28:00.000Z	elpargo	FusE	in theory you just boot back into the CD and everything should work.
