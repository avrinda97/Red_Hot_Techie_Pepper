2006-11-12T08:29:00.000Z	Poromenos		a package requires python2.3 so i can't install it, is there any way to skip this dependency and see if it'll work?
2006-11-12T08:30:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Can't it use a version greater than 2.3?
2006-11-12T08:31:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	probably, but it stops in installation
2006-11-12T08:31:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	What package?
2006-11-12T08:31:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	It's not in the Ubuntu repository. Where did you get this package from?
2006-11-12T08:32:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	http://actlab.tv/snakebite.html
2006-11-12T08:35:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	First you want to see what all packages this one depends on.
2006-11-12T08:35:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	well, python2.3 and bittorrent
2006-11-12T08:36:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	I think..
2006-11-12T08:37:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	dpkg -i --ignore-depends=python2.3 snakebite-rc3.deb
2006-11-12T08:37:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	ah, that worked, thanks!
2006-11-12T08:37:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Does dpkg complain though?
2006-11-12T08:38:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Right. sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.3
2006-11-12T08:39:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Good luck =)
2006-11-12T08:40:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Short? Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby
2006-11-12T08:41:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	that's a book :p
2006-11-12T08:41:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	There's no universal rule stating that books cannot be guides.
2006-11-12T08:41:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	but there is a universal rule that states that books aren't short :p
2006-11-12T08:41:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	No there isn't.
2006-11-12T08:42:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	=)
2006-11-12T08:42:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Compared to some "bibles" I've seen, Why's guide is very, very short :)
2006-11-12T08:43:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	i was thinking of something more like this: http://www.poromenos.org/tutorials/python :P
2006-11-12T08:43:00.000Z	kuja_	Poromenos	Though, if you wanted to get started (or rather, memorize basics) real quick, you could check out zenspider's "QuickRef", just google for "zenspider quickref"
2006-11-12T08:43:00.000Z	Poromenos	kuja_	ah, that's better, but too "referency"
