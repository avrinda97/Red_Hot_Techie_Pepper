2007-08-08T08:01:00.000Z	dasickis_		hey does anyone know how to change the defaults for certain UNIX programs
2007-08-08T08:01:00.000Z	dasickis_		like Shred
2007-08-08T08:01:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	man shred
2007-08-08T08:04:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	why would becoming a good C++ developer necessitate OpenBSD?
2007-08-08T08:04:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	it doesn't it's good example code to learn secure coding
2007-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	perhaps kernel level, but a lot of software comes to them from third parties and they patch that
2007-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	even Ubuntu code, but if you're interested in secure coding
2007-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	yeah so its still good example code and its very well documented
2007-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	define Ubuntu code, there's Linux if you mean kernel level
2007-08-08T08:05:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	also Ubuntu code, but it's not as mature in security as OpenBSD
2007-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	define Ubuntu code
2007-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	you do realize the difference between userland and kernel right?
2007-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	yeah
2007-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	then what's "Ubuntu" code?
2007-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	the code that Ubuntu has built up from the Debian base
2007-08-08T08:07:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	the code that the developers are actively working on
2007-08-08T08:07:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	as in the package manager? because Ubuntu is not GNOME for example
2007-08-08T08:07:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	I know
2007-08-08T08:09:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	what do you think ubuntu codes
2007-08-08T08:09:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	developers*
2007-08-08T08:09:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	Ubuntu developers maintain packages for the most part
2007-08-08T08:10:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	I thought they are expanding and changing a lot of the Debian code
2007-08-08T08:10:00.000Z	grml	dasickis_	still, if you mean to say kernel, say Linux and not Ubuntu
2007-08-08T08:10:00.000Z	dasickis_	grml	true sorry about that
