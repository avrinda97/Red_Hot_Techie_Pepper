2011-09-16T19:34:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	CBR is better than VBR am I right?
2011-09-16T19:34:00.000Z	edbian	dean__	I believe so.  VBR is lower quality but is more efficient in bits vs quality
2011-09-16T19:35:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	Ok cool thanks gonna try converting now lol
2011-09-16T19:35:00.000Z	edbian	dean__	sure

2011-09-16T19:39:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	It has worked a charm got my motorhead flacs in mp3 format now your a legen
2011-09-16T19:39:00.000Z	edbian	dean__	your welcome!
2011-09-16T19:39:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	For future reference as you seem like you know what your doing is there a flac cue splitter gui?
2011-09-16T19:40:00.000Z	edbian	dean__	I have never heard of one.  People generally don't edit cue files by hand. Just make a new cue file.
2011-09-16T19:40:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	It was one flac file that was the only problem had to use medievil cue splitter in vbox windoze lol

2011-09-16T19:41:00.000Z	dean__	edbian	No worries worth a shot anyway thanks
