2008-12-02T18:16:00.000Z	ddgoose	dietwater	your mac address should not change for no reason
2008-12-02T18:17:00.000Z	dietwater		Well I added mine to their list and it changed after a restart...
2008-12-02T18:17:00.000Z	ddgoose	dietwater	did you mean ip address?
2008-12-02T18:17:00.000Z	dietwater		No, I mean mac address.  I'm not a nubcake lol.
2008-12-02T18:18:00.000Z	ddgoose	dietwater	what hardware?
2008-12-02T18:19:00.000Z	dietwater		Whats the command to see networking drivers again?
2008-12-02T18:19:00.000Z	dietwater		nm
2008-12-02T18:20:00.000Z	dietwater		So how I get my wifi driver?
2008-12-02T18:21:00.000Z	dietwater		I know mine starts with an M XD.
2008-12-02T18:22:00.000Z	dietwater		It's a marvell.  I remembered.
2008-12-02T18:22:00.000Z	dietwater		Should be an internal wifi modem.
2008-12-02T18:22:00.000Z	dietwater		I had a problem with it back in 8.04.
2008-12-02T18:23:00.000Z	dietwater		Sorry, it's an atheros.
2008-12-02T18:24:00.000Z	dietwater		Atheros ar928x pci-express

2008-12-02T18:26:00.000Z	dietwater		My card works.  The problem is my mac address changed, and I'm worried it will again.  Is this just a weird problem?
2008-12-02T18:27:00.000Z	dietwater		I added mine to the school's list, and then it changed the next day and I'm like wut?
2008-12-02T18:27:00.000Z	dietwater		That made perfect sense =)
2008-12-02T18:28:00.000Z	ddgoose	dietwater	probably has something to do with udev and forcedeth, take a loot at dmesg and see if it is giving an error and generating a random MAC
2008-12-02T18:28:00.000Z	dietwater		This was a while ago, thanks for that command, I'll try once I re-change it =)
2008-12-02T18:29:00.000Z	ddgoose	dietwater	will show up in logs like -> 0000:00:0a.0: Invalid Mac address detected: 1d:9b:2a:38:1b:00
