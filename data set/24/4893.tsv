2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		no, it's ubuntu
2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		I'm asking about openoffice.org
2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		OOo
2006-12-18T06:42:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		durh
2006-12-18T06:44:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		Can somoene tell me how to start stack programming in OOo?
2006-12-18T06:44:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		duh
2006-12-18T06:44:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		maybe there's another package it does stacking with
2006-12-18T06:45:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk		i thought ubuntu came with openoffice.org?
2006-12-18T06:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	You'll get more luck in a OOo package, cause they know what they're doing.
2006-12-18T06:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	channel, even.
2006-12-18T06:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Not many people know about programming OOo in here. Seriously. Make life easier for yourself by going to #users.openoffice.org
2006-12-18T06:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	You're very welcome to help here, but the chances of someone knowing the answer to your query are low compared to that of the #users.openoffice.org. So why ask in here?
2006-12-18T06:50:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk	Stormx2	 do you even know what stack programming is?
2006-12-18T06:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	no. but i'm sure the people in #users.openoffice.org do ;-)
2006-12-18T06:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Haha. Oh dear.
2006-12-18T06:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Well I can suggest you ask in ubuntuforums.org, or the OOo forums?
2006-12-18T06:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Heh, well a lot of us frequent this room. Questions specific to a large piece of software with many maintainers and a large user base are usually directed elsewhere, see? Its unfortunate that the kind people at OOo are pinning this down on #ubuntu
2006-12-18T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Eek. Okay sorry. Try ubuntuforums.org
2006-12-18T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	i don't think anyone in here knows.
2006-12-18T06:53:00.000Z	Japanese_Hunk	Stormx2	 I did.
2006-12-18T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Post a topic then ;-)
2006-12-18T06:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Post a topic. I don't think anyone in here knows the answer to your query. Sorry! :)
2006-12-18T06:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	Japanese_Hunk	Have you tried rebooting? You can reboot from command line.
