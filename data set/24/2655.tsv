2009-12-31T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	you can add the nvidia ppa and install the driver from there
2009-12-31T06:49:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	tell me how pls
2009-12-31T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	https://launchpad.net/~nvidia-vdpau/+archive/ppa
2009-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	Is there a simple way i can just reinstall the driver
2009-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia*; sudo apt-get --purge autoremove
2009-12-31T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	you can then install the driver from the nvidia ppa (if you wish)
2009-12-31T06:58:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	i need the driver, how do i install that ppa
2009-12-31T06:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	you can run software sources and add the ppa lane as an extra repo, then when you close it you can run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-190
2009-12-31T07:01:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	in software sources i know how to add a repo, but waht to i typin in for ppa
2009-12-31T07:02:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	ahh ok got it
2009-12-31T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	you can do it at command line with: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nvidia-vdpau/ppa
2009-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	you can then run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-190
2009-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MetalNate	i dont like hand holding but it was getting long and I wanna go to bed
2009-12-31T07:06:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	sorry man, but when it comes to drivers and stuff on here, im totally lost but i think i've got it from here i really appreciate your help
2009-12-31T07:09:00.000Z	MetalNate	ActionParsnip	on second thought i did what you said, and when i click my nvidia button it says you do not appear to be using an nvidia driver run nvidia-xconfig (which i did) and restart x server ( i think i did)
