2008-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	donkey7186		i need help with my Firefox. It seems that when i go onto myspace and look at profiles that have certain themes i cannot click on Send Message,  Add Friend, Instant Message, Picutes. But I know it is on Ubuntu because when i go onto Windows OS i am able to click on them. Please help
2008-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	chances are it's just a difference between the way firefox and IE render web pages
2008-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	Hmm... can you give me an example of one?
2008-03-27T08:46:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	I've requested to add you as a friend so I can see your profile
2008-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	I see what the problem is. There's a bug in the Flash plugin for Firefox which causes flash applets to appear over top of everything else, even if they are supposed to display underneath things
2008-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	You can use Adblock to disable individual flash objects to work around the problem
2008-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	one sec
2008-03-27T08:54:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	I've looked again at that page, and I'm not sure Adblock will fix the problem after all. The thing is, if you hide the flash applet you won't be able to see the links to click on them
2008-03-27T08:59:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	once you've installed adblock, you'll see a tab on each Flash applet on a webpage you visit that says "Block", click on that.
2008-03-27T08:59:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	but like I say, on those Myspace pages, when you block the applet, you won't be able to see the links to click on them
2008-03-27T09:01:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	by default it should only be blocking ads
2008-03-27T09:02:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	what is it blocking that you need to click on?
2008-03-27T09:05:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	adblock isn't blocking the links. If you've told it to block the flash applet, you just can't see the links. See, what's happening is the theme makes the links invisible and puts them over the text in the flash applet, to make it look like you're clicking on the flash applet
2008-03-27T09:06:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	you will probably have to wait until the bug in Flash is fixed
2008-03-27T09:07:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	or install a userscript to block custom myspace themes, like this one: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/997
2008-03-27T09:09:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	first install Greasemonkey: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748
2008-03-27T09:10:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	then click on the "Install Script" link at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/997
2008-03-27T09:11:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	it should be, just testing it myself here
2008-03-27T09:12:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	you can, but only if you like seeing ads on web pages :)
2008-03-27T09:14:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	looks like I spoke too soon. You'll still need to use Adblock to disable the flash applets
2008-03-27T09:16:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	sorry man, that's about all I can suggest...
2008-03-27T09:17:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	you can remove the add-ons from the Tools>Add-Ons menu
2008-03-27T09:49:00.000Z	MightyTweek	donkey7186	what instructions did you follow to install IE?
