2007-12-29T04:23:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	Weasel[DK], not really.  You don't get whatever gain you would from the 64bit OS, but 32bit OS wont run slower on it
2007-12-29T04:24:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	i had the same thought as your...but when i intalled a winxp-64BE on a athlon 64 x2, some apps really run faster than on a 32BE
2007-12-29T04:24:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	for example games
2007-12-29T04:25:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	so why on ubuntu it would be different?
2007-12-29T04:25:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	i mean if there was no difference between 32 and 63 bit editions, so why does the 64BE exist?
2007-12-29T04:28:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	The 64bit OS is faster in some areas, but most general application use there is little, if any, difference.
2007-12-29T04:28:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	the benefit of larger registers and more of them is offset by the overhead of larger pointers and such
2008-01-09T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	/home is where everything *you* personally own is in (well, users as a whole), and / is where everything else is (everything that doesnt have its own partition)
2008-01-09T11:45:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	I don't get it. They are the same or they represent different partitions?
2008-01-09T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	/ contains /home and everything else (/var, /usr, /etc, etc) however, you *can* make dedicated partitions for any arbitrary folder and use it as that folder
2008-01-09T11:51:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	so you mean that "/" is the father of any other partition created...is it?
2008-01-09T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	no, / is a "label" you give to a partition.  Partitions are physical things (theyre sections of the disk), the folder things are sematics more or less.  Just how linux uses those partitions
2008-12-13T08:53:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	wav files are about 85KB per second
2008-12-13T08:54:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	Indeed.
2009-06-26T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	gloobus is in Karmic, its brand new, etc.
2009-06-26T02:09:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	what do u mean?
2009-06-26T02:09:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	i saw guides for ubuntu 8.10 also
2009-06-26T02:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	Hmmm, no, nevermind.  It's not in karmic.  https://launchpad.net/gloobus  They've apparently released a deb, but I can't find it on that page.
2009-06-26T02:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	You'll want to follow the guides then.  It's not in the repos
2009-06-26T02:11:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	i'll take a look on this website..
2009-06-26T02:13:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	mmm..the only downloadable package is for karmic..
2009-06-26T02:13:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	is it possible to install?
2009-06-26T02:14:00.000Z	Flannel	rodolfo	I have no idea.  I'm not familiar with that package/program at all, you might ask whatever support/forums/whatever they have
2009-06-26T02:14:00.000Z	rodolfo	Flannel	mm..ok..thanx anyway
