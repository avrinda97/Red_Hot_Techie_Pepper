2012-07-02T21:23:00.000Z	TiZ		Hi. It takes a long time for the boot splash to appear when I start my computer. I get a blank screen for about 15 seconds after POST, and then the splash appears. Why does it take so long? Can I do anything to fix this?
2012-07-02T21:25:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	check dmesg. look at the timestamps (which are in seconds after boot) and see what is taking a long time
2012-07-02T21:26:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	I've got a ten second gap in my dmesg: http://pastie.org/4188402
2012-07-02T21:28:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	you might install bootchart
2012-07-02T21:29:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	I can give that a try, but I dunno what it'll tell me.
2012-07-02T21:30:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	it will put some png files in /var/bootchart which are helpful. my suspicious is libreadahead just taking longer on your hardware than others
2012-07-02T21:31:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	Okay then. I'll give it a shot.
2012-07-19T22:50:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	is it a laptop with nvidia optimus?
2012-07-19T22:51:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	No, just a desktop. I'm just trying to get triple head up and running, and happen to have only two usable display ports on both the onboard intel and the nvidia card.
2012-07-19T22:52:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	then with a complicated xorg.conf you probably could get it to work, but there will be issues. especially with acceleration
2012-07-19T22:52:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	delightful. :<
2012-07-19T22:53:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	depending on what you need triple head for. it might be better to run one X server on nvidia as your main accelerated system, and another X server on intel with no acceleration. They won't be joined so you wont be able to move windows from one to the other, but thats easier
2012-07-19T22:54:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	That's something I was thinking about doing while I was still dinking around with displaylink, but you can't seamlessly move the cursor back and forth between them, can you?
2012-07-19T22:54:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	you would need a second set of input devices as well (or a switch device)
2012-07-19T22:55:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	That's way too much of a pain.
2012-07-19T22:56:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	the problem comes down to libGL being a symlink to one and only one GL implementation. so at least one display would be unaccelerated, and then if one is unaccelerated your window manager would be unaccelerated...
2012-07-19T22:57:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	Oh, no. I intend to just use nouveau.
2012-07-19T22:57:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	Mesa will be the only GL implementation on my system. I just want the three displays.
2012-07-19T22:57:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	then it might work. give it a try. i think you will need to hand edit your xorg.conf
2012-07-19T22:58:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	I'm not afraid to do that, I started in Hardy. :P
2012-07-21T05:09:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	perhaps it is going to sleep
2012-07-21T05:12:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	That's strange. That doesn't happen when I plug it into the windows laptop sitting next to me. How do I stop it from doing that?
2012-07-21T05:14:00.000Z	escott	TiZ	not sure why it would be different on linux. i would have thought this would be an issue with the firmware in the mouse
2012-07-21T05:14:00.000Z	TiZ	escott	I don't know either. :/
