2010-09-10T23:28:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	can ssh though, it goes up far enough
2010-09-10T23:30:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 not to confuse things, but is your primary problem that you can't boot without a display?
2010-09-10T23:31:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	yes
2010-09-10T23:32:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 or disable gdm to get booted.
2010-09-10T23:32:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	it boots far enough that I can ssh, so maybe I phrased it wrong, it books but gdm wont start
2010-09-10T23:33:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 yeah, i'm thinking just disabling gdm from starting so the headless box comes up to a login prompt. then you can futz with remote X stuff once you can actually get to it.
2010-09-10T23:34:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 vnc runs on a dummy display. you can reconnect and resume. it's like windows terminal services in a way.
2010-09-10T23:34:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 i do not recall details of headless though!
2010-09-10T23:34:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	so how i start the service?
2010-09-10T23:35:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 i understand what you're saying. there is no X from which to launch vncserver.
2010-09-10T23:36:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 i do not recall the details, and my experience is YEARS old anyhow. i was focusing on getting it booted without a display 1st.
2010-09-10T23:37:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	yea exactly
2010-09-10T23:37:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	yea im sorry it does boot, the gdm doesn't sorry i misphrased it
2010-09-10T23:38:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 no problem. i assume you do want a login prompt, so suggestion still applies! a quick google makes me think vnc as a service works for what you want for the remote access. no firsthand experience with it in years myself.
2010-09-10T23:39:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	but no x server running to launch it from
2010-09-10T23:40:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 this summarizes what i'm trying to say - http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/headless-dual-boot.html
2010-09-10T23:42:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	ok i'll read that
2010-09-10T23:44:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 look like he did it last year - http://scotttyee.com/blog/2009/12/09/linux-headless-ubuntu-with-vnc/
2010-09-10T23:45:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	yea this problem only occurs in 10.04
2010-09-10T23:45:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 ok, sorry. i'll step out now.
2010-09-11T00:13:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	gelbihan sacralson yea, i guess all that works, i found a way to launch it from command line
2010-09-11T00:32:00.000Z	bobstro	jak-install	 in a good way?
2010-09-11T00:32:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	yea
2010-09-11T00:35:00.000Z	jak-install	bobstro	and now i moved it and i dont think its gonna do it again
