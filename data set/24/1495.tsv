2010-04-06T02:10:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I've installed Ubuntu 9.10 and can't connect to my wlan. The SSID is showing in the network manager tool (so I assume the device is recognised), I entered the passphrase but I always get a "can't connect/no IP address" error message. Any idea where to look first?

2010-04-06T02:10:00.000Z	jarray52	vlt	Do you know how to do that?
