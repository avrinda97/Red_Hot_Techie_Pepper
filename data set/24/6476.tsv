2005-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	TedLemon		breezy or hoary, I mean
2005-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	TedLemon		hm, ok.   I had trouble making hoary work on my Sony too.
2005-10-12T06:31:00.000Z	TedLemon		Have you tried burning a breezy colony 5 cd?
2005-10-12T06:32:00.000Z	TedLemon		I'd suggest you try that - it might work better.   I think they do, yes.
2005-10-12T06:32:00.000Z	TedLemon		I'm running breezy very happily on my Vaio now.   :')
2005-10-12T06:32:00.000Z	TedLemon		If only kmail wouldn't crash.
2005-10-12T06:33:00.000Z	TedLemon		but don't panic - that's the only thing I've had trouble with, which is pretty good all things considered.
2005-10-12T06:33:00.000Z	TedLemon		http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/breezy/colony-5/
2005-10-12T06:34:00.000Z	TedLemon		bob, is there an overall build system, or do you just build individual packages?
2005-10-12T06:34:00.000Z	TedLemon		sure
2005-10-12T06:35:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	hm? ubuntu uses an automated build system to build them all.
2005-10-12T08:42:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	questions like that need to be accompanied by sources.list and full apt output
2005-10-12T08:44:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	why are you using pbuilder?
2005-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	pbuilder is not useful for random development work
2005-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	it's only useful for test-building packages
2005-10-12T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	you're not using breezy?
2005-10-12T08:48:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	then why not build kmail on your normal system?
2005-10-12T08:50:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	apt-get source kmail
2005-10-12T08:50:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	(in your homedir)
2005-10-12T08:51:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	that gets yo uthe source the binary packages were built from, yes
2005-10-12T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	did you install the build dependencies?
2005-10-12T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	sudo apt-get build-dep kmail
2005-10-12T09:02:00.000Z	bob2	TedLemon	the command I gave will install them
2005-10-12T09:10:00.000Z	TedLemon	bob2	for some reason when I ask apt-get to do that, it insists that it wants to deinstall skype.
