2008-11-04T22:05:00.000Z	kikagage	_Azlan_	does grub load at all or is just straight to black?
2008-11-04T22:05:00.000Z	_Azlan_		nothing loads, its just black
2008-11-04T22:06:00.000Z	_Azlan_		well, im gonna back up my whole harddrive and install on a clean boot and see what happens...
2008-11-04T22:06:00.000Z	_Azlan_		i was just wondering if any of ya knew why that would happen
2008-11-04T22:07:00.000Z	kikagage	_Azlan_	Well it's kind of hard to do anything if grub is loading, I heard of this issue with ubuntu though before trying to look for some a past forum disscussion on it and see if they found an answer to it
2008-11-04T22:08:00.000Z	_Azlan_	kikagage	thanks man
2008-11-04T22:10:00.000Z	kikagage	_Azlan_	you got an intel card by any chance?

2008-11-04T22:17:00.000Z	kikagage	_Azlan_	The thing I'd probably recommend is boot with the livecd and edit you xorg.conf file
2008-11-04T22:21:00.000Z	_Azlan_		ok, ill try that
2008-11-04T22:21:00.000Z	_Azlan_		tnaks
