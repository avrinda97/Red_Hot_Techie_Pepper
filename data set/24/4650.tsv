2007-03-04T11:09:00.000Z	eshaase		i just finished installing ubuntu and i booted up my new system... it loads the splash screen and then dissappears only to show a console with a blank screen a blinking underscore cursor in the top-left corner of the screen, any ideas?
2007-03-04T11:10:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	I had that same problem, here's what to do
2007-03-04T11:11:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	whats that?
2007-03-04T11:11:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	1) press alt-ctrl-F1. 2) type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" without the quotes of course. 3) choose the defaults for most things, but when you get to video drivers, choose vesa.
2007-03-04T11:11:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	that should get your monitor to work
2007-03-04T11:12:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	control-alt-f1 shows a new console but it seems to be frozen and i can't type
2007-03-04T11:12:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	it only shows "Starting up ...\n 4 logical volume(s) in volume group "systemvg" now active
2007-03-04T11:12:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	how did you do control-alt-f1 then? weird
2007-03-04T11:13:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	how did i do control-alt-f1 then?
2007-03-04T11:13:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	oh, I just thought that wouldn't work if your keys are frozen, but the terminal is just busy I guess
2007-03-04T11:13:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	try restarting and seeing if it happens again
2007-03-04T11:14:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	ok
2007-03-04T11:14:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	yep, same thing
2007-03-04T11:15:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	try doing ctrl-alt F2
2007-03-04T11:16:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	see if you have any consoles that have a login
2007-03-04T11:17:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	i can't even boot in recovery mode =(
2007-03-04T11:17:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	but the live cd worked well?
2007-03-04T11:17:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	yep 6.10
2007-03-04T11:18:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	actually i used the alternate install because of my lvm requirements
2007-03-04T11:18:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	well I don't know anything about lvm, and I've tried everything I know
2007-03-04T11:19:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	you might have a faulty install, or you have some hardware problem or quirk
2007-03-04T11:20:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	you could try installing DSL linux to see if another linux distro will work, but other than that... I don't know.
2007-03-04T11:20:00.000Z	gravemin1	eshaase	sorry I couldn't help more
2007-03-04T11:22:00.000Z	eshaase	gravemin1	its ok, thanks
