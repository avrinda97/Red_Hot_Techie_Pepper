2007-07-21T05:12:00.000Z	hexstar		what's the chmod # equivilent of drwxr-xr-x?
2007-07-21T05:13:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	755
2007-07-21T05:13:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	for folders that is a good permission, for files unless you need them to be executable like programs, I would go with 644
2007-07-21T05:15:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	by the way if you don't understand the numbering system it is binary: so 755 is 111 101 101, so that is rwx r-x r-x, if that makes sense, where there are zeros, you are not setting that permission and where the are ones you are
2007-07-26T14:33:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	couple of minutes, not quite
2007-07-26T14:34:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	maybe if you have 300 people associating and unassociating over and over to the same AP

2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	it isn't about time, it is dependent on how many packets you can get
2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	and to get enough packets in 10 minutes is very very unlikely
2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	fine :P
2007-07-26T14:37:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	I guess the zdnet guy got lucky then when he was able to park in a safeway parking lot and crack their wep wireless network in 15 minutes
2007-07-28T08:08:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	what do you mean by starter distro? does ubuntu get that because it requires very little user intervention to install and get working out of box?
2007-07-28T08:08:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	starter as in new to linux
2007-07-28T08:09:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	if you are starting out with linux if you will
2007-07-28T08:11:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	as in you hve to manually install the packages after install?
2007-07-28T08:12:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	right, it is like old school debian was (or still is?). Get the base installed, drops you to vc, you pacman the rest
2007-07-28T08:13:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	sounds like fun
2007-07-28T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	it depends on what you want, if you want a customized light distro that isn't loading everything needed or unneeded at boot, then those distros get annoying
2007-07-28T08:16:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	true
2007-07-28T08:19:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	I don't think it supports wildcard characters
2007-07-28T08:19:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	oh
2007-07-28T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	hexstar	that will locate a bunch of unnecessary stuff though
2007-07-28T09:55:00.000Z	hexstar	bruenig	there is a install script with knoppix, but no one really wants to install it :P
