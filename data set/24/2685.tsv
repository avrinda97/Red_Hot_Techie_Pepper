2008-09-28T20:18:00.000Z	csilk		barnie,  i dont know, it depends on your ISP
2008-09-28T20:18:00.000Z	csilk		all you can do is trun it off. wait one minute, then turn it on
2008-09-28T20:19:00.000Z	csilk		dreamedge,  rare???
2008-09-28T20:19:00.000Z	csilk		not really
2008-09-28T20:19:00.000Z	csilk		most people in the UK have combined ones
2008-09-28T20:19:00.000Z	csilk		i havent seen a modem for years
2008-09-28T20:19:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	 Alright - I guess I meant in the U.S.
2008-09-28T20:24:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	ah, no they don't
2008-09-28T20:26:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	no, one sec
2008-09-28T20:26:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	umm, that's only 10 routers... most are not meant for home users
2008-09-28T20:27:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	pretty sure they are meant for home users
2008-09-28T20:28:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	4/10 are under $100
2008-09-28T20:28:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	 yeah.. in that case, the USA is 10 years behind the UK in internet technology...
2008-09-28T20:29:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	Nah, I'm sure it is because here, the modems are provided by the ISP
2008-09-28T20:29:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	 here, the router/modem is provided by the isp
2008-09-28T20:30:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	It's possible they do the same thing here: i'm just saying most consumer routers that you can buy at a store isn't combined
2008-09-28T20:30:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	but whatever, it's not that important
2008-09-28T20:31:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	yeah.. not important, i find it strange though
2008-09-28T20:57:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	 i couldnt get pdt to work so i'm using phpeclipse
2008-09-28T20:58:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	hahaha yeah - I spent hours trying to get it to work in Eclipse 3.4 and still not really working - Crashes all the time
2008-09-28T20:59:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	I'm assuming phpecipse is still a plugin for eclipse though
2008-09-28T21:13:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	 i feel your pain
2008-09-28T22:17:00.000Z	csilk	dreamnid	ubuntu default runs apache as www-data
2008-09-28T22:17:00.000Z	dreamnid	csilk	right
