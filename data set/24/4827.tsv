2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		can someone answer my question that I asked please?
2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		I asked where can I get an ubuntu desktop (8.04 or 8.10) 64-bit alternate installer cd...
2008-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	Sephr		and I can't burn with this drive
2008-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	Sephr		only the iso to burn for youself
2008-09-25T00:45:00.000Z	Sephr		I also said I can't burn with this drive
2008-09-25T00:45:00.000Z	Sephr		WHERE?
2008-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	Sephr		the shipit.ubuntu.com site doesn't offer the alternate installer
2008-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	Sephr		arrrghh: can you please actually give me a link to the page where I can get the 64-bit alternate installer?
2008-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Sephr	http://releases.ubuntu.com/hardy/
2008-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	Sephr		omg noone listens
2008-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	Sephr		I'll say it all in one thing: I can't burn cd/dvds with my drive, so where can I get the ubuntu 8.04 or 8.10 64-bit alternate installer CD or DVD??
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	Sephr		I never said I was going to download it
2008-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	Sephr	nucco	I had no intentions of downloading it because neither of my computers can burn dvds
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr	nucco	I already said what I want
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Sephr	You ask someone nicely to burn it for you
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr		everyone: shipit only gives me the NORMAL x86 and 64 bit dvd options
2008-09-25T00:49:00.000Z	Sephr		no alt cd
2008-09-25T00:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Sephr	The alternate download is a 700MB CD, not a DVD. Can your systems burn CDs?
2008-09-25T00:53:00.000Z	Sephr		btw, why doesn't the normal install disk support RAID drives?
2008-09-25T00:53:00.000Z	Sephr		seems so stupid to make that alternate-install disc only
2008-09-25T00:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Sephr	not enough space on the CD
2008-09-25T00:54:00.000Z	Sephr		how huge would the drivers for raid drives be?
2008-09-25T00:54:00.000Z	Sephr		they can't be over 10MB
2008-09-25T00:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Sephr	It's not the drivers, it's the installer infrastructure and support libraries required to handle it. The CD team bust a gut trying to fit everything in, and for Desktop usage they have to contend with a bootable system-on-disk as well as the installation requirements.
