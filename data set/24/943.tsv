2010-12-16T07:31:00.000Z	mac_		Hey rom
2010-12-16T07:31:00.000Z	mac_		Can I just install ubuntu?
2010-12-16T07:31:00.000Z	mac_		if grub is corrupted
2010-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	mac_		actually reinstall to be more precise
2010-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	that will usually fix a grub problem, as it will install a new grub w/ the new install (thus overwriting the old one)
2010-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	thats no problem
2010-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	the thing is I have a windows partition too
2010-12-16T07:32:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	will it harm that?
2010-12-16T07:33:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	well how is your current install set u?
2010-12-16T07:33:00.000Z	mac_		half windows half ubuntu]
2010-12-16T07:33:00.000Z	mac_		well actually more windows
2010-12-16T07:33:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	ok, but it's not a wubi install, right?
2010-12-16T07:33:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	I have no idea
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	mac_		KM0201:
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	hold on
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	no it was done through ubuntu
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	it was not installed in windows
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	it was done by the live cd
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	ok, then just install over your old install.
2010-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	but it will ask to set the partitions again right?
2010-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	yes, you'll have to do "advanced" partitioning to overwrite the old ones
2010-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	mac_	KM0201	well wouldn't this put the windows installation at risk
2010-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	KM0201		no.
2010-12-16T07:39:00.000Z	KM0201	mac_	type this w/o quotes.. "/join #km0201"
