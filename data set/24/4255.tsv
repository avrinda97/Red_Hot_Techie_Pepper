2007-05-28T06:59:00.000Z	soumou		hello
2007-05-28T07:00:00.000Z	soumou		sorry, i was just checking that i was connected
2007-05-28T07:01:00.000Z	soumou		is anyone availble to answer questions related to installing ubuntu to a 4th hard drive on a system that alreay contains a raid 5 array of win xp
2007-05-28T07:02:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	impossible, better get a new PC
2007-05-28T07:04:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	I don't really know! I just wanted to say something, a straight response...
2007-05-28T07:22:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	sorry, but some problems are out of our reach, keep asking every 15 minutes
2007-05-28T07:25:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	now, it is nice to rephrase the question... now that you mention it, have you tried simply formatting that 4th drive and see what happens?
2007-05-28T07:27:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	by the way, use the full nickname, otherwise you'll be talking to other people
2007-05-28T07:28:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	in that case, unplug all disks, and run the Live CD only with that one you wish to erase/format
2007-05-28T07:29:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	 i have already tried that
2007-05-28T07:30:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	place it as master or in the sata 0 port, you have to try all that, also maybe reconfiguring the BIOS. Most bios have some utility to autodetect disks.
2007-05-28T08:08:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	Knoppix is also based on Debian, it has options to deactivate hardware detection and has tons of programs that run from the CD. You can load the entire image to RAM memory 1GB. It is useful to have the CD around.
2007-05-28T08:10:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	for some reason in firefox i am getting errors in tryiing to download from here:  http://content.emule-project.net/view.php?pid=960 ... the error says "firefox doesn't kow how to open this address, because  protocol (ed2k)isn't associated with any program" ....... any advice?
2007-05-28T08:14:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	you can download Knoppix from HTTP/FTP or from torrent, it is easier that way. I'm not sure what you are trying.
2007-05-28T08:16:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	i don't have a bittorrent client on this laptop right now, what is the appropriate ftp site to go to with filezilla?
2007-05-28T08:16:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	eh?  just go to the Knoppix page, there are tons of mirrors. With a fast connection it will take you like 30 minutes.
2007-05-28T08:27:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	that is not a fair question... assume guys always!
2007-05-28T08:21:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	last time there were only kazillion... anyway, choose one that has the size of a CD...
2007-05-28T08:22:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	the DE means Deutsch, so probably check one saying EN
2007-05-28T08:27:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	besides, what makes you think i am a guy and not a girl with a hot box?
2007-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	what is girlfriend?
2007-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	i still got 23 mins of knoppix download to go and research the answer to your question ..........
2007-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	vox754	soumou	save it, besides #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-05-28T08:33:00.000Z	soumou	vox754	nobody over there right now
