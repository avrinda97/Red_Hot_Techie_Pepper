2006-06-25T11:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	richee	I know Thunderbird will pick up the new key once you make it, Tb uses it's own ui for that and you can use that new key in email. Not sure, but I would think Evolution would be the same and I know kmail does it too
2006-06-25T11:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	richee	Seahorse is a nice gui app for managing keys
