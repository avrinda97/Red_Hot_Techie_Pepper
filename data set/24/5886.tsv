2010-03-26T11:25:00.000Z	Curly_Q		How can an attacker know the username behind a router and firewall on a private intranet?
2010-03-26T11:26:00.000Z	Curly_Q		I tried to ssh within root   <root>@<hostname>  permissions is still denied.
2010-03-26T11:28:00.000Z	Curly_Q		All I want to do is to copy and paste with a ssh gui to /usr/share/apache2/default-site/
2010-03-26T11:29:00.000Z	Curly_Q		User permission is denied.
2010-03-26T11:29:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Root permission is denied.
2010-03-26T11:30:00.000Z	Curly_Q		What is the sudo command for that?
2010-03-26T11:31:00.000Z	Curly_Q		What I am doing is working with 192.168.0.*** to SSH into Kubuntu box. I can see every file and directory but cannot copy and paste from Windows to Kubuntu.
2010-03-26T11:32:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	What are you trying to copy and paste from Windows to Kubuntu?
2010-03-26T11:32:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	What client are you using on Windows?
2010-03-26T11:33:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	my simplest suggestion, copy as a regular user, use the terminal and sudo to copy as a root to your required directory
2010-03-26T11:34:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	How comfortable are you with the terminal?
2010-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	no no, I meant executing terminal commands. For example, if I told you do a "sudo mv /home/Curly_Q/copied_stuff /usr/share/apache2/default-site/" would you understand?
2010-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	Because by default no user has permissions to login remotely to add files into /usr/share
2010-03-26T11:48:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	Somehow I don't think that's going to help you. Your default account is already allowed sudo permissions, so I doubt adding it to sudoers is going to help you
2010-03-26T11:54:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	If you login directly as root, you do have permissions to write into any folder
2010-03-26T11:54:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	What exactly do you mean "gui copy and paste" .. What GUI are you using exactly?
2010-03-26T11:59:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	There's something still missing in your description. Somehow I doubt it's a permissions problem
2010-03-26T12:00:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	SSH Tectia is the SCP client you are using, correct?
2010-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	May I offer a suggestion? I went to SSH Tectia's website, and it doesn't seem to be free. Download WinSCP, http://winscp.net/eng/download.php use it to login as root (and not as user) to your Linux machine .. you should see 2 file system trees side by side
2010-03-26T12:02:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	ah well .. just that I use winscp and I don't seem to have a problem transferring files as root to my Ubuntu box .. I don't know how Tectia works, so I can't really provide any good troubleshooting options
2010-03-26T12:05:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	If Tectia was free, I would have tried to install it and seen how it is .. as it is not I really can't do anything other than suggest a free alternative
2010-03-26T12:07:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	Well all I can say is give the portable WinSCP, you won't have to install anything
2010-03-26T12:07:00.000Z	harisund	Curly_Q	err I meant give the portable WinSCP a try .. it has a very intuitive user interface too
