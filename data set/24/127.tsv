2012-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar		i think my upgrade installation of 12.04 got botched.  at the point in the install process where it said "we're going to do a post install cleanup now.  close all your open apps so you don't lose anything" i did an alt-tab to see if i actually had any other apps open, and the install window just ... disappeared.  since i didn't know how to even get a terminal at that point, i hit reset.  it...
2012-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar		...seems to be running ok except that hibernate is hit or miss.  any way to repair an installation or at least this issue?
2012-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	to get a terminal, ctrl-alt-t
2012-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	just run updates from launcher, do a check & install everything.
2012-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	you can also get a terminal by pressing ctrl-alt-f2 -- you'll need to press ctrl-alt-f7 to get back to xwindows.
2012-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar	nydel	hmm i think i have done that a few times (this botched install was a few weeks ago).  i update maybe once a week
2012-05-31T09:15:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	what goes wrong during suspension, you said suspend was hit-or-miss?
2012-05-31T09:16:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	as in you can't get the system to wake up?
2012-05-31T09:17:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar	nydel	no, as in i tell it to suspend or hibernate and the process hangs.  i just have a blank screen on ubunte (with a blinking cursor) or on windows i get login screen and it says "preparing to suspend" forever
2012-05-31T09:18:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	this might be a defective hardware issue, as it's happening on the good OS & the bad one.
2012-05-31T09:18:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	i'm just joking, windows is a fine os.
2012-05-31T09:19:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	best i can say is to avoid hibernation/suspension.
2012-05-31T09:20:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	i'm sorry your upgrade experience wasn't as pleasant as it should have been
2012-05-31T09:20:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	i suggest backing up your grub.conf
2012-05-31T09:21:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	did you check the forums.ubuntu.com to see if this problem has occurred for others? it sounds very frustrating.

2012-05-31T09:24:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	you can search the forums for keyword "suspend" & there are a lot of threads. sorry it's not very possible to help with this issue from here, but someone may have already figured it out.
2012-05-31T09:25:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar	nydel	thx will look around.  again the issue only popped up after botched upgrade and as i said subsequent updates did not seem to fix it.
2012-05-31T09:25:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	good luck. also, next time you're doing an upgrade, make sure everything is killed. that will increase the likeliness of a clean upgrade.
2012-05-31T09:25:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	it's not your fault, but linux can be fragile, just as any OS can - we have to be very careful when upgrading. i've killed many a system because i just HAD to check my email while upgrading.
2012-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	i would think of the window switcher as an application & alt-tab as launching it.
2012-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	but you're right, it shouldn't have made the install window vanish.
2012-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	nydel	UberschallSamsar	trust me i & many others are on the front lines every day trying to keep that from happening, so please feel very heard on that issue.
2012-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	UberschallSamsar	nydel	appreciated
