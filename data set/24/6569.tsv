2008-09-13T16:10:00.000Z	windmill		what is the best way to share files betwwen two ubuntu machines?
2008-09-13T16:12:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	use a VPN
2008-09-13T16:13:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	NFS is intended to be used in a setting where *you* control the IPs
2008-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	I suppose I do control IP addesses on the local network, it still seems like a poor security model
2008-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	it's not a security model
2008-09-13T16:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	NFS is not intended to be secure.
2008-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	if you want to secure it, you can use a VPN
2008-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	I don't really understand when you say VPN I'll google it, my understanding of vpn was that you could connect two networks across an unsecured link (the Internet)
2008-09-13T16:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	yes
2008-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	but it also does authentication
2008-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	if you want to secure NFS, you can use VPN and get authentication
2008-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	oh... sounds complicated
2008-09-13T16:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	it is, a bit
2008-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	you can also just configure your NFS server to only serve things to trusted IP addresses and networks
2008-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	it's adequate in a local network.
2008-09-13T16:19:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	I'm probably beeing paranoid but if you have one machine on the local network that becomes compromised then all the security goes down the toilet
2008-09-13T16:21:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	I think I might give sshfs a go
2008-09-13T16:23:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	it seems like there is currently no good solution to share files between two computers over a network which is crazy
2008-09-13T16:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	there are two good solutions
2008-09-13T16:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	NFS is a good solution
2008-09-13T16:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	and so is CIFS
2008-09-13T16:24:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	yeah I suppose at least CIFS has password based permissions
2008-09-13T16:24:00.000Z	Chousuke	windmill	it's not very secure by default though.
2008-09-13T16:26:00.000Z	windmill	Chousuke	with NFS if someone gets control of one of the machines on your network what's to stop then changing the IP and getting access to any nfs share intended for any other computer on the network?
