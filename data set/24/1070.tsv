2010-08-02T07:57:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	it wasn't successfull with the install
2010-08-02T07:57:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	according to his update regarding /dev/sdc and not /dev/sdc5 - it was
2010-08-02T07:58:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	how did I miss that?
2010-08-02T07:58:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	<spine> ok, if i do it with /dev/sdc there are no errors
2010-08-02T07:59:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	lol, I missed that!
2010-08-02T08:02:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	if he selected bios boot menu (F8 typically) to boot specific device it will typically rename the devices
2010-08-02T08:03:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	really?  does that cause any issues for installing grub?
2010-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	UID should work around it if its still enabled
2010-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	then again he said he had uid errors
2010-08-02T08:04:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	I remember when UID came out, I hated it, I loved the simple sda5 stuff
2010-08-02T08:05:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	it was simpler, but I can see with the technology why they went to uid stuff
2010-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	spine, i'd also do the chroot so you can run update-grub
2010-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	yes, that is what I was thinking
2010-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	I would think since the installation worked, we just need to update it
2010-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	ok
2010-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	I scipted out my chrooting so it is documented for me. :)
2010-08-02T08:20:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	he may need to pull up the drive from livecd in gparted to see if it complains
2010-08-02T08:21:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	like perhaps there are drive errors, or partition errors?
2010-08-02T08:22:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	yes expecially if an resizing and partitioning had occured just prior
2010-08-02T08:22:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	seems odd to me that it shows sda1 as unknown, unless it is a hidden restoration partition
2010-08-02T08:23:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	i've seen them on dell laptops
2010-08-02T08:23:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	I'm no good at partition table restoratoin, I have messed with that before.
2010-08-02T08:24:00.000Z	venger	shane-laptop	my idea of restoration would be to blow it away.  i think he would at least spot check for going and reinstalling on the current scheme
2010-08-02T08:36:00.000Z	shane-laptop	venger	wow, sfdisk is like fdisk on steroids. :)
