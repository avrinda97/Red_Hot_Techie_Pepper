2005-04-17T09:36:00.000Z	fsapo		how do i know if my firewall if activated or not???
2005-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	your firewall is part of the kernel already
2005-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	so how can i open a port??
2005-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	it's tricky without help. two helper solutions are firestarter and shorewall
2005-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	by default, all ports are open though
2005-04-17T09:38:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	dont have any :(
2005-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	but if you don't have a server listening on a port, obviously you'll get "connection refused" which is as good as a firewall
2005-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	the firewall configuration though will help you control who can access what servers
2005-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	but i have a shoutcast server on this port =/
2005-04-17T09:40:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	i'm not familiar with shoutcast, but what port does it use
2005-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	it uses the por 8000
2005-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	have you tried firestarter?
2005-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	just tried it
2005-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	disabled my firewall and now i m not getting errors
2005-04-17T09:42:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	just need somebody to test it :)
2005-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	happy to
2005-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	thanx :)
2005-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	i ll try creating some rules just to some ports
2005-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	ok, tell me what ports to try against and an IP addr when you're ready
2005-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	or we can go to a private channel if you prefer
2005-04-17T09:56:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	my firewall may be blocking this dcc thing
2005-04-17T09:57:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	sorry about that
2005-04-17T09:59:00.000Z	fsapo	ipcopnewbie	np do u have icq?
2005-04-17T09:59:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	fsapo	sorry, i don't
