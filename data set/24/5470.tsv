2006-07-11T13:55:00.000Z	RShadow		any other ideas?
2006-07-11T05:56:00.000Z	RShadow		what packages can I find the md5 and sha1 tools?
2006-07-11T05:58:00.000Z	RShadow		speaking of which.. is it possible to preform a search with apt-get? this is driving me nuts (/me really really really misses emerge)
2006-07-11T05:58:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	then go back to Gentoo :P
2006-07-11T05:59:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	unfourtuntly Genoo isn't provided where I'm hosted.. or I would.. I love Ubuntu as a desktop but I'm bangin my head against the wall trying to use it as a server
2006-07-11T05:59:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	what are your options?
2006-07-11T05:59:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	strictly Ubuntu?
2006-07-11T06:00:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	ubuntu and debian woody.. I choose ubuntu.. well and fedora but I can't stand fedora..
2006-07-11T06:00:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	no Slackware/NetBSD/FreeBSD??
2006-07-11T06:00:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	hmm.. good choice, but I would suggest Debian if you could get the testing version of it.
2006-07-11T06:00:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	nope. all though that would be a big learning curve for me anyways.. last BSD I used was BSDI almost six years ago and never used slack
2006-07-11T06:01:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	Well, I think Ubuntu out of all those were probably your best choice, good job. :)
2006-07-11T06:02:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	ya.. I thought so too.. but I really don't like the way apt works.. IMHO when I remove something it should remove everything and when I install something it should install everything.. I had to ditch snort because I can't get it to install the whole package
2006-07-11T06:02:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	Come visit me at #frozenthrone, or #penguinslair, on irc.oftc.net :) we got lots of very intelligent people if ye' ever need assistance.
2006-07-11T06:02:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	which is kind of good for me because now I stumbled across ossec which actualy looks like a better package
2006-07-11T06:02:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	Thanks for the offer, I will most surely keep it in mind
2006-07-11T06:02:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	Ubuntu has it's flaws, but it is a decent operating system, imho.
2006-07-11T06:03:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	ya, IMHO its the best binary distro out there.. I'm just spoiled with Gentoo :D
2006-07-11T06:03:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	anytime, most of the time, there isn't many people in here to help, so I try to recruit to my channels because we have tons and tons of smart people... dont' mean to hold ye' still, good luck with your Operating System.
2006-07-11T06:04:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	I have Gentoo on my Laptop and my 4 harddrives on my Desktop computer, I won't ever go to anything else...
2006-07-11T06:04:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	I mean to me.. It kinds of sucks compiling everything, but I just can't get paste emerge.. I think its 100% the best package management solution... other distro's should adobt it.. it really makes sense
2006-07-11T06:05:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	that it does.
2006-07-11T06:05:00.000Z	RShadow	PyroticShadow	anyways.. back to setting up my server.. got your server and channels bookmarked.. I'll give them a join a little bit later
2006-07-11T06:06:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	RShadow	Ok, Have fun, Take care, and Good luck, if I'm not responding in the channel, just idle there, and PM me and I'll get back to you when I can.
