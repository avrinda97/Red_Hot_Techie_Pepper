2008-09-01T23:42:00.000Z	myk_robinson		me again.. how do i pass the boot option acpi=off when booting from the hard drive
2008-09-01T23:42:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	permanentlyu or temporarily?
2008-09-01T23:43:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	at the grub menu, hit 'e' and then you can manually edit the grub entry.  If you want 'temporarily permanent' (it'll last, but not if you upgrade your kernel) you can edit menu.lst manually and add it to the end of your kernel line.
2008-09-01T23:43:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	i think i may have already done it correctly, then. How can i tell from inside the OS whether i idsabled acpi?
2008-09-01T23:45:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	I have no idea. I'm sure its possible though
2008-09-01T23:46:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	dont know if you answered me, lost connection again.. Guess acpi doesnt matter nayway...
2009-06-29T04:58:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	What are you trying to configure?
2009-06-29T04:58:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	I want to use /home/user/Public/WWW as the root, with subfolders inside for sites I am working on for testing before uploading to a real webserver
2009-06-29T04:59:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	Does it hvave to be root? or can it be domain/~user/?  since that's already set up actually.
2009-06-29T04:59:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	for example, /home/user/Public/WWW/siteA   /home/user/Public/WWW/siteB
2009-06-29T04:59:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	I meant as the root directory for Apache, not root user
2009-06-29T04:59:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	Righ, I know.
2009-06-29T05:00:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	Would a subfolder for your username be sufficient? or do you actually need the webroot?
2009-06-29T05:00:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	not really sure. I have been doing a little reading and may have gotten confused. What do you recommend? I want to use a directory that does not require Root privileges
2009-06-29T05:01:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	If you put stuff in ~/public_html/ (and make it readable by the user www-data) then it'll show up at http://whatever/~username/
2009-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	This is just a test machine and stuff?
2009-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	yes, on my laptop, just want to be able to test sites before uploading
2009-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	alright, then what we'll do is simply do some permission-magic to make it so you don't need to use sudo to throw stuff into /var/www/
2009-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	The easiest way to do it is to add yourself to the www-data group (sudo adduser username www-data) and then sudo chmod g+w /var/www
2009-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	You'll have to log back in for the group addition to take effect, but you'll then be able to write to /var/www as your regular user
2009-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	you mind if I make this private so i can keep up for a sec?
2009-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	myk_robinson	I don't mind repeating or whatnot, but sure.
2009-06-29T05:36:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	got PHP problems.. PHP is enabled, but not working for the /var/www/Church directory. Firefox asks where to save the file
2009-06-29T05:36:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Flannel	I placed a PHP info test file in /var/www and it returns the PHP Version 5.2.6 information
