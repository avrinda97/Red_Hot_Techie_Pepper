2010-04-25T22:33:00.000Z	mark1		can you make a folder hidden in linux ?
2010-04-25T22:35:00.000Z	mark1		thanks guys
2010-04-25T22:35:00.000Z	delac	mark1	put dot . in front of the filename or foldername. however ls -al and nautilus with 'show hidden files' will show the file or folder

2010-04-25T22:53:00.000Z	mark1	delac	that seems like the right idea, but im gonna have to get more used to linux before i try that cause i dont really get what they saying lol, anyway ill keep the link and have a look after a few weeks
2010-04-25T22:53:00.000Z	delac	mark1	well that's not really verry hard
2010-04-25T22:54:00.000Z	delac	mark1	only one command if i got it right
2010-04-25T22:54:00.000Z	delac	mark1	just open the terminal and go to the folder in the usb-stick that has the file
2010-04-25T22:55:00.000Z	delac	mark1	and then issue the command: mattrib +h filename
2010-04-25T22:55:00.000Z	delac	mark1	at least i think it works like that :) I haven't tried myself...
2010-04-25T22:57:00.000Z	mark1	delac	ok let me give it a try!
