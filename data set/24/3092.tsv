2008-05-02T22:34:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	this is gutsy or hardy
2008-05-02T22:34:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	Now you lost me
2008-05-02T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	which version of ubuntu 7.10 or 8.04
2008-05-02T22:35:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	which app? amarok gtkpod or what
2008-05-02T22:35:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	amarok
2008-05-02T22:37:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	quit amarok; (not to system tray fully quit); attach ipod; open amarok; configure device in amarok settings; transfer files , etc.; remove (safely in amarok) then umount from destop (rioght click) done
2008-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	Still doesn't work. amarok doesn't find my iPod
2008-05-02T22:42:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	you followed all my steps? what exact ones did not work-->please specify
2008-05-02T22:44:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	I opened options in amarok, tried autodetect device, didn't find anything. Added the device (as Apple iPod media device), pressed the "connect" button under the devices section
2008-05-02T22:44:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	Then I get "No mounted iPod found".
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	If I instead select "Generic audio player" and connect (same path) I get the list of the dir's and files on the iPod
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	the ipod was first disconnected? or you did this with the ipod connected and amarok already open-->try gtkpod and rhythmbox and report any errors you get there as well
2008-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	I ejected and then attached again
2008-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	It works in rhythmbox (but I used amarok last time I run linux and love it)
2008-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	then try the method that worked and try transferring some files to it
2008-05-02T22:47:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	Bah, it's slow loading more than 10000 songs from the ipod :(
2008-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	it sees the ipod? good news then
2008-05-02T22:48:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	It sees the ipod, loads the songs and I can listen to them using rhythmbox, but I would like to use amarok if possible
2008-05-02T22:49:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	did you not say that amarok could them when used as generic? try that if you must though sounds less than ideal imo
2008-05-02T22:50:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	No, the folders were listed that way. But the playlists etc doesn't work and then there's no point in using amarok
2008-05-02T22:50:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	no probs with amarok and ipods here-->that is strange
2008-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	for hardy sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
2008-05-07T18:18:00.000Z	bazhang	xintron	the fwcutter does not do it? what have you tried and what errors have you gotten
2008-05-07T18:19:00.000Z	xintron	bazhang	I tried this way https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4318_%5BAirForce_One_54g%5D
