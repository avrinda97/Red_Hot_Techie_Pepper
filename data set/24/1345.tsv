2010-02-28T06:26:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	people still use Reiser after what happened?
2010-02-28T06:27:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	apparently :)
2010-02-28T06:27:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	he must have lots of time to code now!
2010-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	you might try the -proposed repository, to see if there's a glitch in the package
2010-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	how would i do that?
2010-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	look here, the "selective upgrading" part: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed
2010-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	I am more of a stable release kind of a guy
2010-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	hence the selective upgrade part -- you don't have to upgrade any more than you want to.
2010-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	you think if I downgraded my libgtk2.18.3-1ubuntu2 to a name closer to  2.18.3-1 could help?
2010-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	this is the dep error I get:   libgtk2.0-dev: Depends: libgtk2.0-0 (= 2.18.3-1) but 2.18.3-1ubuntu2 is to be installed
2010-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	it might, yes. the latest version of libgtk-2.0-dev in the repo might not be the same version as the latest libgtk-2.0
2010-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	if that's the case, you could a) try rolling libgtk-2.0 back to match libgtk-2.0-dev, or you could check -proposed to see if there's a version of libgtk-2.0-dev that matches your libgtk-2.0
2010-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	i just wish it'd work like it is supposed to as opposed to me jumping thorugh all sorts of flaming hoops I'd prefer not getting burned by any of this later on it all
2010-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	as in I'd like the dev package of gtk installed that is supposed to go with my release nothing more
2010-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	I understand, but I have no control over that :)
2010-02-28T07:01:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	wait, do you have karmic-updates enabled?
2010-02-28T07:01:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	how can I check?
2010-02-28T07:02:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	System > Administration > Software Sources, under the "Updates" tab
2010-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	when I sudo apt-get update I see a lot of karmic this that and the other things
2010-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	come to look at it every line is karmic something or other
2010-02-28T07:05:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	the reason I'm asking is because karmic was shipped with version 2.18.3-1 of gtk and gtk-dev. the updated versions in the karmic-updates repo are 2.18.3-1ubuntu2.2, which is similar to the version in your error
2010-02-28T07:06:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	despite your 13 attempts to update and check your sources so far, it really does seem like you're having a source issue
2010-02-28T07:06:00.000Z	pfred1	brjann	yes i have no line that says karmic updates
2010-02-28T07:07:00.000Z	brjann	pfred1	okay, it seems like that's the problem. somehow libgtk2.0-0 was updated to version 2.18.3-1ubuntu2, but since you don't have karmic-updates enabled, apt can't find a version of libgtk2.0-dev to match it.
