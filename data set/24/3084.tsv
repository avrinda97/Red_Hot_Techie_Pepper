2008-05-03T11:57:00.000Z	damntourists		Ok, so I just installed 8.04, and I got it to boot up, and install 2 updates.... then I installed one of the restricted drivers for my video card, and when i go to reboot the computer, it just goes to a black screen instead of the logon screen. Any advice anyone?
2008-05-03T11:58:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 - what video card?
2008-05-03T11:58:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	ah shoot, hold on. I think it's an ATI Radeon x1950, but let me double check
2008-05-03T12:00:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	yeah, ATI Radeon x1950 Pro
2008-05-03T12:00:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 go to ATI site, and find what cards the 8.4 driver supports
2008-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	ok, hold on.
2008-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 --- wait
2008-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	what's up
2008-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 ----- some ppl with ATI are having difficulty with Restricted drivers enabled
2008-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	any way i can disable it, without having to reinstall ubuntu?
2008-05-03T12:02:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 except you can't get into the desktop
2008-05-03T12:02:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	yeah, but i'm sure i can get to a full screen terminal, no?
2008-05-03T12:02:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 - now yer on to it
2008-05-03T12:03:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 a round about way.. is xorg.conf.. in /etc
2008-05-03T12:03:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	yeah, i know, but how do i get to a full screen terminal? last time i just had to press shift and backspace or something similar
2008-05-03T12:05:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 --- fglrx might not even work.. but the generic system drivers will let you run Compiz
2008-05-03T12:05:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	ok, i just need to find a way to get to the terminal lol
2008-05-03T12:14:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 --- got that far, good go
2008-05-03T12:14:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 - also see #compiz-Fusion
2008-05-03T12:56:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 ----- follow along what crdlb  is doing, but don't do it..
2008-05-03T12:56:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	thanks
2008-05-03T13:02:00.000Z	drivetrax	damntourists	 - copy xorg.conf - as backup
2008-05-03T13:02:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	yeah i wish i did that before the restricted drivers
2008-05-03T23:40:00.000Z	damntourists	drivetrax	thanks, hopefully this new method works. we'll see. i'd just like to replace windows and have a better performing desktop.
