2007-05-31T08:31:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	an error message
2007-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	ata is your IDE controler
2007-05-31T08:33:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	no the controller probably has
2007-05-31T08:37:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	what are you trying to do? and either you tell us full error messages or it's worthless. and use a pastebin
2007-05-31T08:38:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	I just did
2007-05-31T08:41:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	I asked you a question. answer that first
2007-05-31T08:42:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	what hardware do you have? what chipset?
2007-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	chipset. not cpu
2007-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	the chips you use on your motherboard
2007-05-31T08:53:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	I cannot tell you anymore unless you give me the info I asked
2007-05-31T08:53:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	I am not psychic
2007-05-31T08:54:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	what chipset? intel, sis, ati, nvidia?
2007-05-31T08:54:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	ubuntu.com
2007-05-31T08:58:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	i865 chipset with integrated graphics. (asrock mobo)
2007-05-31T08:58:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	ubuntu should install fine on it
2007-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	sounds like hardware. does another OS work fine on the disk? either bad disk controller or bad harddisk possibly
2007-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	what ubuntu version? maybe try anbother version
2007-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	and paste the exact and full error message
2007-05-31T09:03:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	then write it down when you are actually there
2007-06-03T10:51:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	I dunno if you can with the installer, but you can always change that after install: simply edit your fstab
2007-06-03T10:51:00.000Z	wols_	soyporti	simply a single small file edit
