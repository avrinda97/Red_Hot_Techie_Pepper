2010-11-14T16:07:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, did you have try to restore it on a other location?
2010-11-14T16:07:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I get the same message: "No files found in archive - nothing restored."
2010-11-14T16:08:00.000Z	Sibo	anon	Mmmm
2010-11-14T16:08:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	but there is nothing wrong with the hard drive that contains the files (3 GB in total).
2010-11-14T16:11:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, did you switched from Ubuntu version?
2010-11-14T16:12:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I'm still using Ubuntu 10.10. The version of Deja Dup is 16
2010-11-14T16:20:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, im searching for you and try to replicate the problem, try in the mean time the gnome IRC channel
2010-11-14T16:20:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	thanks. I appreciate it.
2010-11-14T16:33:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	now Deja Dup says "Restoring", but does not give any details.
2010-11-14T16:35:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I think I will install the newest version from https://launchpad.net/~deja-dup-team/+archive/ppa
2010-11-14T16:36:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, i could not reproduce the problem with 10.04 (Sorry, runs the LTS version) And never used deja-dup ever before. What i saw is that Deja-dup duplicity used. Maybe you can restore your archive with in de cli with duplicity. Try to restore it to a temp directory.
2010-11-14T16:39:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, newer versions has bug fixes. But if it not working try to try it with duplicity.
2010-11-14T16:40:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I'll try to do it with duplicity. Thanks for your help
2010-11-14T16:41:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, and i don't know if its working. Duplicity says that you can restore a difftar archive manually by using tar and then cp, rdiff, and rm as nacessary.
2010-11-14T16:41:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, i dont know if you have a difftar archive.
2010-11-14T16:42:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I have it. But it's encrypted, so I would have to decrypt it first/
2010-11-14T16:50:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	I did "duplicity file:///media/hard_drive/ ~/Desktop/", and now I have a new directory on ~/Desktop called "anon", that contains all my files. :-)
2010-11-14T16:51:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, Cool ;)
2010-11-14T16:52:00.000Z	Sibo		Anon, your the best.
2010-11-14T16:52:00.000Z	anon	Sibo	thanks for your help
2010-11-14T16:52:00.000Z	Sibo	anon	no problem
