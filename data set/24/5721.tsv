2007-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	do you still get gdm (the login manager) when you restart X?
2007-02-28T17:53:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	as in does it ask me to log in? no... but it never did.
2007-02-28T17:53:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	are you on ubuntu at all?
2007-02-28T17:55:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	I dont really know where to draw the line between a dist and a window manager...  I can get the ubuntu interface up by running "exec gnome-session"
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	but while im runnning e, i cant see any of the files which are regularly on my desktop
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	how do you start X when you boot?
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	sorry but what is X?
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	the GUI server that controls your graphics card -- the layer under the window manager.
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	have you got the ubuntu-desktop package installed?
2007-02-28T06:00:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	yes. I installed E by choosing the package in package-manager
2007-02-28T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	when you boot your computer, what's the first thing you get to type into? (It should normally be a login screen)
2007-02-28T06:05:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	I must have disabled the login screen a while ago becuase i never had that even when I did have the ubuntu-desck top showing. now I just see the enlightenment desktop
2007-02-28T06:05:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	can you do a 'sudo update-rc.d gdm defaults', then close all applications and hit Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2007-02-28T06:08:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	ok that time I got a ubuntu login...
2007-02-28T06:09:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	at the login screen, you should be able to select a standard gnome session, with metacity as the wm
2007-02-28T06:09:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	ok that time I got a ubuntu login...
2007-02-28T06:10:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	ubuntu uses metacity?
2007-02-28T06:10:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	yes
2007-02-28T06:13:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	wow, Cheers!
2007-02-28T06:14:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	gnome uses metacity?
2007-02-28T06:14:00.000Z	adrigen	soundray	thanks you so much
2007-02-28T06:14:00.000Z	soundray	adrigen	pleasure
