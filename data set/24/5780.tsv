2012-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	MrWizard		Using 11.10 on an averatec 2500, anytime I start a video in VLC the sound is all garbled and riddled with crackling and feedback...this corrects itself if I simply open the sound settings menu, but I'd like to find a cause and permanent solution for this if possible...any ideas?
2012-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Does this happen with all video formats or just one format? Does this happen with other video players?
2012-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	happens with any video format (have tried .avi wma wmv mp*'s mkvs, pretty much anything) and with any video player (vlc is simply my main one)
2012-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Does this happen with other OSs on the same hardware?
2012-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	No sir, and didn't happen with previous version of 'Buntu, just this latest one...its not even a big problem, just a bit of an annoyance, but I haven't been able to pin the cause down
2012-02-27T07:58:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Have you tried changing the audio out module in vlc?
2012-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	yes, i completely lose sound on any settings other than default, ALSA, or pulse and the issue still persists with those settings
2012-02-27T08:02:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Anything funny in dmesg?
2012-02-27T08:02:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Actually, pastebin dmesg and we'll look at it.
2012-02-27T08:04:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	will do but give me some time since i have no idea how to do that (feels like an idiot)  looking it up now
2012-02-27T08:05:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Open a terminal, type dmesg, and hit enter. Then copy and paste everything that appears into pastebin.com.
2012-02-27T08:05:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	thankyou, one moment

2012-02-27T08:08:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	sorry again, thankyou for your patience
2012-02-27T08:08:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	No problems. Thank you for choosing a good nick.
2012-02-27T08:17:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	I have to get going, but I may have a lead for you.
2012-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	any leads would be appreciated
2012-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	According to your dmesg, you have an ALC888 audio chip. Users have reported that when the PCM volume is set to 0, crackling sounds can be heard over the intended audio. Opening the mixer resets the PCM volume and fixes this problem.

2012-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	I would try to get someone to help you set up your system so that your PCM volume will get set to an appropriate value on startup.
2012-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	MrWizard	erpo	thankyou for your help, i'll look into it, and have a good evening/morning/afternoon
2012-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	erpo	MrWizard	Thanks. Have a good day.
