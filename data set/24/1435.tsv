2012-10-17T19:54:00.000Z	ashwin18		Hi. I've screwed up my bootloader by deleting the ubuntu partition and using bootsect under windows. Now i'm getting a 'invalid partition' and a 'grub rescue' prompt at startup. I need to boot into windows 7 again.
2012-10-17T19:55:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	you can boot to liveCD and chroot to the installed OS and fix grub
2012-10-17T19:56:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	thanks, but my optical drive doesnt work. I installed ubuntu using a flash drive, but that's empty now since I have the iso file on my hard drive. Is there a way to simply 'remove' grub and let bootmgr do it's thing?
2012-10-17T19:57:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	you can use a liveUSB too, its the same difference.

2012-10-17T20:00:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	I dont have the image, and I can't download it atm since I'm using a public computer
2012-10-17T20:01:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	how did you install Ubuntu? Did you use Wubi?
2012-10-17T20:02:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	I downloaded the iso from the official site, used something from pendrivelinux.com to put it on the flash drive, booted from the flash drive, started the live version, ran the setup, and selected the first option which said 'keep windows 7 and install ubuntu side by side' (i'm paraphrasing)
2012-10-17T20:02:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	thats cool, you are understood :)
2012-10-17T20:02:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	thanks :)
2012-10-17T20:02:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	do you have your windows CD?
2012-10-17T20:03:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	no, just an image on the hard drive :sigh:
2012-10-17T20:04:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	you will need some kind of extra media to boot to and put some kind of bootloader on the system
2012-10-17T20:04:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	I just need to download something small (upto 50 Megs maybe?) that I can put on the flash drive and fix this
2012-10-17T20:05:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	you may find puppy has the chroot command on it
2012-10-17T20:06:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	thanks, but it's too big to download atm. If nothing else works I can try it later, but are there any other smaller ones.
2012-10-17T20:06:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	tinycore is about 12Mb
2012-10-17T20:07:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	awesome. I assume it has chroot?
2012-10-17T20:07:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ashwin18	not sure, could ask in their channel
2012-10-17T20:07:00.000Z	ashwin18	actionParsnip	will do. Can you tell me how to actually use chroot?
