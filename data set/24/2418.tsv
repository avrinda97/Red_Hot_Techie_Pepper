2010-09-15T02:38:00.000Z	duffydack	kai_	why do you wanna install grub when you dont have ubuntu installed ??
2010-09-15T02:39:00.000Z	kai_		just looking for the grub software duffydack . windows 7 is not working accordingly and it's a known issue. however, i'd just like to install grub, if you wouldn't mind. the actual bootable partition is sda2 (NTFS)\
2010-09-15T02:40:00.000Z	duffydack	kai_	I dont think you can install it without having boot files on a partition for it to reference... it needs them to display the menu..
2010-09-15T02:41:00.000Z	kai_		hmm
2010-09-15T02:41:00.000Z	kai_		okay ill have to check out widnnows...thanks though

2010-09-15T02:44:00.000Z	kai_		classpnp.sys
2010-09-15T02:45:00.000Z	kai_		@ duffydack
