2005-12-09T11:09:00.000Z	qwerxy		trying to install ubuntu onto a partition which already has it installed - - getting error no root volume...?
2005-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	qwerxy		have formatted as ext3...
2005-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	qwerxy		how do i make ubuntu install choose that partition as the correct one?
2005-12-09T11:11:00.000Z	nelsmar	qwerxy	didnt ubuntu let you choose? it wasnt automatic for me... in the partition manager i had to flag each partition as what it should be used for
2005-12-09T11:11:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	i'm trying to do that too
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	how did you specify which partition is the root one?
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	nelsmar	qwerxy	and it isnt letting you choose? i had a "special" computer XD i have 5 partitions.....
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	lol ok - i only have 3
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	nelsmar	qwerxy	did you open the partition manager from the install cd?
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	yes
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	nelsmar		0.o if only i remembered what it looked like lol
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	qwerxy		lol k
2005-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	nelsmar		tryng to remember it was about 2 weeks ago ><
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	should i say - ex3 journaling file system?
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	nelsmar	qwerxy	what do you see on the partition screen, are you there now?
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	yes
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	nelsmar		oh are you askign what TO use?
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	eh?
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	nelsmar		i use reiser 0.o i was goign to do reiser4 cause when i used to use linux peopel were excited about it but i guess it never hit off and no one supports...... so i kinda oopsed and ment to run ext3
2005-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	nelsmar		ide use ext3 on your root
2005-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	qwerxy		right
2005-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	nelsmar		that or reiserFS, reiser is faster out of hte box. but over time it getes cluttered and slows down a bit
2005-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	nelsmar		qwerty sorry XD i thought you couldnt figure out how to make it root lol
2005-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	qwerxy	nelsmar	ok that's fine - but then when i proceed - it says "no root file system is defined"
