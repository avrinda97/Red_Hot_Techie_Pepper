2010-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	this channel is just for support (because it's really busy).  So you can help people here and chat at the same time in #ubuntu-offtopic.  Thanks.
2010-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	No thanks Im helping people here. Thanks anyways.
2010-03-13T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	that's fine.  But move the non-support talk to #ubuntu-offtopic.  Let's move on...
2010-03-27T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	works fine
2010-03-27T14:56:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	The drives Im looking at say 3Gbps. That a bunch of bologna? Will it feel that much faster or just the same as PATA?
2010-05-12T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	try #ubuntu-bugs if no one bites here
2010-05-12T03:34:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	thank you
2010-06-03T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	scp, samba if on the same network, hundreds of other ways
2010-06-03T05:58:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	Do you know if there are any nice GUI apps like Conduit but actually work? I cant get the network transfers to work with it.
2010-06-03T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	no idea what conduit is.  Is this on the same local network?
2010-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	Yes. Im just looking for an easy GUI app if possible.
2010-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	right click on a folder -> properties -> share...
2010-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	Ah! Ok Ill try that.
2010-08-31T04:18:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	unstable as always
2010-08-31T04:19:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	Ok I figured that, just wondered if they switched to testing for the LTS releases. Thanks.
2010-09-14T02:29:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	http://www.debian.org/doc/ is probably a good place to look, don't remember
2010-09-14T02:30:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	http://wiki.debian.org/HowToSetupADebianRepository too
2010-09-14T02:31:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	thank you
2010-11-07T04:50:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	a release is by definition stable once it's released...
2010-11-07T04:52:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	don't use EOL releases...
2010-11-07T04:52:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	jrib	Why not?
2010-11-07T04:53:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	because they are EOL... They aren't supported and don't receive security updates
2010-11-07T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	best choices are latest LTS or latest release
2010-11-07T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	LinuxGuy2009	no
