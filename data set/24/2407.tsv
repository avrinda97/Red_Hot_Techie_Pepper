2009-01-24T23:48:00.000Z	Mean_Admin		are these okay options in fstab for a mounted hdd that will be basically storage:  rw,sync,auto,user ?
2009-01-24T23:48:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	yes
2009-01-24T23:49:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	thanks for confirmaiton :)
2009-01-24T23:55:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	in fdisk -l, I get this: http://pastebin.com/m778b50bd
2009-01-24T23:57:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	which parti you try to mount ?
2009-01-24T23:58:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	/dev/sda and /dev/sdb
2009-01-24T23:59:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	did you create the mountpoints ?
2009-01-25T00:00:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	I did indeed
2009-01-25T00:01:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	dmesg says " 2582.063349] VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev sda."
2009-01-25T00:01:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	sudo mount  /dev/sda5  "/mnt/wherever"  doesn't work ?
2009-01-25T00:02:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	well, just "sudo mount /dev/sda   /media/library/ " not work cause it says it needs to know the filesystem
2009-01-25T00:02:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	try to check gparted for visual fs-check
2009-01-25T00:02:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	sda >> sda5
2009-01-25T00:03:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	you can't mount whole hd, but partition
2009-01-25T00:04:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	ow!
2009-01-25T00:04:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	so I have to tell fstab or 'mount' to just mount /dev/sda/sd1 for exameple??
2009-01-25T00:05:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	paste your fstab, correct entry is f.e.  /dev/sda5
2009-01-25T00:05:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	I'll give it a whirl then
2009-01-25T00:07:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	after saving correct fstab, a sudo mount -a will mount them all
2009-01-25T00:07:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	paste it, to let me check
2009-01-25T00:19:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	all right! totally worked 1
2009-01-25T00:19:00.000Z	DasEi	Mean_Admin	nice
2009-01-25T00:19:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	thanks dude :)
2009-03-31T04:25:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	DasEi	all right thanks
