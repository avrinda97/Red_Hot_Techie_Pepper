2005-10-07T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		it pays to google for 'linux drive mount howto/tutorials' and learn how all tis works. :P
2005-10-07T06:20:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	- it sure does. that script is an eyeopener - it shows how flexible linux  scripting is
2005-10-07T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 i wasent refering to the script. :P ive never used it - lol. I know enogh fundamentals to edit fstab myself.
2005-11-05T12:10:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	- Is there a log created as things start? - where would it be?
2006-05-22T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 :)  he gave up.. in the time he complained - i could of read most of that book.
2006-05-22T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 whats scary - is that i thought the default ubuntu samba configs shared the printers  from the start.
2006-05-22T10:49:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	- True. I have read and googled more for a linux install than anything else period. (including porn - lol)Ubuntu  is pretty easy compared to other linuxes but still isn't flawless.
2006-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	- True. - Had no problems here. everything works. - but configuring Ubuntu to handle network printing for windows requires you install from the web and that can be painful to get working.
2006-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 i just love how its 'our' fault we dont/cant hand hold someone - when theres very very very good docs out on a topic.
2006-05-22T10:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 i think ya just install the samba packages and cups. and thats it. :P my printer is on its own network print-server.
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	- Printing for me was smooth. gutenprint is a wonderful project.  samba server configuration was a typographic minefield. easy only if you dot all the "I's" and cross all the "T's"
2006-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 im not even sure if the default samba config has a [printer]  entry. :P mine is so tweaked by me and i removed most of the comments
2006-06-17T09:16:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	Can you make a symlink to a remote samba directory?  or is nfs? fuser needed?
2006-06-17T09:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 you coulkd make a lnik to the dir that its getting mounted to.
2006-06-17T09:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 and proberly dirs under that one as well.
2006-06-17T09:17:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	Can you help with the syntax?
2006-06-17T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 ln -s /whatever/place /whevber/place
2006-06-17T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 unless i totally missunderstand the problem you are having
2006-06-17T09:19:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	Thanks -  <localDir>ln -s  -t="/Path/To/RemoteDir/"  /
2006-06-17T09:19:00.000Z	iiiears	Dr_Willis	Thanks -  <localDir>ln -s  -t="/Path/To/RemoteDir/"  ?
2006-06-17T09:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	iiiears	 where is this -t comming from?
