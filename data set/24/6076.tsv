2006-04-09T08:19:00.000Z	oxez		Does GNOME have something like KDE's dcop? So we can control our apps
2006-04-09T08:19:00.000Z	slavik	oxez	CTRL-CONTROL-DELETE
2006-04-09T08:20:00.000Z	oxez	slavik	hm. I don't think this is what I need. In kde you could just do: dcop amarok default nextSong, and next song would be played. I'm asking if there something like that on GNOME

2006-04-19T09:40:00.000Z	oxez	slavik	I read the config.log, it was looking for gtk/gtk.h. I did a ln -s /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gtk /usr/include/gtk, now in config.log I see something about gdk/gdk.h, I'll try to install that one
2006-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	slavik	oxez	I dunno what to say ...
