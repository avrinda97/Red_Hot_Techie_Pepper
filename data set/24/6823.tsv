2005-07-06T12:02:00.000Z	Paully	ros	it probably has more to do with the setup of the monitor than setup of the video-card. what driver does xorg use?
2005-07-06T12:04:00.000Z	Paully	ros	all info about what drivers your xorg uses are in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-06T12:11:00.000Z	Paully	ros	what is the brand of your monitor?
2005-07-06T12:16:00.000Z	Paully	ros	what brand is your monitor?
2005-07-06T12:16:00.000Z	Paully	ros	hang on
2005-07-06T12:17:00.000Z	Paully	ros	here are all your specs for your monitor. write them up: http://www.monitorworld.com/Monitors/philips/107s.html
2005-07-06T12:17:00.000Z	Paully	ros	pay special care for HFreq/VFreq
2005-07-06T12:18:00.000Z	Paully	ros	your hfreq is 30-66 and vfreq is 50-130. This is the key to get your supported resolutions
2005-07-06T12:19:00.000Z	Paully	ros	run "sudo xorgcfg" and click on the monitor -> Configure monitor(s)
2005-07-06T12:20:00.000Z	Paully	ros	run "sudo xorgcfg" and click on the monitor -> Configure monitor(s)
2005-07-06T12:21:00.000Z	Paully	ros	did you start xorgcfg?
2005-07-06T12:22:00.000Z	Paully	ros	then click on the monitor in the top-right corner and choose "Configure monitor(s)"
2005-07-06T12:22:00.000Z	Paully	ros	in this window you manually type in "30 - 66" in Horizontal sync
2005-07-06T12:23:00.000Z	Paully	ros	type in "50 - 130" in Vertical sync
2005-07-06T12:24:00.000Z	Paully	ros	and then quit
2005-07-06T12:25:00.000Z	Paully	ros	after that log out of X and press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE. This will restart X with the new values
2005-07-06T12:27:00.000Z	Paully	ros	hmmm...
2005-07-06T12:27:00.000Z	Paully	ros	might be if you haven't set up the video-card... ouch.
2005-07-06T12:28:00.000Z	Paully	ros	maybe you should restart xorgcfg just to make sure the monitor is connected to the video card and that the monitor has got a name
2005-07-06T12:33:00.000Z	Paully	ros	if you have a look at "configure monitor(s)" again. At the bottom you will see "Select card connected to monitor" and there you should see probably "i810"? it should not say "none"
2005-07-06T12:36:00.000Z	Paully	ros	at least we now know that we have the basics set up. you can exit xorgcfg now
2005-07-06T12:40:00.000Z	Paully	ros	i found what's wrong. if you look at Section "Monitor" you will see that the info you wrote in xorgcfg is there but there's a # before the values. Remove them and save the file
2005-07-06T12:52:00.000Z	Paully	ros	happy it worked out for you :-)
2005-07-06T12:53:00.000Z	Paully	ros	have to go now. take care and have fun in the world of 1280x1024!!
