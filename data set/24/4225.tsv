2007-06-11T10:08:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	do you get the same with 'sudo hcitool scan'?
2007-06-11T10:08:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	yeah
2007-06-11T10:08:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	is your bluetooth device supported?
2007-06-11T10:09:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	it shows up on hcitool scan with the bt address
2007-06-11T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	I thought you said you got "Inquiry failed"?
2007-06-11T10:10:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	i mean on hcitool dev my bt dongle is given with bt address but scan fails
2007-06-11T10:11:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	...any ideas?
2007-06-11T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	is the remote device within range?
2007-06-11T10:11:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	less than 2m
2007-06-11T10:12:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	and you've checked the obvious things, like power state?
2007-06-11T10:12:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	yeah...
2007-06-11T10:13:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	thinking?
2007-06-11T10:13:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	no, typing. I'm familiar with the error message, but I don't know what causes it. It usually starts to work for me on the third or fourth attempt. Sorry, can't give you any more specific advice.
2007-06-11T10:14:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	ok, but I have tried around 7-8 times now...
2007-06-11T10:48:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	I think it will, but it's tight
2007-06-11T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	xubuntu will need more RAM than a CLI server installation
2007-06-11T10:50:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	oops, I saw it just now...
2007-06-11T10:50:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	which is better, for a server?
2007-06-11T10:51:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	xubuntu and ubuntu differ only in the graphical interface, so the server installations from either alternate CD will be the same.
2007-06-11T10:51:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	ok, cuz i heard someone saying the ubuntu server was better, thx anyway
2007-06-11T10:53:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	BugeyeD pike_: thx for the help...
2007-06-11T10:57:00.000Z	soundray	DJ-_-	either way will work, so choose what's less effort
2007-06-11T10:59:00.000Z	DJ-_-	soundray	pike_ BugeyeD: thx again....
