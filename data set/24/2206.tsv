2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		Hi all , i installed limewire via deb file and now im unable to uninstall it . can some help?
2009-03-19T14:55:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	You should be able to find and remove it with Synaptic.
2009-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	No , i cant
2009-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		ysis:Searching in synaptic gave no results
2009-03-19T14:57:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	do you still have the .deb file?
2009-03-19T14:57:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	: no :\
2009-03-19T14:58:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	Can you download it again? Then just double-click on it. This should give you a popup where you can hit a deinstallation button.
2009-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		ysis:i'll search for it again
2009-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		ysis:also tried to dkpg -r limewire
2009-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	i'llgo find it.
2009-03-19T14:59:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	I could always deinstall via Synaptic when I installed with this debi package manager thingy.
2009-03-19T15:03:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	Ok found it , 80%....
2009-03-19T15:04:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	Is it working?
2009-03-19T15:06:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	when i open the deb i can only see Reinstall Package
2009-03-19T15:09:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	Sorry, I was mistaken. Try this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474610
2009-03-19T15:09:00.000Z	ysis		But you need to know the package name.
2009-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	the name of the package is limewire-basic , so i can apt-get remove it no?
2009-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	ysis		RanyAlbec: Just try 'sudo apt-get remove limewire-basic' then.
2009-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	ysis		Or look for it in the synaptic package manager.
2009-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	ysis		Not the Add/Remove.. thingy
2009-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	ysis		!hi | bond__
2009-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	thanks. that is done . but i still see the .limewire dir on my home folder
2009-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ysis	should i just remove it?
2009-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	ysis	RanyAlbeg	That's where your configuration files are. If you plan on reinstalling later leave it.
