2008-07-13T00:34:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	what devices are you using? tv tuner and webcam?
2008-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	yeah
2008-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	I want to switch them because there is no way to specify which device cheese uses, and that is the only cam program that works for me

2008-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	somethigns strange, when i did dmesg | grep video the video1 device doesnt show up, however it works and is displayed in skype
2008-07-13T00:47:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	does   udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/video4linux/video1 show anything?
2008-07-13T00:48:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	no valid sysfs device found
2008-07-13T00:48:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	its weird though, if i open an applciation that allows video device swtiching the video1 device is there as an option and works
2008-07-13T00:48:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	how about   udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/video4linux/video0 ?
2008-07-13T00:49:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	yeah that finds my tv tuner
2008-07-13T00:50:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	thats strange so webcam desn't show. is it usb? does lsusb show it?
2008-07-13T00:50:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	yes it is, and yes i do see it there
2008-07-13T00:51:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	or at least i think it is, it says logitech, Inc. but it could be another logitech device
2008-07-13T00:52:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	you have other usb logitech device?
2008-07-13T00:52:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	yeah that keyboard and mouse
2008-07-13T00:55:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	that link i sent you mentions hwscan. does that show anything useful?
2008-07-13T00:55:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	what does hwscan do? it looks like he is using it for a specific program
2008-07-13T00:58:00.000Z	legend2440	ajhtiredwolf	your right. to use that you have to install xawtv. its in synaptic then in terminal    xawtv -hwscan
2008-07-13T00:59:00.000Z	ajhtiredwolf	legend2440	i cant imagine that his webcam isnt usb, i wonder why his shows up
