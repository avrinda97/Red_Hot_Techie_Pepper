2007-07-10T06:42:00.000Z	askand		When I connect to another computer with vncwiever I get connected and see the screen but changes on the other computer doesnt show..e.g I miniize a window no the coomputer I control and it still appears maximized in my computer..why?
2007-07-10T06:43:00.000Z	kslat3r	askand	sounds like the vnc server is not accepting events from the client
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	askand	kslat3r	how do I make it accept that?
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	kslat3r	askand	what OS is the server on?

2007-07-10T06:59:00.000Z	askand	kslat3r	I have two ubuntu laptops, on one of them I have enabled remotedektop. I write vncviewer ipnumber:0 on the other and allows the remote connection on the first computer. I then get the screen from the first laptop in my second laptop and I can move the mouse. The problem is if I open a folder or program or anything in the laptop that has remote dektop enabled and am am connected to I dont see anything on the other
