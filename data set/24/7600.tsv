2004-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	ploum		Hello
2004-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	ploum		I just send my review
2004-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	ploum		Thanks ;-)
2004-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	ploum		Well, I read it now and there's so much mispelling :-(
2004-09-07T08:32:00.000Z	ploum		And there seems to be a bug in Abi with color
2004-09-07T08:34:00.000Z	ploum		?
2004-09-07T08:34:00.000Z	ploum		I will do it !
2004-09-07T08:34:00.000Z	ploum		Abiword was for colors and images..
2004-09-07T08:35:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	I take it you didn't use the "erase entire disk" option?
2004-09-07T08:36:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	the post-reboot progress bar thing's known but will take some time to fix because debconf doesn't yet have progress bar support.
2004-09-07T08:38:00.000Z	ploum	Kamion	I know that somes things are difficult or already know. But it's my full first impression
2004-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	were you DHCPing?
2004-09-07T09:51:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	that was a bug in base-config, it wasn't telling aptitude to ignore Recommends:
2004-09-07T09:51:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	it's fixed in the daily builds
2004-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	probably :-)
2004-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	ploum	Kamion	so I will wait and hang around there before testing :-)
2004-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	might be quite late today though
2004-10-29T15:42:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	yes
2004-10-29T15:42:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	well, up to UpstreamVersionFreeze anyway
2004-10-29T15:49:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	might want to talk to the fledgling documentation team
2004-10-29T15:50:00.000Z	ploum	Kamion	where can I find hem ?
2004-10-29T15:52:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	there's stuff on the wiki I believe
2004-11-05T16:07:00.000Z	Kamion	ploum	you haven't logged in then
2004-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	ploum	Kamion	spiv : oups, yes, I wasn't logged. But this is because most of page cannot be edited..
