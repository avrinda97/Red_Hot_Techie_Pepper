2005-12-04T14:46:00.000Z	bluefox83		yeah
2005-12-04T14:47:00.000Z	bluefox83		i wasn't sure how ubuntu handles gnome's config files, most distros just let gnome use ~/.gnome
2005-12-04T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	is there a way to mark text in the console ignoring the newlines?
2005-12-04T14:49:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	say what!?!?!
2005-12-04T14:50:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	if you hold Ctrl and mark text in Konsole, all of it gets copied to the clipboard *except* the newline characters. It would be great if I could do that in gnome-terminal.
2005-12-04T14:51:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	what are newline charectors?
2005-12-04T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	ach, forget it.
2006-12-05T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	to have a CPU-optimized version that saves you .01 seconds on each run ;)
2007-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	I would first check the connection speed with something like http://www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/
2007-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	to make sure the problem isn't on the provider side
2007-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	already did, when downloading via a browser i get speeds of 230k-250k
2007-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	and when is it that you get only 3k?
2007-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	torrents, and dcc
2007-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	when apt downloads, i get speeds of no more than 35k
2007-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	if you think your router may be throttling those, it's just a matter of going through all the relevant options in the setup
2007-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	i don't have a clue what those would be though...
2007-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	some people are computer retarded..i am routing retarded
2007-01-18T06:21:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	Linksys calls it QoS, I think. Just disable all those options
2007-01-18T06:23:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	i don't see anything called QoS
2007-01-18T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	this page any help? http://linksys.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1701
2007-01-18T06:31:00.000Z	bluefox83	soundray	i do not have that model of router...
2007-03-24T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-03-24T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	'sudo fdisk -l'
2007-10-28T23:34:00.000Z	soundray	bluefox83	you could probably delete your ./.config/menus in safe mode and regenerate it with update-menus.
