2010-01-28T03:48:00.000Z	bobmanuk		thanks
2010-01-28T03:49:00.000Z	bobmanuk		i need to activate the bc43 drivers without having a network connection... all pages ive found suggest updating apt-get and then things will install and what not
2010-01-28T03:49:00.000Z	bobmanuk		but i have no wireless and no access to a net connection other than wireless
2010-01-28T03:50:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	yea the ethernet doesn't work on mine either.. although i always use wifi :o/
2010-01-28T03:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	and 'can' you plug into the network with a cable?
2010-01-28T03:54:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	can you plug in with a cable? it might be a easy fix to upgrade that way
2010-01-28T03:55:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	which driver/card?
2010-01-28T03:57:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	broadcom bcm4312
2010-01-28T03:57:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	just trying to boot unr so i can find out what the exact package its after is called
2010-01-28T03:58:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	you are trying to use a live usb?
2010-01-28T03:58:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	i used a live usb to install yes, it worked fine when i initially ran from the usb, but now it doesnt work
2010-01-28T04:00:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	i tried to mount the usb and force apt to see it as a repository to hopefully let me use the drivers, but theyre already installed on the system, just not allowed to activate
2010-01-28T04:01:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	ok well then i assume the driver is on the usb and you are just lacking a way to enable...  maybe we can force the driver with modprobe. one sec while i look around
2010-01-28T04:02:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	thanks, just fyi it says broadcom STA proprietary wireless driver
2010-01-28T04:03:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	i'm checking here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1368699 and here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1368946
2010-01-28T04:04:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	try the first link step 2
2010-01-28T04:06:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	they are already installed, but i will attempt again from the USB
2010-01-28T04:13:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	wow... thanks, it now works, just a reinstall of the same packages works a treat
2010-01-28T04:13:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	thing is ive been trying this with kubuntu and unr for days... yet its only just worked straight out of the gates :)
2010-01-28T04:14:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	i assume that it didn't install because it didn't know??? but the packages were on the usb which worked live??
2010-01-28T04:14:00.000Z	Out_Cold	bobmanuk	good to see it working now though
2010-01-28T04:16:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	yeah but i did aptitude search dkms and bcmwl (both seperately of course)
2010-01-28T04:16:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	 and they were installed, after asking the command line to reinstall it, it did so and same issue
2010-01-28T04:16:00.000Z	bobmanuk	Out_Cold	but anyway, ta very much
