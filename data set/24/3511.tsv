2009-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	there's already rar support in the repository, you don't need to install a seperate third party program
2009-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	i yust want to use WinRAR not rar suport
2009-01-26T17:32:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	why would you want to use expiry nagware when we already have support for it in the standard tools?
2009-01-26T17:32:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	installing ubuntu-restricted-extras will get pretty much all the standard extras installed
2009-01-26T17:33:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	(mp3, flash, rar, java, etc)
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	ok ty but if i want install Open Office from tar.gz what i need do?
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	don't
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	why?
2009-01-26T17:38:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	go to http://download.openoffice.org/other.html, and use the linux deb
2009-01-26T17:38:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	but for other files
2009-01-26T17:38:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	what other files?
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	in general, anything even remotely mainstream is available as a deb or a repository.  Try to avoid using tar.gz's, .run's, zip's, etc
2009-01-26T17:40:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	why i need avoid them? it dangerous?
2009-01-26T17:40:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	they're not designed for ubuntu, people have already gone through the work to make packages that work with our package managers, so that install/uninstall work properly
2009-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	they'll work, but uninstalling may or may not work, the application menu may or may not get the icon, other related features may not work properly with the system, etc
2009-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	ok so every program must have deb package?
2009-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	not 'must', but you definately want to use a repository or a deb if you can
2009-01-26T17:42:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	there's not much out there that won't have it
2009-01-26T17:45:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	maybe you now how i can mount iso images?
2009-01-26T17:45:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	you should be able to directly view them
2009-01-26T17:46:00.000Z	Rencx	cwillu	not view but run like CD
2009-01-26T17:46:00.000Z	cwillu	Rencx	what cd exactly?
