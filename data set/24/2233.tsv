2010-08-06T00:27:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	ah i see
2010-08-06T00:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	if you currently have an xorg.conf - "mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.orig" then you could restart and be using Nouveau.  If you want to retry nvidia - "sudo nvidia-xconfig".  Good luck.
2010-08-06T00:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	i'd try it first without uninstalling anything.
2010-08-06T00:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	IF you have nvidia enabled in Hardware Drivers
2010-08-06T00:29:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	DasEi i entered the synaptic a while ago, then removed the nvidia things and hen removed the xorg.conf file, i can enter in ugly graphics mode... so what's your reommendatrion now?
2010-08-06T00:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	"sudo nvidia-xconfig" then restart x again
2010-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	use Hardware Drivers instead of synaptic, if you don't have nvidia installed
2010-08-06T00:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	see my message above!
2010-08-06T00:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	if you've installed nvidia - there is a kernel module installed that requires a Reboot!
2010-08-06T00:33:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	ok, i'll reboot then
2010-08-06T01:10:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	DasEi i just reboted now... now i got screen again, ut i guess it's not the nvidia driver... also it's whowing the spalsh screen... butt i told it to not to do... weid
2010-08-06T01:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	proprietary nvidia destroys Plymouth (boot splash) - fact of life i'm affraid.
2010-08-06T01:12:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	then next step is... i think i have no nvidia drivers, and no way to detect if i have nvidia...
2010-08-06T01:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	System / Admin / Hardware Drivers
2010-08-06T01:13:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	yes, i'm in that place, but it's not detecting my card
2010-10-20T03:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	i don't think it exists anymore, was a distro - but that totally OT for this channel.  you could ask in ##linux
2010-12-28T05:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	"enough" is relative to what you will be installing.  I use 8GB for my VMs but my main system have 500GB for /
2010-12-28T05:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	again - it depends on what you will be installing.  If you plan on installing commercial games, which i personally do, then 25GB would be too small for my needs.
2010-12-28T05:34:00.000Z	cablop	ZykoticK9	nah, it is a netbook, just a few games on it
2011-05-06T04:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	i believe the regular Unity does yes, Unity 2D does not.
2011-05-06T04:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	it's probably still "experimental" or something similar
2011-05-06T04:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	Unity is not lightweight, check out lxde
2011-05-06T04:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	look for some screenshots - it's certainly different
2011-06-24T07:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cablop	i too have issues with eth0 appearing as eth1 on SEVERAL installs (though they are VMs, but typically they start as eth0 then majically on reboots become eth1 - it's a pain)
