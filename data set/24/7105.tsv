2006-12-24T15:38:00.000Z	erik_		hello
2006-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	erik_		I've a problem with the system clock in Ubuntu
2006-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	erik_		I installed Ubuntu with UTC as system time
2006-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	erik_		Afterward I updated my clock using ntp
2006-12-24T15:40:00.000Z	erik_		problem is that ntp seems to update my system clock with my local time
2006-12-24T15:40:00.000Z	erik_		how can i change this? I want to set the system clock to my local time
2006-12-24T15:41:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	erm... NTP will update the clock with GMT/UTC.... the localtime limrary will telly ou what the local time is
2006-12-24T15:41:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	the unix clock is always supposed to be set to GMT... but mony programs / logfiles etc. normally show you the calculated localtime
2006-12-24T15:42:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	i.e. the clock does not need to be "changed" for daylight-savings
2006-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	right... so what is the problem ?
2006-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	maybe MythTV does not have its timezone configured correctly
2006-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	mythtv has its own timezone settings for listings... if this is wrong the listings are all screwed up
2006-12-24T15:45:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	at a console/terminal, do "date -u; date"  (without quote marks)
2006-12-24T15:46:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	well thats a problem.
2006-12-24T15:46:00.000Z	erik_	enyc	how can i change this?
2006-12-24T15:46:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	"sudo ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org" to update the time
2006-12-24T15:46:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	(note that -u here is totoally different reason)
2006-12-24T15:47:00.000Z	erik_	enyc	thanks
2006-12-24T15:47:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	now is the date -u and date  times correct?
2006-12-24T15:48:00.000Z	erik_	enyc	it is. Last time i tried ntpdate i used ntp.ubuntu.com . Is it possible that this server is sending a local time?
2006-12-24T15:48:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	dont think so
2006-12-24T15:49:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	ntp is all done in UTC afaik
2006-12-24T15:49:00.000Z	erik_	enyc	anyway. The time is correct now. Thnanks
2006-12-24T15:49:00.000Z	enyc	erik_	I would be tempted to reboot and check the time updates correctly
