2007-04-04T12:02:00.000Z	steel_lady	EADG	can you lead me please? first do you know where is the installation of that ffmpg program?
2007-04-04T12:02:00.000Z	steel_lady		and EADG how to get codecs
2007-04-04T12:02:00.000Z	EADG		Windows for what? to xfer data to ppc?
2007-04-04T12:03:00.000Z	EADG		ffmpg or tcpmp? ffmpg is for linux, tcpmp is player for ppc
2007-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	steel_lady	EADG	what are these plugins for windows mobile?
2007-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	EADG	steel_lady	the codecs for tcpmp are on the tcpmp website... with tcpmp installed you shouldn't have to convert your videos (thats what ffmpeg is for)
2007-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	EADG	steel_lady	sec, lemme find site.
2007-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	steel_lady		http://picard.exceed.hu/tcpmp/0.71/ EADG
2007-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	EADG		:)
2007-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	steel_lady	EADG	what are these plug-ins?
2007-04-04T12:07:00.000Z	steel_lady	EADG	should I dl all of them?
2007-04-04T12:07:00.000Z	EADG	steel_lady	Plugins are just some extra bits for tcpmp... for playing uncommon files types.
2007-04-04T12:08:00.000Z	EADG	steel_lady	start with the base program first.
2007-04-04T12:09:00.000Z	steel_lady	EADG	I would like to install converting tools anyway because I would like to have it soon on my PDA and can not set up my windows now
2007-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	EADG	steel_lady	We should take this offline, not really linux related... /join #EADG and I'll help ya out.
