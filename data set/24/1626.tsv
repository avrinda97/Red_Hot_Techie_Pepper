2009-10-28T22:19:00.000Z	asfjio		hello, when i restart my computer the sound blaster beeps more that 3 times. is it possible to disable it? is it assosiated with the specific OS or it is independant hardware aprt which should be managed from the BIOS?
2009-10-28T22:20:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: beep? is it before the OS loaded?
2009-10-28T22:20:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: beep? is it before the OS loaded? If so then there's something wrong in your hardware
2009-10-28T22:21:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	when restarting (already inside OS), before loading ubuntu screen, while loading ubuntu screen. this times.
2009-10-28T22:23:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: is it a wailing sound (or at least something like that) ?
2009-10-28T22:23:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: wailing sound usually means your CPU fan is failing
2009-10-28T22:24:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	you talk about the case itself or about this beep sound? i don't hear strange things from the case.
2009-10-28T22:24:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: so is it from your speaker?
2009-10-28T22:26:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	it is coming from the case, but it is like beep. afaik it is sound blaster. i hear it also when i'm in the tty's and no gui is loaded and type commands which i'm trying to autocomplete with tab.
2009-10-28T22:27:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: agree with Slart, any problem after this beep? (PC hangs/restart?)
2009-10-28T22:27:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	no as of now.
2009-10-28T22:27:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: the easisest wway to check you MB i believe is open up you case -_-a (at least for me)
2009-10-28T22:31:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: that's it, it's an ASUS A8V then
2009-10-28T22:33:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: well, to be honest, I don't quite understand your problem, it can range from driver issues to hardware failure... i need to narrow it a bit
2009-10-28T22:34:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: do your sound (e.g. music) works well?
2009-10-28T22:35:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	yes, my music works well.
2009-10-28T22:36:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: then, when exactly that beep come?
2009-10-28T22:37:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	when i click the shurdown/restart button comes first beep.
2009-10-28T22:38:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: i believe it's normal, it does also in my box
2009-10-28T22:38:00.000Z	asfjio	furuno	so this beeps are normal? and they can't be stopped?
2009-10-28T22:38:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: i suppose
2009-10-28T22:39:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	: I don't think it's annoying, in fact it notice me that my system is succesfully shutting down
2009-10-28T22:40:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	/ Slart : FYI, my MB is an ECS A780GM-M V1.1
2009-10-28T22:40:00.000Z	furuno	asfjio	/ Slart : GM-A, I mean
