2009-01-30T07:25:00.000Z	nathanhelp		I would like some advice. I have two machines. One has Ubuntu, the other has a duel boot WinXP, and Ubuntu, each on separate Harddrives. I want all three to be able to link to the same Thunderbird profile. Any tips?
2009-01-30T07:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Dropbox
2009-01-30T07:26:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Or rsync, pick your favourite
2009-01-30T07:30:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	If I understood you correctly, you need to sync between 4 different OS right?
2009-01-30T07:30:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	No just 2 different os's on three different HD's
2009-01-30T07:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	And that is why I said, Dropbox, or rsync :)
2009-01-30T08:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	sudo fdisk -l, just lists all the partitions
2009-01-30T08:02:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	So why does it need sudo?
2009-01-30T08:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	It needs the sudo permissions to read the partition table off the harddisk
2009-01-30T08:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	You would have to compile the entire driver yourself. Compiling is a pain, and most of the time dependency hell
2009-01-30T08:25:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	What does that mean? what is compiling? Please explain as clearly as you can, I'm trying to learn but theres a lot to take in.
2009-01-30T08:26:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Sure. The source, is the source code itself (what developers write). It is then compiled (machine code - something computers can read/understand) into a binary
2009-01-30T08:27:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Binaries are highly platform dependent (so, a binary for a 32bit OS will mostof the time not work with 64 bit OS)
2009-01-30T08:27:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	 so a binary file are the ones i want to download?
2009-01-30T08:27:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	In order to solve the pain that is caused by compiling (trust me it is a pain if things don't work out properly), Ubuntu gives many many softwares as binaries tailored to your OS
2009-01-30T08:28:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Yes, but it is much more preffered that you get the packages from Ubuntu repositories since they have been tested by many many peopl
2009-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	Ok. I have no ntfs-3g in my accessible list. Restricted is enabled. what else can i do to access them?
2009-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	What version of ubuntu are you runnning?
2009-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	8.10
2009-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	Gnome.
2009-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	You should have ntfs-3g :S
2009-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	I know i should have them but i dont. Or am looking in the wrong place.
2009-01-30T08:31:00.000Z	nathanhelp	WebcamWonder	I'm going to try closing my synaptic and trying some install from terminal in case they are IN the repo, but not on my list for some reason.
2009-01-30T08:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	nathanhelp	Synaptic and the terminal read one and the same list, there is no difference. I haven't worked with Intrepid, but on hardy, they do show up as an extra package. I presuem they are now directly integrated into the kernel somehow
