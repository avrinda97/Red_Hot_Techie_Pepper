2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		Anyone aware of how to connect to a linksys wireless router from ubuntu?
2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		This has been the brunt of my passed few hours.
2009-01-20T09:48:00.000Z	cattlesnake		I have tried every combination of ndiswrapper.
2009-01-20T09:49:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> what is the chip used on your client wifi card?
2009-01-20T09:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> you are already connected to the internet as of now
2009-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	-> Yes, I am, on *this* computer.  This is a desktop.  My laptop has ubuntu on it
2009-01-20T09:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> get another cat 5 cable and attached one end to your laptop and the other end to your linksys router
2009-01-20T09:58:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	thanks, but I'd rather not.
2009-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> you'd rather not? why ask her for help?
2009-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> you'd rather not? why ask here* for help?
2009-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	I'd rather not have a cable running from my laptop to the cable.  I'd like to extend my laptop's use outside the living room.
2009-01-20T10:00:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> get a longer cable?
2009-01-20T10:01:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	from here-on-in it's turtles all the down.
2009-01-20T10:02:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	you are both a hoot and a holler.
2009-01-20T10:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> we're having a lil fun yeah?
2009-01-20T10:33:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> i was teasing you, and remember we were waiting for you to tell us about your wirless
2009-01-20T10:41:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> you dont like my 1st suggestion of using a cat 5 cable to just try it out first eh? make sure everything is okay, then switch to wireless after?
2009-01-20T10:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> have we ever find out your wifi chip you use on your laptop? internal or usb attached? pcmcia?
2009-01-20T10:55:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	-- I believe we did, and it is a Marvell Topdog or Hotdog or something.
2009-01-20T10:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> internal? pcmcia card you plug in? or usb you plug in?
2009-01-20T10:56:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	-- it is a wireless card already inside of the laptop, not anything I plug in.
2009-01-20T10:56:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> was it turned on when you did   sudo lshw -C network?
2009-01-20T10:57:00.000Z	cattlesnake	n8tuser	-- it was.
2009-01-20T10:57:00.000Z	n8tuser	cattlesnake	-> and what was the result?  post it in pastebin please
