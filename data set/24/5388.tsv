2006-07-27T12:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	By reading the installation notes on the site where you found the program
2006-07-28T11:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	no
2006-07-28T11:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	you can add a firewall manager like firestarter

2006-07-28T11:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	yea, it is nice once you relax, no spyware, adware virii
2006-07-28T11:23:00.000Z	hbi	Jack_Sparrow	but the problem is with now anti virus telling me theres none their i just have to trust the os and im not used to that at all lol
2006-07-28T11:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	 If a problem pops up it is fixed and put in upgrades really fast
2006-07-28T11:34:00.000Z	hbi	Jack_Sparrow	with firewalls on the windows side... if someone is doing a nessus scan it flags up so i know that someone is trying to do stuff to my comp..... without a firewall in place on ubuntu that wouldnt flag up would it? or would there be no reason because i am not vulnerable to any exploit nessus can find?
2006-07-28T11:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	no reason to worry
2006-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	hbi	Jack_Sparrow	 being the fact im new to ubuntu i might be a sloppy user could i accidently make myself vulnerable.... and if i where to what would i have to do to make myself vulnerable.... or is the fact u need to get root to do anything to the system?
2006-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	just keep to the repositories for your software and relax..
2006-08-06T09:48:00.000Z	hbi	Jack_Sparrow	 is their a package i can download that has the nubuntu package on it (im on ubunto atm)
2006-08-06T09:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	you want the ubuntu-desktop?
2006-08-06T09:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hbi	I never heard of nbuntu but I would assume there might be a dpkg install nubuntu-desktop that would install the packages in nubuntu
