2006-05-25T09:08:00.000Z	karl		Hi everyone :)
2006-05-25T09:10:00.000Z	karl		Anyone know how i can get my sudo back?
2006-05-25T09:10:00.000Z	soundray	karl	what's wrong with it?
2006-05-25T09:16:00.000Z	karl	soundray	Well, every command i use it just goes : "sudo: timestamp too far in the future:" :S
2006-05-25T09:23:00.000Z	soundray	karl	run 'sudo -K'
2006-05-25T09:24:00.000Z	karl	soundray	"sudo: timestamp too far in the future: May 20 18:25:18 2006"
2006-05-25T09:24:00.000Z	soundray	karl	is that when you run sudo -K ?
2006-05-25T09:24:00.000Z	karl	soundray	yeah
2006-05-25T09:25:00.000Z	soundray	karl	what's the current system time?
2006-05-25T09:26:00.000Z	karl	soundray	17:25. I changed it, once like an hour ago, and it was then sudo stopped working
2006-05-25T09:27:00.000Z	soundray	karl	change it to 18:25, run sudo -K, then set it back to the correct time again.
2006-05-25T09:28:00.000Z	karl	soundray	The problem is, i can't change it back....whenever i try to use either sudo, root or su function it gives me an error...(I.e. when i use the "adjust date and time", it asks for a su passwd, i enter it, and it says : conversation with su failed)
2006-05-25T09:29:00.000Z	soundray	karl	it will fix itself in one hour, if you can wait that long.
2006-05-25T09:30:00.000Z	karl	soundray	Yes, thanks alot m8 :D
2006-05-25T09:31:00.000Z	karl	soundray	typo, thanks alot -mate- :)
2006-05-25T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	karl	I'm not British, if that's what you thought ;)
2006-05-25T09:32:00.000Z	karl	soundray	No, it's not that, i'm just an old WoW-fanatic, so i have a bad habit of writing things like : thx, lol, m8 +++, and i'm trying to stop :)
