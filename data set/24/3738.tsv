2007-11-01T01:09:00.000Z	sjovan	IneedHelp	i don't know. maby you installed the wrong drivers. but if it don't work just: cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-bak before you do anything
2007-11-01T01:22:00.000Z	IneedHelp	sjovan	The thing went out of the HZ again and I cant see whats happening
2007-11-01T01:23:00.000Z	sjovan	IneedHelp	did you make a backup of xorg as i told you?
