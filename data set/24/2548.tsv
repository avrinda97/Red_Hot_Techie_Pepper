2009-05-01T01:50:00.000Z	Roasted		What's everybody's favored media player in Ubuntu?
2009-05-01T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 i tend to use mplayer, smplayer, or vlc
2009-05-01T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 xmms2 is a 'server'  you run clients that connect to it.
2009-05-01T01:59:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- I don't mean tos ound like an idiot... but what does that accomplish, essentially?
2009-05-01T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 it lets other machines on the lan connect I guess. I never bother with it.
2009-05-01T02:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 it also allows easially customized interfaces
2009-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 it does not have an icon.
2009-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 its a 'service'
2009-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- So how do I use it?
2009-05-01T02:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 i would say check its docs.. and install a xmms2 client.
2009-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 some days it pays to read a programs docs   befor running it.
2009-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- yeah, cause I have them. ;)
2009-05-01T02:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	  theres dozens of 'media' players other then xmms2
2009-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 whatever floats your boat.. fire up the package manager and start looking. :)
2009-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- did you vote for xmms2 or did you have another one you liked?
2009-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 try them all.
2009-05-01T02:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 i rarely listen to music
2009-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- I have done that. But when looking over the smb.conf I saw the "guest account" section. I just wasn't sure if the default guest account tagged with samba that I could add a password to. It's just a generic password, but I wanted to have SOMETHING on it. I just wasn't sure if I could tag the default guest acct with a PW or not.
2009-05-02T06:50:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	- I added a "guest" account with a completely separate share on my samba rig. Mostly so if friends come over and want to push a music video to me or something they can use guest - password and not know my credentials to MMMMYYYY samba account where the good stuff is. :P
2011-09-22T05:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 im finding 11.10 working better for my Nvidia system then 10.04 or 11.04 did. :)   which is good news.
2011-09-22T05:28:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	nice, nice. I wonder if 11.10 is safe enough to install on a HTPC... but considering its just a HTPC... I suppose it cant be bad?
2011-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	after all, can't I update 11.10 if I go that route to be 100% current when its finally released? or would I have to do a fresh install?
2011-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Roasted	 for now. theres going go be quite a few updates  untill its released. You canupgrade yes.
2011-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	Roasted	dr_willis	okay. I wasn't sure if I had to wait till a certain stage to upgrade it as the final edition though.
