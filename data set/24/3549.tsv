2007-12-31T10:04:00.000Z	alogon		I am having trouble with the Ubuntu install disk, it comes up to the login prompt, count down from 10 then goes to an error saying my session only lasted less than 10 seconds if i have not logged outmy self there i some installation problem or that i might be out of disk space
2007-12-31T10:04:00.000Z	truna	alogon	install disk asking you to log on?
2007-12-31T10:05:00.000Z	alogon	truna	well, it gives me a log on prompt, then it says it will log on automatically in 10 seconds
2007-12-31T10:05:00.000Z	truna	alogon	which cdrom is this?
2007-12-31T10:07:00.000Z	alogon	truna	sorry its the Ubuntu 7.10 desktop edition (standard personal computer) from ubuntu.com
2007-12-31T10:07:00.000Z	truna	alogon	no way, any install cdrom i have used never asked for a login..
2007-12-31T10:10:00.000Z	alogon	truna	"ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso" from ubuntu.com the error it gets when trying to start Gnome(i assume) is "refusing to initialize GTK+"
2007-12-31T10:11:00.000Z	truna	alogon	 are you sure thats a good download iso? check the md5sum
2007-12-31T10:11:00.000Z	alogon	truna	one sec
2007-12-31T10:13:00.000Z	alogon	truna	MD5 (ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso) = d2334dbba7313e9abc8c7c072d2af09c
2007-12-31T10:13:00.000Z	alogon	truna	where can i check the MD5 aginst, at ubuntu.com it just downloads its not like an ftp server with the checksums
2007-12-31T10:14:00.000Z	truna	alogon	okay, and you have an i386 cpu?
2007-12-31T10:14:00.000Z	alogon	truna	p4 3.0ghz ht processor, yup
2007-12-31T10:15:00.000Z	truna	alogon	you burned the cdrom in low speed like 1x? somehow higher speed kinda breaks the burning process..i dont know why..
2007-12-31T10:15:00.000Z	alogon	truna	it gets as far as the XDM or GDM login screen, the graphical one but when it goes to log into gnome it give me this error
2007-12-31T10:16:00.000Z	truna	alogon	 wait a minute, you said install disk, they dont have log ons...only once you have it installed where you get a log on prompt
2007-12-31T10:17:00.000Z	alogon	truna	i probably burned it at 24x but i would think that if it makes it so far to boot, load the kernal and get as far as running GDM and just haivng some GTK error that the disk works fine just figured this might be a glitch someone else had seen before
2007-12-31T10:18:00.000Z	truna	alogon	i have experienced several problems with burning it at higher speeds..i have a dozen or so cup coasters to prove it..
2007-12-31T10:18:00.000Z	alogon	truna	i am able to do the ctrl+alt+f(keys) to switch to a terminal that is logged in, is there a ncurses bassed installer i could use?
2007-12-31T10:18:00.000Z	truna	alogon	again, no logon prompt on installs, only once it is installed and it boots where you get a login prompt
2007-12-31T10:19:00.000Z	truna	alogon	are you sure you have not installed it yet?
2007-12-31T10:19:00.000Z	alogon	truna	yes, i all i have done is poped in the cd after burning it
2007-12-31T10:22:00.000Z	alogon	truna	i appreciate the help man, i dont mean to be difficult I will test burning xubuntu and see if it gives me the same issues
2007-12-31T11:14:00.000Z	alogon	truna	i figured out my issue, i had to set my P+ATA and S+ATA controllers in bios to legacy mode, it didnt like enhanced mode
