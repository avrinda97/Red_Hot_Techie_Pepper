2007-04-17T11:45:00.000Z	Andeh		Hello
2007-04-17T11:46:00.000Z	Andeh		Is it possible to convert my entire linux filesystem to Reiser4?
2007-04-17T11:47:00.000Z	Andeh		Is it possible to change my filesystem into ReiserFS somehow?
2007-04-17T11:47:00.000Z	Andeh		And keep all the stuff?
2007-04-17T11:48:00.000Z	Andeh		If i convert my filesystem into ReiserFS will it still work?
2007-04-17T11:48:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	not 'change' no.  you can reformat
2007-04-17T11:48:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	you can only reformat it as something else, it means you haveto reinstall so technically yes it will work
2007-04-17T11:49:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	Ok... so if i wanted to have my system on REISERFS i would need to boot onto ubuntu livecd, use GParted and copy my sys into a tar on my external drive, format and copy back?
2007-04-17T11:49:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	Sounds nice...
2007-04-17T11:49:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	well maybe yes but you will have a grub problem
2007-04-17T11:50:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	What kind of problem and how would i fix it?
2007-04-17T11:50:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	oh... What about my installed aps?
2007-04-17T11:51:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	i don't have a system worked out how to copy/paste stuff back and forth that way.  technically ifyou reinstalled than copied your tared over top of that system it should bring everything back to before but i've never tried it
2007-04-17T11:51:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	Thanks! And is it possible to somehow compress a drive? Cause my homefolder is huge and putting some of the stuff into some kind of compressed thing it would help.
2007-04-17T11:51:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	i guess my answer is half an answer, it should give you basic info, you will haveto search for the rest
2007-04-17T11:52:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	apparently linux is happy with just copying stuff, no registry shit to worry about, so it should work. Dunno about grub tho.
2007-04-17T11:54:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	google up rsync and cron
2007-04-17T11:54:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	ok...
2007-04-17T11:55:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	can rsync TAR.GZ it?
2007-04-17T11:56:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	no your script .gzips it rsynch just sends over a dif of the file so you arent copying everything every single time
2007-04-17T11:57:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	So rsync would send a tiny part of the file thats different?? that doesnt sound right, not with GZ
2007-04-17T11:58:00.000Z	Andeh	holycow	So it can handle GZips natively?
2007-04-17T11:58:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	i already told you
2007-04-17T11:58:00.000Z	holycow	Andeh	actually i'm wrong on one part
