2006-01-03T09:04:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ??
2006-01-03T09:05:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	if your'e on a livecd, you could copy the /etc/X11/xorg.conf from there that works
2006-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	the livecd won't work?
2006-01-03T09:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	i'd still say to try and do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-01-03T09:25:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	got an error to paste?
2006-01-03T09:26:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	something about no screens found?
2006-01-03T09:26:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	did you reconfigure and pick the right settings for your monitor
2006-01-03T09:29:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	using breezy eh?
2006-01-03T09:29:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	did you fresh install breezy or upgrade to it?
2006-01-03T09:29:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	what video card?
2006-01-03T09:30:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	using fglrx?
2006-01-03T09:30:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and find the "driver" line and change it to "ati" or "radeon"
2006-01-03T09:31:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eddye	good luck nonetheless
