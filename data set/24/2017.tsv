2011-06-16T01:53:00.000Z	slack-m		Ok, So when I use putty to ssh to my ubuntu server the program 'mc' always looks messed up. This is specific to ubuntu, because with the same exact putty config and same environment variable it works fine on: BSD, slackware and somethign called prox. Why does ubuntu trash my ascii?
