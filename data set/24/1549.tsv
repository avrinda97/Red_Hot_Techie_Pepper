2009-12-20T00:43:00.000Z	soopos		What is wrong in the command "sudo xhost me" in trying to allow only one user to access the display in Ubuntu?
2009-12-20T00:45:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	you should not need xhost at all - what are you really trying to accomplish?
2009-12-20T00:48:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I am trying to solve a "no access" to display problem
2009-12-20T00:48:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	I figured as much :-) - please tell us a bit more about your situation
2009-12-20T00:50:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I type "evince pdf-file". It says No access to display
2009-12-20T00:50:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	who is the user in your terminal (type whoami)
2009-12-20T00:50:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	The error is "Error: Can't open display: :0.0
2009-12-20T00:51:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	soopo
2009-12-20T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	ah - you are remote?
2009-12-20T00:51:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	The owner of the files is soopo too. I am not remote.
2009-12-20T00:53:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	are you in the GUI at all - or are you at a virtual console?
2009-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I am in a virtual console: bash
2009-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	so you are not within the GUI?
2009-12-20T00:56:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I am using Ion3 so I can fire up any part of Ubuntu's graphical user interface
2009-12-20T00:57:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	I know nothing about Ion3 - but if there is no graphical display *right now*, where should the poor system diplay its windows?
2009-12-20T00:58:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I have Xorg running successfully. I have graphics otherwise working properly.
2009-12-20T00:59:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	yes of course - but right now you switched to a virtual console - right?
2009-12-20T01:01:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I am now in a virtual console.
2009-12-20T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	to have access to your graphical display you must open a terminal within the gui (go to applications/accessories/terminal)
2009-12-20T01:06:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	I have the terminal open
2009-12-20T01:06:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	and then to open the pdf...let's see
2009-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	Thank you!
2009-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	soopos	guntbert	It works :)
2009-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	guntbert	soopos	glad to help :-)
