2007-01-29T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	cp -a
2007-01-29T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	ln -s
2007-01-29T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	what exactly did you do?
2007-01-29T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	does /media/sdb1/dists/edgy already exist?
2007-01-29T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	that is why
2007-01-29T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	use -f too, see 'man ln'
2007-01-29T06:20:00.000Z	Polarity	jrib	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
2007-01-29T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	if a file foo exists, you can't overwite it using ln unless you pass the -f switch
2007-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	ok, what are you trying to do now and what is the problem?
2007-01-29T06:25:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	right, what part
2007-01-29T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	it says "You don't need to copy the symlinked folders over (/dists/stable, /dists/unstable, /ubuntu) - bernstein"
2007-01-29T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	it's right above "Making the pendrive bootable"
2007-01-29T06:30:00.000Z	Polarity	jrib	On the editing syslinux.cfg part of the guide, what does it mean by adapt?
2007-01-29T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	Polarity	modify I guess.  Probably not a native speaker
