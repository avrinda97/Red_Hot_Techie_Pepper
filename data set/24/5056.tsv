2012-07-17T22:32:00.000Z	sophie_		why is sudo update-grub replying: "grub probe: can't find a device for /. Is grub mounted ?"
2012-07-17T22:34:00.000Z	sophie_		which partition ?
2012-07-17T22:34:00.000Z	sophie_		this is a live cd we're talking about
2012-07-17T22:35:00.000Z	sophie_		I have a few. and a few disks too, to make it more complicated
2012-07-17T22:36:00.000Z	sophie_		why is sudo update-grub replying: "grub probe: can't find a device for /. Is grub mounted ?"
2012-07-17T22:37:00.000Z	sophie_		yes
2012-07-17T22:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sophie_	Could you give a brief recap of your issue?
2012-07-17T22:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sophie_	Note that update-grub just updates the grub.cfg, it doesn't install grub. To run update-grub from a LiveCD/USB you'll need to chroot into your installed system first.
2012-07-17T22:39:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	so is that what I need to do ?
2012-07-17T22:39:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	or is it just the right tool for my issue ?
2012-07-17T22:39:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	or is it just *not* the right tool for my issue ?
2012-07-17T22:41:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	my issue is simple, I can't boot into any OS (I have 2, windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 desktop 64b). It was working before, and I didn't change anything regarding this. I didn't install a new hdd or anything. The computer was shut down by force. And the file system where / and /home (it's the same partition) might be full.
2012-07-17T22:42:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	and yeah, even grub doesn't show.
2012-07-17T22:42:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	and I'm logged into a live cd, and waiting for instructions.
2012-07-17T22:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sophie_	Please run boot info script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt that it produces.
2012-07-17T22:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sophie_	Did you see my request for you to run boot info script?
2012-07-17T22:59:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	yes that's what I was doing the whole time, it takes a while. There it is : http://pastebin.com/iQUYKU10
2012-07-17T23:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sophie_	Follow this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#ChRoot
2012-07-17T23:09:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	so, I tried what you said.
2012-07-17T23:10:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	first of all there's something weird, it can't find sda5 but if I remember correctly that's where ubuntu is (though I might be mistaken). so if I try just mount /dev/sda5 /mnt, it says not found.
2012-07-17T23:11:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	and second, if I try just mount /dev/sda1 /mnt, it asks me to specify the file system. That's probably because it's a file system not known to ubuntu, which is of no surprise since that's not (as far as I remember) where linux is.
2012-07-17T23:12:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	and third
2012-07-17T23:13:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	well there's no third, but I was always told there must be a third, so...
2012-07-17T23:19:00.000Z	sophie_	Jordan_U	are you gone?
