2006-06-13T14:56:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	what EXACTLY are you trying to do?
2006-06-13T14:57:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	that would be your usb key, correct?
2006-06-13T14:59:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	okay. well, you could either try "chmod a+rw /path/to/mounted/drive/ -R" or, do it a little bit dirtier, unmount the driver, do "chmod a+rw /dev/sda1" and then remount the drive.
2006-06-13T15:00:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	but you would have to run those commands as "sudo"
2006-06-13T15:01:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	more power to ya ... when you get used to it, the command line is an EXTREMELY useful tool.
2006-06-13T15:02:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	that's one of my beefs with windows, is that they should encourage users (especially power users) to take to the CLI
2006-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	yeah. the "/path/to/mounted/drive" is supposed to be "/mnt/mounted folder" or "/media/drive" or something like that. give me the output of "ls /media"
2006-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	brb ... I'll be back in about 5 mins.
2006-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	k. I'm back
2006-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	okay, try : sudo chmod a+rw /path/to/mounted/drive/ -R
2006-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	er wait :P
2006-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	okay, try : sudo chmod a+rw /media/sda1 -R
2006-06-13T15:13:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	there ya go. I take it you run a SCSI drive then?
2006-06-13T15:14:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	there ya go ... I guess SATA registers as a SCSI drive, just like a USB hard drive or pen drive will.
2006-06-13T15:18:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	it's no problem. I know the feeling :)
2006-06-13T15:18:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	I only switched to linux about 5 years ago.
2006-06-13T15:18:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	practice. use it a lot, try to do "new and interesting" things.
2006-06-13T15:20:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	yeah, but once you get used to it, you realize how logical it is.
2006-06-13T15:43:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	image?
2006-06-13T15:44:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	forgive me, but I still don't remember.
2006-06-13T15:45:00.000Z	CrippsFX	suprchris	I don't think that was me ... but it *is* a nice diagram ... I think I'll keep a copy ;)
