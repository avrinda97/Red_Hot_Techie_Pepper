2007-02-19T06:18:00.000Z	Gerry_W		How would I create a separate partition for /media now that ubuntu is already installed? GParted (inside the ubuntu livecd) does not assign partitions to directories.
2007-02-19T06:19:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	no, you would be th eone to do that, as it would have to guess, which it won't (and can't)
2007-02-19T06:20:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	it's *not* a partition now, so there is nothing to enlarge.. get you definitions straight first
2007-02-19T06:20:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	regardless, what he said ^^^
2007-02-19T06:21:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	if you want to have extra partitions, of course you'll have to make them first
2007-02-19T06:23:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	it gives me an error
2007-02-19T06:23:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	e/g /home/FolderName
2007-02-19T06:23:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	you have to be root
2007-02-19T06:23:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	I believe I sudo'd it
2007-02-19T06:23:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	let me try again.
2007-02-19T06:26:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	with reason :)
2007-02-19T06:27:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	thanks for the informative remark. :)
2007-02-19T06:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	come now, what's the status ?
2007-02-19T06:28:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	give me a sec. I'll try to sort things out.
2007-02-19T06:33:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	could you clarify this, por favor? In the command "sudo mount file.iso /media/iso/ -t iso9660 -o loop," this will mount the iso in /media/iso, correct? And this will take up space in /media, correct? And how does it know where the iso is located (does it have to be placed on the desktop)? Yes, of course I was referring to the Windows program. I'm a recent convert to Ubuntu. :D
2007-02-19T06:33:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	no, it will not take up any space
2007-02-19T06:33:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	ah. good. therein lay my misconception.
2007-02-19T06:33:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	and you have to ipoint to the ISO file, nothing on Linux will *guess* for you
2007-02-19T06:34:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	I suspected as much.
2007-02-19T06:34:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	Flannel: yeah, I just realized that. Give me a break. I've only been at it a week. :D
2007-02-19T06:35:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	mount -t iso9660  (or ufs) -o loop /path/and/file.name /mount/point <- there is no other way, no shortcut, no better way
2007-02-19T06:35:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	yup
2007-02-19T06:35:00.000Z	adaptr	Gerry_W	putting options before arguments is good practice in Linux, and often required, as well - so get used to it now :)
2007-02-19T06:37:00.000Z	Gerry_W	adaptr	ok, thanks
