2006-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	sobersabre		I once installed a package named 'kubuntu-desktop'
2006-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	sobersabre		this made the usplash image to be blue.
2006-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	sobersabre		by default it has been brown.
2006-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	sobersabre		then I did the same with xubuntu-desktop
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		then the boot image was gray
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		I want the boot image to be brown again.
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		how do I achieve this ?
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor fdisk ?
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor r do you mean the 'logical volume manager' ?
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	torpor	sobersabre	i don't know what i mean, i just remember that there was some GUI tool for formatting a newly added disk to the system ..
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor there's gparted - a partition editor with GUI
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	torpor		and this lets me format, etc?
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		it also allows to format the partitions you create with it
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	torpor		thanks.
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	torpor		i'll look it up and use it ..
