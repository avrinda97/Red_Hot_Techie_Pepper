2008-12-15T05:52:00.000Z	mrwes		Win XP runs nicely in VirtualBox on my 8.04 box

2008-12-15T05:56:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	would it be better to use Ubuntu as host and WinXP as client then? What do you think about the spec? 1GB ram and 1.6Ghz single core atom?
2008-12-15T05:57:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	I run XP in VB with 512mb of ram, and I have a total of 2gb of ram
2008-12-15T05:57:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	also, I made a 10gb virtual drive
2008-12-15T05:59:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	ok, do you run Ubuntu as host? What CPU do you have?
2008-12-15T05:59:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	yah, ubuntu 8.04 as the host with an AMD +3200
2008-12-15T06:00:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	it's an old HP and XP runs fine with that setup in a VB
2008-12-15T06:01:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	ok, a tad more muscles than an atom 1.6Ghz then. :-) How much ram does Ubuntu typically use? Do you think I could manage by splitting 1GB into 50/50 for host and client.
2008-12-15T06:01:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	hrmm...that should run Ok
2008-12-15T06:02:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	fire it up and find out :)
2008-12-15T06:03:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	I have not bought the Acer yet. :-) Being able to run VB is crucial for me. (so you are actually contributing a lot to my decision right now :-))
2008-12-15T06:04:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	you have some win apps you must run?
2008-12-15T06:04:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	I'm afraid I will have in the near future. A VPN client for example. :-(
2008-12-15T06:05:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	:-)
2008-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	and the Im unsure if all HW in the ACER is fully supported by Ubuntu. 3G-modem for example.
2008-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	I only use win in a  VB to run Auto Gordian Knot and some web sites that balk at Firefox Linux
2008-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	ok
2008-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	dunno about that...
2008-12-15T06:07:00.000Z	spunk	mrwes	Well then. There is only one way to really find out I guess... :-) Anyway, thanks for your help!
2008-12-15T06:07:00.000Z	mrwes	spunk	no problem
