2006-07-05T15:15:00.000Z	Ackeubu_		hey guys my e-gnome is broken.. ( can i fix it in some easy way? reinstalling?
2006-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Mine works
2006-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	What did you do?
2006-07-05T15:20:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Try running it manually. The way to do this is to go to a console, stop gdm (sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop) then start an X server with "X -ac :0" then, in another console, do "export DISPLAY=localhost:0" then "export WINDOW_MANAGER=enlightenment" then "gnome-session". That should work
2006-07-05T15:21:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	This is just the /usr/bin/starte16 script, yes?
2006-07-05T15:22:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	tell you what, try logging into regualr GNOME, go into preferences>session and make metacity a regular process (not restart) then stop it and run enlightenment from a terminal, see if that works
2006-07-05T15:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	OK, so it is probably the script. Try "cat /usr/bin/starte16"
2006-07-05T15:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	It should basically do (for GNOME) WINDOW_MANAGER=enlightenment then gnome-session. That is all it should need to do
2006-07-05T15:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Yes, so it is OK. Hmm, why isn;t it logging in? This is puzzling
2006-07-05T15:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	If you try the method I said before about using consoles then you are manually doing what the script should be doing
2006-07-05T15:31:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Maybe try running an X then "starte16 GNOME"
2006-07-05T15:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	(bear in mind that I am using a newer version of e16 than is in Ubuntu, but the Ubuntu version worked fine for me anyway)
2006-07-05T15:43:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Do "export DISPLAY-localhost:0" then either un "starte16 GNOME" or do "export WINDOW_MANAGER=enlightenment" "gnome-session" yourself
2006-07-23T13:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Uninstall e16, since Ubuntu's version just calls itself "enlightenment", so that may be conflicting
2006-07-23T13:24:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	okay. so would i have to reinstall E17 after that?
2006-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	I don't know
2006-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	okay thanks.
2006-07-24T07:55:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	There is an Ubuntu repository for E17 somewhere...
2006-07-24T07:57:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	ill just comment away locateecho and hope it doesnt do anything...
2006-07-24T07:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Maybe you screwed your system by commenting out lines in install scripts? :)
2006-07-24T07:59:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	hahaha
2006-07-24T08:01:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	but it has to be possilble to comment out obscure coomands such as locateecho. commands that are not even googleable......
2006-07-24T08:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Ackeubu_	Read through the script and see what it is trying to do, then do it yourself manually. A) You'll learn and B) You shouldn't screw anything up
2006-07-24T08:03:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	Warbo	 will do unless it goes through now..
