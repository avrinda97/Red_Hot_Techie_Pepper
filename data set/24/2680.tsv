2008-10-09T01:33:00.000Z	zebralinux		how can i get my Desktop directory back ????? anyone...
2008-10-09T01:35:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	mkdir ~/Desktop
2008-10-09T01:35:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 is that that different from: cd /home/my_username ; mkdir Desktop ??
2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 now all shortcuts will end up in home directory
2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	Yes, it's the same as cd ~; mkdir Desktop
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	(~ is the same as /home/current_user)
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 can u try to delete your Desktop icon
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 and then recreate it

2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	I just told you mkdir ~/Desktop recreates it
2008-10-09T01:38:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 why dont shortcuts created on to desktop end up in Desktop ??
2008-10-09T01:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	I don't know what you mean...desktop icons end up on desktop, yeah

2008-10-09T01:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	...why
2008-10-09T01:39:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 rename your Desktop directory
2008-10-09T01:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	No
2008-10-09T01:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	You're asking me to do something, for no reason, which serves no purpose, without giving me a reason
2008-10-09T01:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	No, thanks
2008-10-09T01:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman	zebralinux	I've told you if you deleted your desktop, then mkdir ~/Desktop to get it back
2008-10-09T01:43:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 ok but that will recreate the directory but not its functionallity
2008-10-09T01:43:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	 If you look att the directory in nautilus u see it has a special emblem on it
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	zebralinux	dmsuperman	how to get that ??
