2008-10-04T23:39:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	32 or 64bit/
2008-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	in firefox's address bar type in: about:plugins
2008-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	see if you have Shockwave Flash.... and what version if found
2008-10-04T23:49:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	so how you doing with that flash?
2008-10-04T23:50:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	install flashplugin-nonfree, then go to adobe.com and download flash 9
2008-10-04T23:51:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	then you will need to replace the flash plugin installed by apt with the one from adobe
2008-10-04T23:51:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	apt-get installs flash 10 which a lot of web sites do not recognize yet
2008-10-04T23:52:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	it's easier to communicate if you prefix you message with the nick of the person you want to msg
2008-10-04T23:53:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	on a busy channel your message can get easily get lost
2008-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	start typing the nick of the person you intend to msg and press Tab it will autocomplete the nick for you
2008-10-04T23:54:00.000Z	w_nicram	Jay	see.... very good
