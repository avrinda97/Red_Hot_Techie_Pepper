2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		when i open emacs i get the following error:
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		$ emacs
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*" to type FontStruct
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		Warning: Cannot convert string "-*-helvetica-medium-r-*--*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1" to type FontStruct
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		i think it has something to do with xfonts75 and xfonts100 not being in my xorg.conf or something
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		i remade my xorg.conf using fglrxconfig
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		so its very possible
2005-11-05T08:58:00.000Z	PuGz		can anyone suggest the actual lines to add to my xorg.conf?
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	ryanmt	PuGz	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3834 theres my xconf.org if thats any use
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	hehe... thats funny... i was gonna help you with your problem!
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	PuGz		cheers for that
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	ryanmt		./RealPlayer10GOLD.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	ryanmt		thats the whole error
2005-11-05T09:01:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	firstly, is that the xorg.conf made by the ubuntu installer?
2005-11-05T09:01:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	try this:
2005-11-05T09:01:00.000Z	PuGz		sudo aptitude install libstdc++5
2005-11-05T09:02:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	work?
2005-11-05T09:02:00.000Z	ryanmt		yup, cheers
2005-11-05T09:02:00.000Z	PuGz		no probs
2005-11-05T09:02:00.000Z	ryanmt		what does the aptitude bit mean btw ive not see that used before
2005-11-05T09:03:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	realplayer was obviously built against that version of the c++ libraries... there are newer versions out, which you would have had installed... but you needed the old ones to run that version of realplayer
2005-11-05T09:03:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	aptitude is an apt-get replacement
2005-11-05T09:03:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	aptitude also replaces apt-cache
2005-11-05T09:03:00.000Z	PuGz	ryanmt	type aptitude help or man aptitude
