2010-07-01T20:43:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	I'm sorry, I'm busy here with work outside of IRC.  Perhaps someone else here can help.
2010-07-01T20:43:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	okay. thanks anyway
2010-07-01T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	Please take a look at http://apt.alturl.com/ enter your version of Ubuntu, which architecture (probably i386), and vlc as the package you need to install.  If you have Ubuntu installed you can should enter ubuntu-desktop in the last textbox.  That will give you all the packages you need to download to install vlc on another computer.
2010-07-01T21:05:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	i found vlc-data, libvlccore2, libvlc2, vlc-nox, and vlc. u want me to download all those deb?
2010-07-01T21:06:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	and i already did that.. i installed 4 of them, and now there is problem with installing vlc-nox..
2010-07-01T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	I get a much larger list of packages if I use that url that I gave you.
2010-07-01T21:08:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	u want me to install all of them?
2010-07-01T21:08:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	Yes, those are all the dependencies that VLC requires.
2010-07-01T21:09:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	OMG !
2010-07-01T21:09:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	isn't there is a easy way?
2010-07-01T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	Not if you don't have an internet connection on that computer, sorry.
2010-07-01T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	Those are all the packages that would be installed if you did 'apt-get install vlc' on a computer that did have internet access.
2010-07-01T21:11:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	well trying now.. pray... :(
2010-07-01T21:26:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	how to install all of those.. i have to double click every file one by one?
2010-07-01T21:27:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	The easiest way is to put them all in one folder, then from a terminal: sudo dpkg -i /path/to/files/*.deb
2010-07-01T21:27:00.000Z	Tanvir	Pici	okay.. IdleOne yes

2010-08-10T16:39:00.000Z	Pici	Tanvir	You'll need to provide us with the URL that the pastebin gives you.
