2008-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	sadhermit		is there a way to manually update apt-cache
2008-06-29T13:37:00.000Z	sadhermit		i need to update the apt-cache of an offline machine
2008-06-29T13:37:00.000Z	sadhermit		because i'd like to use the "download script generation" feature of synaptic
2008-06-29T13:37:00.000Z	sadhermit		but i need a package in universe
2008-06-29T13:38:00.000Z	sadhermit		and i can't find a way to update the list of packages to include universe
2008-06-29T13:39:00.000Z	ompaul	sadhermit	connect it to the internet? the contents of /var/cache/apt are what you are looking for
2008-06-29T13:39:00.000Z	sadhermit	ompaul	i can't connect it to the internet in any way
2008-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	ompaul	sadhermit	then the answer is take it from another similar build machine
2008-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	sadhermit	ompaul	this is what i'm trying  to do
2008-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	sadhermit		but i need to update the list of packages
2008-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	ompaul	sadhermit	connect it to the internet? the contents of /var/cache/apt <<<<< you need to tar that up and bring it from box one to box two

2008-06-29T13:42:00.000Z	sadhermit	ompaul	i thought i could download the lists from the repositories
