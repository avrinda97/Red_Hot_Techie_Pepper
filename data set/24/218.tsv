2012-10-31T03:59:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	browsing with your file manager and the drag/droping to your player is what you want?
2012-10-31T03:59:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	yeah, that or some way within the program to browse the filesystem, but it seems that audacious, which was my first choise cant to that with files from a samba share
2012-10-31T04:00:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	ok, i get it now
2012-10-31T04:01:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	and your server is linux as well?
2012-10-31T04:02:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	i think so, it's some generic NAS
2012-10-31T04:03:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	can you ssh to that thing?
2012-10-31T04:03:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	 nope :(
2012-10-31T04:05:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	like http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/mounting-a-samba-share-933322/
2012-10-31T04:05:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	i got it mounted, but audacious doesnt support adding folders from samba shares, this only works with normal files
2012-10-31T04:06:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	fstab
2012-10-31T04:07:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	perhaps run yourplayer from cli and then drop that share and see if any errors pop out
2012-10-31T04:07:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	would be worth a try
2012-10-31T04:08:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	nope
2012-10-31T04:09:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	but you can see this files normaly with some file manager? copy them localy and so on?
2012-10-31T04:09:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	yes, all that works fine, it just seems that audacious doesnt support adding directorys from samba shares
2012-10-31T04:11:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	perhaps try "deadbeef" as plazer, very similar.
2012-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	is there a recent ppa for deadbeef?
2012-10-31T04:15:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	iam using deb-multimedia.org
2012-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	okay
2012-10-31T04:19:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	deadbeef seems nice, but the gui is ugly ;)
2012-10-31T04:19:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	does it work? evev if ugly
2012-10-31T04:20:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	yeah
2012-10-31T04:21:00.000Z	stephanb	brontosaurusrex	but i got a workaround with gvfs so that it works with audacious too
2012-10-31T04:21:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	stephanb	cool
