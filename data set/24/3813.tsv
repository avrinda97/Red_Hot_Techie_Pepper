2007-10-09T16:48:00.000Z	Negra		The source of my problem is that I do a decent amount of PC gaming, and as much as I a loving Linux (I will never understand why I never tried it sooner) windows is for the moment home for real PC Gaming, for many reasons even with wine been able to run some games decently I would prefer the full gaming experience on windows (EAX, Great performance, Raid and other reasons) now I usw windows for gaming almost exclusuvelly bu I would 
2007-10-09T16:50:00.000Z	Negra		OK so Its racomended to dith fake raid altogether but is it possible to dual boot win/LNX both on Software Raid?
2007-10-09T16:51:00.000Z	Negra		so how would you call it then Real RAID?
2007-10-09T16:51:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	you'll have a hard time getting linux to even install on a fakeraid setup (i.e. setup in bios on newer motherboards)
2007-10-09T16:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	real raid is referred to as hardware raid, and you will hardly ever find those except on server machines
2007-10-09T16:53:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	I have a Asus Crosshair Mobo with intergrated RAID
2007-10-09T16:54:00.000Z	Negra		and Im trying to dual boot vista and  Ubuntu in a way that both OS's have raid
2007-10-09T16:54:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	I have a Gigabyte board that has integrated RAID as well...but i found out that its not actually hardware raid, its just configurable in BIOS, but it requires a windows driver to interpret it
2007-10-09T16:55:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	i tried to folow this guide, and i eventually gave up https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
2007-10-09T16:56:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	same for me, so is there a way to have both OS's runing raid in a dual boot setup I tried the fake raid thingy  but its proving quite challenging and I open for alternatives
2007-10-09T16:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	i would say try and setup your motherboard raid using half-disk partitions on both drives, and then use ubuntu's softraid
2007-10-09T16:57:00.000Z	Evanlec		on the other half
2007-10-09T16:58:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	yup yup I tried that one to and now im at the point where you were right before you gave up
2007-10-09T16:58:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	what point is that?
2007-10-09T16:59:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	the point were I seek an alternative before giving up and intall LNX in a separate disk and just dow fake raid in windows
2007-10-09T05:00:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	there's a difference between the fakeraid that ur motherboard comes with and the softraid that linux does
2007-10-09T05:02:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	what would that difference be
2007-10-09T05:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	difference is if u setup raid in linux, its much less complicated
2007-10-09T05:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	tho i havent tried it yet, this is my plan when i install gutsy
2007-10-09T05:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	http://www.howtoforge.com/linux_software_raid
2007-10-09T05:04:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	yup but then my windows (gaiming) wont have Raid right?
2007-10-09T05:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	i believe if u partition it correctly u can have both...i dont know tho, that does sound a little tricky
2007-10-09T05:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	Negra	i've decided to just let windows not have raid...i do use it for gaming but...i havent booted it in 3 weeks lol
2007-10-09T05:06:00.000Z	Negra	Evanlec	I velieve thats what im goint to have to do.
