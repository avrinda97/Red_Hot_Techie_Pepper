2010-03-11T02:37:00.000Z	embrik		trying to install alfresco in ubuntu hardy server and need sun-java6-jdk. I am not able to install the jdk package. Why not?
2010-03-11T02:37:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	enable multiverse repository and then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
2010-03-11T02:43:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	thanks, thought I had uncommentet the multiverse repo - but I hadn't
2010-03-11T02:43:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	:-) now its working?
2010-03-11T02:43:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	Yes
2010-03-11T02:45:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	can I copy a blueray disk as well
2010-03-11T02:45:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	not directly because of copy protection
2010-03-11T02:46:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	if you mean a movie
2010-03-11T02:46:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	is it possible to rip a blueray then?
2010-03-11T02:47:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	yes
2010-03-11T02:47:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	with a normal dvd-player and say, acidrip?
2010-03-11T02:47:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	no, never saw a dvd-player which can read blu-ray
2010-03-11T02:49:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	yes
2010-03-11T02:49:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	what about using real questions instead of "anyone"?
2010-03-11T02:54:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	I need to find a substitute for MS Sharepoint - haven't much knowledge about MS sharepoint - but have ordered a book on it - I want to find a good alternative in open source
2010-03-11T02:55:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	but I don't know if alfresco is anything like sharepoint
2010-03-11T02:55:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	not really like sharepoint
2010-03-11T02:56:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	there is a openoffice-plugin for alfrescxo for using something like sharepint but the plugin is out of date and not working anymore
2010-03-11T02:56:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	ok do you know about anything in open source doing tha same or almost the same as sharepoint?
2010-03-11T02:57:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	sorry dont know, maybe its a bad answer but tried google?
2010-03-11T02:58:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	that's how I found alfresco - I've left a question on a debian-edu.list - I may get some answers there
2010-03-11T02:59:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	alfresco is ok but nothing on sharepoint (imo)
2010-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	embrik	iceroot	are you sure the OO-plugin doesn't work - google seems to give me alfresco as the only alternative to sharepoint
2010-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	iceroot	embrik	when i was testing it with oo 3.x it was not working, just with oo 2.4 (2 months ago)
