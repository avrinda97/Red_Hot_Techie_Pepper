2009-09-04T14:13:00.000Z	DDT		Hi. Is Ubuntu good to host VMware virtual computers? Thx
2009-09-04T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	its fine
2009-09-04T14:15:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- what should I use. Desktop edition or Server edition? Are both for free? Thx.
2009-09-04T14:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	both are free
2009-09-04T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	if the system is a genuine server and not to be touched much, use server, otherwise use desktop
2009-09-04T14:16:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- great, thank you. I need use it as server for virtual computers.
2009-09-04T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	you dont need to, its just advisd as you'll have more resources or your VMs
2009-09-04T14:18:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- I need more resources for my virtual computers. I have only 2GB Ram and I need run 2-3 virtual machines.
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- I hope that server edition has kde or gnome too - not only command line.
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	then server for sure
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	the server only has command line
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	if you need a desktop, install desktop
2009-09-04T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	yes, only. true servers dont have desktops
2009-09-04T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	you want the desktop install if you cant configure the system via command line
2009-09-04T14:20:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- Yes, I am afraid I need sometimes desktop too. Because I am not very familiar with command line only.
2009-09-04T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	then desktop for you, install xubuntu to make it a little lighter
2009-09-04T14:21:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- xubuntu? its clon? Is it 100% compatibile with ubuntu?
2009-09-04T14:22:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- I mean if I will need some help with xubuntu Can I ask here?
2009-09-04T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	sure, as well as #xubuntu
2009-09-04T14:23:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- Great! Going to download it. Thank you. :)
2009-09-04T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	remember to md5 check stuff
2009-09-04T14:24:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- md5? what for?
2009-09-04T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DDT	make sure the data is complete and error free
2009-09-04T14:24:00.000Z	DDT	ActionParsnip	- ohh yes :) I will. Thx again. See you.
