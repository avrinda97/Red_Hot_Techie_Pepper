2005-09-13T14:55:00.000Z	GregAsche		is there a way to make links clickable in the gnome terminal?
2005-09-13T14:56:00.000Z	GregAsche		what do you mean Kyral?
2005-09-13T14:56:00.000Z	GregAsche		i want to make it so that I can double click URLs that show up in the terminal and have them open in firefox
2005-09-13T14:57:00.000Z	GregAsche		sorry, my first question was confusing
2005-09-13T14:57:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	i have an answer for you
2005-09-13T14:57:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	install links2 and run it with "links -g" and you can click links in the gnome terminal (in more ways than one)
2005-09-13T15:01:00.000Z	GregAsche	nalioth	links -g doesn't work
2005-09-13T15:01:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	did you install links2 ?
2005-09-13T15:02:00.000Z	GregAsche	nalioth	yes
2005-09-13T15:02:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	hmm, interesting
2005-09-13T15:04:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	if you'd like to compile it with graphics and javascipt capabilities, grab it from here http://links.twibright.com/  , run ./configure --help  , enable the things you want and drive on
2005-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	sure. just add one
2005-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	right click on the panel
2005-10-04T15:58:00.000Z	GregAsche	nalioth	I don't see anything to add a second one
2005-10-04T15:58:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	"add to panel" > clock
2005-10-04T15:59:00.000Z	GregAsche	nalioth	thanks
2005-10-25T15:12:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	cuz you probably havent upgraded
2005-10-25T15:14:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	change them to archive.bleh
2005-10-25T15:14:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	the us archives seem to be having trouble again
2005-10-25T15:14:00.000Z	GregAsche	nalioth	won't it not upgrade if I do that?
2005-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	it will upgrade if you remove the us. from in front of your URLs in your sources.list
2005-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	just update again, and dist-upgrade
2005-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	yes please
2005-10-25T15:34:00.000Z	nalioth	GregAsche	sounds about right
