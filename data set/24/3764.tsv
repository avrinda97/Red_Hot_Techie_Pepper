2007-10-20T06:01:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	did u get compiz fusion to work?
2007-10-20T06:02:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	nope.. =(
2007-10-20T06:02:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	whenever I install xserver-glx the problems start.. and compiz still wont start
2007-10-20T06:03:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	with ur system up-to-date?
2007-10-20T06:03:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	update manager doesnt have anything more to update.. yes
2007-10-20T06:04:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	that's odd...alot of people today got it working just by doing that :o!
2007-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	if I try doing glrxinfo.. gnome blacks out on me and restart
2007-10-20T06:06:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	humn...no idea why ur getting that prob :o
2007-10-20T06:14:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	did u actually did "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"?
2007-10-20T06:15:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	did u actually do!lol
2007-10-20T06:15:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	no I checked the box in synaptic and did it that way..
2007-10-20T06:15:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	try doing that in the terminal!"sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"!
2007-10-20T06:15:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	I think u need to enable ur restricted drivers and the system has to be up-to-date
2007-10-20T06:16:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	restricted are enabled right now and working green.. system is up to date also.. it is a clean install from beginning of gutsy also.. not an upgrade
2007-10-20T06:17:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	could it be a problem the drivers are isntalled.. I mean maybe it goes wrong if installing fglrx before xserver-xgl, than other way around?
2007-10-20T06:17:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	then try that in the terminal, u wont lose anything.lol
2007-10-20T06:17:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	just my sanity.. been trying for 8 hours or so now.. probably 10 :D
2007-10-20T06:18:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	btw.. why does my gnome die right off if I do fglrxinfo?
2007-10-20T06:18:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	no idea! :o
2007-10-20T06:19:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	if I try aticonfig it will coredump and have xorg.conf dissapear as well.. funny problems here :)
2007-10-20T06:19:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	if ur having that much problems with ur gnome, u can always try reinstalling it :o
2007-10-20T06:19:00.000Z	garu_	Cryoniq	funny indeed :o!:)
2007-10-20T06:19:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	hmm yeah.. this one is installed from the desktop iso..
2007-10-20T06:20:00.000Z	Cryoniq	garu_	I heard there is an alternate iso also.. what is different between them?
