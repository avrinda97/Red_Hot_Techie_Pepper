2006-05-20T15:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	lsmod |grep ^snd_opl3sa2
2006-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	type the command I gave you into a Terminal, and tell me the result
2006-05-20T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	what does ``sudo modprobe snd_opl3sa2'' return?
2006-05-20T15:26:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	snd_opl3sa2, not snd:opl3sa2
2006-05-20T15:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	great. What's the output from ``cat /proc/asound/cards''?
2006-05-20T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	pastebin it.
2006-05-20T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	essentially, but I would have preferred pastebin. No big deal.
2006-05-20T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	pastebin the output from ``amixer -c0''
2006-05-20T15:38:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	paste the output onto that Web site and tell me the url of your paste
2006-05-20T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	in a Web browser, go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-05-20T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	take the output from the command I gave you, and paste it into the text entry field, then click Send
2006-05-20T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	then tell me the url
2006-05-20T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	does the following command give you audible volume? ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
2006-05-20T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	yes, it works fine. Now type this in a Terminal: echo snd-opl3sa2 |sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2006-05-20T15:51:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	come again?
2006-05-20T15:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	oh, the |  ? That's a pipe character. Shift+backslash.
2006-05-20T15:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	np
2006-05-20T15:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	that should have been a continuous string: "snd-opl3sa2"
2006-05-20T15:57:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	then you're all set
2006-05-20T15:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	yes.
2006-05-21T16:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	you'd be surprised, actually.
2006-05-21T16:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Mynthon	quite a few Ubuntu users in Oslo, I'm sure.
