2012-03-02T20:21:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	you might have a look here: http://bashish.sourceforge.net/
2012-03-02T20:24:00.000Z	mi3	sipior	I cant download the deb file from the site it shows some kind of an error maybe you can suggest some other way
2012-03-02T20:26:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	the build docs are pretty explicit: http://bashish.sourceforge.net/doc.html
2012-03-02T20:27:00.000Z	mi3	sipior	it has got nothing about ps1 or similar thing and I cant even download the deb file!
2012-03-02T20:29:00.000Z	mi3		what is zsh aaGp? will those scripts work on ubuntu in the 1st place?
2012-03-02T20:29:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	looks like the package link is broken. try downloading the source code, and building that. (it doesn't appear to be in the common repositories)
2012-03-02T20:30:00.000Z	mi3	sipior	now thats really interesting..
2012-03-02T20:31:00.000Z	mi3		never compiled a source code before but the docs speak 4 themselves thanks sipior and aaGp
2012-03-02T20:31:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	yep, have fun.
2012-03-02T20:32:00.000Z	mi3	sipior	a question, the imagebin link that i posted on this irc, u must have seen it, was this done on ubuntu?
2012-03-02T20:32:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	i don't know.
2012-03-02T20:33:00.000Z	mi3	sipior	can you share your .bashrc file with me?
2012-03-02T20:33:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	it's not very exciting.
2012-03-02T20:33:00.000Z	mi3		is it similar to that one? sipior?
2012-03-02T20:34:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	no, it isn't.
2012-03-02T20:34:00.000Z	mi3		ok
2012-03-02T20:34:00.000Z	sipior	mi3	here's my fancy prompt: "tanelorn:~ sipior$ "
2012-03-02T20:35:00.000Z	mi3		not much, ehh?? still its good 4 u sipior :)
