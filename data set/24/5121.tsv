2006-10-22T05:44:00.000Z	kane77		hi
2006-10-22T05:46:00.000Z	kane77		how do I set the screen resolution to STAY at what I want it... in gnome it's no problem, but in fluxbox I set it to 1024*768 but next time its set back to 1280x1024...
2006-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and remove 1280x1024
2006-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	assuming you don't need it of course
2006-10-22T05:48:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	thanx, i basicaly dont need it... the refresh rate is 60Hz so I dont like it very much
2006-10-22T05:50:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	accept the default and move on
2006-10-22T05:50:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	you only need to change the resolution settings - accept defaults for all the other questions
2006-10-22T05:51:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	yes
2006-10-22T05:51:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	 "accept all the defaults except the one you are changing"
2006-10-22T05:58:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	thx now its OK :D :D :D
2006-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	 enjoy :)
2006-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	fluxbox FTW !
2006-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	where did you learn all this stuff?
2006-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	misspent middle age ;)
2006-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	so i still have time ;D
2006-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	I'm here under false pretences actually - my usual nick is thoreauputic
2006-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	luckily for all present I don't have ops on this install ... yet
2006-10-22T06:01:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	I just downloaded some linuxCBT's on debian, hope that it will help me gain skills...
2006-10-22T06:02:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	anything about debian is pretty much transferable to Ubuntu
2006-10-22T06:02:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	in terms of knowledge at least
2006-10-22T06:03:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	yes, that is mostly covering terminal use, commands and configuration so I guess its the same in ubuntu..
2006-10-22T06:04:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	sudo aptitude install apt-howto && apt-howto
2006-10-22T06:05:00.000Z	kane77	altereg0`	correct me, but I think ubuntu made gui for settings, but through terminal the use is same as in debian
2006-10-22T06:06:00.000Z	altereg0`	kane77	in general debian and ubuntu use the same CLI commands, yes
