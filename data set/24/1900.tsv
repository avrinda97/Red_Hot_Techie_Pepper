2009-06-30T23:49:00.000Z	Zopiac		how do i get me sound card to work?
2009-06-30T23:51:00.000Z	Zopiac		i just put in a soundblaster sound card, but when i booted up the computer there is no sound. hardware drivers shows no sound-related option, either.
2009-06-30T23:53:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	go to the terminal and try the command: alsamixer
2009-06-30T23:53:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	then what? the Card: says it is trying to use the onboard sound
2009-06-30T23:54:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	boot up the PC, enter the BIOS and turn off the onboard card
2009-06-30T23:54:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	you know how to enter the BIOS?
2009-06-30T23:58:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	it is still tryinh to use onboard
2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	i disabled what i could find. the only audio-related thing i found was HDaudio which could be Enabled or Disabled. i switched it from the former to the latter.
2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	thats High Definition, so.... i am quite sure it is not theswitch for the onboard sound card
2009-07-01T00:02:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	do you have the motherboard name and chipset at hand?
2009-07-01T00:04:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	ASUS M3A78-EM is the motherboard name
2009-07-01T00:04:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	hold the line ;)
2009-07-01T00:06:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	Realtek ALC1200 HD Audio 8-Channel
2009-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	all right, i just seen there is also another one
2009-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	is it possible that the onboard sound is somehow connected to the digital video?
2009-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	how do you mean?
2009-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	http://www.xbmc.org/forum/showthread.php?t=52201
2009-07-01T00:11:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	so what does that mean, that in order to disable the sound i need a seperate video card?
2009-07-01T00:12:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	_this_ i dont know, but it seems like only the SPDIF digital sound can be dis/enabled in the bios... sorry no idea
2009-07-01T00:13:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	you could check the HDMI settings in your BIOS
2009-07-01T00:13:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	ok, i will check my bios further
2009-07-01T00:14:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	so that you check if there is a way to disable digital audio of HDMI
2009-07-01T00:14:00.000Z	machinebacon	Zopiac	quite sure that the BIOS is the rotten fish
2009-07-01T00:18:00.000Z	Zopiac	machinebacon	there was an option for Audio within the Graphics settings in my bios. i disabled it as well, and now we'll see if it was what i needed :)
