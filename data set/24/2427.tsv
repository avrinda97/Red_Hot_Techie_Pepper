2008-12-24T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	XP or Vista?
2008-12-24T03:01:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	XP pro X64 edition
2008-12-24T03:03:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	ah ok, try #windows
2008-12-24T03:45:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	#windows couldn't help you resotre NTLDR?
2008-12-24T03:46:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	No.  They gave up because my windows disk doesnt prompt me to push r for recovery console and I did it manually via ubuntu but it didnt work.
2008-12-24T03:47:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	....
2008-12-24T03:48:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	yes?
2008-12-24T03:53:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	So do you have any idea of what I need to do to get this working>
2008-12-24T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	have you tried going through the installation phase and repairing it that way?
2008-12-24T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	i'm surprized they didn't know about that.
2008-12-24T03:55:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	What do you mean?  My windows disk will go all the way up to where I select the partition I want to install windows to but there is no repair option.
2008-12-24T03:57:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	okay, then you have to actually go through the install process - if all goes well, it should still be able to find the installation and repair it that way
2008-12-24T03:58:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	Will I lose my data on my windows  partition?
2008-12-24T03:58:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	shouldn't, but if you want to make sure, just mount it in ubuntu and backup
2008-12-24T03:59:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	What about the data on my other two drives will they be okay or will there be a risk that I may loose that data as well?
2008-12-24T04:00:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	the process only deals with c:
2008-12-24T04:00:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	okay
2008-12-24T05:29:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	Are you still here?
2008-12-24T05:29:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	for a bit
2008-12-24T05:29:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	 Okay so I backed up the data on my C drive and I need to do a reinstall right?
2008-12-24T05:31:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	basically, just go through the procedure - once you get to the hd partition, pay close attention to the options presented to you
2008-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	hashbrowns	Gnea	Okay, I chose the partition that windows was peviously installed on and now it either lets me delete the windows folder there or choose a different folder name or quit which should I do?
2008-12-24T05:34:00.000Z	Gnea	hashbrowns	you'd better pm me
