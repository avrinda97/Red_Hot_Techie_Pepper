2006-09-25T06:45:00.000Z	chuckyp		Really getting salty that I can't resize this ntfs partition.  I'm right clicking on it in gparted and the resize option is greyed out.
2006-09-25T06:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	did you make sure it isn't mounted?
2006-09-25T06:46:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	well If I unmount it.  Then gparted complains that it can't read the data.
2006-09-25T06:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	afaik you can't resize a partition while it's mounted - at least, you run all kinds of risks doing so
2006-09-25T06:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	I just umounted it then restarted gparted now it complains "Unable to read the filesystem.
2006-09-25T06:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	err read the contents of the filesytem.  Because of this some options may be unavailible Did you install the correct plugin for this filesystem?
2006-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	hmm - well I no longer use windows/ntfs so I guess I'm not much help - I assume it needs ntfs-utils or something of the kind
2006-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	thats what its saying if I click on information for the parition with it umounted and resize is still greyed out.
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	okay let me give ntfs-utils a try I assumed all would be kosher since I'm able to mount and use the partiton.
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic		ntfsprogs maybe
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic		apt-cach search ntfs
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic		* apt-cache search ntfs
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	yeah  I'm not that much of a noob i'll find it.
2006-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	brb
2006-09-25T06:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	OK :)
2006-09-25T06:53:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	yeap ntfsprogs did the trick,  well i'm sure it was one of the lib's that it installs actually but that worked ty.
2006-09-25T06:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	np :)
2006-09-25T06:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	Now i'm just working on creating a seperate /home So I can't keep all my stuff there.
2006-09-25T06:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	the main thing I had to remember when I reorganised my partitions was to re-organise grub and /etc/fstab :) Otherwise it was pretty much point and click
2006-09-25T06:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	yeah I know I need some really weird command to cp the files over because of all the .blah in ~
2006-09-25T06:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	chuckyp	 cp -a should cover it for the dot files
2006-09-25T06:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	argh have to reboot to windows complaining of ntfs cluster errors need to run chkdisk /f a few times first.
2006-09-25T06:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	thoreauputic	alright brb I thought most people were using cpio or something like that.
