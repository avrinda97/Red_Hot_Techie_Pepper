2007-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	LiraNuna		<SuperQ> tigran: you're writing a C++ app, and want to spawn a gnome-terminal?
2007-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	LiraNuna		eh
2007-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	LiraNuna		system("gnome-terminal");
2007-12-25T12:57:00.000Z	LiraNuna		?!
2007-12-25T12:58:00.000Z	tigran	LiraNuna	Well can I set it to run specific code, not just open a termianl
2007-12-25T12:58:00.000Z	tigran	LiraNuna	I need it to run a command auto
2007-12-25T12:58:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	what exactly do you want to do
2007-12-25T12:59:00.000Z	tigran	LiraNuna	I created a gui editor for a config file, and saving is the part I'm stuck. I can't write to /etc/. So I want to write it to a different location then copy that file to /etc/ using sudo in a terminal
2007-12-25T12:59:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	eh?!
2007-12-25T12:59:00.000Z	LiraNuna		you can't write to /etc/ because the app doesn't run on root
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	tigran		Oh, so if I give the app root privilage, it'll work?
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	use uid() function, if it's not 1000, user is not root
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	obviously
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	tigran		Yea :P
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	tigran		haha, I can just do that
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	tigran		I make stuff so complicated
2007-12-25T13:00:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	make sure to let the user know
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	tigran	LiraNuna	only user is gonna be me :P
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	tigran		and I know
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	LiraNuna		if(uid() != 1000) error("must run on root");
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	I see
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	it's still nice to share
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	tigran	LiraNuna	Thanks, and SuperQ
2007-12-25T13:01:00.000Z	LiraNuna	tigran	sudo ./yourapp
