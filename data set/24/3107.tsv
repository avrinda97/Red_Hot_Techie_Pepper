2008-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	Busybyesk1		Hey there Ubuntu users.  I know this is probably a busy time, but I've got a wireless disconnect.  It worked in gutsy and not in hardy, any ideas or related problems?
2008-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- broadcom?
2008-04-29T05:56:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- no, it's your hardware.  there shoujld be a restricted devices manager up top?
2008-04-29T05:57:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	 with the icons for battery, network etc..?
2008-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- yes, and if its not there its under system- admin - hardware drivers
2008-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- hopefully its just you need a driver
2008-04-29T05:59:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	No proprietary drivers are in use on this system.  isn't that an oddity?
2008-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- that's actually a good thing, but the bad thing is if it doesn't suggest for you to, which may have been the problem
2008-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	it doesn't suggest any sort of driver.  on a notebook with touchpad working well, audio is terrible, and wireless down
2008-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	it can discover all available networks, just not connect and windows still can
2008-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- use lspci to figure out what you ahve
2008-04-29T06:02:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	it must be using the hardware to discover multiple wireless networks, right?
2008-04-29T06:03:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- yeah it's not a driver problem... have you tired moving closer to the router?
2008-04-29T06:04:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	vista connects with no difficulty at all, it's a well repeated network around a campus
2008-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	http://paste.ubuntu.com/8618/
2008-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	 looks like 3945ABG
2008-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- just for the record, is the LCD working
2008-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	no, it's orange, blue is "working"
2008-04-29T06:08:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- that's bug #178530, and no known solution as of now.  Are you able to access "open" networks?
2008-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	none are available to test with
2008-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- all i can say is either wait or subsribe to that bug report and try to help it get fixed, sorry
2008-04-29T06:12:00.000Z	Busybyesk1	RequinB4	thanks for the help
2008-04-29T06:12:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- due to the nature of the bug, i'm pretty sure it'll be fixed shortly, as they are alrady making progress
2008-04-29T06:12:00.000Z	RequinB4	Busybyesk1	- it's always a busy time right after a distro release
