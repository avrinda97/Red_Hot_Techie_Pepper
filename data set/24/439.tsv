2011-09-01T21:52:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	what do you want to do?? set a static IP?
2011-09-01T21:53:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	"sudo ifconfig eth0 inet <IP> netmask <mask> up"
2011-09-01T21:53:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	my internet connection randomly gets lost.  Ubuntu still says link is up, and the same cable/switch/router combination works in windows
2011-09-01T21:54:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	and when it doesnt work what does "ifconfig eth0" tell you
2011-09-01T21:54:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	everything looks normal in ifconfig
2011-09-01T21:55:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	so you have IP address etc, and your default route exists in "netstat -rn"
2011-09-01T21:56:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	hmm..  netstat has some odd output.  Let me paste it...
2011-09-01T21:56:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	oh.. can't paste it, cause I don't have internet :)
2011-09-01T21:56:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	wtv card is default in Compaq Elite 8200
2011-09-01T21:57:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	"lscpi |grep -i net"
2011-09-01T21:57:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	netstat doesn't have a gateway set for my local network.. but it does have the correct gateway for the network with destination "0.0.0.0
2011-09-01T21:57:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	Intel 8257SIFTU, oh.. can't paste it, cause I don't have interne9LM Gigabit Nic
2011-09-01T21:58:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	Intel 82579LM Gigabit NIC
2011-09-01T21:59:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	see above :)
2011-09-01T22:01:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	strange mask too
2011-09-01T22:01:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	the mask is correct, 255.255.254.0 is intentional
2011-09-01T22:02:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	ah ok
2011-09-01T22:02:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	and just to clarify this is static right, not dhcp
2011-09-01T22:02:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	correct
2011-09-01T22:04:00.000Z	SIFTU	josephwegner	/etc/network/interfaces looks something like this? (with your own IPS) http://pastebin.com/yg8iPgX6
2011-09-01T22:06:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	that file has two lines.. one says "auto lo"  the other says "iface lo inet loopback"
2011-09-01T22:08:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	eth0.. sorry
2011-09-01T22:08:00.000Z	josephwegner	SIFTU	type too fast for my own good
