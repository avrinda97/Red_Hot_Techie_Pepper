2006-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	john		Sklav, do I enable glx before or after i reconfigure xserver for nvidia?
2006-01-03T07:33:00.000Z	john		Sklav, how do i edit xorg.conf, can i open the file? if so how?
2006-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	Determinist	john	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-01-03T07:45:00.000Z	Determinist	john	i've set up my 6600GT and it works like a charm, what seems to be the problem? sorry, following with one eye here
2006-01-03T07:46:00.000Z	john	Determinist	get failed to start xserver blue screen
2006-01-03T07:46:00.000Z	Determinist	john	right, it happens sometimes. did you download the nvidia driver from their site and installed it or did you use the binary package that comes with ubuntu from the repository?
2006-01-03T07:48:00.000Z	Determinist	john	go with sklav's method, if that doesnt work gimme a holler, i'll show you how i did it. i dont want to interfere with their way in the middle
2006-01-03T07:49:00.000Z	john	Determinist	i used the one in repository
2006-01-03T07:49:00.000Z	Determinist	john	i've used the binary from nvidia... so sorry, go with sklav unless that doesnt work and i'll show you how it's done instead. btw, there's an excellent newbie how-to on ubuntuforums for this method.
2006-01-03T07:54:00.000Z	Determinist	john	i'm here :)
2006-01-03T07:54:00.000Z	john	Determinist	yey, please save me! ha ha
2006-01-03T07:55:00.000Z	john	Determinist	direct moi
2006-01-03T07:55:00.000Z	Determinist	john	alright, brb, i'll get you a link for a howto. i want you to follow this howto and ask me questions if something isnt clear about the instructions or if you cant complete them in any way. seems best to me.
2006-01-03T07:55:00.000Z	john	Determinist	k
2006-01-03T07:57:00.000Z	Determinist	john	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074 <--- you need method 2 which is specified in length after the summary of all 3 methods.
2006-01-03T07:58:00.000Z	john	Determinist	ok ill try it bud
2006-01-03T07:58:00.000Z	Determinist	john	i'll give you a link also to the nvidia site for the file you need to download (latest driver isnt the one you need).
2006-01-03T07:59:00.000Z	Determinist	john	this is the file to download from the nvidia site: http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-7667/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7667-pkg1.run
2006-01-03T08:02:00.000Z	Determinist	john	perhaps you have another session of synaptic running
2006-01-03T08:02:00.000Z	john	Determinist	nope, all closed
2006-01-03T08:03:00.000Z	Determinist	john	no idea there, try a reboot, perhaps it's some system fart because of the changes you've made... btw, the system might not boot into X if you do that :P
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	Determinist	john	np mate, good luck, give me a holler once you do and need help with the driver mate
2006-01-03T08:07:00.000Z	john	Determinist	you bet! he he
2006-01-03T08:10:00.000Z	Determinist	john	sudo dpkg -i <file>
