2007-05-02T08:34:00.000Z	nrdb		I am using the repos setup by synaptic and I have tried both the australian repos and the 'main' ones.
2007-05-02T08:36:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	what was the package thats having trouble again?
2007-05-02T08:37:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2007-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	when installing wine it also installs gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly which gives the error "files list file for package `gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly' contains empty filename"
2007-05-02T08:39:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	did you try "sudo apt-get install gstream0.10-plugins-ugly"
2007-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	yes a couple of times, I also deleted the apt cache file, to get it to download it again, it just doesn't want to work :(
2007-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	mind if I send it to you?
2007-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	nope, my email is nrdb01 at butterflystitches dot com dot au
2007-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	how did you do that, it appeared to start the transfer but stoped ???
2007-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	it finished, you have the file
2007-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	yes, the terminal was in the wrong directory thanks, how did you do that ?
2007-05-02T08:48:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	I right clicked on your name and selected "send file"
2007-05-02T08:49:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	it doesn't work, do you want the output of 'sudo dpkg --install ....' ?
2007-05-02T08:49:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	yes i do =)
2007-05-02T08:50:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	but if its too long, use pastebin
2007-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	try installing it with a --force-all flag
2007-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	no complaints from dpkg, but when I went to install wine again it said it was doing 1 upgrade and 1 install, and failed on the gstreamer again :(
2007-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	argh...  give me the full output at www.pastebin.com
2007-05-02T09:00:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/18813/
2007-05-02T09:02:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	i donno... worked for me, locale settings maybe?
2007-05-02T09:03:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	as this is quite a new install I might just reinstall fiesty, is there any way to get the install not to change the hdd rdb block ?
2007-05-02T09:03:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	that is not do the grub stuff
2007-05-02T09:04:00.000Z	DBO	nrdb	not that I know of, the alternative install CD might give you more options there though
2007-05-02T09:05:00.000Z	nrdb	DBO	ok, thanks for the help, I leaned a couple of things.
