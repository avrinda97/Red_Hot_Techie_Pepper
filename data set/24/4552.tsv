2011-07-28T23:35:00.000Z	GeorgeJ		Hello. I'm trying to attempt something pretty crazy. I've got a remote box with ubuntu server 10.04 and I want to install a fresh 11.04 on it. I've had some bad experiences with debootstrap previously. Is there any way I could boot from a live image, connect to it and start the instalation remotely? But without using a CD?
2011-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	not really, no
2011-07-28T23:38:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	Would you atleast recommend https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/OverSSH ?
2011-07-28T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	no, %100 not
2011-07-28T23:38:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	Sadly there is no other way of doing this. I have no problem getting my hands dirty, actually I'd love it.  Would you recommend something else though?
2011-07-28T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	no, %100 not
2012-01-04T17:58:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	Wrong. I gave him a sollution allready, he just didn't bother to read it.
2012-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	it's not wrong, that site is not setup to work with linux based browsers, he can try to fool it, but what's the point,
2012-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	That is irrelevant, firefox's rendered behaves no differently to my knowledge on linux than from windoes, or mac.
2012-01-04T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	I'm sure it does, I'm not disputing that
2012-01-04T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	I don't think so,
2012-01-04T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	possibly if you use xinerama, but that never used to work in gnome 2 so I have no reason to think it's been updated in gnome 3
2012-05-14T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	vi is a symlink to vim
2012-05-14T13:04:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	"vi improved = vim"
2012-05-14T13:04:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	the binary is called "vi" on most systems for legacy reasons
2012-05-14T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	it's not symlinked any more like it used to be
2012-05-14T13:05:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	It is on 12.04
2012-05-14T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	what is
2012-05-14T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	right, so there you go, /usr/bin/vim.tiny is the binary you are linked to
2012-05-14T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	ok, so the binary is vim.tiny
2012-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	what are you talking about,
2012-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	you have a vim build on your system, do you want to change it ?
2012-05-14T13:09:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	ikonia	Well, I now realised vi, on a fresh Ubuntu install is just a symlink to vim-tiny
2012-05-14T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	GeorgeJ	there is,
