2008-09-01T23:14:00.000Z	Chlorate		Prince_jammys: well our problem is that we have to type in a command in the terminal for our usb ports to mount.  But each time we reboot we have to type it out, and we want to automate it at boot. If that makes any sense
2008-09-01T23:14:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	try appending  &  to the end of any terminal command your wanting to run
2008-09-01T23:14:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	ah right, there is a gui in the system menu for this
2008-09-01T23:15:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	What does that mean? Sorry! I'm kinda new.
2008-09-01T23:15:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	system -> preferences -> sessions : startup programs : click add
2008-09-01T23:16:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	give your commnad a name and put the command you normally run manually in the command field
2008-09-01T23:16:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	I did that! And it didn't work. :\
2008-09-01T23:17:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	is the command a one liner?
2008-09-01T23:17:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	Yes.
2008-09-01T23:17:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	can you paste it here please
2008-09-01T23:17:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	sudo modprobe -r ehci_hcd
2008-09-01T23:17:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	well then prefix the command with gksudo
2008-09-01T23:18:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	like this : gksudo modprobe -r ehci_hcd
2008-09-01T23:18:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	 Okay. Should I now reboot and see if it works?
2008-09-01T23:19:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	sudo will only prompt you for password if your in the terminal, gksudo does more and makes sure things are setup for x to interact properly with priveldges
2008-09-01T23:19:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	you can also put a switch in there so sudo immeaditly forgets your 'sudo session' which normally timesout after 15minutes without any further activity
2008-09-01T23:20:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	Flannel: Well. I'm pretty newb. So what should my command be then if it's currently gksudo modprobe -r ehci_hcd
2008-09-01T23:26:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	iMatter: Yeah we're both stuck.
2008-09-01T23:22:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	if the gksu isnt being presented when your using that sessions interface to auto start your script, then you may have to look into using runlevels
2008-09-01T23:23:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	How does that work then?
2008-09-01T23:24:00.000Z	airtonix	Chlorate	or i think you can create a rc file in your home folder that will run commands in it when your desktop loads
2008-09-01T23:29:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	iMatter: What's that?
2008-09-01T23:34:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	Alright. I think I got it?
2008-09-01T23:40:00.000Z	Chlorate	airtonix	iMatter: This whole conversation has been a bit too advanced for my level of familiarity!
