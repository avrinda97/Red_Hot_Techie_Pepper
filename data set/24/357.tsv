2011-11-02T00:50:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	after you installed did you remove the usb drive before rebooting? if you dont it will boot the usb drive instead
2011-11-02T00:51:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	or did i misread?
2011-11-02T00:51:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	it will ask what you want to do
2011-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	you will get fussed at if you repeat yourself. I wont be able to tell you without a screen shot
2011-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	sasori	riffautae	1 sec..uploading a screenshot now
2011-11-02T00:59:00.000Z	sasori	riffautae	here it is http://i.imgur.com/26nOt.png what to do next ?
2011-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	the thing on the right is how much space for ubuntu, the thing on the left is how mouch it leaves for windows
2011-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	ubuntu will make all its partitions in that 86.2gb space area
2011-11-02T01:01:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	if you drag the line between the two areas it will let you adjust it
2011-11-02T01:01:00.000Z	sasori	riffautae	lol..awesome :D
2011-11-02T01:02:00.000Z	sasori	riffautae	what's the usual size of an ubuntu distro ?
2011-11-02T01:03:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	you can go as small as 20 prolly but that wont leave much for your own files
2011-11-02T01:03:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	you could figure ou what the minimum you need for windows fiels in the future will be and give the rest to ubuntu if you reallyt like linux :)
2011-11-02T01:04:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	nice
2011-11-02T01:38:00.000Z	riffautae	sasori	the screensaver should have options for that
