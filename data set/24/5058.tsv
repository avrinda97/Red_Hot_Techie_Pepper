2006-11-05T13:36:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		Hello!
2006-11-05T13:38:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		hey superkirby: did you try ati drivers?
2006-11-05T13:38:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		if I remember right, ATI is the maker for most Mac video cards
2006-11-05T13:40:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		usually the livecd will boot fine with ATI, but you can always try the "alternate install" cd from ubuntu.com.  It works on well on tricky video hardware
2006-11-05T13:41:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		it may, but it should work better
2006-11-05T13:41:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	and BHSPitLappy : what happens after install.. will i need to isntall my drivers like i did in fc5?
2006-11-05T13:42:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	what are you installing on?
2006-11-05T13:42:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		liquidsoul: have you tried the drivers from www.nvidia.com?
2006-11-05T13:43:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	my computer... 64bit desktop
2006-11-05T13:43:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	in fc5 i installed my nvidia drivers through yum.. from the livna repo.. is there an equivalent in ubuntu?
2006-11-05T13:43:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		mandman: what did you mean by "what happens after install"?  Could you elaborate, I'm not quite following...
2006-11-05T13:44:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	 yes, if you edit /etc/apt/sources.lst and remove the "#" from each line that starts with "#deb", you should be set.  An EXCELLENT resource for all of this is www.ubuntuguide.org
2006-11-05T13:45:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	.. well in fc5 .. i installed with text installer.. then my video still did not work ... so i had to install the drivers.. then start x
2006-11-05T13:45:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	thanks.. ill check it out
2006-11-05T13:45:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	no prob.  As for nvidia drivers, the way I do it is download them using lynx in text mode, and then run the text installer.  It can be complicated if you're not used to it
2006-11-05T13:46:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	im fairly comfortable with cli... so you go to nvidia.com or wherever and download them?
2006-11-05T13:46:00.000Z	LordDiabolus		restricted modules?  Haven't had much luck with those...
2006-11-05T13:47:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	okay, first do "sudo apt-get install lynx" to get a text browser installed, then run lynx, type "g" to go to a site, then type in www.nvidia.com, then navigate to drivers, linux, your platform, etc.  This will download the latest/greatest driver
2006-11-05T13:48:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	one last question... its an evga card... but nvidia chip... i still get nvidia drivers right?
2006-11-05T13:48:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	evga?  I'm not familiar with that, what model card/chipset is it?
2006-11-05T13:48:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	evga 7800gt .... its an nvidia card though
2006-11-05T13:49:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	evga 7800gt ... geforce 7800 chip
2006-11-05T13:49:00.000Z	LordDiabolus	madman91	7800?  Yes, the newest nvidia drivers cover those, it's the chipset that the driver controls, you should be good with it
2006-11-05T13:49:00.000Z	madman91	LordDiabolus	thanks
