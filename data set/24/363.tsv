2012-04-22T14:13:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		how do you get a script to run at login? usually I use .xinitrc, but that only runs when I select User Defined Session from the Login Manager
2012-04-22T14:13:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		I want a script to run a login regardless of what type of X Session I select
2012-04-22T14:13:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		at login*
2012-04-22T14:14:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		ah ok, thanks
2012-04-22T14:16:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		and then not doing anything
2012-04-22T14:17:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		go into Downloads obviously
2012-04-22T14:17:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		and run it from there with    ./<filename here>
2012-04-22T14:17:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		$chmod +x <filename> makes it executable (if it isn't already)
2012-04-22T14:18:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	maybe you need upstart?
2012-04-22T14:18:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	maybe I do?
2012-04-22T14:18:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	http://upstart.ubuntu.com
2012-04-22T14:20:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	yeah that sounds like what I want
2012-04-22T14:21:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	after installation of what?
2012-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	of ubuntu
2012-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	I want to be able to run this after the installation of ubuntu https://github.com/thedrow/devenv-python/blob/master/bootstrap.sh
2012-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	I'm wondering if kickstart can do so in it's post event
2012-04-22T14:28:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	oh right
2012-04-22T14:29:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	I'm writing a series of blog posts about selecting and installing an OS development workstation for python
2012-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	I know I can run my command after using %post but I'm actually not sure in what state the OS is. Can it run everything as usual? If I login and run my script from the shell will the results be the same?
2012-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	I have no experience doing what you're doing..
2012-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	there is not much documentation of real world use cases regarding automated installation.
2012-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	I'm a developer, not an IT expert.
2012-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	the_drow	SwashBuckla	btw, http://omerkatz.com
2012-04-22T14:35:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	the_drow	oh cool. That might come in handy :)
