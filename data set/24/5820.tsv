2006-08-08T15:56:00.000Z	HeXiOn		Hello
2006-08-08T15:56:00.000Z	HeXiOn		need help
2006-08-08T15:56:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Just tell us your problem :)
2006-08-08T15:58:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	You can completely disable the monitor's suspend settings by removing the "option      "DPMS"" line from the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-08-08T15:59:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	going to my xorg.conf... ;)
2006-08-08T15:59:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	To edit that file, open a terminal and run "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2006-08-08T15:59:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	(it's under the Device section for your monitor)
2006-08-08T16:00:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	do u thinks it's for xgl or it's ubuntu at all?
2006-08-08T16:01:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	It may be gnome-screensaver. It is pretty new, so those movie players which do support disabling screensaver stuff only support xscreensaver at the moment
2006-08-09T16:01:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	ok, changed line so it's now [Option      "DPMS" "false"] 
2006-08-09T16:01:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	thank you very much :)
2006-08-09T16:03:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	one last issue.. to make changes at xorg.conf work, I have to restart X or the machine?
2006-08-09T16:04:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Just X (either ctrl-alt-backspace or sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart <- do that from a console, since the process will die in X before it can ressurect itself)
2006-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Use "mplayer" from command line (actually, that is what mplayer does by default. "gmplayer" is a GUI)
2006-08-09T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Of course :)
2006-08-09T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	You can put "Open With" (in right click>properties) to open with a custom command "mplayer" [the default MPlayer Movie Player entry uses gmplayer)
2006-08-09T06:00:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	thank you! it worked again! :)
2006-08-09T06:47:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	my problem with the screen is still there :( I removed the line [Option "DPMS"]  and it still gets off :(
2006-08-09T06:49:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Wow, you just caught me as I was changing desktops. Other than ending the gnome-screensaver option I don't know
2006-08-09T07:10:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	 I've searched in the Power Management Preference's help and I see I haven't an option the help pictures have: "Put display to sleep when computer is inactive for: X minutes"  I think it's my problem. What can I do to enable that option??? dpkg-reconfigure gnome-power-management ????
2006-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	Have you tried help.ubuntu.com/community?
2006-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	yes, I've searched the whole net :( wikys.. support... forums...
2006-08-09T07:12:00.000Z	Warbo	HeXiOn	I wouldn't know what to suggest then sorry :(
2006-08-09T07:12:00.000Z	HeXiOn	Warbo	ok, thanks for your help :)
