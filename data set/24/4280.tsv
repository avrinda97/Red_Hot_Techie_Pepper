2009-02-12T05:45:00.000Z	sileni		hey guys im having trouble installing spim in my ubuntu intrepid. My teacher said i could just do sudo apt-get install spim and it would work. But it is not working. I did research and its supposed to be in multiverse. I checked my sources.list and the multiverse repositories are uncommented. Any ideas on what i might be missing?
2009-02-12T05:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Have you manually edited the sources.list and uncommented those?
2009-02-12T05:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Hmmm...methinks that that would be a good thing.
2009-02-12T05:46:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	hmm ok i go try it now
2009-02-12T05:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	And bring me back a cheeseburger! :)
2009-02-12T05:49:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	i uncommented the multiverse-restricted entries, and it still cannot find spim
2009-02-12T05:50:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Did you do an "apt-get update" -> ??
2009-02-12T05:50:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	im currently looking at this. http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/electronics/spim if the package is available for dapper it should be available for intrepid
2009-02-12T05:50:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	yes i did sudo aptitude update
2009-02-12T05:50:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Yes...SHOULD...
2009-02-12T05:51:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Matter of fact, if you already know where the .deb files are for SPIM, you should be able to just d/l them and install them manually if all else fails...
2009-02-12T05:51:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	yes but it irks me , not being able to get this with apt-get
2009-02-12T05:51:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	what am i doing wrong
2009-02-12T05:51:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	let me cat my sources.list , and can you please take a look?
2009-02-12T05:52:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	I'd tend to reckon that the person responsible for packaging it did not upgrade themselves...
2009-02-12T05:52:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	You'll have to pastebin it mate.

2009-02-12T05:54:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	Looks good - did you do the "apt-get update" or whatever, to reload the database?
2009-02-12T05:54:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	yes, i did
2009-02-12T05:55:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	I just checked the forums...

2009-02-12T05:55:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	It appears as though the package was removed on purpose, though you can still get the packages and manually install them...
2009-02-12T05:56:00.000Z	sileni	YankDownUnder	thank you so much i appreciate you taking your time to help me
2009-02-12T05:56:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	sileni	No a worry mate.
