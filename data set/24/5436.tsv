2006-07-15T13:49:00.000Z	nasty_b		Hey guys. I'm a complete newb when it comes to linux. I have ubuntu 6.06 desktop-amd62 installed (because I dont know linux at all). I noticed that there is a "add/remove software" (and also another one for more complex installations), which is great if what I'm looking for is in the list. However what I want to install is not on the list. I download the .tar file, and I then extract it, but I don't know what to do from there. Can any
2006-07-15T13:51:00.000Z	nasty_b		Admin: yeah thats the one for the more complex installations, right?
2006-07-15T13:52:00.000Z	nasty_b		I know how to open it, though, if thats what you're asking.
2006-07-15T13:53:00.000Z	nasty_b		MythTV. I downloaded it (to desktop by default), and then I extracted it (the folder is on the desktop). And I don't know where to go from there.
2006-07-15T13:54:00.000Z	nasty_b		all the contents of the tar file
2006-07-15T13:54:00.000Z	nasty_b		the whole software
2006-07-15T13:51:00.000Z	nasty_b		Hey guys I just installed MySQL-server and MySQL-client through Synaptic. It says everything has been installed. Now I'm wondering how to make sure it's been installed, and how to configure everything. Also, I'm wondering how to locate the client so I can start using it.
2006-07-15T13:52:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	the client can be accessed by 'mysql' username is root, password is blank
2006-07-15T13:53:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	I'm not sure exactly what you mean. I'm using desktop version...
2006-07-15T13:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	open a terminal, you can use the baisc client from there
2006-07-15T13:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	you might also want to check out phpmyadmin for a web interface
2006-07-15T13:55:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	I open up the terminal server client but I'm still unsure of what you mean.... sorry, but I really don't know much of what I'm doing
2006-07-15T13:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	just to be surew - you're trying to run mysql commands?
2006-07-15T13:56:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	Well I'd like to first create users for the database. I'm not sure if that would fall under that category?
2006-07-15T13:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	it would. Would you like a command line interface, or a web interface?
2006-07-15T13:58:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	I wont be needing to run any commands from any other computer so I don't feel the need to install phpmyadmin. I just need to do a few things from this machine (the one mysql is installed on) so I think command line would be ok
2006-07-15T13:58:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	okay then, first open a terminal (should be under the application menu)
2006-07-15T13:58:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	yeah I have that open
2006-07-15T13:59:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	type 'mysql -u root -p ""'
2006-07-15T14:00:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	ok
2006-07-15T14:02:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	ok thanks a lot. I "Terminal server client" open instead of "terminal". Thanks again!
2006-07-15T14:02:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	tsc is for connecting to windows systems I think
2006-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	nasty_b	bbrazil	yeah VNC and stuff
2006-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	nasty_b	something like that
