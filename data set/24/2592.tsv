2008-11-19T03:34:00.000Z	MaT-dg		how do I install the new flash player 10 for 64bit? (downloaded .so file from adobe.com)
2008-11-19T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	it's crashy.  Do you really want to?
2008-11-19T03:35:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	yes, want to try. 32-bit version is also bugged anyway
2008-11-19T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	purge the flashplugin-nonfree package and copy libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2008-11-19T03:40:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	okay that worked thx! (had to create the plugins-folder tough), can I purge de nspluginwrapper to?
2008-11-19T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	if you want to
2008-11-19T03:43:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	hmm seems that ubuntu-restricted-extras recommends it.. I think it might be better to not remove it..
2008-11-19T03:43:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	no problem either way
2009-06-30T17:30:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	DASPRiD: I tried the firefox-3.5 package, you can install it next to firefox 3.0 and even run them both at the same time. Bookmarks and plugins are in both. The problem is that it's the beta4 so it's still very bugged. For example: back and forward buttons are greyed out
2009-07-22T22:13:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	why do you want to know this?
2009-07-22T22:14:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	I use the program aegisub and when my audioprovider is set to openal, there's no sound
2010-05-01T17:49:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	I have reproduced my error here -> http://pastebin.com/apVmT5Zb
2010-05-01T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	I believe you need to install libavcodec-unstripped
2010-05-01T17:54:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	Did that, same errors
2010-05-01T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	a reasonable guess would be to also try libavcodec-extra
2010-05-01T17:57:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	that one is already installed, I believe it came with ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-05-01T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	that should work afaik.  Try to verify or disprove that.  That's what I would do before trying to do something more drastic like rebuilding ffmpeg myself
2010-05-01T18:15:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	No luck -> http://pastebin.com/22jAdKUv. I've read things about that codec being removed due to licensing issues. I think the older version of ffmpeg is my only option
2010-05-01T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	the older version of ffmpeg has the same problem.  It only works with unstripped libavcodec
2010-05-01T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	I don't know the specific.  If you don't really care why, just rebuild ffmpeg and read the debian/rules carefully.  There are usually some nice commented sections that will enable most of the stuff if you uncomment it.  Or at least that's how it looked a few releases ago
2010-05-01T19:21:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	just to let u know: solved the ffmpeg problem by installing ffmpeg and libavcodec from medibuntu repo's
2010-05-01T20:39:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	hmm, I checked medibuntu but they don't seem to provide ffmpeg for lucid
2010-05-01T20:40:00.000Z	MaT-dg	jrib	libavcodec alone then... thing is.. I have me encoder now :)
2010-05-01T20:41:00.000Z	jrib	MaT-dg	cool
