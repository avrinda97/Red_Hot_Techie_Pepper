2006-07-18T13:06:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	but the 32bit version can't support 64bit wifi cards sometimes?
2006-07-18T13:06:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	64bit wifi cards? are they bit specific?
2006-07-18T13:07:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	don't they use a completely different protocol, independent of the cpu?
2006-07-18T13:07:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	yes
2006-07-18T13:07:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	but it seems if you have a 64bit system you need to use the 64bit version of the driver for the wifi card
2006-07-18T13:07:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	there *are* different 32bit/64bit versions, i don't know why
2006-07-18T13:08:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	oh yes, the driver needs to match of course
2006-07-18T13:08:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	but if you're 32bit distro is on a 64bit machine, it's hard to get the wireless drivers to work -- if it's a 64bit distro on a 64bit machine, you use the 64bit driver and it works fine
2006-07-18T13:08:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	damn english, s/you're/your
2006-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	oh. I thought 64bit linux is not mature enough for me yet. but if it can do wifi in 32bit mode it's a different story.
2006-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	i don't think it can
2006-07-18T13:09:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	if it cannot I meant of course
2006-07-18T13:10:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	yeah, 64bit linux is still lacking
2006-07-18T13:10:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	yeah.
2006-07-18T13:10:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	I say a year or so probably and will improve
2006-07-18T13:11:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	yeap, if i had 64bit hardware i'd run a 32bit OS
2006-07-31T11:32:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	up:12kb/sec down:80-250kb/sec (kilobytes/sec)
2006-07-31T11:32:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	dslreports.com might have more information
2006-07-31T11:34:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	I get 600kb/sec up and 1.5megs/sec down for like 45/50 a month, (Verizon FiOS)
2006-07-31T11:36:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	that sounds like a good deal. prices are generally higher in Europe or the connections are slower
2006-08-10T15:49:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	don't repeat
2006-08-10T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	Spec	:)
2006-08-10T15:50:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	and spell don't correctly =P
2006-08-10T15:51:00.000Z	Spec	mwe	azureal: damnit, i said please don't repeat. thanks.
