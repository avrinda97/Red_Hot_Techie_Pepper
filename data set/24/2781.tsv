2009-03-23T03:02:00.000Z	Ariana		should i just assume that the stuff i type, noone sees?
2009-03-23T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	i can see it
2009-03-23T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	i just came in so havent seen your query
2009-03-23T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	part of the partitioning is to set what each is used for and if it is to be formatted or not
2009-03-23T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	run through the installed and tell it which partitions are used for each mount point (/ and /swp)
2009-03-23T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	they will need formatting ext2 or ext3
2009-03-23T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	does the other disk show up in sudo fdisk -l ?
2009-03-23T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	not sure, i dont use windows at all
2009-03-23T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	sudo fdisk -l  will list your partitions in the system that the kernel can see
2009-03-23T03:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	read htose guides for installing to usb
2009-03-23T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	could use a vm maybe
2009-03-23T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	to boot the iso and then install to usb that way
2009-03-23T03:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	i dont use windows so i dont know
2009-03-23T03:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	it adds stuff to the windows bootup, what is so precious of your boot sector if yu only boot windows
2009-03-23T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	the windows OS can only read and write to NTFS unless you install fs-driver, which is why its not showing the space as an option
2009-03-23T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	it'd save you a tonne of issues
2009-03-23T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	you can install fs-driver from www.fs-driver.org
2009-03-23T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	and your ext3 formatted partions will be available to windows
2009-03-23T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	it will on the USB as thats where itts being installed to
2009-03-23T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	if you are only boting P i really dont understand why you are worried about the bot sector. It can be easily repaired with you Pcd with a simple fixmbr then fixbot   job done
2009-03-23T03:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	sure youjust wont be able to read the journal
2009-03-23T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	i think you are making this way too complicated
2009-03-23T03:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	grub is fine, i wouldnt worry about looks, its on the screen for a few seconds
2009-03-23T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Ariana	i'd go by functionality  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_boot_loaders
