2007-01-11T09:26:00.000Z	ikonia		 don't use automatix - it sucks
2007-01-11T09:26:00.000Z	ikonia		its that simple
2007-01-11T09:26:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	too late now...
2007-01-11T09:31:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	how do you not have web access and you are on irc?
2007-01-11T09:31:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	web access = web pages - I am connected to the itnernet
2007-01-11T09:31:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	i see
2007-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	give us more detail
2007-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	I think you have the answer there
2007-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	well yea, but i cant get it to work even after unpacking it
2007-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	you can't install it unpacked
2007-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	the file is the "wrong format"
2007-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	i tried it while it was packed
2007-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	but its "the wrong format"
2007-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	well, i understand the error, but i dont know why, i googled it and it told me a work around.. but it still isnt installing...
2007-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	report it to the person who packaged it
2007-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	nothing... thanks
2007-01-11T09:36:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	he's not blaming it - he's using it to highlight what your up to
2007-01-11T09:37:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	reinstall
2007-01-11T09:38:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	re-install ubuntu
2007-01-11T09:39:00.000Z	madcheez2	ikonia	no. not until i prove its broken..
2007-01-11T09:39:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	we can't support a system that is using  automatix
2007-01-11T09:40:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	me presonally yes - the channel - probably too
2007-01-11T09:41:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	its pretty fair to say so
2007-01-11T09:42:00.000Z	ikonia	madcheez2	automatrix can break the ubuntu install in subtle ways - how do we know waht it has or hasn't done
