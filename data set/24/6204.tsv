2008-05-07T10:09:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	hmm, when you hit alt-ctrl-F2 you end up to commandline, where you can log in and check if X logs have anything interesting, right?
2008-05-07T10:09:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	grew impatient; rebooted via button
2008-05-07T10:10:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	heh, it could be just overactive screensaver for example, or, buggy driver, or, whatever
2008-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	looks like black screen upon booting also - ctl-alt-f2 gets me to a text mode login prompt - am looking at xorg log now
2008-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	great, sounds like just driver issue or so
2008-05-07T10:13:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	can't tell from the log what broke
2008-05-07T10:14:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	"grep EE /vat/log/Xorg.0.log" returns what ? pastebin :)

2008-05-07T10:21:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	btw, lspci says "01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RS690 [Radeon X1200 Series]"
2008-05-07T10:23:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	ah, interesting
2008-05-07T10:23:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	do i have a path forward or is ubuntu just not the distro for this box?
2008-05-07T10:24:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	well, whatever the problem is, it's not because of Ubuntu, but I don't know much about ati myself so, hard to say
2008-05-07T10:24:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	can you try "vesa" driver ?
2008-05-07T10:25:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	i have no idea - install never gave me a choice
2008-05-07T10:26:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	you don't need to install vesa driver, it's somewhat "failsafe standard" driver
2008-05-07T10:28:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	my xorg.conf looks so generic that it hardly seems usable - doesn't specify *any* driver
2008-05-07T10:32:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	heh, so prolly we should add one, hmmm
2008-05-07T10:32:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	well, what happened to this whole installation process that handled that?
2008-05-07T10:34:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	we now rely on "automagic" which works well in great majority of cases
2008-05-07T10:34:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	new Xorg which does things just tad bit better
2008-05-07T10:37:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	ok, Xorg -configure gave me nothing useful
2008-05-07T10:39:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	so how is this "automagic" invoked?
2008-05-07T10:42:00.000Z	Tm_T	JeffATL	sorry, but I don't know
2008-05-07T10:43:00.000Z	JeffATL	Tm_T	am noting http://www.beijinglug.org/en/index.php?option=com_fireboard&Itemid=66&func=view&id=2334&catid=3
