2005-01-11T17:38:00.000Z	drspin	GoneBoB	yes -- unfortunately it lacks the necessary patch (which I can't compile because I can't install gnome-devel) that would allow my joystick to function
2005-01-11T17:38:00.000Z	GoneBoB	drspin	aha

2005-01-31T14:56:00.000Z	drspin	GoneBoB	would I need to reinstall my nvidia drivers?
2005-01-31T14:56:00.000Z	drspin	GoneBoB	for the performance gain would it be worth it?
2005-01-31T14:59:00.000Z	GoneBoB	drspin	well considering you've probably taken more time thinking about it than it would to install :)
2005-01-31T14:59:00.000Z	GoneBoB	drspin	it also features a few things like >800mb ram support

2005-01-31T15:05:00.000Z	drspin	GoneBoB	I'm pretty sure that's on in the Bios...
2005-01-31T15:59:00.000Z	GoneBoB	drspin	no, ubuntu uses udev
2005-01-31T16:51:00.000Z	drspin	GoneBoB	not all cameras... mine doesn't
2005-01-31T16:52:00.000Z	GoneBoB	drspin	what a pain
