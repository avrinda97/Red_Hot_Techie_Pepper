2007-07-29T09:26:00.000Z	westguy		but without root password I cannot install java, I am new to linux
2007-07-29T09:27:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	You being new doesn't stop you from reading the page ubotu linked you to.
2007-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Please read the page.
2007-07-29T10:08:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Okay, here's the jist. When you want to run something as root, you put "sudo" before the command.
2007-07-29T10:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	if what you are running is a graphical application, you use "gksudo"
2007-07-29T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Run this: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
2007-07-29T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Enter YOUR password when prompted.
2007-07-29T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Into terminal, yes.
2007-07-29T10:11:00.000Z	westguy	Stormx2	: use my account password write?
2007-07-29T10:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Right.
2007-07-29T10:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Yeah, I'll explain it. "sudo" gives you root, as we've discussed. "apt-get" is a package managing application - it managers what is installed on your computer. "install" is what you're telling apt-get to do. "sun-java6-jre" is the package you're installing.
2007-07-29T10:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	pastebin it.
2007-07-29T10:17:00.000Z	westguy	Stormx2	after installing do I need to save it?
2007-07-29T10:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Save what?
2007-07-29T10:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	Uh, I don't follow. The package is fully installed. What exactly are you intending to "save"?
2007-07-29T10:21:00.000Z	westguy	Stormx2	the sun java is working fine , thanks zillion
2007-07-29T10:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	westguy	You're talking to a bot.
