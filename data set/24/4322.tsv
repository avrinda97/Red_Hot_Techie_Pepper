2007-05-14T09:40:00.000Z	Pelo	anathematic	 assuming you can't just restore it from the trash,  try reinstlling samba from synaptic
2007-05-14T09:40:00.000Z	anathematic	Pelo	what do you mean from synaptic?
2007-05-14T09:42:00.000Z	Pelo	anathematic	synaptic package manager , it a gui front end for apt,  you can easily reisntal packages in it , it's a right click option,  should restore anything you deleted that is needed
2007-05-14T09:42:00.000Z	anathematic	Pelo	i'm in console so i can't really do any gui stuff at the moment it's all in console :<

2007-05-14T09:44:00.000Z	Pelo	anathematic	 sudo apt-get check packagename
2007-05-14T09:45:00.000Z	anathematic	Pelo	 worked fine but i still can't install the package correctly
