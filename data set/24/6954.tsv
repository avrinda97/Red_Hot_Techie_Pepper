2005-06-04T14:02:00.000Z	jeff25		so when the new ubuntu comes out
2005-06-04T14:02:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	october
2005-06-04T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	what do you mean with ubuntu porting?
2005-06-04T15:29:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	well I want to create a .deb for the lastest version of fluxbox
2005-06-04T15:29:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	try the MOTU: wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU wiki.ubuntu.com/UniverseCandidates #ubuntu-motu
2005-06-04T15:30:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	ok thanks
2005-06-07T13:37:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	backport sucks, backports-stagings sucks harder :)
2005-06-07T13:37:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	well I need smbfs and it's on backports
2005-06-07T13:38:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	it's in the normal repositories too!
2005-06-07T13:41:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	you're right.  Thanks
2005-06-07T13:44:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	is there anyway to get a list of all packages from backports using dpkg?
2005-06-07T14:00:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	why do you think backports suck?
2005-06-07T14:00:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	because the tend to cause breakage
2005-06-07T14:00:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	and why does that happen ?
2005-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	because the people who buikd the backports are not good enough at packagebuilding...
2005-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	ah
2005-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	what is a 'backport' anyway
2005-06-07T14:02:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	a backport is a newer version of some package adapted to work in an older version of a distribution
2005-06-07T14:02:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	ah
2005-06-07T14:04:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	so what's the solution? Run old stuff ?
2005-06-07T14:04:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	with a 6-month release schedule, there is no old stuff...
2005-06-07T14:05:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	I agree with you though... backports packing people make some mistakes... for example the fluxbox 0.9.13 is broken.  I had to compile my own version and make a .deb for it.  They didn't compile it with the right configure switches
2005-06-07T14:07:00.000Z	jeff25	Seveas	since I'm an ex gentoo user, 6 months is a long time to wait.  I'm sure I'll be compiling stuff like fluxbox the day it hits the CVS server
2005-06-07T14:07:00.000Z	Seveas	jeff25	ah :)
