2011-05-11T11:57:00.000Z	suniil		I want to download ubuntu repository for ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS 64bit for offline use. Can anyone guide me on this
2011-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	like a local repository for lan use?
2011-05-11T11:59:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	yes, you are right
2011-05-11T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	http://www.howtoforge.com/local_debian_ubuntu_mirror
2011-05-11T12:02:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	I am check the link provided by you, just a minute
2011-05-11T12:03:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	will this mirror the package specific to my release or it will mirror all the contents
2011-05-11T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	every and all
2011-05-11T12:03:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	I want specific to my release.
2011-05-11T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	sorry it will be only the release you are on as far as I am aware
2011-05-11T12:06:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	I am not sure, I dont know why I feel that this will mirror everything not just .deb specific to my release.
2011-05-11T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	because its a local repo like the ones you install from so you will get all packagea
2011-05-11T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	if you only want debs for the packages you have installed you can
2011-05-11T12:10:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	how, I just want all the packets specific to my release only.
2011-05-11T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	you can tell apt-get to only download the debs. So if you use the !clone factoid commands to get the list of installed package names in a text file you can then tell apt-get to download the debs
2011-05-11T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	is that what you mean?
2011-05-11T12:13:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	I know there is download only option is available, but in that case I have to specify all the package names.
2011-05-11T12:13:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	I want to download all the package specific to my release, all, without being specified.
2011-05-11T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	then look into apt-mirror. There may be some options to tell it to only pull natty debs down (or whatever you use)
2011-05-11T12:16:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	yes I am searching the man page
2011-05-11T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	its great for loads of systems on LAN as web updating 100 systems is silly but a local server pulling stuff down then the systems using that is great. Think WSUS ;-)
2011-05-11T12:21:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	did you understand, what is my requirement?
2011-05-11T12:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	as far as I can tell, the debs for the installed OS of a local repo.
2011-05-11T12:24:00.000Z	suniil	ActionParsnip	because a lot of bandwidth is consumed during updating new systems. I want to dowload all the debs  once on my server and share to all the systems on my lan.
2011-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	suniil	then you can use the download only option of apt-get then use aptoncd to distribute. Or setup a local repo on one system then tell the other systems to only use it for updates. This gives one download from the web which goes to many systems
