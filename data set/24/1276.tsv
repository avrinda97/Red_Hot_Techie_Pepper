2010-04-10T06:18:00.000Z	KingFish		Question: When I format my USB thumb drive in Ubuntu (fat32) and copy mp3's onto it, it won't play on my car deck but when I do the same in Windows, it works.  Does anyone know the specific version of fat windows uses because it seems that there are more than one to choose from in the disk utility.
2010-04-10T06:18:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	you need to figure out what formats the car player will accept
2010-04-10T06:21:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	good luck...it's a VW.  The standard format in Windows works so that should be fine
2010-04-10T06:22:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	I'm just not sure what format that is
2010-04-10T06:24:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	perhaps it will play wmv and not mp3 then?
2010-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	It works if I do the exact same thing in Windows.  I've played countless mp3's on it before from my windows box, it just doens't seem to work in Ubuntu.
2010-04-10T06:52:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	so a mp3 from windows will play in the car but not from linux?
2010-04-10T06:54:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	The deck in my car allows me to plug a usb flash drive right into the front of it.  I use my USB flash drives for everything including running live systems of 10.04 so I can check for problems and such.  Anyhow, when I reformat it to fat in Ubuntu and copy mp3's onto it, it won't read in my car.  If I do the same in Windows, it works fine.
2010-04-10T06:55:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	Now here is the problem.  There are several fat32 filesystems that you can choose from in the disk utility.  I'm wondering if anyone knows which one windows uses.
2010-04-10T06:55:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	try to select the lowest possible file system for the usb drive
2010-04-10T06:56:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	lowest?  I don't get what you mean.
2010-04-10T06:58:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	when you plug a USB flash drive in it automounts and an icon appears on the desktop.  If I right click on that and click format, the choice there is "compatable with all systems (fat)"
2010-04-10T06:59:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	try this
2010-04-10T06:59:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	if I choose to do that in the disk utility, I have a lot more choices: By default when you click on fat it chooses W95 FAT32 (LBA) (OxOc)
2010-04-10T07:00:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	trying...
2010-04-10T07:02:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	I'm going out to my car...stay tuned
2010-04-10T07:05:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	no dice.  Do you have a windows box there?
2010-04-10T07:06:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	no sorry I do not
2010-04-10T07:14:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	when the usb key is in you linux box try
2010-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	it's labeled vfat
2010-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	I have a bloody VW and this is the stock deck so I'm sure something fishy is there
2010-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	codec on the files themselves?
2010-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	KingFish	Barnabas	nah...it's a filesystem thing.  I've tried the same files in windows and they work fine.  It's just an mp3
2010-04-10T07:19:00.000Z	Barnabas	KingFish	out of ideas then
