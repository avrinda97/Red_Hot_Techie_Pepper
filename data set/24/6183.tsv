2006-01-14T13:11:00.000Z	Linuturk		if my card can handle half life 2 on windows, shouldn't it handle the fireworkx screensaver fine?
2006-01-14T13:12:00.000Z	Linuturk		well, good. I got worried there for a minute
2006-01-14T13:13:00.000Z	Linuturk		linux uses open gl
2006-01-14T13:13:00.000Z	Linuturk		windows uses directx
2006-01-14T13:15:00.000Z	Linuturk		so, directx > open gl
2006-01-14T13:16:00.000Z	Linuturk		will directx always be windows only?
2006-01-14T13:18:00.000Z	Linuturk		i sorta loathe kde, anything that'll run in gnome?
2006-01-14T10:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		question: I've got a folder i pulled over from my ntfs drive, and it's all read only. What's the easiest way to set these permissions for Owner Write?
2006-01-14T10:45:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	'chmod -R o+w folder/'
2006-01-14T10:48:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	did you do this as root or as a regular user?
2006-01-14T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	and you didn't use sudo?
2006-01-14T10:49:00.000Z	Linuturk	soundray	no sudo
2006-01-14T10:51:00.000Z	Linuturk	soundray	I ran this in the terminal from my Home directory "chmod -R o+w FAIA/" and the permissions didn't change. FAIA being the folder in my Home directory where all the subfiles and folders are
2006-01-14T10:51:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	then it won't cause much of a problem. You will only have modified files that were owned by the user. User-owned files that are write-protected are quite rare.
2006-01-14T10:53:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	sorry, my mistake
2006-01-14T10:53:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	chmod -R u+w FAIA/
2006-01-14T10:54:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	revert the damage from my mistake by doing 'chmod -R o-w FAIA/'
2006-01-14T10:54:00.000Z	soundray	Linuturk	u=user, o=others
2006-01-14T10:54:00.000Z	Linuturk	soundray	that did it.thanks buddie

2006-11-28T09:32:00.000Z	Linuturk	soundray	will that work with edgy?
