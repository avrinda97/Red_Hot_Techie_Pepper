2009-12-31T13:57:00.000Z	vduck	bgjsl	nope. It's essentially esata port on one machine to esata port on another. Not exactly, but pretty close
2009-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	bgjsl	vduck	check this

2009-12-31T14:06:00.000Z	vduck	bgjsl	I found similar info at http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/message.php?config=tomshardwareus.inc&cat=42&post=22305&page=1&p=1&subcat=238&sondage=0&owntopic=0&new=0 - it is theoretically possible to do, but some one would have to write code
2009-12-31T14:06:00.000Z	vduck	bgjsl	anyway, thanks
