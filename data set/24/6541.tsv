2007-09-10T06:29:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	no GUI, server box
2007-09-10T06:29:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Do you think it is one file or multiple?
2007-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	no clue
2007-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	that gave me the output of everything i suppose.  the output was '775G .'
2007-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Do 'du * -h' starting at '/
2007-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	And work your way down through offending directories
2007-09-10T06:32:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	ok, see you next week, lol
2007-09-10T06:33:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Oops, sorry, that doesn't do what I remember it does
2007-09-10T06:34:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	You can try 'durep' (never used it)
2007-09-10T06:34:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	i need to install that via apt, but i cant because my drive is full :S
2007-09-10T06:39:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Well you can do `du / -s | sort -n` (or maybe start with likely offenders like /var) or you can assume that one (or only a few files are the culprit) and try to use `find` to list files that are over, say 5 Gigs.
2007-09-10T06:40:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	You checked your logs right?
2007-09-10T06:40:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	well, i figured it out 'du * -h | grep G > log'  that way anything with a capital G (for GB) will write to the log
2007-09-10T06:42:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	I think that is recursive, and will show you only individual files over a Gigabyte. Better to use `find' if that is what you want to do.
2007-09-10T06:43:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	kitche:  the problem was that i had a copy of my music folder (mounted from another drive) on my main drive
2007-09-10T06:43:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Huh? How did your disk fill?
2007-09-10T06:44:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	i use rsync to back up all of my movies, music, etc every night.  i accidentally had the backup copy going to my local drive instead of my network mounted one
2007-09-10T06:45:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	You've got some serious storage going. I'm jealous.
2007-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	you have no idea :)
2007-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	TBs among TBs
2007-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	soothsayer	SpudDogg	Do you mount them in generic PCs or do you have NAS?
2007-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	no, they're physically in boxes, here and at a friends house
2007-09-10T06:49:00.000Z	SpudDogg	soothsayer	so i guess in generic PCs.  we have boxes that can hold 12 HDs, etc
