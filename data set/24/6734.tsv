2005-08-03T13:42:00.000Z	Slipjack		Anyone have a list of commands for IRC? I seem to have forgotten them all. Such as /nick
2005-08-03T13:42:00.000Z	Slipjack		I'll be a son of a.... thanks
2005-08-03T13:44:00.000Z	Slipjack		Ah that's right.
2005-08-03T13:45:00.000Z	Slipjack		I feel bad. I haven't used IRC since 1997. I haven't used Linux for over a year since yesterday (a lot of good that Linux+ certification did me).
2005-08-03T13:46:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	welcome back
2005-08-03T13:46:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	Thanks! Hah. Sorry I sold out to Microsoft. I swear I don't have Windows installed this time.
2005-08-03T13:47:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	thats not a problem, some times you NEED windows
2005-08-03T13:47:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	Gaming...
2005-08-03T13:52:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	the most amusing thing, i think, is people hating microsoft because they have alot of money and market share
2005-08-03T13:53:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	That bothers me to an extent. More of what they did to make that money, than that they actually have it.
2005-08-03T14:07:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	clicks and pops are the best
2005-08-03T14:07:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	And static!
2005-08-03T14:16:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	i take offense to that
2005-08-03T14:16:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	Sorry if you're gay. Or sorry if you're a mirc user. Not sure how to respond to that.
2005-08-03T14:17:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	i am not-hetero, do not dare compare me to an mirc user
2005-08-03T14:18:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	sounds good
2005-08-03T14:20:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	pansexual means you are not bisexual, or homosexual, you simply are attracted to people, gender aside
2005-08-03T14:20:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	its also been described as "f
2005-08-03T14:20:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	its also been described as "f**k anything that walks*
2005-08-03T14:21:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	I thought that was bisexual.
2005-08-03T14:21:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	Unless of course a hermaphrodite is neither male nor female.
2005-08-03T14:21:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	like i said, im not attracted to both genders, im attracted to people, and their gender doesn't matter to me
2005-08-03T14:22:00.000Z	Slipjack	nJess	Still confused. Still sounds like bisexual to me, in which it gender doesn't matter either.
2005-08-03T14:22:00.000Z	nJess	Slipjack	thats basicly the only difference
