2010-07-06T19:30:00.000Z	wookienz		gents my apt-get has died - i am getting "unknown error executing gpgv" when using apt-get update
2010-07-06T19:32:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Is your system date correct http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=271904
2010-07-06T19:33:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	time is fine
2010-07-06T19:34:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	I'm performing an update as we speak just fine.
2010-07-06T19:34:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	When you say time I presume you've checked the date as well.
2010-07-06T19:34:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	yup
2010-07-06T19:38:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Does /usr/bin/gpgv exist?
2010-07-06T19:39:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	yes
2010-07-06T19:40:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Can you try running "sudo aptitude update" at the command prompt and pastebining any errors you get.
2010-07-06T19:42:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Can you also paste bin your sources /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-07-06T19:46:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	I've found this which maybe of interest to you http://www.unix.com/ubuntu/123074-cant-update-use-package-manager-gpg-error-2.html
2010-07-06T19:58:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	cant see a real solution there for me, so i will just download the sio and update the OS from that!
2010-07-06T20:00:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	As far as I can gather the solution was/is to recompile that package from source and then perform an update.  However I can understand you might not be comfortable with that and in honesty I'd do it on my own machine but I'm not comfortable enough to guide you through it on your machine.
2010-07-06T20:00:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	yeah thanks... where would i even begin to find the source files?
2010-07-06T20:02:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	screw it ill give it a go!
2010-07-06T20:04:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	I've found a copy at ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.1.tar.gz but I'm not sure if it's the best place from which to get it.
2010-07-06T20:04:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	got one, ran ./configure, and make, looks all fine... now what?
2010-07-06T20:04:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Try your "sudo aptitude update" again
2010-07-06T20:05:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	no joy. do i need to move the newly "make'd" file? or does it install it directly as part of the process/
2010-07-06T20:05:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	"make install" often installs it
2010-07-06T20:06:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	ok that worked, but update doesnt! ;(
2010-07-06T20:07:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Sorry wookienz that and the incorrect date are the only two causes I'm aware of.
2010-07-06T20:07:00.000Z	wookienz	eoke	right o thanks. ISO comgin down in abut 10 mins so ill install of that
2010-07-06T20:07:00.000Z	eoke	wookienz	Best of luck and at least you had a go which is often half the battle.
