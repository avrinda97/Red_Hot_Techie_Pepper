2007-07-26T10:51:00.000Z	bz0b		just checking if their are any vulnerabilites in feisty kernel 2.6.20-16 'cause my boss needs me to get into one of our ex-employees systems
2007-07-26T10:52:00.000Z	bz0b		i have user access but i need to escalate privlidges
2007-07-26T10:52:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	...why don't you simply boot from a CD?
2007-07-26T10:53:00.000Z	bz0b	Agrajag	if i boot from cd, can i change the root
2007-07-26T10:53:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	that's what chroot is for
2007-07-26T10:54:00.000Z	bz0b	Agrajag	so explain what would i do boot into live cd, open terminal and
2007-07-26T10:54:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	sudo chroot </media/root/filesystem> /bin/bash
2007-07-26T10:55:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	where that bit in <> is whereever your new root is
2007-07-26T10:55:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	you should then have a root shell, in the installed system, and can run passwd on his account
2007-07-26T10:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	there is no password on the liveCD, just hit enter
2007-07-26T10:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	on the liveCD?
2007-07-26T10:57:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	not that I know of
2007-07-26T10:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	So thenyou need to change it
2007-07-26T10:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	Boot it with a liveCD, chroot into the installed system, and run passwd on his account to change it. Then you can boot it back up and do what you want
2007-07-26T10:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	Yes, you do.
2007-07-26T10:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	I just told you how to use chroot. It's a very simple command. You need to know the mountpoint of the root filesystem that you want to chroot into
2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	mount
2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	you're not really getting it
2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	and no /root is not the root FS, that's the home directory of the root user
2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	that's the device, not the filesystem
2007-07-26T11:01:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	OK. The root filesystem is /.
2007-07-26T11:06:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	something like that, yes
2007-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	yes
2007-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	Agrajag	bz0b	thought the liveCD should mount stuff like that automatically to something like /media/sda1
