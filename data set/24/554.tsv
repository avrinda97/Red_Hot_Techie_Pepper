2011-06-09T17:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	MarKsaitis	a server is with you Ã© home, the cloud is the internet
2011-06-09T17:35:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	MarKsaitis	Lubuntu is a very light GUI that you can use for a server
2011-06-09T17:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	MarKsaitis	long term = 5 years, instead of 3 years
2011-06-09T21:59:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	MarKsaitis	maybe the best way to find out, is by trying them both
