2010-07-11T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	and there should be a uninstall program
2010-07-11T22:35:00.000Z	^Jay2^	sebsebseb	it wont uninstall at all :(
2010-07-11T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	 So  you have tried that?
2010-07-11T22:35:00.000Z	^Jay2^	sebsebseb	yes
2010-07-11T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	ok do you haev other programs installed in Wine that you still want? If so what?
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	^Jay2^	sebsebseb	none. iw ant to delete all my wine programs
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	ok this is easy then
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	view > show > hidden files and folders
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	in Home
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	^Jay2^		and delete .wine?
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	yes and then delete .wine
2010-07-11T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	however the menu entry will still be there,  unless you get rid of that as well
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	^Jay2^	sebsebseb	how about the file associations?
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	file associations ?
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	^Jay2^		if i purge wine from apt-get, will it remove all installed program?
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	no
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	only config files of some sort I guess, and .wine will still be there
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	^Jay2^	sebsebseb	yeah like if i open .docx it will try opening word 2007
2010-07-11T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	no it won't, when .wine is gone
2010-07-11T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	also you can remove  the wine program itself
2010-07-11T22:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	and if I remember correctly the menu enteries for Wine are in .config
2010-07-11T22:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	^Jay2^	so remove all that and bye bye Wine stuff properly
