2012-01-30T15:15:00.000Z	wadkar		can someone please tell me the default color pallet for terminals (gnome terminal)
2012-01-30T15:16:00.000Z	wadkar		I was trying out different color scheme for my terminal and now its ruined ! please, help me restore it back to what it was
2012-01-30T15:17:00.000Z	wadkar		I cant work with these horrible colors !
2012-01-30T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	what did you do to try a different color scheme?
2012-01-30T15:18:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	I unchecked "Use colors from system theme" and then fiddled with Built-in schemes , and I think I also changed the color pallet available for terminal applications
2012-01-30T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	why not check "Use colors from system theme" again?
2012-01-30T15:21:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	tried, but the color pallet thingy is fudged up now :(
2012-01-30T15:23:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	my text color is in horrible bright pink (magenta)
2012-01-30T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	is this in gnome-terminal
2012-01-30T15:23:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	yes
2012-01-30T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	can't you choose a built-in scsheme from the dropdown menu?
2012-01-30T15:25:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	If I chose colors from system theme, the built-in scheme disappears, but i can still select color pallets though
2012-01-30T15:25:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	ohh thank god ! the color pallet default is 'tango' it seems
2012-01-30T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	you can choose built-in scheme for the palette :)
2012-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	yes, thats what I did, and looks like I have been using 'tango' from beginning, I only realized now that white-on-black custom scheme for text color with this color pallet is a horrible choice !
2012-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	only make changes you like :)
2012-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	hehe, yeah, but any change I make look unsatisfying, only because I am too much used to the old theme
2012-01-30T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	here's what I use, maybe it will give you some ideas: http://i.imgur.com/0Dn2j.png
2012-01-30T15:37:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	interesting, thats some nice colorful terminal ... I have a requirement of transparent background (for terminal) though, do you reckon it will screw up such colorful theme ?
2012-01-30T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	I think that transparent terminals, while they may look pretty, just make things harder to read
2012-01-30T15:40:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	indeed, but I set the transparency level just enough to be able to read whats _behind_ the terminal window
2012-01-30T15:40:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	which I find quite productive when working with external API docs, or working on SQLyog while modifying data by hand
2012-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	wadkar	do what works for you; that workflow would be impossible for me.  It's much faster for me to just have the wind juxtaposed to my terminal
2012-01-30T15:44:00.000Z	wadkar	jrib	yep, I took the pains to get used to it, hated it in the beginning but found that content behind the terminal can be _quite interesting_ , *cough* , if you know what I mean :)
