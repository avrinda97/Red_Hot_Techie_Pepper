2007-10-03T13:04:00.000Z	stinkyfoot		hey i installed something from an executable and now i want to uninstall it
2007-10-03T13:04:00.000Z	stinkyfoot		but it doesn't show up in my package manager
2007-10-03T13:04:00.000Z	stinkyfoot		how do i do that
2007-10-03T13:06:00.000Z	stinkyfoot		genii can i use gksudo with bash?
2007-10-03T13:07:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	better not. To get a root shell, use 'sudo -i' in a terminal.
2007-10-03T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	"interactive" (man sudo)
2007-10-03T13:09:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	don't manipulate the installation like that. Better use a package manager to install/remove software
2007-10-03T13:10:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	i can't do that with this program
2007-10-03T13:10:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	which one is it?
2007-10-03T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	well, you'll probably have to remove all directories and menu entries manually
2007-10-03T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	use alacarte
2007-10-03T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	menu editor
2007-10-03T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	that depends on the package
2007-10-03T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	yeah
2007-10-03T13:13:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	erusul do you guys use tetex?
2007-10-03T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	I wrote my thesis using tetex, but switched to texlive halfway
2007-10-03T13:14:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	i'm trying to use texmaker with tetex
2007-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	just remove all of texmaker you can find without too much trouble. Then install texlive
2007-10-03T13:15:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	on top of tetex?
2007-10-03T13:16:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	no, it'll automatically replace tetex
2007-10-03T13:18:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	what was your thesis in?
2007-10-03T13:18:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	medical image analysis
2007-10-03T13:19:00.000Z	stinkyfoot	soundray	what kind of analysis? analytical, graphical, mathematical?
2007-10-03T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	stinkyfoot	anatomical segmentation of brain MR images
