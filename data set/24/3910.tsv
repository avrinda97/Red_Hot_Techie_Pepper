2007-09-17T12:08:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		finally my ubuntu CD arrived. I booted it as a liveCD and it seemed to have a kinda slow display. after installing will it be the same?
2007-09-17T12:10:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		does Ubuntu have fast default video drivers?
2007-09-17T12:11:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		does Ubuntu have fast default video drivers and also driver for mu other hardware (like Windows XP does)

2007-09-17T12:13:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	I'm not sure what you're asking exactly, but the first time I installed Xubuntu, after a little work the only things I was missing from Windows were support for my scanner and one game I liked that doesn't support Linux, and everything else seemed to work better with the exception of transparency on the desktop being sluggish, which is the fault of the ATI drivers, and those are getting major improvements this month and next 
2007-09-17T12:14:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	is there a way to choose "classic theme" in Ubuntu like in windows?
2007-09-17T12:16:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	There are different themes for Ubuntu, although I use XFCE rather than Gnome so I don't know as much about the choices as I might. It would not surprise me if there is a theme out there that looks a lot like Windows Classic. It wouldn't surprise me if there's one that looks like the default XP theme either, although that would obviously be in bad taste.
2007-09-17T12:19:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	I recommend trying XFCE, but you should be able to change the Ubuntu theme pretty easily as well. Look in your menu under Settings for something about Window Manager Settings, it's probably in there.
2007-09-17T12:20:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	is XFCE a desktop like KDE/Gnome
2007-09-17T12:21:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	yes. It's supposed to be a little faster, and it's definitely a little simpler. It suits me pretty well, but it's not for everyone. I'd go look at your window manager settings before trying a different desktop environment. That's where you change the borders and buttons and such.
2007-09-17T12:22:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	do u mean the window manager settings that I currently use in ma Windos?
2007-09-17T12:23:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	I mean the window manager settings in Gnome or KDE.
2007-09-17T12:25:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	look. In windows XP - after installation I turn the fancy theme off by choosing "classic" and it becomes nice and smooth for me. Which mode and in which desktop offers the same level of smoothness in Ubuntu?
2007-09-17T12:28:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	I use the Katiola style in XFCE, personally. For gnome, you might like something like http://art.gnome.org/themes/metacity/1342 or something. KDE I'd have to do another search on.
2007-09-17T12:29:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	I have Ubuntu and Kubuntu
2007-09-17T12:30:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	I run Xubuntu, so I'm not going to be as able to help you as some people might.
2007-09-17T12:30:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	what is Xubuntu?
2007-09-17T12:31:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	Xubuntu is to XFCE as Kubuntu is to KDE as Ubuntu is to Gnome
2007-09-17T12:31:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	oh I would order it if I knew
2007-09-17T12:32:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	you could always install xubuntu-desktop, although I've forgotten exactly how that works.
2007-09-17T12:33:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Kilroo	but I don't think there's Xubuntu CD for request, is there?
2007-09-17T12:34:00.000Z	Kilroo	_SiLENT_	No, Xubuntu does not have fee CD's to ship due to lack of funding. However, you can install the xubuntu-desktop package from the repositories.
