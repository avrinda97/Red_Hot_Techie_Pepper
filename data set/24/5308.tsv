2007-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		Does anyone know how long it takes to do a file system check on 2 tarabytes?
2007-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	quite some time :~~)
2007-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	Would you say half hour or so?
2007-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	it takes about 30mins todo my 300gb drive, so quite alot longer but it will depend on the data on the drive and the way its organised i guess. i dont think it can be predicted. its a case of suck it and see ;o
2007-01-06T13:46:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	Well, in this case we don't have choice. We did a reboot on a server and it started the file system check on boot. I think we hit our "days" limit.
2007-01-06T13:46:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	its been fscking for 24hrs?
2007-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	No!
2007-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	It's only been going for about 15 minutes or so.
2007-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	ah yes i see. i hope it dosen't take too long :~)
2007-01-06T13:49:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	I gues I need to call the person in front of the server and let them know. I'm just the remote addmin.
2007-01-06T13:49:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	yea. it might be wise to get a kvm hooked up so you can monitor it.
2007-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	I was told a monitor was pluged in but I'm not sure if they can see the bottem of the screen. The resolution might be set wrong.
2007-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	ah. i've gotta go get some munch. good luck (Y)
2007-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	Thanks. We will need all the luck we can get
2007-01-06T13:56:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	fyi you can use the tunefs tools to change the number of days that a disk requires a check and disable it all together
2007-01-06T13:56:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	Should it be disabled?
2007-01-06T13:57:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	i disable it on all my servers and make a point to run it once a month at a time thats convinient and isn't disrupting the services on the box
2007-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	Sounds like I need to do something like that. Doesn't this need to be done at boot or when the file systems arn't mounted
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	it does yea but you can tell it to fsck on the next boot
2007-01-06T13:59:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	I should look into this. some of the stuff I'm finding on google are saying "days". This is starting to look bad.
2007-01-06T14:02:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	for something that big i wouldn't be surprised, but it really depends on too many factors to predict like the speed of the discs, data on them, number of errors and such forth
2007-01-06T14:04:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	It's a 3ware SATA RAID setup. The os is about 600gig RAID 5. The data RAID is 1.4T's on RAID 10
2007-01-06T14:05:00.000Z	mooey	DigitalNinja	at least they are fast disks so it shouldn't take a day heh :)
2007-01-06T14:05:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	mooey	We are hoping.
