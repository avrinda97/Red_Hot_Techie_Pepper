2008-05-29T03:48:00.000Z	wepeel		okay, first problem. The system has told me that it's using restricted drivers (Atheros HAL and Support for Atheros 802.11 wireless LAN cards), but I cannot connect. When I go to network, everything is greyed out
2008-05-29T03:49:00.000Z	wepeel		oh
2008-05-29T03:49:00.000Z	wepeel		there's something new

2008-05-29T03:49:00.000Z	wepeel	Gin	didn't notice the 'unlock' thing
2008-05-29T03:50:00.000Z	wepeel	Gin	that's new to me...was it introduced in 7.x? (unlock)
2008-05-29T03:51:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	nope, it is introduced in Hardy I think
2008-05-29T03:51:00.000Z	Gin		I have never seen that before in Gutsy
2008-05-29T03:53:00.000Z	Gin		that filesystem check thing is looking more like windows xp.... :S
2008-05-29T03:53:00.000Z	wepeel		okay, wireless card finds my connection...I've got the right WEP key...let's see

2008-05-29T03:53:00.000Z	wepeel		my very first impression of hardy heron is that it's fast
2008-05-29T03:54:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	I second that. for me, only pulseaudio is troublesome.
2008-05-29T03:55:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	I recommend you to check out gnome-main-menu
2008-05-29T03:56:00.000Z	wepeel	Gin	will I need to get that?
2008-05-29T03:57:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	using sudo apt-get install gnome-main-menu

2008-05-29T04:00:00.000Z	wepeel	Gin	do I need to add a repository to get it?
2008-05-29T04:00:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	don't think so. it is already in the default repo's
2008-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	wepeel	Gin	not found let me try updating as I haven't had this done yet
2008-05-29T04:03:00.000Z	Gin	wepeel	sudo apt-get update  , do that first
