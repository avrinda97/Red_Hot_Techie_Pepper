2011-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	imachine		hello
2011-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	imachine		i have an issue updating from 11.04 to 11.10
2011-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	imachine		anyone can help me?
2011-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	rahduke	imachine	whats the issue?
2011-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	i suppose it's because I've used backports and proposed repos on 11.04
2011-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	and now some packages are causing conflicts.
2011-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	ideally, I'd "wipe" my packages (downgrade them to the best currently available source via the internets)
2011-10-20T02:28:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	that way I'd get stable and security updates, because I've disabled backports and proposed repos.
2011-10-20T02:28:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	any ideas how I could go on about doing that ?
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	rahduke	imachine	during your upgrade didnt the installer give you the option to disable old repos?
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	it did, but the installed packages seem to cause conflicts.
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	at least, that's what the error message tells me.
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	maybe I could also resolve those issues manually, but for sanity's sake, I'd like the first option that I've proposed to become reality ;)
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	rahduke	imachine	did you reconfigure dkpg?
2011-10-20T02:29:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	well, no, but... should I really?
2011-10-20T02:30:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	like, dpkg --configure -all ?
2011-10-20T02:30:00.000Z	rahduke	imachine	ive had repo issues before and dkpg reconfigure fixed it, i forget the command but Im sure google can help
2011-10-20T02:30:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	yeah, that's not it I'm afraid.
2011-10-20T02:30:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	no packages get installed.
2011-10-20T02:31:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	so, if I could downgrade my packages to currently available internet repo versions, even if they're lower versions than the ones installed.
2011-10-20T02:31:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	that'd be the best solution.
2011-10-20T02:33:00.000Z	rahduke	imachine	yea thats what i was thinking, im really not sure.... i'd suggest a format and re-install, im sure thats not the solution your looking for but when your repo's are screwed and your messing with backports even if you are able to restore the OS to the point where it functions it will most likely still be messed up in one way or another
2011-10-20T02:34:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	because of installs?
2011-10-20T02:34:00.000Z	imachine	rahduke	well, I've brought back to life a box which got shut off during an upgrade ;)
