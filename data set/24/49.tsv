2012-10-29T02:06:00.000Z	Evdb		hey guys, huge problem
2012-10-29T02:07:00.000Z	Evdb		I was running Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro after a lot of struggling, then I installed an Nvidia driver and everything effed up. Now I'm back to zero. When I try to boot from USb I get busybox, what is it and what's the solution? Need Ubuntu for exams in one week D:
2012-10-29T02:08:00.000Z	Evdb		which drive?
2012-10-29T02:09:00.000Z	Evdb		Hmm that's not really an option and I kinda already did, I only have my MAC OS X partition and unallocated space for Ubuntu cracked_lucidity
2012-10-29T02:10:00.000Z	Evdb		Does anyone know how to get rid off busybox, preventing me from booting into live USB Ubuntu?
2012-10-29T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	did you MD5 test the ISO you put on the USB?
2012-10-29T02:11:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	can you explain that to me? I'm not familiar with that
2012-10-29T02:12:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	but I have a Mac :s But I'll take a look ty
2012-10-29T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	not the installed OS, the live CD or USB you installed with
2012-10-29T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	sounds like Grub isn't booting the OS. I suggest you chroot the installed OS from live USB and reinstate grub etc
2012-10-29T16:17:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	could you eplain that a bit more? I don't really understand what you mean :p
2012-10-29T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video   pretyped as i knew you'd ask
2012-10-29T16:17:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	hahaha thanks mate :) I'll keep you updated
2012-10-29T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	you can, you can boot to the device you installed with to get an OS that runs in RAM. There is an option to 'Try Ubuntu' which you can use
2012-10-29T16:21:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	yeah but I get 'busybox', can't boot into it
2012-10-29T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	when you boot the installation media you use, you get a busybox?
2012-10-29T16:23:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	using the live USB (I removed my Linux partition + swap)
2012-10-29T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	did you MD5 test the ISO you put on the USB stick?
2012-10-29T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	I suggest you recreate the stick. You can use unetbootin on most OSes
2012-10-29T16:25:00.000Z	Evdb	ActionParsnip	Haven't used unetbootin, but I'll try that one then yeah
2012-11-02T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	installs, removes and queries the packages
2012-11-02T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	dpkg does the installing work, apt-get does the dependancy matching and so forth
2012-11-29T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	ask away
2012-11-29T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evdb	i'd ask in #bash
