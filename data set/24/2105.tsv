2009-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	bullgard4		'smbtree' reports an error "tdb(unnamed): tdb_open_ex: could not open file /var/run/samba/gencache.tdb: Permission denied" in http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/394831/ . What is the function of the file /var/run/samba/gencache.tdb?
2009-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	as i said i believe that gencache.tdb stores address resolution data.. is this affecting samba i believe that is ignorable

2009-04-21T10:59:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	ok
2009-04-21T11:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	Do you know what the filename extension 'tdb' stands for in /var/run/samba/gencache.tdb?
2009-04-21T11:10:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	usually tdb are temporary db files used be a application
2009-04-21T11:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	Thank you for explaining.
2009-04-21T11:11:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	as per centeris i usually clear out a tdb file when there is a cache issue
2009-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	i use centeris to merge AD users/groups in a linux environment.. when a windows user can't log in,, we blow the tdb file and restart centeris
2009-04-21T11:13:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	this creates a new tdb... but in ur case i believe that ur tdb is caching name resulutions.. and u may nor not be able to do this.. who owns the file?
2009-04-21T11:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	root/root
2009-04-21T11:14:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	i dont think samba is malfunctioning for you is it?
2009-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	It is malfunctioning. If I issue the smbtree command with loglevel 0, I will not obtain any output. nmbd and smbd do exist though. "Earlier" everything functioned all right. I do not know what has changed.
2009-04-21T11:16:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	i see.. a new question.. why are u running samba as root?
2009-04-21T11:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	I don't know why I do that. I usually start running a command without the sudo prefix. Only if I get insufficient response, I will prepend it with sudo.
2009-04-21T11:18:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	do u have any other examples of ur error that u can paste?
2009-04-21T11:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	No. This error is new to me.
2009-04-21T11:21:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	new to my eyes as well but it appears to be based on a perm issue..
2009-04-21T11:25:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	trying to google on that a bit
2009-04-21T11:27:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	did u build samba from source?
2009-04-21T11:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	I have done so yet. All my efforts were in vain yet. But I am continuing. (My feeling is that I am missing some important background information.)
2009-04-21T11:27:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	i see something about those fileson debian belong under /var/cache where is that *.tdb file located for you?
2009-04-21T11:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	BladeNBrocade	No, from the Ubuntu repositories. And I upgraded them since Ubuntu 6.06. But everything worked all right until recently.
2009-04-21T11:30:00.000Z	BladeNBrocade	bullgard4	lol i guess we can scratch then huhh =)
