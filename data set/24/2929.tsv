2008-06-21T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	the comments in the bug for your issue is usually where you can get some answers
2008-06-21T16:55:00.000Z	msingh`		give me a link
2008-06-21T16:55:00.000Z	msingh`		it's not like i havent spend many hours of my life searching google already
2008-06-21T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	you said you were sure one was filed.
2008-06-21T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	bugs.ubuntu.com
2008-06-21T16:57:00.000Z	msingh`	jrib	that's not helpful
2008-06-21T16:58:00.000Z	msingh`		why is it a keyring issue?
2008-06-21T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	it is.  Search for your issue.  "samba sharing is broken" isn't a helpful description even if someone was willing to search for you
2008-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	msingh`	jrib	it is broken though!
2008-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	msingh`		sharing doesnt work -- what more can i say?
2008-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	msingh`		http://www.jonathanmoeller.com/screed/?p=181
2008-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	start with that then.  And compare the bug reports about broken sharing to your situation
2008-06-21T16:59:00.000Z	msingh`		that's the first hit on google. so i see more and more poeopel are having the same problem
2008-06-21T17:00:00.000Z	msingh`	jrib	there is not much more to say. the silly ubuntu maintainer who broke iit nows needs to step up
2008-06-21T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	open source is a two way street between users and developers.  I don't understand why you would prefer to rant instead of helping with the bug process
2008-06-21T17:01:00.000Z	msingh`	jrib	how do you propose i help? it's been months since this bug came about

2008-06-21T17:03:00.000Z	msingh`	jrib	i dont know.
2008-06-21T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	msingh`	this is my point.  The best place for you to get insight into your issue and to help in solving it is bugs.ubuntu.com
