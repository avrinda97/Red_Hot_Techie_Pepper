2006-08-25T16:20:00.000Z	bina		Hi, I'm trying to get my ATI to use the ATI rendering libraries rather than the Mesa ones so I can use direct rendering.  I've followed a load of tutorials on google but still not using the ati libs.  I thought I'd try removing libgl1-mesa-dri but it wants to get rid of x-window-system-core.  Is that just a meta package or is that quite dangerous to get rid of?
2006-08-25T16:21:00.000Z	FRET	bina	are you using the ati-kernel-module?
2006-08-25T16:23:00.000Z	bina	FRET	I believe the tutorials got me isntalling linux-restricted-modules... and xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-08-25T16:24:00.000Z	FRET	bina	yes
2006-08-25T16:24:00.000Z	FRET	bina	have you edited your xorg.conf after that?
2006-08-25T16:25:00.000Z	bina	FRET	yeah i did aticonfig --initial and made sure all the Driver bits in the Device sections were fglrx
2006-08-25T16:25:00.000Z	bina	FRET	the position of the image on the screen shifted horizontally slightly too so I think it did so something.
2006-08-25T16:26:00.000Z	FRET	bina	have you restarted X?
2006-08-25T16:26:00.000Z	bina	FRET	many times, rebooted the whole PC too
2006-08-25T16:27:00.000Z	FRET	bina	ok...and then you did what to check if it works?
2006-08-25T16:28:00.000Z	bina	FRET	first I checked fglrxinfo for what Libraries it was using (said all Mesa, think it should be all ATI), then I checked glxinfo to see whether the 'Direct Rendering' line said yes (it said no)
2006-08-25T16:29:00.000Z	FRET	bina	and you have no problems when starting X?
2006-08-25T16:30:00.000Z	bina	FRET	no,  none that I'm aware of at least
2006-08-25T16:30:00.000Z	bina	FRET	I have the ATI Drivers off their site now, you think its worth me trying them out?  Could be a bug in the dapper package maybe?
2006-08-25T16:30:00.000Z	FRET	bina	that's strange...
2006-08-25T16:31:00.000Z	FRET	bina	I'm using the dapper ones, and they work beautifully
2006-08-25T16:31:00.000Z	FRET	bina	maybe check again if all necessary drivers and modules are installed, and have a look at xorg.conf again
2006-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	FRET		maybe dmesg gives some ihnt
2006-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	FRET		hint
2006-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	bina	FRET	oh lots of errors in dmesg just seen
2006-08-25T16:33:00.000Z	bina	FRET	dmesg | grep fglrx puts 8 [17181093.744000]  [fglrx:firegl_unlock]  *ERROR* Process 7354 using kernel context 0, all different process numbers
2006-08-25T16:34:00.000Z	FRET	bina	maybe you can google for that...I cannot help you, sorry.
2006-08-25T16:34:00.000Z	bina	FRET	ok, well thanks.  Hopefully I'll get it sorted soon, then I can play with compiz :)
2006-08-25T16:35:00.000Z	FRET	bina	you're welcome....
