2010-06-05T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BenFrank	not really. Can you give the output of: uname -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf    use http://pastebin.com
2010-06-05T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BenFrank	ok well you have too many flash plugins and they are conflicting
2010-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BenFrank	http://pastebin.com/pncJQCZK
2010-06-05T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BenFrank	all as one command will remove all flash packages then give you the 64bit plugin alone, this will work fine
2010-06-05T22:55:00.000Z	BenFrank	ActionParsnip	i'll do it.
2010-06-05T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BenFrank	i gave a link to a pastebin for you to use
