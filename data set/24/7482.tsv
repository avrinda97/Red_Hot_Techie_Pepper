2004-12-10T15:33:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	i dont use blender....sorry, never managed to understand the interface
2004-12-10T15:34:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	everyone says that, but how many 3d tools has almost for every other platform out there ;) ?
2004-12-10T15:34:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	read the docs ;) and the community is quite helpfull too
2004-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	i will ... if i need to do 3d stuff .... currently i'm fine with fake 3d with gimp and inkscape :)
2004-12-10T15:36:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	then it will be in hoary, fine :)
2004-12-11T13:27:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	amg64 i guess....
2004-12-11T13:27:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	amg?  you mean amd ?
2004-12-11T13:29:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	aha...I cant use 64bit myself, I have a friend that has...who wants to use it
2004-12-11T13:31:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	you mean AMD and not Intel ?
2004-12-11T13:31:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	xeon is a intel cpu
2004-12-11T13:32:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	I know...  but why does it say ' linux-image-2.6-amd64-xeon'  <---- amd64
2004-12-11T13:32:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	its another kernel image.....i way just astonished
2004-12-11T13:33:00.000Z	ogra	ztonzy	i thin intel had to make the xeon64 compatible to the amd64 standard or someting.....which is really funny, becaues its normally the other way around
2004-12-11T13:33:00.000Z	ztonzy	ogra	lol, yepp
