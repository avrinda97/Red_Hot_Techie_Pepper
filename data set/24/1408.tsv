2010-11-21T01:38:00.000Z	almostsix		I'm having keyboard problems. I'm running Lucid Lynx, converted from Xubuntu using http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome. I had the problem before, too. The problem is that, occasionally, keyboard input is ignored entirely. Changing the focus somewhere else and then back again fixes it.
2010-11-21T01:39:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	did you get any errors dumped into logs?
2010-11-21T01:41:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	Where and how would I check that? A friend of mine looked into that once, and found something. I can't remember how, though
2010-11-21T01:41:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	check your logs within /var/log/
2010-11-21T01:46:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	Well, I have lots of logs there. Which ones are probably relevant?
2010-11-21T01:47:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	i would start by looking in messages.log in about the time you had the issue
2010-11-21T01:49:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	Okay. I found this: http://pastebin.com/day5vBCh
2010-11-21T01:53:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-11-21T01:54:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	10.04.
2010-11-21T01:56:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	are you using a MS wireless keyboard by any chance?
2010-11-21T01:57:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	I'm not. I'm on a netbook (MSI Wind).
2010-11-21T02:00:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	not sure if this can help in 10.04 but did you try to stop the hotkey-setup process? [sudo /etc/init.d/hotkey-setup stop]
2010-11-21T02:01:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	I get a 'command not found' when I try that.
2010-11-21T02:03:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	hmmm k
2010-11-21T02:07:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	by any chance do you get the same issue from over an external keyboard (USB) ?
2010-11-21T02:09:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	I'll check and see
2010-11-21T02:10:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	I've bumbed into a reported bug [Bug #517653] which is almost identical to yours. They have reported that by using an external keyboard the problem fades away
2010-11-21T02:10:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	I still get the problem, in the same way.
2010-11-21T02:11:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	same errors dumbed too?
2010-11-21T02:13:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	hm, not that I can see. But, I also can't really correlate the timing of the other error messages with when I get the problem.
2010-11-21T02:18:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	There isn't anything in messages at the exact time of the problem, as far as I can tell. The majority of messages (besides everything associated with booting up) is just like that excerpt I put on pastebin, though.
2010-11-21T02:22:00.000Z	FiNKu	almostsix	you need to locate what is causing the issue, tailing the logfiles can be a method
2010-11-21T02:23:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	Okay. I've been looking through various ones, and none have fit so far. I'll keep searching, though
2010-11-21T02:33:00.000Z	almostsix	FiNKu	I don't see anything. I've checked all of the log files, I believe. I've certainly checked all of the ones that don't seem absurd.
