2011-04-18T05:18:00.000Z	pfifo	multipass_	there should be an option for it in grub

2011-04-18T05:22:00.000Z	multipass_	pfifo	i have been, but it does the same thing and dies after init-bottom.. looks just like doing no silent splash
2011-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	pfifo	multipass_	and you said you installed some virtualbox stuff?
2011-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	multipass_	pfifo	yeah
2011-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	multipass_	pfifo	i may have updated ubuntu a little yesteday too
2011-04-18T05:24:00.000Z	pfifo	multipass_	It sounds like you were given a bad kernel module, perhaps a version mismatch. You should reinstall to the latest version of ubuntu
2011-04-18T05:25:00.000Z	multipass_	pfifo	i was on 10.10 and was just upgrading some packages hmm
2011-04-18T05:26:00.000Z	pfifo	multipass_	if you really wanted to you could try to locate the module, and delete it, but its going to be alot LOT quicker to just reinstall.
2011-04-18T05:27:00.000Z	multipass_	pfifo	ah ok, thanks for help, trying one last thing at bottom of this page - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/430272
