2005-10-24T06:24:00.000Z	Milk_		Good evening.. I'm having a severe problem with the breezy upgrade.. can anyone help?
2005-10-24T06:26:00.000Z	Milk_		and now I've lost ability to startx completely
2005-10-24T06:26:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	what is the error when it 'stops'
2005-10-24T06:26:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	error processing [package name[
2005-10-24T06:27:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	any more information than that
2005-10-24T06:27:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	is there a way to cut and paste in the CLI?
2005-10-24T06:28:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	I personally dont know of one
2005-10-24T06:29:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	it says "trying to overwrite '/usr/share/libofx/dtd/open.dcl' which is also in package libofx0c102
2005-10-24T06:29:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	my advice is to remove the libofx0c102 then do the upgrade and reinstall that package if needed
2005-10-24T06:29:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	I will try
2005-10-24T06:30:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	ok
2005-10-24T06:32:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	I removed the entire directory and its still giving the same error
2005-10-24T06:33:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	you dont remove the directory, you uninstall the package
2005-10-24T06:33:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	it won't let me.. tells me to run apt-get -f install
2005-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	ok run that apt-get -f install
2005-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	and I will look at what else you can do
2005-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	I did.. same error as the dist-upgrade
2005-10-24T06:35:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	ok, what if you just do apt-get install  libofx0c102
2005-10-24T06:36:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	if I do that, it wants the -f install again
2005-10-24T06:37:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	thats rough, you're in dependancy hell, but theres always a way out
2005-10-24T06:37:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	and without a browser, I'm lost.. haha
2005-10-24T06:39:00.000Z	propagandhi	Milk_	hang on a bit
2005-10-24T06:39:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	I have little other options.. hehe..
2005-10-24T06:53:00.000Z	Milk_	propagandhi	any luck yet?
