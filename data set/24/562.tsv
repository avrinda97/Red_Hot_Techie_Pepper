2011-06-04T04:47:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		Anyone familiar with writing audio drivers/ probing audio hardware with HDAAnalyzer?
2011-06-04T04:48:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	I wish I was.  then I would fix my sound/vid issues.
2011-06-04T04:52:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	what family card?
2011-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	I had that problem with 10.xx
2011-06-04T05:00:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	it's well documented in the forums.  I just can't find an acceptable solution. digitalstimulus: that's because i wrote it.
2011-06-04T05:16:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	what's your problem?
2011-06-04T05:16:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	which ver of ubuntu?
2011-06-04T05:17:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	latest and "greatest"
2011-06-04T05:17:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	it's an ICH9, (unsupported hardware by alsa)
2011-06-04T05:19:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	ah... that's a kernel problem, not an ubuntu problem.  if realtek would only release linux drivers we would all be happy.
2011-06-04T05:20:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	I was told I could use hda-analyzer  to probe the codec and find the speaker, problem is, I have almost no idea which pin to enable.
2011-06-04T05:21:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	does hda-analyser have a man page?  look for the contact details of the dev at the bottom.
2011-06-04T05:23:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/HDA_Analyzer    no man page
2011-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	/join #alsa
2011-06-04T05:25:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	already am in #alsa
2011-06-04T05:25:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	also in ##hardware just in case anyone there knew
2011-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	sorry if we don't know.
2011-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	really?
2011-06-04T05:29:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	fantastic
2011-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	are those open source drivers?
2011-06-04T05:32:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	quoting the readme  "This Source Code is from www.alsa-project.org."
2011-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	got a link to the driver?
2011-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	r0fs3ck5	so it looks like I already may have had it installed
2011-06-04T05:39:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	rinkukokiri	I see it.
