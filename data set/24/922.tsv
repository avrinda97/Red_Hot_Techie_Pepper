2012-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	diverdude		hello. when i want to mount a external HD. How do i know which /dev/sda to mount?
2012-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	it should show up automatically in places, but you can use dmesg to find the drive after you plug it in
2012-01-08T17:30:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	ah ok...it shows /dev/sdb1 how do i then mount this?
2012-01-08T17:30:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	mount -t <filesystem> <mountpoint>
2012-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	how do i know the filesystem?
2012-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	mount -t <filesystem> /dev/sdb1 <mountpoint>
2012-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	i missed the device part; to know the filesystem you can use parted, or if you formatted it, you should remember :)
2012-01-08T17:32:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	parted? will it do anything to the disk or will it just inspect it?
2012-01-08T17:32:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	parted _can_ do things to it, you have to be careful
2012-01-08T17:34:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	do "sudo parted /dev/sdb" then in parted hit "p" for print, and it will tell you the filesystem
2012-01-08T17:34:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	then hit "q" to exit parted
2012-02-17T12:34:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	65536
2012-03-22T10:35:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	usually it works like that
2012-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	you're trying to add a ppa to update the kernel? why?
2012-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	no im trying to update php to 5.4
2012-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	then why is the kernel in there
2012-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	no idea
2012-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	it was already there i think
2012-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	which ppa are you using
2012-03-22T10:39:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	im using this: https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5
2012-03-22T10:40:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	open up synaptic and mark all the upgrades
2012-03-22T10:40:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	cant i just upgrade everything with a command?
2012-03-22T10:41:00.000Z	Ben64	diverdude	you'd probably have to specify what to upgrade, because something in those upgrades requires the removal of something else most likely
2012-03-22T10:42:00.000Z	diverdude	Ben64	ok...now i opened the update manager. I think it will work fine
