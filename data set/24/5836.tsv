2006-06-01T13:54:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	FunnyHat_Work	ok... well, I tried to install fedora on an external drive...

2006-06-01T13:54:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	FunnyHat_Work	no...

2006-06-01T13:54:00.000Z	FunnyHat_Work	pianoboy3333	more than likely your bootload was fscked.
2006-06-01T13:55:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	FunnyHat_Work	how can i fix this?
2006-06-01T13:55:00.000Z	FunnyHat_Work	pianoboy3333	best way to fix...  hmm.   Google for grub tutorials.
2006-06-01T13:55:00.000Z	FunnyHat_Work	pianoboy3333	you're going to have to do some console work in /boot/ and type something like ./grub i think
2006-06-01T13:55:00.000Z	FunnyHat_Work	pianoboy3333	check out the !grub help from ubotu
2006-06-01T13:56:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	FunnyHat_Work	how can I use fsck? I unmounted all of my drives
