2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	rpj8		Hey guys. I'm trying to compile kazehakase from source and it doesn't get past ./configure
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	rpj8		Anyone have problems compiling that john?
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	that's not an ubuntu issue
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	get support from the vendor
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	I apologize, thought I was in #linux
2008-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	no problem
2008-02-13T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	not iwconfig
2008-02-13T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	is it a linux box
2008-02-13T21:31:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	Well I am asking in a ubuntu channel, so :P
2008-02-13T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	ok - your machine isn't in a domain unless you've conifgued nis or nis+ or ldap, you can use samba as a 3rd part tools to join windows domains which will be listed in your /etc/smb.conf file
2008-02-13T21:33:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	I meant networking wise. Not a workgroup. as in my box's name is host, so: host.as.something.edu
2008-02-13T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	it won't be part of a domain unless you put it in, or do you mean your ISP's domain
2008-02-13T21:35:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	I mean my ISP (university's) domian
2008-02-13T21:35:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	your domain is oakland.resnet.pitt.edu
2008-02-13T21:35:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	Ok, but how can I figure that out without using IRC.
2008-02-13T21:36:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	your machine can be a member of 100 domains, so it's up to the people who administrate their domains.
2008-02-13T21:37:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	I kinda mean what would appear as my email from this box: rpj@TheFunk.*.*.*, and how do I figure that out from the command line
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	that will depend on the "FROM" address
2008-02-13T21:38:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	it will also depend on the domain name the mail relay you are using is set to come from and the domain name your ip block is assigned to
2008-02-13T21:39:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	Ok, how do I figure out the domain name my ip address is assigned to. That's what I should have asked in the first place.
2008-02-13T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	nslookup your IP address or use an RIPE lookup on the interent
2008-02-13T21:40:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	Ok, now what's really bad is I'm not sure how I can figure out my IP. iwconfig comes up blank. I had to jump through some fancy hoops to get networking to work at my uni
2008-02-13T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rpj8	ifconfig
2008-02-13T21:41:00.000Z	rpj8	ikonia	I'm an idiot. thanks
