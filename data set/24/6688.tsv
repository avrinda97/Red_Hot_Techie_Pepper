2006-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	tomaj		whats an IM program that supports msn voice convos?
2006-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	msn messenger ?
2006-02-27T16:34:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	on ubuntu obviously
2006-02-27T16:34:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	according to gaim.sf.net gaim2 beta still does not support voice - in any capacity
2006-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	hmm ok
2006-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	skype is your best bet right now
2006-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	ok thanks
2006-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	be aware there is a device locking issue with skype tho
2006-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	device locking?
2006-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	last time I checked, there is a documented bug with skype:linux, whereby it does not release the sound device after you use it - preventing other apps using your sound device
2006-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	oh ok
2006-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	fuck that then lol
2006-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	never mind that then
2006-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	you will need to hack in asynch sound support into ubuntu too, but its possible :)
2006-02-27T16:38:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	lol nvm ill just live without voice conversations
2006-02-27T16:38:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	if you think thats a hastle, you should try playing around with multihead in ubuntu :)
2006-02-27T16:39:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	i dont even want to know what multihead is lol, its sounds kinda kinky tho
2006-02-27T16:39:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	using more than one monitor on your computer
2006-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	oh isnt that easy? dont you just use the control pannel?
2006-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	what control panel ?
2006-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	what card?
2006-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	for ati right now there are several device drivers you can "try" - all of which will require you to manually edit your xorg.conf to get multihead working
2006-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	tomaj	p0windah	fglrx doesnt work with control pannel?
2006-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	p0windah	tomaj	and none of the methods to do it are superior to the others, each has a major downside..
