2010-11-11T20:10:00.000Z	Aufwind		I am using TorProject (Vidala + Tor Button) to hide my ip online. With firefox it works great. Now I have a script (parsing google Scholar) and I want to change the ip for every request I do, so I stay hidden from big brother. How is this managable? If vidala is on, does this mean, that anything, that I do with ma computer runs through the Tor network or only the things I make with firefox?
2010-11-11T20:10:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	    have you got it working with xchat?
2010-11-11T20:10:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   trying to work on that now
2010-11-11T20:11:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Nope, I didn't. I don't use xchat.
2010-11-11T20:11:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	I just want my python script to run through the tor network
2010-11-11T20:12:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   well, tor needs to be configured to work with whatever you're doing  just like Firefox, or xchat for that matter..    you're not hidden just because you have it running
2010-11-11T20:12:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	  maybe you already know that
2010-11-11T20:13:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Yes, but I don't know how to configure tor, so that it works with my terminal... You got a hint for me?
2010-11-11T20:14:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   no sorry,  i asked a similar question yesterday but it's all a bit beyond me right now
2010-11-11T20:14:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Thank you anyway and good look for your own problem. =)
2010-11-11T20:18:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Did you see that? http://bit.ly/caargk XChat is listed below...
2010-11-11T20:20:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   no I haven't..  i just followed the steps at the project site  since the other isn't kept up to date (as they say)  https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian
2010-11-11T20:20:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	  i'll try it though, thanks!
2010-11-11T20:20:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	yw
2010-11-11T20:24:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	    this is what I get trying that method   http://paste.ubuntu.com/530050/
2010-11-11T20:25:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Sorry, but not into this stuff, either. I just passed the link to you, because I remembered, that you are looking for sth. that has to do with TOR and Xchat. :)
2010-11-11T20:31:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   yea i'm aware...  just weird the lack of documentation on xchat/tor usage   since both are pretty popular
2010-11-11T22:14:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	    /j  #tor
2010-11-11T22:15:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	   at this point it's not really an ubuntu specific issue
2010-11-11T22:16:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	  wish i knew..   also keep in mind you really don't need what you're asking for, unless you're doing something illegal or are just paranoid
2010-11-11T22:18:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	It is for science. :-) Nothing illegal. I just want to avoid the bans, and to automate my script, so I don't have to stick to my computer, while it is running. The results will be published in a paper next January. :)
2010-11-11T22:20:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	  try #linux   they seem a little more receptive of this stuff there
2010-11-11T22:20:00.000Z	goltoof	Aufwind	  and it's not dead
2010-11-11T22:20:00.000Z	Aufwind	goltoof	Thanks
