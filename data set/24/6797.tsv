2005-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	dragoon		err
2005-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	dragoon		deb http://download.skype.com/linux/repos/debian/ stable non-free
2005-12-13T08:16:00.000Z	brenner	dragoon	try seveas' deb.  ask ubotu about skype
2005-12-13T08:16:00.000Z	dragoon	ubotu	tell me about skype
2005-12-13T08:16:00.000Z	brenner	dragoon	download it, then install with 'sudo dpkg -i <deb file>'
2005-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	brenner	dragoon	it seemsd the issue you were having is actually described on the wiki page ubotu linked to
2005-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	dragoon		oh really ?
2005-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	brenner		i.e. the skype package doesn't list that qt one as a dependency
2005-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	brenner		so you'd need to install that one manualy beforehand
2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	dragoon		ok
2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	brenner	dragoon	or just use seveas' one, which i'd assume he'd set that dependency up for us
2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	dragoon		thanks
2005-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	brenner		np

2005-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	dragoon		yea :)
2005-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	brenner	dragoon	seveas's deb?
