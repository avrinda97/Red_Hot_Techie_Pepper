2011-01-10T02:32:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	ah ok.  well if it was what Im using, I had same problem with b43 driver... im since using non-free driver.
2011-01-10T02:34:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	can you use wpa1 instead?
2011-01-10T02:34:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	well the encrption I cannot decide as its the University network ..
2011-01-10T02:37:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	is this with maverick?
2011-01-10T02:37:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	yeah its with maverick
2011-01-10T02:37:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	tried with lucid?
2011-01-10T02:39:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	well with lucid I never had this problem
2011-01-10T02:40:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	hmmm.. go back to lucid :)  or,  try iwconfig wlan0 power off   (disables power management for the device)...a fix for an issue for some other chipset but might help.
2011-01-10T02:41:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	Do you know is thenew "n" standard supported on the wlagn driver ?
2011-01-10T02:41:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	I dont know anything about wlagn driver.. this is the first I have heard of it.
2011-01-10T02:42:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	I think you can use the lucid kernel in maverick....could try it...
2011-01-10T02:42:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	oh ok :) I read somewhr that the implementation of n std is not stable and my Univ uses that ..
2011-01-10T02:42:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	or install lucid .
2011-01-10T02:43:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	well I think I will do that .. downgrade :(
2011-01-10T02:43:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	it must have a fallback to g surely?
2011-01-10T02:43:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	well it does and I suspect thr is a glitch while its falling back to g ..
2011-01-10T02:45:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	stick to lucid.. its an LTS afterall.
2011-01-10T02:46:00.000Z	Kuby	mongy	yeah will downgrade it tomorrow :(
2011-01-10T02:46:00.000Z	mongy	Kuby	some people have issue with 10.10 and go back to 10.04
