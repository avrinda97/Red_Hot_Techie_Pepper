2005-07-09T05:05:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	about the modem, I don't know if it is a win modem or not
2005-07-09T05:05:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	I can't even figure out what brand it is
2005-07-09T05:07:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	what kind of puter is it?
2005-07-09T05:07:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	i'm 95% certain you have a winmodem
2005-07-09T05:07:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	what do U mean puter???
2005-07-09T05:08:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	it is in the laptop
2005-07-09T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	"puter" substandared abbreviation for "computer"
2005-07-09T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	is it built in? if so, i'm pretty sure its a winmodem
2005-07-09T05:08:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	sorry...:D
2005-07-09T05:08:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	yes it is build in
2005-07-09T05:09:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	but wasn't that there was a way to install drivers for win modems??
2005-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	winmodem support is still very small
2005-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	you'd be quicker finding a supported usb or hardware modem
2005-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	no, I know it is possible to fix this
2005-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	nalioth	afroman	there is a way for everything

2005-07-09T05:13:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	the modem is a PCtel HSP56 MR Modem
2005-07-09T05:14:00.000Z	afroman	nalioth	what linux do U run on an iBook
