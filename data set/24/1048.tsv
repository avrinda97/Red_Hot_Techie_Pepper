2010-09-01T22:11:00.000Z	Magnetro		I hope so.
2010-09-01T22:11:00.000Z	Magnetro		LOL
2010-09-01T22:12:00.000Z	Magnetro		I mean it's under the list
2010-09-01T22:12:00.000Z	Magnetro		Honestly, I haven't touched the configs.
2010-09-01T22:13:00.000Z	Magnetro		It's not as simple as the Zsnes which I have working w/e sound tho oddly
2010-09-01T22:13:00.000Z	Magnetro		Could not Launch Help Center
2010-09-01T22:14:00.000Z	Magnetro		Could not launch the KDE Help Center
2010-09-01T22:14:00.000Z	Magnetro		?? I pressed help handbook that that's what happened
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	jrib	Magnetro	are you using kde?
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	Magnetro		kxmame
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	jrib	Magnetro	not my question
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	Magnetro		it's too complicated for the likes of me.
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	Magnetro		oh
2010-09-01T22:15:00.000Z	Magnetro		what's kde?
2010-09-01T22:16:00.000Z	Magnetro		because I doubt that I am
2010-09-01T22:16:00.000Z	jrib	Magnetro	did you install regular ubuntu or kubuntu?
2010-09-01T22:16:00.000Z	Magnetro		regular unbuntu
2010-09-01T22:16:00.000Z	jrib	Magnetro	that's why help didn't work.  Why don't you just use command line like dr_willis suggested?
2010-09-01T22:20:00.000Z	Magnetro		jrib
2010-09-01T22:20:00.000Z	jrib		!ru | kubmob
2010-09-01T22:21:00.000Z	Magnetro	jrib	I don't know how to use the commandline for mame
2010-09-01T22:22:00.000Z	jrib	Magnetro	that makes two of us :)  Read documentation, also dr_willis gave hints before
