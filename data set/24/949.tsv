2012-08-10T10:47:00.000Z	scarleo		I cant get a correct listing of .gvfs even with root, who should own the .gvfs folder? And what permissions?
2012-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	Zenexer	scarleo	Which .gvfs folder?  The one in ~?
2012-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	yes, that one, I have ? for owner and permissions even when listing as root
2012-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	Zenexer		I think it should be you...
2012-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	Zenexer		Let me check
2012-08-10T10:49:00.000Z	Zenexer		Yeah, mine's owned by me
2012-08-10T10:49:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	great, thanks!
2012-08-10T10:49:00.000Z	scarleo		0700 ?
2012-08-10T10:51:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	chown: cannot access `.gvfs': Permission denied, and that is with root :/
2012-08-10T10:51:00.000Z	Zenexer		O.o
2012-08-10T10:51:00.000Z	Zenexer		Some sort of corruption, I suppose.
2012-08-10T10:51:00.000Z	scarleo		How did this even happen?
2012-08-10T10:51:00.000Z	scarleo		yeah, guess so
2012-08-10T10:52:00.000Z	Zenexer		I'm no expert on disk recovery, but see what you can run for disk checks.
2012-08-10T10:52:00.000Z	scarleo		trying reboot and forcefsck
2012-08-10T10:52:00.000Z	Zenexer		If it's just a messed up permission issue, something basic should catch it.
2012-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	Zenexer		There was a specific option with fsck that would be liable to fix that, and I'm blanking out on what it was
2012-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	I also have a lot of files in home created  "0 Jul" ??
2012-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	Zenexer		Sounds like it could be a bad disk, then.  Check the SMART status.
2012-08-10T11:17:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	ghostchick I did a forcefsck and everything is back to normal with my .gvfs folder :)
2012-08-10T11:18:00.000Z	Zenexer	scarleo	Yay!  Now double-check the SMART status to make sure your hard drive isn't about to die on you.
2012-08-10T11:18:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	it's fine, already checked, everything is green
2012-08-10T11:18:00.000Z	Zenexer	scarleo	Awesome.  Might've just been a power outage or something.
2012-08-10T11:19:00.000Z	scarleo	Zenexer	I had the laptop running this night to complete a backup, might have something to do with that
