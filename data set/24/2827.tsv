2008-07-31T21:04:00.000Z	mbiker		newb question... is there an easy way to upgrade Hardy release to have Apache 2.2.9 versus 2.2.8?
2008-07-31T21:05:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	you'll need to backport 2.2.9 from intrepid
2008-07-31T21:07:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	as i said. backport
2008-07-31T21:07:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	I dunno enough to just backport...  :)
2008-07-31T21:08:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	do you know how to add repositories?
2008-07-31T21:08:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	nope... willing to learn.  I figured out two upgrades with issues over ssh... so I should be able to do that
2008-07-31T21:09:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	i have a better idea, prevu should be able to help you.
2008-07-31T21:10:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	will look at that... thx!
2008-07-31T21:28:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	why would I want to use prevu over going down the adding repositories path?
2008-07-31T21:29:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	it's not advisable adding the intrepid binary repos to a hardy install - a mixed system like this could severly break things and you might not have ABI on hardy with a package built for intrepid
2008-07-31T21:30:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	that works
2008-07-31T21:31:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	Y/N:   You can have APT use the packages built by prevu by adding this to /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-07-31T21:32:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	is that something you are asking me?  or is that some message you are encountering?
2008-07-31T21:32:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	it was a question prevu is asking Y/N to
2008-07-31T21:33:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	hmm, i'm not sure - i would say no to this if this is the only package from intrepid that needs backporting
2008-07-31T21:34:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	if I understand the question... it is allowing apt to use a local repo versus a remote
2008-07-31T21:35:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	i'd say it was local though i can't say for sure just from that one line.
2008-07-31T21:35:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	 deb file:/var/cache/prevu/hardy-debs ./ is the one below it
2008-07-31T21:35:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	yea, it's a local repo then
2008-07-31T21:36:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	so a Y would be ok then... going for it :)
2008-07-31T21:36:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	ok :)
2008-07-31T22:11:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	worked through a couple dependency issues and got the system running apache 2.2.9.  Cool part is that the site was down for about 1s :)
2008-07-31T22:14:00.000Z	mbiker	unop	so thank you very much for the help!  now the question will be... does the problem go away
2008-07-31T22:18:00.000Z	unop	mbiker	I guess you'll have to find out .. fingers crossed :)
