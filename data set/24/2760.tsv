2008-08-29T00:31:00.000Z	intangir		i just checked my logs and over the last few days theres thousands of attempts
2008-08-29T00:32:00.000Z	intangir		PXE sounds like a network boot loader issue
2008-08-29T00:32:00.000Z	intangir		is there one that will tell me when new attempts start from a new IP?
2008-08-29T00:32:00.000Z	intangir		cause out of the thousand there were only 5 IPs
2008-08-29T00:33:00.000Z	intangir		chinese, indian, italian, US and unknown..
2008-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	intangir		like i have root login disabled and there were a ton of failed root logins
2008-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	intangir		i wonder if the people are coming from IRC?
2008-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	intangir		or just random
2008-08-29T00:34:00.000Z	intangir		i heard there was a massive security flaw with ssl a few months back
2008-08-29T00:35:00.000Z	intangir		ssh
2008-08-29T00:35:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	that's  already been repaired hasn'
2008-08-29T00:35:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	so they say, but the keys you generated during that period are still vulnerable
2008-08-29T00:36:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	that sounds like the DNS thing that was going on too
2008-08-29T00:36:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	what DNS thing?
2008-08-29T00:37:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	dns only lets you generate so many numbers if you do something sorta like a DDOS then you cna trick servers into reusing old keys or something like that, CNET's BOL did a big podcast on it
2008-08-29T00:38:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	exactly
2008-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	did you see my explanation on the whole DNS thing?
2008-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	ya but i dont really understand
2008-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	i'll see if i can find the podcast link
2008-08-29T00:39:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	cool
2008-08-29T00:42:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	here's the link, http://www.cnet.com/8301-11455_1-10010246-10.html
2008-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	you sure? i dont see any mention of dns
2008-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	McAfee17	intangir	it says "Blackhat 2008: dns flaw something previoulsy reported"
2008-08-29T00:44:00.000Z	intangir	McAfee17	thx
