2011-12-23T00:24:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		i have problems deleting a certain directory on my external hdd. the path is something like /media/hdd/folder1/folder2/.../folder7/folder8 - when i'm in folder7 and type "rm folder8", i get "cannot remove `folder8': directory not empty", and when i go into folder8 and type "ls", i get "reading directory .: Input/output error" - is there some way to "force delete" this directory? i understand it may be corrupted or something, is there anything e
2011-12-23T00:24:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop		lse i can do, save for reformatting the whole hdd?
2011-12-23T00:26:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	i had such error on nntpgrab for specific hd, i had to change dir
2011-12-23T00:27:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	what do you mean by "change dir"? i've tried renaming the folder in question, and that works, but i still can't delete it
2011-12-23T00:28:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	try deleting from nautilus as root
2011-12-23T00:30:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	no luck, same thing
2011-12-23T00:31:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	what about sending to trash first, then deleting as root
2011-12-23T00:46:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	you could try pysdm to auto fstab your partitions
2011-12-23T00:48:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	i have no idea what either of those are, but according to a quick google, fstab seems to be related to the partitions table on linux - i don't think that's where the problem is - this is an external hdd (formatted as NTFS), and i can't delete this particular folder at all. i've also tried deleting it from windows, and no luck there either
2011-12-23T00:51:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	you cant move the folder to trash neither?
2011-12-23T00:51:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	via nautilus you mean? as in, right click->move to trash? nope, that doesn't work
2011-12-23T01:00:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	try terminal: sudo nautilus and try to remove file from there
2011-12-23T01:01:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	i've already tried that. it doesn't work either
2011-12-23T01:02:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	seems like hardass lol
2011-12-23T01:03:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	what created this specific folder?
2011-12-23T01:04:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	a friend who i lent my hdd to; he copied some files to the hdd in order to move them to another pc; he had no problems copying them, afaik
2011-12-23T01:05:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	it may be worth mentioning that this folder where he placed all his files had around 100 thousand files, with very deep directories, with a total of ~5GB of data (ie. a LOT of tiny files), so it's probably windows that caused the corruption when copying them
2011-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	if you did not tryed pysdm i would reccomend, it auto mounts all your partitions, maybe more luck to remove the file from the new arrangement
2011-12-23T01:07:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	i'm not an advanced linux user by any shot, but i know enough that i can assume that your suggestion won't help me here
2011-12-23T01:08:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	maybe moving all other files to another hd and reformat?
2011-12-23T01:09:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	that's my last-resort-solution - i'd prefer not to do that, if possible
2011-12-23T01:12:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	bittyx-laptop	what was that input/output error again?
2011-12-23T01:13:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	ls: reading directory .: Input/output error
2011-12-23T01:13:00.000Z	bittyx-laptop	lotuspsychje	:D
