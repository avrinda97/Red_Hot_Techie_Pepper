2008-08-16T07:05:00.000Z	weternal		when you're setting up a dual boot which partition option do you want to use?
2008-08-16T07:06:00.000Z	weternal		what do I do after I pick manual for the dual boot partition?
2008-08-16T07:07:00.000Z	weternal		do I want to edit the current partition?
2008-08-16T07:08:00.000Z	weternal		um which option do I select in manual partition should I choose?
2008-08-16T07:08:00.000Z	weternal		it's got a 40 gig drive and it's ntfs
2008-08-16T07:09:00.000Z	weternal		can someone give me a hand?
2008-08-16T07:10:00.000Z	weternal		I'm trying to partition my disk so that I can get a computer running windows and ubuntu
2008-08-16T07:10:00.000Z	weternal		and I've already chosen the manual option
2008-08-16T07:10:00.000Z	weternal		and I'm trying to partition the disk
2008-08-16T07:11:00.000Z	weternal		hello? can someone tell me how I'm supposed to partition this disk
2008-08-16T07:11:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	do you want a separate home partition or not
2008-08-16T07:12:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	you need swap,  /  , and perhaps /home
2008-08-16T07:13:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	following so far
2008-08-16T07:13:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	do you need to hibernate, etc
2008-08-16T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	have you backed everything important up? if not, do so NOW.
2008-08-16T07:15:00.000Z	weternal	bazhang	so what do I do next
2008-08-16T07:15:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	yes
2008-08-16T07:16:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	have you really read nothing before today on this? this is a pretty dicey deal for a new user.
2008-08-16T07:17:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	then what are you trying to do.
2008-08-16T07:19:00.000Z	weternal	bazhang	I'm in the install screen for ubuntu right now and I'm trying to figure out how to partition it
2008-08-16T07:19:00.000Z	weternal	bazhang	it's asking me how I want to partition the disk
2008-08-16T07:20:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	did you read that link? the part about manual partitioning is quite explicit.
2008-08-16T07:21:00.000Z	bazhang	weternal	otherwise I am just cutting and pasting from the link, which is silly.
2008-08-16T07:21:00.000Z	weternal	bazhang	I might have missed the link, could you send it again
