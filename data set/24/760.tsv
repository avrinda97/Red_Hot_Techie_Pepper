2011-09-29T16:36:00.000Z	lorddelta		Again, if anyone knows if there is a process on official ubuntu distributions that archives new devices in /media as 7z archives, or if I'm rootkitted and need to do a clean installation...I'd greatly appreciate the input.
2011-09-29T16:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 there may be some fuse fuse filesystem addons to auto compress files. but it may depend on exactly what you want to do
2011-09-29T16:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 why would you think you are rootkitted?
2011-11-14T12:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 theres irssi tutorials out there that detail how to do it. I use weechat these days myself..
2011-11-14T12:56:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	btw thnx that was it
2011-11-14T12:56:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	the whole /window thing
2011-11-14T12:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 check out weechat some day. I perfer it 100x over irssi.
2011-11-14T12:57:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	will do
2011-11-14T12:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 also 'znc' works well with the console clients. :) I use znc on my linux box. and i irc to it.. it then bounces me here.. so i cen be connected with a dozen differnt irc clients.. and you just see me here once.
2011-11-14T12:59:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	Ah, yeah, seen a couple of those.
2011-11-14T12:59:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	Not sure of the relative benefits, but thnx anyways. :)
2011-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	thnx
2011-11-15T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 gnome shell is supposed to be very tweakable.. if you know javascript. i hear. ;)
2011-11-15T11:43:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	Fantastic. The one language I don't really like all that much...
2011-11-15T12:12:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	well I found the gnome-shell stuff ok, but I'm still hunting around for the configuration setting for gnome-terminal...would that be a gconf setting to enable emacs-style navigation in gnome-terminal, or has something changed with my bash?
2011-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 not sure. see if it works in xterm, rxvt, terminator, xfterm or others how you expect.
2011-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 it could be compiz/unity is grabbing the binding also,
2011-11-15T12:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 does it work in the console correctly?
2011-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	well...some of them. ^k kills to the end of line still, ^y yanks, but M-d doesn't delete, it just prints a "d" where the cursor was. Same in xterm.
2011-11-15T12:16:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	k thnx
2011-12-28T06:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 and its vague. :)
2011-12-28T06:42:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	Yeah, I apologize. I suppose I'm complimenting Ubuntu here; I don't know if there's a better place to do that.
2011-12-28T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	lorddelta	 #windows ? :)  nah..better not do that..
2011-12-28T06:43:00.000Z	lorddelta	dr_willis	haha yeah of course why didn't I think of that. ;)
