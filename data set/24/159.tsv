2012-06-05T04:21:00.000Z	jedieaston		hello? i have a question
2012-06-05T04:22:00.000Z	jedieaston		Its about wireless adapters. Does the Netgear wna1000M work natively in 12.04
2012-06-05T04:24:00.000Z	jedieaston		ok. i am trying to install wubi now. its downloading the 12.04 image
2012-06-05T04:25:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	if you can, avoid wubi.. people end up installing the real thing.. try to backup your windows data, and use gparted live cd to make 2 more partitions (one for / and one for swap)
2012-06-05T04:26:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	i've helped someone today fix their windows boot.. the ubuntu installer adds a boot option for windows automatically
2012-06-05T04:26:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	ok
2012-06-05T04:26:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	but what's the usb adapter?
2012-06-05T04:29:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	you may as well try to install ubuntu natively, this feedback was reported a year ago.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1806839
2012-06-05T04:29:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	so your usb device works with any linux (not just ubuntu)
2012-06-05T04:33:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	actually i can tell you right now, that your wifi will work with that usb (that report is a year old)
2012-06-05T04:34:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	but you can try wubi if you are unsure of the audio and video.. these are the other two devices that if its not automagic then it may be a pita to correct
2012-06-05T04:34:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	vm?
2012-06-05T04:34:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	wubi is not a vm
2012-06-05T04:35:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	it's a near-native install.. near-native because the "/" mountpoint (the heart of linux'es file system) is not directly from a new partition, but "within" a file on "top" of ntfs (so basically it's 1 file on your windows filesystem, and it'll be more than 4 gigs big)
2012-06-05T04:36:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	that won't guarantee it'll work natively..
2012-06-05T04:36:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	wubi would..
2012-06-05T04:37:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	wubi is safe.. but native is less safe (that's why i suggest to backup your data if you're doing a real native install)
2012-06-05T04:38:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	well you can always resize ntfs even after you shrink it..
2012-06-05T04:38:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	(gparted live cd can do this)
2012-06-05T04:38:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	(and you can always re-inject the xp mbr bootcode with paragon rescue kit or the xp installer cd)
2012-06-05T04:39:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	so shrink xp's partition to 20 gig, and create a 19gig + 1 gig swap..
2012-06-05T04:40:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	i'm not stopping you.. do whatever you want
2012-06-05T04:42:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	for the record, laptops are more problematic than desktops..
2012-06-05T04:42:00.000Z	jagginess	jedieaston	but its your laptop so wipe out xp if you want..
