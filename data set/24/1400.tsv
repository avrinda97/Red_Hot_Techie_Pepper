2010-02-05T09:03:00.000Z	Vadimanri		Hello room
2010-02-05T09:05:00.000Z	Vadimanri		I asked this question but couldn't get an answer, so I figured I would try again tonight......I am trying to Visual Effects to "Extra" but it errors out and I get "The Composite extension is not available"
2010-02-05T09:05:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	do you know what graphics card you have?
2010-02-05T09:06:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I have a Geforce 9800 GX2
2010-02-05T09:08:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I am not sure, it seems to be working OK, I have dual monitors setup and that is working fine
2010-02-05T09:08:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	Ah i see, i see that in Ubuntu's documentation your card is fully supported, do you have Compiz installed? (to your knowledge)
2010-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I have no idea.....I am new to linux and am fumbling my way through it
2010-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	ok no worries, go into Terminal, do you know how?
2010-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	yep I can get a term open
2010-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	ok, type in "sudo apt-get install compiz" and see what that tells you
2010-02-05T09:11:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I get a message saying "compiz is already the newest version."
2010-02-05T09:20:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	install "xgl-server" and log out, log back in, and see how that works
2010-02-05T09:22:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	do this in terminal: "sudo apt-get install xgl-server"
2010-02-05T09:23:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/369297/
2010-02-05T09:25:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	do this "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-96"
2010-02-05T09:27:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/369301/
2010-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I am assuming I should be rebooting?
2010-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	ok...be back
2010-02-05T09:35:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	It restarted in low graphics mode
2010-02-05T09:36:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	do you know how to go into safe mode?
2010-02-05T09:37:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	yes, but should I just reactivate the ubuntu nvidia driver?
2010-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I ended up activating the hardware drivers in Ubuntu, I kept loading in low graphics
2010-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	krysis	Vadimanri	boot into safe mode and do "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2010-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	Vadimanri	krysis	I will be back
