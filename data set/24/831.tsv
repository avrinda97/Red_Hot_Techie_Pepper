2011-05-01T08:57:00.000Z	vultraz		new GRUB seems to send signal to the numlock key to turn it on at boot
2011-05-01T08:57:00.000Z	vultraz		so it's hard to enter a password
2011-05-01T08:57:00.000Z	vultraz		on a laptop keybpard
2011-05-01T08:58:00.000Z	vultraz		because most keys get locked
2011-05-01T08:59:00.000Z	vultraz		also sometimes it turns on mute and I have to shutdown and turnon
2011-05-01T08:59:00.000Z	vultraz		turn on*
2011-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	vultraz		also yesterday at boot Unity disappeared and I got the non-unity 10.10 interface
2011-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	vultraz		why is natty so buggy?
2011-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	because it was just released
2011-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	vultraz		:P
2011-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	if you want stable your best bet is 10.04.02
2011-05-01T09:02:00.000Z	vultraz		;)
2011-05-01T09:02:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	10.04 is stable. 11.04 is not devel.
2011-05-01T09:02:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	long story short I don't care if you like 10.04 or not. You asked for stable
2011-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	and if you like the dev version then expect it to be unstable
2011-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	vultraz		Guest29994; lol
2011-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	jetole		11.04 is a final release / not a dev version but it's also very new. It has passed beta and all the RC but I bet in the next 18 months of it's life it will receive thousands of patches
2011-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	vultraz	jetole	I think so too
2011-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	so now you know why it's not "stable"
2011-05-01T09:05:00.000Z	vultraz	jetole	ya
2011-05-01T09:05:00.000Z	vultraz	jetole	we'll probably have 11.10 before 11.04 is really stable
2011-05-01T09:05:00.000Z	vultraz		anyway I don't mind it has nice interface
2011-05-01T09:06:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	I run 10.04 on all of the servers I manage, on my home desktop and on my laptop and am running, as of 20 minutes ago 11.04 on my office workstation. 10.04 is pretty damned good IMHO and only a idiot would run 10.10, 11.04 or 11.10 on a server
2011-05-01T09:06:00.000Z	jetole	vultraz	10.04 is LTS or long term support release which comes out every two years and is designed to be stable from the ground up. The downside is it doesn't always have the latest software
