2011-06-09T05:53:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	the nvidia should not get automatically installed just available in additional hardware drivers
2011-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	it won't
2011-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	it won't what?
2011-06-09T05:56:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	it will not upgrade the driver
2011-06-09T05:56:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	but it did upgrade the driver on a computer at work (doing a general upgrade of everything)
2011-06-09T05:57:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	need to blacklist "nvidia" somehow ... before it gets installed, to prevent it from being installed
2011-06-09T05:57:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	only if nvidia is in use in the first place
2011-06-09T05:58:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	I suspect the driver switched because something else switched dependency, previously depended on nouveau, and now depends on nvidia
2011-06-09T05:58:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	thing is, if nvidia gets in there, I'm hosed and have to re-install
2011-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	if you wish to blacklist it do so
2011-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	how is that done?  is it just a deselect?  (i thought that could only be done if it has already been selected)
2011-06-09T06:01:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	the blacklist file is in /etc/modbrobe.d
2011-06-09T06:01:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	the blacklist file is in /etc/modbprobe.d
2011-06-09T06:02:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	that just blacklists loading the module ... I wanted to blacklist the package ... but, OK, I'll try just blacklisting the module
2011-06-09T06:04:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	BTW, the 11.04 installer has a number of problems that are new since after 10.10 ... do I need to file separate bug reports on each?  And is there any hope of getting a fixed ISO before 11.10?
2011-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	you can use ubuntu minimal and install what you want
2011-06-09T06:27:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	well, at least for 11.04, I clearly need to do installs offline
2011-06-09T06:30:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	I realy don't buy your assertion that updates wiil change nouveau to nvidia that must be a bug
2011-06-09T06:31:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	well it did happen on one guy's 2nd desktop at work ... and happened just yesterday, too
2011-06-09T06:32:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	and it happened during the install I did at home this evening, when I installed WITH a network connection ... it upgraded automatically during install (and I didn't check the box) and I got the bad driver
2011-06-09T06:32:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	redid it w/o network, got the good driver
2011-06-09T06:33:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	so it seems to be a very recent update
2011-06-09T06:34:00.000Z	robin0800	Skaperen	raise a bug because it broke your system
2011-06-09T06:35:00.000Z	Skaperen	robin0800	yeah, I apparently need to ... just gathering more info so far
