2007-01-03T13:56:00.000Z	mitrovarr		A pity games don't work better on Linux.  It's really the only thing tying me to windows.  It'd be nice if they worked on macs too.
2007-01-03T13:57:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- You'll be happy to know that I've been able to run any of my Windows games (including intense 3d) without a problem in Linux ;)
2007-01-03T13:57:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 Some games have native ports, but believe me, I've had nothing but misery trying to run stuff in wine and cedega
2007-01-03T13:58:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- ahh, I use Wine right now... haven't had a problem.  Been using Linux for over a week now and see no reason whatsoever to go back to Windows...
2007-01-03T13:59:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- even my computer illiterate family has migrated to Linux with absolute ease (of course, I sweat and toiled to get it working right for them)
2007-01-03T13:59:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 No doubt.  It depends on what you want to run, I think.
2007-01-03T13:59:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 I did migrate my mother to Linux.  Linux is easy to use, it's just much harder for people at the 'just enough knowledge to be dangerous' stage; it's harder to install third-party programs, hardware, etc.
2007-01-03T14:01:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 I wish they'd make a synaptic-like program for third-party software, so it'd be easy for companies to sell commercial software for linux; a lot of stuff will probably never have good OSS equivilents, like greeting card software, etc. that no one wants to code.
2007-01-03T14:01:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- they don't need greeting card software.  use Scribus ;)
2007-01-03T14:02:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 Well, that was just an example
2007-01-03T14:02:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- aside from games, I've been able to find a native linux app for everything I used in Windows... EVERYTHING.
2007-01-03T14:04:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 Yeah, but there's some things that don't have equivilent programs.  Photoshop, and desktop publishing software, is the best example; GIMP is nowhere near that level, and I don't know of any wysiwyg desktop publishing software that is remotely competitive.
2007-01-03T14:04:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- what DTP do you use in Windows?
2007-01-03T14:04:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 I don't use anything anymore, but when I did, it was Quark.
2007-01-03T14:04:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	- hmm... the only thing I ever used in Windows was MS Pub...
2007-01-03T14:05:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 MS Pub was not considered even up to the level of other commercial windows DTPs when I worked in that field, and I don't know of any OSS equivilent to that, even.
2007-01-03T14:05:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	yeah, I wasn't exactly using it for professional reasons.  But I've heard Scribus is quite good.
2007-01-03T14:06:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	as far as Photoshop goes, apparently Gimp is getting closer to that level all the time.  And with GimpShop (something I'm struggling to install) it supposedly mimicks the PhotoShop environment pretty well.
2007-01-03T14:06:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 I'll check it out.  I would LIKE to discover an OSS DTP that was worthwhile, I just haven't.
2007-01-03T14:07:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 No, it doesn't.  The interface, even with gimpshop, makes me want to drive an icepick into my temple.
2007-01-03T14:07:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	well, that would be unfortunate ;)
2007-01-03T14:07:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 the GIMP interface is utterly humiliated even by something like Paint Shop Pro.  It's just terrible.
2007-01-03T14:08:00.000Z	elyon	mitrovarr	I'll be honest, though.  Using The Gimp drives me nuts too because that whole multiple window interface is the stupid fricken thing I've ever heard of.
2007-01-03T14:08:00.000Z	mitrovarr	elyon	 That's the most obvious and egregious problem, but there's a lot else wrong with it too.
