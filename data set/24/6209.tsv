2005-12-28T06:12:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	multiple cards isn't a problem. What two cards?
2005-12-28T06:13:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	it's not very easy to find out how I can find switch active soundcard.
2005-12-28T06:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	are you using GNOME?
2005-12-28T06:14:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	no
2005-12-28T06:14:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	running kde
2005-12-28T06:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	man set-default-soundcard
2005-12-28T06:14:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	I know that by now.
2005-12-28T06:15:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	But it was tough to dig this out :)
2005-12-28T06:15:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	that's because KDE hasn't hooked into it yet, unlike GNOME.
2005-12-28T06:16:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	strange is that cd playing works but no other sounds come out. Problems with aRts? alsa? alsamixer seems to work with volume levels without problems. Still my computer stands still :-/
2005-12-28T06:16:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	What the hell?
2005-12-28T06:16:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	It is issue of alsa, isn't it?
2005-12-28T06:17:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	no, it's not.
2005-12-28T06:17:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	If alsa works with soundcard correctly aRts should do that as well.
2005-12-28T06:17:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	so what can help? Changing audio device manually?
2005-12-28T06:17:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	is your cd player app configured to use analog or digital extraction?
2005-12-28T06:18:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	of course it's the analog way :)
2005-12-28T06:18:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	this is the reason it works I suppose.
2005-12-28T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	so aplay doesn't give you anything at all?
2005-12-28T06:19:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	apparently it does ;)
2005-12-28T06:20:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	it seems that problem is close to resolution and I haven't noticed.
2005-12-28T06:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	jaro	cat /proc/asound/cards
2005-12-28T06:21:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	I've disabled the build-in soundcard so the problem with two s.cards is over.
2005-12-28T06:21:00.000Z	jaro	crimsun_	alsa works. (I haven't noticed though :))
