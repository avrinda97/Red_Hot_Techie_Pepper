2009-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	going on a limp here, have you tried doing ifup eth0?
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	no, but I did /etc/init.d/networking restart - is that similar?
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	 do ifconfig eth0 (or whatever your using)
2009-10-22T11:51:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	make sure you have a valid ip address
2009-10-22T11:52:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	ip address looked ok.
2009-10-22T11:52:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	anyway when I did /etc/init.d/networking restart, it showed it talking to dhcp server and getting the ip address, i'd figure it would show the error there if it was not getting the ip address
2009-10-22T11:53:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	can you ping your router?
2009-10-22T11:53:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	I can ping the gateway, yup. and even the first ip past it (that traceroute shows). but pinging the second one times out, same as traceroute.
2009-10-22T11:55:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	you can try some telnet stuff to, to see what responses if any, you're getting
2009-10-22T11:56:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	yeah tried telnetting and ssh'ing to both those ip's, neither gave me any response, don't think they have those ports open
2009-10-22T11:56:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	is this box hard wired? you mentioned you had a mac, is that also hard wired?
2009-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	yup, both were hardwired
2009-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	have you tried swapping ethernets? to see if the mac has any issues with that line?
2009-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	yeah, I tried plugging both machines into the same wall jack, same result
2009-10-22T12:00:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	last question, because I'm stumped otherwise, have you made sure that there are no special rules on the router blocking traffic? I know some routers do that, esp. for companies...
2009-10-22T12:01:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	don't really have access to the router directly. do you think it's possible to have a rule that blocks all traffic that's originating from non-windows/mac machines? I guess that would explain it, but I thought traffic blocking would be more protocol-level, not originating-machine-os level filtering
2009-10-22T12:01:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	not to that extent, but for machines they don't recognize maybe
2009-10-22T12:02:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	mac address filtering or something, maybe
2009-10-22T12:03:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	true, but still I don't understand why my mac would work then... its mac address is not known on that network either
2009-10-22T12:03:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	if it's an office computer, it would have to be, but I'm not saying that's the exact issue, but it could be something related...
2009-10-22T12:04:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	no, both machines are mine... that's why it's driving me nuts
2009-10-22T12:04:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	oh, then find your network admin and punch him in the face until it works. :p
2009-10-22T12:04:00.000Z	codeFiend	rublind	I'm down with that plan :)
2009-10-22T12:06:00.000Z	rublind	codeFiend	no worries, sorry for not having a solution, but good luck! :)
