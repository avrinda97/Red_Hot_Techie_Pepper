2009-10-02T01:36:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	sudo apt-get install htop && htop                                , then check whoch process eats it up
2009-10-02T01:38:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	its firefox
2009-10-02T01:40:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	so you have the cache in background, try to delete history (formerly delete private data), restart it after : sudo killall firefox ;; which version ff do you use ?
2009-10-02T01:40:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	 if I use firefox or opera its the same result...........
2009-10-02T01:40:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	firefox 3.0.14
2009-10-02T01:45:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	but it happens with opera too
2009-10-02T01:46:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	your specs ? how much ram all ?
2009-10-02T01:50:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	do you need it to be less ? you could put their priority down (see man nice), but over a gig for ff is really too much,  also you can set down the reload in background of ff, that will save memory, but that amount is really strange, any apps combined? apparmor or something ?
2009-10-02T01:56:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	I dont think so
2009-10-02T01:57:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	I trying to figure it out do you think I could have a bad ram mod?
2009-10-02T01:58:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	i have no specific idea, ram can be checked by memtest, other issues look through the files in /var/log  (syslog,kernelog, )  and look at dmesg.txt after doing  a  dmesg > dmesg.txt
2009-10-02T03:32:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	im back my mobo takes both ddr1 and ddr2 so I changed out the ddr2 with some ddr1 and now the cache is low and ram usage low........... so might be bad ram mods?
2009-10-02T03:33:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	could be, have a ubuntu-desktop cd ?
2009-10-02T03:33:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	I ran the mem check and it said 30% pass but with no errors
2009-10-02T03:36:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	does 30% pass mean it only passed at a 30% level?
2009-10-02T03:37:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	a whole memtest takes hours, if it stopped at 30% you got a problem there, and mostly also can see errors then, memtest is something you can run over night, though most faults detect earlier, view /var/log/syslog for issues
2009-10-02T03:37:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	 ok
2009-10-02T04:50:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	I put the ddr2 back in and the cache is at 73% when it was at 20% with the ddr1.............. I suppose its a bad thing to have the cache max like that?
2009-10-02T04:51:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	seems a hardware issue
2009-10-02T05:03:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	but is it a necessarily bad event when there is a lot in cache? I am running ubuntu 64 bit
2009-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	not until you get performance issues
2009-10-02T05:11:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	DasEi	I think my vid car borrows from the on board ram and the vid card is suppose to be ddr1 and I have ddr2 installed but I thought it would just clock down for the vid card board (reading mobo and vid card user guilds now)  =_=
2009-10-02T05:13:00.000Z	DasEi	U-b-u-n-t-u	the graphics won't clock fsb down, and shared ram takes from whatever type you installed and whatever you told bios to share
