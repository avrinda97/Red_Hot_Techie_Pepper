2006-11-06T16:54:00.000Z	gpa		dont have permissions
2006-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	gpa		right now im trying to install .bin and .tar.gz
2006-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	gpa		things like java

2006-11-06T16:57:00.000Z	gpa		what if the programs I need arent in package manager, plus I dont know how to use the package manager :/
2006-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	get to know the package manager. It is what makes ubuntu so special. Just about every program you need is in there.
2006-11-06T17:00:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	the system is set up to prevent you from breaking it by accident
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	using 'sudo' allows you to break it on purpose ;)
2006-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	you can make "folders" in your home directory
2006-11-07T17:03:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	just right-click and "create folder"
2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	you are in your home directory?
2006-11-07T17:04:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	oh, you are wanting to write to a windows partition?
2006-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	there are similarities, but the overall concept is different
2006-11-07T17:06:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	it depends. A .bin file can be _anything_
2006-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	i'm not familiar with that package, but would suspect you could "install" it locally. You are aware that .tar.gz files are similar to .zip files on windows?
2006-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	you need to extract them to access the files they contain
2006-11-07T17:09:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	why not create a new folder in your home directory, and drag it there
2006-11-07T17:10:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	many small programs can be installed under your home directory for your own use.
2006-11-07T17:12:00.000Z	mcphail	gpa	there may be a README file somewhere to click on to see how to run it
