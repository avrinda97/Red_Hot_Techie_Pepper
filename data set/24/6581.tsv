2005-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	bob2		dudes, this cedega crap is off-topic
2005-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	bob2		no more
2005-09-16T06:53:00.000Z	bob2		probably because "win64" is not a useful name of anything
2005-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	Any ideas on this VNC issue?
2005-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	/var/log?
2005-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	when I try to VNC from a Fedora box to this an Ubuntu box I get the following: Error: Cant open display
2005-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	ok
2005-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	Is there somewhere, where I have to specify a session for it to use like, 'startkde', whats the equivalent for gnome?
2005-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	don't know, and gnome-session
2005-10-31T06:36:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	where "dvd backup" = "descrypt commercial dvds and copy them"?
2005-10-31T06:38:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	No as in backup personal cam, footage, tv-ad DVD footage (Work) & purchased DVD that I wish to backup
2005-10-31T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	then just copy it with k3b or whatever
2005-10-31T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	or even dd
2005-10-31T06:40:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	 I dont want to copy from DVD to DVD, I want to backup on HD, in event I ever have to burn to DVD - K3B do this?
2005-10-31T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	dd can even do that
2005-11-06T06:37:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	that sounds like firstarter being crap
2005-11-06T06:37:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	when a machine connects to some port on another machine, it picks a random (high) port on the local machine to connect from
2005-11-06T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	I suspect firstarter is looking up these source ports in /etc/services (which is a list of destination ports)
2005-11-06T06:41:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	So its nothing to worry about?
2005-11-06T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	I'd think so
2005-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	dont get you, should i just forget about it?
2005-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	unless you have another reeason to worry
2005-11-06T06:44:00.000Z	Bluemat	bob2	Your thoughts on Firestarter setup, outbound is permissive by default, this is the only way really..what you think?
2005-11-06T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	Bluemat	that's fine for a desktop, assuming firestarter is doing what it claims to
