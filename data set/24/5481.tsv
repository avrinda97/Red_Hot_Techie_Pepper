2006-06-26T06:04:00.000Z	uwe		hello, i know the question is a primitive one, but i really have no clue why this happens, ive installed Ununtu dapper amd64 on a xeon machine with a 2.4 Ghz processor , scsi RAID and 2 GB ram ... the system is very slow ... it boots very slowly, grub is slow, and even executing the commands takes too much time ! i suspect its an i/o issue on the HD ... any ideas?
2006-06-26T06:06:00.000Z	uwe		sry, a 3.20
2006-06-26T06:06:00.000Z	uwe		Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.20GHz
2006-06-26T06:06:00.000Z	matze	uwe	do you have the problems with other OSes too?
2006-06-26T06:07:00.000Z	uwe		well, matze , i had a suse on it before and it was ok
2006-06-26T06:08:00.000Z	uwe	matze	the raid configureation changed, and i very much suspect that it could be it. but how can i make sure
2006-06-26T06:08:00.000Z	matze		hmm... what architecture was suse? x86_64 or i386?
2006-06-26T06:08:00.000Z	uwe		64
2006-06-26T06:08:00.000Z	uwe		AFAIK, it broke ... :)
2006-06-26T06:09:00.000Z	matze		I guess it's any problem with dapper, but this can have many reasons imho
2006-06-26T06:10:00.000Z	uwe	matze	i didnt understad that, do you think its a dapper issue or a non-dapper issue ?
2006-06-26T06:11:00.000Z	matze		i think its a dapper issue
2006-06-26T06:11:00.000Z	matze		another question, uwe: are you running from live-cd or did you install dapper?
2006-06-26T06:12:00.000Z	uwe	matze	:) installed :)
2006-06-26T06:12:00.000Z	matze		when running from live-cd it was very, very slow on my box
2006-06-26T06:12:00.000Z	matze		ah k
2006-06-26T06:13:00.000Z	uwe		is there a way to test the I/O speed
2006-06-26T06:13:00.000Z	matze		but I dont know what the reason could be, im not a tech or something, im just using gnu/linux
2006-06-26T06:14:00.000Z	uwe		yes, same here matze .. thank you :)
2006-06-26T06:15:00.000Z	matze		no problem. tried to reinstall?
2006-06-26T06:16:00.000Z	uwe		thanks neutrinomass
2006-06-26T06:18:00.000Z	uwe		10 MB in  4.01 seconds =   2.49 MB/sec ! i suppose thats VERY slow ... no ?
2006-06-26T06:18:00.000Z	uwe		hmmm
2006-06-26T06:19:00.000Z	matze	uwe	did you install chipset drivers?
