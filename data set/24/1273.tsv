2010-04-13T22:07:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	How long have you waited? Is there hard drive activity?
2010-04-13T22:08:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	the HD led is flashing every 5 to 10 sec
2010-04-13T22:08:00.000Z	Jadoza		gavilaso I'd wait for 30 minutes and see what happens. Is it 10.04?
2010-04-13T22:09:00.000Z	Gavilaso		Jodaza i'm have wait for around 15min already
2010-04-13T22:09:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	I'm not sure, but when I created my standard account, ubuntu wrote zeroes to my entire home folder iirc. It took a loooong while
2010-04-13T22:10:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	it is 9.10 the one on their site
2010-04-13T22:10:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	But I'm rreally guessing here
2010-04-13T22:10:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	ok... i'm new to linux sooo
2010-04-13T22:11:00.000Z	Gavilaso		Jodaza for me it is weired that whe you create a new account and reboot the pc you don't see the login screen it is just in black
2010-04-13T22:11:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	You reboot? Not just log out?
2010-04-13T22:12:00.000Z	Gavilaso		now i just log out.. but early this morning i reboot and because it didn't work i re-install ubutu
2010-04-13T22:12:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	now i just log out.. but early this morning i reboot and because it didn't work i re-install ubutu
2010-04-13T22:13:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	And it's still the same with the new installation?
2010-04-13T22:13:00.000Z	Gavilaso		yes
2010-04-13T22:13:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	That sucks :) Is there _really_ a need for more than one account?
2010-04-13T22:13:00.000Z	Gavilaso		it work fine wite the user i create when installed.. but after i create a new user it just give me the black square where you are suppous to see the users list
2010-04-13T22:14:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	yes because i'm creating a guest account
2010-04-13T22:14:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	with just access to web browser and chat
2010-04-13T22:14:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	Have you tried pushing the buttons as usual? Perhaps it's just the graphics that's not showing, but if you hit enter and then the password it works?
2010-04-13T22:14:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	YUP!
2010-04-13T22:15:00.000Z	Jadoza	Gavilaso	Well, I'm giving up :) good luck finding someone who can give you more advise :)
2010-04-13T22:15:00.000Z	Gavilaso	Jadoza	thanks for your time!!
