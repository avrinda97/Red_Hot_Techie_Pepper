2005-02-05T13:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	In a file manager, navigate there.
2005-11-07T14:23:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	Look at the previous lines to that.
2005-11-07T14:24:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	it says: "dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/.. (etc).deb (-unpack):
2005-11-07T14:24:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	Can you paste (to paste.ubuntulinux.nl) the whole terminal conversation?
2005-11-07T14:25:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	sure, but it's a little nonstandard, I think I'm missing a command that the pre-install script is trying to use
2005-11-07T14:25:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	Let's see it!
2005-11-07T14:28:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	sorry for the dealy.. trying to figure out how to auto select yes so I can use >

2005-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	Why on *earth* are you installng libc6?
2005-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	I knew you were going to ask that :)
2005-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	I knew you were going to know I was going to ask. :)
2005-11-07T14:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	It printed this message:
2005-11-07T14:34:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	I'm building a system from scratch for my laptop (UMSDOS kernel).  I gutted out an old distro, put on a new kernel, got networking going and am not trying to go legit with apt-get
2005-11-07T14:34:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	so basically I'm trying to get a real libc6 to be able to install other packages
2005-11-07T14:34:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=945 , fwiw
2005-11-07T14:35:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	You should use dpkg --force to get libc6 and dpkg installed.
2005-11-07T14:36:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	thanks :)
2005-11-07T14:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	"Thank me when it works.".
2005-11-07T14:39:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	--force-all wasn't enough.. you sure there isn't a way to see what the pre-install script contains?
2005-11-07T14:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	There is.
2005-11-07T14:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	But you should just debootstrap.
2005-11-07T15:02:00.000Z	calamari	paulproteus	tricked it by creating a dpkg wrapper shell script.. it was dying on dpkg --assert-support-depends :)
2005-11-07T15:02:00.000Z	paulproteus	calamari	Heh.
