2010-04-16T11:55:00.000Z	peter_curry		Hello.  Does anyone know why my ClamTK Virus Scanner 4.15-1 scanner STALLS while scanning - and how to fix the problem?
2010-04-16T11:57:00.000Z	peter_curry		Does anyone have answer to my question?
2010-04-16T11:58:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	tried running it from terminal to get error output?
2010-04-16T11:58:00.000Z	peter_curry		No - let's try that ...  what do I enter in terminal to run it again?
2010-04-16T11:59:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	what do I enter in as a command in terminal to run the virus scanner?
2010-04-16T11:59:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	I don't use it - try doing   clam   and hitting the tab button
2010-04-16T12:02:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	OK - that worked.  It pumped two other command options.  I entered in "clamscan".  However, how do I get more specific with this command in order to run the virus scanner on my entire file system?
2010-04-16T12:02:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	I don't use it - try the man page
2010-04-16T12:03:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	the "main page" ???
2010-04-16T12:03:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	e.g   man clamscan
2010-04-16T12:04:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	e.g   man clamscan   in terminal
2010-04-16T12:06:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	OK.  I see.  So under "Synopsis" it shows "clamscan [options] [file/directory/-].  How would I adapt this command then so that I can scan my entire file system?
2010-04-16T12:07:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	I would assume   clamscan /  since / is the whole filesystem
2010-04-16T12:10:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	OK - I think it's working ...
2010-04-16T12:11:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	luck :)
2010-04-16T12:14:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	I guess I could just get used to running it through terminal this way.  I need to learn how to update the virus signatures.  I also like to do pretty thorough scans by having "Scan hidden", "Thorough", "Recursive", "Ignore size", and "Save a log" all checked in the GUI version.  The GUI still shouldn't freeze up like that.  Do I need to completely remove the program and reinstall for it not to freeze like that
2010-04-16T12:14:00.000Z	peter_curry		anymore when scanning?
2010-04-16T12:15:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	the man page might have an option for verbose - try to find the error with that
2010-04-16T12:17:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	actually, "be verbose" (-v) is an option.  What does that mean?
2010-04-16T12:18:00.000Z	moetunes		peter_ it tells more about what is happenning - there should be a way to start the gui from terminal with that option
2010-04-16T12:18:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	 it tells more about what is happenning - there should be a way to start the gui from terminal with that option
2010-04-16T12:23:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	-v doesn't do much but scan one directory when I enter "clamscan -v /"  How do I update the virus signatures via terminal?
2010-04-16T12:25:00.000Z	moetunes	peter_curry	I wouldn't know - I said I don't use it - there might be a howto on their homepage
2010-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	peter_curry	moetunes	 OK - I'm sure I'll figure it by plunking around on Google.  Thanks for your help !!!
