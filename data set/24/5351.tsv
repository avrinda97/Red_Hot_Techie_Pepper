2006-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	iter		ext3
2006-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	iter		yes
2006-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	iter		omg a windows driver for ext2
2006-11-08T07:59:00.000Z	iter		talk about scary
2006-11-08T08:00:00.000Z	LjL	iter	there are a few ones around actually
2006-11-08T08:01:00.000Z	LjL	iter	if you want to share it with linux and like to have data uncorrupted, yes it's bad
2006-11-08T08:01:00.000Z	iter	LjL	eff that
2006-11-08T08:02:00.000Z	iter	LjL	that's what smb/cifs is for
2006-11-08T08:02:00.000Z	LjL	iter	i'm sure you realize the issue with most people is dual boot...?
2006-11-08T08:03:00.000Z	LjL	iter	doesn't mean everybody does the same as you and uses computers the same way you do
2006-11-08T08:05:00.000Z	LjL	iter	the issue is that if people dual boot and want to share a filesystem, it's going to be either NTFS, FAT32 or ext3 generally. NTFS is unsafe for writing on Linux, FAT32 is a weak filesystem generally speaking, and ext3 as far as i gather is relatively safe to write on Windows
2006-11-08T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	iter	i completely agree that you should just use ext3 on linux and ntfs on windows. BUT in many cases people simply start from the assumption that they're going to have a shared partition. and FAT32 might have been around for as long as you like, but it's still as weak a filesystem as it can get
2006-11-08T08:09:00.000Z	iter	LjL	what is "weak" compared to a non-ms kernel mode driver from the oss world?
2006-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	iter	err hold on a second, what is the *Linux* ext3 driver if you a non-ms kernel mode driver from the oss world....:?
2006-11-08T08:10:00.000Z	iter	LjL	there's tons of good code in linux but as far as writing stuff for windows ?!?!
2006-11-08T08:11:00.000Z	iter	LjL	the difference being of course that there is adequate documentation for the linux kernel vs the windows kernel
2006-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	iter	LjL	he'll be back
2006-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	iter	yeah, not for long if he keeps that attitude
2006-11-21T09:24:00.000Z	iter	LjL	just curious-- what was broken with the routers that you just did +b for
2006-11-22T17:06:00.000Z	iter	LjL	know much about fonts in X ?
2006-11-22T17:06:00.000Z	iter	LjL	I have this config file that specifies a font like -*-helvetica-bold-normal-*-*-*-*-*
2006-11-22T17:07:00.000Z	iter	LjL	ideally I'd like to use it with .ttf fonts
2006-11-24T10:59:00.000Z	LjL	iter	add the line "gateway 123.123.123.123" to the appropriate entry in /etc/network/interfaces - weird gateway by the way =)
2006-11-24T10:59:00.000Z	iter	LjL	ah thanks, should've guessed
