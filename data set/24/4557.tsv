2008-01-25T19:11:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Hi ! I'm having problems with the buttons on my logitech MX510 mouse. My xorg.conf lies here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53446/
2008-01-25T19:12:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		is this correct setup?
2008-01-25T19:12:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	I would skip buttons 4 and 5 in the buttons mapping thingy since they are used for scroll
2008-01-25T19:13:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	So Buttonconfig = 1 2 3 6 7
2008-01-25T19:13:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	so will the scrollingwheel work normally then? I've pretty much tried anything
2008-01-25T19:13:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	yes, I think so.. can't really remember what I used for my logitech mouse.. apparently those settings are gone now.. don't know when they were removed
2008-01-25T19:14:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	I've pretty much followed every single guide out there ;)
2008-01-25T19:15:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	what is it that isn't working with that config?
2008-01-25T19:17:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	back and forth in Opera for instance
2008-01-25T19:17:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	I'm also unable to scroll webpages
2008-01-25T19:18:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	The buttons work, but they are not correctly mapped
2008-01-25T19:18:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	thumb-button pointing downwards scrolls the webpage down......
2008-01-25T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	that's what you can change in that line there.... I'm not sure how you can see what button you've pressed down..
2008-01-25T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	perhaps some kind of X debugging software
2008-01-25T19:20:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	I think it's something with "event"
2008-01-25T19:21:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	imwheel --config
2008-01-25T19:23:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	imwheel reports button 6 ad 7 for wheel
2008-01-25T19:23:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	and what if you put 6 7 for scroll.. doesn't that make it work?
2008-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	I've changed it to 1 2 3 6 7 now, everything else is the same
2008-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	ok
2008-01-25T19:33:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	Didn't solve my problem
2008-01-25T19:34:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	ok, hang on.. I'll see if I can find that command I used again
2008-01-25T19:34:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	Slart	upper thumb button scrolls down, lower scrolls up, mwheel goes back and forth in history
2008-01-25T19:43:00.000Z	Slart	kaktuskatta	try running "xev" in a terminal.. and press some buttons in the window that pops up
