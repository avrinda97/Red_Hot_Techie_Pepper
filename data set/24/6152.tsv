2005-12-31T13:46:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg
2005-12-31T13:47:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	that will let you redo your xorg.conf with the option to enable higher rez
2005-12-31T13:53:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	It still didn't allow me to fix my refresh rate
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	yes
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	what is ?
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	That didn't work . I used medium for the refresh range config.  There's nothing in there for 1280x1024@75 hz.  if i select 1600x1200@75 or 85 it still doesn't work
2005-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	and i have no idea what to specify under advanced as my refresh rate
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	no my monitor will do 1600x1200@60hz, it asks you to specify the max
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	when you say doesn't work   for the 1600 what exactly does  'doesnt work' mean ?
2005-12-31T15:20:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	if i specify any of the 1600x1200, regardless of what refresh i specify them at, 1280x1024 still only allows me to select 60 hz
2005-12-31T15:22:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	I dunno, and i don't know how to find my vertical and horizontal refresh rates
2005-12-31T15:23:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	you could search at    monitorworld.com   and see if they know the horizantal and vertical ranges for your monitor and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  by hand
2005-12-31T15:24:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	nope, not there
2005-12-31T15:24:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	i have a D1726T-HS
2005-12-31T15:26:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	AAMAZING ?
2005-12-31T15:35:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	i guess
2005-12-31T15:36:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	 H Freq/ V Freq:       30-85 khz / 48-150 hz
2005-12-31T15:36:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	i figured out the refresh ranges, hwinfo --monitor gave it to me
2005-12-31T15:36:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	not quite that good, 31-85 50-100
2005-12-31T15:37:00.000Z	intelikey	lws	do a 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf '   and try that i pasted. it's supposed to be for your monitor
2005-12-31T15:37:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	normally i wouldn't care about it being 60 hz. but with proper gamma it's really annoying  on MacOS X
2005-12-31T15:38:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	i have a KVM and it's really slow to switch between modes on this monitor.  So if all the computers are the same res and refresh i can swap between computers on my KVM without any flickering
2005-12-31T15:39:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	I got it working, thank you for all your help
2005-12-31T15:40:00.000Z	lws	intelikey	in the future. hwinfo --monitor works very well :)
