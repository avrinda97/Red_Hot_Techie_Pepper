2006-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	yereth		guys, I have trouble with booting the new kernel
2006-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	yereth		when I boot it, I get this:
2006-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	yereth		VFS: cannot open root device "HDA7" or unknown-block(0,0)
2006-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	yereth		please append a correct "root=" boot option
2006-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	yereth		kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
2006-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	yereth		but my old kernel, 2.6.12-10-k7, boots fine
2006-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	yereth		I installed the new kernel with apt-get and ran update-grub
2006-05-05T09:05:00.000Z	yereth		can anyone help me?
2006-05-05T09:05:00.000Z	yereth		ANYONE, please?
2006-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 so its just the new kernel that dont work?
2006-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	every new kernel I installed the last months
2006-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 now thats just odd. what do they 'fail' to do?
2006-05-05T09:06:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	in menu.lst the line is exactly the same for the old and new kernel
2006-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 the except for the change in the kernel file name. :P right?
2006-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	yes :P
2006-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	16:45 < yereth> VFS: cannot open root device "HDA7" or unknown-block(0,0)
2006-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 and your root is on hda7 ?
2006-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 what file system is your root partition ?
2006-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	ext3, in case you didn't see
2006-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 hmm odd.. could try one of the 686 kenels and see if it works there.. almost sounds like the thing is lacking the ext3 modules. but that would be real odd.
2006-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	it would be odd.. should I install from source using apt, perhaps?
2006-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 these are all issues with the *-k7 kernele?
2006-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	yereth	Dr_Willis	my 2 kernels:
2006-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yereth	 may be worth wile to post your menu.lst to pastebin. so others can look at it.
