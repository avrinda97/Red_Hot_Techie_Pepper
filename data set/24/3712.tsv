2009-10-25T02:05:00.000Z	holyguyver		Every time I try to use apt-get ot any program that uses apt get I get this Segmentation faultsts... 0%
2009-10-25T02:06:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	sounds like your apt binary may have been corrupted
2009-10-25T02:06:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	thanks, how do I fix it?
2009-10-25T02:07:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	maybe download apt-get from package.ubuntu.com then install it using "sudo dpkg -i"
2009-10-25T02:10:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	its probably called "apt"
2009-10-25T02:11:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	highlighting me works better if you highlight me instead of him
2009-10-25T02:14:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	okay I have installed it, now I shall see if that fixed it
2009-10-25T02:15:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	no that didn't work
2009-10-25T02:15:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	hrm. could be the package db thats corrup, but if that goes...youre kinda SOL
2009-10-25T02:16:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	apt would continue to not work, but i dont think itd be able to regenerate it eithe...
2009-10-25T02:18:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	& when I try to start synaptic or gdebi they just instantly crash
2009-10-25T02:18:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	no surprise there
2009-10-25T02:18:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	both apt-get and aptitude are bad right? what about apt-cache for example?
2009-10-25T02:21:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	apt-cache status Segmentation fault
2009-10-25T02:21:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	i dont think thats recoverable
2009-10-25T02:21:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	any clue what I did?
2009-10-25T02:22:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	id guess a power outage mid-update
2009-10-25T02:22:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	I haven't had a power outage.
2009-10-25T02:22:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	or laptop battery death. or sudden power off...
2009-10-25T02:23:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	I am on a desktop
2009-10-25T02:23:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	itd most likely be some situation that is a bad-for-filesystem one
2009-10-25T02:28:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	according to odinbane deleting the database does actually fix it :p
2009-10-25T02:28:00.000Z	maco	holyguyver	ok.... sure. i didnt think itd regenerate but ok
2009-10-25T02:37:00.000Z	holyguyver	maco	at least now you know how to help others with that problem in the future :D
