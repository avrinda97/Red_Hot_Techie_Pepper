2006-07-04T08:23:00.000Z	arapehl		I need some serious CDROM/CDRW mounting help from someone who really knows their stuff.... PLEASE!!!
2006-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	arapehl		Anyone?
2006-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	cd's should mount automatically.. mine do
2006-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	heh, I wish mine did.
2006-07-04T08:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	the settings to auto-mount a cd are in System -> Preferrences -> Preferred Applications
2006-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	the first tab
2006-07-04T08:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	sorry, it's in Removeable Drives and Media
2006-07-04T08:30:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	All the mount checkboxes are checked... which means there's aproblem somewhere and the drives don't mount automatically ... hence the reason why they won't mount manually either. I need to figure out what's wrong and fix it first :(
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	ahh, nice job of tracking that down on your part :)
2006-07-04T08:31:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	I haven't done too much on my own actually... ToHellWithGA has been helping me.
2006-07-04T08:35:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	do you have any experience troubleshooting cdrom/rw mounting?
2006-07-04T08:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	no, sorry, they've always just wokred for me.
2006-07-04T08:36:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	okay, well thanks anyway :)
2006-07-04T08:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	does the cd drive appear in the hardware browser?
2006-07-04T08:38:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	yep... just doesn't mount
2006-07-04T08:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	tried mounting as root?
2006-07-04T08:39:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	yeah, all it does is comes back to the prompt... no errors nothing!
2006-07-04T08:39:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	where's a log file I can check?
2006-07-04T08:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	/var/log/messages
2006-07-04T08:40:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	thanks, checking now
2006-07-04T08:41:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	/ ToHellWithGA: "Jul  3 22:31:46 desktop kernel: [55884.692313]  cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!"
2006-07-04T08:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	blank disc?
2006-07-04T08:42:00.000Z	arapehl	ardchoille	last I tried it was a commercial CD (Norton Anti-Virus in my CDRW and ATI Radeon Drivers in my CDR)
2006-07-04T08:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	arapehl	wow
