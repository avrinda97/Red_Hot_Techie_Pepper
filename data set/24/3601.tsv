2007-12-10T18:29:00.000Z	udinesh5	dooglus	lemme try
2007-12-10T18:29:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	I don't know why the GNOME programs generally don't have manual pages like everything else
2007-12-10T18:31:00.000Z	udinesh5	dooglus	yep only help options n appl options
2007-12-10T18:31:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas:no other stuff
2007-12-10T18:31:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	there's nothing under 'help options' about how to display all the options?
2007-12-10T18:32:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: yes
2007-12-10T18:32:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: no options there
2007-12-10T18:32:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	what are you looking for?
2007-12-10T18:33:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: i was looking for commandline options so tat i could specify all cd writing job jus keying in
2007-12-10T18:33:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: nothing specific other than trying to use commandline interface
2007-12-10T18:33:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	I don't think GNOME applications are supposed to be very useful - they're for newbies moving from Windows who like things to click on.  there are command line cd burning programs if that's what you're looking for
2007-12-10T18:34:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	look at 'cdrecord' for instance
2007-12-10T18:34:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: yep i am a newbie jus trying to move on to linux ! i am using ubuntu dapper
2007-12-10T18:35:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglas: sure !
2007-12-10T18:35:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	type "man cdrecord" in a terminal and it will give you more options than you want :)
2007-12-10T18:35:00.000Z	udinesh5	dooglus	thanx dude !:-)
2007-12-10T18:36:00.000Z	udinesh5		dooglus:logging off bye :-)
2007-12-10T18:36:00.000Z	dooglus	udinesh5	bye
