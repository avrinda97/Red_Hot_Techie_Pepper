2012-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	L3top	esak	look for anything that is using up a lot of cpu
2012-07-06T00:10:00.000Z	L3top	esak	thus raising your temperature, thus kicking the fan
2012-07-06T00:11:00.000Z	esak		something is using 100% of cpu l3top
2012-07-06T00:17:00.000Z	L3top	esak	what is using 100% of cpu

2012-07-06T00:19:00.000Z	L3top		that was my next question after getting the output of WHAT was eating your cpu to confirm esak. Please give me a the output of lspci -nn | grep VGA
2012-07-06T00:21:00.000Z	esak	subz3r0	someone say  heat of laptop and fan work. maybe for geraphic. i think my vga is not install correct
2012-07-06T00:23:00.000Z	L3top		that was my next question after getting the output of WHAT was eating your cpu to confirm esak. Please give me a the output of lspci -nn | grep VGA  from a terminal
2012-07-06T00:25:00.000Z	esak	subz3r0	 output of lspci -nnk | grep -i VGA -A2" is ---> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1077064/ is it install coreccet ?
2012-07-06T00:26:00.000Z	L3top	esak	that looks correct. Please give me the output of apt-cache policy fglrx | grep stall

2012-07-06T00:29:00.000Z	L3top	esak	that looks correct. You have the correct driver for your GPU installed.
2012-07-06T00:30:00.000Z	L3top	esak	again... if you could type: top          in a terminal... it will tell you WHAT processes are using HOW MUCH cpu.
2012-07-06T00:31:00.000Z	esak		l3top when i go to system setting then additional driver. see 2 line for ATI/AMD . i active one of them. do u want see it pic ?

2012-07-06T00:35:00.000Z	esak		one gedit is using 100% of cpu because im installing vga driver manule. but other time like when i open  4 or 5 tab of fire fox fan work more and have hot temperature
2012-07-06T00:36:00.000Z	esak		l3top  one gedit is using 100% of cpu because im installing vga driver manule. but other time like when i open  4 or 5 tab of fire fox fan work more and have hot temperature
