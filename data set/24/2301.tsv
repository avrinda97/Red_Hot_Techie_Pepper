2009-02-06T22:19:00.000Z	indian_munnda		can anyone tell me is there any application available in ubuntu like teamviewer, through which i can use a remote machine and do tasks????
2009-02-06T22:21:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	More than what's available in the Remote Desktop Viewer in Applications / Internet?
2009-02-06T22:22:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	Or Terminal Server Client (same place) - They were installed by default on my Ubuntu install.
2009-02-06T23:21:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	Yup. Some vnc servers even serve a java applet vnc client if you want.
2009-02-06T23:22:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	There's probably one installed already, it's just not called vncviewer.
2009-02-06T23:22:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	See for example Terminal Services Client
2009-02-06T23:23:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	sorry, Terminal Server Client.
2009-02-06T23:23:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	i think that is rdesktop or tsclient? right?
2009-02-06T23:23:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	It does VNC protocol, and (at least for me) it was installed in the default Ubuntu installation
2009-02-06T23:24:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	Yeah, tsclient
2009-02-06T23:25:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	If you start terminal server client, there's a choice for protocol, you can choose VNC.
2009-02-06T23:25:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	but which protocol should i use for windows remotee desktop
2009-02-06T23:25:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	RDP
2009-02-06T23:25:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	ok
2009-02-06T23:26:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	rdpv5 or just rdp?
2009-02-06T23:28:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	That I don't know.
2009-02-06T23:28:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	I think it depends on the version of the server on the other end.
2009-02-06T23:28:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	Ah, if you hover over the choices... it says
2009-02-06T23:29:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	RDPv5 for connecting to XP or newer, RDP for 2000 and before.
2009-02-06T23:30:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	thanx
2009-02-06T23:33:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	dude on more question, what if the user doent have password
2009-02-06T23:35:00.000Z	ramirand_	indian_munnda	Hmmm. Don't think I've tried RDP w/o a password. Does it not let you leave it blank?
2009-02-06T23:35:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	haven't tried yet
2009-02-06T23:36:00.000Z	indian_munnda	ramirand_	actually my frnd is etting up his XP yet
