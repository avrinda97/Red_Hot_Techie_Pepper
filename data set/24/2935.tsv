2008-06-18T22:07:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	NTFS-3G does support Vista created partitions
2008-06-18T22:07:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	is it r/w
2008-06-18T22:08:00.000Z	yjwong		Yes, r/w by default
2008-06-18T22:08:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	awsome,thanks.  Now i just gotta find out why its is erroring
2008-06-18T22:08:00.000Z	yjwong		XycoyiX: Unless there's an error with the disk, which requires you to do a Disk Check in Windows
2008-06-18T22:08:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	lol, what if I got rid of windows?
2008-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	yjwong		Oh noes. You can force mount the disk, but it is generally not recommended.
2008-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	there is no way to spoff a diskcheck?
2008-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	spoof
2008-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	there is fsck.ntfs, but that works for only Windows XP and older NTFS volumes.
2008-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	yjwong		To force mount your disk, open a Terminal
2008-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	  sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/sda1 -o force
2008-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	then use "sudo mount /dev/<volume name> -o force
2008-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	yjwong		Oh, that command is correct too, but mine's shorter (:
2008-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	I believe it's a laptop drive right?
2008-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	yes it is
2008-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	XycotiX		its a partition
2008-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	XycotiX		I am trying to rescue files off it
2008-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	yjwong		Oh, a much safer alternative is to take out the drive, then put it into an external casing, then use some other Windows computer to check the disk.
2008-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	if you do have the Vista install DVD, I believe there's an option for you to check the disk
2008-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	oh, didn't think of that
2008-06-18T22:12:00.000Z	XycotiX	yjwong	Ill look into that, thanks
2008-06-18T22:13:00.000Z	yjwong	XycotiX	no problem (:
