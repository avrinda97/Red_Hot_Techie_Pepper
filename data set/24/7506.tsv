2004-11-06T10:00:00.000Z	WW	izaac	Get it from marillat
2004-11-06T10:01:00.000Z	izaac	WW	ok let me check
2004-11-06T10:02:00.000Z	izaac	WW	nerim is a marillat mirror :| 
2004-11-06T11:28:00.000Z	WW	izaac	Could be...
2004-11-06T11:33:00.000Z	izaac	WW	it isn't 100% sure to work in all cases
2004-11-06T11:34:00.000Z	WW	izaac	You mean using the maximum speed isn't sure to work?
2004-11-06T11:34:00.000Z	izaac	WW	no i mean the process of burning a cd simple going and right click on a image
2004-11-06T11:35:00.000Z	WW	izaac	But doesn't that just run nautilus-cd-burner?  So nautilus-cd-burner isn't gauranteed to work???
2004-11-06T11:35:00.000Z	WW	izaac	... say it ain't so!
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	izaac	WW	i think so, cause nautilus cdburner not guarantee you to burn properly a DVD image for example
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	WW	izaac	If that is true, the option should be disable! Or simply removed!
2004-11-06T11:37:00.000Z	izaac	WW	i though the name says so.. cause is nautilus-_CD_-burner
2004-11-06T11:37:00.000Z	WW	izaac	?
2004-11-06T11:39:00.000Z	izaac	WW	sorry if i dont explain myself clearly cause i dont speak english so good
2004-11-06T11:39:00.000Z	WW	izaac	I think I see what you meant... but I was burning CDs, so it should work.
2004-11-06T11:41:00.000Z	izaac	WW	well but it isn't good enough as k3b for example with a lot of options and features
