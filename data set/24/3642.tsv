2007-11-29T13:02:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Hey guys? Neither Synaptic nor Add/Remove are working for me(At least for adding). Did I screw something up on accident?
2007-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	is there any error message?
2007-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	timsandtoms		g1gaman_:Nope, it just asks me to reload the list, so I do, then I try again, and it asks to reload, etc
2007-11-29T13:05:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	have you tried to add the program by using command apt?
2007-11-29T13:05:00.000Z	timsandtoms		I also can't seem to install the Adobe SWF addon thing in firefox, seems to be the same sort of thing. It finds the addon it needs, but when I click to install, it just doesnt work
2007-11-29T13:05:00.000Z	timsandtoms		I dont even know what that is. This is my 3rd day on Ubuntu
2007-11-29T13:07:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	open terminal and type in: sudo aptitude install your_desired_program
2007-11-29T13:08:00.000Z	g1gaman_		gentlemen, where can i find the list file for 'locales'. apt doesnt dist-upgrade, sez: locales list file contains empty filename :(
2007-11-29T13:08:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Ah, ok, thanks. Is there any way to fix the Add/Remove and Synaptic though?
2007-11-29T13:09:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	i think if add/remove doesnt work, then you will not be able to install anything from terminal, but at least you will know the cause of crash
2007-11-29T13:11:00.000Z	timsandtoms		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2007-11-29T13:11:00.000Z	timsandtoms		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2007-11-29T13:13:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	dont run multiple apt programs at the same time
2007-11-29T13:14:00.000Z	timsandtoms	g1gaman_	still doesn't help, same problem
2007-11-29T13:17:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	close any program (except terminal) and type in: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-11-29T13:17:00.000Z	timsandtoms		So type "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" all in one line?
2007-11-29T13:17:00.000Z	timsandtoms		with Pidgin closed as well?
2007-11-29T13:17:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	yes.
2007-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	no, you can leave pidgin open
2007-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	timsandtoms		ok
2007-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	but any other program should be closed
2007-11-29T13:18:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Ok, did it. Now what?
2007-11-29T13:19:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Any chance my settings could have just gotten messed up and changing them will fix it?
2007-11-29T13:20:00.000Z	g1gaman_	timsandtoms	what happened when you did dist-upgrade?
