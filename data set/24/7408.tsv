2005-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	mattgirv		basically i have already added fglrx driver under the xorg.conf, (9800 pro my card is)
2005-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	mattgirv		yes
2005-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	mattgirv		FATAL: Module fglrx not found.
2005-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	mattgirv		yep
2005-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	mattgirv		what do you mean?
2005-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	mattgirv		i tried downloading it and manually compiling it
2005-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	mattgirv		it was complaining about an error, wait a sec ill tell you what it said
2005-03-23T17:03:00.000Z	mattgirv		it basically said kernel includes at /usr/src/linux/include not found or incomplete
2005-03-23T17:03:00.000Z	mattgirv		but i thought linux-386 is the kernel sources
2005-03-23T17:04:00.000Z	mattgirv		i looked at kernel-source-blahbalbhalh and my kernel version isn't there
2005-03-23T17:04:00.000Z	Seveas	mattgirv	it is linux-source
2005-03-23T17:04:00.000Z	mattgirv	Seveas	oh.. hehe :P
