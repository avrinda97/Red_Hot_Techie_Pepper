2005-11-25T17:14:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	not much different yet
2005-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	you're brave dude - and impatient ;)
2005-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	no i have breezy on my real partition
2005-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	i'm not stupid :)
2005-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	i know it will crash and not work from time to time
2005-11-25T17:16:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	yeah i keep a second PC just for putting stuff like that on - the bleeding edge is fun but not when you're on a deadline and your main machine kicks the bucket
2005-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	very true
2005-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	and differences yet (even small ones?)
2005-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	some there is a GUI for .deb installation now
2005-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	hal is not working so that's new
2005-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	nice. there's an app out there that does a graphical installation of source files - I'd like to see that in Dapper
2005-11-25T17:19:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	HAL? Who needs it anywayz?
2005-11-25T17:19:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	i know right
2005-11-25T17:20:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	you know there is a cd out now for Kubuntu Dapper testing
2005-11-25T17:21:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	it's called Flight #1
2005-11-25T17:21:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	i may check it out but i got v limited bandwidth :/
2005-11-25T17:31:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	I'm holding out a lot of hope for v1.5 - hope they don't let me down
2005-11-25T17:32:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	yeah right now in dapper there still running 1.07
2005-11-25T17:32:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xanadu	but i'm sure that 1.5 will be there in april
2005-11-25T17:32:00.000Z	Xanadu	ecobuntu	i think they just released RC3 and are finalising the last little bugs
