2010-10-01T05:47:00.000Z	redblacktree		oh, also, if I boot with monitor unplugged, and then plug the monitor in, it does not display anything
2010-10-01T05:48:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	don't use vnc for headless server use something like nomachine, freenx or x2go, they don't need a monitor plugged in to start the x-session
2010-10-01T05:51:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	that may be the best advice I've gotten yet
2010-10-01T05:51:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	will check it out
2010-10-01T05:51:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	do you have a favorite of the three?
2010-10-01T05:52:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	also, why don't I see a console if I boot without monitor, and subsequently plug a monitor in?
2010-10-01T05:54:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	have you tried switching tty screens after you've plugged the monitor in? try ctrl-alt-F1 and see if that brings up a screen
2010-10-01T05:57:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	that doesn't cause the console to appear, unfortunately. I was hopeful. :)  I am going to try to connect via ssh
2010-10-01T05:58:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	interesting let me know if ssh works, it should work
2010-10-01T05:58:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	yeah, it didn't.  Now, I'm wondering if It's booting at all
2010-10-01T05:59:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	I've heard of BIOS settings that cause it to halt when no vga is detected, but I didn't find any setting like that in mine
2010-10-01T05:59:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	if ssh is not working, then yes I would think that something else is going in and your not booting up at all
2010-10-01T06:00:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	if your not hearing any "beeps" when it boots I would not think its a bios or hardware issue
2010-10-01T06:00:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	just looking at hard drive lights and such, it seems to do *something*
2010-10-01T06:00:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	I think your going to have to plug in a monitor just to see it boot
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	yeah, I've got a monitor I can plug in
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	and it does boot when I plug it in
2010-10-01T06:01:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	I've had drives that looked like they were doing stuff and in the end they had failed!
2010-10-01T06:04:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	Do you have any idea what the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" option in /etc/default/grub does?  I'm thinking of attempting the fix here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1333717 even though that's not quite the problem I have
2010-10-01T06:05:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	no sorry grub especially grub2 is pretty mysterious to me
2010-10-01T06:05:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	no problem.  The good thing about this situation is that if I FUBAR it, I don't care.  I haven't done anything with the machine besides install Ubuntu and try to get a remote desktop to work.
2010-10-01T06:06:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	good luck :)
2010-10-01T06:07:00.000Z	redblacktree	jjgalvez__	fyi, that setting seems to have made the startup "stuff" echo to the screen.  It hadn't been doing that.
2010-10-01T06:08:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	redblacktree	good to know
