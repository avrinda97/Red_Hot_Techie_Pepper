2012-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	which vm?
2012-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	virtualbox
2012-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	you looked at setting static in the network portion of vbox setup for the vdi?
2012-04-22T05:53:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	no, i did not
2012-04-22T05:53:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	i didn't even know such a thing existed
2012-04-22T05:53:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	at this time all i see is how to set the adapter type and mac address.  am i missing something?
2012-04-22T05:54:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	pretty sure you can have it your way, it will have to be able to talk to the network, but thats another issue
2012-04-22T05:54:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	give me a sec, let me open an instance so i can tell whats what
2012-04-22T05:59:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	got it, set the virtualbox to bridged, the virtual os needs to be setup to your setting, some static ip, gateway and all that
2012-04-22T05:59:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	all done
2012-04-22T06:03:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	your static ip setup gets dns from where?
2012-04-22T06:05:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	what ip are you trying to fake? and what is the range of the normal dhcp provided range?
2012-04-22T06:06:00.000Z	StoneCypher	ReXHaviK	i'm not trying to fake anything, i just want to stuff a bunch of build tools into a vm and hand the vm off such that it can just spin up and have an ip.  the customer is non-technical and i'm automating support away.
2012-04-22T06:06:00.000Z	ReXHaviK	StoneCypher	well, i am sure the answer is out there, see ya
