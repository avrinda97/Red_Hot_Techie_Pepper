2004-12-03T06:29:00.000Z	mass		Lathiat, Chibi: my data is just fine, the thing just refuses to mount now
2004-12-03T06:30:00.000Z	mass		it has my home directory and all my music, so I'm very upset about this. 30 minutes ago was when this little machine reinstall was supposed to end for the night :(
2004-12-03T06:30:00.000Z	runixd	mass	what happened?
2004-12-03T06:30:00.000Z	mass	runixd	no idea :(
2004-12-03T06:31:00.000Z	runixd	mass	why are you upset then?
2004-12-03T06:31:00.000Z	mass	runixd	this has happened to me in the past, it was an old IDE cable
2004-12-03T06:31:00.000Z	runixd	mass	I don't follow, your hard drive went dead or smth?
2004-12-03T06:31:00.000Z	mass	runixd	no, kernel driver error is my guess
2004-12-03T06:32:00.000Z	runixd	mass	what are the symptoms?
2004-12-03T06:33:00.000Z	runixd	mass	check /etc/mtab
2004-12-03T06:34:00.000Z	mass	runixd	I removed it from fstab with no effect. Now I'm removing the scsi drivers from /etc/modules
2004-12-03T06:34:00.000Z	runixd	mass	fstab is not related, mounted drive info is in /etc/mtab
2004-12-03T06:37:00.000Z	mass	runixd	it is not a setup problem, its a kernel level software problem
2004-12-03T06:37:00.000Z	mass	runixd	the reiserfs 3 drivers are ... fragile in my experience
2004-12-03T06:38:00.000Z	runixd	mass	reiser3 is very stable, but I still don't get what the problem is :)
2004-12-03T06:39:00.000Z	mass	runixd	well I tracked it down to a driver initialization problem. If I put my scsi drivers in /etc/modules, it fails to mount. if I wait until after boot and just mount the drive, it works. Dunno if the drivers will be found if I just try a mount at boot without /etc/modules having the scsi drivers
2004-12-03T06:39:00.000Z	mass	runixd	and it is definately some bug in the reiserfs fs driver. I can do everything else, including a fsck
2004-12-03T06:43:00.000Z	runixd	mass	you should probably have your driver within kernel or load it on boot or tinker with initrd
2004-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	mass	runixd	perhaps I should try it. In the past, the driver did not work right when compiled into the kernel
2004-12-03T06:46:00.000Z	mass	runixd	it is possible that this scsi driver is not set up with an appropriate dependancy as well - after all, it is pretty new (2.6.9)
2004-12-03T06:47:00.000Z	runixd	mass	probably, don't blame reiser right away
2004-12-03T06:49:00.000Z	mass	runixd	it has just been a few times in the past, it has been reiser
2004-12-03T06:50:00.000Z	runixd	mass	that means its mounted and this message is generated by reading /etc/mtab and is not related to filesystem
2004-12-03T06:51:00.000Z	mass	runixd	it is an error returned by the reiser kernel driver, there is nothing in mtab
