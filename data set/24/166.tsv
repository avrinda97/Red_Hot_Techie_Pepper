2012-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	ankur		what's that
2012-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	it's a vi improved editor-like web browser
2012-09-15T09:32:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	lemme see
2012-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	you know shell scripting?
2012-09-15T09:33:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	sh, bash, lush, a bit of csh, lisp, perl, php
2012-09-15T09:34:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	lisp & bash mostly
2012-09-15T09:35:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	why are you using vimprobable? O.o
2012-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	i look at a lot of textual websites and am on a minimal kick right now. it's actually a really great browser, vimprobable is. much faster than any other browser i've used.
2012-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	yeah if you're reading text then it's great.
2012-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	but then when it comes to multimedia it would suck
2012-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	i really dislike how multimedia www/http has become. i miss the old days. i wanna meet with my friends on a telnet bbs or shell, not facebook. ideas, not identity.
2012-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	haha i don't think that's gonna happen.
2012-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	it will! you'll see! (i don't even believe me)
2012-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	let us hope soo. I hate multimedia taking too long to load up :P
2012-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	and 99.(loop for i from 0 to (get-universal-time) do (format t "9")% of the media is crap
2012-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	didn't understand a word :\ not much of a geek
2012-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	99.99999999% of the media that takes so long to load is crap
2012-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	hahaha true that
2012-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	do you use any of the popular web servers, like fac√©book, twiddler etc
2012-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	i use fb twitter g+
2012-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	helps me stay connected and updated
2012-09-15T09:55:00.000Z	nydel	ankur	me too, but i don't like any of them. they don't help me stay connected or updated at all. if anything they create distance between myself & friends i might make an effort to see (& vise versa) if these social bits didn't exist
2012-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	ankur	nydel	it surely makes you lazy and not get you to meet them, but then everything has it's pros and cons
