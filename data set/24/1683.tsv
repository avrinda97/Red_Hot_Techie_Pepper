2009-11-03T03:52:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	this is how i found it: "apt-cache search jdk"

2009-11-03T03:54:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	it warms my heart to press java and tab afterwards now:)
2009-11-03T03:54:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	thanks:)
2009-11-03T03:54:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	if you want eclipse as IDE, it did not work straight out of the box on 9.04, I hope they fixed this for Karmic
2009-11-03T03:55:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	not going to use eclipse
2009-11-03T03:55:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	happy coding to you :-)
2009-11-03T03:55:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	thanks:) going to use gedit
2009-11-03T03:56:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	gedit? does that have highlighting now?
2009-11-03T03:56:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	Yes it does, great...
2009-11-03T03:56:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	yes:) u can just store the file as *.java and then it will start the highlighting
2009-11-03T03:57:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	or you can choose yourself in the lower right corner
2009-11-03T03:57:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	I see it, pretty neat :-)
2009-11-03T03:58:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	thats what i thought:D also when i write in eclipse i tend to think it is kind of slow....
2009-11-03T03:59:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	 I like the method and property-completion of a regular IDE, I must be lazy ;-)
2009-11-03T03:59:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	but have you tried snippets?
2009-11-03T04:00:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	No what about them?
2009-11-03T04:02:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	lets say you want System.out.println("");, just write sout <tab> and then it will come out and the cursor in the middle of the "" and next tab will put you on the next line:)
2009-11-03T04:02:00.000Z	plitter	matreya6	 and you can easily make new ones
2009-11-03T04:04:00.000Z	matreya6	plitter	Ah, so a sort of Shorthand definitions for frequently used commands? I'll take Method- and property-completion instead.
