2005-06-16T07:02:00.000Z	david		hey
2005-06-16T07:02:00.000Z	david		does anyknow know the differences between OSS ESD and ALSA?
2005-06-16T07:02:00.000Z	crimsun	david	esd is a sound daemon that can use oss or alsa.
2005-06-16T07:07:00.000Z	david	crimsun	so when does it use either one, and what's the dif between oss and alsa?
2005-06-16T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	david	by default, in warty and hoary, esd uses alsa's oss emulation device /dev/dsp
2005-06-16T07:08:00.000Z	david	crimsun	is that alsa or oss then?
2005-06-16T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	david	it's alsa
2005-06-16T07:08:00.000Z	david	crimsun	ohh ty
2005-06-16T07:08:00.000Z	david	crimsun	should i have that selected as default output then, esd?
2005-06-16T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	david	the actual device /dev/dsp, however, is oss
2005-06-16T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	david	if you use esd, yes
2005-06-16T07:09:00.000Z	david	crimsun	oohhh
2005-06-16T07:09:00.000Z	david	crimsun	so keeping it on ESD is the way to go?
2005-06-16T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	david	for default compatibility, yes
2005-06-16T07:10:00.000Z	david	crimsun	thanks
2005-06-16T07:10:00.000Z	crimsun	david	some people get better performance with direct alsa, though
2005-06-20T07:27:00.000Z	crimsun	david	java is not in universe.
2005-06-20T07:28:00.000Z	david	crimsun	do i have to go to java site and manuall download it?
2005-06-20T07:28:00.000Z	crimsun	david	there are instructions on the wiki and in the guide
2005-06-21T09:15:00.000Z	david	crimsun	how to i boot to the shell w/o loading X
2005-06-21T09:15:00.000Z	crimsun	david	search the wiki for the correct procedure for disabling a graphical display manager
2006-03-03T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	david	you can in Dapper, but in Breezy you'll have to remove the symlinks
2006-03-03T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	david	take a look at the 'mozilla-mplayer' package in multiverse
2006-03-03T14:35:00.000Z	david	crimsun	ok, thanks :)
