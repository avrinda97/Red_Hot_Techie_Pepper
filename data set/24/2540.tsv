2011-06-02T02:41:00.000Z	clooluss		i am trying to give other users on my pc access to a subfolder in my home folder. I have created a group and put both users in it. I have changed the group permissions on the subfolder to r-x. The other user still gets "access denied" when trying to ls the folder. Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong?
2011-06-02T02:42:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	change ownership on folder to group?
2011-06-02T02:42:00.000Z	clooluss	tanath	how do I do that?
2011-06-02T02:43:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	chown user:group
2011-06-02T02:43:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	man chown
2011-06-02T02:58:00.000Z	clooluss	tanath	I have read the man chown and I really don't understand what is going. Do i want my subfolder owned by a user or a group? What is the difference? What is the significance of the username in the command chown user:group?
2011-06-02T02:58:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	files/folders are owned by both
2011-06-02T02:59:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	you should be user owner, and you should be in the group taht you give its ownership to
2011-06-02T02:59:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	the user:group specifies the files user and group ownership
2011-06-02T03:00:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	because you can set user and group permissions. as rightful owner you want to be the user owner, but you want to set group permissions so those in said group can do things
2011-06-02T03:00:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	then you add users to said group
2011-06-02T03:01:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	maybe google 'chown' for examples and explanations
2011-06-02T03:01:00.000Z	clooluss	tanath	So.... the folder is owned like this:  drwxr-x---  70 matt home    12288 2011-04-30 00:27 Photos    and both users are in the group "home" - but if log is as the other user and try to ls the folder, it says "access denied." I don't see where I've gone wrong.
2011-06-02T03:03:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	sorry your grammar is unclear from the word "log" on..
2011-06-02T03:03:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	"is as"?
2011-06-02T03:04:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	er, try making the user owner group as well
2011-06-02T03:04:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	so, chown groupname:groupname
2011-06-02T03:06:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	oh, operand. yeah, i didn't specify.. i thought you had a handle on how to use the command. you have to tell it what you want to operate on
2011-06-02T03:07:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	basically you said 'do this' and it said 'to what'?
2011-06-02T03:08:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	worth a shot :P
2011-06-02T03:09:00.000Z	clooluss	tanath	Do I need to give the other user / group access to the home folder that my Photos folder lives in?
2011-06-02T03:09:00.000Z	tanath	clooluss	no
