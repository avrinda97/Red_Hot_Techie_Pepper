2007-12-04T05:59:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	yes, whats up with it? trying to install a wireless card?
2007-12-04T06:00:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	trying to install SMCWCB-G
2007-12-04T06:02:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, i had to use ndiswrapper with my wireless card, but first i had to blacklist a driver; that is, Ubuntu was trying to load a driver that didnt work for my card, blacklisting just prevents that, and then ndiswrapper can load the windows driver
2007-12-04T06:03:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, wait just a seccond...
2007-12-04T06:04:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	ok thx

2007-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, try lsmod | grep smc and tell me what the output is
2007-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	nothing happens. perhaps i am typing wrong? i included spaces.  i also assumed in terminal. (forgive - this is my first week in linux)
2007-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	everybody has their first week in linux, you are doing great....but that just means theres no output...so...(let me think)..
2007-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, it looks like  madwifi.org works better, look: http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility/SMC theres your card
2007-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	i've been there.  see my card.  don't see how to make use of madwifi
2007-12-04T06:11:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, let me see how to install it
2007-12-04T06:11:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	thx
2007-12-04T06:11:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	well, the good thing is we know its supported :)
2007-12-04T06:12:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	right and it seems like it is already a package?
2007-12-04T06:13:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	: or installed on 7.10 cd at least
2007-12-04T06:14:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	ok, have you done sudo apt-get install madwifi-source madwifi-toll ? that will install madwifi, maybe the program has a gui you can use, i really dont know from here, ive never used madwifi
2007-12-04T06:14:00.000Z	NYCThomasB	filloy	i haven't.  type as you wrote it?
2007-12-04T06:15:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	yes, the command apt-get install install any package you type after that, there if you type apt-get install firefox it will install firefox (though you have it already) and the sudo is because you need to be super user to install :)
2007-12-04T06:16:00.000Z	filloy	NYCThomasB	I know were can you get help from now on with your madwifi issue, try channel #madwifi
