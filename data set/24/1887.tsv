2009-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	Andorin		I don't know how, but "Mute" is just NOT working. The system detects that I press the key, but it's not doing anything.
2009-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	Andorin		Somebody please advise.
2009-07-15T14:16:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	does the volume icon change when you press the button?
2009-07-15T14:17:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Nope.
2009-07-15T14:18:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	are you on a laptop? what kind?
2009-07-15T14:19:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Nope, on my PC. Though Mute stopped working on my laptop quite some time ago. PC is an HP Pavilion a6512p running Jaunty.
2009-07-15T14:20:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	sorry .. i was just interested in your problem.. didn't actually know how to fix it.. althought it might be that the kernel doesn't support the hardware (extra buttons your computer has)
2009-07-15T14:20:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	It was working earlier.
2009-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	And it doesn't work even if I set the shortcut to something like Alt+M.
2009-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	are you using the right sound mixer? accidentally switched by any chance?
2009-07-15T14:22:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	How do I check?
2009-07-15T14:23:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	you can go to the sound preferences and there are various things you can test.. and also test the volume slider controls.. because that's what your keyboard is controlling right? is it controlling MASTER?
2009-07-15T14:24:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	I can right-click the Volume icon in the panel and hit Preferences... it is indeed set to Master.
2009-07-15T14:25:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	I also can't think of anything I've done today that would change anything regarding my volume.
2009-07-15T14:25:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	okay.. does the volume slider work to change your volume?
2009-07-15T14:25:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Yup. And the Volume Up/Down keys on my keyboard work. Just not Mute.
2009-07-15T14:26:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	that's so strange.. all the keyboard commands should be controlling the same thing.. i'm assuming you set with the "keyboard shortcuts" in preferences?
2009-07-15T14:26:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	have you tried logging out and back in?
2009-07-15T14:27:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Yes, I did. The default is the Mute key and I even tried changing the shortcut. Doesn't work. No, I haven't tried logging out.
2009-07-15T14:27:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	give it a shot.. let's see what happens when GNOME reloads
2009-07-15T14:28:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	K, brb.
2009-07-15T14:32:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Still doesn't work.
2009-07-15T14:34:00.000Z	moymoy	Andorin	sorry dude, i don't know what the problem is.. since everything else seems to work fine
2009-07-15T14:35:00.000Z	Andorin	moymoy	Thanks anyway for trying; I'm going to register on the forums and post my question there.
