2007-09-09T05:59:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	it has no FileSystem on it right??
2007-09-09T05:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	that's right
2007-09-09T06:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	it's formatted and i've allocated the whole 149gb as ext3
2007-09-09T06:12:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	you might want to ask a phsycocat or just trust them and learn something *additional* in the process
2007-09-09T06:13:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	its all above my head
2007-09-09T06:14:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	mine too "this makes no sense to me because i've Got a /home partition already" yikes!
2007-09-09T06:15:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	me too... its my external hard drive i'm trying to put to use by using it as a storage device... but so far can't put anything on it...
2007-09-09T06:18:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	 what app did you use to part* and format it?
2007-09-09T06:19:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	i did it with gparted and cfdisk... same result
2007-09-09T06:24:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	 the stuff you want to know is basically at the middle of that phycocats page
2007-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	using the new partition: ?
2007-09-09T06:25:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	make that "at the bottom of the page"
2007-09-09T06:27:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	sorry, but i just don't get it.. i could follow it if it was direct, but adapting it to my different scenario...  :/
2007-09-09T06:28:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	this is how it is done in pclinuxos - go to start system then file tools then file manager super user mode then go to storage media then look for that partition then properties then permisions
2007-09-09T06:28:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	but i am in ubuntu
2007-09-09T06:29:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	lol, i am in damn small linux >just came here to learn abit
2007-09-09T06:30:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	you'll get the help you want here that's for sure! (but not from me -sorry)
2007-09-09T06:32:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	well, so far i haven't ... one crummy psychocat link i can't adapt to my situation... can't b elieve its so hard to get an external drive set up
2007-09-09T06:37:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	"what's the bet that" if you #sudo mkdir /home/yupyup.txt you will find it "right there"
2007-09-09T06:47:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	..but??
2007-09-09T06:50:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	 then just don't call it /home, you could call it /newhome if you want, or /otherhome (/ohome)
2007-09-09T06:52:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	 you have a /home directory already. and you said you CAN transfer files onto your external/ext3 harddrive
2007-09-09T06:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	oandrew	yes, i want to ...i don't understand why Jordan_U is asking me to go into live cd?
2007-09-09T06:54:00.000Z	oandrew	livingdaylight	if you want to transfer you whole /home directory to your ext hdd just boot the liveCD and follow that instruction
