2010-07-27T10:21:00.000Z	shorttech		one more question, whats a good terminal server program to use
2010-07-27T10:21:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	you need to share the folder
2010-07-27T10:22:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	the folder is already shared... I can map the drive when I use windows, but no luck with linux
2010-07-27T10:23:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	what's service smbd status
2010-07-27T10:23:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	what;s that say?
2010-07-27T10:25:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	how can I check the service smdb
2010-07-27T10:25:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	"service smbd status
2010-07-27T10:26:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	 "unrecognized service"
2010-07-27T10:26:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	how about sudo service smbd start?
2010-07-27T10:27:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	start: Job is already running: smdb
2010-07-27T10:29:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	try 'smbclient //server/share -U user' see if you can connect that way
2010-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	you don't need the samba server to access shares
2010-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	" - U user" do I put my user name?
2010-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	try the username from the windows box
2010-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	what about under share?
2010-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	that would be the shared folder/directory
2010-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	so smbclient //192.168.1.2/MUSIC -U shorttech
2010-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	not literally :)
2010-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	(Error NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME)
2010-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	can you use the ip adress?
2010-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	usually I just connect to the VPN and them I can map the drive. Im not sure what IP to use
2010-07-27T10:40:00.000Z	natex	shorttech	are you sure you are on the VPN? and if so, try the IP address of the shared box
2010-07-27T10:41:00.000Z	shorttech	natex	it saying that it is connected.
