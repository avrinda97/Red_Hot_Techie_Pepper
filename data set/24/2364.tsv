2009-02-03T11:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	you can replace them with the gnome menu editing tool
2009-02-03T11:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	you can make anything you want in the menu editor.....
2009-02-03T11:20:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	did you do:   sudo apt-get remove --purge wine && rm -rf ~/.wine     or something similar?
2009-02-03T11:20:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	and reinstallation did not recreate the menu?
2009-02-03T11:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	just remake the menu
2009-02-03T11:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	its something like right click on applications -> edit
2009-02-03T11:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	create a wine folder, etc
2009-02-03T11:22:00.000Z	Titan8990	allan_	have any wine programs? make the launchers
