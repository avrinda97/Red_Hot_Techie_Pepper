2005-06-22T08:20:00.000Z	lesshaste		There is some process that is beeping every 20 minutes or so. Is there something cunning I can run to see what it is?
2005-06-22T08:20:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- Try going to your vt1 ... er, ctrl-alt-1 I think it is, or maybe c-a-f1.
2005-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	misaka		My fingers know the answer to that one, but I'm not in front of my linoox box.
2005-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	lesshaste	misaka	and then?
2005-06-22T08:21:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- Look for anything particularly interesting, wait 20 mins to see if anything pops up with the beek.
2005-06-22T08:22:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- That's your console, if there are system errors they could show up there.
2005-06-22T08:22:00.000Z	misaka		But, it's a shot in the dark ... I don't really know what'd be causing beeping, I probably would've just wiped the disk if that happened to me and I didn't know what it was.
2005-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	lesshaste	misaka	drastic :)
2005-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	misaka		Kind of like the first time I saw the goetse man ... had to reintsall to make sure he was properly gone.
2005-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	lesshaste		presumably to beep it must be accessing /dev/something?
2005-06-22T08:23:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- Not necessarily ... sending ^G to a terminal can cause a beep, not sure if that requires a special access to /dev/something.
2005-06-22T08:24:00.000Z	lesshaste		ah ok
2005-06-22T08:24:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- I assume this is a PC-speaker beep, not a soundcard beep?
2005-06-22T08:24:00.000Z	lesshaste		yes.. pc speaker
2005-06-22T08:24:00.000Z	misaka		I'd check for system errors first then. Oh, a-f7 to get back to your X11 terminal from the text console. ;] 
2005-06-22T08:25:00.000Z	lesshaste		no errors
2005-06-22T08:26:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- Nothing special in /var/log/kern.log ?
2005-06-22T08:27:00.000Z	misaka		Now there's a wide-open question.
2005-06-22T08:27:00.000Z	lesshaste		 only an mrtg cron job
2005-06-22T08:28:00.000Z	lesshaste		which runs every 5 minutes, and that has no reason or way to beep
2005-06-22T08:28:00.000Z	misaka		timmy - Probably 'cuz there's a bug in the installer ... ? Random guess there. ;] 
2005-06-22T08:28:00.000Z	lesshaste	misaka	you mean /var/log/messages ?
2005-06-22T08:28:00.000Z	misaka	lesshaste	- I meant kern.log, but check as many log files as you care to.
2005-06-22T08:29:00.000Z	lesshaste	misaka	I don't have kern.log
