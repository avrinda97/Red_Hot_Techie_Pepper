2012-07-20T02:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Just let Ubuntu's installer create the partitions. It's smart enough to know that it needs to create an extended partition with logical partitions within it.
2012-07-20T02:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Please pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l".
2012-07-20T02:59:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	do you have any suggestions/
2012-07-20T03:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Can you boot the Ubuntu LiveCD and run "sudo parted -l"?
2012-07-20T03:01:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	i am in the manage pat.
2012-07-20T03:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Please boot a LiveCD/USB and pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l".
2012-07-20T03:21:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	what is the code again?
2012-07-20T03:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	sudo parted -l
2012-07-20T03:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Since I assume that you're running this from a Fedora LiveCD, run this: su -c "parted -l"

2012-07-20T03:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	I thought that you had deleted one of the 4 partitions already. That does not appear to be true.
2012-07-20T03:30:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	i did
2012-07-20T03:30:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	it is saying that it is used for some reason i don't know why
2012-07-20T03:31:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	the number 3 is free, so is the number 1
2012-07-20T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Parted is very rarely wrong. I think you're mistaken about what you've done.
2012-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	what do you mean
2012-07-20T03:35:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	someone suggest i delete the free partition the number 3 so i can use it in the installation, do this during the custom partition
2012-07-20T03:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	You currently have 4 Primary partitions.
2012-07-20T03:36:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	how do i get rid of 2 of them
2012-07-20T03:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	If you're absolutely certain which ones are the correct ones to delete, use GParted. But *make sure everything you care about is backed up*.
2012-07-20T03:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	"gksu gparted" from a terminal. It's a fairly intuitive GUI application.
2012-07-20T03:40:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	says gksu is not a command
2012-07-20T03:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Moogs	Ask in #fedora.
2012-07-20T04:01:00.000Z	Moogs	Jordan_U	i figured it out, installing fedora! :)
