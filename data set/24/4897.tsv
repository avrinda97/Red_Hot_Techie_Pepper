2007-03-08T06:00:00.000Z	Ace2016		hello?
2007-03-08T06:01:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	if you're behind a router you might want to restart it
2007-03-08T06:01:00.000Z	Ace2016	Jowi	i restarted it many times but still only google works
2007-03-08T06:01:00.000Z	Ace2016	Jowi	but with the sagem fast 800 i can get to any website
2007-03-08T06:02:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	so it is a hardware problem
2007-03-08T06:03:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	a faulty modem/router. replace it. use the sagem one if it works. Might be the MTU value as well. talk with your ISP.
2007-03-08T06:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	or the router manufacturer
2007-03-08T06:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	yes
2007-03-08T06:05:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	sometimes my router hangs so http works but https does not.
2007-03-08T06:05:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	get it replaced.
2007-03-08T06:06:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	faulty hardware happen. replace replace replace :)
2007-03-08T06:06:00.000Z	Ace2016	Jowi	this is right after a restart, i've cleared the settings and checked the settings over and over again but still only google
2007-03-08T06:07:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	you say it is the same in all systems. you say that when you use the sagem 800 it works. you know where the problem is. call the manufacturer if it is under warranty or buy a new one.
2007-03-08T06:08:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	but before you do, check if the MTU value should be something else than the default 1500. and see if there are any firmware upgrades available.
2007-03-08T06:10:00.000Z	Ace2016	Jowi	ok thanks
2007-03-08T06:12:00.000Z	Ace2016	Jowi	how do i get traceroute, since linux hasn't got access to the repos now? i only have traceroute6 which i think is for ipv6 right?
2007-03-08T06:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Ace2016	tracepath
