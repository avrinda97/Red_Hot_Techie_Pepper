2010-06-23T01:05:00.000Z	malikeye|123		I think ubuntu is throttling my CPU when this laptop is plugged in
2010-06-23T01:06:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	you can add cpu frequency applet to the taskbar and set the behaviour
2010-06-23T01:08:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	HAve a dualcore here and added two applets, chose on one cpu0 on the other cpu1 and can also set the mode with a click on it
2010-06-23T01:08:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	which app is that?
2010-06-23T01:09:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	right click the upper taskbar and choose add to panel
2010-06-23T01:10:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	then go down until you see something like monitor cpu-frequency, have another locale than english here, so it can be named otherwise :)
2010-06-23T01:10:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	I'm using XFCE and that XFCE one doesn't actually control it... are you using gnome?
2010-06-23T01:10:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	yeah, I use gnome
2010-06-23T01:11:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	hhhm, good question :)
2010-06-23T01:11:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	right click it and hit "About"
2010-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	as I said, using another language than english :(
2010-06-23T01:13:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	think cpufreq-applet, thats at least what appears as task
2010-06-23T01:15:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	yeah, confirmed, I killed it to try and the applets disappeared :)
2010-06-23T01:19:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	can you do this? dpkg --search cpufreq-applet
2010-06-23T01:19:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	did it already, didn'T come up with a result
2010-06-23T01:21:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	gonna pastebin it
2010-06-23T01:23:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	http://pastebin.com/ZRYUdTd4
2010-06-23T01:25:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	will probably load also some other dependencies of gnome
2010-06-23T01:26:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	well, it's also with some nice KDE stuff, I really liked kate and sometimes installed it, and this pulled some kde-packages as well ;)
2010-06-23T01:32:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	mabye this can help http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-xfapplet-plugin
2010-06-23T01:37:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	you can set it to powersave or performance and so on, neat :)
2010-06-23T01:37:00.000Z	ubutom	malikeye|123	np
2010-06-24T19:49:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	you remember my slow VM performance from the other day?
2010-06-24T19:50:00.000Z	malikeye|123	ubutom	turns out, there is a sysctl tweak you can make with the scheduler that increases performance a whole ton
