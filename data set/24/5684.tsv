2007-10-08T07:37:00.000Z	weazzle		should't be an issue though
2007-10-08T07:37:00.000Z	weazzle		got the right port though
2007-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	weazzle		no firewall between these machines, unless they have on onboard
2007-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	weazzle		I will try that again
2007-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	weazzle		restarted
2007-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	weazzle		Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer
2007-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	weazzle		when I tried to ssh
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	weazzle		had -p PORT before the address, not sure that it would matter
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	weazzle		nope
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	weazzle		same error
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	both works, just my old habit of typing it at the end :)
2007-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	weazzle		gotcha :)
2007-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	btw are you sure you edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config and not /etc/ssh/ssh_config ?
2007-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	weazzle	slackern	yeah, should have since when I restarted it was listening on the new port
2007-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	ahh alright, just checking :)
2007-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	weazzle		when I change back to default and restart it works
2007-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	weazzle		so it appears that there is some manager similar to inetd still watching port 22
2007-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	weazzle	slackern	sorry, forgot to prepend name, it appears that there is some manager similar to inetd still watching port 22
2007-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	weazzle	slackern	as switching back to port 22 works without issue still
2007-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	sorry running back and forth making food here, so a little busy :)
2007-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	weazzle	slackern	no worries, I am patient. I realize people on here have lives beyond IRC ;)
2007-10-08T07:48:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	all i did on my server was to change "Port 22" to "Port 30000" and do a sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload or if it was a restart and i was all set, but i also run a firewall script there so i changed port in that also and it just worked, im kind of clueless right now :)
2007-10-08T07:48:00.000Z	slackern	weazzle	maybe forgotten to restart the firewall script if you run something like that so the rules updated?
2007-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	weazzle	slackern	so maybe iptables evaluates /etc/services?
