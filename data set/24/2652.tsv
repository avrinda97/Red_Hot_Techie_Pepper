2008-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	assumedalive		hi all, on a recent install of ubuntu 8.04 with an x1600 graphics card, xvideo output is not working
2008-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	assumedalive		xvinfo reports no adapters found
2008-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	assumedalive		ï»¿i was under the impression that the default open source drivers for radeon r500 card in ubuntu supported xvideo
2008-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	assumedalive		i have changed nothing
2008-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	assumedalive		i installed in 5 minutes ago
2008-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	assumedalive		in the hope that a reinstallation might make xv work
2008-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	what gpu are you using? and what's wrong with xv?
2008-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	it is an ati rv530 [radeon x1600], xvinfo reports no adatpers found
2008-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	get the restricted driver?
2008-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	the restricted driver is horrible
2008-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	why?
2008-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	xv with the restricted driver has horrible tearing, i get video corruption and i just dont like the closed source drivers at all
2008-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	thats not the point, the open source drivers for rv530 cards have perfectly working xv support
2008-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	well what drivers are you using right now
2008-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	how do i check
2008-10-04T20:09:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-10-04T20:09:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	just returns the keyboard/mouse drivers
2008-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	shall i specify driver "ati" in the video card section of xorg.conf
2008-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	it might be using vesa by default
2008-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	ok will be back in a bit
2008-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	hyperair	assumedalive	good luck
2008-10-04T20:23:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	using the ati driver now
2008-10-04T20:23:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	still nothing
2008-10-04T20:23:00.000Z	assumedalive	hyperair	also no direct rendering
