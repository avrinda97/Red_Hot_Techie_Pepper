2006-11-23T13:23:00.000Z	kishan		oooh that is the problem u need to dowload a package called alternative cd to install the ubuntu
2006-11-23T13:24:00.000Z	kishan		PurpleMokey generally it depends on destro if u can manually arrage partion then u can install without erasing the ubuntu
2006-11-23T13:25:00.000Z	kishan		it can be gotit but 128 is not recomended only 256 is recommede to install
2006-11-23T13:25:00.000Z	kishan		i suggest gotit to install xbuntu which will work well on it
2006-11-23T13:27:00.000Z	kishan		well gotit as i said u cannot install on 128 mb with the live cd u need alternative cd to install it but still give a try
2006-11-23T13:28:00.000Z	kishan		just click install on the icon on the desktop and follow the instructions
2006-11-23T13:28:00.000Z	kishan		but evern the live cd hungs when u try to install on 128 mb thats why i suggest u to try XBUNTU which works well on these old systems

2006-11-23T13:46:00.000Z	kishan	ubuntu	: do we need to install driver for intel video card
2006-11-23T13:48:00.000Z	ubuntu	kishan	No, intel cards just work because intel releases their drivers open source.
2006-11-23T13:48:00.000Z	ubuntu	kishan	They supported AIGLX months before nvidia for the same reason
