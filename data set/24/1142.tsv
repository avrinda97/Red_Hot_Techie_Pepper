2010-06-20T18:36:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		and cannot be opened from cui or gui
2010-06-20T18:36:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		but can open only when i unlock that folder
2010-06-20T18:37:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		no i did that way back in windows 98
2010-06-20T18:38:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		and i am kind of looking that on windows as well
2010-06-20T18:38:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		and i am kind of looking that on ubuntu as well
2010-06-20T18:39:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		is there any way around
2010-06-20T18:41:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		i dont want to hide that folder in any way and i also want that folder to behave as ordinary also
2010-06-20T18:41:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		like other folders
2010-06-20T18:42:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		yes it is very strange that grub failed on fresh install
2010-06-20T18:42:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits		it might be due to improper installation of the OS
2010-06-20T18:42:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	I have a problem that the Ubuntu installation fails to boot (probably during kernel load) but don't have a clue what the problem is.
2010-06-20T18:44:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	Yes that is the options I'm trying to get some hints on how to change to get the installation to boot
2010-06-20T18:46:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	How can it be corrupted if I have tried both from a USB and a CD and the USB-pendrive was working to do an install on another machine
2010-06-20T18:47:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	i mean to say that corruption can also occur when the copying of grub did not took place in a right way
2010-06-20T18:48:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	but the problem occurs even before I can boot up the installation gui?
2010-06-20T18:49:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	see grub is equally the part of your boot up process
2010-06-20T18:50:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	Yes so the question if it is grub or the kernel that fails
2010-06-20T18:50:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	grub and kernel are the part of booting process
2010-06-20T18:51:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	Yes that is why it should be one of them ;)
2010-06-20T18:52:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	if you are planning to build somthing and the base is not strong them whole thing gets down
2010-06-20T18:52:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	grub and kernel are the part of loading the system
2010-06-20T18:54:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	if grub was not configured properly then boot procedure somehow fails
2010-06-20T18:54:00.000Z	DestinyAwaits	sampe	 do you have ubuntu cd with you
2010-06-20T18:55:00.000Z	sampe	DestinyAwaits	Se above message to Vigo...
