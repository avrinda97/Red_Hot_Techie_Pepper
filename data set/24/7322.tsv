2007-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		can anyone help me fix a problem with my gfx chipset?
2007-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		i have just installed ubuntu edgy on my computer, it has an integrated intel 82865G graphics chipset. It's stuck at 640x480 resolution and i have no other resolution
2007-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		they are added there i think cos i checked
2007-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		i read about a problem with the intel graphics. i tried installing 915resolution but it didn't work
2007-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	if you know what resolution your monitor/gfx card supports you could add the resolution to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf resolution section.
2007-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		there are no resolutions listed in xorg.conf
2007-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	can you paste the content of xorg.conf here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and post the link to it here?
2007-04-13T09:12:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15391/
2007-04-13T09:13:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		all resolutions in the file are 1024x768
2007-04-13T09:13:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		but my res is still 640x480
2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr	tanto	apt-get intall coffeemaker
2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	yup looks like a fallback because those don't work either.
2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	do you speak german?
2007-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		no i don't speak german. sry
2007-04-13T09:15:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	bummer, I've found a thread with similar problems could be a solution.
2007-04-13T09:15:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		post the link pls i could try to use an online translator, maybe make something out
2007-04-13T09:16:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/33988/   last post seems to be the solution. But the problems where with an Acer monitor. so not sure. but xorg.conf shows the same chipset as yours.
2007-04-13T09:16:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	maybe search the english forums for your chipset too. I just googled a bit.
2007-04-13T09:17:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		btw in case it's any use, i have a normal crt monitor 17"
2007-04-13T09:18:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	hm yea I am not too familiar with detailed xorg settings, probably the thread posted is of no use. lets see what the forums say.
2007-04-13T09:19:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	did you scan that thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=351647&highlight=82865G  ?
2007-04-13T09:19:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		not yet
2007-04-13T09:19:00.000Z	VrIgHtEr		ill check it out
2007-04-13T09:19:00.000Z	predaeus	VrIgHtEr	try searching the forums some more, if you did not already. Might help.
