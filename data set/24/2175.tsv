2009-04-03T13:16:00.000Z	creator-cdsc		in linux, are there any applications available which install a software for you? (like windows installer in windows)      (apart from Synaptic packet manager or apt or aptitude)
2009-04-03T13:17:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	synaptic is apt, and apt is your manager
2009-04-03T13:19:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	ok, there are a lot of packages which are not available in the repositories, so if i download their source code from the net, are there any applications which would give me a GUI to install the software?
2009-04-03T13:19:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	you just compile and run
2009-04-03T13:20:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	but see if you can find a .deb package, it's usually better
2009-04-03T13:21:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	yes i just have to compile and run, but is there any application availabe which would let me just click on a button and do it? for example in windows, you just have to click on the install icon and it does the rest for you
2009-04-03T13:21:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	no
2009-04-03T13:21:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	on windows you're not compiling from source
2009-04-03T13:22:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	that's what a debian package would be, more or less
2009-04-03T13:22:00.000Z	shivamib		you install it using dpkg -i package.deb
2009-04-03T13:23:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	right, you don't get the source, but then what does the install do in windows?
2009-04-03T13:23:00.000Z	shivamib		installs the binary
2009-04-03T13:23:00.000Z	shivamib		and messes with registry
2009-04-03T13:24:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	but you dont really need to "install" anything
2009-04-03T13:24:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	usually you put those programs on /var/opt/
2009-04-03T13:25:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	i was thinking of a project idea for the summers, and i started thinking about why people in general don't use linux. they don't want to type in commands, so if there is some GUI for that as well, then it would be useful
2009-04-03T13:25:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	that's what synaptic is about. but once you leave the repositories, you're on your own
2009-04-03T13:26:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	and really, the console is your friend
2009-04-03T13:26:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	you'll get used to it
2009-04-03T13:27:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	yes, but can something be built which would make it easier for the not-so-familiar-console guy to install applications not availabe in the repositories?
2009-04-03T13:27:00.000Z	shivamib	creator-cdsc	yes, you build a deb package for that specific app
2009-04-03T13:28:00.000Z	shivamib		and if it's useful it could be integrated to the repository
2009-04-03T13:28:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	oh ok, can you tell me some project idea if you hace a
2009-04-03T13:28:00.000Z	creator-cdsc	shivamib	oh ok, can you tell me some project idea that i could pursue? it should be somethign that would make it easier for a normal person to use linux
