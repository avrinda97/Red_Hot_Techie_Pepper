2007-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	arcade		So.. USB cameras.
2007-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	arcade		That iss, simple mass storage devices.
2007-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	arcade		How do I find the _Device_?
2007-05-17T12:51:00.000Z	arcade		It just automagically pops up on my desktop, but I need the actual device.
2007-05-17T12:51:00.000Z	arcade		which isn't very usefull.
2007-05-17T12:52:00.000Z	BlackBsd	arcade	you can use dmesg to figure out what device you just plugged in
2007-05-17T12:52:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	Normally, yes, but with ubuntu that was kind of difficult :P  [45731.593635]  usb 2-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
2007-05-17T12:53:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	Bus 002 Device 004: ID 04a9:310e Canon, Inc.
2007-05-17T12:53:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	still doesn't give me a nice mountable device.
2007-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	BlackBsd	arcade	just do a dmesg without tail
2007-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	yes?  It doesn't give me a nice /dev/sdXX anymore.
2007-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	Ubuntu _doesn't_.  It only tells you:
2007-05-17T12:54:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	Ubuntu _doesn't_.  It only tells you:
2007-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	_That_Is_It_.  It used to give you a nice device number.  Now that's all you get, and a 'camera' icon on the desktop.
2007-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	huh?
2007-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	It is, I can browse things and so forth, but I need the _Device_ so that I can dd it out.
2007-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	and then find the erased pictures out of the fine little fat12 filesystem on it.
2007-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	This used to be incredibly simple, but the "user friendlyness" has hidden the simplicity.
2007-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	No, I want to dd the entire fat12 filesystem out of it. :)
2007-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	But I need the device.
2007-05-17T12:57:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	But all ubuntu wants to give me is a "User friendly" interface to it, which is completely useless.
2007-05-17T12:58:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	good idea.
2007-05-17T12:59:00.000Z	arcade	BlackBsd	unfortunately: no difference. :/
2007-05-17T13:02:00.000Z	BlackBsd	arcade	try adding the -d option to the ls so it will list directory entries also
