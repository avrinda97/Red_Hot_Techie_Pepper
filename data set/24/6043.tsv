2006-03-12T06:05:00.000Z	DJ_tobias		anybody in here using a wireless card?
2006-03-12T06:05:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	I use ipw2200
2006-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	do you need ndiswrapper to get that working?
2006-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	no, ipw2200 is in kernel
2006-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	cool what card is that?
2006-03-12T06:07:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	Intel PRO/Wireless
2006-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	do they sell that at compusa ?
2006-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	it's mini-pci, I think so, about $30 each, and with most pentium-M laptops
2006-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	ipw2200 is the easiest for me, driver in kernel, but it needs a firmware :( I don't like that
2006-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	DJ_tobias		hmm dli is there a list of wireless cards that are compatible with linux and DONT need ndiswrapper
2006-03-12T06:09:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	I suppose the good place to check is in kernel source, "make menuconfig"
2006-03-12T06:10:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	you may go with ipw, because intel does release drivers for it
2006-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	so when you plug the card in does it automatically detect it?
2006-03-12T06:11:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	yes, most installation disk should drive it up
2006-03-12T06:12:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	ipw2200 has been working as a package for long, but only in kernel >=2.6.14
2006-03-12T06:13:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	you can buy from newegg.com , or compUSA
2006-03-12T06:13:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	ok thanks

2006-03-12T06:16:00.000Z	dli	DJ_tobias	sorry, I thought you mean notebook :(
2006-03-12T06:17:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	dli	Ah its cool! i appreciate the help, would you know of any desktop wireless cards that are compitable without using ndiswrapper?
