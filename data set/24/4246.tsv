2007-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	we're humans too
2007-07-10T16:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	what now
2007-07-10T16:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	thats exactly why
2007-07-10T16:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	yep
2007-07-10T16:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	he was also advising someone to reinstall ubuntu for some password issue
2007-07-10T16:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	is it an issue of "switching"?
2007-07-10T16:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	isnt a package a package?
2007-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	his words, not mine
2007-07-10T16:19:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	it's your own, not root's pass
2007-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	why not?
2007-07-10T16:23:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	because many things in ubuntu are preferred to be done with sudo, most of the graphical tools that require root privileges ask for the password of the user logged in and having admin rights
2007-07-10T16:23:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	is there a disadvantage to setting a root pw?
2007-07-10T16:24:00.000Z	Myrtti	shiester_miester	yes.
2007-07-10T16:25:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Myrtti	lol, amusing
