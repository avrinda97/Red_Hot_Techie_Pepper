2007-04-10T05:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	bruenig	it ensures you don't miss the fact that its asking for password, so that you don't keep clicking elsewhere trying to get into other windows.
2007-04-10T05:14:00.000Z	PriceChild	bruenig	it needs to lock everything else out to ensure nothing snips the password.
