2007-04-22T06:00:00.000Z	badkitty		Does anyone have any experience working with  vmware and ubuntu?
2007-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	snaunton	badkitty	 - yep
2007-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	snaunton	badkitty	- use qemu though, it is open source
2007-04-22T06:01:00.000Z	badkitty	snaunton	ax4: I cannot get the server edition to get a network connection with vmware
2007-04-22T06:02:00.000Z	snaunton	badkitty	- did you use vmware via synaptic apt-get etc or from vmware's web site?
2007-04-22T06:02:00.000Z	badkitty		I downloaded two different appliances from their site
2007-04-22T06:03:00.000Z	badkitty		Ive tried both bridged and NAT connection(vmware setting)
2007-04-22T06:04:00.000Z	badkitty		I also looked at the config it says something like auto eth0 ifconfig eth0 dhcp inet ....
2007-04-22T06:06:00.000Z	badkitty		Any ideas for my networking issue anyone?
2007-04-22T06:06:00.000Z	badkitty		Im trying to get vmware working with ubuntu server as far as network access... i have none
2007-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	badkitty		I think i saw an upgrade from iso feature in the docs somewhere
2007-04-22T06:09:00.000Z	badkitty		Automatix broke my system bad and I lost lots of time (especially cause I had beryl working after many issues)
2007-04-22T06:09:00.000Z	badkitty		Automatix actually installed an upgrade when there was none lol
2007-04-22T06:12:00.000Z	badkitty		i hear feisty has improved support for vmware
2007-04-22T06:13:00.000Z	badkitty		ubuntu

2007-04-22T06:17:00.000Z	snaunton	badkitty	- what does ifconfig return
2007-04-22T06:17:00.000Z	badkitty	snaunton	just lo
2007-04-22T06:18:00.000Z	snaunton		That will be why... you do not have a network card installed.
2007-04-22T06:18:00.000Z	badkitty		Local loopback
2007-04-22T06:18:00.000Z	badkitty		well its a virtual appliance....
2007-04-22T06:18:00.000Z	snaunton	badkitty	- which can have virtual n/w cards installed... or not.
