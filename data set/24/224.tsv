2012-02-25T02:02:00.000Z	jsebean		How do I setup Ubuntu to record both the audio of skype and my microphone?
2012-02-25T02:02:00.000Z	jsebean		On windows I used Stereo Mix and unmuted my microphone
2012-02-25T02:02:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  see Skype Call Recorder
2012-02-25T02:03:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	I want to do it with a screen recorder
2012-02-25T02:03:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	Basically I want to record everything from the PC, including the mic. So all audio
2012-02-25T02:03:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  I know there's a way, but I've never done that set up.  sorry.
2012-02-25T02:06:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  see http://www.webupd8.org/2011/09/record-audio-from-sound-card-or.html
2012-02-25T02:07:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  pretty sure that skype requires you prioritize either system sound or skype - but not both.
2012-02-25T02:07:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	I'll check out the link
2012-02-25T02:08:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  only workaround I can see is to set up separate recording streams: 1 for skype, 1 for mic...
2012-02-25T02:09:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	how do I do that?
2012-02-25T02:11:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	hydrox24: Basically the goal is we want to play minecraft, have other players on a server talking on skype, and record the audio from my computer, the skype chatters and the game sounds (minecraft sounds) itself all at the same time being recorded by the screen recorder. Of at most, in audacity and sync the audio with the video later
2012-02-25T02:11:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  sorry, as I said, IDK.  My theory is you'd run one app to capture skype input and another app to capture mic, e.g. skype-call-recorder (or simillar) and Audacity.  Audacity can be set up to capture the system/mic sounds.  NOTE:  theory only.  I've never tested it.  But Audacity is quite adaptable.
2012-02-25T02:11:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  You don't have to do all the recording on the same box, right?  1 box records all skype, other records all mic/system sounds
2012-02-25T02:12:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  meet up later to synch audios...
2012-02-25T02:12:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	Well the skype vs other records mic/system sounds isnt the really the problem, thing is i can only get ubuntu to 1. Record my mic only or 2. record skype and all system sounds but not my mic
2012-02-25T02:13:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	 how's this...conference call the skype and have another skyper record audio and you record system sounds...
2012-02-25T02:14:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  there are multiple skype-record utilities available...
2012-02-25T02:15:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  break up the task between different boxes...
2012-02-25T02:15:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	That's a lot of work lol
2012-02-25T02:16:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  you sound like a clever guy, I'm sure you can arrange it.  Besides, if you're minecraft multiplayer, you've already got a network going.  Just have someone else record the skype stream.
2012-02-25T02:17:00.000Z	jsebean	CFHowlett	I think I can arrange something. If I was privileged to have a real mixing board then I'd be set lol
2012-02-25T02:18:00.000Z	CFHowlett	jsebean	  true.  This would be worth a write up or tutorial, so keep notes of your solution...
