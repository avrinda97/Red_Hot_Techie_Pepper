2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	sinblox		ok, I have a really newbie question -- I'm trying to download a .deb file and it's opening up automatically with the file-roller program - but it won't run it.
2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	sinblox		What can I do?
2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	sinblox		it says "archive type not supported"
2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	whats the name of the program? you might just be able to apt-get it
2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	sinblox	NickGarvey	it's calledamsn
2006-03-22T10:11:00.000Z	sinblox		I'll try save as
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	know what console is and how it works?
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey		night
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	sinblox	NickGarvey	Pretty much
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey		open it
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	type "sudo apt-get install amsn"
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	NickGarvey		although sinblox, I would advise GAIM
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	sinblox		Nickgarvey/Tritium: I'll give that a try
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	sinblox		really?
2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	sinblox		Maybe I should gave the new 2.00 beta of gaim a try
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	sinblox		to be honest I couldn't really figure out how to get the RPM files working so I didn't get that one working, haha.
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	sinblox		I think it was because I wasn't running them like that
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	sinblox		older version is better?
2006-03-22T10:14:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	rpms won't work on ubuntu
2006-03-22T10:14:00.000Z	sinblox		Ohhh
2006-03-22T10:14:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	rpms are "red hat package managers"
2006-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	sinblox		ah, now I feel silly for how I was trying to get a bunch of other programs to work
2006-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	ubuntu is debian based not red hat
2006-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	NickGarvey	sinblox	I hear synaptic is very good although I know nothing about it
