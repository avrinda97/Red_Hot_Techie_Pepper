2008-12-07T01:02:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Could somebody help me out with setting up a webcam under Ubuntu? It should be working, but any ideas on how to get ubuntu to recognize that its connected?
2008-12-07T01:02:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	you can see logs in dmesg when you plug it in?
2008-12-07T01:04:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	would I just go to system messages, or do I use a terminal to see the updates from dmesg
2008-12-07T01:05:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	And hold on I'll be right back
2008-12-07T01:05:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	is usually just run dmesg in  a terminal before and after plugin in hardware
2008-12-07T01:08:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	would I check dmesg from the terminal or from syslogs?
2008-12-07T01:09:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	terminal.
2008-12-07T01:09:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	command?
2008-12-07T01:10:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	"[  231.140078] hub 3-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1"
2008-12-07T01:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	did you try other devices on that hib/port?
2008-12-07T01:11:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	I know it works
2008-12-07T01:12:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	the cam works on other computers? or is the cable bad..
2008-12-07T01:12:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	Should work brand new
2008-12-07T01:12:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	Sorta
2008-12-07T01:15:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	It should work seeing as how its new. Well, sort of.
2008-12-07T01:16:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	every usb device should get an address (visible in dmesg) and be seen with lsusb, even if your ubuntu did not have a driver for it. so you have a hardware problem with it right now
2008-12-07T01:16:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	could it be because it wasnt officially supposed to work with linux?
2008-12-07T01:17:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	I've heard of people getting it to work, but that was under Gentoo, so....
2008-12-07T01:17:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	nope. even these devices show up in lsusb and dmesg.
2008-12-07T01:18:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	any ideas?
2008-12-07T01:18:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	not really
2008-12-16T04:40:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	what do you mean? simultaneous downloads? it certainly downloads many packages, one after the other when you install a lot
2008-12-16T04:40:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	zsquareplusc	yes, would a couple of simultaneous downloads be a problem or just a fluke?
2008-12-16T04:41:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GodfatherofEire	that is no problem. it just downloads first and with 2 connections it can be quicker.
