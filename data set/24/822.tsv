2011-02-07T01:39:00.000Z	DaGeek247	Deddly	you should be fine with minor differences. they need too be connected.
2011-02-07T01:41:00.000Z	Deddly	DaGeek247	Is it as simple as firing them both up and clicking on the wireless icon?
2011-02-07T01:42:00.000Z	DaGeek247	Deddly	no, its close. the two computrs need to be connected to the same router. are they?
2011-02-07T01:43:00.000Z	Deddly	DaGeek247	Not exactly... I'm tethering through a mobile phone, but I can tether both through one mobile
