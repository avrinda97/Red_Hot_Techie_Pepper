2011-03-13T16:52:00.000Z	^jude^		can anyone help me with some grub2 advice?
2011-03-13T16:52:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	just ask :D dont' ask about asking
2011-03-13T16:52:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	tried that, but thought maybe I got lost in the noise :)
2011-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	guess it just meant no-one can help :/
2011-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	yeah, that can happen, a lot of chaos here ;)
2011-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	that's not true... everyone wants to help, the question is if the know how
2011-03-13T16:54:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	yeah, I said "no-one can", not "no-one will" :)
2011-03-13T16:54:00.000Z	^jude^		I am about to install 10.04 on a separate HDD in this machine, but I want to use the grub on the current 9.10 install. Am I right that I just need to do the install, boot into my normal 9.10 and do "grub-update" to add the new 10.04 install to the grub menu?
2011-03-13T16:54:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	during installation of new system, newer grub will be installed and it will detect other systems, including linux and windows and others
2011-03-13T16:55:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	I specifically don't want that - I want to use the grub2 install I already have - 10.04 is for testing only and may not stay
2011-03-13T16:55:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	hm, not sure how to do that then. maybe downloading alternate cd
2011-03-13T16:56:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	I know I can tell the installer not to touch the MBR, it's only the bit about adding it to the existing grub2 I'm a bit fuzzy on
2011-03-13T16:57:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	I guess I will just have to suck it and see :)
2011-03-13T16:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	alternative installation cd will ask what to do with grub if I remember correctly
2011-03-13T16:58:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	lovely - I shall grab a copy and use that instead then
2011-03-13T16:58:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	thanks for the tip
2011-03-13T16:58:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	am not 100% ... be careful
2011-03-13T16:58:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	maybe try installing in vbox first?
2011-03-13T16:58:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	noted, ta
2011-03-13T16:59:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	that's a bit pointless in this case - the new HDD is an SSD and I want to check out performance
2011-03-13T17:00:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	ok, just trying to play safe ;D
2011-03-13T17:00:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	apprecietaed :)
2011-03-13T17:01:00.000Z	^jude^	MeanEYE	appreciated :) [wish I could type properly]
2011-03-13T17:01:00.000Z	MeanEYE	^jude^	my english is weird today as well
