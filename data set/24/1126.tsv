2010-07-03T06:26:00.000Z	wodKa		anyone else willing to help me out since the guy that was helping me left? :/ im about to give up
2010-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	have you attempted to fresh install 10.04?
2010-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	yes, 9.04, 9.10, and 10.04. all give me the same problem
2010-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	and since I'm late to the party.. what is the problem?
2010-07-03T06:30:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	everything freezes and processes running stop (wifi, downloads, music, etc) after about 30 seconds of inactivity. moving the mouse or any other kind of user input makes it snap out
2010-07-03T06:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	anything show up on dmesg?
2010-07-03T06:31:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	i don't know what i'm looking for but theres nothing obvious sticking out to me
2010-07-03T06:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	should be at the tail end of the file.. and if it's not looking like a sore thumb then probably doesn't show there.. Is this a home built machine, store bought, desktop or laptop?
2010-07-03T06:33:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	store bought gateway laptop, ran 8.04 and 8.10 fine as well as vista
2010-07-03T06:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	vista isn't a good comparison.. 8.04 & 8.10 are.. the question is what's changed enough to give the machine a headache..
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	could be a touchpad thing..  maybe ACPI... AH! do you have a separate /home directory?
2010-07-03T06:35:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	not that i know of, everything on the install was default. clean format and install
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	so no separate home with old stuff lying around.. well.. that makes it more difficult.. what's the make and model of the gateway?
2010-07-03T06:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	DOH!  what's the model of the gateway
2010-07-03T06:37:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	it's a M-153xl
2010-07-03T06:38:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzQHzIjQaws
2010-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	most likely it's related to the ATI card.. but I"m guessing.. there have been issues with ATI after a certain release because X.org was updated and the drivers ATI provided were for specific cards only.. Unfortunately I"m no ATI guy.. Nvidia here.. which has always worked well except on my machine with 10.04 ubuntu.. but fine with Kubuntu.. have you tried kubuntu?
2010-07-03T06:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	I'd betchya a dollar to a donut that it's the ATI card doing it.
2010-07-03T06:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	check the ati site and see what cards are supported by the latest driver for linux.. see if you card is listed..
2010-07-03T06:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	then I think there's an ATI driver and one produced by someone else.. checkem' both out to see if they may work.. sorry.. that's about all I can offer.
2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	wodKa	Scunizi	the driver on their site says "Automated installer and Display Drivers for X.Org 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, or 7.5"
2010-07-03T06:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	yes.. but what cards does it support
2010-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	the current versioin is 7.1 or above.. not sure which
2010-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	wodKa	good luck!
