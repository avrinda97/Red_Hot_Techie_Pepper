2007-10-01T08:43:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	Ctrl-Alt-Backspace kills X if X is RUNNING ;)

2007-10-01T09:07:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	how did you get to term? Ctrl-Alt-F1?
2007-10-01T09:08:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	or did you kill it via gdm stop?
2007-10-01T09:08:00.000Z	slimjimflim	scguy318	yea f2 though
2007-10-01T09:09:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	then X is still running...
2007-10-01T09:09:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	if you just switched it and didn't kill gdm

2007-10-01T09:30:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	on Wine, its DX -> libs -> OpenGL
2007-10-01T09:31:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	have you peeked at AppDb?
2007-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	slimjimflim	scguy318	i'll keep that in mind (or in .txt) until i have a gui again
2007-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	slimjimflim	scguy318	what's AppDb
2007-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	the Wine AppDb is a site where you can get information on application compatibility with Wine, and how to get them working http://appdb.winehq.org
2007-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	slimjimflim	scguy318	when starting gdm, i get a message saying that the kernel module version is different from "this" module. i'm assuming that is the most recently installed one.  how can i get both of those versions back to their original default versions?
2007-10-01T09:41:00.000Z	scguy318	slimjimflim	reinstall nvidia-glx I would imagine
