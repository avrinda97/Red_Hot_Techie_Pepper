2012-01-13T20:18:00.000Z	john_doe_jr		hey I just downloaded an adobe reader binary...where do I put the binary so that it will be available system wide?  /usr/bin/ ?
2012-01-13T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	anywhere you want
2012-01-13T20:19:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	but I know it's not available system wide though right now
2012-01-13T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	what do you mean "available system wide"
2012-01-13T20:20:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	well I think I have to place it in /usr/bin/  to make sure that it is available @ the command prompt right?
2012-01-13T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	echo $PATH - anything in those directories you can invoke by just typing the command
2012-01-13T20:28:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	I'm trying to open a pdf from the command line w/ the Adobe Reader binary file...it won't work...how would you go about doing it?  AdobeReader.bin ~/Downloads/book.pdf ?
2012-01-13T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	I don't think you can pass AdobeReader.bin arguments
2012-01-13T20:29:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	then how would u use the binary then?  I'm confused
2012-01-13T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	run the binary, it opens the gui, then open the document in that gui
2012-01-13T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	or look at the other pdf viewers which are already part of ubuntu
2012-01-13T20:31:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	how do you "run the binary" from the command line?
2012-01-13T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	I'd advise you to use one of the packaged built for ubuntu to get the gui as part of your desktop
2012-01-13T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	you will find it much easier
2012-01-13T20:32:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	how do you do that?
2012-01-13T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	do you know how to use the ubuntu package manager ?
2012-01-13T20:33:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	synaptic ?
2012-01-13T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	that's one of them, if you open the package manager and search for the applications ubottu gave you twice, you can install them
2012-01-13T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	those applications are then part of your desktop experience
2012-01-13T20:33:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	adobe isn't in repository
2012-01-13T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	rather than having to load applications from the command line
2012-01-13T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	I know adobe isn't that's why I had ubottu give you links for different pdf readers
2012-01-13T20:35:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	ikonia	I'm just gonn use xpdf
2012-01-13T20:35:00.000Z	ikonia	john_doe_jr	that's a good plan
