2008-03-22T18:19:00.000Z	amenado		ompaul-> if you run X -query serverhost  thats insecure right? so you use that only locally on local lan?
2008-03-22T18:20:00.000Z	amenado		ailean-> maybe your advantage will be learning packaging process?
2008-03-22T18:21:00.000Z	amenado		alterune-> i suggest perhaps going over same tutorial you used to load the codecs, and other libraries for a re-install of those?
2008-03-22T18:22:00.000Z	amenado		ailean-> if you are interested in doing that kind of thing, maybe look into embedded linux? like ucLinux  ? gets you to build everything
2008-03-22T18:23:00.000Z	amenado		ailean-> then ideal to learn is the embedded linux...
2008-03-22T18:24:00.000Z	amenado		ailean-> one of the apps is mobile phones, network appliances, sbc..etc
2008-03-22T18:25:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	but i wouldn't get any real use from it other than learning about linux, true?
2008-03-22T18:25:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	so i could set up a wee partition just to play with
2008-03-22T18:26:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	its a big industry.. embedded stuff..like symbian
2008-03-22T18:26:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	yeah, but i'm no programmer :D
2008-03-22T18:27:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	you are on your way to become one are you not? :P
2008-03-22T18:28:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	even more so, using whats that called process management system  ..used to monitor health of systems
2008-03-22T18:29:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	SCADA ?
2008-03-22T18:30:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	yeah, same thing
2008-03-22T18:30:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	linux would be used in a lot of that
2008-03-22T18:31:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	okay..so you know they been using that for that special purpose..so you are in-tuned
2008-03-22T18:31:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	right i'm convinced
2008-03-22T18:32:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	i'd work with on a higher level though.  the os used on such a system wouldn't matter to me
2008-03-22T18:32:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	probably :)
2008-03-22T18:33:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	i don't concern myself with how the internal components work - more how to design a building
2008-03-22T18:33:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	i think most large industry is in the process of revamping/retooling their SCADA..i know local gas and electric here is
2008-03-22T18:34:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	what i would be interested in, though, is creating modelling software that would be able to automate a lot of the design work necessary in heating systems, ventilation etc.
2008-03-22T18:35:00.000Z	ailean	amenado	i'll see you later
2008-03-22T18:35:00.000Z	amenado	ailean	laters
