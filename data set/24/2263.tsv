2010-06-10T12:12:00.000Z	farciarz84		hi, I shared my folder in the network, how it can be accesibble from the other comupters?
2010-06-10T12:13:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	it's accessible through the network... places > network
2010-06-10T12:13:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	it's also accessible through windows machines ;)
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	sorry, but there is only windows-network without my machine
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	can it be accessible trough ip adress?
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	I prefer hostname
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	whatever
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	//(host hame)/(share)
2010-06-10T12:14:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	thx
2010-06-10T12:15:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	no prob.
2010-06-10T12:16:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.InvalidArgs: Mountpoint Already registered
2010-06-10T12:17:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	hmm, seems like you already mounted it
2010-06-10T12:17:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	can you tell me how I can access the directory from windows?/
2010-06-10T12:17:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	go to your /home/(your name)/.gvfs/ folder and see if it's there
2010-06-10T12:18:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	yeah, map network drive...
2010-06-10T12:19:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	no it is not there '(..)/.gvfs'
2010-06-10T12:19:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	so, your .gvfs folder is empty?
2010-06-10T12:19:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	but the folder has double arrows
2010-06-10T12:20:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	.gvfs is empty
2010-06-10T12:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	huh, I guess you didn't mount it...
2010-06-10T12:20:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	should I?
2010-06-10T12:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	hmm...
2010-06-10T12:24:00.000Z	p1oooop	farciarz84	places > connect to server > (service type: windows share; server: (your server); share: (your share name)
2010-06-10T12:48:00.000Z	farciarz84	p1oooop	I've already check that but with hostname this is not possible, with ip address I see also some error, but I can see the folders
