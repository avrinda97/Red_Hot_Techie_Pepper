2006-09-23T07:17:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	USE is barely used anymore really
2006-09-23T07:18:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	huh, i always thought that was a cornerstone of gentoo
2006-09-23T07:18:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	gentoo uses it, but it's not really used
2006-09-23T07:19:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	i thought you could do stuff like switch PAM or NLS or other really pervasive stuff on and off with it
2006-09-23T07:19:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	but in essence you don't have to use USE at all everything is done with configure now
2006-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	sounds more like ports every day
2006-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	maybe they should just merge with pkgsrc
2006-09-23T07:22:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	see I m one that doesn't like gentoo do to their developing practices
2006-09-23T07:23:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	oh i find the idea of gentoo was sound enough, it just wasn't executed with a lot of professional rigor.  configuration management is punishingly hard tedious work
2006-09-23T07:24:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	I like Source Mage but I msorta biased sicne I help work on SourceMage
2006-09-23T07:25:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	it might be good but its terminology doesn't exactly help it into fortune 500 server rooms
2006-09-23T07:49:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	it's primarily for java, it does do other languages.  none of them all that well.
2006-09-23T07:49:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	well the eclipse site says it's only for java :) even though people try to have it do other things
2006-09-23T07:51:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	CDT isn't on their project page
2006-09-23T07:53:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	eclipse has a lot of pages.  their site is rather confusing
2006-10-27T06:57:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	it's has fawn in it's name
2006-10-27T06:58:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	i hereby designate it "funky fawn"
2006-11-11T09:26:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	umm oracle is closer to RHEL
2006-11-11T09:26:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	it's also not free.  half price, yes, but not free
2006-11-11T09:26:00.000Z	kitche	sproingie	umm you can download oracle unbreakable for free what costs money is the support
2006-11-11T09:27:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	"support" means downloading updates
2006-11-11T09:28:00.000Z	sproingie	kitche	not being able to use up2date makes a RH distribution hard to work with
