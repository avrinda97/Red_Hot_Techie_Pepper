2004-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	Parisi		2.8!
2004-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	Parisi		Thats one reason i wanted to ditch Mepis off my second partition, not really a big fan of KDE
2004-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	Parisi		And it just seens KDE centric, like most distros these days anyways.
2004-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	Parisi		With the exception of Fedora
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	Parisi		Excuse my poor english at the moment btw, brb.
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	Parisi		How stable is this anyways?
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		Anyone here actually running it as a desktop OS ?
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		haha, how do you like it.
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		I wonder how well it will play with my picky hardware.
2004-09-27T13:21:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	on all my desktops :)
2004-09-27T13:29:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	we're working on 'totally rad' laptop support for ubuntu :)
2004-09-27T13:29:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	lots of which is in warty, some will have to wait for hoary
2004-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	open computer > desktop preferences > keyboard shortcuts
2004-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	choose one of them that maps to one of your funny keys, like volume up/down or whatever
2004-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	and hit the right button
2004-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	we have great support for most acpi implementations
2004-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	but some require a bit of kernel work and so on
2004-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	for instance, my X300 doesn't think it has batteries :)
2004-09-28T08:34:00.000Z	Parisi	jdub	thats harsh, another reason to use XP
2004-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	depends on what's important to you, of course. but linux moves faster than any other os on issues like this. we'll get there.
2004-09-29T12:51:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	powernowd :)
2004-10-05T06:13:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	no, it's normal
2005-09-08T16:48:00.000Z	jdub	Parisi	their own
