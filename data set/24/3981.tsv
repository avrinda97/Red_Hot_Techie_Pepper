2007-12-28T10:34:00.000Z	KlrSpz		any network/bridge gurus? I'm trying to bridge a NIC to a wireless USB device... I've tried using ubuntu's bridging which seems to initialize the hardware fine (and i can still connect to the net) but the network traffic is not properly routing... anything i'm missing? the route table seems right with everything on eth0 routing to wlan0
2007-12-28T10:34:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	what commands did you use to make the bridge?
2007-12-28T10:37:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	i used the /etc/network/interfaces file to bridge, then restarted the networking... ifconfig shows the two devices having their own ip's, and dstat shows the nic getting packets from the 360 just fine.. but isn't routing to wlan0... i know my hardware is capable as i've had bridging working in windows... but i had to set a promiscuous mode in windows which i can't find a valid way to do it in ubuntu. not sure if htis is m
2007-12-28T10:37:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	can you paste the output of that file to pastebin please?
2007-12-28T10:38:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	if the bridge is up, then the only device to get an IP is the bridge interface itself
2007-12-28T10:40:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	yeah i'm actually not on the box, was just looking for insight... and yeah, i mis-spoke.. i meant that ifconfig showed both being up; with only br0 having an IP (i can't remember if it was my internal subnet, or the subnet for the bridged devices)
2007-12-28T10:40:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	it's basically like each network card is a hand, and when you bridge them, you're taking a very large mitton and placing it over both hands at once to keep them warm at the same time - the outside world doesn't see the hands, it just sees the mitton, therefore the only way to put an IP on the bridge is via the interface itself - snow and ice on the hands inside the mittons would not work, just like IP's on the main interfaces them
2007-12-28T10:41:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	ah ok - well, if you could paste the output of that file, i could certainly help better
2007-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	you're talking about the interfaces file? i'll have to check back tomorrow night.. i should be getting to bed for work in the morning :S
2007-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	are you around often?
2007-12-28T10:43:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	a bit here and there - i'm gonna be outta town the next few days, but there are plenty of networking gurus around here :)
2007-12-29T04:50:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	you around?
2007-12-29T05:08:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	you around?
2007-12-29T06:35:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	you around?
2008-08-05T20:34:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	yes, and without a lot of punctuation.
2008-08-05T20:35:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	?
2008-08-05T20:35:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	just apt-cache search wireshark
2008-08-05T20:35:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	gratzi; i couldn't remember that name for the life of me
2008-08-15T19:39:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	stop.
2008-08-15T19:40:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	being insulting.
2008-08-15T19:40:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	and what was insulting?
2008-08-15T19:41:00.000Z	Gnea	KlrSpz	well, hate speech is discouraged here. please do not do it again.
2008-08-15T19:42:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	no one is hating except you right now.. i was just stating the fact that there's a lot of ERIC* and it made it hard to type his name
2008-08-15T19:42:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Gnea	but you're not realizing he doesn't know how that's going to really affect the system
