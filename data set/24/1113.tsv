2010-07-30T18:27:00.000Z	beeman_nl		hi folks :)
2010-07-30T18:28:00.000Z	beeman_nl		i want to set Chrome as the default browser in Gnome in Ubuntu 9.10, if i do it works for that session but after i restarted my laptop it's back to using Firefox as it's default
2010-07-30T18:28:00.000Z	beeman_nl		i also tried setting it with update-alternatives but no go with that either
2010-07-30T18:29:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	This is using prefs preferred apps?
2010-07-30T18:29:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	yes indeed, and Chrome is just in the list there :)
2010-07-30T18:34:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	ret gconf-editor the key value is /desktop/gnome/applications/browser/exec
2010-07-30T18:36:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	oke, i'll check that value :)
2010-07-30T18:37:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	the correct value is there (now that i set it manually), i will check what the setting is after a reboot
2010-07-30T18:37:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	just log out then in
2010-07-30T18:39:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	i tried loggin out and in, now the default browser is back to Firefox, but the value in gconf-editor is still set to Chrome...
2010-07-30T18:43:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	is this for opening html files?
2010-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	i mainly try it by clicking links, or having my IDE open my browser for me
2010-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	IDE?
2010-07-30T18:45:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	yeah, when i run a web project in Netbeans
2010-07-30T18:45:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	after i log in both the browsers correctly see who is the default and who is not
2010-07-30T18:46:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	for links Right click and select "Properties" (not "Open with") and select the application
2010-07-30T18:47:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	once in properties use the open with tab to set the default
2010-07-30T18:47:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	there is no Properties when i rightclick a link (i'm trying on links in Terminal)
2010-07-30T18:48:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	and my .html files are set to open with gedit :)
2010-07-30T18:49:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	not at all sure then
2010-07-30T18:49:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	thanks for your time anyway :) i should upgrade to 10.04 anyway sooner or later :)
2010-07-30T18:50:00.000Z	philinux	beeman_nl	one last thing to try. Try going to Preferred Application, and choose Custom on write this:/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser %s
2010-07-30T18:50:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	i tried setting one manually before but no go, but i'll try it again :)
2010-07-30T18:52:00.000Z	beeman_nl	philinux	nope, still seeing firefox as default... i guess i'll leave it for now, thanks for you help :)
