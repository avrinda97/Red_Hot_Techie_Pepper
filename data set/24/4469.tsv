2007-11-25T23:34:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	pretty simple looking guide, and this will allow me to share a hard drive over the network? From a linux comp to a windows comp, will it work wirelessly? My windows desktop connects to my network through wi-fi
2007-11-25T23:34:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	do you want to mount a windows disk in Ubuntu, or the other way around?
2007-11-25T23:35:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	it's just an external hard drive
2007-11-25T23:35:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	but where is it attached? to your windows PC or your Ubuntu PC?
2007-11-25T23:35:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	it will be hooked up to my ubuntu pc
2007-11-25T23:36:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	you'll need to install a samba server and configure a share that points to the disk's mount-point
2007-11-25T23:36:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	basically, you'll need to do a bit of reading on samba :)
2007-11-25T23:36:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	it's not tricky
2007-11-25T23:36:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	reading isn't too hard, getting use to it i suppose
2007-11-25T23:36:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	haha.  welcome to linux.
2007-11-25T23:37:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	ya it shouldn't be too hard, will it be able to connect through wi-fi?
2007-11-25T23:37:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	ha ya right on, been using ubuntu since 7.04 came out, not too long but i'm still a noob i'd say
2007-11-25T23:37:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	if both computers are on the same network, then sure.
2007-11-25T23:37:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	they will be, awesome
2007-11-25T23:38:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	it's just information.  the fact that you're using wired connections or wireless connections doesn't matter from samba's point of view -- all it knows is that there's a network
2007-11-25T23:38:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	awesome, i like that
2007-11-25T23:38:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	does NFS work the same way?
2007-11-25T23:38:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	it had better :)
2007-11-25T23:39:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	well i know it doesn't connect to windows pc, that's why i'm having to use Samba
2007-11-25T23:39:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	oh, i see what you're saying.  not sure about NFS, having made only light use of it.  i think that you need to flip a switch in windows to enable an NFS server or something
2007-11-25T23:40:00.000Z	dfcarney		!nfs
2007-11-25T23:40:00.000Z	foug	dfcarney	i see, thanks for the help
2007-11-25T23:41:00.000Z	dfcarney	foug	no problem...and good luck.
