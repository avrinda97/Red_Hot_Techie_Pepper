2010-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	Are you sure you aren't receiving many copies of the same email, and the deletion has nothing to do with the new arrival?  (Sorry, it's the best I can come up with.)
2010-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	I don't think it's a NEW email, I think it's the old email due to the time stamps being the same.
2010-11-05T08:41:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	How are you deleting, then?
2010-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	I select them and hit delete, or I right click them and select delete message - both do the same thing.
2010-11-05T08:45:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	Have you always had this problem with deletions, or is it new?
2010-11-05T08:45:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	new, because I moved from thunderbird to evolution.
2010-11-05T08:48:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	Do you have "view deleted messages" selected or not?
2010-11-05T08:48:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	where at, under "view" itself in the top of the menu?
2010-11-05T08:49:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	yes, there.
2010-11-05T08:55:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	In the meantime, what version of evo?
2010-11-05T08:55:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	2.30 I believe. its with 10.10
2010-11-05T08:57:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	ok, I'm on 2.28 (10.4).  I like where hesham is going, but I can't find that setting on mine yet....
2010-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	Do you have any filters defined?
2010-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	nothing I set up separately.
2010-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	careful -- pop has a subset of the features of imap.  You might be disappointed.
2010-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	I really dont see what "features" I would be missing out on. I just want my email to send/receive/delete :P
2010-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	:-)  Got it.
2010-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	Which provider?
2010-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	comcast is my ISP, gmail is the email I'm using.
2010-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	(Sorry for following -- not a gmail user) So you're using IMAP to gmail, which is fetching mail from comcast?  Rather than accessing comcast imap directly?
2010-11-05T09:17:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	iirc, IMAP pulls down headers without needing to pull down mail body.  With POP it's all or nothing.
2010-11-05T09:17:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	aha!
2010-11-05T09:19:00.000Z	roasted	poohstix	whats the downside of "all or nothing?"
2010-11-05T09:20:00.000Z	poohstix	roasted	main downside is bandwidth.  If you've got lots, no downside.  I still live in a 2400 baud world in my tiny little brain, sometimes.
