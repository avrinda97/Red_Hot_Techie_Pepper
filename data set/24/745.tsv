2011-02-20T23:37:00.000Z	simisu	Starminn	i have finished installing ubuntu and am trying to change stuff in firefox but there is no Options in the menue
2011-02-20T23:38:00.000Z	simisu	Starminn	it´s just not where it´s supposed to be and i can´t locate it anywhere in the manues, any idea what happend to the Options?
2011-02-20T23:39:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	To my knowledge there never was an "Options" menu. I believe you are looking for "Edit->Preferences"
2011-02-20T23:42:00.000Z	simisu	Starminn	thanks i found it... i know that on my windows it has Options so !shrug! thanks thoguh
2011-02-20T23:43:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	You probably weren't using the same version. Windows doesn't have it either for the same version.
2011-02-20T23:44:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	The one on Ubuntu (as far as I know) is Firefox 3.6 or newer. What you were running on WIndows was likely older than 3.6. I looked up screenshots to make sure and they were as I remembered.
2011-02-20T23:44:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	Then again, I run Firefox 4 Beta on both Windows and Ubuntu, so... :)
2011-02-20T23:45:00.000Z	simisu	Starminn	thank you!
2011-02-20T23:50:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	I supppose. Not very familiar with this program so I'm not sure. :) I'd say so or something close to it. Just use whichever you prefer.
2011-02-21T00:14:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	You remember .zip files on Windows?
2011-02-21T00:15:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	.tar.gz is similar to those. It's a type of compressed file.
2011-02-21T00:15:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	The command "cd" means "Change directory" and exists in Windows as well. So "Change directory to where you installed the .tar.gz" means in the Terminal type in "cd /path/to/the/tar.gz/folder
2011-02-21T00:16:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	All without quotes of course. So you're just moving yourself to the folder where you downloaded it to (which would probably be your Downloads folder in your Home directory. (i.e. ~/Downloads)
2011-02-21T00:16:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	There you go. :)
2011-02-21T00:20:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	This helped me considerably: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/cli.html
2011-02-21T00:21:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	And hear's a quick-and-dirty vocab: http://brajeshwar.com/2008/linux-vocabulary/
2011-02-21T00:22:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	That pretty much sums it all up. The rest of things yeah you'll just learn with time. Like that .tar, .gz, and .tar.gz are the equivalent of .zip, .rar, etc. in Windows.
2011-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	Allow me to just say that my system came with XP Media Center (highest) and 512MB DDR2 RAM. Running UBuntu was at LEAST 4 times faster than XP. Now that I have 5GB of RAM XP is actually usable. -- IT's probably not Ubuntu, it's just the RAM.  What they're saying though is that Ubuntu has some variations on it for lighter machines. Xubuntu looks like Ubuntu but is a lot lighter/easier on the machine.

2011-02-21T01:54:00.000Z	simisu	Starminn	but it could also be the fact that it´s running throguh usb no?
2011-02-21T01:54:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	Oh, you mean you have'nt installed it yet?
2011-02-21T01:55:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	That will definitely slow it down. Remember that until you install it the only thing you're using is the speed of the external device. So on a CD it's going to run only as fast as your CD drive can read (which usually isn't very fast) and on USB it's as fast as your computer can read the flash drive.
2011-02-21T01:56:00.000Z	Starminn	simisu	It's not installed on your computer is what I'm saying so it will run about half as fast as it would if installed.
