2007-09-17T13:09:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		imaging takes more time
2007-09-17T13:10:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		imagine if u have a 160Gb HDD
2007-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		for example, u delete or modify a file, then u go back and the file is as if never touched
2007-09-17T13:13:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		and where do the programs store their settings in Ubuntu? is there such a problem as junk entries in windows registry?
2007-09-17T13:14:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		so everything is the same as in windows :)
2007-09-17T13:16:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		what I mean is, after uninstalling a program - does it leave junk in files or some registry-like place?
2007-09-17T13:18:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		so there is an option to "purge"?
2007-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		but windows also has "one" place for software settings  -HKLM/Software ot HKU/Software, but still programs write to many other places too
2007-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		in linux programs write only to one place?
2007-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		I am installing ubuntu now, why does it say smth like "checksum for device 1 is bad.."?
2007-09-17T13:23:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	Bad burn on CD - did you run the check cd for defects thingie...
2007-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	Well, i dunno - like how anything else can be bad, I suppose. Evil spirits :)
2007-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	Yes and it'll say if it found any errors..
2007-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	At least it eliminates the most likely problem..
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	- are you installng on Virtual PC by any chance?
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	ShackJack	yeah, how did u know?
2007-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	Just googled it... try *lower* allocated memory to 256MB - you'll get error but it should continue...

2007-09-17T13:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	sorry, no  just read it somewhere in ubuntu forums

2007-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	I have Ubuntu running with "Windows as the guest OS running on VirtualBox - runs real sweet...

2007-09-17T13:42:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	ShackJack	I want to stay in Windows untill I learn ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	_SiLENT_	P.S. They have VirtualBox for Windows hosts to (virtualbox.org) which I'm using (linux version) and runs real well...
