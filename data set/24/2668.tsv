2008-11-27T18:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Ohh I see thanks... thought that was a one time setting
2009-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	Try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub
2009-04-07T13:06:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	I have not installed Windows. I just got a system update in ubuntu.
2010-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	by 'take back', do you mean delete?
2010-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	kinda... I filed it but actually I was caused by another lib I had from a bloody ppa
2010-07-23T15:50:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Or mayby simply comment it so if anyone encounters the situation it will be there for reference?
2010-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	But then I guess some of the people will have to close it
2010-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	you can mark it as Invalid
2010-07-23T15:51:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	do you know how to do that, or do you want instructions, or do you want to give the bug number and I'll do it for you?
2010-07-23T15:52:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	It would be nice to learn how to do it if I can do it myself.
2010-07-23T15:52:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Also I'm interested to know: so in this case the bug is invalid right?
2010-07-23T15:53:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	right, it's invalid because it's not actually a bug in Ubuntu, it's a PPA library messup
2010-07-23T15:53:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Ok so how would I mark it invalid?
2010-07-23T15:54:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Guess it might be useful for reference to others googling though, so invalid would be goud vs deleting?
2010-07-23T15:54:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	look near the top of the bug report page, at the Affects/Status/Importance/etc. table. Under "Status", it should have the current status and (assuming you're logged in) a yellow circle. Click that, then click Invalid on the box that pops up.
2010-07-23T15:54:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	you can't actually delete bug reports, so...
2010-07-23T15:55:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Oh ok it's already marked as invalid
2010-07-23T15:55:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	I can see a point in not deleting them even if invalid
2010-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Been marked as invalid by someone already
2010-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	lorenzosu	rww	Thank you very much for your helop
2010-07-23T15:56:00.000Z	rww	lorenzosu	alright, you should be all set then
