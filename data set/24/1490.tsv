2009-12-21T15:51:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	OK, well, I still can't find a way to pull it up anywhere, and running it in term floods me with more info than I can make sense of.

2009-12-21T15:59:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	Still nowhere to be found, even after doing the install for hardinfo via synaptics
2009-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	TopCat	Daughain	just type it in terminal now hardinfo
2009-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	TopCat	Daughain	its so detailed, you will probably cry
2009-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	Ok, got it now. =) And, that may be, but hopefully it wil tel me wtf this HDMI crap I got on here is, and mebbe I can find some drivers for it.
2009-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	TopCat	Daughain	aahhdmi ?
2009-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	TopCat	Daughain	what is hdmi really, i just got a ATI 4850 card and dont know how to get that sound output
2009-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	Yup, Gateway w/HDMI. Been having driver issues with it since I got this damn thing.
2009-12-21T16:05:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	Been having vid issues since I got this thing, and, have no clue what the hardware actually is.
2009-12-21T16:12:00.000Z	Daughain	TopCat	Thanks. Think I am going to reinstall anyway. Too much BS since I did the upgrade. Mebbe frsh install wil solve some of them.
