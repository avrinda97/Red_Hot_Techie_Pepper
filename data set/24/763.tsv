2011-02-23T03:20:00.000Z	Jonii		I'm struggling to find how to run testdisk :/
2011-02-23T03:21:00.000Z	Jonii		The suggested command to run it doesn't work
2011-02-23T03:22:00.000Z	Jonii		that sudo testdisk-6.9/linux/testdisk_static
2011-02-23T03:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	try typing "man testdisk" and it should show you a manpage with what options you have to run it
2011-03-06T22:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ibus
2011-03-06T22:16:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	please note that the page there is not even remotely related to anything I've asked or said :<
2011-03-06T22:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	sorry
2012-07-25T21:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	been solid for me
2012-07-25T21:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	installed much since?
2012-07-25T21:08:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	maybe 2 months
2012-07-25T21:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	so its been 2 months since you installed anything?
2012-07-25T21:09:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	oh, misunderstood
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	gnome do? is that in the repos?
2012-07-25T21:10:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	I think it was
2012-07-25T21:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	you using unity?
2012-07-25T21:11:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	yeah
2012-07-25T21:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	i'm not sure gnome-do is meant to work with unity
2012-07-25T21:12:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	seems to work just fine
2012-07-25T21:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	if you fancy testing you could remove it and see what performance is like for a while without it
2012-07-25T21:14:00.000Z	Jonii	ThinkT510	I just recently installed it, I haven't had any new problems after installing it, just the same old
2012-07-25T21:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	i always thought gnome-do was only for gnome-shell
2012-07-25T21:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	oh
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	installed any ppas?
2012-07-25T21:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Jonii	you can't remember what you've installed?
