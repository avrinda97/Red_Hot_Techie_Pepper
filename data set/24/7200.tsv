2006-10-01T11:36:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		!lame
2006-10-01T11:36:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		Ok what i don't understand is, is it possible to get into my mp3 files from bash?
2006-10-01T11:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		so i can use lame to convert them into mp3?
2006-10-01T11:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		!bash
2006-10-01T11:38:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		Anyone?
2006-10-01T11:39:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		I don't know how I'm suppose to use lame if I can't even get into my mp3's to change them?!?
2006-10-01T11:40:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	what do you mean "get into" them?
2006-10-01T11:40:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	yes, from the command line. What do you mean "get into" them?
2006-10-01T11:41:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	did you delete them?
2006-10-01T11:41:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	is there a space after the word the?
2006-10-01T11:42:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	I do not know. I am asking you.
2006-10-01T11:43:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	why don't you try replacing the spaces in the names with underscores? Bash does not handle spaces very well in all circumstances.
2006-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	yes, have you replaced the spaces with underscores?
2006-10-01T11:44:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	and has the error message changed?
2006-10-01T11:46:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	perhaps you have the case wrong? Capital "T" vs "t"?
2006-10-01T11:47:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	of course you can. The error you seem to be getting says that bash cannot recognize the file/path you are typing in.
2006-10-01T11:48:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	what is the command you are typing in?
2006-10-01T11:49:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	so you type in "cd ~/Desktop/hdb1/Musak/"?
2006-10-01T11:50:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	and it says that it cannot find "The"?
2006-10-01T11:50:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	since there is no "The" in that command, I think you may be confused about what you are typing in.
2006-10-01T11:51:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	well, it's been fun, but I have to go now.
2006-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	I thought that you had changed the name of that folder to "The_Bled".
2006-10-01T12:01:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	I thought that you had changed the name of that folder to "The_Bled".
2006-10-01T12:01:00.000Z	conner	Sktfeelsdapper	no, you said that you changed it when I suggested that you replace the spaces with underscores.
