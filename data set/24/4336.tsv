2007-05-05T06:05:00.000Z	lbawinowns		Hello. Please, does anybody succesfully removed files from ntfs drive? When I do no space get freed
2007-05-05T06:06:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	there's a few common ways to try, are you referring to the write support in vanilla kernel ntfs driver?
2007-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	I dont know what kernel is, but all I want is to delete files from my ntfs drive. It is like no space is getting freed
2007-05-05T06:07:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	oh.   ntfs access is typically read-only
2007-05-05T06:08:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	: i got ntfs-3g
2007-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	it works sometimes, but I must do the shift-delete
2007-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	uh.   oh god, you're using the GUI
2007-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	what is GUI?
2007-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	"recycle bin" or whatever it's called
2007-05-05T06:09:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	empty that
2007-05-05T06:10:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	yea, I thought so to, but it's empty
2007-05-05T06:10:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	at least the one to down right
2007-05-05T06:10:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	sorry mate, i'm one of those glow-in-the-dark cave crawling hackers that operates by typing in all commands, I shun use of the mouse :P
2007-05-05T06:10:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	welcome to the fray! :)
2007-05-05T06:11:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	^^ aha ok, I'm new to ubuntu :D, getting scared of the word kernel
2007-05-05T06:12:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	kernel means "core" or "central group of functionality",  most computer uses of the word kernel refer to a bit of functionality that all other computer software integrates with
2007-05-05T06:12:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	anyway, can you hack with the terminal to see where all those file I delted went? It's no in the recycle vin :-/
2007-05-05T06:12:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	it's like if my partition has it's own recycle bin
2007-05-05T06:14:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	I don't know.   on my system, which is not Ubuntu, there's a Gnome based "recycle bin" in ~/.Trash   (Places | Home Folder,  press control key + 'l', type in ~/.Trash)
2007-05-05T06:24:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	you're asking a nice well thought out question, sorry that things scroll by so fast
2007-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	lbawinowns	jnc	and too bad replyers aint really replying :p
2007-05-05T06:25:00.000Z	jnc	lbawinowns	if you'd like to pick my brain, I'm 12 years + using GNU/Linux based OS distros... drop me a privmsg
