2012-03-25T20:18:00.000Z	htmlgifted	rileyp	wireless
2012-03-25T20:20:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	 yes google your laptop and the word wireless and  the word ubuntu and see if you get a heap of hits
2012-03-25T20:21:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	 because if its happening to you uts porbably happend to someone else wit the same laptop
2012-03-25T20:23:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	so your wireless disconnects all by itself and then wont rejoin unless you remove it and re add it
2012-03-25T20:25:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	does it normally have very good strength
2012-03-25T20:26:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	or only weak?   Is a cordless phone killing your wireless network?
2012-03-25T20:41:00.000Z	rileyp	htmlgifted	 its not something like the ip address is being issued to another machine and then when it tries to recconect the ip has been used
2012-03-25T20:43:00.000Z	htmlgifted	rileyp	no...
