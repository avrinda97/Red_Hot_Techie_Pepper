2007-10-13T14:22:00.000Z	megamanx		I was previously using OSS but just decided to move to alsa, so I installed alsa-base, alsa-utils, alsa-tools... but there' no alsaconf! How can I configure ALSA to use my sound card (I have 2 and I want it to use my YAMAHA sound card)
2007-10-13T14:23:00.000Z	megamanx		ubotu
2007-10-13T14:23:00.000Z	megamanx		that's a bot right?
2007-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	megamanx		look !sound won't help me, it is not an issue with GNOME and besides I use KDE... all I need is to configure ALSA to use a specific sound card in my system.. I have already looked all over Google but can't find an answer... is it much asked to get guided a little bit? Why doesn't Ubuntu have alsaconf in the first place is annoying me! In Debian all I did was to alsaconf >:-|
