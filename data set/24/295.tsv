2012-08-10T10:53:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 http://www.ralinktech.com/en/04_support/license.php?sn=5000
2012-08-10T10:54:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	you can give some fake name + email
2012-08-10T10:54:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	May take a second
2012-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	Am I going to have to have winrar for this thing or is it self extracting?
2012-08-10T10:59:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 hopefully its self extracting
2012-08-10T11:00:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	Guess we'll see.
2012-08-10T11:00:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	How big is this file anyways?
2012-08-10T11:03:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	ah okay we're getting close then. about 10 to go
2012-08-10T11:05:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 sorry didn't mean to cause so much trouble, i didn't know your internet connection is slow
2012-08-10T11:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	It's okay. Guess I need winrar too though
2012-08-10T11:08:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	Need to install this thing or what?
2012-08-10T11:09:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 can you just db click, i am hoping its a self extracting archive
2012-08-10T11:10:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	It's not. But, TJ- Has the exe oped up already. Tell TJ- What you want.
2012-08-10T11:21:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	Are you absolutely sure there is not already firmware for your device?
2012-08-10T11:22:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	yeah i tried using the rt2800pci module, it does not work
2012-08-10T11:23:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 i am trying ndiswrapper as last resort
2012-08-10T11:23:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	i saw some people posting the same problem but no real solution
2012-08-10T11:23:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	So you can scan for access points and see them but you cannot associate? Did you try changing the encryption type on the router to isolate that as a possible issue?
2012-08-10T11:24:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 actually no, i just had it on wpa, never tried wep
2012-08-10T11:24:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	At least you would be able to make sure that wasn't an issue
2012-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	tao_	bobo37773	 yeah i should try that. but i should get the file from TJ- also, since he is doing so much work on that
2012-08-10T11:45:00.000Z	bobo37773	tao_	No problem. Hope you sort out your problem. I still think finding out what is wrong with the inline firmware is a better solution though
