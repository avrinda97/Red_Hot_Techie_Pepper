2008-03-23T19:11:00.000Z	Pendeta		After installing KDE on a Ubuntu server, the server will no longer boot normally (it can however be booted in recovery mode). Trying to boot normally results in a blank screen with the cursor blinking in the upper left hand corner. Is there any way to fix this? This is with an encrypted lvn file system.
2008-03-23T19:11:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	what is the graphics card?
2008-03-23T19:12:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	I don't know. I'll find out and report back.
2008-03-23T19:13:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	but I had Kubuntu workstation installed before, and all worked fine.
2008-03-23T19:14:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	well I've seen that happen with my nvidia card when the kernel upgraded and I had to reinstall the driver
2008-03-23T19:15:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	how do I reinstall the driver. I'm brand now to Linux, only been using it for a few months.
2008-03-23T19:15:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	depends on the graphics card ;)
2008-03-23T19:16:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	ok. I'll find out and report back.
2008-03-23T19:28:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	the video card is built into the motherboard, which is an Asus P5GC-MX.
2008-03-23T19:28:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	intel I guess?
2008-03-23T19:29:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	yes.
2008-03-23T19:29:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	I don't know, I've only seen that with the binary nvidia drivers... you could try reconfiguring xorg
2008-03-23T19:30:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	...which is done with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-03-23T19:32:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	ok. I'll try that.
2008-03-23T19:38:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	I get a message saying "x-server-xorg is not installed" because the file doesn't exist.
2008-03-23T19:39:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	there's your problem...
2008-03-23T19:39:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	er it's xserver-xorg... not x-server
2008-03-23T19:41:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	also before that I noticed that several line under "Loading AppArmor profiles" there is a line that says, "*Setting sensor limits...  [fail}"
2008-03-23T19:45:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	is there any way to install xserver-xorg besides using aptitude?
2008-03-23T19:46:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	are you sure it isn't installed? it looks like you issued the command wrong.
2008-03-23T19:46:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	how did you install KDE exactly?
2008-03-23T19:50:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	under Uninstalled Packages in aptitude there is a choice for x11. But it is not able to install gwenview for some reason.
2008-03-23T19:51:00.000Z	skarface	Pendeta	okay? I don't really have time to continue
2008-03-23T19:52:00.000Z	Pendeta	skarface	ok. Thanks for your time so far. I appreciate it much.
