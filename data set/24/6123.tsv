2006-01-09T08:25:00.000Z	Dariuss		is it possible anyone in here can help me with an install?
2006-01-09T08:26:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Sure.
2006-01-09T08:28:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	- im really new to linux, but i got it to install on my amd64 system, now im trying to install it on my hp laptop. everytime i try though, it fails. initrd tools wont install....
2006-01-09T08:30:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Can you pass the noapic option to the installer?
2006-01-09T08:31:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Try this, linux vga=771 noapic nolapic acpi=off
2006-01-09T08:31:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	this is where the whole 'being new' thing comes into play....
2006-01-09T08:32:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 No problem bro, when the CD boots and it presents a input-prompt put in "linux vga=771 noapic nolapic acpi=off" minus the quotes.
2006-01-09T08:33:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	oh, ok, so where it says to type in server for the base system...
2006-01-09T08:33:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Yeah

2006-01-09T08:35:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 No problem man, glad I could help.
2006-01-09T08:37:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Is the option line I gave you working now?  If so, sweet :)
2006-01-09T08:39:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	still loading up...
2006-01-09T08:39:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Cool, but you're further along than before, right?
2006-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	now, it should still do a complete install, right?
2006-01-09T08:40:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Yes sir.
2006-01-09T08:56:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	sorry to bother you, but it didnt work. still says its unable to install initrd-tools
2006-01-09T08:59:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 My suggestions didn't help?
2006-01-09T08:59:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	no, still gave me the same error...dont know what to do. could it be a hardware issue?
2006-01-09T09:00:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Let me guess, you installed successfully right, ejected CD, and upon reboot you got that, right?
2006-01-09T09:00:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	no, during the initial install.
2006-01-09T09:01:00.000Z	evilghost	Dariuss	 Oh, hmm, try Ubuntu Forums searching on your specific machine type.
2006-01-09T09:01:00.000Z	Dariuss	evilghost	ok, thanks for the help
