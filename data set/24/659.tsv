2011-07-21T12:44:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	first thing is to see what windows you have and what partition it uses
2011-07-21T12:45:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	fat or ntfs?
2011-07-21T12:47:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	line 206 and following in your grub.cfg paste
2011-07-21T12:48:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	i dont know
2011-07-21T12:49:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	these lines where added manually. no ubuntu program would have added them. run "file -s /dev/sda1"

2011-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	have you tried to mount /dev/sda1?
2011-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	or checked if it's mounted already?
2011-07-21T13:23:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	mount: can't find /dev/sda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2011-07-21T13:23:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	then mount it manually
2011-07-21T13:24:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	how could i mount it manually hmm im kinda new
2011-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
2011-07-21T13:26:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	: i did mounted it but still same message
2011-07-21T13:28:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	and after you mounted it, what does "mount" say? the question is, if your XP partition is really a FAT partition
2011-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	its fat32 http://paste.ubuntu.com/648948/
2011-07-21T13:30:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	I said "mount" for a reason and NOT fdisk
2011-07-21T13:30:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	i did mounted it and it didnt give me any message
2011-07-21T13:31:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	if you run "mount" it will give you some output
2011-07-21T13:31:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	:mount: according to mtab, /dev/sda1 is already mounted on /mnt
2011-07-21T13:31:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	run the EXACT command: "mount". no more no less
2011-07-21T13:32:00.000Z	Noor_egy	wols_	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/648950/ sorry for misunderstood
2011-07-21T13:34:00.000Z	wols_	Noor_egy	grub errors when it tries to treat your XP partition as FAT32 for some reason or other. my guess was it's actually NTFS but apparently I was wrong :(
