2007-02-11T12:54:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 what can't be pinged?
2007-02-11T12:54:00.000Z	Psy	unop	the router
2007-02-11T12:54:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 has the wireless interface got an IP address
2007-02-11T12:56:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 is the IP address static or via DHCP ?
2007-02-11T12:59:00.000Z	Psy	unop	it's static, subnet mask is correct
2007-02-11T12:59:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 ahh, but is the gateway correct tho?
2007-02-11T13:00:00.000Z	unop	Psy	ifconfig doesnt list it -- you need  route -n  for that
2007-02-11T13:01:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 and 10.0.0.61 is the address of your router, right?
2007-02-11T13:01:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 can i ask why you arent using DHCP ?
2007-02-11T13:02:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 eh? how many other systems ?
2007-02-11T13:03:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 but if you configure the DHCP server right, you can ensure that the server always gets the same IP address .. and if its a server, its quite likely to relinquish the lease .. so i dont see that as much of an issue
2007-02-11T13:04:00.000Z	Psy	unop	i know it an be done - but my dad prefers it static - not much i can do there :)
2007-02-11T13:04:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 anyway .. for the sakes of troubleshooting this .. try DHCP out.. you can always revert back if it's successful
2007-02-11T13:05:00.000Z	Psy	unop	- that would involve taking the network down - not an option unfortunately :(
2007-02-11T13:05:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 you dont need to add a new route -- as the same exists already
2007-02-11T13:06:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 taking what network down ?? it's just re-enabling your wireless interface
2007-02-11T13:12:00.000Z	unop	Psy	what does this return -- iwlist wlan0 scan
2007-02-11T13:12:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 replace wlan0 there with your wireless interface's
2007-02-11T13:14:00.000Z	unop	Psy	ok .. how does iwlist fare with your wireless interface? can you show us the result .. use a !pastebin
2007-02-11T14:07:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 it could happen if the wired connection has an IP address that has a default gateway as the same router
2007-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	Psy	unop	would it detect the channel automatically?
2007-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 well the fact that you can see the network when you scan suggests so .. but to be sure -- iwconfig
2007-02-17T08:35:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 users .. user<tab, tab> :)
2007-02-17T08:36:00.000Z	unop	Psy	 perl -F/:/ -ane '$\=$"; print $F[0] ' /etc/passwd
