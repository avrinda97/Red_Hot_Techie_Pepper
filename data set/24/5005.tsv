2006-11-17T08:10:00.000Z	david_		Hello every one I am new to ubuntu and wanted to introduce myself
2006-11-17T08:10:00.000Z	david_		could I ask for some help with qtparted?
2006-11-17T08:11:00.000Z	rasman	david_	hey david
2006-11-17T08:12:00.000Z	rasman	david_	I'm more familiar with gparted
2006-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	rasman	david_	what happens when you start qtparted?
2006-11-17T08:14:00.000Z	rasman	david_	run the command as 'sudo qtparted' to elevate your priviledges
2006-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	rasman	david_	terminal or press F2 and type it in there
2006-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	rasman	david_	gparted has a shortcut to sudo gparted listed under 'System --> Administration'
2006-11-17T08:16:00.000Z	rasman	david_	what errors?
2006-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	rasman	david_	that may be due to a device that is plugged in but not recognizable
2006-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	rasman	david_	can you format the drive?
2006-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	david_	rasman	I am trying to delete the partitions but won't allow me says it is mounted
2006-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	rasman	david_	careful, you may be looking at your system drives.  But more than likely, ubuntu automatically mounted the drive.
2006-11-17T08:21:00.000Z	rasman	david_	run 'df -h' to see what is mounted and how much space is left on the drives
2006-11-17T08:23:00.000Z	rasman	david_	you can run 'sudo umount /dev/hd<tab>' to unmount whatever drive
2006-11-17T08:23:00.000Z	rasman	david_	but you said it was sata so it would likely be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2
2006-11-17T08:25:00.000Z	rasman	david_	definately 'umount /dev/sda1' :)
2006-11-17T08:25:00.000Z	rasman	david_	definately 'sudo umount /dev/sda1'
2006-11-17T08:27:00.000Z	rasman	david_	after unmounting it?
2006-11-17T08:28:00.000Z	rasman	david_	you might want to close qtparted first and then umount the sda1 drive
2006-11-17T08:28:00.000Z	rasman	david_	don't worry... this stuff just takes time getting used to it
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	david_	rasman	thanks a bunch at least I have a starting point
2006-11-17T08:29:00.000Z	rasman	david_	I'm learning xchat today
2006-11-17T08:33:00.000Z	david_	rasman	thanks a million
