2006-11-15T11:48:00.000Z	VR_		should 5GB be enough for my / partition?
2006-11-15T11:49:00.000Z	VR_		mmhm
2006-11-15T11:49:00.000Z	VR_		well, i'll need more space for home. got all my stuff...
2006-11-15T11:49:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	I personally have 63gig for everything, but htats just me :P
2006-11-15T11:50:00.000Z	VR_		another question: does it matter in which order the partitions are created? i see some people have /, swap, then /home, etc.
2006-11-15T11:50:00.000Z	VR_		ok
2006-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	I have my / partition, then swap, but i have some NTFS before that too :P
2006-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	VR_	lsproc	yeah, i have 60GB to spread out, but im not really sure how to divide it up
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	VR_		er, i mean, i have 60GB in total, just not sure how to divide it up
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	10 gig for root, 5 gig for swap, 10 gig for home, 5 gig for /boot (which is wasteful), and rest for /usr
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	lsproc		thats reccomended, but i have
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	VR_		5 gig swap!?
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	VR_		haha
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	lsproc		60 gig for / and 3 gig for swap:P
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	lsproc		handy if you do a lot of junk like me :P
2006-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	VR_		my swap is like 1 gig
2006-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	VR_		btw, why do i need a separate /boot?
2006-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	VR_		mmmhm
2006-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	Plus you can keep your grub stuff in case of reinstall
2006-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	VR_		2gb is enough for swap, right?
2006-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	VR_		oh ok
2006-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	Old rule of thumb was double the installed
2006-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	VR_		how about the new
2006-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	lsproc	VR_	There isnt one, I just use that (goes back to days of RedHat 9)
