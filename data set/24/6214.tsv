2006-05-16T10:38:00.000Z	PPJJ		i CANNOT get ubuntu to work on this pc..omg.
2006-05-16T10:38:00.000Z	PPJJ		anyone ever had it install completely, modules etc, then just sit at a grey underscore that doesnt flash after boot?
2006-05-16T10:38:00.000Z	PPJJ		it goes through the entire typical proces then sits at _
2006-05-16T10:39:00.000Z	PPJJ		i can run in recovery mode, thats about it
2006-05-16T10:39:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	so it's a fresh install?
2006-05-16T10:43:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	what happens when you boot it normally and then when the underscore appears, hit ctrl-alt-F1 to switch to a virtual terminal
2006-05-16T10:43:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	it kind of just sounds like an xorg problem to me
2006-05-16T10:44:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	then you can go about fixing your xorg.conf
2006-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	it's just an xorg problem then.
2006-05-16T10:48:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	log in as your user as specified in the install process.
2006-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	obviously you can't use a graphical editor like gedit when you're not running X
2006-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	use nano or vi
2006-05-16T11:00:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	and remember use sudo when editing it
2006-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	it's /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	is that what file you're editing?
2006-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	i'm going to have to ask you to double check
2006-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	on ext3, capitalisation matters.
2006-05-16T11:03:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	:q! to quit without saving, ZZ to quit with saving
2006-05-16T11:03:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	if you dont know how to use vi then use nano
2006-05-16T11:06:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	you might just want to try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg instead of manually editing your xorg.conf
2006-05-16T11:06:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	well i dont know your exact setup
2006-05-16T11:07:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	if you have two cards then ubuntu is perhaps trying to use the other card
2006-05-16T11:09:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	no.
2006-05-16T11:13:00.000Z	eobanb_	PPJJ	the open source ones, yes.
