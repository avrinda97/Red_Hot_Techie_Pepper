2005-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	ahh, how to enable then?
2005-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	the printer tool in gnome has everything you need, but if you urgently want, add the user cups runs under to the shadow group....and enable the web access in the cups.conf file
2005-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	the printer tool in gnome segfaults
2005-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	kcontrolcenter basically does the same thing as soon as I try to auth to admin mode
2005-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	hmm, i hadn no probs so far with 4 different network printers and 3 directly connected ones (1 parallel)
2005-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	eh, any idea how to enable this?
2005-01-07T06:46:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	sudo adduser cupsys shadow
2005-01-07T06:47:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	will be enough
2005-01-07T06:47:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	thx
2005-01-07T06:47:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	and sudo /etc/init.d/cupysy restart

2005-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	was from there: /usr/share/doc/cupsys/README.Debian.gz
2005-01-07T06:58:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	even rms doesnt like it
2005-01-07T07:00:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	if you didnt fiddle around in your cups.conf, the things described in the doc should just work
2005-01-07T07:01:00.000Z	ogra	gloin	has the printer a powersave option switched on ?
2005-01-07T07:02:00.000Z	gloin	ogra	it's a cheap inkjet
