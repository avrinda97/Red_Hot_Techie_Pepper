2008-03-22T07:17:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	what's you vid card?
2008-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	you are probably going to have to edit the xorg.conf manually.
2008-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	Control / Alt + Fkeys (Don't remember the virtual terminal keys) does nothing.
2008-03-22T07:27:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	when you restart your machine do it in recovery mode and run sudo nano -w etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-03-22T07:29:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	Okay, changed it from fglrx to ati. Restarting and crossing fingers
2008-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	A slight improvement. It now boots to a text only login
2008-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	that's not all...
2008-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	you should make sure default depth is 24
2008-03-22T07:31:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	you should add virtual size of 1024 x 768
2008-03-22T07:31:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	It is set to 24. Virtual size?
2008-03-22T07:33:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	add the line virtual 1024 768
2008-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	I see the Virtual command on the xorg documentation. It's not clear what it does, and setting it / trying to start Xorg did nothing.
2008-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	add it in the "display" section?
2008-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	Yes I did
2008-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	It's dying with no screens found
2008-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	below the default depth it lists out modes. leave 1024x768 and 800x600
2008-03-22T07:38:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	They are still there. The log simply says "Fatal server error: no screens found"
2008-03-22T07:38:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	I have a generic xorg I'll send you. what kind of monitor do youhave?
2008-03-22T07:39:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	It's an Acer AL22W. 22 inch 16:10 LCD
2008-03-22T07:39:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	what pci port is the ati card on?
2008-03-22T07:40:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	PCI:1:0:0
2008-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	I'm sending you that xorg
2008-03-22T07:48:00.000Z	sensae	efirewic2	Alright, though I'm at a loss as to how to get it over there
2008-03-22T07:49:00.000Z	efirewic2	sensae	at least try and compare it, a few things were thrown in generic but it should work with your card...
