2005-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	JeremyM		vnc2swf looks cool, I'm trying it now
2005-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	you may have to get a specific libming, ask me if you have any troubles. There's a short instruction on ubuntuforums.org
2005-06-23T11:53:00.000Z	JeremyM	xy77	any way you could msg me the URL?
2005-06-23T11:53:00.000Z	JeremyM	xy77	I'll msg you the exact error, copied right from SSH, as soon as I get VNC installed again
2005-06-23T11:54:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	there aren't too many vnc2swf threads on ubuntuforums.org, but check this one: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=36464&highlight=vnc2swf
2005-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	wget will probably too, but it's not a browser actually.
2005-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	it's apt-get install package in general.
2005-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the ones listed on ubuntuguide.org
2005-06-23T12:13:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	if you have a firewall installed, it may be an issue.
2005-06-23T12:15:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	my vnc.conf is empty
2005-06-23T12:16:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	you will have to use the commandline commands.
2005-06-23T12:16:00.000Z	JeremyM	xy77	how do you have it setup?
2005-06-23T12:16:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	did you try vncserver
2005-06-23T12:17:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	try apt-get install vncserver
2005-06-23T12:18:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	ps ax | grep -i vnc
2005-06-23T12:19:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	then you should be able to connect to it.
2005-06-23T12:20:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	did you enter a password?
2005-06-23T12:21:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	tried root pwd? you should check whether port 5900 is open
2005-06-23T12:22:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	you have to consider the network configuration, routers, firewalls, etc.
2005-06-23T12:29:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	what was the problem?
2005-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	apt-cache search samba
2005-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	and then apt-get install <any-samba-packages>
2005-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	xy77	JeremyM	cdrom mounted?
