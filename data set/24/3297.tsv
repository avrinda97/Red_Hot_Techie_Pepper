2008-03-20T14:59:00.000Z	Finnish		I still don't know how to exactly manually partition my laptop HD during Ubuntu installation
2008-03-20T15:00:00.000Z	Finnish		What file type must I choose for Ubuntu?
2008-03-20T15:01:00.000Z	Finnish		Ok. And I mount the new ext3-partition to "/"?
2008-03-20T15:02:00.000Z	KemrinH	Finnish	have one partition of 100-500mb in swap format. Have two more in ext3, one should be around 5000mb, and be mounted to /, the other should be the rest of your free space, and be mounted to /home
2008-03-20T15:02:00.000Z	KemrinH		does that help?
2008-03-20T15:03:00.000Z	Finnish		Aargh, that exceeds the partition number amount
2008-03-20T15:03:00.000Z	KemrinH		Hey, I have a CIF Single chip webcam; it doesn't seem to work. I don't have experience with webcames, were should I start?

2008-03-20T15:04:00.000Z	KemrinH		Why would you need more than 4? What are you doing to your hard disk Finnish?
2008-03-20T15:04:00.000Z	KemrinH		unless...
2008-03-20T15:04:00.000Z	Finnish		I wan't my Ubuntu on top of windows
2008-03-20T15:04:00.000Z	KemrinH		a triple boot would be pretty cool ^_^

2008-03-20T15:05:00.000Z	KemrinH		What windows system needs 3 partitions?
2008-03-20T15:05:00.000Z	KemrinH		Windows naturally exists in 1...
2008-03-20T15:06:00.000Z	Finnish		hda1 is 5gb, hda2 50gb and hda3 50gb
2008-03-20T15:06:00.000Z	Finnish		Windows has C-drive and D-drive
2008-03-20T15:07:00.000Z	Finnish		D-drive is a storage-drive
2008-03-20T15:07:00.000Z	Finnish		Aargh
2008-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	KemrinH		I'm back. Finnish, I don't understand why windows needs a storage partition. Why doesn't your windows exist in a single partition like a normal windows?
2008-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	KemrinH		If the answer is "for no reason" then you should change is so that it has only the one partition; and spend the other three on linux, which naturally exists in 2-3 partitions.
2008-03-20T15:09:00.000Z	Finnish	KemrinH	Yeah, it's kinda stupid, but that's how it is in that laptop
