2008-06-29T17:02:00.000Z	ackbahr		Hi! is there a way to force Ubunut to have normal users and one superuser who can sudo?
2008-06-29T17:03:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 thats how it normally works.
2008-06-29T17:03:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 the first user you make is the sudo-able user. rest are normal nosudo users
2008-06-29T17:03:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	Well, actually no; I tried sud-ing from a terminal with a normal user, and I can't do it;
2008-06-29T17:04:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 any users after the 1st shouldent be able to sudo.
2008-06-29T17:05:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	But sudo is precisely to say "It's a normal session, but now it's root for a few minutes at the keyboard, please allow me do power stuff"!
2008-06-29T17:06:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	  only the first added user has rights to run 'sudo' , any user added after that cant normally do any sudo things.
2008-06-29T17:07:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	Can't i change that? I had the feeling some other distribs allow this.... Like in "sudo -u username" (that actually doesn't do anything in Ubuntu)?
2008-06-29T17:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 you just asked how to make sure the other users could NOT do sudo.. if you want tthem to be able to sudo. you need to enable that feature for them. i dont rember how. :)
2008-06-29T17:10:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	Is there a channel dedicated to accounts management and all this kind of thingS?
2008-06-29T17:18:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 i would say read up on sudo - thers dosens of pages that discuss its ins and outs and configuration.
2008-06-29T17:19:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	I'm doing this right as we speak.... I think I start to find something about this!
2008-06-29T17:40:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 in a terminal, you can login to a different user if you wanted to.
2008-06-29T17:41:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 but it can get confusing
2008-06-29T17:30:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	I found the sudo -i command, but it asked me for the user's password, not root's....
2008-06-29T17:30:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 yes.. thats how it works...
2008-06-29T17:30:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 there is no root password..
2008-06-29T17:34:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 if you run sudo as a non-sudor user. it will proberly ask for a password. then fail.
2008-06-29T17:34:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	Exactly what it does. And exactly what I don't find logical
2008-06-29T17:35:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	  the fact that it would fail 'befor' it asked for the password - would be considered a security issue.
2008-06-29T17:35:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 perhaps this way - the 'hackor' that may be trying to break in.. dosent know if why it failed.. bad password.. or invalid user.
2008-06-29T17:41:00.000Z	ackbahr	dr_Willis	especially if what you want to do is X....
2008-06-29T17:42:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 with sudo you can setup where specific users can do specific Root-ish type tasks also..  once ya learn how sudo works.
2008-06-29T17:51:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ackbahr	 exactly
