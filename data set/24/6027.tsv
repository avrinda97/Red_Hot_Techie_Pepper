2007-03-16T09:36:00.000Z	quietFrank		hi all ... Im running a fresh install of edgy and have a dell widescreen monitor which I am having trouble configuring. I have 915resolution installed and its not listing my resolution
2007-03-16T09:36:00.000Z	quietFrank		I have tried most of the things in the forums and all seem to result in a broken x
2007-03-16T09:36:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 I'm not able to achieve my monitor's optimum resolution either.  Sometimes we just have to deal with what we're given.  :)
2007-03-16T09:37:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	really, its pretty badly stretched
2007-03-16T09:37:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 what resolution is it running currently?
2007-03-16T09:38:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 fresh install?  have you `sudo apt-get upgrade` 'ed yet?
2007-03-16T09:40:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	I have tried the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but it just broke x :)
2007-03-16T09:41:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 you're working with a fresh install of Edgy right?
2007-03-16T09:42:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 has your fresh install gone through it's "automatic update" yet, to your knowledge?
2007-03-16T09:43:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	yep
2007-03-16T09:44:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 what video card are you using?
2007-03-16T09:46:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	umm that where im not so sure how do I find out ?
2007-03-16T09:47:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 there's a command to display the video card only, but I cannot remember it.  Pastebin the output of the command `lspci` for me.  do you know how to use pastebin?
2007-03-16T09:48:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	just looked at the device manager says Intel 82865G Integrated graphics controlor
2007-03-16T09:48:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	its a dell box
2007-03-16T09:49:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 excellent.  and when your reconfigured the Xserver, you selected one of the drivers that began with "i", correct?  Like i810, or something?
2007-03-16T09:49:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	yep
2007-03-16T09:49:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	i810
2007-03-16T09:52:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 not really sure.  are other resolutions just as stretched?
2007-03-16T09:53:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	yeah ... if I edit xorg.conf and only have the 1680x1050 it just gives an error screen
2007-03-16T09:53:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	thanks for your help, will keep playing
2007-03-16T09:54:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 what about selecting someting like 1280x760 (or thereabouts). Does that lead to a stretched screen?
2007-03-16T09:54:00.000Z	quietFrank	billy	will try that too
2007-03-16T09:55:00.000Z	billy	quietFrank	 i can't achieve my best resolution either and I too have a widescreen and a i810 driver.  Hmmm.........
