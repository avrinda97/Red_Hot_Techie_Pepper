2007-09-18T09:48:00.000Z	HHP22		Hey guys, I was wondering if someone could answer a question I had about transfering files across two computers in the same room.. or if anyone could direct me to the proper channel?
2007-09-18T09:49:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	over what medium?
2007-09-18T09:52:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	Transfering 556 MB of Music files from one computer to another when both are hooked up to a wired router.
2007-09-18T09:53:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	take your pick, scp, ftp, samba, etc etc :)
2007-09-18T09:53:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	I don't know how to use any of those :(
2007-09-18T09:53:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	I'm being a noob and trying to transfer it through an IM client. :P
2007-09-18T09:54:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	what operating systems?
2007-09-18T09:54:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	XP on source and Ubuntu on Destination
2007-09-18T09:55:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	install ssh on the ubuntu (sudo apt-get install ssh) then download winscp on the windows box. When you open winscp you will just enter the IP of the ubuntu box and your user/pass and you will see the folders on the ubuntu box. After that its drag and drop. Probably the least steps aproach
2007-09-18T09:57:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	Sounds simple enough. Thank you :)
2007-09-18T09:57:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	np, good luck
2007-09-18T09:59:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	Can I get the terminal to output the IP of the computer with a certain command?
2007-09-18T10:00:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	ifconfig
2007-09-18T10:01:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	And the IP that I'm using is the local (192.168) or the network for that computer?
2007-09-18T10:02:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	the local. the one rite after "address" for the eth0 most likely
2007-09-18T10:02:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	Okay. Thanks so much for all your help :D
2007-09-18T10:02:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	no problem :)
2007-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	It's working!!
2007-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	cool :)
2007-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	This will be really useful later on, thanks so much :)
2007-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	no problem it isn't the fastest way but it is pretty reliable
2007-09-18T10:05:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	And it's easy, which is nice for a nooblet like me :P
2007-09-18T10:05:00.000Z	acecase	HHP22	thank Ubuntu devs for that. They do a great job setting up ssh with no extra config needed
2007-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	HHP22	acecase	I can tell.. it just does its job right out of the box
