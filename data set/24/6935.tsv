2005-06-09T12:54:00.000Z	eliteforce		does anybody know if there's a utility (no not vim, nano etc. :) ) for configuring the whole! xorg config file?

2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	eliteforce	marky	yes, but this path stands in the manual entry for xorg.conf
2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	eliteforce		so what did u read?
2005-06-09T12:59:00.000Z	marky	eliteforce	i've search in this file, and find VertRefresh
