2006-06-12T08:45:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	cant resolve, update fails?
2006-06-12T08:46:00.000Z	xeon3d		SurfnKid,
2006-06-12T08:46:00.000Z	xeon3d		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15583
2006-06-12T08:46:00.000Z	xeon3d		that's the error it gives me.
2006-06-12T08:48:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	I just want to erase that list.. and I managed to erase some already
2006-06-12T08:48:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	ok hang on
2006-06-12T08:48:00.000Z	xeon3d		but there are still some packages left
2006-06-12T08:48:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	erase it? so how are you going to update
2006-06-12T08:49:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	I tried to install some packages with dpkg that didn't work out alright.
2006-06-12T08:49:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	none of them were installed but somehow they managed to stay on apt-get list...
2006-06-12T08:49:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	so now I just want apt-get to forget that I tried to install them.
2006-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	 oh i see, dont know what to do there :/
2006-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	mine was failing to update-upgrade forever
2006-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	its a big problem with synaptic /behind routers
2006-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	i thought you were having the same problem
2006-06-12T08:50:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	my problem has nothing to do with routers...
2006-06-12T08:51:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	those packages are marked by apt-get to be installed and I just want to unmark them.
2006-06-12T08:51:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	i know, mine is, but i thought initially your apt-get question had something to do with mine
2006-06-12T08:51:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	oh ... ok. :)
2006-06-12T08:51:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	oh erase those only, i see, how did you do it
2006-06-12T08:52:00.000Z	xeon3d	SurfnKid	I could remove some... by doing sudo dpkg -r package-name...
2006-06-12T08:53:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	so maybe its just tedious :P
2006-06-12T08:53:00.000Z	xeon3d		can anyone help me make apt-get forget some packages?
2006-06-12T08:53:00.000Z	SurfnKid	xeon3d	brb i have to reconnect my modem
