2008-05-03T07:52:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	no and ther's clam and clamgtk
2008-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	don't install any strange package
2008-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	what do you mean strange?
2008-05-03T07:54:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	things that aren't in the repos or you don't know the source is safe
2008-05-03T07:55:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	ok man..I got it
2008-05-03T07:55:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	say like getdeb.net, that's pretty ok ;)
2008-05-03T07:56:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	if you're paranoid check things out every once in a while with netstat -ntl  or namap to see any strange network thing running
2008-05-03T07:57:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	ok guy..hey...o you know about java configuration at ubuntu?
2008-05-03T07:58:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	for developing, sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jdk , for regular use, sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin
2008-05-03T07:59:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	the problem is that when I use  "java -version" i get java 1.6, but i want to use java 1.5
2008-05-03T07:59:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	I changed the path already..but it didn't work
2008-05-03T07:59:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	that's sun-java5-jre
2008-05-03T08:00:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	install that, then sudo update-alternatives --config java
2008-05-03T08:00:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	 or check out galternative/galternatives ,whichever is the correct spelling
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	I'll think more about..maybe i don't need to go back to java 1.5
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	either one ought to let you choose the config java that's running
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	alternatives? how?
2008-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	install that, then sudo update-alternatives --config java <<
2008-05-03T08:02:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	 or check out galternative/galternatives ,whichever is the correct spelling
2008-05-03T08:03:00.000Z	gleyve	jackfruit	very cool...it worked :)
2008-05-03T08:04:00.000Z	jackfruit	gleyve	np
