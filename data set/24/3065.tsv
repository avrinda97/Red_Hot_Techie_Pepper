2008-05-06T03:43:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	can u help me friend
2008-05-06T03:44:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	to do what?
2008-05-06T03:46:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	i am newbie on this, i need your help coz i want to make high the voice sound of a film
2008-05-06T03:47:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	do you mean just play it a bit louder, or actually boost the db's of the sound component?
2008-05-06T03:48:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	yes i play it and the sound very low :(
2008-05-06T03:49:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	so how do you know the file itself isn't recorded too low?
2008-05-06T03:51:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	but is there a program to make the film very high sound?
2008-05-06T03:52:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	yeah it's ffmpeg - there are other, but it's cli and hard to explain better than the manual - I found the manual very good though
2008-05-06T03:52:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	which one?
2008-05-06T03:53:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	I would recommend ffmpeg - it's a transcoder among other things
2008-05-06T03:53:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	as i told you u have to help newbies people?
2008-05-06T03:53:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	it''s more of aswiss army knife really it does loads of different stuff
2008-05-06T03:55:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	hang on I'll look - it's not something I've actually done so I will have to read as I go
2008-05-06T03:56:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	ok thanx :)
2008-05-06T03:57:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	first of all you have to install ffmpeg ffmpeg2theora gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libxine1-ffmpeg using aptitude
2008-05-06T03:58:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	or the synaptic package manager if you prefer
2008-05-06T04:02:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	ok i am downloading them, after that what should i do
2008-05-06T04:04:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	well as I remember you type ffmpeg -h and it comes up with loads of help - I printed that - I suggest you do so and then work from it
2008-05-06T04:07:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	i need your help :) , just help me how to make the movie very high sound, and then i gave u the path where i have the movie,/home/hendaus/.wine/drive_c/1_2/VIDEO_TS/
2008-05-06T04:08:00.000Z	respaol	NiceIce	I think you ought to ask in the #ffmpeg channel - they are a lot more expert than me and besides it's bedtime here in the UK :)
2008-05-06T04:09:00.000Z	NiceIce	respaol	:( ok
