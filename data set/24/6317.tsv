2006-09-18T15:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	cd
2006-09-18T15:38:00.000Z	briguyd	eyequeue	why?
2006-09-18T15:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	because you need to reboot to have the new kernel take effect
2006-09-18T15:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	today, and security patches, multiple
2006-09-18T15:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	"27" in the package name
2006-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	briguyd	eyequeue	it'll get you addicted to filesharing and slowly kill you with lawsuits
2006-09-20T10:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	for login, !/.bash_profile
2006-09-20T10:16:00.000Z	briguyd	eyequeue	just add the command to the end of that file?
2006-09-20T10:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	or anywhere in the sequence you want it.  the file is a bash script basically, so use that syntax
2006-09-20T10:17:00.000Z	briguyd	eyequeue	what syntax?
2006-09-20T10:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	any thing you would add to a bash script :)  /usr/bin/foo --some --things /here  maybe :)
2006-09-20T10:20:00.000Z	briguyd	eyequeue	but if i just add a command to the end, it'll run?
2006-09-20T10:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	presuming it's something bash can decipher.  be sure to use /full/path/to/app too
2006-09-20T10:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	briguyd	and nothing interactive, like sudo asking you for a password :)
