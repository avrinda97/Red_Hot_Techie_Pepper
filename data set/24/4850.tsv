2006-12-31T13:56:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	errr, do you get sound doing cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp?
2006-12-31T13:56:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	none at all. and no errors
2006-12-31T13:56:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	what about cat /dev/dsp ?
2006-12-31T13:57:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	yes, i get sound from "cat /dev/dsp"
2006-12-31T13:58:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	you get sound by doing cat /dev/dsp ???? wtf?
2006-12-31T13:59:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	i mean i hear sound when i get that...
2006-12-31T13:59:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	type*
2006-12-31T14:00:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	weird, you should only get some output characters...
2006-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	when i type that i hear beeping.
2006-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	beep from the speaker in your internal computer?
2006-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	also: sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/dsp bs=1024 count=2 tells me it worked, but i dont hear anything.
2006-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	no beep from my speaker.
2006-12-31T14:02:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	what does lspci | grep audio says?
2006-12-31T14:03:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	that should work with the emu2k1 module or something.
2006-12-31T14:04:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	huh?
2006-12-31T14:04:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	better ask in #alsa if that card is supported by them.
2006-12-31T14:05:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	im sure it is
2006-12-31T14:05:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	the card that i am using is audigy 2 zs. my sound is perfect all except in cs:s
2006-12-31T14:05:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	is your mixer unmuted?
2006-12-31T14:05:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	oh, better say that.
2006-12-31T14:05:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	then is a wine configuration problem
2006-12-31T14:06:00.000Z	olsen	Siv0x	you need to change something in ~/.wine/config, in the sound part. i don't use wine, so try in #winehq
2006-12-31T14:08:00.000Z	Siv0x	olsen	they told me to get ALSAs OSS Emulater setup, and to test cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp - when i got sound from that, then to make sure i have OSS and Driver Emulater Checked in winecfg.
