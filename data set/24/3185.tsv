2008-04-11T06:10:00.000Z	gligorhoria_		the system seems to crach whenever i remove my usb stick...
2008-04-11T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 unmount it first.
2008-04-11T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 hmm.. i would go over the /etc/fstab file and be sure you dont have something mounting the wrong devices
2008-04-11T06:13:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	ok i will do that and see...
2008-04-11T06:13:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	could the swap be on the flash, by mistake?
2008-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 possible.
2008-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 somthing sounds very weird going on  the way you describe it.
2008-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	:D ok i will output it for u
2008-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	http://codepad.org/QFUSLvwz
2008-04-11T06:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 what device is your usb stick normally? I see no mention of it in the fstab.  so that dont look like the issue.
2008-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i think it is fd0
2008-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	w8 let me see something brb
2008-04-11T06:19:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i have no floppy disk if that helps. it-s unpluged, i checked!
2008-04-11T06:19:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i think that is the problem brb
2008-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 possibally. remove that line in the fstab file.
2008-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 but i doubt if thats the issue.
2008-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i read something aboute that, brb i will feed u back
2008-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i got it, as you said i have to put # in front of fd0 in fstab for it to work, it's a known issue on systems with no floppy :)) yey!
2008-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 I have no systems with floppies..i got noidea how that entry even got in the fstab. :)
2008-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gligorhoria_	 however i DO have the floppy controller disabled in the bios. that might be why i dont have the issue
2008-04-11T06:24:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	:(( give me hope
2008-04-11T06:25:00.000Z	gligorhoria_	Dr_willis	i'll do a restart now, if i'm not back in 3 minutes call the fun police!
