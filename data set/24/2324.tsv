2009-01-28T01:47:00.000Z	sheldonh_		been googling to try get my iwl3945-based wlan card to see my home network (sometimes i see a random neighbour, sometimes none). is there hope?
2009-01-28T01:47:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	i have the same card, no problems here

2009-01-28T01:48:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	dang. you in the usa?
2009-01-28T01:49:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	yes, why?
2009-01-28T01:49:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	might be a regional thing. i noticed it configured for us, whereas on debian sid (where it works), it was za
2009-01-28T01:49:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	so maybe i've just forgotten about something i tweaked somewhere
2009-01-28T01:53:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	thanks, that's been helpful. means i should hack on. if you have a moment, i'd love to see your: dmesg | grep iwl3945.*Linux
2009-01-28T01:54:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	sure, give a second

2009-01-28T01:55:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	okay, so it's gotta come down to a regional quirk
2009-01-28T01:55:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	thanks, i'll see if i can remember how to zone the thing correctly
2009-01-28T01:56:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	if you get it sorted, let me know what the problem was

2009-01-28T02:02:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	looks like two separate problems. 2.6.27 breaks support in iwl3945 for channels >11 (i was using 13), and you need to specify regional settings with a cfg80211 bootparam

2009-01-28T02:02:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	ahh
2009-01-28T02:02:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	brb, gonna test
2009-01-28T02:05:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	confirmed. didn't have to play with the regdom, just changing channel was enough. how do i nominate this for inclusion in the release errata?
2009-01-28T02:06:00.000Z	ezerhoden	sheldonh_	i have no idea, sorry
2009-01-28T02:06:00.000Z	sheldonh_	ezerhoden	no worries, tomorrow is another day :)
