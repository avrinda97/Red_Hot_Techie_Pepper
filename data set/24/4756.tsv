2007-02-18T09:21:00.000Z	unity		hi, i just installed ubuntu desktop but i wanted to install ubuntu server (server install cd's were not available at the time), how can i transform ubuntu desktop into server? e.g. i want to take many things out of the startup list that i don't need
2007-02-18T09:21:00.000Z	unity		uninstalling xorg is not a priority
2007-02-18T09:22:00.000Z	unop	unity	 was that kubuntu or ubuntu?
2007-02-18T09:22:00.000Z	unity	unop	ubuntu
2007-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	unity	unop	like on gentoo, i would do "rc-update remove gdm default" to stop the welcome screen
2007-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	unity	unop	not sure what the equivalent on ubuntu is
2007-02-18T09:23:00.000Z	unop	unity	 you can follow the instructions here on remove gnome totally - http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde - i'd suggest removing the xorg packages too with this command  sudo aptitude remove $(aptitude search xorg | cut -c 3-30 | xargs)
2007-02-18T09:24:00.000Z	unop	unity	 ohh err, so you want to disable the GUI boot, is that all??
2007-02-18T09:25:00.000Z	unity	unop	rather than deleting them, just taking them out of the default init runlevel should be enough
2007-02-18T09:25:00.000Z	unop	unity	 on debian/ubuntu the command is "update-rc.d" -- it can be used to disable gdm too
2007-02-18T09:25:00.000Z	unity	unop	and i might come back asking what else i can disable, like setting console font for example
2007-02-18T09:26:00.000Z	unop	unity	 errm, not if you disable just the gdm from the runlevels no
2007-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	unop	unity	 for i in $(seq 1 6); do echo this is runlevel $i; ls -l /etc/rc$i.d/S*; done
2007-02-18T11:12:00.000Z	unity	unop	thanks
2007-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	unop	unity	 the thing is almost all runlevels are the same on debian/ubuntu -- with the exception of 1, 6 and S
2007-02-18T11:14:00.000Z	unop	unity	 unless you change services at each runlevel - processing runlevel 2 is enough - ls -l /etc/rc2.d/S*
2007-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	unity	unop	and to get the list of all available scripts that i can add, i would ls /etc/init.d, right?
2007-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	unop	unity	 indeed
2007-02-18T11:16:00.000Z	unop	unity	 if you are enabling and disabling services manually -- the right way to go is update-rc.d
2007-02-18T11:17:00.000Z	unity	unop	ok, thx, and do you know where to get information about what each script is? for instance, i'm not sure what apport is
2007-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	unop	unity	 if the startup script is written right -- it should have a comment describing it's purpose at the top of the script  -- you could do    head -n 15 /etc/init.d/apport
2007-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	unity	unop	nevermind, i'll look in packages.ubuntu.com maybe
2007-02-18T11:18:00.000Z	unity	unop	oh, didn't know the scripts have descriptions, thanks
2007-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	unop	unity	 well, they ought to -- to make the life of administrators easy -- but thats really down to the author of the script
