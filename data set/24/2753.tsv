2008-09-01T06:58:00.000Z	eko1		i'm to do a command "sudo patch -p1 < 2.6.24.patch" and it's giving me permission denied even with sudo, why?
2008-09-01T06:58:00.000Z	eko1		trying*
2008-09-01T06:58:00.000Z	dres	eko1	"chmod -R +w ."  Probably don't have write set
2008-09-01T06:59:00.000Z	dres	eko1	do that in the dir you are trying to patch obviously.
2008-09-01T07:01:00.000Z	dres	eko1	using sudo?  is this on an nfs mounted filesystem?
2008-09-01T07:04:00.000Z	eko1	dres	redid it with sudo, seemed to work but then i was still denied permission for the first command
2008-09-01T07:05:00.000Z	eko1	dres	i'm on a fresh install from windows vista so maybe my hdd is ntfs still...
2008-09-01T07:06:00.000Z	dres	eko1	do "cat /proc/mounts" and look for the filesystem you are doing this on.  make sure it's "rw"  though the chmod shouldn't have worked if it weren't.
2008-09-01T07:08:00.000Z	eko1	dres	yeah it says rw
2008-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	dres	eko1	and it's ext3?
2008-09-01T07:09:00.000Z	eko1	dres	yeah ext3
2008-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	dres	eko1	can you pastebin or msg me the exact text of what happens?
2008-09-01T07:10:00.000Z	eko1	dres	sure, for which command?
2008-09-01T07:11:00.000Z	dres	eko1	the patch.  you said the chmod worked correct?
2008-09-01T07:11:00.000Z	eko1	dres	yeah one sec
2008-09-01T07:13:00.000Z	eko1	dres	http://paste.ubuntu.com/42288/
2008-09-01T07:14:00.000Z	dres	eko1	do "ls -l 2.6.24.patch"  is it readable?
2008-09-01T07:15:00.000Z	dres	eko1	lol.  that file is readable by root I bet, but not the user you are before sudoing.  try "sudo chmod 644 2.6.24.patch" and try again.
2008-09-01T07:17:00.000Z	eko1	dres	yup that worked ^^
2008-09-01T07:18:00.000Z	eko1	dres	thanks man
2008-09-01T07:18:00.000Z	dres	eko1	np.  I've done the same thing before.
2008-09-01T07:19:00.000Z	eko1	dres	so it was something with my user rights?
2008-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	dres	eko1	yea.  root (who you became after the sudo) could read the file, but the "< 2.6.24.patch" part is done as your user not root.
2008-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	eko1	dres	oh gotcha
