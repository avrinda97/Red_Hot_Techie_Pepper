2006-02-19T10:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi		I wonder if it is possible to first install Kubuntu Hoary CD and then install Ubuntu Hoary CD, so that I get both KDE/Gnome?
2006-02-19T10:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	Sure.
2006-02-19T10:46:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	hmm
2006-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	You'd probably want to just apt-get ubuntu-desktop from the disk before adding online sources, not try to do separate installs or something.
2006-02-19T10:48:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	ok will try that
2006-02-19T10:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	They run it overnight.  Or go to the library.
2006-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	library here does not have a place where you can just hook your computer up.. maybe through wifi but I bet you that they will make you pay for it
2006-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	dbernar1: Why install manually?  The CD works as an apt source.
2006-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	I have free high-speed wifi at my library, dunno about you.
2006-02-19T10:53:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	so if I install kubuntu, I change the disk to ubuntu (both Hoary), I can then simply mount the cd, change the sources.list to point to Ubuntu cd as well and then apt-get install gnome-desktop?
2006-02-19T10:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	ubuntu-desktop, but yes.
2006-02-19T10:55:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	thanks
2006-02-21T09:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	better than nothing
2006-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	For sure.  But doesn't respond well to complete sentences.
2006-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	ah well, better than copying and pasting from sites for simple little queries :)
2006-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	Yep.
2006-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	mv foo.tar.bz2 foo.tar
2006-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	That would be an issue then, yep.
2006-02-21T09:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	I think spz2 just overwrote the MBR b/c of the Windows install, so needs to write grub back to it.
2006-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	hmm well I was assuming totally full on linux install with no dualboot, etc
2006-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	Nah, broke it after putting XP on afterwards.
2006-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	heh, its supposed to be the other way round, seems like spz2 needs to get livecd to fix that up again
2006-02-21T09:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatake_kakashi	Could be, yeah.
2006-02-21T09:55:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tonyyarusso	lsof| grep apt
