2012-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	lilVaratep		Anyone know how to get TERMINATOR to BEEP?
2012-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  terminator is an irrsi app?  You should as the irrse channel -
2012-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	TERMINATOR is a terminal emulator pretty much...
2012-03-10T03:47:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  install alongside - you can kill wubi later ...
2012-03-10T03:48:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  it will be a regulare installation
2012-03-10T03:49:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  choose manual partitioning options ...
2012-03-10T03:50:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  note that a full ubuntu install requires only about 8 gigs if that much.  save some space for your /home
2012-03-10T03:50:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	yeah but im planning on transitioning out of w7 =D
2012-03-10T03:50:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	slowly though. anyways i have abundant hd space.
2012-03-10T03:50:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  suggestion: keep your /home separate from the ubuntu / root partition
2012-03-10T03:51:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	so i would have to manually make partitions? i hate that part =p
2012-03-10T03:52:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  why?  default install puts your /home under the /   If you have to reinstall our /home data gets wiped.
2012-03-10T03:52:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	do i need to create a /var and a swap partition as well?
2012-03-10T03:53:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  set a swap size - I go with 2X my ram so 8 Gigabytes ...
2012-03-10T03:53:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	how bout a /var folder like arch forces me to make?
2012-03-10T03:54:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  the only folders I manuall create are /home /swap and /  - I let ubuntu default the rest
2012-03-10T03:56:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	 save some for windows
2012-03-10T03:56:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	my windows already has 180gigs
2012-03-10T04:02:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  depends on your paranoia level
2012-03-10T04:02:00.000Z	lilVaratep	CFHowlett	so yes... lol
2012-03-10T04:04:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  painfully, probably, maybe
2012-03-10T04:09:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  aaah.  another happy customer!  :)
2012-03-10T04:10:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  what's REALLY cool is when you do an (re)installation & DON'T format your /home and get a new distro with all your data intact...
2012-03-15T09:22:00.000Z	CFHowlett	lilVaratep	  there are some 3rd party themes available but they seem to be way more trouble than they're worth.  That said, look around.  The official Lion wallpapers are online, AWN/docky will give you you dock and very mac like icons are also out there.
