2009-08-18T19:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	uhmm?   you can install program on 9.04, but not 8.10? or did you mean the other way round
2009-08-18T19:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	No I don't think so
2009-08-18T19:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	to giving out an email just like that
2009-08-18T19:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	so  you  had 9.04 on, and then downgraded to 8.10  (upgraded in certain ways :D )
2009-08-18T20:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	your  dual booting 8.10 and 9.04, or you got Windows on there as well,  by the way  how come  you still got 8.10?
2009-08-18T20:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	you can't install programs in 9.04, because the package manager is broken?
2009-08-18T20:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	that seems odd,   I   am pretty sure that 9.04  should have Chinese language support as well
2009-08-18T20:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	on the Live CD,  there are loads of languages that can be selected
2009-08-18T20:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	you can also have AWN   in 9.04
2009-08-18T20:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	I think  it's called awn-manager what you want to install into 9.04,  by the way  some people say Cairo dock is better
2009-08-18T20:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	you don't need to pm   that,   you can do your thanks and such in here
2009-08-18T20:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	I would prefer to do the Ubuntu stuff with you, in here
2009-08-18T20:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	Also a lot of the time it can be good to ask a qustion in here,   rather than pm, for differnet answers
2009-08-18T20:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	asus	I am not sure how to answer that question, so better to ask in here
