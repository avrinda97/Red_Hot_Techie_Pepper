2004-12-14T12:33:00.000Z	diesel		Is there a net install of ubuntu?  From my experience the cd install of ubuntu is COMPLETELY broken
2004-12-14T12:34:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	can you describe the bugs you've come across and file them on the bugzilla if you've found them
2004-12-14T12:35:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	hmm, where to begin.
2004-12-14T12:36:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	start at the beginning, your experience seems to have differed to most people's experience---and we'd like to fix any problems you've found as in the future somebody else may have the same problem
2004-12-14T12:37:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	okay, so this first problem (hwclock) isn't anything to do with the installer?
2004-12-14T12:39:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	you can say that it is not the installer, but until there is evidence that it is NOT the installer, I don't believe a word of that.
2004-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	I appreicate your view point.  You mentioned that the machine 'freezes', is that just for short period, or forever
2004-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	freeze, locked up, does not work, will not change for hours on end...whatever you prefer
2004-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	so you can only solve this by a reboot?
2004-12-14T12:43:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	yes...I smell something similar to windoze
2004-12-14T12:43:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	if you start up in single-user mode and run   /etc/init.d/hwclock.sh start  manually, do you get a freeze at that point?
2004-12-14T12:44:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	start up?  To what point.  The computer will not start up unless I boot from the CD
2004-12-14T12:45:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	you mentioned that the kernel and operating system are loading until the point at which hwclock is run
2004-12-14T12:45:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	when you get to the Boot-loader, select the safe/rescue option
2004-12-14T12:46:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	that is the furthest point that I got to.  After reformatting the computer and trying the install again, the kernel could never get past that point
2004-12-14T12:46:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	so the second time you've installed, the kernel never gets past /what/ point?
2004-12-14T12:47:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	trying to install linux-386, then there is dependency hell...I smell rpm packages
2004-12-14T12:48:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	Ubuntu is entirely deb based.  Can you provide the exact package you installed that is complaining of dependancy problems?
2004-12-14T12:49:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	I am aware of Ubuntu's debian foundation, but I have had much better luck with debian
2004-12-14T13:01:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	s/sucks/appears to exhibit bugs when talking to your machine/
2004-12-14T13:01:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	true enough
2004-12-14T13:04:00.000Z	sladen	diesel	so far you've described 1 issue, to do with hwclock, right?
2004-12-14T13:04:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	damn, I want to type out everything I have said.  Scroll up the page for about 3 more issues
2004-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	diesel	sladen	^^^
