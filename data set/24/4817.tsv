2007-01-13T16:47:00.000Z	ssddss		Hi, one question: i have installed apache2 in my computer but, don't know why, php files are not processed (yes, i have installed apache php module as well). Now i've delete all apache packages, reinstalled them, and now even the html welcome page doesn't work. What could be wrong?
2007-01-13T16:47:00.000Z	ssddss		(yes, i've executed apache2 restart
2007-01-13T16:47:00.000Z	ssddss		)
2007-01-13T16:49:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	have you tried lighttpd yet?
2007-01-13T16:49:00.000Z	ssddss		i said i did, sorry
2007-01-13T16:49:00.000Z	ssddss	LookTj	i'm interested in using php
2007-01-13T16:50:00.000Z	LookTj		install php5-cgi
2007-01-13T16:50:00.000Z	LookTj		for using php5
2007-01-13T16:50:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	i even wrote a howto

2007-01-13T16:50:00.000Z	ssddss	LookTj	it is already installed
2007-01-13T16:51:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	so you gonna use apache instead?
2007-01-13T16:51:00.000Z	ssddss	LookTj	well, let's see how lighttpd works, thanks for the how-to :)
2007-01-13T16:52:00.000Z	ssddss		however, it should be nice to use apache. It should work, i have installed it other times
2007-01-13T16:52:00.000Z	ssddss		in ubuntu <= breezy, fedora and other distros
2007-01-13T16:53:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	no problem.
2007-01-13T16:53:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	The only thing i haven't messed with is postfix and bind9
2007-01-13T16:54:00.000Z	ssddss	LookTj	i don't think i'll use both
2007-01-13T16:54:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	good idea
2007-01-13T16:55:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	I've tried both, so I prefer lighttpd ;)
2007-01-13T16:56:00.000Z	LookTj		Ramikassab: why would you want idle status
2007-01-13T16:57:00.000Z	LookTj		!dhcp | li`lendian
2007-01-13T16:57:00.000Z	ssddss		hey, LookTj, it works really fine, thank you :)
2007-01-13T16:57:00.000Z	LookTj	ssddss	no problem
