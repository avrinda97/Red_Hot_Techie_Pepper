2009-04-05T23:49:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	double click the select field with Desk 1, Desk 2, Desk 3 and it switches to an editable version
2009-04-05T23:50:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	That didn't work, or I'm doing it wrong.
2009-04-05T23:51:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	are you running Compiz or Metacity?
2009-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	I'm running whatever the default is for 8.10
2009-04-05T23:52:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	might have to do with that then (Compiz is default), for metacity you can even do it through gconf-editor (the names are located at /apps/metacity/workspace_names
2009-04-05T23:53:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	Let me make sure I have this straight.  Compiz is the default WM for Ubuntu 8.10, so I should do what?
2009-04-05T23:55:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	I don't know, I use Metacity. :-) Best bet is to Google around with the terms: compiz workspace names
2009-04-05T23:56:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	I will try that, but I'm really looking here for somebody that knows.  I used to be able to do this directly.  It doesn't make sense that I can't anymore.
2009-04-05T23:56:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	well, maybe you used to be using Metacity?
2009-04-05T23:57:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	That's possible, but I thought I was using 8.10 before as well.  Maybe it was a previous version.
2009-04-05T23:58:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	In any case, seems silly that Ubuntu would discontinue functionality like this, and not offer an obvious transition path.
2009-04-06T00:01:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	well, Ubuntu is a community distro (by the people, for the people), it's not a hive mind controlled by a single entity or something :-) The Compiz team was probably too busy trying to get more fancy effects then duplicate behavior from Metacity.
2009-04-06T00:02:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	I won't argue that point with you.  I understand.  I just thought that Ubuntu tried to be a convenient OS, like Windows, and from a newbie perspective (like me) this change is confusing.
2009-04-06T00:03:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	To be honest with you, I'm still not sure whether it's not a bug in my UI somehow.
2009-04-06T00:05:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	when I switch to compiz (compiz --replace) the behavior of the workspace switcher applet changes to not being able to name workspaces (or even display them). Switching back to Metacity does allow me to do so.  And then there's this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/94818 (not a bug perse, just one that shows the feature is not available when using Compiz)
2009-04-06T00:06:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	here's a more relevant bug report it seems: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libwnck/+bug/129152
2009-04-06T00:06:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	Thanks a lot, I was heading in the bug report direction.  I will look into those.
2009-04-06T00:08:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	the problem with that latter report though is that they're mixing two issues in one report (labels and number of workspaces). It's best to move the name/labels discussion to the other (closed/invalid) bug report and reopen that.
2009-04-06T00:09:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	I will try to keep that in mind.  I have a lot of other competing issues, though, so I may forget.
2009-04-06T00:09:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	Thanks for your help!  Think we've bounded the problem.
2009-04-06T01:22:00.000Z	nillo	Brucevdk	I added you as a subscriber to the bug I filed.  Sorry, I should have asked first, but forgot I still had you on IRC.
2009-04-06T01:23:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	:-) Right, well when I get too many mails I'll just unsub myself
2009-04-06T01:26:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	oh btw, you can just switch to metacity if you want right?
2009-04-06T01:27:00.000Z	Brucevdk	nillo	you just have to go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance  -> Visual effects and set it to None. Then it will switch to metacity and you'll be able to set workspace names.
