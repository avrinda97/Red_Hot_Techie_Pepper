2008-04-26T23:50:00.000Z	cellofellow		it appears that I can't write to /tmp. Why would that be?
2008-04-26T23:51:00.000Z	cellofellow		I get permission denied trying to make new files in /tmp, and that's why I can't log in with GDM. How do I fix this?
2008-04-26T23:51:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	what does mount say?
2008-04-26T23:52:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	what should it say? should there be a tmpfs thing?
2008-04-26T23:52:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	whether its rw or somethin
2008-04-26T23:53:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	mount | grep /tmp returns nothing
2008-04-26T23:53:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	you dont have gdm?
2008-04-26T23:54:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	I do, but when I log in I get errors and then I have to log out. Only thing that's working is Failsafe Terminal.

2008-04-26T23:55:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	from Failsafe Terminal gnome-session gives me an error about not being able to write a /tmp file, and then quits.
2008-04-26T23:55:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	are trying to log in as root?
2008-04-26T23:56:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	no
2008-04-26T23:56:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	error when running gnome-session: Could not open or create the file "(null)"; this indicates that there may be a problem with your configuration, as many programs will need to create files in your home directory. The error was "Failed to create file '/tmp/gconf-test-locking-file-1SACAU': Permission denied" (errno = 13).
2008-04-26T23:58:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	and I can't write files in /tmp. Sounds like that's what the problem is. How do I fix that?
2008-04-26T23:59:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	you there?
2008-04-26T23:59:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	switch to a vt, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2008-04-26T23:59:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	then try startx
2008-04-27T00:00:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	my VTs don't work. :( My geforce go 6100 and usplash make the VTs stop working.
2008-04-27T00:01:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	did u upgrade or clean install
2008-04-27T00:01:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	using Gutsy, but it was a clean install. I guess I just need to reinstall.
2008-04-27T00:02:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	clean install might be better and a lot faster
2008-04-27T00:02:00.000Z	cellofellow	tech0007	yes
2008-04-27T00:03:00.000Z	tech0007	cellofellow	good luck, u can always ask here if u need help
