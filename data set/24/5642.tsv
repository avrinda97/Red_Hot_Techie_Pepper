2007-11-26T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	FF with multiple tabs open is the most resourse consuming app in my comp,  unless java throws a fit and then frostwire eats up everyting in site
2007-11-26T05:51:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	i suppose you know about caches and alike :-)
2007-11-26T05:52:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	 :-)
2007-11-26T05:55:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	do you use java or flash a lot... did you install a lot of (possibly leaking) extensions?  how many reserved mb does firefox use?
2007-11-26T05:55:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	I have java instaled, I use flash a lot,  and I only have about 3 running extenstion most of them have to do with keeping java and flash from starting without me wanting them to
2007-11-26T06:00:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	tell me, please tell me
2007-11-26T06:00:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	i am tired anyway :)
2007-11-26T06:03:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	would you mind if i /queried you?

2008-04-19T04:19:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	would be fun ;-)
2008-04-19T04:21:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	maybe you should give him your address right away
2008-04-19T04:21:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	he can do his own research
2008-04-19T04:23:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	I have conky running and displaying cpu and mem,  it seems that it is usualy a little higher with the same stuff I have on atm
2008-04-19T04:23:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	maybe our chat just has less substance than at other times...
2008-04-19T04:24:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	likely
2008-04-19T04:26:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	you can join both channels,   #u is the one for the current release,  +1 is the one for the next one,   +1 will be closed down once hardy is official and will reopen once ipex is in alpha
2008-04-19T04:27:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	i rather wonder how this works socially... are #u and #u+1 visitors two disjoint sets of people?
2008-04-19T04:28:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	 same username,  just joined in two channel,   what are you using to chat at this moment ?
2008-04-19T04:28:00.000Z	andi5	Pelo	arrgh... i understand that technically :)
2008-04-19T04:29:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	I don'T get your quesiton then
2008-04-19T04:30:00.000Z	Pelo	andi5	ok I think I get it ,  some are just in #u , some are just in +1 , some are in both depending on what they are wantingto talk about,  I was in +1 asking for help and Iam in here giving it
