2009-04-05T09:31:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I have a lazy question.  I have a windows computer downstairs.  I run Ubuntu upstairs.  I would like to be able to remotely view the Windows Desktop to troubleshoot dumb users
2009-04-05T09:31:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		Can anyone help me in my quest to be lazy?
2009-04-05T09:32:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		thanks sebsebseb and ubottu!
2009-04-05T09:32:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I know ubottu is a bot.  It still deserves a thank you
2009-04-05T09:33:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		how true
2009-04-05T09:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	ok not what I wanted, some bots can give a heart or whatever,  and he would give you one :d for saying what you said ha ha.  ok  off topic now
2009-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	YES
2009-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	didn't want caps, anyway yeah
2009-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	cool.
2009-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	I guess you told it not to install basero  and so it' still there, but greyed out
2009-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	I did not but my CD/DVD burner is on the fritz
2009-04-24T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	  oh your going to clean install? or?
2009-04-24T01:32:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	no, this was an upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04 RC and then 9.04 released
2009-05-22T09:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	that should just work, as long as it was shut down properly by Windows
2009-05-22T09:01:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	in the partition editor, it says "Unable to read the contents of this file system"
2009-05-22T09:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	not sure, someone else is bound to be able to help
2009-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	have you ever set up a dual boot with a shared partition before?
2009-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	don't quit remember
2009-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	,but yes I done dual boot a few times
2009-05-22T09:04:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	sebsebseb	did you ever have a third partition for sharing files between Windows and Ubunut?
2009-05-22T09:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	that's for newbies
2009-05-22T09:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	sharing files with Windows eww
2009-05-22T09:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	makes more sense to have your really good files in Ubuntu, and your not so good ones in Windows.  and you  should just be able to access the Windows partition no problem as well from Ubuntu
2009-05-22T09:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	TheFunkbomb	,but yes I think I shared a data partition  at some stage between  Windows and Ubuntu
