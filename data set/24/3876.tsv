2007-10-02T06:15:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	would you recommend super grub boot disk to try to boot?
2007-10-02T06:15:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	supergrub is just the same version of grub on the live cd, so no
2007-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	except it can find bootable partition and try to boot them directly
2007-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	its already found bootable partitions in the grub install.
2007-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	the problem is his uuid's are not matching up to a physical readable partition
2007-10-02T06:37:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	he said he had two PATA's with it
2007-10-02T06:59:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	don't forget ide is now /sd$
2007-10-02T06:59:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	yeah just realized
2007-10-02T07:59:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	they are the same disk
2007-10-02T08:01:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	any idea if grub is installed on his SATA dis or PATA?
2007-10-02T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	sata sorry
2007-10-02T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	its a 140g sata disks with his windows and ubuntu partition on
2007-10-02T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	the other two idea disks are encypted
2007-10-04T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	not at all
2007-10-04T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	but its appriciated
2007-10-09T14:45:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	morning :)
2007-10-09T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	that won't return encyption protocol
2007-10-09T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	it does as your missleading someone
2007-10-09T15:50:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	it does
2007-10-09T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	sorry
2007-10-09T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	surly thats a security risk advertising encyption methods ?
2007-10-09T15:52:00.000Z	heguru	ikonia	I don't think so, one can stop ssid broadcast if they need more security though
2007-10-09T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	yes, thats a fair point
2007-10-09T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	heguru	just surprises me that it advertises the encrption protocol - so almost gives you a head start should you wish to break it
