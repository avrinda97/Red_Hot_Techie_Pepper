2005-12-19T06:04:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	is it executable?
2005-12-19T17:52:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	gdm *does* have a way to autostart stuff - but you have to fiddle with shell scripts
2005-12-19T17:54:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	should be in /etc/X11/gdm
2005-12-19T17:56:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	you should also be able to stick a .xsession shell script in your home dir
2005-12-19T17:57:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	.xsession or .Xsession?
2005-12-19T17:57:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	.xsession
2005-12-19T17:58:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	ok. Lemme see what mind is name
2005-12-19T06:03:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Nope. GDM ignores that file too
2005-12-19T06:04:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	No, no... GDM ERASES THAT FILE. WHAT IN THE WORLD? (Please pardon shouting)
2005-12-19T06:04:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	I, er........ What?
2005-12-19T06:07:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	odd
2005-12-19T06:08:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Here's what my file SHOULD be saying, in its entirety: (Pardon for paste. Not even bit enough for pastebin) exec docker -wmaker &
2005-12-19T06:08:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Formatting's a bit off, but you see what I mean, no?
2005-12-19T06:09:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	you may have to start you wm in your .xsession (I don't recall) - but it shouldn't get deleted
2005-12-19T06:10:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	wm?
2005-12-19T06:10:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	window manager
2005-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Ah... But it starts fine automatically. I've got that set in the gdm.conf file
2005-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	I said you might have to
2005-12-19T06:13:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Fair enough : )
2005-12-19T06:14:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	*tests* It may be some odd permissions thing.... Is there a way to change permissions from the comman line?
2005-12-19T06:14:00.000Z	borup	dirkson	chmod 755 ~/.xsession
2005-12-19T06:15:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Thanks
2005-12-19T06:31:00.000Z	dirkson	borup	Yup. Something is overwriting ~/.xsession every time I login. Changing the permissions, too.
