2009-05-04T21:29:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	trying...

2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	doesn't work (need more options)
2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	what packages are you having trouble with?
2009-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	http://pastebin.com/m62eefc1c
2009-05-04T21:32:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	the "previous failure" was the openJDK in the first place... why was it installed by default?
2009-05-04T21:34:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	apt-get -f install openjdk
2009-05-04T21:35:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	"couldn't find package openjdk
2009-05-04T21:36:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	apt-cache search open |grep -i jdk
2009-05-04T21:37:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	or just:  apt-cache search openjdk

2009-05-04T21:39:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	or  apt-get -f install  openjdk-6-jre
2009-05-04T21:39:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	: it's doing something that does not return an error yet
2009-05-04T21:39:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	Very good.
2009-05-04T21:40:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	yes indeed :P
2009-05-04T21:45:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	ok. it ended up with the same error
2009-05-04T21:48:00.000Z	usr13	Yanick_	Try just uninstalling it.
2009-05-04T21:48:00.000Z	Yanick_	usr13	anything I do, that has or has not any relevance to the OpenJDK, using apt-get, synaptic, or anyother package install tools return that OpenJDK returned an error... dammit
