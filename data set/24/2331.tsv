2009-02-19T13:05:00.000Z	ljungk		hi, someone here who's good at Makefiles? I'm trying to compile a program which uses a library in /usr/local/lib, but the whole '-L/path/to/lib' thing doesn't work. I get runtime complains about not finding the shared object file.
2009-02-19T13:06:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	paste Makefile and compile errors to pastebin, give me link :)
2009-02-19T13:11:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	ah, hehe, that has nothing to do with compiling I'm afraid
2009-02-19T13:11:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	does your /etc/ld.so.conf contain /usr/local/lib ?
2009-02-19T13:15:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	/etc/ld.so.conf includes the files in ld.so.conf.d. there i find libc.conf containing '/usr/local/lib'
2009-02-19T13:16:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	hmm, and if you run 'ldd <your binary here>' does it successfully resolve all lib locations?
2009-02-19T13:17:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	nope, i get: 'libcorona-1.0.2.so => not found'
2009-02-19T13:19:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	then ldconfig doesn't look into /usr/local/lib
2009-02-19T13:21:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	yes
2009-02-19T13:21:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	and how can I change this behavior?
2009-02-19T13:22:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	let's see...
2009-02-19T13:23:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	does "ldconfig -p | grep corona" see your lib/
2009-02-19T13:24:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	nope, so there is no record of where to look? that's not so good...
2009-02-19T13:26:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	ok, and if you re-run ldconfig -v (as root or with sudo) and check if it finds your lib or even looks at libs in /usr/local/lib?
2009-02-19T13:26:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	and then another stupid question but nevertheless, the libs are just in /usr/local/lib, not it a subdir, right?
2009-02-19T13:26:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	yep, I did that and now it's all fine. thank you for your help
2009-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	aha. nice. you're welcome
2009-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	is this always the case when compiling your own libraries? doesn't it automatically update itself?
2009-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	nope.
2009-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	you either need to libtool them, or run ldconfig to update caches
2009-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	ok
2009-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	once your lib filename is cached you will no longer need to update anything, it just goes about the location, not the ymbols
2009-02-19T13:29:00.000Z	ljungk	Favorit	yeah. well. good news is that THAT error is gone. bad news is now I get a seg fault. but that's probably more my own fault. :)
2009-02-19T13:39:00.000Z	Favorit	ljungk	gdb is your friend for segfaults :)
