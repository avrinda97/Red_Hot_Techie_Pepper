2012-07-28T00:52:00.000Z	b0nghitter		i used dns server during the ubuntu server install
2012-07-28T00:52:00.000Z	b0nghitter		where does ubuntu put whatever is causing it to log to rsyslogd?
2012-07-28T00:54:00.000Z	b0nghitter		as i said, i googled and it does not say how to turn it off
2012-07-28T00:54:00.000Z	b0nghitter		ther is NOTHING about logging in any of those files
2012-07-28T00:54:00.000Z	b0nghitter		no, read up
2012-07-28T00:55:00.000Z	b0nghitter		i looked through /etc/rsyslog.d/ 20-ufw.conf      50-default.conf  postfix.conf
2012-07-28T00:55:00.000Z	b0nghitter		i need to stop bind flooding my syslog with bs
2012-07-28T00:56:00.000Z	b0nghitter		those 3 files are the only ones in /etc/rsyslog.d/
2012-07-28T00:56:00.000Z	b0nghitter		its set to whatever ubuntu server 12.04 does by default
2012-07-28T00:57:00.000Z	b0nghitter		which is why im asking in here
2012-07-28T00:57:00.000Z	romy420	b0nghitter	it's in the bind config files: http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch7/logging.html
2012-07-28T00:57:00.000Z	b0nghitter		 in /var/log/syslog
2012-07-28T01:00:00.000Z	b0nghitter	romy420	the first thing i did was look through /etc/bind/named.conf, /etc/bind/named.conf.local, and /etc/bind/named.conf.options
2012-07-28T01:03:00.000Z	b0nghitter		/etc/defaults/rsyslogd only has RSYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-c5", and /etc/defaults/bind9 has RESOLVCONF=no, and OPTIONS="-u bind"
2012-07-28T01:04:00.000Z	b0nghitter		no, only /etc/defaults/bind9
2012-07-28T01:06:00.000Z	b0nghitter		its clobbering the syslog with "query (cache) 'blah.com/A/IN' denied and reverse lookups
2012-07-28T01:08:00.000Z	b0nghitter		that was one of my google results, which is where i got rndc querylog from
2012-07-28T01:09:00.000Z	romy420	b0nghitter	this page contains info for configuring bind's log level: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto
2012-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	b0nghitter	romy420	that was another one of my google results, and i looked through the named.conf named.conf.local and named.conf.options files, neither of them contain anything about logging
2012-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	b0nghitter		which i expected to see at least somewhere
2012-07-28T01:11:00.000Z	romy420		maybe u have to add it, although it should be there, that's right
2012-07-28T01:14:00.000Z	b0nghitter		ahhhhh, i guess i should have read the small print... "If no logging option is configured for the default option is: "
2012-07-28T01:15:00.000Z	b0nghitter		i have to add a logging section in named.conf.local
2012-07-28T01:15:00.000Z	romy420	b0nghitter	then i was guessing right :) just add what u need
