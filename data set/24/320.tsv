2012-02-26T06:36:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	well just use a proxy in the united stats (1 time) and login to google music
2012-02-26T06:36:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	if you want to use it ... that is
2012-02-26T06:37:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	just install xdg-utils
2012-02-26T06:37:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	it is ... in version 1.1.0 (which is > 1.0.2 imho)
2012-02-26T06:38:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	remove xdg-utils and install that particular version?
2012-02-26T06:39:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	can you tell me how I tell apt-get to install a different version?
2012-02-26T06:40:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	search the web for that particular package for ubuntu
2012-02-26T06:44:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	that's from way back 10.04
2012-02-26T06:46:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	well, don't think you have much of a choice
2012-02-26T06:46:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	moment of truth
2012-02-26T06:47:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	same error with 1.0.2
2012-02-26T06:47:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	maybe its broken google music manager
2012-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	maybe so ... do you mind giving it a try?
2012-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	i can't download it
2012-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	i'm not in the US
2012-02-26T06:50:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	isn't there a source package?
2012-02-26T06:50:00.000Z	exco	lnxslck	don't think so
2012-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	lnxslck	exco	it installed just fine
