2006-07-27T13:10:00.000Z	bl3ssing	lmh	what's your pb ?
2006-07-27T13:11:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	I try to mount an XFS-Partition, but it gives me a strange error: mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 /fileserv/foto   -   mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /fileserv/foto busy
2006-07-27T13:11:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	but it isn't mounted
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing	lmh	i thing that xfs-partition's already mounted.
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing		this is what the message's saying: BUSY~
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing		:)
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing		lmh,
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	that's what it says, but it isn't: umount /fileserv/foto umount: /fileserv/foto: not mounted
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing		try do umount first
2006-07-27T13:12:00.000Z	bl3ssing		and than remount again ... maybe'll work.
2006-07-27T13:13:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	no, it doesn't work
2006-07-27T13:13:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	mount -t xfs /dev/sda1 /fileserv/foto --> mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /fileserv/foto busy
2006-07-27T13:15:00.000Z	bl3ssing	lmh	the problem's unknown for me ... you should ask the KING OF KUBUNTU! :(
2006-07-27T13:15:00.000Z	bl3ssing		if I was you, I'll just unmount everything, and mount that "everything" again, but first the xfs partition... than the others.
2006-07-27T13:15:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	who is the king of Kubuntu?
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		who created it?
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		:)
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		lmh,
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		you got it, right?:)
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		they must know the pb for sure.
2006-07-27T13:16:00.000Z	bl3ssing		maybe's something wrong with the kernel ... so that's why I recommended you them ...
2006-07-27T13:17:00.000Z	lmh	bl3ssing	I use a XEN - Kernel, could it be connected to that?
2006-07-27T13:30:00.000Z	bl3ssing		what's the command for reintializationg my sound card driver so that I could listen again to the mms player music list?
2006-07-27T13:32:00.000Z	bl3ssing	lmh	you should try to find the connection between XEN - Kernel and XFS Partition availability!
