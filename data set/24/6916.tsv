2005-07-30T05:34:00.000Z	levander		Am I the only one ripping CD's with the paranoia options enabled in grip?  How much of a waste of time is that stuff?
2005-07-30T05:34:00.000Z	jwb	levander	i always rip with full paranoia
2005-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	jwb	levander	it's a bigger waste of time to have to do is again
2005-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	levander	jwb	and what speed does grip rip for you?  It's ripping for me at 0.1x
2005-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	jwb	levander	oh that's terrible.  i get about 16x
2005-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	jwb	levander	is dma working?
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	jwb	levander	hdparm?
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	levander	jwb	well, i ran the command to enable it, no idea if it's working or not though
2005-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	jwb	levander	yeah sometimes it doesn't enable for various reasons.  just run hdparm /dev/hdc to check it
2005-07-30T05:37:00.000Z	levander	jwb	it says "using_dma = 1 (on)"
2005-07-30T05:37:00.000Z	jwb	levander	well that was my only idea :)  is the disc scratched?
2005-07-30T05:38:00.000Z	levander	jwb	when you couldn't get dma enabled, did hdparm report it as enabled?
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	jwb	levander	no it stayed as dma = 0
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	levander	jwb	no idea, it's just been going while i've been off doing other things.  It's been more than three hours though I know.
2005-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	levander	jwb	okay, so probably I do have dma enabled.
2005-07-30T05:40:00.000Z	levander	jwb	another good idea, i'll do that after this one rips
2005-07-30T05:45:00.000Z	levander	jwb	it's just the controller integrated into my SuperMicro P6DBE motherboard.
2005-07-30T05:45:00.000Z	jwb	levander	is the piix module loaded?
2005-07-30T05:46:00.000Z	levander	jwb	piix shows up in the output of lsmod, so I guess it is.
2005-07-30T05:50:00.000Z	levander	jwb	you're on a server?
2005-07-30T05:50:00.000Z	jwb	levander	i operate a lot of servers ... that's a postgresql server
2005-07-30T05:51:00.000Z	levander	jwb	ah, i was here wondering if it made any sense to have 8GB on a desktop, but apparently, you're not using one
2005-07-30T05:53:00.000Z	jwb	levander	do you have a line like this in your dmesg?  Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
2005-07-30T05:56:00.000Z	levander	jwb	i'm ripping this cd to a network share.  Is it possible that the network is so slow that it's slowing down my rip this much?
