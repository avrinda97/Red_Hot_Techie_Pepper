2012-08-02T17:39:00.000Z	Thomas_		I'd gladly do the first one but I need to test out Ubuntu first :P
2012-08-02T17:40:00.000Z	Thomas_		I think all 500 GB are used by windows
2012-08-02T17:40:00.000Z	Thomas_		since I've never made a partition
2012-08-02T17:41:00.000Z	Thomas_		I could do all this stuff but I want to dual boot for now
2012-08-02T17:41:00.000Z	Thomas_		the details under the second option say
2012-08-02T17:42:00.000Z	Thomas_		"You can create or resize partitions yourself, or choose multiple paritions for ubuntu"
2012-08-02T17:43:00.000Z	Thomas_		that's what I don't know how to do, how to resize my NTFS partition, so I was wondering if I could find a step to step guide somewhere- google didn't help
2012-08-02T17:44:00.000Z	Thomas_		in none of these, in the Ubuntu installation CD
2012-08-02T17:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Thomas_	you can resize from gparted and reboot into windows to run chckfs

2012-08-02T17:46:00.000Z	Thomas_		I only have /dev/sda and beneath it, /dev/sda1
2012-08-02T17:47:00.000Z	Thomas_		nope, 12.04
2012-08-02T17:47:00.000Z	Thomas_		alright I clicked change and I have 3 choices : Use as, Format the partition and mount point
2012-08-02T17:48:00.000Z	Thomas_		the default option in Use as is :" do not use the partition"
2012-08-02T17:48:00.000Z	Thomas_		nope
