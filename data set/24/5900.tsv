2009-10-24T19:52:00.000Z	tesseract		how do you execute a gnome-terminal on a remote machine?
2009-10-24T19:53:00.000Z	tesseract		ooh
2009-10-24T19:53:00.000Z	tesseract		Now i have to ask the user on the other side to open a gnome-terminal..
2009-10-24T19:54:00.000Z	tesseract		I would like to start one of my own without intervention of the user.
2009-10-24T19:55:00.000Z	tesseract		"gnome-terminal -e screen --display=localhost:0" wont work.
2009-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	tesseract		Tracy_P:Bit of both.. I want to open a terminal viewable for the user on machine B. And show "my" ssh session.
2009-10-24T19:57:00.000Z	tesseract		so he/she can watch what i'm doing.
2009-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	tesseract		The idea is so simple.. :)
2009-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	use screen - it allows you to bring up a terminal session on multiple machines at the same time if you want
2009-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	tesseract		Linxeh: I try..
2009-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	tesseract		But i need a opened terminal that is running screen..
2009-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	I'm not sure I understand what you mean ?
2009-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	tesseract	linxeh	i want to remotely start gnome-terminal
2009-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	you might need to ssh into the remote box, run xterm/gnome-terminal and have that ssh back into your local machine and open the shared screen session
2009-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	tesseract		"gnome-terminal -e screen --display=localhost:0"
2009-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	tesseract		^^ like so.
2009-10-24T20:02:00.000Z	tesseract	linxeh	i will try that.
2009-10-24T20:02:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	you could alternatively get ssh set up to forward X from your local box to their remote machine and display a gnome-terminal / xterm that runs on your machine on theirs
2009-10-24T20:02:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	I'd go with the former rather than X forwarding though - less bandwidth is required
2009-10-24T20:03:00.000Z	tesseract	linxeh	You have the command for that?
2009-10-24T20:03:00.000Z	tesseract		ssh -x?
2009-10-24T20:03:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	ssh -C -Y (-C = compress, -Y is use trusted X forwarding - its usually faster)
2009-10-24T20:06:00.000Z	tesseract	linxeh	it keeps revering to the --help function..
2009-10-24T20:06:00.000Z	linxeh	tesseract	maybe you have an old ssh, try -X instead of -Y then
