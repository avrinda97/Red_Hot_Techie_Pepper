2012-10-02T20:53:00.000Z	reed	myhero	it depends on the content of the tarball
2012-10-02T20:53:00.000Z	reed	myhero	a tarball is like a zip file, it may contain a binary executable or source code that needs to be built
2012-10-02T20:55:00.000Z	myhero	reed	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gyachi/ BluesKaj this is the tarball...i want to install it....i am doing as said in the install text file but still problems
2012-10-02T21:07:00.000Z	reed	myhero	you don't need to build from source in modern systems... it's time wasted, unless you're learning how to build from source :)
2012-10-02T21:08:00.000Z	myhero	reed	i really wanna learn coz where ever you go...its not necessary that you will have deb or ppa but you will get the tarball for sure
2012-10-02T21:08:00.000Z	reed	myhero	never had to deal with a tarball since 1998
2012-10-02T21:09:00.000Z	reed	myhero	modern distributions have all the software you need :) and it comes in a very nice 'app store' fashion
2012-10-02T21:09:00.000Z	myhero	reed	problem is that apps get updated by makers and on their site with tarball but it stays outdated on repos for a long time, so its looking like everyone should have the knowledge of handling tarball
2012-10-02T21:11:00.000Z	myhero	reed	yea you are right bu this is not necessary on all occassions...like if you want winrar for ubuntu and when you go on their site then there is no deb or ppa available but what you get is tarball
2012-10-02T21:12:00.000Z	reed	myhero	that's my point, you don't need winrar
2012-10-02T21:12:00.000Z	reed	myhero	install unrar and all your rars will uncompress with the normal compress application from gnome/kde whatever
2012-10-02T21:14:00.000Z	myhero	reed	you don't need it and maybe some others too...but think in general.....i have switched from win to linux recently and i love winrar so besides i don't need it but stilli want to keep it....just feels a lil bit at home win feeling
2012-10-02T21:15:00.000Z	reed	myhero	nobody needs winrar on Ubuntu! that's my point. If it's not packaged, it's not needed because Ubuntu has its own native/better way to deal with that
2012-10-02T21:15:00.000Z	reed	myhero	I understood you switched recently, you need to learn the new way :)
2012-10-02T21:16:00.000Z	myhero	reed	yes anyways thats the whole reason behind learning tarball
2012-10-02T21:17:00.000Z	myhero	reed	winrar was just an example
2012-10-02T21:17:00.000Z	reed	myhero	tarball are *not* necessary either
2012-10-02T21:17:00.000Z	reed	myhero	you need an IRC client: xchat-gnome
2012-10-02T21:17:00.000Z	myhero	reed	means ?
2012-10-02T21:17:00.000Z	reed	myhero	if you're studying how to develop software then go ahead and start tooling with source code
2012-10-02T21:18:00.000Z	myhero	reed	why ? is this webchat not enough ? i have irssi installed
2012-10-02T21:18:00.000Z	reed	myhero	but if you just need an IRC client, a compress/uncompress for rar files, anything search in  the Software Center
2012-10-02T21:20:00.000Z	myhero	reed	ok i get your point
