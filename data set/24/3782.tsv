2008-11-22T04:24:00.000Z	b33r		some apps are using A LOT of ram what seems to be the problem?? audacious 250MB, firefox 179MB, pidgin 164MB, nautilus 133MB
2008-11-22T04:24:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	that is abnormal
2008-11-22T04:24:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	I know =0

2008-11-22T04:27:00.000Z	jotil		b33r
2008-11-22T04:27:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	restart your X
2008-11-22T04:27:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	why? :/
2008-11-22T04:28:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	seems like Xorg is causing trouble? not a big deal takes a second. save all your work. hit ctrl+alt+backspace
2008-11-22T04:29:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	isn't it better to "fix" the problem instead of restarting X every now and then :/
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	what exactly do you think is causing the memory hog?
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	I don't know -.-
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	i say restart X. start those 4 applications one by one and see what happens
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	sounds like an idea or you have something else on your mind?
2008-11-22T04:32:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	after I restart X it will work just fine but it just starts using more after few hours
2008-11-22T04:32:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	so you have been down the road already....
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	yeah but I don't want to restart every few hours :/
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	it is really difficult to say about what is causing the memory hog without monitoring
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	so there's no solution for this?
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	you will have to monitor and google,,,
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	because i have never had any memory hogging issues on Linux, i am afraid i will not be of much help
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	ok thanks anyway
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	jotil	b33r	but your Xorg seems a bit too busy for my taste. you might want to look into that.
2008-11-22T04:40:00.000Z	b33r	jotil	want me to paste my xorg configuration?
