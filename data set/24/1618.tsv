2009-11-18T09:20:00.000Z	Shwack		has anybody experienced not being able to click the giant play button in youtube videos in the middle of the video?
2009-11-18T09:21:00.000Z	Shwack		yes
2009-11-18T09:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	i noticed this problem for the first time when someone earlier sent the link http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/switch_exchange.html i'm unable to use the button in the middle as well.
2009-11-18T09:24:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  thank you very much - i'm in the process of trying to get the play button working for my friend
2009-11-18T09:24:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  I am able to click both play buttons
2009-11-18T09:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	as Arsin pointed out - if i switch to Metacity it works!
2009-11-18T09:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	lol - once i renable compiz i can click on the play button in the middle of the other video and it works!?! but once i refresh the page - not working again, very strange
2009-11-18T09:27:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-   that is strange - I tried refreshing the page and i can still click them.
2009-11-18T09:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	do you have a link to an example that isn't working for you?
2009-11-18T09:27:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  I will ask for one - one second
2009-11-18T09:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	also are you on 9.10 and what architecture 64 or i686?  what flash are you using - i'm using from restricted-extras
2009-11-18T09:28:00.000Z	Shwack		He is using 9.10 - fresh install - 64 - flashplugin-nonfree
2009-11-18T09:28:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-   sorry forgot to put your name firs t- hope you saw
2009-11-18T09:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	so same everything -- you have an example?
2009-11-18T09:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	on closer inspection I don't appear to be using "apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree" shows none installed!  the only thing I have including flash installed is flashplugin-installer.  This is what was installed by "ubuntu-restricted-extras" just after install.
2009-11-18T09:36:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  Sorry for the wait - i've asked my friend twice now for examples and he's just leaving me hanging so I'm probably gonna end up doing the same to him and just call this problem solved lol.  Thank you very much though
2009-11-18T09:36:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  If I do hear from him I'll let you know
2009-11-18T09:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	please do, i'd love to see an example (another example)
2009-11-18T09:37:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  When he told me about the problem he mentioned flash videos and all youtube videos
2009-11-18T09:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	see i'm having almost perfect flash (but not quite 100%), that disabling compiz thing is interesting.
2009-11-18T09:39:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  sudo apt-get --purge autoremove flashplugin-nonfree    and then sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree   made my flash work 100%
2009-11-18T09:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	see that's what i've been running since installing 9.10 (and i feel fewer issues/problems then 9.04)
2009-11-18T09:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Shwack	one of the few areas i can say that
2009-11-18T09:41:00.000Z	Shwack	ZykoticK9	-  9.10 brought a few audio hiccups my way but nothing a google search and a few terminal commands didn't fix.
