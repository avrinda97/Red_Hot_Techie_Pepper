2010-08-22T04:55:00.000Z	netsavy006		I have another question.
2010-08-22T04:56:00.000Z	netsavy006		I'd like to know there are apps in the application menu that are no longer installed yet listed there.  How do I get rid of them?
2010-08-22T04:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	System / Preferences / Main Menu
2010-08-22T23:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	have you enabled Partner repo and installed java?
2010-08-22T23:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	install sun-java-plugin (or similar name)
2010-08-22T23:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	from terminal try "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin"
2010-08-22T23:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	after adding partner you need to run "sudo apt-get update" first
2010-08-23T00:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	proprietary drivers don't work on LiveCD
2010-08-23T01:00:00.000Z	netsavy006	ZykoticK9	  no I have Ubuntu installed on my HD and I can't get into my computer.  But I want to install ATI driver on that, but I'm currently in LiveCD.  What can I do to get the Ati Drivers installed?
2010-08-23T01:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	see the !grub2 factoid for chrooting to your actual install then
2010-08-23T01:01:00.000Z	netsavy006	ZykoticK9	What did all that mean?
2010-08-23T01:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	if you chroot from the livecd to your physical HD then you can install software onto your HD install
2010-08-23T01:02:00.000Z	netsavy006	ZykoticK9	 How do I accomplish this?  Does it start by the terminal window?
2010-08-23T01:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	it's just the chroot instruction from that factoid link you want - stop after chroot directions
2010-08-23T01:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	you don't!  it's just that it includes instructions to chroot.  Never mind, best of luck.
2010-08-23T01:05:00.000Z	netsavy006	ZykoticK9	 Please don't just wish me luck.  I need a lot of help with this.
2010-08-23T01:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	i really can't help at all with ATI i'm affraid - was just trying to address how you can use the LiveCD to install stuff on your actuall installation.
2010-08-23T01:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	see Method3 of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20from%20LiveCD
2010-08-23T01:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	you could try adding text to the boot parameters to boot to text only mode
2010-08-23T01:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	if you are using Grub2 vga= no longer applies (nor does nosplash i believe)
2010-08-23T01:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	s/Grub2/new kernels
2010-08-23T01:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	netsavy006	ya vga= doesn't apply
2010-08-23T01:56:00.000Z	netsavy006	ZykoticK9	 So what do I do now?
