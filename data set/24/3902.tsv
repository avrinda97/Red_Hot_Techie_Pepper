2007-09-11T12:25:00.000Z	spiderwor1		can someone paste the contents of their /boot/grub/default file to a pastebin please?
2007-09-11T12:26:00.000Z	spiderwor1		also, beware cross-os crap
2007-09-11T12:27:00.000Z	spiderwor1		can someone PLEASE paste the contents of their /boot/grub/default file to a pastebin please?
2007-09-11T12:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	dpkg -S /boot/grub/default
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	unfortunately  dpkg -S /boot/grub/default won't work for me because i'm on the live cd
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	i just finished installing ubuntu , performed the updates, rebooted, and not even a grub menu
2007-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	i'm just trying to figure out if something in /boot/grub became corrupted
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	not even a grb error?
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	but if you have any other ideas i'd love to hear them
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	not even that... the system just hangs
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	how many drives?
2007-09-11T12:32:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	there are 2 hd drives and a dvd drive
2007-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	if you wind up with grub on both drives it can get confusing
2007-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	yeah the other drive only has some mythtv recordings on it...
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	check you don't have grub on the 2nd drive with sudo dd if=/dev/sd# bs=512 count=1 | od -c  - a grub binary will show in there "G   e   o   m  \0   H   a   r   d "
2007-09-11T12:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	that's how it looks - leave it alone
2007-09-11T12:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	you sure it's '^0' and not just plain '0' ??
2007-09-11T12:37:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	will go double check
2007-09-11T12:38:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	my bad, it's 0^@ and then around 10 line breaks...
2007-09-11T12:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	spiderwor1	that's most likely ok
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	runing dd if=/mnt/hdb1 bs=512 count=1 | od -c didnt tell me much
2007-09-11T12:46:00.000Z	spiderwor1	Frogzoo	it did say reading /mnt/hdb1': Is a directory ... this is an error maybe?
