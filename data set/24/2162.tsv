2009-04-22T05:17:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	yes thats right

2009-04-22T05:05:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	ok :)
2009-04-22T05:06:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	depending on your timezone, maybe one day :) 23.04 will the release
2009-04-22T05:07:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	ok, can't wait for it...i screwed up my ubuntu 8.10 install so i wan't 9.04 asap :D
2009-04-22T05:08:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	maybe use the rc1 and then upgrade in 1-2 days
2009-04-22T05:08:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	or use 8.04.2 LTS which i prefer
2009-04-22T05:08:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	i can wait a bit  more
2009-04-22T05:09:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	ok :)
2009-04-22T05:10:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	i installed kubuntu-desktop from the repos and it screwed my gnome :D
2009-04-22T05:10:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	hate is no good word
2009-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	the problem is that ubuntu is a verby bad distri for kde, if you want to enjoy kde use opensuse
2009-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	kde is so difficult, in gnome i could find everything with a few clicks
2009-04-22T05:12:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	its not difficult, its just different like linux and windows
2009-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	yeah i guess, but i miss gnome :D
2009-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	and why not using it?
2009-04-22T05:14:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	because i installed kunbuntu-desktop and it removed wicd from gnome, i cant use internet in gnome
2009-04-22T05:15:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	hm, sounds strange
2009-04-22T05:16:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	look at xfce4 it looks like gnoome but its smaller
2009-04-22T05:16:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	yes it does look like gnome but i like nautilus better
2009-04-22T05:17:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	as file manager i mean
2009-04-22T05:21:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	does wicd work in kde? if i install it in kde will i be able to use it in gnome again?
2009-04-22T05:21:00.000Z	iceroot	BePhantom	sorry dont know what wicd is
2009-04-22T05:21:00.000Z	BePhantom	iceroot	no problem :)
