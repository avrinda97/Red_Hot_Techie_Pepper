2008-04-12T04:20:00.000Z	matthew_		nope, php5.load and php5.conf still do not exist, even though libapache2-mod-php5 lists them as intalled files
2008-04-12T04:21:00.000Z	matthew_		could the package me messed up?
2008-04-12T04:22:00.000Z	matthew_		i'm trying to get php5 on my apache2 server, but I can't get the php5.load and php5.conf files
2008-04-12T04:22:00.000Z	matthew_		they are part of libapache2-mod-php5
2008-04-12T04:22:00.000Z	matthew_		and it says it has them installed
2008-04-12T04:22:00.000Z	matthew_		but they aren't there.
2008-04-12T04:22:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	I prefer LightTPD, it's easier to set up and much faster. YouTube is also using a modified version of it.
2008-04-12T04:23:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	You don't need to restart.
2008-04-12T04:23:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	You need to restart the apache server: /etc/init.d/apache restart I think.
2008-04-12T04:24:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	Yes it does.
2008-04-12T04:24:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	My LightTPD server is now running for about 3 months without any problems.
2008-04-12T04:25:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	You need to install the php5-cgi package.
2008-04-12T04:26:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	After having installed it, you need to go to the configuration file and enable the module.
2008-04-12T04:28:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	Ok, type in: sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi
2008-04-12T04:28:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	And then go to /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf
2008-04-12T04:30:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	In /etc/init.d there's a file called lighttpd.
2008-04-12T04:33:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	I forgot to say that you need to edit the file /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/10-fastcgi.conf in which /usr/bin/php5-cgi must be replaced by /usr/bin/php5-cgi.
2008-04-12T04:40:00.000Z	matthew_	tim1	I edited the /etc/lighttpd/conf-available file
2008-04-12T04:40:00.000Z	matthew_	tim1	Now what do I do?
2008-04-12T04:40:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	Ok, then restart or reload the server.
2008-04-12T04:41:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	The files are stored in /var/www/.
2008-04-12T04:41:00.000Z	matthew_	tim1	I have the apache2 server running, you have any idea how to stop it?
2008-04-12T04:42:00.000Z	matthew_	tim1	Sweet!!! Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you!
2008-04-12T04:48:00.000Z	tim1	matthew_	No problem.
