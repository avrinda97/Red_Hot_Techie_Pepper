2012-02-18T03:58:00.000Z	playit		anyone know how to change the default load location of an app?
2012-02-18T03:59:00.000Z	playit		(position and size)
2012-02-18T03:59:00.000Z	playit		firefox always loads all the way to the left ( which I don't like ) I want it to be centered
2012-02-18T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	compiz can specify workspaces where an app starts, you can also use devilspie (use gdevilspie to configure (available from google-code0)
2012-02-18T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	ps -ef | grep -i compiz     will show if you are ;)
2012-02-18T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	it will output a compiz process (you will always get a grep process)
2012-02-18T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	only one desktop is loaded at a time, all it uses is drive space
2012-02-18T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	here's mine http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/Blue%20Abstract.jpg
2012-02-20T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	sudo apt-get install samba
2012-02-20T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	you can then use nautilus to share folders
2012-02-20T02:16:00.000Z	playit	ActionParsnip	its already installed i think
2012-02-20T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	the OS will tell you if it is:)
2012-02-20T02:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	no, justsamba, not samba4
2012-02-20T02:19:00.000Z	playit	ActionParsnip	so its normal for it to say that when I type in 'samba' in terminal
2012-02-20T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	samba   itself isn't a program to run
2012-02-20T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	it installs a service which you then configure
2012-02-20T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	sweet :)
2012-02-20T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	it's /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-02-20T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	I can give my config file if you want. Shows how shares are defined
2012-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	http://paste.ubuntu.com/849270/
2012-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	last few lines are what you need
2012-02-20T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	sudo updatedb; locate filename
2012-02-20T03:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	samba uses the one in /etc/samba
2012-02-20T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	playit	run:  sudo smbpasswd -a $USER     then set a password for your username and you can authorise with that.
