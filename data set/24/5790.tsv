2006-04-29T05:46:00.000Z	Buntun00b		Is the default install broken with some packages?
2006-04-29T05:48:00.000Z	Buntun00b		When I try and install imagicmagick it says, dependences not met, yet this is a clean install.
2006-04-29T05:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	how are you installing imagemajick?
2006-04-29T05:49:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	apt-get install imagemagick
2006-04-29T05:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	you should enable the Universe & Multiverse repos, then try again
2006-04-29T05:50:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	I have.
2006-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	did you update after changing your sources?
2006-04-29T05:51:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	yes.
2006-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-get install imagemagick
2006-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	you had sudo in front of all of those?
2006-04-29T05:52:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	I've enable root on my machine,
2006-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	bleh - why? anyway, I just tried installing imagemagick, and it worked here
2006-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	copy this sources.list into yours, and try again: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047
2006-04-29T05:53:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	regardless of my reasons for having root enbable. That is not my problem. My problem is that this is suppose to be a stable ssytem yet it's complaining about dependences
2006-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	I suspect there's some error in your sources.list...
2006-04-29T05:54:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	I'll get back to you in 2 mins. :D thanks.
2006-04-29T05:59:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	how many years linux?
2006-04-29T05:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	a year :)
2006-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	Guess I should change my nick from n00b then...hehe....
2006-04-29T06:04:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	Thanks man it's worked.  I'm still confused as to why my previous sources list did not work, it was the gb.ubutu ones, they are suppose to be mirrors correct just more localized.
2006-04-29T06:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	some of the mirrors have issues - I always use the main archives
2006-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	I'm going to as well now.
2006-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	Buntun00b	Madpilot	who do we report broken mirrors to? Because I'd much rather have downloads at 400k than 40k.
2006-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Buntun00b	I'm not sure
