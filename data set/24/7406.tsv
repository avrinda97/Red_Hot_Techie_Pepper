2005-05-29T10:43:00.000Z	carthik		Hi, can someone please help me figure out my cups woes?
2005-05-29T10:43:00.000Z	carthik		The Cups' cup of woes runneth over!
2005-05-29T10:43:00.000Z	delire	carthik	hehe what's up?
2005-05-29T10:45:00.000Z	carthik	delire	when I restart cupsd, I get a "child exited with status 98!" error. when I try netstat -nlt, I find that no ones listening to poor port 631. nc -l -p 631 says " Can't grab 0.0.0.0:631 with bind: Permission denied".
2005-05-29T10:45:00.000Z	carthik	delire	I need to get others printing via the network to this printer connected to a ubuntu desktop
2005-05-29T10:45:00.000Z	delire	carthik	have you gone through the whole printer registration process at http://localhost:631 ?
2005-05-29T10:46:00.000Z	carthik	delire	ubuntu does not allow me to configure cups via the browser. asks me to go cry on the System->Administration->Printers screen
2005-05-29T10:46:00.000Z	carthik	delire	I edited cupsd.conf and that is why I wanted to restart cups
2005-05-29T10:47:00.000Z	delire	carthik	ahah, i see.
2005-05-29T10:47:00.000Z	carthik	delire	if could see that port 631 is being listened-to, I would be happier
2005-05-29T10:49:00.000Z	delire	carthik	'netstat -tupa' ?
2005-05-29T10:50:00.000Z	carthik	delire	there is a "tcp 1 0 localhost.localdo:32853 localhost.localdoma:ipp CLOSE_WAIT 11587/gnome-cups-ma" line in there
2005-05-29T10:51:00.000Z	delire	carthik	you have 'sudo gnome-cups-manager'?
2005-05-29T10:52:00.000Z	carthik	delire	sorry, what does that mean? I never played with the default gnome-cups-manager
2005-05-29T10:54:00.000Z	delire	carthik	nor have i, i just see that that's your cups manager
2005-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	carthik	delire	so dead-end it is :)
2005-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	carthik	delire	I teach at a univ too :)
2005-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	delire	carthik	ahah, what's your experience. kids prefer Gnome or KDE?
2005-05-29T10:56:00.000Z	carthik	delire	KDE, by far. But soon some of them take to gnome, after a few weeks of trying both.
2005-05-29T10:57:00.000Z	delire	carthik	this has also happened here, but those people seem to be more 'geek' than the others.
2005-05-29T10:57:00.000Z	carthik	delire	they have an "Enlightened" aura - yes :)
2005-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	delire	carthik	have to say administering KDE machines is far easier than in Gnome; though i have more experience with Gnome, i've found tools like Kuser, smb4k and the Control Center altogether are quite incredible to work with.
2005-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	carthik	delire	yes, lots of ways to control stuff. True. I was a KDE user. Even now, I use KDE applications. Like Kile, and KSnapshot
2005-05-29T11:03:00.000Z	delire	carthik	i have an assistant that helps out with administering machines. i can show her how to setup group policies, configure samba, setup print services and configure X all from a UI.
