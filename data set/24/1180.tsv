2010-05-31T22:23:00.000Z	hemza		ok ... but i need a software like CCLEANER in windows
2010-05-31T22:23:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	what do you want to achieve ?
2010-08-07T21:56:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	secure ? you're deleting files, that's very secure
2010-08-07T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	rm
2010-08-07T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	also applications (firefox for example) have tools built in, eg: delete history files, etc
2010-08-07T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	no you don't find that
2010-08-07T22:12:00.000Z	hemza	ikonia	i do ... try go to applications>accessries>passwords and Encryption keys  ... there u can find all ur passwords
2010-08-07T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	that's an application for reading YOUR passwords, show me where that's stored insecure
2010-08-07T22:13:00.000Z	hemza	ikonia	if this can read my password so it is easy to find it ... ?????????
2010-08-07T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	no it's not !
2010-08-07T22:13:00.000Z	hemza	ikonia	usually passwords must be unreadable
2010-08-07T22:14:00.000Z	hemza	ikonia	how?
2010-08-07T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	they ARE unreadable, they are set in encyption, but as they are YOUR passwords, ubuntu knows YOUR key when you login
2010-08-07T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	no-one else on that machine can read them
2010-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	you shouln't know the root password
2010-08-07T22:16:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	there is an unknown root password on ubuntu
2010-08-07T22:19:00.000Z	hemza	ikonia	how i shouldn't know root password ... it is my machine
2010-08-07T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	because ubuntu does not tell you the root password, it uses the sudo model
2010-08-07T22:20:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	then you use sudo
2010-08-07T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	hemza	check out the private messages ubottu just sent you
