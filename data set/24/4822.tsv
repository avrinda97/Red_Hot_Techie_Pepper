2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	Peebo		When I type mount I get this : /dev/hdb1 on /media/hdb1 type ntfs (rw)     but if I try to do something I'm told it's a read only file system. HELP !
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	You need to install ntfs-3g to have writea-access to NTFS
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	 Just did that do I have to reboot for it to take hold
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	no
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Is there a new mount command for ntfs-3g
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	use ntfs-3g /dev/hdb1 /mnt/windows
2007-01-07T12:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	try reading the man pages: man ntfs-3g
2007-01-07T12:13:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Looks like in need to run ntfsfix
2007-01-07T12:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	I've not had much sucesss from ntfsfix - had to use a Windows boot to chkdsk it
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Yeah no luck here either, Oh well I have a windoze live CD here. I'll reboot into that and be back...
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Thanx any how mate
2007-01-09T07:41:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	What was your longest wireless shot? Mine was 5 Km's not far I know but terrain got it the way
2007-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	hlaf-duplex could get 54Mbps out to 2km using circular polarised directional attenas
2007-01-09T07:45:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	I used a horizontally polarised half pipe shaped directional antenna
2007-01-09T07:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	I've got the farm here covered with an omnidirectional driven by a custom-firmware Linksys WAP54G with its power upped by about 25%
2007-01-09T07:46:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	upped by 25% means your probably close to a netgear with no weaking.
2007-01-09T07:47:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	all devices  are set close to the legal maximum in the amps, taking account of the EIRP which depends on the antennas
2007-01-09T07:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	- I've never had a problem with WAP54Gs, and we've installed hundreds
2007-01-09T07:49:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	What country U in ?
2007-01-09T07:50:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Ok I'm in Aus so the spec's should be the same. How did you boost the TX power
2007-01-09T07:52:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	That would make radio a little difficult :).  Didn't they notice they couldn't get the local FM station
2007-01-09T07:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	HyperWAP v1.0 v2.07
2007-01-09T07:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Peebo	- they didn't have radio receivers, just a temp office until their new premises were built
2007-01-09T07:54:00.000Z	Peebo	IntuitiveNipple	Just googled that so I'm off to investigate
