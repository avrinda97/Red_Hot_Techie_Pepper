2006-09-24T10:09:00.000Z	bruenig		Schlaken, that appears to indicate something, not sure what but certainly something
2006-09-24T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig		maybe there is some problem with something in the directory
2006-09-24T10:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	no, he has full permissions already.
2006-09-24T11:37:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	I think cpw is drunk.
2006-09-28T09:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	no, because there are already hardware companies.
2006-09-28T09:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	that's the ubuntu-helping spirit! =D
2006-09-28T09:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	what? This? A liberal democracy? Have you seen the government lately?!
2006-09-28T09:20:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	right, that fits within my vague satire
2006-09-28T09:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	it's definitely checkable. md5sum /dev/hdc
2006-09-28T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	I had assumed he was using windows, just a hunch
2006-09-28T09:27:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	yes, same as dapper is.
2006-10-04T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	his claim is wrong, but apt-get is not the same as aptitude
2006-10-04T09:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	no, apt-get is not the same as aptitude, but it works just as well. It's just not GUI. Different strokes...
2006-10-04T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	apt-get is not gui, apt-get doesn't track dependencies, aptitude does
2006-10-04T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	as in when you do aptitude remove, it removes all the dependencies it installed with it so that they don't float around on your disk uselessly
2006-10-04T09:14:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	ah, yes, that's correct. However, what kitche was saying is that if you try to install a new program with apt-get, it won't fetch all the dependencies it needs and the program won't be runnable, which is BS and FUD.
2006-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	yeah, that is why I said, he was wrong but that to say they are the same is wrong, even if they are essentially the same for his purpose
2006-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	I never said they were the same! I said, and I quote: kitche: that's FUD. apt-get works just as well as aptitude.
2006-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	I assure you I'm perfectly aware they're different programs.
2006-10-04T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	I figured you did know they were different, just that you may be dumbing stuff down for a noob, which is never good
2006-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	no, no, I never attempted to convey the impression that they were THE SAME, merely that if you apt-get install foobar, you will get foobar; and that if you aptitude install foobar, you will get foobar.
2006-10-13T09:18:00.000Z	bruenig	ArrenLex	but the beta...
2006-10-13T09:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	the blog I linked to says the beta will be out "soon".
2006-12-03T06:02:00.000Z	ArrenLex	bruenig	q
