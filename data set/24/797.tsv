2011-03-27T03:31:00.000Z	Darkenvy		hey whats a program that will regulate my sound to one sound level?
2011-03-27T03:33:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I want my sound level to be even all the way through. im tired of quiet movies making me blast my speakers next time I play an MP3
2011-03-27T03:33:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	Then you'll have to get every recording company in the world to record and burn things are the same volume
2011-03-27T03:34:00.000Z	Darkenvy	edbian	obviously you dont know such software DOES exist
2011-03-27T03:34:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	Oh you mean that feature in itunes that automatically adjusts the volume?
2011-03-27T03:35:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	It's in some audio players.  Amarok I believe has it.
2011-03-27T03:35:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	I don't know.
2011-05-12T03:41:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	what is the output of uname -a  ?
2011-05-12T03:43:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	I'm not sure if there is a way to upgrade to 64 bit.
2011-05-12T03:43:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	What is the output of free -m  ?
2011-05-12T03:44:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	It's not that switching from 32 to 64 is dangerous.  It's impossible
2011-05-12T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	And all the 32 bit libraries
2011-05-12T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	And all the apps that depend on those libraries
2011-05-12T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	haha
2011-05-12T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	yeah probably
2011-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	no offense but I do not think it is difficult or confusing to download 64bit Ubuntu
2011-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	Darkenvy	edbian	you are missing the point
2011-05-12T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	Do you have a separate /home partition?
2011-05-12T03:48:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	Yes.  It would mean you could fresh install without erasing home
2011-05-12T03:48:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	You could create a partition, copy your home onto it and then reinstall and tell thei nstaller to use that partition
2011-05-12T03:48:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	The system is designed to have /home on another partition. It will hurt absolutely nothing
2011-05-12T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	There are tutorials on how to move from a single partition system to a 2 partition system ( / and /home ).  You could follow one and then when you install 64 bit simply point it at /home .
2011-05-12T03:50:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	It is not pointless.  It's helpful for your reinstall
2011-05-12T03:51:00.000Z	edbian	Darkenvy	It's about the journey not the destination. :P
