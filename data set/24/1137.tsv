2010-06-24T01:02:00.000Z	jeremywi		I'm running Lucid, and I can't get my microphone to be detected.  Halp?
2010-06-24T01:03:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	microphones and webcams are kind of an issue with Linux, is it a machine microphone?
2010-06-24T01:03:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	you can lspci to see if it shows up and then try to find a driver for it.
2010-06-24T01:05:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	Is this it? "Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)"
2010-06-24T01:05:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	No, that looks like one of your sound controllers.
2010-06-24T01:06:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	Well, if that's not it, I don't think I see anything.
2010-06-24T01:08:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	One moment,
2010-06-24T01:09:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/ - post the output of your lspci there.

2010-06-24T01:12:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	I do not see it either. = / Unfortunately I have the same issue.
2010-06-24T01:12:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	Then what is to be done?
2010-06-24T01:13:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	Go buy a nice usb driven microphone or microphone/headset setup and enjoy it? I've never really succeeded in getting my microphone working.
2010-06-24T01:13:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	In general, yes sir. I would not buy anything from Microsoft, like their wireless headset. I would get a logitech product. Ideally it should work out-of-the-box.
2010-06-24T01:14:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	And should it detect a microphone that I plug into the microphone jack on the computer?
2010-06-24T01:14:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	Again that's up in the air. It depends on whether or not your Linux will detect your phone jack. Does it detect your headset jack when you plugin headsets?
2010-06-24T01:18:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	And my sound pretty much just stopped working.
2010-06-24T01:19:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	On your speakers?
2010-06-24T01:20:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	Wait, now it is.
2010-06-24T01:22:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	So is it not going to be able to detect microphones that I plug into the microphone jack?
2010-06-24T01:23:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	It should, but I'd play it safe and get a USB microphone. That will almost certainly work.
2010-06-24T01:24:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	You can try it. Plug them in - if they're not detected, reboot while they're plugged in.
2010-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	We've got it working.  We just need a cable to merge the headphone and microphone cable into one.
2010-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	jeremywi	ljruff	Thanks for your help.
2010-06-24T01:27:00.000Z	ljruff	jeremywi	Always a pleasure.
