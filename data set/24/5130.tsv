2006-12-19T11:12:00.000Z	lmosher		Is there a wireless network program that I can get that will detect and connect to a set of ESSID's? I.E. so that if I go to work and home it will automatically connect to whichever network it finds?? It's annoying to switch and in Windows it works just fine.
2006-12-19T11:12:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	i believe network-manager-gnome will do that
2006-12-19T11:13:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	it runs it your notification area so once you install it it will start up with gnome, but for now just run network-manager-gnome &
2006-12-19T11:13:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	thanks very much! What's the one currently running? it has an icon of two monitors and then a green bar for signal strength (it's the default Edgy wireless manager)
2006-12-19T11:14:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	i dunno but it sux lol
2006-12-19T11:14:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	yeah. I guess my question is, do I need to remove this existing applet or should I just remove it from the panel?
2006-12-19T11:15:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	no you don't have to remove it, just remove it from the panel cuz it's annoying lol
2006-12-19T11:15:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	yes, yes it is. Thanks :)
2006-12-19T11:21:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	I installed network-manager and network-manager-gnome, but "network-manager-gnome" isn't a command. (using tab completion only network-admin shows up)
2006-12-19T11:22:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	network-manager-gnome is only the package name. run nm-applet with an & sign after it to run it in the background
2006-12-19T11:22:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	so it wolud be "nm-applet &"
2006-12-19T11:22:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	ah thanks :)
2006-12-19T11:22:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	it starts up with gnome btw
2006-12-19T11:22:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	there we go. cool thanks.
2006-12-19T11:23:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	cool glad i could help
2006-12-19T11:25:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	oops sorry I still need something. Its running but it just says "no network connection" ...
2006-12-19T11:25:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	click on the little icon - it should bring up a list of wired and wireless networks
2006-12-19T11:25:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	hm, nope :(
2006-12-19T11:26:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	are you trying a wireless connection? run sudo ifconfig eth1 up
2006-12-19T11:26:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	if that doesn't work just restart your computer lol
2006-12-19T11:27:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	hehe well my wireless network is already up :)
2006-12-19T11:27:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	then what's the problem?
2006-12-19T11:28:00.000Z	lmosher	strabes	the problem is nm-applet isn't recognizing that i have wireless networking. It's just showing a greyed out "wired network".. I don't need to ifup eth1 because I'm on eth1 right now.
2006-12-19T11:29:00.000Z	strabes	lmosher	i dunno; try restarting
