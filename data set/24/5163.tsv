2006-11-06T17:41:00.000Z	Waerner		Hey, can I run two commands in bash (in a script file) and make them appear on the same line?
2006-11-06T17:42:00.000Z	Waerner		Like, add a timestamp ( date +%H:%M:%S ) in the front of all "echoes"
2006-11-06T17:43:00.000Z	Waerner		Anyone who's familiar enough with bash to answer to my question? :)
2006-11-06T17:45:00.000Z	Waerner		Am I being ignored? :P
2006-11-06T17:46:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	don't ask to ask, just ask
2006-11-06T17:46:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Already done that, twice...
2006-11-06T17:46:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	you mean the output on the same line?
2006-11-06T17:47:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Exactly
2006-11-06T17:47:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	too easy: printf "%s %s\n" $(cmd1) $(cmd2)
2006-11-06T17:48:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Oh, thanks :)  Is it that easy= :P
2006-11-06T17:48:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	$() is a nicer bash form of ``
2006-11-06T17:57:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Can you please give me the raw containg these  $() again? It seems like Irssi lost it in this giant chat =)
2006-11-06T17:58:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	 raw = line :)
2006-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Xchat requires X ;)
2006-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Thanks :)
2006-11-06T06:01:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Sorry for a stupid question, but what does these things do? "%s %s\n"
2006-11-06T06:02:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	man printf
2006-11-06T06:02:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	 man printf?
2006-11-06T06:02:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	You don't need to explain if you don't want to, It works, that's the most important =)
2006-11-06T06:02:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	e.g. tyoe that in your console and READ
2006-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	it just that I'm tring to go to sleep IRC is too addictive...
2006-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	I tried it, and the cmd1 and cmd2 worked, but I just wondered about those percent-chars...
2006-11-06T06:04:00.000Z	ifireball	Waerner	the "printf" command does the magic here, read its manpage for details.
2006-11-06T06:04:00.000Z	Waerner	ifireball	Will do. Once again, thanks alot :)
