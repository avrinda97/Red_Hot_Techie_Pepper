2009-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		How can I make a link so running 'program -option' actually runs 'program_by_another_name -option'?
2009-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	an alias?
2009-07-01T04:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	sure
2009-07-01T04:08:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	alias foo='bar'
2009-07-01T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	yep
2009-07-02T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	ext3?
2010-02-09T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	why?
2010-02-09T05:35:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	because currently, members of this role account are creating files in the account's $HOME which are owned by the user and have a group the role account isn't in. Thus, they are unwritable.
2010-02-09T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	"the account" being the "role account"?
2010-02-09T05:36:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	yes
2010-02-09T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	what you said doesn't make sense to me then
2010-02-09T05:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	Do you understand what I mean by "role account"?
2010-02-09T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	please explain
2010-02-09T05:38:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	an account multiple users can su/sudo into. There is a group by the same name which those members are in - so they can access the role account's files.
2010-02-09T05:39:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	however, if they *create* files in the role account's $HOME, they would be owned by their normal account, and in their normal account's primary group. Which the role account is /not/ in. Thus, those files are unmodifiable by the role account.
2010-02-09T05:40:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	the users cannot chown or chgrp the files, so some mechanism to force file ownership and/or group inside the role account's $HOME seems like a very sensible way to solve the issue.
2010-02-09T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	the answer to your original question is ACLs, but there is bound to be a better solution here.  If people are su or sudo into the role account, why are the files not being created as the role user?
2010-02-09T05:41:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	because they're human and thus lazy - doing it this way saves them trouble initially (until we get stuck with unmodifiable files)
2010-02-09T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	so they are creating files with their own accounts and presumably have access because they belong to the role group?
2010-02-09T05:41:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	yes
2010-02-09T05:43:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	usually you can do this two ways: 1) ACLs (man setfacl, man getfacl, man mount (you have to add the acl option)) and 2) is to change the umask so files created are group-writable for those users and setgid the directory in question (this way files should be owned by the group on the parent directory by default)
2010-02-09T05:44:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	I think setgit is what I was thinking of... is there setuid too?
2010-02-09T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	Mike_lifeguard	there is but I actually don't think it has any effect on directories
2010-02-09T05:44:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	jrib	ok, well I will look into those - thanks
