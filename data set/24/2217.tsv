2009-03-04T03:48:00.000Z	aplus		no i did not
2009-03-04T03:48:00.000Z	aplus		this just happened a few minutes ago
2009-03-04T03:49:00.000Z	aplus		Do you think the RAM is the reason it will not start up? Or were you thinking that maybe i installed new RAM recently and that was the problem?
2009-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	aplus		well this laptop has not been modified for a year since i wiped xp and installed vista
2009-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	aplus		So outside of the power cord and the battery what could be the problem
2009-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	aplus		negative
2009-03-04T03:52:00.000Z	aplus		We cannot even get to a screen to use a bootup disk
2009-03-04T03:52:00.000Z	aplus		Then shuts off
2009-03-04T03:53:00.000Z	aplus		Could it be the main board, hoonteke?
2009-03-04T03:53:00.000Z	aplus		The computer  does stay on 24/7
2009-03-04T03:53:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	yeah, I don't know.  Laptops are harder to diagnose.  My first guess is yes, it's a mobo issue
2009-03-04T03:48:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	did you just install new ram?
2009-03-04T03:49:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	I don't know.  I just had it happen to my girlfriends computer when we upgraded her to 4gigs
2009-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	does it beep before turning off?
2009-03-04T03:51:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	alright, I don't know then without being there first hand.  Have you tried booting off of a CD?
2009-03-04T03:51:00.000Z	aplus	hoonteke	when we shut the laptop off it was because it froze, then there was a blinking cursor at the upper left corner of the screen
2009-03-04T03:52:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	hmm, without doing more diagnostics, it sounds like a hardware error then.  Can you even get to the bios screen?
2009-03-04T03:52:00.000Z	aplus	hoonteke	the laptop doesn't even light up the screen whatsoever, only the capslock, power, and number lock icons. And only briefly
2009-03-04T03:54:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	for future reference, if it's a non-booting mobo, often mobo's will beep at you.  It's annoying, but if you have the specs for the mobo, or can look them up, it will tell you what the issue is.
2009-03-04T03:57:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	no, 4 gigs is enough, I assume you've got a decent cpu, gfx card, and hdd too?
2009-03-04T03:57:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	then it sounds like either a software issue, or a driver issue.
2009-03-04T04:00:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	dunno
2009-03-04T04:01:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	the lots of extra fan noise roughly means "lots of extra heat" roughly means lots of extra computation.
2009-03-04T04:01:00.000Z	hoonteke	aplus	there's no telling if the computation is just a lot of todo, a pisspoor algorithm internal to the game, or a bug in the driver.
