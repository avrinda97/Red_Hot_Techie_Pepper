2008-06-21T09:14:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		How do I permanently load a kernel module?
2008-06-21T09:15:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		After 6 hours of trying to do a clean Ubuntu install, it seems my HD won't work without a kernel module being loaded...
2008-06-21T09:15:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		and now that it's installed, it won't start unless I do modprobe ide_generic in the initrdfs terminal
2008-06-21T09:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	cant you add that to /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-21T09:16:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	I don't know.  That's what I'm asking
2008-06-21T09:16:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		Can I?  If so, how?
2008-06-21T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst  add it to the command line before quiet and splash....
2008-06-21T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	to get into your install now.. hit escape on boot to get grub menu then e then e then make the edit.. which will only work for this session then gksodu like I showed you
2008-06-21T09:20:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	I've already installed the system.  Modproble is a kernel option?
2008-06-21T09:20:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	I didn't realize it could be passed along with those options?  I thought it was a command
2008-06-21T09:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	I am just suggesting a different way to handle this
2008-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	  To get live cd to run this often helps..At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
2008-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	You misunderstand me
2008-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	but in your case.. noapic acpi=off, pci=irqroute, xmodule=vesa, vga=normal, vga=771, vga=791, pci=irqroute, framebuffer=false, ide=nodma, nomce, pnpbios=off, xdrvr=vesa, res=800x600, apm=off,pci=noapci, nolapic, all_generic_ide, nolapic, pci=assign-busses, pci=irqpoll, pci=biosirq, pnpbios=off, hpet=disable, xmodule=vesa, vga=normal, vga=771, pci=irqroute, framebuffer=false
2008-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		I have already installed Ubuntu.
2008-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	In order to get the LiveCD running, I had to pass the "break=top" boot option so I could do "mod_probe ide_generic".  The kernel doesn't seem to like my hard drive otherwise.  However, now that I have it installed, it didn't boot at first.  Instead it fell back to the initrdfs console and I had to type modprobe again in order to boot
2008-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	I understand you have installed ubuntu..  I am sipl suggesting you can add  all_generic_ide to the command line at boot or one of the other many options that some people need
2008-06-21T09:24:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		I see
2008-06-21T09:24:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	It would've been simpler if you didn't list every command line option imaginable :-P
2008-06-21T09:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	  To get live cd to run this often helps..At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add  all_generic_ide before the "--"   and see if it boots and sees your hard drive
2008-06-21T09:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	You didnt seem to be getting the drift of what I was telling you
2008-06-21T09:26:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	I just don't see how the LiveCD is relevant anymore.  Are you saying I should add ï»¿all_generic_ide to menu.lst?
2008-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	BlueLaguna	I know you got it installed... I am saying you can test what I am telling you by running the livecd again and editing the command line...  or you can boot your existing install and do a one time edit of your grub command line or you can edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	BlueLaguna	Jack_Sparrow	Alright.  Thanks, I'll try adding it to menu.lst
