2008-02-05T11:57:00.000Z	enduser		Is there a form of ubuntu I can put on my old Mac G3?
2008-02-05T11:57:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	I would think that it should work
2008-02-05T12:01:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	gilda nickrud thanks I will go check out that link and then I am sure I will have a few more questions.
2008-02-05T12:21:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	gilda nickrud: I am downloading an iso disk for xubuntu 7.10 to try on the Mac G3 with 64mb ram. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I will keep you posted.
2008-02-05T12:21:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	that amount of ram might be a problem
2008-02-05T12:21:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	you will probably need the "alternate" install, the livecd probably needs a lot more RAM than that
2008-02-05T12:23:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	I am downloading the alternate CD maybe it is not an ISO sorry I am new at this so I don't know what all the terms mean.
2008-02-05T12:23:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	the alternate cd is what you want
2008-02-05T12:24:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	you should be on the right track, good luck
2008-02-05T12:24:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	you should probably think about getting more ram though
2008-02-05T12:25:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	that is what is almost downloaded may done in 5 more munites. Where would I buy more ram for this old thing?
2008-02-05T12:25:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	what kind of g3? It probably uses pc100 or pc133
2008-02-05T12:26:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda: here are the specs http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g3/stats/powerbook_g3_333.html
2008-02-05T12:30:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	gilda: I don't know the ram might have been updated. I guess I have to get it running before I can check.
2008-02-05T12:31:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	gilda: unless you guys know a way to check without an os on the machine.
2008-02-05T12:31:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	not sure about macs
2008-02-05T12:35:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	gilda the cd is downloaded I am going to burn it and then give it a try. I will keep you posted in a few minutes.
2008-02-05T12:51:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda:  The Mac found the Install CD and I am starting the install!!! I will keep you posted Thank so much for your help!!
2008-02-05T12:56:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda:  It is having some trouble finding CD-Rom Drivers. I don't have any, so I am going to try to continue by picking manually select CD-ROM modules. Cross your fingers.
2008-02-05T13:05:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda: I need to find drivers for the CD-ROM Drive. At this point I could skip this step and try to find them later, unless you guys have any leads?
2008-02-05T13:15:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda: Well it looks like the CD Rom driver thing was a bigger issue than I first thought. I am going to try installing from a USB and maybe hunt around for drivers tomorrow.
2008-02-05T13:17:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	and gilda: It is getting late here so I might do the USB thing tomorrow too. Thanks again for your help.
2008-02-05T13:17:00.000Z	twentyafterfour	enduser	good luck
2008-02-05T13:18:00.000Z	enduser	twentyafterfour	Thanks, I hope I see you here again some time.
