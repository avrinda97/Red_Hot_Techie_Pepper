2005-02-17T15:55:00.000Z	pharynx		ok let's try again, anybody seen gnome-panel freezes when accessing certain menu items?
2005-02-17T15:56:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Yeah, 3 time @ 2 -3 mins yesterday.
2005-02-17T15:58:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	But also whilest closing certain things.
2005-02-17T15:59:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	MS word did it first, thought "ah typical"
2005-02-17T15:59:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	MS Word??
2005-02-17T16:00:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	yeah, crossover. need it for word docs that I recieve.
2005-02-17T16:02:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Then froze once when closing network window and once after trying to change certain preferances.
2005-02-17T16:02:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	OpenOffice doesn't work for your purpose?
2005-02-17T16:02:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Sometimes it changes the formating of complicated docs
2005-02-17T16:03:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Otherwise yes, and I use it as well.
2005-02-17T16:03:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	hmmm ok
2005-02-17T16:04:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	the bad thing about it is that bug-buddy tries to send the stack trace to someone, but it freezes also
2005-02-17T16:06:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	I think though with me its just Nautilus thats having problems, mouse still moves, just can't do anything.
2005-02-17T16:07:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	.. thing is, i wasn't running nautilus or is nautilus *always* runs a'la explorer.exe?
2005-02-17T16:08:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Nautilus is like konqueror on kde.
2005-02-17T16:10:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	same here.. I like it so far, except for this darn hanging
2005-02-17T16:10:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	where did you see the message?
2005-02-17T16:11:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	no i mean where.. like in /var/log or something?
2005-02-17T16:11:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	No, came as window on desktop
2005-02-17T16:12:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	i see, i got similar message except it's gnome-panel that has to close
2005-02-17T16:13:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	unfort.ly mine never came back :(
2005-02-17T16:13:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Hasn't hung today yet.
2005-02-17T16:14:00.000Z	KevMan	pharynx	Otherwise like Ubuntu so far.
2005-02-17T16:17:00.000Z	pharynx	KevMan	ok, i'll try asking again later... thx for responding! gotta go!
