2009-02-26T00:57:00.000Z	tehboriz		what's the best irc program for unbuntu? I'm looking for SSL and simplicity
2009-02-26T00:57:00.000Z	tehboriz		is xchat really availible for it?
2009-02-26T00:57:00.000Z	tehboriz		i'm using xchat on my windows right now
2009-02-26T00:58:00.000Z	tehboriz		thanks Blaize
2009-02-26T00:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	or if you can't figure that out, install xchat-gnome (not quite as robust as xchat, but it'll get you on IRC)
2009-02-26T00:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	you gotta crawl before you run a marathon
2009-04-28T04:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	that doesn't sound good.. thats one reason i hate using the net to upgrade
2009-04-28T04:55:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	what do you reccomend? I wanna finish the upgrade or at least fix my XORG... i get get into command line easily
2009-04-28T04:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	you can try reconfiguring..
2009-04-28T04:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	you can try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    just take generic defaults, see if that gets you back to a working desktop, but i wouldn't get my hopes up
2009-04-28T04:57:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	thanks, i'll try it now
2009-04-28T05:39:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	i got it back to the boxes...
2009-04-28T05:23:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	didn't work :( gave a bunch of questions
2009-04-28T05:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	those questions is how it reconfigures your xorg.conf
2009-04-28T05:35:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	now it broke even more "ubuntu is running in low graphics mode"
2009-04-28T05:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	but can you get to a GUI?
2009-04-28T05:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	i thought you said it was doing that before.
2009-04-28T05:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	did you just take generic defaults, thats what i would do.
2009-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	i did that.
2009-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	dunno.. but i don't see how it would have "borked it more"
2009-04-28T05:38:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	am i doomed to format?
2009-04-28T05:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	dunno.. sounds like somethign definitely went nanners when you lost your connection during the upgrade.. it would probably easiest to clean install
2009-04-28T05:38:00.000Z	tehboriz	IndyGunFreak	should i use kernel framebuffer device interface?
2009-04-28T05:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tehboriz	whats default
