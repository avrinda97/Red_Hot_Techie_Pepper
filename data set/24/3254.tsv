2008-03-21T00:28:00.000Z	corinne_		Hey, everyone.  I was wondering, is there a way to play .rm files in ubuntu?  vlc and mplayer aren't agreeing.
2008-03-21T00:28:00.000Z	corinne_		Oh man.  I guess I have to.  *sigh*
2008-03-21T00:29:00.000Z	corinne_		helixplayer works?
2008-03-21T00:30:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	i tried to use helixplayer, no luck
2008-03-21T00:30:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	standard players dont offer to install the plugins for you?
2008-03-21T00:31:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	hmm, would you have an url for testing?
2008-03-21T00:32:00.000Z	corinne_	gregory	I'm not sujre what you mean.
2008-03-21T00:33:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	ok, my mistake. one step back. what is the message when it "doesnt find the plugins"?
2008-03-21T00:33:00.000Z	corinne_	gregory	"There is no matching application available."
2008-03-21T00:35:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	you were using synaptic. could be a problem with the repositories (database where all the software is stored)
2008-03-21T00:36:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-03-21T00:41:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-03-21T00:41:00.000Z	corinne_	gregory	7.10
2008-03-21T00:42:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	could you also give me the internet address of the rm you are trying to play?
2008-03-21T00:43:00.000Z	corinne_	gregory	http://www.mininova.org/get/1256224
2008-03-21T00:44:00.000Z	gregory	corinne_	hold on for a few minutes. i am just installing 7.10 into a virtual machine
