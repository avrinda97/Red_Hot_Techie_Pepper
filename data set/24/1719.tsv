2009-09-20T23:59:00.000Z	sanyi78		Hi All!
2009-09-20T23:59:00.000Z	sanyi78		Anybody user Ati HD4890 videocard on Ubuntu?
2009-09-20T23:59:00.000Z	sanyi78		Sorry, user=use...
2009-09-21T00:00:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	HD4850 here
2009-09-21T00:00:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	likely you dont have the drivers installed (windows does this too without drivers)
2009-09-21T00:01:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers            (if you really cant increase it in the setting omen just wrote)
2009-09-21T00:01:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	it should offer you drivers automatically
2009-09-21T00:02:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	it never offered anything there? not after first boot?
2009-09-21T00:03:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	well i would recommend finding a step by step guide to install the drivers. it's not a 1 command thingy.
2009-09-21T00:04:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	though i find it weird the drivers are not automatically offered to you :-(
2009-09-21T00:05:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	 can you send me an URL about ati hdXXXX install?
2009-09-21T00:05:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	yes you can do that. but you also have to have the drivers. again i'd suggest a step by step guide somewhere on the internet
2009-09-21T00:05:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	ill try and find a good one
2009-09-21T00:05:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	which ubuntu are you running? 32/64 bit ?
2009-09-21T00:05:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	THANKS! :)
2009-09-21T00:06:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	kubuntu 9.04
2009-09-21T00:06:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	I thied in normal ubuntu under gnome, but it was same....
2009-09-21T00:07:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	both kde and gnome use xorg. and xorg is the issue as you correctly understood :)
2009-09-21T00:07:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	ok, i'm learning! :) -thanks
2009-09-21T00:08:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	indeed ati 4890 drivers are not shipped with ubuntu 9.04 :-(((((((((((((
2009-09-21T00:08:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	i found a guide here: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Jaunty_Installation_Guide#The_Ubuntu_way_to_install_the_Proprietary_Drivers
2009-09-21T00:09:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	it's pretty down to manually editing configuration files. unfortunately.
2009-09-21T00:10:00.000Z	sanyi78	smerz	thanks a lot of, i read it
2009-09-21T00:10:00.000Z	smerz	sanyi78	good luck! hd4850 is supported out of the box ;(. good luck to you :)
