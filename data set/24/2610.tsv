2011-01-14T06:26:00.000Z	dsdeiz		where's ubuntu's hardware information?
2011-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	you can use varius comandline tools to get useful information but if your looking for an equivilent of windows file manager...
2011-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	tim_		*device manager
2011-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	dsdeiz		yeah, i did lspci | grep -i vga and it says "Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller"
2011-01-14T06:28:00.000Z	dsdeiz		i'm not sure what driver to install since when i go to "Monitors" it can't detect my monitor
2011-01-14T06:28:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	xorg shouldn't need a config these days
2011-01-14T06:29:00.000Z	dsdeiz	tim_	hm, so no drivers to install?
2011-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	that's not entirely true
2011-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	if you look at the packages avialable for xorg there are drivers specific to ati or nvidia
2011-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	tim_		maybe intel also
2011-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	tim_		but a lot of stuff is already in the kernel or installed with xorg by default
2011-01-14T06:30:00.000Z	dsdeiz	tim_	do i just try them one by one?
2011-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	its a long time since I've fiddled with this, give me a mo to look
2011-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	dsdeiz		i can't get into the generic config in grub, i need to choose the 2nd option and choose low graphics for ubuntu to start
2011-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	dsdeiz	tim_	oh, sure thang
2011-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	tim_		ok, so if you look in your package manager you probably already have
2011-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	tim_		xserver-xorg-video-intel installed
2011-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	tim_		and if you look in your xorg log which is in /var/log, you can see it being used (hopefuly)
2011-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	tim_		next thing is to test if 3D acceleration is working for you, but someone else will have to say how to do that
2011-01-14T06:33:00.000Z	dsdeiz		hm sec. lemme check
2011-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	I think if you install a package called mesa-utils, and run a tool called glxgears you can see if everythings working nicely
2011-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	tim_		but honestly, this stuff mostly plug and plays these days
2011-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	dsdeiz	tim_	gotcha, will install that. xserver-xorg-video-intel is installed, i also see the word intel in /var/log/Xorg.1.log and /var/log/Xorg.failsafe.log
2011-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	tim_	dsdeiz	I'd pretty much assume it's fine at this point, unless something goes wrong
