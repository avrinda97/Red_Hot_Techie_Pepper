2011-03-21T13:45:00.000Z	Adkq093lk		hi everyone, I'd like to know whats the current sandy bridge support status on ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 if anyone tried them I'd like to know if there are any issues, considering also that im interested in using the integrated graphics 
2011-03-21T13:45:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	I heard the latest kernel updates 'upgraded performance on sandy bridge processors' so i assume it works already.
2011-03-21T13:46:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	works well or works enough?
2011-03-21T13:47:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	That i'm not sure of, i heard the windows performance was a tad better than the linux perf, but you'd have to try yourself, should use a live CD to test it
2011-03-21T13:47:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	i dont have it right now, was getting infos before buying, you think it would be worth switching from arrandale to sandy bridge? (i can give you processors models, i have em already)
2011-03-21T13:48:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	I heard good things about the sandy bridge processors, i don't know the fine details, but afaik the performance is always an upgrade versus the previous versions of the i series
2011-03-21T13:49:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	sorry i didnt specify, i meant to ask if it was worth "stability wise", i mean arrandale is supposed to work 100% isnt it?
2011-03-21T13:50:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	I'm sure there's reviews out there that'll clarify, and 'stability wise' i'm sure it'll work fine, depends on what you mean by 'stable'
2011-03-21T13:51:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	reviews about speed and performance? i saw those but noone talked about stability lol, and by stable i mean that if one day i decide to go play assault cube it shouldnt bother me, i seen on forums that 3d acceleration is a lil tricky to get and sensors dont work too well, is it still true?
2011-03-21T13:53:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	I'm afraid i don't know anything about that, it's normal that new devices need a little time to get proper drivers for linux, but the platform itself is quite stable i'm sure
2011-03-21T13:53:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	thank you very much, very helpful, gotta make up my mind now :D
2011-03-21T13:53:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	Good luck, and no problem ^^
2011-03-21T13:54:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	awkard thing is that i recently bought an arrandale pc, and now for same price they re giving sb ones lol
2011-03-21T13:55:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	The new series are a lot cheaper yea, i seen that too, and faster i heard, i can't say i'd complain about things getting cheaper though =p
2011-03-21T13:56:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	if you want to take a look mine is a dell vostro 3700, 2 weeks after i purchased they came out with 3750 with sb lol
2011-03-21T13:57:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	I bought the 5970 ~5 months ago for 500 euros, now the 69xx series is out, which are a lot faster AND cheaper :P
2011-03-21T13:59:00.000Z	xarinatan		Hey, i'm having trouble getting SVN working on my ubuntu server, i constantly get "Cannot open SVN filesystem", can anyone point me in the right direction?
2011-03-21T13:59:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	thing is that i knew 3750 was coming out but i said "sb is fairly new, probably wont be that supported", as i bought it i started seeing support lol
2011-03-21T14:00:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	tried a cleanup?
2011-03-21T14:00:00.000Z	xarinatan	Adkq093lk	It's a fresh repo, no files added yet
2011-03-21T14:01:00.000Z	xarinatan		I'm suspecting it has something to do with the fact i'm saving the files on a cifs mounted filesystem
2011-03-21T14:01:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	may be that
2011-03-21T14:02:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	google said "cifs has a lot of problems with svn" (just googled it a lil, im not that informed about svn troubleshooting lol)
2011-03-21T14:04:00.000Z	Adkq093lk	xarinatan	maybe this may help you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1289850/svn-repository-on-windows-network-share
