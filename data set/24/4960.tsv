2006-11-30T08:19:00.000Z	Lapfunc		what's the best tool for making and restoring images of partitions?
2006-11-30T08:19:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	GNU PARTED to make and testdisk to restore
2006-11-30T08:20:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	oh parted ghosts drives?  didn't know that
2006-11-30T08:21:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	You want the latest version of testisk to restore if you want to be able to list the files in the partitions from a list
2006-11-30T08:22:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	can't find any ghosting functionality in the parted manual...
2006-11-30T08:23:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	PARTED to create and testdisk to restore as said...
2006-11-30T08:23:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	testdisk <--- package.
2006-11-30T08:23:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	i don't see any creation of partition images in the parted manual either
2006-11-30T08:25:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	you think i want to create partitions and repair them don't you?
2006-11-30T08:26:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	I think you want to making and restoring images of partitions.
2006-11-30T08:26:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	You want like Norton Ghost or what?
2006-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	there's nothing about images at all in either parted or testdisk manuals
2006-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	yes like norton ghost
2006-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	I moved / to /tmp when I was running / as system so you should be able to tar / to /image.tar.gz for instance and untar it when you feel for it.
2006-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	hm...
2006-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	interesting
2006-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	If nothing else, boot a live cd and make the operation from there (100% safe).
2006-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	sounds like it would work.  i'll try it, thanks :)
2006-11-30T08:35:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	Yes, if the device does not require separate drivers installed.
2006-11-30T08:36:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	surely though ubuntu would detect and install certain drivers/configurations at installation time?
2006-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	But I mean If you would use SCSI with fiberchannels for instance.
2006-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	lost me there :P oh well, i'll get on with this imaging
2006-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	dbe	Lapfunc	Good luck, let the GNU be with you.
2006-11-30T08:40:00.000Z	Lapfunc	dbe	lol, thanks
