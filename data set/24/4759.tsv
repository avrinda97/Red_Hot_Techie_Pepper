2008-09-04T04:25:00.000Z	coz_		hey gys..lyX is in the hardy repos but uninstallable  anyone have a workaround for this?
2008-09-04T04:25:00.000Z	unop	coz_	what happens when you try and uninstall it?
2008-09-04T04:26:00.000Z	coz_	unop	  well it doesnt install so I really cant uninstall it yet :)
2008-09-04T04:26:00.000Z	unop	coz_	run this command and put the output up on a pastebin for us to see.  sudo aptitude install lyx
2008-09-04T04:28:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 here you go   http://pastebin.ca/1193135
2008-09-04T04:28:00.000Z	unop	coz_	all of it please.
2008-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 that is all of  sudo apt-get install lyx
2008-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 that is the complete readout
2008-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	unop	coz_	i said aptitude not apt-get
2008-09-04T04:29:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 actually dont mix aptitude with apt  and I started with apt  but hold on
2008-09-04T04:30:00.000Z	unop	coz_	there are no downsides to using aptitude and apt-get interchangeably
2008-09-04T04:35:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 ok  sudo aptitude -s  install lyx  read out   http://pastebin.ca/1193144
2008-09-04T04:36:00.000Z	unop	coz_	are you sure you have all the ubuntu repositories enabled?  it looks to me like that's the cause of the problem
2008-09-04T04:37:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 I am positive
2008-09-04T04:37:00.000Z	unop	coz_	run sudo aptitude update and try again
2008-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 completely updated
2008-09-04T04:38:00.000Z	unop	coz_	try installing lyx again
2008-09-04T04:39:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 nope same issue  depencies that are not installable   thats ok I will do some research online and get back to you
2010-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	unop	coz_	the effect is the same actually, in both cases the window manager is terminated and in getting that signal sends the same signal to all it's children
2010-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	coz_	unop	  not quite guy... it was disabled for a reason   ctrl+alt+F1  is much much safer
2010-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	unop	coz_	actually, the reason it was disabled is arguable - I'd say it's so that one can't inadvertently kill the X session using ctrl-alt-backspace
2010-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	unop	coz_	and it's not disabled universally - only a few distros do it
2010-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	coz_	unop	 well as I recall several years ago ,,,, ,mnay people coming in here complaingin about gnome and nautilus errors because they used ctrl+altr+baclspace and the errors were quite clear that they were not shut down properly
2010-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	unop	coz_	that may very well be - but that doesn't validate another way of terminating X as better, if you get where I'm coming from.
