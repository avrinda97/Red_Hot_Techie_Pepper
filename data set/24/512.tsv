2011-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	that is one handsome post, I must say, I don't know the answer, but, could it have something to do with entries? as in only the first 2-3 partions show up by default? long shot
2011-07-12T09:56:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	how would i go about changing that?
2011-07-12T09:56:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	ps thank you
2011-07-12T09:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	I don't think that is the prob, what is special about 2 of those hard drives?
2011-07-12T09:58:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	Windows 7 is installed on that 1 hard drive but it is split into 2 partitions
2011-07-12T09:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	the ones that don't show, special how?
2011-07-12T09:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	how many physical drives are there?
2011-07-12T09:59:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	 4
2011-07-12T10:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	googled it? usb install hidden partions?
2011-07-12T10:01:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	doing so now, previously I came across a similar post labeled solved but not solution was given
2011-07-12T10:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	want to try something for shits and giggles, unplug one of the drives now showing, see if the missing drive/s show up?
2011-07-12T10:04:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	i unplugged 3 hard drives and only left the one I wanted to install to and as a result it did not show up
2011-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	you are installing 11.04, have you tried the cd/dvd, not the live, the one with repair/install
2011-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	no but I will give it a shot in a second
2011-07-12T10:07:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	by the way, i'm in GParted and the hard drive is showing up split into two just like it did in windows
2011-07-12T10:07:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	and I've never hidden a drive so I dont know why it would be that...
2011-07-12T10:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	nothing to lose by trying the dvd/cd
2011-07-12T10:08:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	right burning now, thanks for helping
2011-07-12T10:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	I am talking about the 'alternate' cd, btw
2011-07-12T10:10:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	what do you mean?  So i have the default download from ubuntu.com of 11.04 64 bit, burnt to a cd right?
2011-07-12T10:10:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	not sure, the default is something like 'desktop-11.04' I assume, and that is not it
2011-07-12T10:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	saruji_	the one I am talking about http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ubuntu-11.04-alternate-amd64.iso
2011-07-12T10:13:00.000Z	saruji_	almoxarife	downloading it
