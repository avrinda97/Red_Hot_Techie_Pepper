2006-12-13T16:41:00.000Z	serishema		rebecca: i would too if i wasn't a broke student.
2006-12-13T16:43:00.000Z	serishema		where'd the automatic LAMP install option go in server 6.10?
2006-12-13T16:44:00.000Z	serishema		never mind i guess i can just install apache and stuff later, would probably need to be manual since i want mod_mono and all that ASP .NET compatable stuff
2006-12-13T16:45:00.000Z	serishema		helpmeee: sounds similar to the problem i had running the latest ubuntu on virtual pc, have you tried doing ctrl+alt+f1  and then editing /etc/X11/Xorg.conf to specify different graphics settings
2006-12-13T16:46:00.000Z	serishema		that's even easier.
2006-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	serishema		sounds like there's click through wizards and stuff in linux now. My last experience with linux was like 4 years ago.
2006-12-13T16:48:00.000Z	serishema		helpmee: if you are already at a prompt, you don't need to
2006-12-13T16:50:00.000Z	serishema		pie-rate: and sftp can easily saturate a 100Mbit link on anything better than a p100
2006-12-13T16:52:00.000Z	serishema		nvidias site probably has their binary driver
2006-12-13T16:54:00.000Z	serishema		does anyone know what the minimum connection speed and latency for remote X to work useably is. Specifically would it have a chance of being useable via a 3G/UMTS datacard?
2006-12-13T16:55:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	depends  on what you mean by usable... you can do data/simple things, but no games or videos... there will be some lag
2006-12-13T16:55:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	you also may need to choose compression/encoding and limiting the colors
2006-12-13T16:56:00.000Z	serishema	nothlit	sounds like it would probably anoy me if i was editing code over it and such.
2006-12-13T16:56:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	probably, use a console editor?
2006-12-13T16:57:00.000Z	serishema	nothlit	i suppose multiple ssh windows would do the same job as remote X actually if i think about what i'd use it to do
2006-12-13T16:58:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	just use one ssh session + screen lol
2006-12-13T16:59:00.000Z	serishema	nothlit	i'm trying to avoid the overhead of virtual pc when doing linux stuff on my laptop you see. Maybe there's a way i could get the ubuntu environment to run ontop of colinux?
2006-12-13T17:01:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	if you're trying to do ssh, theres putty, and colinux easily lets you install gentoo debian and (red hat?) i think
2006-12-13T17:02:00.000Z	serishema	nothlit	thanks for the info, that's quite a bit of choice with colinux
2006-12-13T17:26:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	if you have problems, make sure you uses smbpasswd
2006-12-13T17:26:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	used*
2006-12-13T17:26:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	and smbfs is pretty great
2006-12-13T17:47:00.000Z	serishema	nothlit	as long as it doesn't demand to be reactivated and then claim your academic license is no good any more :-P
2006-12-13T17:49:00.000Z	nothlit	serishema	rooofl
