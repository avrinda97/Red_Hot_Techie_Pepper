2010-02-25T00:07:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Greets!  Is it normal for Ubuntu to hang while installing?
2010-02-25T00:09:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Also are there any issues with DMI when installing Ubuntu?
2010-02-25T00:10:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Whell!  It is hanging. I don't like it.
2010-02-25T00:10:00.000Z	Curly_Q		DMI is Desktop Management Interface.
2010-02-25T00:11:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Thanks for the encouragement.
2010-02-25T00:12:00.000Z	Curly_Q		I just did a DoD erasure of the hard drive.
2010-02-25T00:12:00.000Z	Curly_Q		The only thing I need to know is does Ubuntu need a MBR record of Windows to install or a disk formatting?
2010-02-25T00:13:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	The Ubuntu CD can partition and format disks, if thats what you're asking.
2010-02-25T00:25:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	No it does not.
2010-02-25T00:26:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Could you explain why you think it requires Windows to install?
2010-02-25T00:27:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Red Hat is not not Ubuntu.
2010-02-25T00:28:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	If you're having problems with the Live CD (desktop CD) you can use the alternate CD, which is able to install on computers which may have issues running the Live session.
2010-02-25T00:29:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Such failures have *nothing* to do with Microsoft Windows being installed on the drive.
2010-02-25T00:32:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	We're here to answer support questions, not listen to complaints.  Please try to stay constructive :)
2010-02-25T00:42:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	No.  Sometimes burned cd images can be corrupt due to burning at high speed, this has nothing to do with Ubuntu.  I'd ensure that your CD was burned properly by doing the "Check CD for Defects" option at the boot menu.
2010-02-25T00:44:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	If it was, then there might just be an incompatibility between the LiveCD and your hardware. This can be due to very new hardware in some cases.  You can use the Alternate CD to install Ubuntu which does not create a live environment.
2010-02-25T00:45:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	There can be CD defects regardless of whether you can use Windows explorer to look at the disk contents.
2010-03-01T22:16:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Perhaps you ashould ask in #centos, not #ubuntu
2010-04-06T18:20:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	acicula: to clarify: .. is parent directory
2010-04-06T18:23:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Only .. and . exist.
2010-12-28T20:28:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Try ##windows
2010-12-28T20:31:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	Well this channel is for Ubuntu Support only, not discussion.  Try #ubuntu-offtopic if you just want to chat.
2010-12-28T20:31:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Pici	No problem. I didn't know that.
2011-01-18T01:44:00.000Z	Pici	Curly_Q	What? You don't need to reformat if you want to do an update, thats ridiculous.  And you there aren't any architecture changes happening.
