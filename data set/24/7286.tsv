2005-02-25T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	yes
2005-05-10T12:36:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	using esd or alsa, and with firefox?
2005-05-10T12:36:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libesd.so.0 /usr/lib/libesd.so.1
2005-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	are you using an .asoundrc?
2005-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	if so, get rid of it
2005-05-10T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	well if you're sure that's what caused the problem, revert your change
2005-05-10T12:38:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	erase the libesd.so.1 symlink

2005-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	so don't use esd if it annoys you
2005-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	tell gstreamer-properties to use alsa for the output sink
2005-05-10T12:46:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	then tell each audio application to use alsa
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	I just told you...
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	System>Preferences>MultiMedia Systems Selector>Default Audio Sink>ALSA
2005-05-10T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	then you'll need to configure each audio program to use ALSA instead of ESD
2005-05-10T12:49:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	did you pkill esd?
2005-05-10T12:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mpq	how are you testing?
