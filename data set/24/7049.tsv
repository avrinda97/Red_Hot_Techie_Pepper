2005-05-07T14:20:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	theyre gonna be nice with the next upgrade
2005-05-07T14:21:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	perhaps with bluetooth 2.0 across the board
2005-05-07T14:21:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	I'm really hoping that they put 9600XT's in them
2005-05-07T14:21:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	i totally agree
2005-05-07T14:22:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	they probably fear too much competition with the powermacs
2005-05-07T14:22:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	if they don't put in the XT's they're retarded
2005-05-07T14:27:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	check it out: http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031015/index.html
2005-05-07T14:27:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	im reading that now : D
2005-05-07T14:28:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	thinksecrets saying that there will be a 9600xt
2005-05-07T14:28:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	so.. theres a pretty good chance of that happeneing
2005-05-07T14:29:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	that will be SOOOOOO nice
2005-05-07T14:29:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	512MB RAM on all models, bluetooth 2.0, not to mention a proc. boost
2005-05-07T14:30:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	why?
2005-05-07T14:30:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	memory is memory, imho.
2005-05-07T14:31:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	people say the same about many things.
2005-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	compare a mcdonalds cheeseburger with a chili's or TGI Friday's cheeseburger
2005-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	synd	abstractism	and then theres the price difference, again
2005-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	abstractism	synd	you get what yuo pay for
