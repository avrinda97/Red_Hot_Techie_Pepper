2006-10-14T14:47:00.000Z	rasket		hi, i have a question about ubuntu installation
2006-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	rasket		btw. ubuntu realy changed my opion about linux distri
2006-10-14T14:50:00.000Z	rasket		is it possible to install ubuntu out of the live dvd ?
2006-10-14T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	yes
2006-10-14T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	isn't there an install icon on the desktop?
2006-10-14T14:57:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	no, only cdrom and my usb stick
2006-10-14T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	and there is no install option at boot?
2006-10-14T15:00:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	ah, you must not have burned the DVD slow enough, or some other reason for a bad burn
2006-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	then I suppose theres no ubiquity on the DVD
2006-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	seems so :-(    ubiquity ?
2006-10-14T15:02:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	ubiquity is the installer the liveCD uses
2006-10-14T15:03:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	no, could not find a file named ubiquity; can i download a basic ubuntu or the bad package to a drive and switch there during install ?
2006-10-14T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	you can download the alternate ISO and install from that, yeah.
2006-10-14T15:05:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	or, just re-burn the DVD, if you burned > 4x
2006-10-14T15:06:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	unfortunately i only have 4gb partition to use i will try if its enough space
2006-10-14T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	then yeah. grab the alternate ISO and use that
2006-10-14T15:06:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	hmm do i have a dvd burner ?
2006-10-14T15:07:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	er... I dont know?
2006-10-14T15:07:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	sw to burn a dvd, not the hardware :-)
2006-10-14T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	ah, yes.  download the ISO and ubuntu knows what to do with it ;)
2006-10-14T15:09:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	ok, but i could not find an application to burn cd/dvd around my desktop .. sure ubuntu knows what to do ?
2006-10-14T15:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rasket	yeah
2006-10-14T15:11:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	thanks i will try this, cu and have a nice day :-)
2006-10-14T15:29:00.000Z	rasket	Flannel	sry, but i ran into a problem, i cant write on the mounted disk, but can format it
