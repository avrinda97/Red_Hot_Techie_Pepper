2006-11-01T06:33:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	hold one
2006-11-01T06:29:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	are those downloaded drivers or from CD?
2006-11-01T06:30:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	do 'lspci' and find your card write down the hex address
2006-11-01T06:31:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	'lspci -n' and write down the numbers in a format like xxxx:xxxx
2006-11-01T06:35:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	AlReece I cant connect to the ndiswrapper wiki for some reason
2006-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	AlReece on that site, you will find somewhere that has a list of drivers listed out with that xxxx:xxxx address
2006-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	AlReece those are the drivers specific for your card
2006-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	AlReece on another note, the method described at http://bcm43xx.berlios.de is much better than ndiswrapper
2006-11-01T06:40:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	anyway, find the driver that matches that second address code and everything will pop up hunky dory, has the last 3 times I'v followed that path
2006-11-01T06:42:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	the list is there
2006-11-01T06:42:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	I helped someone with this last week and the list was there
2006-11-01T06:46:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	here's the link http://ftp.us.dell.com/network/R115321.EXE
2006-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	glad that got you going
2006-11-01T07:27:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	have you been into your iwconfig and set it up there?
2006-11-01T07:29:00.000Z	TGPO	icoo	and all of its other info is correct?
