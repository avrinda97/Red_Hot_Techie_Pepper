2010-08-22T12:41:00.000Z	MACscr		how can i find out what port #'s processes are currently listening on? lsof is giving me responses like 'TCP *:submission (LISTEN)'. I want the actual numbers, etc
2010-08-22T12:42:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	sudo netstat -np --inet
2010-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	sudo is required to find out which program is using a port, -n stops it from resolving port numbers to service names, -p shows the program, --inet limits to just ports, not sockets.
2010-08-22T12:43:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	it seems to only be listing ports that currently have a connection though. For example its not listing port 25, even though smtp is listening on it
2010-08-22T12:44:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	oh, duh, sorry. Throw -l on there too
2010-08-22T12:45:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	thanks for the info and explanations
2010-09-11T11:51:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	sudo aptitude purge ~c
2010-09-11T11:51:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	~c means "all removed but not purged packages"
2010-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	the UUID of the relevant partition. You can see partition UUIDs with "sudo blkid"
2010-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	whats the point of the UUID? can i remove it? seems like it could be a pain in the but when doing recoveries
2010-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	UUIDs stay the same if your hard drive ordering changes, /dev/sda (or whatever) notation doesn't
2010-10-13T12:05:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	if that's not an issue, and you're trying to get things working, you don't have to use them. I don't remember enough grub1 to know how to set up the alternative, though.
2010-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	why im worried is that i just upgraded from 8.04 LTS to 10.4 LTS and last time i tried, it wouldnt reboot and had issues finding the partition for some odd reason. This is grub2 obviously.
2010-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	As I understand it, 8.04 to 10.04 upgrades stick with GRUB1. I don't have a web browser handy to look at your pastebin, so if it says otherwise, never mind.
2010-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	more specifically, this is the error i got last time: http://pastebin.com/VAzWqiZW
2010-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	really? i swear its grub two since its uses menu.lst. I always used grub.conf with grub1
2010-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	umm. GRUB2 uses grub.cfg and GRUB1 uses menu.lst...
2010-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	since you know what your talking about, mind checking out that pastebin to save me from myself? =P
2010-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	as I said, I don't have a web browser handy to do so.
2010-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	ah, np, thanks
2011-02-25T12:34:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	because people search for "Ubuntu" more than they search for "Linux"?
2011-02-25T12:34:00.000Z	rww	MACscr	it's just a search term chart, not a usage chart.
2011-02-25T12:34:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	yeah, i guess i should have looked closer at the article
2011-04-12T08:28:00.000Z	MACscr	rww	minimum maybe. i was talking about actually being respectful
