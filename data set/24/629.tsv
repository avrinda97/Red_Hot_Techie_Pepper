2011-09-17T01:06:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	sounds like something got typoed. can you !paste the terminal session
2011-09-17T00:59:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	apt-file can help here
2011-09-17T01:00:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	~:>  apt-file search toc2cue cdrdao: /usr/bin/toc2cue
2011-09-17T01:00:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	thanks
2011-09-17T01:05:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	I did" sudo apt-get install apt-file     and it replied missing destination file after apt-file. Do I just need to put in an absolute path and use any folder?
2011-09-17T01:07:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	apt-get not apt=get
2011-09-17T01:12:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	I ran the command and got a box that said, "apt-file update needed" when I ran that action, it gave me another box that said, "There was an error in creating the child process for this Terminal."
2011-09-17T01:12:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	again a weird error so I'd like to see the terminal session
2011-09-17T01:17:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	can I put screen shots in paste bin, because there is basically no terminal text
2011-09-17T01:29:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	here is a paste of the apt-file result. Do I just need to unzip the file, or do I need to run something to
2011-09-17T01:30:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	you didn't give a link
2011-09-17T01:30:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/691078/
2011-09-17T01:31:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	sorry "apt-file search toc2cue" is what you type cdrdao is the answer
2011-09-17T01:33:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	sorry I'm just not familiar with this is cdrdao a repository where I can get toc2cue?
2011-09-17T01:33:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	no its the program you install. apt-file search fileneeded; suggests that package /path/to/fileneeded; so sudo apt-get install package
2011-09-17T01:34:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	thanks
2011-09-17T05:09:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	did you not install cdrdao
2011-09-17T05:10:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	apt-get couldn't find it. I think it's because I don't have the repository that I need
2011-09-17T05:11:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	man you must have a lot of spare time to sit here and help people all day!
2011-09-17T05:12:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	im avoiding work
2011-09-17T05:13:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	well I hope that works out for you! LOL
2011-09-17T05:21:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	I can't believe it. It was in synaptic all the time. I ran apt-get install cdrdao but it didn't work. I didn't know that if it didn't work in apt-get that it could still be in synaptic.
2011-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	nunuyabiz	escott	thanks for your help. now maybe I can put my iso on my hard drive.
2011-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	escott	nunuyabiz	very odd
