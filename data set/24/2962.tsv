2009-03-11T05:47:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	type "ifconfig" at the command prompt
2009-03-11T05:50:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	it will be very easy to get your wireless working again
2009-03-11T05:50:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	let's troubleshoot
2009-03-11T05:51:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	im gonna install 8.10 will you be on in for a couple hours? i need to update so it will be messed up so i can fix it
2009-03-11T05:51:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	what version are you running?
2009-03-11T05:52:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	I had trouble with some wired connections....but 8.10 fixed my problems
2009-03-11T05:52:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	8.10 is where my wired internet messed up. after the first update it stopped working
2009-03-11T05:54:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	(1) have you tried rebooting after the updates?  (2) what does "ifconfig" give,  (3) also try "route -n" at the terminal
2009-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	ok np
2009-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	will you be here in about 2 hours?
2009-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	there is a good chance i will be here
2009-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	actually, can you just tell me what update not to do?
2009-03-11T05:57:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	i am not sure which update not to do.  I am certain the problem could be fixed in less time than a full install
2009-03-11T05:57:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	ahhhhh that could be it
2009-03-11T05:58:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	yeah i would reinstall to get back to 8.10 if you want stability
2009-03-11T05:59:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	im gonna reinstall, update, and come back here with a nearby wireless
2009-03-11T06:41:00.000Z	zaccour	braddcadd	you there?
2009-03-11T07:07:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	i'm here
2009-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	braddcadd	zaccour	i have no idea which one...can you give me a list?  or can you select one package at a time until it crashes?  or can you just not update?
