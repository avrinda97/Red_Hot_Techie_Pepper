2011-02-20T03:07:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	My computer won't connect to the wireless internet is my problem
2011-02-20T03:07:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	ok.. so... what is your wireless device, jesus..
2011-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	a router
2011-02-20T03:13:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	"00:12:0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset (rev 01)"
2011-04-27T02:06:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	what are you trying to do w/ the old dell?
2011-04-27T02:07:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	just make it wireless usable for my little sisters
2011-04-27T02:07:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	i imagine a machine that old, wireless should probably be easy.. i'm guessing its a broadcom.. have you figured out what device it is yet, or have you got that far
2011-04-27T02:27:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	usually you can find that option by right clicking the networking applet.
2011-04-27T02:28:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	which driver did you install and attempt to get to work?
2011-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	the B43 Wireless Driver (which worked last time when I was using Linux Mint)
2011-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	did you try modprobing the driver?
2011-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	I'm sorry but, what? How can I do this?
2011-04-27T02:29:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	hang on
2011-04-27T02:30:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	copy paste these two commands one at a time in the terminal... http://pastebin.com/chRLy3Ws
2011-04-27T02:31:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	then afterwards, wait about 10-15sec, and see if your wireless opens.
2011-04-27T02:32:00.000Z	J697	KM0201	for both I got the same result "FATAL: Module wl not found." sounds bad :(
2011-04-27T02:33:00.000Z	KM0201	J697	yeah, somethin isn't right... you don't have the driver.
