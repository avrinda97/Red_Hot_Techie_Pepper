2012-03-15T14:40:00.000Z	riktking		yeh i have a new hdd, want to clone my system onto it, any idea on how to do this with the bad sectors
2012-03-15T14:40:00.000Z	riktking		i know, but the drive in the system is working, just too damn small
2012-03-15T14:40:00.000Z	riktking		(60 gig) so i have brought a new drive (160gig) and want to clone onto it
2012-03-15T14:41:00.000Z	riktking		clonezilla said no
2012-03-15T14:41:00.000Z	riktking		it failed
2012-03-15T14:41:00.000Z	riktking		i know
2012-03-15T14:42:00.000Z	riktking		soi cant clone a drive with the bad sectors, even tho the drive is working fine
2012-03-15T14:42:00.000Z	riktking		oh ok
2012-03-15T14:42:00.000Z	riktking		ok
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	alexbligh1	riktking	use dd with the noerror flag
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	riktking		thanks guys
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	alexbligh1	riktking	obviously you will copy the corrupt sectors as corrupt data
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	alexbligh1		but you will get the whole thing off, and then might well be able to restore using a file based method
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	riktking		but then will i be able to fix um on the new hdd?
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	alexbligh1		(rsync)
2012-03-15T14:43:00.000Z	alexbligh1		My preferred method would be:
2012-03-15T14:44:00.000Z	alexbligh1		dd with noerror, which will give you an image with your bad sectors with bad data in but will not error
2012-03-15T14:44:00.000Z	alexbligh1		then try and mount it. You might need fsck
2012-03-15T14:44:00.000Z	alexbligh1		then rsync -a to a freshly formatted filesystem
2012-03-15T14:44:00.000Z	alexbligh1		you will need to reinstall grub etc
2012-03-15T14:45:00.000Z	alexbligh1		you might well have files with corrupted content, but your metadata (directory structure etc.) will then be ok.
2012-03-15T14:45:00.000Z	alexbligh1	riktking	I thought there was a dd that retried after resetting the HD, but I can't find it now
2012-03-15T14:45:00.000Z	riktking	alexbligh1	thanks for the advice
