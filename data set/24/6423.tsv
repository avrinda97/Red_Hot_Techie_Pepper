2006-03-06T15:09:00.000Z	iceman		anyone know why i cant get a sound applett on my toolbar ?
2006-03-06T15:09:00.000Z	sbalneav	iceman	What applet, and do you have working sound?
2006-03-06T15:10:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	sound works, but cannot add a volume control to the Gnome panel
2006-03-06T15:11:00.000Z	sbalneav	iceman	has your userid been added to the sound group in /etc/group?
2006-03-06T15:11:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	how to check ?
2006-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	sbalneav		from a command prompt: grep iceman /etc/group
2006-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	sbalneav		One of the groups should be sound
2006-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	iceman		audio is listed ?
2006-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	yea audio is there
2006-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	sbalneav		ok
2006-03-06T15:13:00.000Z	sbalneav		What happens when you try to add it, do you get an error?
2006-03-06T15:13:00.000Z	sbalneav		Or does it just not appear?
2006-03-06T15:13:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	no, just it fails to add ... nothing
2006-03-06T15:14:00.000Z	sbalneav	iceman	is your userid upgraded from an older version of gnome/ubuntu?  I'm wondering if you haven't got something mucked up in your gnome panel files.
2006-03-06T15:15:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	no is a fresh install of breezey .... but did get a error in the install failed to read a file from the cd ...
2006-03-06T15:15:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	dvd / cd-rw drive i think a bit to fast ..
2006-03-06T15:15:00.000Z	sbalneav	iceman	well, then you've probably got a corrupted install.
2006-03-06T15:16:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	so guess i can install kubuntu desktop, and then reinstall gnome
2006-03-06T15:16:00.000Z	sbalneav		D[a] : Did you download the newer windows driver like I told you to?
2006-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	sbalneav	iceman	actually, doing an apt-get upgrade should fix it.
2006-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	no updates ...
2006-03-06T15:17:00.000Z	sbalneav		D[a] : yes.  It will probably use the windows drivers under ndiswrappers.
2006-03-06T15:18:00.000Z	sbalneav		Thats why I said to download the latest windows drivers.
2006-03-06T15:18:00.000Z	iceman	sbalneav	i'll install KDE
