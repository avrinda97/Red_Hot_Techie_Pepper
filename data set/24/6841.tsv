2005-10-10T05:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	bimberi	was under the impression that -i meant clear the environment.....
2005-10-10T05:59:00.000Z	bimberi	kbrooks	yes it simulates a root logon shell, but sometimes that's desirable

2005-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	bimberi	kbrooks	perhaps another process (a zombie cupsd?) is using the port - sudo netstat -plunt
2005-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	bimberi	i restarted cupsd
2005-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	bimberi	kbrooks	k .  Just a thought.  You could stop cupsd and do the netstat cmd to check for sure
2005-11-20T10:21:00.000Z	bimberi	kbrooks	/etc/fstab (you will need to run mkswap on the device too)
