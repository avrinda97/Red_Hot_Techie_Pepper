2007-10-18T07:55:00.000Z	markusy		hello... i'm trying to get an ati x1600 pro 512mb agp working with linux.. i'm using 2.6.22-14 with the latest fglrx module (8.40.4) loaded.. everything should be working fine looking at the xorg log (no errors and everything appears to load fine) but when X starts the screen goes black... any ideas?
2007-10-18T07:56:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	take a look at your Xorg log file in /var/log, you may find some answers there
2007-10-18T07:56:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	there isnt anything
2007-10-18T07:57:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	are you trying to run the desktop effects?
2007-10-18T07:57:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	no i can't run them with vesa
2007-10-18T07:58:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	i've also tried using the ubuntu fglrx restricted-modules
2007-10-18T07:59:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	Let me get this straight. You've installed the fglrx modules but you are trying to run X with the vesa driver?
2007-10-18T07:59:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	no i'm trying to run x with the fglrx driver
2007-10-18T08:00:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	Ok, so are you wanting to have the fglrx driver running with the desktop effects?
2007-10-18T08:00:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	i don't really care about desktop effects to be honest
2007-10-18T08:01:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	My advise to you is to install the ATI graphics drivers manually (NOT from apt or synaptic) from the ATI website.
2007-10-18T08:01:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	i have
2007-10-18T08:01:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	Ok, please walk me through the process you went through to install the driver?
2007-10-18T08:05:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	what was the make and model of the card?
2007-10-18T08:05:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	ok, gimme a sec to look something up
2007-10-18T08:09:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	ok, does the file /usr/shar/fglrx exist?
2007-10-18T08:11:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	the last line in the xorg log is : (II) fglrx(0): [DRI] installation complete
2007-10-18T08:13:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	does your xorg.conf file load the agpgart module?
2007-10-18T08:14:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	the agpgart module is loaded by the kernel

2007-10-18T08:21:00.000Z	CITguy	markusy	try:     sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-10-18T08:25:00.000Z	markusy	CITguy	set the correct busid in the xorg config brb
