2012-04-24T20:46:00.000Z	silvermir		hello can somebody help me pls ?
2012-04-24T20:47:00.000Z	silvermir		i have an external drive
2012-04-24T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	ask and see
2012-04-24T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	can you give the output of:  sudo fdisk -l ; lsb_release -a; uname -a        please use a pastebin to host
2012-04-24T21:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	I never said to run lsb_release or uname with sudo, it's not needed (but the output is the same)
2012-04-24T21:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	if you use sudo when it's not needed, you can damage your OS
2012-04-24T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	seems the device is /dev/sdb1    when you last unplugged the device, did you use the safe remove feature?
2012-04-24T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	or did you just pull it out?
2012-04-24T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	seems your Linux partitions are not listed either...
2012-04-24T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	what file system does the storage use?
2012-04-24T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	when you last unplugged it, did you use 'safely remov'?
2012-04-24T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	yes, it has the safe remove feature, did you use it?
2012-04-24T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	oh dear, not good
2012-04-24T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	if you manually mount it, is it ok? If you only see /dev/sdg  you may be able to use dd_rescure and take an image then mount that
2012-04-24T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	it may be dying or dead.
2012-04-24T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	you can't mount /dev/sdg  its a drive, not a partition
2012-04-24T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	you'll mount /dev/sdg1
2012-04-24T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	you may need to use dd_rescue to make an image then mount that
2012-04-24T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	is anne your username?
2012-04-24T21:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	if /home/anne is a folder then it won't work. You'll need to write to an actual file
2012-04-24T21:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	if that's no good then I'd use Windows to copy the data
2012-04-24T21:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	sudo apt-get install ddrescue; dd_rescue if=/dev/sdg of=~/output.iso
2012-04-24T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	try rebooting, see if its redetected
2012-04-24T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	silvermir	if its not working in WIndows then its probably dead
