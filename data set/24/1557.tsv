2009-11-20T19:34:00.000Z	renata		Can I newbie like me establish a SSH connection for data transfer between xubuntu and opensuse? I need to connect two laptops on the same network
2009-11-20T19:34:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	sure, why not? ssh (ip)
2009-11-20T19:35:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	what does it take?
2009-11-20T19:36:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	ssh is the package name
2009-11-20T19:37:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	Ok, I will install it along with openssh-server. Is that right?
2009-11-20T19:38:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	are there anymore packages I need to have to start process?
2009-11-20T19:38:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	ssh only I think
2009-11-20T19:41:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	sorry for bothering, I appreaciate your help. I would be glad if you could tell me what's next after install?
2009-11-20T19:41:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	'ssh (ip of host)'
2009-11-20T19:42:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	in terminal? is 'host' another computer I want to connect?
2009-11-20T19:43:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	yes to both questions :)
2009-11-20T19:46:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	did that, but nothing really happened...
2009-11-20T19:48:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	what exactly happened?
2009-11-20T19:50:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	another line appeared
2009-11-20T19:51:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	a blank line or the prompt?
2009-11-20T19:51:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	the line where I can enter another command
2009-11-20T19:52:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	hmm...
2009-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	I am on xubuntu, not ubuntu, btw
2009-11-20T19:54:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	what about 'ssh (username)@(ip of host)'?
2009-11-20T19:55:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	the same...
2009-11-20T19:56:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	sorry, I don't know... do you have the ssh server/host on the host?
2009-11-20T19:58:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	I guess so, btw, Ive managed to connect this machine (xubuntu 9.10) from opensuse, Ive typed sftp://(ip of this machine/ in nautilus.
2009-11-20T19:59:00.000Z	folliculated34_	renata	I don't really know why, sorry.
2009-11-20T20:00:00.000Z	renata	folliculated34_	thanks for you help
