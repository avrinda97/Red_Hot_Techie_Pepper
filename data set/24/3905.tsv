2007-09-12T16:11:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	what went wrong?
2007-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	A2t3c13	bascule	were you helping me?
2007-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	they are ok, just mwans you installed Qt stuff, probably via a kde app
2007-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	I don't kow whats gone wrong
2007-09-12T16:16:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	nah no restore points
2007-09-12T16:18:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	videla won't be, you installed from source
2007-09-12T16:21:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	make uninstall, not all source builds support it though
2007-09-12T16:22:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	cd vidalia-??? and then say sudo make uninstal
2007-09-12T16:24:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	follow the instrunctions that you did to the point that you ran make install, and then run make uninstall
2007-09-12T16:25:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	I can't psychically know the directory structure on your machine, you made the dir that is called viladia-? some where, goto that dir
2007-09-12T16:26:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	sure, if it supports make uninstall, if not then you will have to put up with the extra files lying around until you develop the skills and knowledge to delete them manually :))
2007-09-12T16:27:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	well you live and learn ... :)
2007-09-12T16:30:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	no it isn't unheard of
2007-09-12T16:32:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	lol, but it is a win technolgy, I think new OSX will have it too
2007-09-12T16:33:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	well lets call it a learning experience
2007-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	you are learning, that is how we do
2007-09-12T16:37:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	but just for the record insta;;ing from source is not somethng that you shoul do unless you know the full consequences
2007-09-12T16:53:00.000Z	A2t3c13	bascule	what was it again sudo make uninstall or was it sudo make remove?
2007-09-12T05:38:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	it didn't install you have nothing to worry aboyt, just remove the vidalia directory :)
2007-09-12T05:39:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	as soon as you see ./configure there is compiling going on :)
2007-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	bascule	A2t3c13	the gui didn't
