2006-09-12T15:12:00.000Z	guerby		hi, I recently moved one of my PC from SuSE 9.3 to Ubuntu 6.06, and from time to time evolution show an error popup when I send email mentionning "X-Evolution-Fcc: file:///home/guerby/evolution/local/Sent", folder which does not exist, any idea of where it could come from?
2006-09-12T15:13:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	that sounds like Exalution is configucred to save sent emails in a Sent folhder
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	does that diretory exist?
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	is your user account in that same directory in current setup?
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	the dir does not exist, and I could not find in the option where "local" save is activated
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	I see...
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	my user HOME is /home/guerby
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	?did you copy evalution config directory from your old install?
2006-09-12T15:14:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	evolution stuff is in .evolution/...
2006-09-12T15:15:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	yes I copied the config, but there was no guerby/evolution in the old setup and no popup ever showed up
2006-09-12T15:15:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	(from your suse 9.3 install)
2006-09-12T15:15:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	I tried grepping but without success
2006-09-12T15:15:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	and it does not do so for all emails so I'm a bit lost
2006-09-12T15:15:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	hrrm not sure what to say.. .ut I expect taht something probelematic has come across from old suse install
2006-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	sorry, you need to ask  evolution-experts ;-)
2006-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	or user Thunderbird instead ;-)
2006-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	any idea of where the evo experts are hiding?
2006-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	no, I dont use evolution
2006-09-12T15:16:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	ok thanks for your time!
2006-09-12T15:19:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	oh I found some accounts other than my main that have HOME/evolution in their options
2006-09-12T15:20:00.000Z	enyc	guerby	hrrm.... $HOME you mean?
2006-09-12T15:20:00.000Z	guerby	enyc	yep, I'm fixing all that stuff
