2007-10-28T20:12:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	I wouldn't put the Friction of the Wobbly Windows very low... its not good :p
2007-10-28T20:13:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	no but how can  I use wobbly without having windows sticking to borders of the screen ? I hate that
2007-10-28T20:16:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	Did you try to disable Snap inverted?
2007-10-28T20:16:00.000Z	Utimer		(had to look it up)
2007-10-28T20:17:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	where is this ?
2007-10-28T20:17:00.000Z	Utimer		in the ccsm
2007-10-28T20:17:00.000Z	Utimer		!ccsm
2007-10-28T20:18:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	its the first checkbox in the wobbly windows settings panel in ccsm

2007-10-28T20:19:00.000Z	Utimer		Damn you ubot3!
2007-10-28T20:19:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	thank you !!!
2007-10-28T20:20:00.000Z	Utimer		sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-10-28T20:20:00.000Z	Utimer		that will install if for you
2007-10-28T20:20:00.000Z	Utimer		(just throw that in a console)
2007-10-28T20:21:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	problem is that I can't use border resitance. because snaping windows can't be enabled along wobly
2007-10-28T20:21:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	yes correct
2007-10-28T20:21:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	I would like to just keep border resistance, but not the adherance
2007-10-28T20:21:00.000Z	Utimer		I have no idea how you could get that to work
2007-10-28T20:22:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	it's still a mess, like most of the time in Linux. They packed a lot of functions, but the integration is lacking a bit
2007-10-28T20:22:00.000Z	mirak	Utimer	sometime having things to much configurable doens't help to make them usable easily
2007-10-28T20:22:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	Well mostly it works fine, but those 2 just don't like each other a whole lot :)
2007-10-28T20:23:00.000Z	Utimer	mirak	not to mention I disabled the effect after 2 days as it become annoying ;)
