2009-05-04T04:22:00.000Z	gent_first		hello
2009-05-04T04:23:00.000Z	gent_first		i have ubuntu installed on another parition but i dont have mIRC on it
2009-05-04T04:23:00.000Z	gent_first		does mIRC work with ubuntu
2009-05-04T04:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 it might work with wine... but theres other irc clients id suggest.
2009-05-04T04:24:00.000Z	gent_first	Dr_Willis	sure, i just want it to be free/open source etc. like mIRC
2009-05-04T04:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 err.. mIRC is not Free/opensourced..  most people use 'xchat'  not 'xchat-gnome'  so try them out
2009-05-04T04:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 never paying for it does NOT make it 'free/opensourced'
2009-05-04T04:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 as for secure.. well.. i recall many bugs with it in the past.
2009-05-04T04:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 try out other irc clients.. see what you like.
2009-05-04T04:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 err... for the last time. mIRC is not 'free/OSS'
2009-05-04T04:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 I tend to use xchat in linux and windows.
2009-05-04T04:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 lately i been using irssi and 'znc'
2009-05-04T04:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 there is no 'mIRC' for linux. ther eare IRC clients...
2009-05-04T04:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 theres numerous  linux irc clients with scripting features.. it depends on your needs.
2009-05-04T04:31:00.000Z	gent_first	Dr_Willis	404
2009-05-04T04:32:00.000Z	gent_first	Dr_Willis	gimme link plz. working
2009-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 google.com perhaps?
2009-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	gent_first	Dr_Willis	ok i told u i searched google. their are many clients for linux IRC but nothing like mIRC and certainly no installation files.
2009-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 its time you learned some ubuntu/linux basics..  start with the 'ubuntu package manager' docs.
2009-05-04T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 you do NOT NOT NOT normally go to  web sites and download 'installer files' for ubuntu apps.
2009-05-04T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 its in the package manager under 'irssi' read the irssi.org docs also to learn to use it.
2009-05-04T04:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 use the package manger tool
2009-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 run 'synaptic' from the menus.. serach for irssi, install it.. or use the command line given a dozen times so far..
2009-05-04T04:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gent_first	 there are other irc clients.. go test them out.. or run mIRC in wine if you must hafve mIRC
