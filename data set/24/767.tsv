2011-03-09T21:00:00.000Z	terry	pcypher	How are youpolling for interface statistics?
2011-03-09T21:00:00.000Z	pcypher		snmp
2011-03-09T21:00:00.000Z	pcypher		and I can walk

2011-03-09T21:03:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	snmp and spine
2011-03-09T21:03:00.000Z	terry	pcypher	Ive yet to use snmp, am installing it now.
2011-03-09T21:03:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	wow... thanks
2011-03-09T21:05:00.000Z	terry	pcypher	So what is the exact command  you used to produce the output you sent us?
2011-03-09T21:06:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	hrmmm... not exactly sure... it looks like cacti is just doing an snmpwalk with values gathered rfom an xml... im just starting to learn this so I am not sure.
2011-03-09T21:07:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	so pretty much, I can snmpwalk from this host to the other from terminal, and cacti can poll for data using snmp and does not error...
2011-03-09T21:07:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	you you are leaning toward a bad value from where its calling the walk
2011-03-09T21:07:00.000Z	pcypher		hmmm
2011-03-09T21:12:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	i dont know... im looking at the xml but cannot make heads or tails of it
2011-03-09T21:13:00.000Z	pcypher	terry	im going to try for local host.
