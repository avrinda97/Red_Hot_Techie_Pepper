2008-11-23T05:05:00.000Z	Happy		hi. howto turn off flash? as it slow down my ubuntu. i used to rename .mozilla/plugin--off now this folder does not exit
2008-11-23T05:06:00.000Z	Happy		i find this 8.04.2 so different. it made me hard
2008-11-23T05:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	When it comes to flash, I prefer using the purge command, but that's just me.
2008-11-23T05:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	and why would you need to rename it in the first place?
2008-11-23T05:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	In the location bar, type about:config. Search for "plugins" in the filter and you should see one that says "expose full path." Double click that to set it to true
2008-11-23T05:18:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	not found: expose full path ?
2008-11-23T05:18:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	about:config -> plugins
2008-11-23T05:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	plugin.expose_full_path
2008-11-23T05:20:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	it is false, set to true ? what will happen if true ?
2008-11-23T05:21:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	When you set it to true, and go back into about:plugins it will show you exactly where the installed copy of flash is sitting.
2008-11-23T05:21:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	ok
2008-11-23T05:22:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	ok set to true, now what ?
2008-11-23T05:22:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	what's next step ?
2008-11-23T05:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	You mentioned flash is still installed and you want to get rid of it, yes?
2008-11-23T05:23:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	try to turn off, if not, try to get rid of it -- the d thing
2008-11-23T05:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	Okay, yeah, go into about:plugins now, and tell us where that copy of flash (libflashplayer.so) is sitting.
2008-11-23T05:25:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	File name: /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so
2008-11-23T05:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	That's from the official package. If you're having trouble getting rid of it via the terminal, go into Synaptic and search for it.
2008-11-23T05:28:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	seems gone now :D
2008-11-23T05:28:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	FF by default installed lots of other plugin: most of them video player. should i remove them as well ?
2008-11-23T05:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	A lot of those plugins are components of other packages. I wouldn't bother hunting them all down unless they're causing problems.
2008-11-23T05:29:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	ok
2008-11-23T05:30:00.000Z	Happy	bobertdos	thanks :)
2008-11-23T05:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	Happy	no problem
