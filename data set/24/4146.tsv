2007-06-27T10:29:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser		Is it recommended to use Swat for Samba?
2007-06-27T10:30:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser		Or what are your guys's expericces with it
2007-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser		tritium I'm just trying to setup a simple share to setup the computer running ubuntu server as aserver...you suggest running swat then?
2007-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser		For backup, maybe users IDK yet
2007-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 you may want to install the 'samba-doc' package and read the 2 included using samba books.
2007-06-30T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 you did install the samba package? you did give the users samba passwords with 'sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAMES' you did ENABLE the home shares by editing the samba config?
2007-06-30T10:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 for the share names give the users name for the last bit. not 'homes' also.
2007-06-30T10:10:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	I'm sorry? What do you mean?
2007-06-30T10:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 instead of //whatever/home  use //whatever/bubba (or whatever the username is) or are younot using the 'home dir' shares?
2007-06-30T10:11:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	no sir....http://pastebin.com/939368
2007-06-30T10:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	  ive notied that the things gets a bit confused when you try to access the 'home' share the first time..  once ya use the user name, it reizes you want a users home dir share instead.
2007-06-30T10:14:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	well ultimately I want each user to have his or her own folder (in the mount /srv/user1 /srv/user2) and access to a public share (/srv/public) and so far /srv/public is kind of working, what do you suggest?
2007-06-30T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 there are 2 Samba Books included in the 'samba-doc' package.. If you want to get your samba skills up - they are WELL WELL worth reading.
2007-06-30T10:17:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	great will follow up on those, where are they? And is it possible to help me fix this little problem? http://pastebin.com/939368 IDK i followed the guide perfectly. .... :(
2007-06-30T10:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 i just sent a update to that pastebin. showing my Public samba share.
2007-06-30T10:22:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	I'm new to patebin, how do I view the differences?
2007-06-30T10:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 heck - the site keeps timing out on me when i update it...  May want to try some different pastebin place in the futyre. :()
2007-06-30T10:23:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	ok hold on
2007-06-30T10:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	http://pastebin.com/939368
2007-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 its possibl theres some windows firewall going on.
2007-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 windows can be a pain at times.    sadly. Those using samba books (in samba-doc) give trouble shooting tips
2007-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	good point, but I have disabled all that crap, I'm running DD-WRT on my linux box
2007-06-30T10:33:00.000Z	UbuntuServerUser	dr_willis	btw wher can I find those?
2007-06-30T10:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	UbuntuServerUser	 they are in the 'samba-doc' package in the repos
