2009-08-11T21:23:00.000Z	xiong		are there corruption issues with gftp?
2009-08-11T21:24:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 did you google that  ...let me look
2009-08-11T21:24:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	i don't see anything
2009-08-11T21:24:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 no  I dont either
2009-08-11T21:25:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	will you try this? http://eaglehouse.us/resume/ -- download the PDF
2009-08-11T21:25:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	i uploaded that PDF to the site myself using gftp, is why
2009-08-11T21:25:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 there is a format error here  but it did download
2009-08-11T21:26:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	the PDF was okay before i uploaded it -- i'm trying to figure out what's going wrong
2009-08-11T21:27:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 oh I understand now... I was thinking you had compile errors with the gftp source
2009-08-11T21:28:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 did you create that pdf on linux or windows?
2009-08-11T21:28:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	i just want to know why the download is corrupt -- besides you and i, there is one other user reported the issue -- as i compare the local and remote file, the byte count is correct -- i created the pdf on a mac os 9 machine
2009-08-11T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 you can upload the pdf  to speedyshare.com  let me test the original file
2009-08-11T21:30:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	the local file is readable on my linux box -- and previous to today, i had uploaded the pdf to a site and had good downloads of it -- i'm thinking some sort of corruption involving linefeed translation???
2009-08-11T21:30:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	will do
2009-08-11T21:30:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	  I would go to #linux  channel and  see if someone there has more info about this
2009-08-11T21:31:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	http://www.speedyshare.com/639570432.html
2009-08-11T21:31:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 this file is fine
2009-08-11T21:32:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	you downloaded okay from speedyshare? -- if so, then i wonder if it is time to complain to my server hosting company
2009-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 yes I downloaded the one from speedyshare and it was fine      I think a complaint is in order
2009-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	thank you for your help
2009-08-11T21:33:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	 no problem   let me know if you get this sorted out and what the issue was :)
2010-08-28T05:16:00.000Z	coz_	xiong	  off hand I dont know  but  if no one else knows you could try the ##linux channel
2010-08-28T05:17:00.000Z	xiong	coz_	Gonna talk there, too. I find the guys here on #ubuntu are very sharp and helpful.
