2010-02-25T10:59:00.000Z	Hellhound666		have a java question when somebody gets a chance. thanks
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Hellhound666	What sort of java question?
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I'll just post it "exec: 48: java: not found"
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Hellhound666	Flannel	exec: 48: java: not found
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Hellhound666	Have you installed java?
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I've installed jre too
2010-02-25T11:00:00.000Z	Hellhound666		yup both pms-linux PS3 server won't launch and vuze
2010-02-25T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Hellhound666	install sun-java6-bin (-jre itself won't do it)
2010-02-25T11:01:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I did some searching and maybe a conflict with compiz + java
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I'll give it a shot I installed the binary but I'll try again
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Hellhound666		wait jdk right?
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Hellhound666		so sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin ?
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Hellhound666	yes
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel		!java | Hellhound666
2010-02-25T11:02:00.000Z	Hellhound666		ok I'll give it a shot hopefully it's that easy
2010-02-25T11:03:00.000Z	Hellhound666		oh I feel dump lol

2010-02-25T11:05:00.000Z	Hellhound666		gtk+ but I need a bunch of dependencies right?
2010-02-25T11:05:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I'm not up to speed with that
2010-02-25T11:06:00.000Z	Hellhound666		I'm running triple boot right now ha
