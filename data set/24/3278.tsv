2010-04-09T04:58:00.000Z	rahduke		does anyone wanna help me or what? I've been in this room at least 20 times looking for help with the same problem and people just ignore me. I'm really getting fed up!!!
2010-04-09T04:58:00.000Z	rahduke		im not asking some question that is rocket science im sure someone here knows the answer
2010-04-09T04:58:00.000Z	rahduke		its total nonsense
2010-04-09T04:59:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	people aren't ignoring you- maybe nobody knows the answer?
2010-04-09T05:00:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	that doesnt make sense to u ?
2010-04-09T05:00:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	I'm using the sidekick animation in compiz for minimization, for watever reason sometimes the animation looks as if its minimizing to my panel instead of my dock, its a ticky tack thing but its really effing annoying
2010-04-09T05:01:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	sorry but i have a big problem myself with something more important to me
2010-04-09T05:01:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	ill fix ur problem, what is it?
2010-04-09T05:02:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	im trying to make a .deb installer to install my toolkit onto the comp of whoever wants to have my toolkit. but i cant get the .deb to do anything. it syas its installed but doesnt do anything
2010-04-09T05:02:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	what kind of toolkit?
2010-04-09T05:03:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	just a mixture of different scripts and apps i have made. currently just contains my backup and restoring system
2010-04-09T05:03:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	how are you creating the .deb?
2010-04-09T05:04:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	with dpkg - can you help me?
2010-04-09T05:05:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	sounds right to me....
2010-04-09T05:05:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	since i dont know what your packaging its tough to determine if i could help
2010-04-09T05:05:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	do i NEED to specify postinst & prerm SCRIPTS to install my package, because i still can't run it after installing
2010-04-09T05:06:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	if your packaging scripts you do
2010-04-09T05:06:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	where will the .deb install the contents of it to ?
2010-04-09T05:07:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	it depends on the paramaters, i've never deb packaged scripts, i don't know why you would
2010-04-09T05:07:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	why not just tar the files and scripts you want to include and then put them whereever u want
2010-04-09T05:07:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	how would you suggest i package my toolkit then?
2010-04-09T05:07:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	yeah..
2010-04-09T05:08:00.000Z	darksider	rahduke	okay. thanks
2010-04-09T05:08:00.000Z	rahduke	darksider	the only way i know to deb packages installs the bins to usr/bin or usr/share/
