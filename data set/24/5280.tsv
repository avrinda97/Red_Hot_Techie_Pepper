2006-08-28T10:25:00.000Z	npster	Abstract	Sorry, you can't create ext3 formated partitions in Windows, but you can create any other Windows File System, such as FAT or NTFS.
2006-08-28T10:26:00.000Z	Abstract	npster	Sorry, I misunderstood
2006-08-28T10:26:00.000Z	Abstract	npster	I mean blank space in windows

2006-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	npster	Abstract	Yes, now I understand but your HDD ( I hope has a blank space) so you just have to make the partition in Ubuntu from the Balnk space.
2006-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	Abstract		It has a 7mb blank space
2006-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	Abstract		I need to resize
