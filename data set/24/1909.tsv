2009-07-13T00:42:00.000Z	UTZXUBIRU		i have a 30gb swap partiton because i thought i could use the extra space... now i d like to reduce it how large should it be?
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	dunks	UTZXUBIRU	about the size of your ram :p
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	dunks		or twice as much
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	UTZXUBIRU		hehe
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	dunks		So 30Gb is a bit much :D
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	dunks	UTZXUBIRU	2Gb would be about right
2009-07-13T00:43:00.000Z	UTZXUBIRU		i have 3gb ram
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	UTZXUBIRU		should i use 3 or 6gb
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	dunks		2-3Gb
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	UTZXUBIRU		ok ill go with 3
2009-07-13T00:44:00.000Z	dunks	UTZXUBIRU	you'll only use swap if you go over 3Gb of RAM usage,
