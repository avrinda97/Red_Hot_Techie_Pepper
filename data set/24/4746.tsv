2008-12-12T07:14:00.000Z	qcjn		does ssh changes port or what ?
2008-12-12T07:15:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	You should actually run ssh daemon on an aobscure port to prevent automated login attempts to port 22
2008-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	good idea i ll look into that after
2008-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	so i'd have to make user@adress -p
2008-12-12T07:21:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	Yes -p 12345   for instance
2008-12-12T07:22:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	hw do you change that, and it must be on the server side ?
2008-12-12T07:23:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	i havec openssh on my both machines ! can that cause problems ?
2008-12-12T07:23:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	It's on the server side, yes. In the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2008-12-12T07:24:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	No, you can run the daemon on both boxes, it doesn't matter
2008-12-12T07:25:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	i typed sudo, and it took about 30 seconds before it appeared
2008-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	How do you mean? You just typed: sudo                                               and nothing else?
2008-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	i'm connected with ssh, but it's to slow
2008-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	If you have a slow connection and typing lag is very bad, you can specify ssh to use compression with -C
2008-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	It helps a bit
2008-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	here s my connection 3.22megabits per second/392.55kilobytes per second, it ain't bad
2008-12-12T07:30:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	Yes, but your connection to your server is only as fast as the slowest machine which is in the middle
2008-12-12T07:34:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	how can i know
2008-12-12T07:35:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	"ping" is a useful tool. Also tracepath
2009-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	thanks
2009-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	Qt is for KDE, GTK is for regular Ubuntu (GNOME)
2009-05-25T08:32:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	You're welcome.
2009-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	can i install (or must i) for when i m under kde, and when i m under gnome ??
2009-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	genii	qcjn	It does not matter from which you install.
2009-05-25T08:34:00.000Z	qcjn	genii	ok
