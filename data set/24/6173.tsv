2005-12-30T17:41:00.000Z	Hobbsee	hypernewbie	most people here use grub, so they are better at troubleshooting it - and it's a lot easier to kill your system with wrong lilo commands than wrong grub commands, i hear
2005-12-30T17:41:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	probably. i'm out of knowledge for this one
2005-12-30T17:43:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	he doesnt have live cd

2005-12-30T17:44:00.000Z	Hobbsee	hypernewbie	for a screwed bootloader?  no, i'd try reinstalling the bootloader first!
2005-12-30T17:44:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	i hate bootloaders.

2005-12-30T17:45:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	leme check that, my knowledge of grub is negative
2005-12-30T17:45:00.000Z	Hobbsee	hypernewbie	top post, uses the standard installer to reinstall grub :P
2005-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	have u tried installing knoppix before?
2005-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	i tried once and i got a nice grub load fail error 15...
2005-12-30T17:46:00.000Z	Hobbsee	hypernewbie	no, and i've had an error 15 before
2005-12-30T17:47:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	wth is a grub error15?
2005-12-30T17:47:00.000Z	Hobbsee	hypernewbie	well, grub screwed up with one of the dapper updates, so i had to edit it manually, after getting an error 15
2005-12-30T17:50:00.000Z	hypernewbie	Hobbsee	hmm...
