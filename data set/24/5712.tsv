2007-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Did you install all the restricted codecs?
2007-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	I installed the ugly and bad as well as w32codecs
2007-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Check the restricted codecs page to make sure.
2007-04-20T13:32:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	I can't find this package "totem-xine-firefox-plugin" and I'm in Feisty
2007-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Is it listed on packages.ubuntu.com?
2007-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	no, it's not there, but it's listed in the Support Documentation that comes with Feisty :(
2007-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	did you install the "ubuntu restricted extras" package?
2007-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	which package is that ?
2007-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Its on that page I sent to you.
2007-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Look here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
2007-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	yeah, I've been there, it's not working for me :(
2007-04-20T13:38:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Read it again, try this link to jump right to the relevant part: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-053cb0af417294c03fea17f80b4e9f26924619f0-2
2007-04-20T13:38:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	I've installed the gstreamer bad and ugly stuff, the ffmpeg stuff, the w32codecs, libdvdcss, and mozilla-mplayer and I get no streaming video, flash video I get, but no other video
2007-04-20T13:39:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	It tells you how to install "Ubuntu Restricted Extras" on that link I sent you. You need to try that next.
2007-04-20T13:40:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	oh, I think I missed that line...sorry, it's really late here, errr...early....duh, need coffee
2007-04-20T13:44:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	ok, so that package is installed but I'm still having the same problem. Like, Apple Trailers just has a black screen
2007-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	ok, so that package is installed but I'm still having the same problem. Like, Apple Trailers just has a black screen
2007-04-20T13:49:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Try a bunch of different video files, if some play and others don't its most likely a codec issue. I can't really offer any more help than that.
2007-04-20T13:49:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	the video files play, on my computer, but I can't get any videos to play in my browser
2007-04-20T13:49:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	that's what's weird
2007-04-20T13:50:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Hang on.
2007-04-20T13:52:00.000Z	ajax4	tristanmike	Sorry man, pretty much out of ideas on your problem.
2007-04-20T13:53:00.000Z	tristanmike	ajax4	I always appreciate the help, thank you :D
