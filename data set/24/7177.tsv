2005-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	How would I install grub into an empty partition?
2005-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	grub-install /dev/your_partition
2005-12-10T07:48:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	that puts all the init-rds, kernels, and config stuff in it?
2005-12-10T07:48:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	no, it installs grub
2005-12-10T07:50:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	ok..well what happened was I was running debian on this machine and edited the menu by hand...i just want the automagic kernel list working for ubuntu and not debian
2005-12-10T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	relax, just a netsplit
2005-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	this one is a good start
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	I've asked here a few times. Got a mobo that only boots CDs if there are no HDDs present (proper boot order)
2005-12-10T10:36:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	that really sounds like an incorrect boot order in the bios
2005-12-10T10:36:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	i want as far as rmoving all but cdrom from the boot order. still boots HDDs
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	saik0	Seveas	know anyplace somebody might be able to help with that mobo problem?
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Seveas	saik0	not really
