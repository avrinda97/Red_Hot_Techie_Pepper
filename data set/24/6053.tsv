2006-06-14T14:12:00.000Z	webmind		does anyone know if it's possible to connect a run action to data cd's ?
2006-06-14T14:12:00.000Z	webmind		or cd's in general ?
2006-06-14T14:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	well when you insert an ubuntu cd, the update manager opens, so my guess is yes
2006-06-14T14:22:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	isn't this more like an autorun function, which also needs to have something on the cd ?
2006-06-14T14:22:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	I'd simply like to be able to run qemu on cd's
2006-06-14T14:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	you mean you want to be able to run executables off a mounted cd? - that's easy, you just need the right file permissions
2006-06-14T14:30:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	no
2006-06-14T14:30:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	I want to be able to use the cd as a device for qemu (qemu -cdrom /dev/hdc or something)
2006-06-14T14:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	yep, that's no problem
2006-06-14T14:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	as long as you're not trying to write to it...
2006-06-14T14:45:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	well I generally don't write to cd's.. but I would I go about doing this ?
2006-06-14T14:45:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	what I want is to be able to right click the cd and say run this
2006-06-14T14:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	yes you can run executables from a cd - whether under linux or through qemu - I don't see any problem
2006-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	I don't want to run anything -from- the cd, I want to run the cd (as a bootable device with some VM softwre)
2006-06-14T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	I think I understand - you want to have a VM running, eg qemu, drop in say a live cd, & have the live cd boot? I think that should work
2006-06-14T15:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	all you should need is the 'boot -d' option - to boot off the cd
2006-06-14T15:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	boot -c /dev/cdrom
2006-06-14T15:08:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	yes.. I can do it from the commandline.. no problem.. but I wonder if I can set it as a menu option, when I right click the CD
2006-06-14T15:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	sure, create a menu entry to that effect, or just put a link on the desktop
2006-06-14T15:10:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	link on the desktop would no apear in the 'right click cd menu' and I don't know how to add items to that menu
2006-06-14T15:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	well it's doable - maybe google
2006-06-14T15:12:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	any sugestion for search terms? because  I've got no idea where to look
2006-06-14T15:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	webmind	you should have no problem doing this through Apps -> Accessories -> Alacarte Menu Editor -> File -> New Entry
2006-06-14T15:27:00.000Z	webmind	Frogzoo	thanks, except I don't have the 'file' in there ?
