2008-05-15T09:14:00.000Z	Shpook		Or, better yet, what would be the best way to extract information off of a bad hd? It's in a laptop, and I've tried BackTrack with no success, and booting from an external drive. Everything tries to access the internal HDD and freezes the boot up.
2008-05-15T09:15:00.000Z	NastyAccident	Shpook	live cd it. :-)
2008-05-15T09:16:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	That's what I've been trying to do, but livecd is trying to access the hard drive.
2008-05-15T09:16:00.000Z	NastyAccident	Shpook	what is your boot order?
2008-05-15T09:16:00.000Z	NastyAccident		CDROM, HD1, HD2?
2008-05-15T09:17:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Make sure it is booting into the CDROM before HDs!
2008-05-15T09:17:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Change it in the bios.
2008-05-15T09:17:00.000Z	Shpook		Not sure, I believe it's usb-hdd, cd-rom, hdd1, pxe
2008-05-15T09:18:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	Sorry, I think it's usb-hd, cd-rom, hd, pxe
2008-05-15T09:18:00.000Z	NastyAccident		boot cdrom first.
2008-05-15T09:20:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	Will boot order affect LiveCD? I just looked and it boots the hd before cd. I've been over-riding the boot order each boot.
2008-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	NastyAccident	Shpook	it tries to boot the external drive.
2008-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Just switch it to the CDROM and you'll be able to get into the LiveCD.
2008-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Easy data transfer.
2008-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	Right, I have it set like that purposely. Each boot I have the option to override the boot order, and I select cd. I choose the option to enter LiveCD, and when it tries loading LiveCD, it tries to access the HD.
2008-05-15T09:23:00.000Z	NastyAccident		What LiveCD are you using?
2008-05-15T09:24:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	I tried both Ubuntu Hardy normal install and BackTrack
2008-05-15T09:25:00.000Z	NastyAccident	Shpook	the default action of a LiveCD should be to write to the memory.
2008-05-15T09:25:00.000Z	NastyAccident		I'm not sure why you're crashing on a boot, if you have it set up to read the cdrom drive first.
2008-05-15T09:26:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	Okay, I wasn't sure. I think this laptop is cursed. :-)
2008-05-15T09:26:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Perhaps, try a different LiveCD?
2008-05-15T09:27:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	lol I'm on 4 different downloads and 6 different burns, all with md5 verified. Unless you mean a different distro.
2008-05-15T09:27:00.000Z	NastyAccident		Try KillBill. >.>
2008-05-15T09:30:00.000Z	Shpook	NastyAccident	So, I just took the hd out of the laptop, and it booted right up into livecd.
