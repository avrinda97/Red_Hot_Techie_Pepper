2010-03-22T16:50:00.000Z	happyface		are there any irssi themes that color nick names so rooms look more organized
2010-03-22T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 the irssi homepage has tons of themes/scripts for that
2010-03-22T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 weechat can also do that feature.
2010-03-22T16:58:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	I've tried themes but all just make the text all one color really
2010-03-22T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 its not a theme thing. its a script thing
2010-03-22T17:01:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	thanks
2010-06-04T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 i copy extra fonts to my users /home/username/.fonts dir all the time.
2010-06-04T18:04:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	huh?
2010-06-04T18:04:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	I think your talking to the wrong person
2010-06-04T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 you could edit the /etc/default/grub to set the proper default. or the /etc/grub.d/config
2010-06-04T18:05:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	thanks I'll try that
2010-06-04T18:05:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	which one is propor to edit though?
2010-06-04T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 no idea. Check the grub docs.  its listed in one of those.
2010-07-12T19:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 yes. It has worked.. but i am sure to always have windows 'unmount' any of the linux filesystems when i dont need them.
2010-07-12T19:23:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	thanks, do you know if it can format drives to ext2 aswell?
2010-07-12T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 no idea.
2010-07-18T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 thats a setting of the channel.   nothing on your end.
2010-07-18T21:42:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	ok cool, so what channel setting is that (so I understand it)?
2010-07-18T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 if theres an 'attack' they can set Unreg'ed users to go to that channel instead of here.
2010-07-18T21:43:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	makes sense, thank you
2010-07-19T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 you have to use the 'offset' feature of mount i recall.
2010-07-19T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 i saw a guide on it once...
2010-07-19T01:08:00.000Z	happyface	Dr_Willis	ah that's what I was thinking... I wonder how to find that
2010-07-19T01:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	happyface	 fdisk -l on the file i recall.. and then  figure otu the #'s from there
