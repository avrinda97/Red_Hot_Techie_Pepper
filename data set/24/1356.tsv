2010-02-20T10:13:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		I want to install ubuntu to take up my entire drive, however i want to import the data from my current ubuntu installation (which is corrupt in the boot) yet ubuntu's installer wont let me. is there a workaround for this?
2010-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		sorry, i was typing fast pepee. it means the /boot/ directory is GONE
2010-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		even "grub-install"
2010-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		the boot directory is completely corrupt, i cant repair this no matter what
2010-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		but i've 15 gigs that i want to keep, yet reinstall ubuntu
2010-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		i wish i could just get this damn vmlinuz. and linux-image, thing working
2010-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Have you tried this tut: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351  <<< it worked for me many times
2010-02-20T10:20:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 When you boot does GRUB load?
2010-02-20T10:21:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Can't you mount the partition from Debian and copy the files from there?
2010-02-20T10:25:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 I asked you if you can mount it from within Debian and axx the files that way.
2010-02-20T10:36:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Why can't you partition it?
2010-02-20T10:26:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Don't you have any external storage devices?
2010-02-20T10:29:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Please lol. I am confused.
2010-02-20T10:36:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Is that Gparted on the ubuntu Live CD?
2010-02-20T10:37:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 I don't think there's a difference, both do same thing.
2010-02-20T10:38:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Is that Gparted on the ubuntu Live CD?
2010-02-20T10:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 You should try another partition program like cfdisk, or a Windows solution.
2010-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	NewWorld	i dont have windows on this system at all
2010-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 It could be that your hardrive is physically impaired. I had that and it was horrible.. you should run a surface test to see if it is physically defected.
2010-02-20T10:40:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	NewWorld	its not my hard drive, i deleted the directory once by accident.
2010-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Talk about it, I resized my parititon yesterday, corrupted.. lost so much stuff :'(
2010-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Can't. Get external storage or free up space on the Debian partition.
2010-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 Use different partitioning tools.
2010-02-20T10:47:00.000Z	NewWorld	CkhiKuzad	 You don't need windows, these programs are booted into. Check 'Hiren's BootCD' for example.
