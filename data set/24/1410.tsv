2010-08-25T21:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	uh not quite sure what your after, but  wget is a fun  and useful way to download stuff using the terminal,  also the Firefox download manager is quite nice really :)
2010-08-25T21:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	not with FIrefox it isn't
2010-08-25T21:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	I woudn't normally recommend Opera, but I have a feeling it may have the kind of thing that your after, with it
2010-08-25T21:51:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	i don't know but it sometimes does't resume ..
2010-08-25T21:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	What are you downloading anyway?
2010-08-25T21:53:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	draper iso image .. needed for testing urgently .. in firefox i got 14kBps in IDM (in virtual xp) i'm downloading ate 98KBps .. bug difference
2010-08-25T21:53:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	now 220KBps
2010-08-25T21:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	draper?  you mean Ubuntu Dapper Drake?
2010-08-25T21:53:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	ya
2010-08-25T21:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	yeah there probably isn't a torrent for such old releases anymore
2010-08-25T21:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	if there was though, well  I guess thats the way for you to download it
2010-08-25T21:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	and you need 6.06 for testing urgently?? why?
2010-08-25T21:55:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	security issue .. its LTS
2010-08-25T21:55:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	but, i want to download it in ubuntu next time .. so i though if i can get an equivalent
2010-08-25T21:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	on the server it will be supported still  just about
2010-08-25T21:56:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	ya, i work for the security team, need to fix an issue in it..
2010-08-25T21:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	ah ok that explains it
2010-08-25T21:58:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	i guess, if you can voice my issue here ... about a downloader like IDM .. you may be more familiar with people here
2010-08-25T21:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	I have used download manager programs in Windows before or at least one,  in  Linux distros they seem quite useless
2010-08-25T21:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	and maybe you can Wine something
2010-08-25T21:59:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	i think if it does not exist in ubuntu .. we should search something that we can port in ubuntu .. this is a big loophole
2010-08-25T22:00:00.000Z	simar	sebsebseb	wine ... better option must exist
2010-08-25T22:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	simar	uhmm Windows virtual machine?
