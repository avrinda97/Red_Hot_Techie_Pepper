2011-12-29T13:29:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	i dont know how to put them, ive tryed to boot with this command install fp=false but it says install kernel was not found
2011-12-29T13:33:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	please help me lol i am desperat to get ubuntu running,
2011-12-29T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	atvr	use the boot option:  nomodeset   or:  radeon.nomodeset=1    the link ubottu gave shows the method
2011-12-29T13:35:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	okay thanks you :)
2011-12-29T13:42:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	ive chek the site that youve seed me, but that is not the same version i am trying to install so its not the same setup
2011-12-29T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	atvr	it's the same boot loader, so the method is identical
2011-12-29T13:44:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	jizz i just dont understand can you please explan me how to do it, i am new to this and this is very frustating me
2011-12-29T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	atvr	hold SHIFT at boot and you should get the old boot screen
2012-01-04T11:35:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	i think SVNDR issue, wouldnt be a bios issue, because like he said that windows was working fine whit no extreme heat, so the issu might be with ubuntu itself
2012-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	atvr	maybe the linux kernel needs the update
2012-01-04T11:37:00.000Z	atvr	ActionParsnip	maybe i am new to ubuntu/linux, i was just saying that, it make sens to me that its not a bios issue
2012-01-04T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	atvr	there may be an ACPI fix which may not show its head so much in Windows but may help Linux greatly
