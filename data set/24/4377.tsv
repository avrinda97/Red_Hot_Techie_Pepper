2007-11-14T20:51:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	yeh, except the libpam-keyring package is not available in gutsy... (well, it's listed, but it's a virtual package and doesn't actualy install anything)
2007-11-14T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	why don't you read the whole thing first?
2007-11-14T20:52:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	i did... it says that it is integrated into gutsy, but it's not working
2007-11-14T20:53:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	then file a bug report
2007-11-14T20:53:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	yes?
2007-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	there have already been bug reports filed, and no solutions
2007-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	then i guess you're sol
2007-11-14T20:57:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	is this the bug report you were referring to: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/16356
2007-11-14T20:58:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	one of them, yes... but "common-pamkeyring" is not available in gutsy. this was a pam include file that came with libpam-keyring
2007-11-14T21:00:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	it doesn't say anything about requiring common-pamkeyring, that i can see. i assume the solution that is given in the forum thread linked to in the bug report didn't work?
2007-11-14T21:00:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	yes
2007-11-14T21:02:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	and you've removed libpam-keyring?
2007-11-14T21:02:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	removed it?
2007-11-14T21:02:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	it is no longer required, and is in fact probably causing your difficulties
2007-11-14T21:03:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	it's a virtual package and doesn't actually install anything
2007-11-14T21:03:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	i would recommend trying a fresh install; i suspect your problem will vanish
2007-11-14T21:03:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	it is a fresh install
2007-11-14T21:04:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	and you don't get the check box to automatically unlock your keyring?
2007-11-14T21:04:00.000Z	jerbear	sipior	no
2007-11-14T21:04:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	then you best file another bug report
2009-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	nil, i suspect.
2009-06-30T20:56:00.000Z	sipior	jerbear	officially, of course. i'm sure it will be available in other repositories soon.
