2011-12-12T10:26:00.000Z	MahaVishnu		trying to use an nvidia gefore 430 gt w/ an integrated intel 915. can someone help me set this up? right now I only see the monitor connected via vga from the 915 and no X. im sure I need so edit Xorg but not sure what to do.
2011-12-12T10:27:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	This is likely far beyond my ability, but I'll give it a shot as it seems pretty quiet at the moment.  What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2011-12-12T10:28:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	11.10
2011-12-12T10:29:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	Ok.  And you can't get X to start at all?
2011-12-12T10:30:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	nah it just goes back to the tty7 right now hold on ill paste my xorg.
2011-12-12T10:32:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	I'm using an NVidia card now, but I've never tried to use dual cards, and definitely not with an intel integrated card.  You want an extended screen, not a separate x-session on each, right?
2011-12-12T10:33:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	hold on a minute im finishing it up.

2011-12-12T10:39:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	767596 sorry
2011-12-12T10:42:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	Ok, I've actually seen a forum post with someone trying to do exactly what you're asking, and when I read it there was no successful conclusion, but I'll bet it is possible with a little jimmying
2011-12-12T10:43:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	Ahhhh, ok then.  this is getting more and more interesting...
2011-12-12T10:44:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	how so? the audio part is really unrelated matter.
2011-12-12T10:45:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	Well, the first step is really getting it to work at all, right? Then we would need to get a separate X server running on each card, or really on just the NVidia, right
2011-12-12T10:46:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	I really don't know. from what i've seen my xorg should work I thought. we need an expert.
2011-12-12T10:47:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	Well..this isn't exactly expert, but I did catch some spelling errors
2011-12-12T10:47:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	me too fixed em. such a small screen here. looking at it on my laptop now
2011-12-12T10:48:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	you fixed, EmdSubSection, and the missing quotes on line 71?
2011-12-12T10:50:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	yea still doesn't work
2011-12-12T10:51:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	I am usually pretty good at X but like you said this is complicated and I don't know for certain if it's possible.
2011-12-12T10:53:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	well, I'm not sure about getting X to run on only one card, but even if you cant, you can always run a single X session across both and then put a term on the laptop, right?  Or does that not work either?  And is there anything enlightening in the Xorg log?
2011-12-12T11:46:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	MahaVishnu	!!!!! Pleaze post a tutorial somewhere!
2011-12-12T11:48:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	yea I got it working, want to see my  Xorg ?
2011-12-12T11:49:00.000Z	MahaVishnu	JokesOnYou77	hold on brb switching to xchat.
