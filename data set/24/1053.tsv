2010-10-24T21:45:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Why would your gateway block SOME addresses?
2010-10-24T21:47:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Where are you trying to download the keys from?
2010-10-24T21:48:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Is this the first time trying? Did it used to work>
2010-10-24T21:49:00.000Z	hardfire	Diamondcite	m trying it since past 4/5 days .

2010-10-24T21:52:00.000Z	hardfire	Diamondcite	tried lots of them docky2-stable, elementaryart/ppa , chromium-saily
2010-10-24T21:53:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Could you provide a full link please? I'm not in ubuntu right now, no access to apt
2010-10-24T21:54:00.000Z	hardfire	Diamondcite	the ppa are working fine, its the gateway that's blocking from downloading keys (i think) so i wanted to know a work around
2010-10-24T21:55:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	I wish to know one of the PPA direct address I was going to try to download a key here and then forward it to you.
2010-10-24T21:59:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Trying to see if I can get something..
2010-10-24T21:59:00.000Z	hardfire	Diamondcite	sure.. thanks for trying
2010-10-24T22:00:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Can you access http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/
2010-10-24T22:01:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	Then it should not have timed out x.x
2010-10-24T22:01:00.000Z	hardfire	Diamondcite	didnt get you
2010-10-24T22:02:00.000Z	Diamondcite	hardfire	So the command "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementaryart/ppa" times out?
