2006-07-28T05:47:00.000Z	michael		I thought I'd try again. Can anyone help me with usb support for an iPod?  It's not mounting.
2006-07-28T05:48:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Have you added it to fstab? That may stop hotplug/udev/whatever from mounting it
2006-07-28T05:49:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	 I don't know what the device name is.  It doesn't show up in dmesg
2006-07-28T05:49:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	thx for the reply btw
2006-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	It will be /dev/sdX (a, b, c, d, etc, depending on how many drives you have that are USB, SCSI or SATA)
2006-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	I think iPods use the second partition for data storage if you want to mount it manually or put it in fstab, but that may stop it from automounting when you plug it in
2006-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	can I mount it without adding a line to fstab?  Also, is there an easy way of finding out how many drives I have that are USB, SCSI etc?
2006-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	I would advise against the fstab way, since it is not a permanent drive. "fdisk -l" should show all partitions on all drives, so you should be able to guess whichis which
2006-07-28T05:52:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	Thanks for the advice. I'll let you know how it goes.
2006-07-28T05:53:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	fdisk -l only shows my physical disk drives.  Does that mean my usb isn't properly configured?
2006-07-28T05:53:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	If the iPod is plugged in it should show up. Try "lsusb" I think
2006-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
2006-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Wow, that seems really helpful :)
2006-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Try "ls /dev/sd*" and see what happens (BTW, is your hard drive USB, SCSI or SATA, or just plain IDE?)
2006-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	I know ;). That's the output of lsusb..
2006-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	2 IDE drives.  A dead IBM death star and a WD 160GB.
2006-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Then I would venture that your iPod is sda and that it's data is stored on sda2
2006-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	no such device or directory.
2006-07-28T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Wow, this is getting a little serious. Maybe "sudo modprobe usb-storage" would create the device?
2006-07-28T05:59:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	that command didn't give me any output, but the result is still the same. No /dev/sd*, no listing in fdisk.. :(
2006-07-28T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Well modprobe only gives output when there is a problem, so that is a good sign
2006-07-28T06:03:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	To be honest I don't have an iPod, and when I borrowed one from a friend for data storage it automounted fine. The only advise I know is general USB HD stuff
2006-07-28T06:04:00.000Z	michael	Warbo	well, I don't want to trouble you any further.. I'll just read the man pages for depmod and modprobe and see if I can get something happening.  An iPod should function the same as a USB HD though, correct?  If you know of any online resources, fell free to point me in that direction.
2006-07-28T06:06:00.000Z	Warbo	michael	Yes, an iPod acts like a regular USB HD for saving data, it is just the adding and removing of songs that you need a special app for like gtkpod (unless you don't want to play the music on the iPod)
