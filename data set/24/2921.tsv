2012-08-26T23:31:00.000Z	savio		which system do you using? vaio
2012-08-26T23:32:00.000Z	vaio	savio	i should probably tell you now that if i press the "suspend" button at user menu, it works. so does hibernation
2012-08-26T23:32:00.000Z	vaio		using ubuntu 10.04. vaio sz61vn
2012-08-26T23:33:00.000Z	savio	vaio	just for confirmation did you changed power option
2012-08-26T23:33:00.000Z	savio	vaio	power preference
2012-08-26T23:34:00.000Z	vaio		nope, not really savio. the first thing i tried when i installed ubuntu10.04, is close the lid and see if it worked... it didn't. all the options at the power pref. are/were as they should be.
2012-08-26T23:35:00.000Z	savio	vaio	i think you should check that option
2012-08-26T23:35:00.000Z	vaio	savio	i did check that option
2012-08-26T23:35:00.000Z	vaio		it says: when i close laptop lid, option= suspend.
2012-08-26T23:36:00.000Z	vaio		i tried to change and revert them back as they were, thinking it might be a glitch... but they do not work
2012-08-26T23:37:00.000Z	vaio		the options are there, selected, everything looks absolutely fine; i close the laptop lid, and nothing happens.
2012-08-26T23:37:00.000Z	vaio		i installed this version of ubuntu just for this. because i thought it would work. it just doesn't
2012-08-26T23:43:00.000Z	vaio		any ideas savio?
2012-08-26T23:57:00.000Z	vaio		need some help with lid actions on ubuntu 10.04... laptop lid-close/open: suspend/hibernate doesn't work. can anyone help? thanks
