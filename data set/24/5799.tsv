2006-04-26T15:20:00.000Z	vettamon		Hello all! I'm having a problem when im installing Ubuntu. When it comes to choose partition, I can't find any partition. Anyone got a clue what's going on?
2006-04-26T15:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	What setup are you starting with on the machine?
2006-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	ehm, if i got that question right, i think the answer is "default" (?)
2006-04-26T15:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Sorry, let's see if I can clarify.  Is there any operating system installed on this machine already?  Do you intend to keep it as well if so?
2006-04-26T15:26:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	Yes, i installed winxp just a couple of minutes ago. And i intend to keep it until i get used to Ubuntu.
2006-04-26T15:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Okay.  First, if you haven't already, please read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DualBootHowTo - very helpful.
2006-04-26T15:27:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	will do that
2006-04-26T15:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	What you'll need to do is a little bit scary, just because of wording and the like.  You need to shrink down the one existing partition, and then create another for Ubuntu out of the free space.
2006-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	Okej, I already got a swap and ext3 partitions. Do i have to "remake" them?
2006-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Nope, just select them and assign mountpoints.  ("Use as ...(swap, / )")
2006-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	Do i have to do that in the installation, where im suposed to pick an partition?
2006-04-26T15:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Yeah, in the part about "Manually edit partition table", you'll choose each partition, and assign the appropriate "Use as ..." from a list.
2006-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	well, that's the problem. When i get to that part, i cant find any partitions
2006-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	But you can in what, a live session?
2006-04-26T15:37:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	When i tried live, my computer just locked and i did'nt get anywhere. So i really dont know.
2006-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Okay, what's behind your statement that you already have a swap and ext3?
2006-04-26T15:39:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	I used "Acronis PartitionExpert" to make a swap and ext3.
2006-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Never even heard of it...  Does the installer at least recognize that there's an ntfs partition there?
2006-04-26T15:40:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	No
2006-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	So it says what, all free space, or no disk at all?
2006-04-26T15:41:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	no disk at all, cant see anything
2006-04-26T15:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Okay, sorry but that goes beyond the scope of what I'm comfortable trying to troubleshoot.  Stick around for a while and say it just like that every 15 minutes or so, "installer can't find a hard disk" or the like, and hopefully someone can help you soon.
2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	vettamon	tonyyarusso	Ok, thanks for your help anyway. Better than nothing ;)
2006-04-26T15:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vettamon	Good luck.
