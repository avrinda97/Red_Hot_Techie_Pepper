2005-11-27T08:18:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	ubuntu	recognises my adsl usb router and the kernel says that the adsl connection is up but i get no internet and it isn't listed in the networking proggie
2005-11-27T08:19:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		thomson speedtouch 530, ex alcatel, i can connect through the ethernet port but i need to use the usb one so that i can give the ethernet to another computer
2005-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		can't i use the usb? is there a solution to the problem? /var/log/messages says xDSL connection up and the like when i connect the usb but no connection
2005-11-27T08:21:00.000Z	rob_p	pinkisntwell	 How about setting up network address translation on your Ubuntu box and let the other PC get it's Internet connection via the Ubuntu box?
2005-11-27T08:22:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		can we stay on the problem at hand?
2005-11-27T08:23:00.000Z	rob_p	pinkisntwell	 It's just a suggestion!  If you can get ethernet connectivity to the adsl router, then NAT might be a solution.  That's all.
2005-11-27T08:24:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		okay, i know the alternatives. for a number of reasons i need to use the usb on this computer
2005-11-27T08:24:00.000Z	rob_p	pinkisntwell	 You're probably a nice enough person but you're not conveying it in here.  I wish you luck regardless.
2005-11-27T08:25:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		the modem maker doesnt give any linux drivers
2005-11-27T08:26:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		this is really great help! do any of you guys have any idea how to make ubuntu use the usb connection since the kernel can see it fine?
2005-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		ok, i'm just trying to see if it works this way because the kernel sees it for god's sake!
2005-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		what to do to locate the error? when i plug in the usb the kernel log says that usb connection is established and xDSL line is up, also detects the up/down speeds but i get no internet
2005-11-27T08:33:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		how can i run the ppp stuff?
2005-11-27T08:34:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		pppoa is setup and running on the router, i'm writing this from ubuntu now using the ethernet connection

2005-11-27T08:40:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		how can i list the devices?
2005-11-27T08:41:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		how can i see the router's device name, usb what?
2005-11-27T08:45:00.000Z	rob_p	pinkisntwell	 I'm trying to troubleshoot your issue without any hardware to work with so bear with me on this...  It looks like Breezy already has the usbnet module and probably loads it automatically upon the usb hotplug event generated by pluging the modem in.  If that's the case, it should result in (hopefully) another networking interface available on the system.
