2005-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Vaportrail	yes
2005-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	Vaportrail	crimsun	does it have a sound delay like esd?
2005-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Vaportrail	?
2005-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Vaportrail	sorry. It's much lower latency than esd because it sits at the alsa-lib level.
2005-01-19T07:19:00.000Z	Vaportrail	crimsun	so I can expect, that the sound doesn't appear 2 secs after releasing it?
2005-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	Vaportrail	crimsun	did you test it on ubuntu, no or?
2005-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Vaportrail	yes.
