2008-05-04T04:34:00.000Z	SnakeArt		How to get an info about modules loaded on bootup and then after modprobe command?
2008-05-04T04:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	missed a lot.. are you trying to get your wacom working? if so which one.?
2008-05-04T04:36:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	Yeah. I have only three devices in gimp or wacomcpl : pad, eraser and cursor ,but no stylus.
2008-05-04T04:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	I'll pastbin my xorg for you.. mine works.. graphire 4
2008-05-04T04:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	http://pastebin.com/f47307863
2008-05-04T04:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	have you loaded wacom-tools? also you should compare my xorg with yours to see the diff.
2008-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	also .. hardy should have built in support for wacom without having to modprobe anything.
2008-05-04T04:42:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	It's the same. I see that You still have these 'forcedevice' parts. You mean, that I need to reinstall wacom-tools? Oh, BTW: I'm using 7.10 (2.6.22-14-generic)
2008-05-04T04:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	I have them but I've commented them out.  I did have them in for Feisty and commented out the lines with "usb" and it worked.. might try that
2008-05-04T04:44:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	Ok. I will. Tnx.
2008-05-04T04:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	np
2008-05-04T05:03:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	Are You there?
2008-05-04T05:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	yep
2008-05-04T05:03:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	So, it doesn't work. I'll send you pastebin. Wait.
2008-05-04T05:04:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/9878/
2008-05-04T05:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	send me xorg..
2008-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	also looks like maybe compiz is interfearing with wacom on your system.. it registers then unregisters..
2008-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	with a seg fault on compiz
2008-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	incoming...http://paste.ubuntu.com/9879/
2008-05-04T05:07:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	I've commented out these 'usb'-related lines, but still no effect
2008-05-04T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	looking at xorg now.. hang on.
2008-05-04T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	SnakeArt	add the line ( Option ForceDevice "ISDV4" )# Tablet PC Only to all the "InputDevice" lines dealing with wacom..
2008-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	Ok. I'll try that.
2008-05-04T05:28:00.000Z	SnakeArt	Scunizi	And nothing again. I've edited xorg, just as You've told me, but still no movement and still no 'stylus' device
