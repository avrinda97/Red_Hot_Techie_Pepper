2008-11-12T06:46:00.000Z	PeskyJ		how do I see if a package is installed or not?
2008-11-12T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	apt-cache policy PACKAGE
2008-11-12T06:46:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	ta :)
2008-11-18T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	what kind of development questions?
2008-11-18T18:10:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	like how does X, Y, and Z  work (under the hood)? I want to know more about how drag and drop works on a coding level
2008-11-18T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	in gnome?  try #gtk on gimpnet (there's probably one on freenode too) I guess
2008-11-18T18:12:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	ok, ta
2008-11-18T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	erm, #gtk+
2008-12-13T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	ignore that.  Just install the flashplugin-nonfree package from the multiverse repository using your favorite package manager
2008-12-13T18:18:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	I thionk I just uninstalled that, it's the 32-bit version and doesn't play nice in 64-bit firefox (mostly works but flickers a lot and some stuff doesn't work properly at all)
2008-12-13T18:19:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	WIGGMPk I want to try the 64-bit alpha to see if it gets on better
2008-12-13T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	uninstall flashplugin-nonfree and copy the libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins/ then
2008-12-13T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	there are several.  You may not be using flashplugin-nonfree at all...
2008-12-13T18:27:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	when I right-clicked in it and did "about flash player 10" it would go to the adobe site.. does that mean it was the non-free version?
2008-12-13T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	yes
2008-12-13T18:46:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	I tried putting the library in /usr/share/mozilla/plugins but firefox doesn't pick it up... it works fine in ~/.mozilla/plugins, but I'd rather have one place instead of installing it for all users separately
2008-12-13T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	/usr/lib/firefox/plugins/ should work
2008-12-13T18:47:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	ok, thanks :) bit of a mind-bend trying to work out where things should go sometimes
2008-12-13T18:51:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	hrm.. /usr/lib/firefox/plugins didn't seem to work - doesn't get picked up
2008-12-13T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	are you sure?  What does "about:plugins" look like?
2008-12-13T18:53:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	hehe.. you're having the same conversation... I checked that already and tools->addons->plugins
2008-12-13T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	PeskyJ	ok, but what does it say?  Can you pastebin it?
2008-12-13T18:55:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	ok, http://pastebin.com/d26ca0a0
2008-12-13T19:21:00.000Z	PeskyJ	jrib	FYI: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins worked in the end :) but confusing with both 'firefox' and 'mozilla' directories in /usr/lib and /usr/share, got the right one in the end though
