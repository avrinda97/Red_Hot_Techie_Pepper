2005-10-08T15:04:00.000Z	pschulz01		Has anyone here tried to install ubuntu on an 'ipod' as an external usb drive? Colony 4 almost worked, but I had some problems with grub.
2005-10-08T15:05:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	I have installed heaps of distros on external usb drives, most often u get a kernel panic VFS unable to sync root filesystem, is that what you got? if so theres an easy fix
2005-10-08T15:06:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	No.. the installer corrupted the previously installed Redhat grub configuration (hda) rather than the usb drive (sda).
2005-10-08T15:09:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	How do you do that? grub; root (sda1); setup(sda) ?
2005-10-08T15:10:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Yeah... the machine that I was installing from only has USB FD option, so I couldn't test the install.
2005-10-08T15:11:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	How do I go about  raising this as a possible bug?
2005-10-08T15:19:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Thanks.. I'm wandering over to 'ubuntu-devel'
2005-10-11T16:35:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	what happens when you execute cfdisk
2005-10-11T16:36:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Free space 80 Gb
2005-10-11T16:37:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	But /proc/partitions shows 4 partitions.. so I may be able to rebuild
2005-10-11T16:38:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	you will be able to, gimme a tic
2005-10-11T16:38:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	It was a 'dd' that went horribly wrong. (hda instead of sda)
2005-10-11T16:38:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Friends don't let friends drink and dd.
2005-10-11T16:39:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	ha ha
2005-10-11T16:39:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	It's one of my more faviourite tools.
2005-10-11T16:39:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	have u seen this yet http://www.linux.com/howtos/Partition/recovering.shtml
2005-10-11T16:42:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	did u take a look, perhaps gpart or TestDisk will help first, otherwise you can follow those instructions
2005-10-11T16:45:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	I'm happy to use 'cfdisk'.. but I'm going to have to reinstall the boot loader.
2005-10-11T16:45:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	It's a mac mini.. so it not lilo.
2005-10-11T16:47:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	What are blocks measured in? cfdisk wants 'sectors' or 'cylinders'.
2005-10-11T16:48:00.000Z	propagandhi	pschulz01	the formula was on that page wasnt it
2005-10-11T16:51:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Sorry.. didn't get message with instruction location.
2005-10-11T16:52:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Thanks.
2005-10-11T05:08:00.000Z	pschulz01	propagandhi	Thanks for your help. It was a good read. I'm going to reinstall anyway.
