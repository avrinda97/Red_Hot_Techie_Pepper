2012-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	Jonii_		Hey, is there a way to stop Ubuntu 11.10 recording everything I do?
2012-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	what is it recording exactly?
2012-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	and where does it record them to?
2012-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	how should I know?
2012-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	so you don't know what's recorded or where to, you need to chillout dude
2012-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	it doesn't record anything
2012-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	there is no recording, there is internet history like ANY OS
2012-01-07T06:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	there are logs for dpkg and udev which are lost on reboot and are useful for debugging issues
2012-01-07T06:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	there isn't anything to stop, there is no recording of any sort
2012-01-07T06:44:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	sure it does. Press windows-button to enter dash, and view programs or files&folders tab. Giving that blatantly false advice is weird and dangerous and creepy, mind you
2012-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	those are the recent docs, then file suggestion based on the contents of your home folder
2012-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	I don't use unity, hitting windows key brings up my lxmenu
2012-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	yes. I know. And why are recent docs recorded? Why are commonly used programs recorded?
2012-01-07T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	convenience, so you can run them faster, windows does that too in the 2 bar start menu style...
2012-01-07T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	http://askubuntu.com/questions/34592/how-to-clear-recently-used-files-without-using-a-terminal   may also clear the apps list, Ive never met anyone as paranoid as you. I bet you walk the streets with tinfoil on your head
2012-01-07T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	you can use gnome tweak tool to make it not record the recent docs
2012-01-07T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	people can hack in or steal your password and then access your system at any time, recent docs list or not
2012-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	its a netbook. It can easily be stolen, and it has ridiculous amounts of sensitive data about me, exact nature and extent of data is unknown to me, and i really don't like diving into finding out all the ways this data could be used against me
2012-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	then use encryptfs and keep a backup, no need to worry then
2012-01-07T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	using encryptfs will mean that if the drive is removed or such, the data will be garbage
2012-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	yeah, i've thought of using that
2012-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	you should if you are THAT paranoid
2012-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	Jonii_	ActionParsnip	I know. It embarrasses me a bit that I haven't done that :/
2012-06-15T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jonii_	in what way, switch teh entire layout or just one key?
