2011-09-21T17:39:00.000Z	lovre		 I have a wireless connection but it reports only 1MBps, instead of 54Mbps.. Any ideas to fix this?
2011-09-21T17:40:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	Where does it report this?
2011-09-21T17:40:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	in the tray application, and also when i type iwconfig
2011-09-21T17:41:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	Do you have a weak signal?
2011-09-21T17:41:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	50% signal
2011-09-21T17:41:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	It's probably a limitation of the driver.  have you noticed that it's slow? i.e. if you download something are you actually limited to 1Mb/s ?
2011-09-21T17:42:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	yes, its slow
2011-09-21T17:42:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	Probably a limitation of the driver.  What card is this?

2011-09-21T17:46:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	what I'm not familiar with this card.  Read about it here: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/zd1211rw/devices?highlight=%28tl-wn422g%29
2011-09-21T17:47:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	and here: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k_htc/devices?highlight=%28tl-wn422g%29   unfortunately the link is broken right now
2011-09-21T17:47:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	i have found this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=768301
2011-09-21T17:48:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	but when i do this command: sudo iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M, i get this error: SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.
2011-09-21T17:48:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	limitation of the driver
2011-09-21T17:49:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	that's wireless N so you should be able to get 300Mb/s
2011-09-21T17:49:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	so you believe its the driver that doesnt allow faster than 1mbps
2011-09-21T17:49:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	yes
2011-09-21T17:49:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	:(
2011-09-21T17:49:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	i didnt even install any driver for this, it was automatically recognised... Maybe thats the problem
2011-09-21T17:50:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	i thought since its recognized it should work. but it uses generic drivers probably
2011-09-21T17:50:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	what are my options if there arent linux drivers for this wireless module? Can i try any other 'generic' ones
2011-09-21T17:51:00.000Z	edbian	lovre	any driver you use will be a 'linux' driver.  Sometimes the manufacturer will put out a driver (a linux driver).  I am not familiar with the drivers for this device.  That's the point of the river
2011-09-21T17:52:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	yes, i know, i was wondering if there are 'generic' drivers i could try, like third party or something... Im going to try to down the interface and set the speed, see if that helps. Be back in a bit
2011-09-21T17:54:00.000Z	lovre	edbian	what does 'Mode' option mean, i can set it to 'Infrastructure' or 'Ad-hoc'?
