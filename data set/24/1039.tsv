2011-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	pikpik		Hi. Is it possible to run .desktop files from Terminal?
2011-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	no need, run the app that the desktop file is associated with in terminal
2011-12-21T11:48:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	It's a Windows executable associated with WINE.
2011-12-21T11:49:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	I'm trying to make the program executable from "Dash home."
2011-12-21T11:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	what is 'dashhome'??
2011-12-21T11:56:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Oh, sorry. "Dash": http://www.ubuntu.com/sites/www.ubuntu.com/files/active/images/oneiric-features-overview-dash.jpg
2011-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	In a nutshell, I'm trying to make Spotify look native (even though I'm using WINE).
2011-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	I am sort of lost, so you want to click on an exe file in dashhome
2011-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Exactly.
2011-12-21T11:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	but only .desktop files are shown, right?
2011-12-21T11:58:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	In dash/dash home? I'm not sure; I'm new to it. :\
2011-12-21T11:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	pretty sure that a .desktop file needs to exist to be seen in 'dashhome'
2011-12-21T12:01:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Hmmm... ok.
2011-12-21T12:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	which is why I gave on it and its gnome3 version and installed cairo-dock, so I could have handy access to anything I wanted with the click of the mouse, of course it does take adding the app/prog to it
2011-12-21T12:05:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Yeah... I'm trying to do something minimal for another user. So, I'd like to not install anything more than WINE, if reasonably possible.
2011-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	doesn't wine offer up installed apps in a menu in dash? right side?
2011-12-21T12:13:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	I thought so, but I don't see it.
2011-12-21T12:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	it may only exist in the 2d desktop
2011-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Ok.
2011-12-21T12:22:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Ah! I put Spotify.desktop in /usr/share/applications, and it shows up in "dashhome" and acts native now! :D
2011-12-21T12:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	what is 'spotify?
2011-12-21T12:23:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	http://www.spotify.com/us/about/what/ --> http://www.spotify.com/us/help/faq/wine/
2011-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	pikpik	almoxarife	Thanks for helping. :)
2011-12-21T12:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	pikpik	:)
