2010-03-15T06:44:00.000Z	haakon87		But it's not recommended.
2010-03-15T06:45:00.000Z	haakon87		calculating the sorrow for alien however, is merely np-complete.
2010-03-15T06:46:00.000Z	haakon87		You know murphy's law?
2010-03-15T06:46:00.000Z	haakon87		You're tempting it nfm, and that's not a good thing.
2010-03-15T06:47:00.000Z	haakon87		But if you really, absolutely must have something, and it's not available as a deb, or as source, then you can use alien. But most likely the package won't install properly and you have to spend some manner of time running around in a massive terminal FUBAR and removeing stuff by hand.
2010-03-15T06:47:00.000Z	haakon87		Not really explode, just force you to have fun with a recovery shell because rpm just got root and decided to add random stuff to things.
2010-03-15T06:48:00.000Z	haakon87		*have a painful memory of scheme and poor documentation not mentioning guile...*
2010-03-15T06:48:00.000Z	haakon87		Oh well, I learned from that.
2010-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	haakon87		kramer3d:
2010-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	haakon87		What is adb?
2010-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	kramer3d	haakon87	its a application i  have in a nother folder
2010-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	haakon87		Because if it's just one program in a terminal, it's better to just use alias.
2010-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	kramer3d	haakon87	how do i do that
2010-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	haakon87	kramer3d	Just open .bashrc, and on the last line, add "alias adb='<path to program>/<program name>'"
2010-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	kramer3d		ok thanks
2010-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	kramer3d	haakon87	how come editing the path didnt work
2010-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	kramer3d		i did
2010-03-15T06:53:00.000Z	kramer3d		PATH = $PATH:\dir\
2010-03-15T06:53:00.000Z	haakon87		That's WINDOWS syntax.
2010-03-15T06:53:00.000Z	kramer3d		:o
2010-03-15T06:54:00.000Z	haakon87		But after you've added the line to .bashrc you'll have to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect. Also, you should always keep a backup of the old .bashrc in case something goes wrong.
2010-03-15T06:55:00.000Z	haakon87		as for AAC in rythmbox, have you installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly ?
2010-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	haakon87		Wait, kramer3d, I think I messed up. Sorry for that, I misread your comment about setting the path.
2010-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	kramer3d	haakon87	what?
