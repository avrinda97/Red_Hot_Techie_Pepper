2009-06-09T22:54:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	sounds like something got munged, is there anything else on the screen?any errors? can you get to a terminal?  (alt f2)
2009-06-09T22:55:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	:i got  soft lock : CPU#0 stuck for 11s [init:1]
2009-06-09T22:56:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	i've encountered that before and it's due to filesystem corruption, use a fsck and force the rebuild, i don't recall the exact command
2009-06-09T22:57:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	i can't get into the console to do a fsck !
2009-06-09T22:57:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	you need to use a live cd, either your ubuntu disk or a knoppix disk
2009-06-09T22:58:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	i did a fsck earlier, reported some errors..& the console got stuck
2009-06-09T22:58:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	ok..
2009-06-09T22:58:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	fsck --force /dev/sd1   (or whathaveyou)
2009-06-09T23:01:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	what will when i run this "fsck --force /dev/sd1" will the errors get corrected ?
2009-06-09T23:01:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	it did for me, but your mileage may vary
2009-06-09T23:01:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	what will happen when i run this "fsck --force /dev/sd1" will the errors get corrected ?
2009-06-09T23:03:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	are you using a seagate drive over 750gb?
2009-06-09T23:03:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	160gb seagate..
2009-06-09T23:04:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	40gb for ubuntu, remaining for winne...
2009-06-09T23:04:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	yeah, i'd run the fsck, and contact customer support if it's still bad and get a replacement if it's under warranty
2009-06-09T23:05:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	what is this "soft lock : cpu#0 stuck for 11s" ?
2009-06-09T23:06:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	this code detects soft lockups: incidents in where on a CPU the kernel does not reschedule for 10 seconds or more
2009-06-09T23:07:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	i am getting this softlock "bug" after a unsuccessful fsck...
2009-06-09T23:08:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	you ran the force?
2009-06-09T23:08:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	no.
2009-06-09T23:08:00.000Z	frostburn	msk	go do that and see if it still persists
2009-06-09T23:09:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	k.
2009-06-09T23:12:00.000Z	msk	frostburn	i will do fsck with force option, thanks for suggestion....
