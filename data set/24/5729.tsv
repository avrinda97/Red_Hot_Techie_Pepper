2009-02-04T17:00:00.000Z	streetchariot		Hello
2009-02-04T17:00:00.000Z	streetchariot		Is anyone else having issues with broadcom wireless cards after the kernel update?
2009-02-04T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	nope, on one now, now problem
2009-02-04T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	sorry - I'm telling lies, I'm not, my current card is intel, my wired one i broadcom
2009-02-04T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	it won't be anything to do with network if the card isn't working
2009-02-04T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	check the syslog for a good start
2009-02-04T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	well thats not good
2009-02-04T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	are you not missing the system.map for the 11 kernel though ?
2009-02-04T18:00:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	should have been installed with the kernel
2009-02-04T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	no - they dissapear when you remove the kernel
2009-02-04T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	yes, use the package manager and the "re-install" option
2009-02-04T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	use a cable
2009-02-04T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	ubuntu server install cd isn't a livecd
2009-02-04T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	why 791 ?
2009-02-04T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	how do you know his card supports that resolution
2009-02-04T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	and what makes you think this is a framebuffer issue ?
2009-02-04T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	no that doesn't force a "standard" res - that hard codes the frmaebuffer to  a specific resolution
2009-02-04T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	no screens found is nothing to do with the "vga" option
2009-02-04T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	no screens found is "xorg"
2009-02-04T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	xorg is nothing to do with the "vga" option
2009-02-04T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	and vga=791 is a very specific resolution - not a "standard" resollution
2009-02-04T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	that command is for the frame buffer - not xorg
2009-02-04T18:31:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	don't pretend it's because your tired - just say "I don't know"
2009-02-04T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	streetchariot	secure graphics mode ?
