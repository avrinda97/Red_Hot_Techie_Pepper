2009-12-26T06:46:00.000Z	sixtila		grub help needed, i have grub2 in debian and want to include ubuntu in it(which is in my other partition)
2009-12-26T06:46:00.000Z	bazhang	sixtila	debian? this is for ubuntu support; try #debian
2009-12-26T06:47:00.000Z	sixtila	bazhang	both have grub2, and when i loginto ubuntu - it says LOAD KERNEL FIRST -
2009-12-26T06:47:00.000Z	sixtila	bazhang	and the debian room is sleeping
2009-12-26T06:48:00.000Z	bazhang	sixtila	no idea how debian does it, for ubuntu it is sudo update-grub (for grub2) but you should really be patient and ask there as I don't know if it is different
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	sixtila	bazhang	i have already downloaded grub2 - i tried copying line from ubuntu grub to debian grub (cause they are both same)
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	bazhang	sixtila	debian being asleep is not a reason to ask here
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	sixtila	bazhang	and the ubuntu says please load the kernel first - so it is problem with my grub editing
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	bazhang	sixtila	sudo update-grub for ubuntu, no idea about debian
