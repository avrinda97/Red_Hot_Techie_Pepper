2009-06-02T14:38:00.000Z	hdon		so i need to boot from usb flash memory. i'm reading https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromCForUSBStick but my problem is that it's now asking me to copy some files onto it from my system, and i'm not running ubuntu. is it reasonable to expect /boot/grub to be compatible between Debian 4.0 and Ubuntu?
2009-06-02T14:38:00.000Z	hdon		(boot as in boot the installer)
2009-06-02T14:39:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	if you are booting from usb you likely wont use grub but instead syslinux
2009-06-02T14:42:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	oh i just discovered "boot.img.gz" in hd-media, can i use that to install ubuntu from usb flash?
2009-06-02T14:43:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	make a bootable usb install from the utility in >admin it will make the filesystem bootable itself , you just provide the iso
2009-06-02T14:44:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	what is ">admin" ?
2009-06-02T14:45:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	i'm not on ubuntu right now. this will be my first time trying it. i've already used fdisk to set up the partition table on my usb flash media
2009-06-02T14:45:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	use the live disk, you will need to reformat your usb key to fat or fat32 anyway for syslinux to boot
2009-06-02T14:46:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	what is a "live disk?"
2009-06-02T14:48:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	to install from usb you still need the iso
2009-06-02T14:49:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	no problem
2009-06-02T14:50:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	you can use unetbootin alternatively to prepare the usb drive from the iso,
2009-06-02T14:52:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	what are you using?
2009-06-02T14:52:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	Debian
2009-06-02T14:53:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	then use unetbootin to prepare the key
2009-06-02T14:54:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	Debian 4.0. why do i have to use some easy program to do it? this really isn't that hard, i just have to know what files to include
2009-06-02T14:55:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	because its not like installing to a hard drive as you use syslinux , its a compressed image like a live disk,
2009-06-02T14:55:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	doesn't sound that intimidating
2009-06-02T15:13:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	where do you work, the moon?
2009-06-02T15:13:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	the company i work for does a lot of FOSS stuff
2009-06-02T15:17:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	with unetbootin, when it asks me to specify a target, should i specify the partition or the entire block device? (/dev/sda or /dev/sda1?)
2009-06-02T15:18:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	it should detect the mounted usb device,
2009-06-02T15:18:00.000Z	hdon	koshari	it did, i just wanted to make sure that was correct
2009-06-02T15:19:00.000Z	koshari	hdon	*tick* and it will want the partitiion, so sda1 ect will be the target
