2009-11-29T01:48:00.000Z	ejcweb		I have installed Ubuntu on my Dell laptop, and it seems to work fine. However, the laptop fan is now permanently on (making quite a noise) as compared with fairly un-noticeable fan usage when I boot into Windows. Is there something wrong?
2009-11-29T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	websearch for the model in conjuction with ubuntu, there may be a bug report or guide
2009-11-29T02:13:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	I've googled my laptop fan issue, and discovered several posts on various forums confirming that others have experienced this. But it doesn't seem specific to my own laptop; many other get this too. Is it that Ubuntu simply doesn't control the fan at all and leaves it on?
2009-11-29T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	in some cases yes, seems you may need some boot options or somesuch, dellare very documented so you may find guides
2010-01-18T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	one is older than the other. you can remove thee -11 kernel if you do not use it
2010-01-18T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	edit /etc/default/grub    then run: sudo update-grub
2010-01-18T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	assuming karmic is you release
2012-06-20T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	when you want to detatch the device, do you just yank it out or do you safetly remove the device, then unplug?
2012-06-20T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	what file system is it using?
2012-06-20T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	NTFS? FAT32? Ext2/3/4 ??
2012-06-20T14:51:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	It says msdos under properties. How do I check?
2012-06-20T14:52:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'
2012-06-20T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	oh jeez
2012-06-20T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	I suggest you fsck the partition, may help
2012-06-20T14:56:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	What does fsck do exactly?
2012-06-20T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	its like chkdsk in windows
2012-06-20T14:58:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	If the drive shows up as /media/HD-CUE2 then I can just fsck /media/HD-CUE2?
2012-06-20T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	you need to unmount the partition first
2012-06-20T15:02:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	fsck says 'Bad short file name (\031\000\000\000B \000I.\000n\000).', and gives options to drop file, rename etc. What is this doing/what should I do?
2012-06-20T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	Fat32 isn't very robust. I suggest you chkdsk in Windows
2012-06-20T15:12:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	With the hope that chkdsk might do what?
2012-06-20T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	repair the file system. Sounds like it's not being used correctly (afe removal in the OS before pysical removal)
2012-06-20T15:13:00.000Z	ejcweb	ActionParsnip	Ok. I will reboot into windows and try chkdsk, and if that doesn't do the trick, give PhotoRec a try.
2012-06-20T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ejcweb	tell your buddy to get a backup in place
