2012-09-23T03:32:00.000Z	Cosman246		I need some help
2012-09-23T03:32:00.000Z	Cosman246		I tried to upgrade to Xubuntu
2012-09-23T03:32:00.000Z	Cosman246		with the instructions in http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfceoneiric
2012-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	Cosman246		Long story short, it broke my packages and now I can't install ubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop
2012-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	Cosman246		What should I do?
2012-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	Cosman246		sudo apt-get install -f doesn't work
2012-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	Cosman246		neither does sudo apt-get remove -f
2012-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	Cosman246		or dpkg -i --configure -a

2012-09-23T03:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	Not sure what you mean by upgrade that is just a desktop enviroment change.
2012-09-23T03:37:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	Were you or are you running 11.10?
2012-09-23T03:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	If you can give a more indepth explanation of where you are it might help, be sure to include the nick of who you're talning to when you are.
2012-09-23T03:39:00.000Z	Cosman246	wilee-nilee	what info would be relevant here?
2012-09-23T03:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	Have you looked at yout apt/sources.list have you changed it perchance
2012-09-23T03:40:00.000Z	Cosman246	wilee-nilee	I looked at it
2012-09-23T03:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	There is a sentence that says in sure to be safe backup your setup did you do that?
2012-09-23T03:42:00.000Z	Cosman246	wilee-nilee	No, and therein lies a fault
2012-09-23T03:43:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	Ah I hope you get kit fixed, but a clone of your OS goes a long way, personally I use clonezilla on every install.
2012-09-23T03:43:00.000Z	Cosman246	wilee-nilee	thanks
2012-09-23T03:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Cosman246	Are there any PPA's in the etc/apt/sources.list.d
