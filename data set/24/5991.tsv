2006-03-17T08:26:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	chuckyp	it says it is in readonly
2006-03-17T08:27:00.000Z	chuckyp	Ropechoborra	you need to edit it using sudo
2006-03-17T08:27:00.000Z	chuckyp	Ropechoborra	so you would do sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf or sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf  that way you can write the file since you need root to do it.
