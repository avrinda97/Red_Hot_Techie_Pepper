2007-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	Yarcanox		does anyone know the apt-get-name of the qt opengl extension, I just can't find it
2007-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I find tons of python gl stuff, mesa packages etc and installed some of them
2007-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	Yarcanox		how can I do that ikonia
2007-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I tried aptitude search
2007-08-09T09:58:00.000Z	Yarcanox		but it even existed on suse ikonia o.O
2007-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Yarcanox		yea I know, but I thought ubuntu would have the package if suse does
2007-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Yarcanox		as ubuntu seems to have a bigger package base
2007-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	Yarcanox		:/
2007-08-09T09:59:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	have you enabled universe?
2007-08-09T10:00:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	system -> administration -> software sources
2007-08-09T10:01:00.000Z	Yarcanox	jrib	there's nothing like universe
2007-08-09T10:02:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	it's the second checkbox on the first tab:  "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)"
2007-08-09T10:03:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	apt-cache search qt opengl    turns up a bunch of packages here
2007-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	what do you mean by "deactivate" exactly?
2007-08-30T14:38:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	system -> administration -> services  tell gdm not to start
2007-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	then read 'man update-rc.d' or install sysv-rc-conf and use that
2007-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	Yarcanox	jrib	I need something like setting the init level to 3
2007-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	no, because 2-5 are the same on ubuntu.  Why do you want to do this?
2007-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	yes
2007-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	Yarcanox	jrib	you could keep this very easy answer for the next guy asking :)
2007-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	the man page for update-rc.d explains that
2007-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	fair enough :)
2007-10-31T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	there are pitivi and kino as well
2008-05-24T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	Yarcanox	dpkg -L PACKAGE | grep bin   may get you closer
