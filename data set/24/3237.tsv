2008-03-21T06:16:00.000Z	Tempo-		Ok. after looking on the ubuntu wiki and forum, none of my usb wireless network cards are supported. I really want unternet for my ubuntu computer, but don't want to run a cable all through the house. am i screwed?
2008-03-21T06:17:00.000Z	Tempo-		Fryguy: don't have a pci wireless card. don't know what a wap is (or a repeater for that matter)
2008-03-21T06:17:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	you can buy another, cheap, guaranteed-to-work card. That way you support those who release drivers and cooperate with open source.
2008-03-21T06:18:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	it is 7 at night, it is alittle late to go do anything right now.
2008-03-21T06:18:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	what are these cards you have that don't work?
2008-03-21T06:18:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	well I don't mean buy them right now! I mean next time you have the time.
2008-03-21T06:19:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	the drivers are already compiled when you install the distribution so getting and compiling source most probably won't do anything better.
2008-03-21T06:19:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	i got it. that was my attempt at sarcasm. guess i forgot to stretch my sarcasm muscle
2008-03-21T06:21:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	you are hilarious. I like you. Anyway. Which cards are these? I need to know which not to buy.
2008-03-21T06:23:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	the last resort would be to use "ndiswrapper" to use your windows XP drivers in linux. But since you checked the wikis and forums...
2008-03-21T06:24:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	Ndiswrapper? is that like wine?
2008-03-21T06:25:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	it is only good for network drivers, search the term NDIS (wikipedia).
2008-03-21T06:25:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	thanks for the help.
2008-03-21T06:30:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	alright. so if it isn't in the wiki or the forum it won't work, period?
2008-03-21T06:30:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	most probably. But I need to know the model. Maybe I can search better than you.
2008-03-21T06:31:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	d-link wua 1340
2008-03-21T06:32:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	potato but yes, if it doesn't appear on the forums, congratulations your device is unique. Only you possess it in the whole planet.
2008-03-21T06:33:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	before you go to far searching for me, keep in mind that i have only looked at the official ubuntu documentation. i did a quick google search too. I'll search for a while than come back if i need help or run out of ideas.
2008-03-21T06:34:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	here is a link I just found. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/D-Link_WUA-1340
2008-03-21T06:35:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	I'll try that and come back to you
2008-03-21T06:36:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	oh yes. I've heard of WICD before. I've never used it.
2008-03-21T06:36:00.000Z	Tempo-	vocx	i will try wicd. thanks for all of your help!
2008-03-21T06:44:00.000Z	vocx	Tempo-	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=506907&highlight=dlink+1340
