2007-05-30T16:12:00.000Z	garryFre		I'm reading a lot of chatter about slow fiesty booting in up to 10 minutes, mine takes about an hour to 90 minutes, I beat the record, do I get a donut for this?  :)
2007-05-30T16:12:00.000Z	garryFre		yeah, mine booted in about 40 seconds, not bad, before teh latest patch
2007-05-30T16:12:00.000Z	garryFre		hehe
2007-05-30T16:13:00.000Z	garryFre		Hey, how bout a cheese donut so I can have it with my whine. :)
2007-05-30T16:14:00.000Z	garryFre		just at boot up, yet this same kernel version works on LTS, when I restored to that.
2007-05-30T16:15:00.000Z	garryFre		Well, I know that thte /dev/sda is wrong. However, when I tried to do a fresh feisty or is that fiesty fresh install, all drives were listed as /dev/sdx
2007-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	garryFre		then it wrote over my windows drive .... Oops!
2007-05-30T16:16:00.000Z	garryFre		the /dev/hdd was not the fourth physical drive, but the # of the drive as listed in bios ordering.
2007-05-30T16:17:00.000Z	victory747	garryFre	Yes, but you shouldn't really change it abruptly can you?
2007-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	garryFre	victory747	if you mean the version of ubuntu, I have a backup and restore, and this problem only showed when I applied updates saturday
2007-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	garryFre		So we can walk and chew gum same time.
2007-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	victory747	garryFre	I'm not sure when the update happened, but it still shows /dev/sda with the previous kernel
2007-05-30T16:19:00.000Z	garryFre		Sorry, the horror of losing a hard drive makes my humor overactive.
2007-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	garryFre	victory747	oh ok, I see, yeah, it sounds like it was a bug and it got fixed.
2007-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	victory747	garryFre	It was fixed?  When?
2007-05-30T16:20:00.000Z	victory747		it's definitlye a bug
2007-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	garryFre	victory747	I dunno, I'm guessing it's fixed because an ide should never be referred to as sdanything but as hdx
2007-05-30T16:21:00.000Z	garryFre		Psychic C++
2007-05-30T16:22:00.000Z	garryFre		or Psychicperl
2007-05-30T16:22:00.000Z	victory747	garryFre	Well, I would agree, but it's been that way since I installed feisty beta.  I thought it was a new interface in the kernel to show them all as scsi interface
2007-05-30T16:23:00.000Z	victory747	garryFre	 I hate to seee things change on people mid-stream - not good for newbies
2007-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	garryFre		yep, and it seems the image files don't have the fix for when I tried installing feisty from a cd I made with the latest iso image, it listed all my drives as /sda ... /sdd
2007-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	garryFre		oops mt
2007-05-30T16:24:00.000Z	garryFre	victory747	and then that's when it ate wondows
