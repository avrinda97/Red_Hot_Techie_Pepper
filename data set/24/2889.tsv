2008-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	not if it is its own machine... but if it is a virtual machine running in vista then yes
2008-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	im running Vista as a host.  Ubuntu as a wm and guest.  So if Vista is infected with a keylogger, the keylogger will be able to keylog everything I do in ubuntu too?
2008-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	yes because your still running Vista, and it logs every keystroke there, so it logs the key strokes going to the VM
2008-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	thats bad news then
2008-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	dual boot instead of running the vm
2008-08-04T06:53:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	yeah i was hoping to avoid that
2008-08-04T06:57:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	just things that run at low level like that...
2008-08-04T06:57:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	its not a security breach in ubuntu just in windows
2008-08-04T06:57:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	yeah i understand, thanks for explaining !  bad news though :(
2008-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	install ubuntu to a thumb drive and boot off of that
2008-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	i tried that but i can never get the thumbstick to boot lol
2008-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	make sure the bios is set to boot from usb first
2008-08-04T06:58:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	unless I run a windows securioty program that checks for keyloggers?
2008-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	yea but it wont help with key loggers
2008-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	packet sniffing :)
2008-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	besides keyloggers. anything else that can be a security breach?
2008-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	so keyloggers and packet sniffing.  anything else? lol
2008-08-04T07:01:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	what is packet sniffing? heh
2008-08-04T07:02:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	your running ubuntu right now right?
2008-08-04T07:02:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	open a terminal and type 'sudo tcpdump'
2008-08-04T07:03:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	open a terminal and type 'sudo tcpdump -vv'
2008-08-04T07:04:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	ok brb
2008-08-04T07:05:00.000Z	lisa_	npope	I typed sudo tcpdump -vv. nlow what?
2008-08-04T07:05:00.000Z	npope	lisa_	basically tcpdump takes the packets off the wire... read 'man tcpdump'
