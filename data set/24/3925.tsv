2008-11-12T07:47:00.000Z	mindrape	endo602	- you can dpkg-reconfigure your alsa probably...
2008-11-12T07:48:00.000Z	endo602	mindrape	says alsa is not installed
2008-11-12T07:49:00.000Z	endo602	mindrape	says alsa base
2008-11-12T07:49:00.000Z	endo602	mindrape	I just did sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base
2008-11-12T07:52:00.000Z	mindrape	endo602	what is the issue exactly?  No sound?
2008-11-12T07:53:00.000Z	endo602	mindrape	yes and I think i really messed my alsa driver up
2008-11-12T07:53:00.000Z	mindrape	endo602	- lspci do you see your soundcard?
2008-11-12T07:53:00.000Z	mindrape	endo602	- lsmod do you see modules loaded for your soundcard?

2008-11-12T07:58:00.000Z	endo602	mindrape	gnome alsa mixer doesnt detect a soundcard, is there a way to set sound to defualt (like after install of 8.10) or do i have to just do a hard install?
