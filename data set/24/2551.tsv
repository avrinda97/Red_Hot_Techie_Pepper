2008-11-09T04:45:00.000Z	NekroJakub		Man, Ubuntu runs sooo much smoother than Kubuntu
2008-11-09T04:45:00.000Z	NekroJakub		KDE4 is really bloated...
2008-11-09T04:46:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	I have read the same things about that. That Gnome is faster and such.
2008-11-10T03:17:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	I'm using it atm, but I can't get global shortcuts to work and I can't make it my defult.
2008-11-10T03:20:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	I think, now I could be wrong, but I think you can change it by using this command "gksudo gedit /etc/gnome/defaults.list" and then editing some options.
2008-11-10T03:21:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	So many entries to edit T_T
2008-11-10T03:22:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	No problem. I think if you find the x-content/audio sections, and change the "rhythmbox.desktop" to "amarok.desktop" you should be good.
2008-11-10T03:23:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	Only change the variabled that are after the = sign.
2008-11-10T03:24:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	Try that, see what happens. If it does not work, changing them back might be a good idea.
2008-11-10T03:24:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	And of course save the file when you are done. :P Forgot that almost.
2008-11-10T03:25:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	I'll try that if I can't find anything else, there's bound to be some option here...
2008-11-10T03:26:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	There may very well be. I wish I knew more. The fix I showed you is something I read on one of the Multimedia Sticky's on Ubuntu Forums.
2008-11-10T03:26:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	I'm just a noob myself. Trying to figure things out.
2008-11-10T03:27:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	Where's the option to edit as root?
2008-11-10T03:28:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	You mean with the code I gave you that opens your default programs list?
2008-11-10T03:28:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	Oh right, I found the file manually...
2008-11-10T03:29:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	Yeah the code worked good for me. Allowed me to change my default video player and such. Totem doesn't like to play some DvDs, so I changed the default to VLC.
2008-11-10T03:32:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	If I only change the x-content/audio-player part it still uses Rythmbox...
2008-11-10T03:34:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	Only one, I'll try all three
2008-11-10T03:35:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	Alright, hope that does it. If not, go ahead and change them back if you like, and maybe someone else will be able to help.
2008-11-10T03:35:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	Ya, it didn't. I'll google moar.
2008-11-10T03:35:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	:( I'm sorry I couldn't help.
2008-11-10T03:36:00.000Z	NekroJakub	Bowtrik	Don't feel bad about it. Oh, you can tell me how to make my multimedia keyboard keys work if you know...
2008-11-10T03:36:00.000Z	Bowtrik	NekroJakub	Not exactly. :D Sorry!
