2010-01-06T16:53:00.000Z	nelson8874		hello everybody
2010-01-06T16:54:00.000Z	nelson8874		i'm very noob, so i have a very noob question
2010-01-06T16:54:00.000Z	nelson8874		i've downloaded a program and it is a tar.gz file. what do i do with this?
2010-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	nelson8874		doe
2010-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	nelson8874		done
2010-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	read the readme file
2010-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	hmm. if you don't mind, link where you got it from - all references i can find are for a windows app
2010-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	ok

2010-01-06T17:00:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	ok, we can be semi sute it'll work.. so..  read the readme - make sure the prerequisites it mentions are installed. then
2010-01-06T17:01:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	./configure first - if it works, then 'make', then either sudo make install, or sudo checkinstall - the latter needs the checkinstall package but it makes a package instead of installing, which is easier later
2010-01-06T17:02:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	i'm noob, i do not understand what you're saying. And english is not my first language...
2010-01-06T17:03:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	ok. you have extracted the archive. there should be a readme file there. it should tell you what other packages you need.
2010-01-06T17:03:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	are you're saying i should configure it? what does that mean?
2010-01-06T17:03:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	ok packages...
2010-01-06T17:04:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	its a command. ./configure basically checks to see if you have everything you need, and tells you if anything is missing.
2010-01-06T17:05:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	if it works, go on to using the command 'make' . if that works 'make install' puts everything where it should be. checkinstall is an optional package that makes a deb instead of installing it- i prefer this approach since i can add and remove self compiled apps with apt or dpkg
2010-01-06T17:06:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	installing that program is complicated, i've tried another one, instaled with no proble,  but it says "You can not access the partitions because the user who launched wiithon not belong to the group "disk"." Showing the games of the last session.
2010-01-06T17:06:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	hmm- that's fixable - you add yourself to the group
2010-01-06T17:07:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	how??
2010-01-06T17:08:00.000Z	nelson8874	faileas	damn, that is the hard part of linux, instaling things is almost everytime a dificult task
2010-01-06T17:08:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	'sudo usermod -g disk username' should work for the latter
2010-01-06T17:08:00.000Z	faileas	nelson8874	it gets easier with experience
