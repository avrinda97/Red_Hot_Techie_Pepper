2005-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	concept10		Why does synaptic and apt keep reminding me: Warning: The following packages cannot be authenticated!  whats up with people not sigining these packages?
2005-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	are they ubuntu (main, restricted, uni- or multiverse) packages ?
2005-06-18T13:38:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	Im not sure yet.  Im trying to get a understanding of Ubuntu's repositories
2005-06-18T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	the ubuntu packages *should* all be signed, afaik
2005-06-18T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	possibly. i'm not sure
2005-06-23T12:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	do you want dpkg -l ?
2005-06-23T12:22:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	does that check to see if a package is installed?
2005-06-23T12:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	not clear what your question is about... what are you trying to do?
2005-06-23T12:34:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	im about to compile a kernel, I was curious what linux-headers are
2005-06-23T12:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	there's a linux-headers package which is needed for compiling kernel modules corresponding to a particular ubuntu kernel image
2005-06-23T12:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	it include C header files (.h files) and kernel config information
2005-06-27T14:23:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	you almost sounded like a microsoft commercial
2005-06-27T14:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	assimilation is inevitable
2005-07-25T13:48:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	remove the quotation marks from that
2005-07-25T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	yessir
2005-07-25T13:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	thinkcspy is good for beginner programmers
2005-07-25T13:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/    --- imo diveintopython is for those who've done a bit of coding before
2005-07-25T13:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	also, try #python on this server
2005-07-28T08:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	maybe do 'pkill gnome-panel' and try again
2005-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	any more suggestions? that doesnt work?
2005-07-28T08:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	hmm. other that logout and login, no
2005-07-28T08:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	does 'pgrep gnome-panel' show anything ?
2005-07-28T08:49:00.000Z	concept10	HappyFool	after killing the panel 5 times it went away. Confused on panel activity, I am.
2005-08-27T13:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	concept10	try maybe 'sudo lshw' or 'sudo lshal', or look in /proc/ide or /proc/scsi
