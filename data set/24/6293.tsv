2005-11-22T11:45:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	but it says Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
2005-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	so you should bang on the keyboard, listen to music, move the mouse around, etc.
2005-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	I do that like crazy, but same message
2005-11-22T11:50:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	It worked now I banged the kb like it was insane
2005-11-22T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	that's Seveas.

2005-11-28T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	...no
2005-11-28T12:37:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	do you have a solution to getting a system running again that has had its /home deleted?
2005-11-28T12:38:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	a sane system does not depend on anything in /home
2005-11-28T12:40:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	it wont boot, it says /home is missing!  any sol,ution or we need to reinstall Ubuntu?
2005-11-28T12:40:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	what was in /home that it depends on?
2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	no idea, all i know Ubuntu wont load now, says something about /home
2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	any solutions?
2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	the /home was deleted.
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	the cause was that whole /home was deleted :P lol
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	and now wont load. any ideas why?
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	lightbright	not having a /home doesn't prevent Ubuntu from loading by default
2005-11-28T12:44:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	well thats weird then for it wont load
2005-11-28T12:44:00.000Z	lightbright	crimsun	ok ill get it reinstalled
