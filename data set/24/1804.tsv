2009-08-21T01:26:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	found some of the newer releases to need bit more resources
2009-08-21T01:27:00.000Z	Ben64	thefamousnomo	they shouldn't, unless you have effects on or something
2009-08-21T01:27:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	my son has a 7.10 install that he loves but i had trouble even booting 8.10
2009-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	now cant install anything for it, gutsy
2009-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	Ben64	thefamousnomo	yeah, the lts last for 3 or 5 years, other ones a lot less
2009-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	anyway, support was sposed to have stopped, but its not... :) not complainin
2009-08-21T01:29:00.000Z	Ben64	thefamousnomo	oh but it will, and then everything will suck
2009-08-21T01:29:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	yep, prefer the lts myself
2009-08-21T01:29:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	yes, worried bout that :)
2009-08-21T01:30:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	tbh, found Tinycore for my old compaq n400c, runs like a dream, prob will move to that and leave ubuntu to the desktops
2009-08-21T01:30:00.000Z	Ben64	thefamousnomo	you ever try xubuntu? works great on slow systems
2009-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	had that running on an old thinkpad but the sound was a NIGHTMARE!
2009-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	c6334 or some such issues...
2009-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	the cirrus nightmare
2009-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	Ben64	thefamousnomo	it's the same as ubuntu, just different window manager
2009-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	thefamousnomo	Ben64	yep, sure it was 8.04 had used, but the thinkpad struggled even with xfce...
