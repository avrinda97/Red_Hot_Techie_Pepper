2007-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	berent		is there any tool in ubuntu which can be used to create a audiovisual flash animation using the storyboard pictures i have
2007-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	afief	berent	as far as I know there is no program to author flash animations, but there is a program called synergy that can do some great things very similar to Flash(and it uses the storyboard concept)
2007-10-11T16:59:00.000Z	berent	afief	: by storyboards you mean in what format ? i mean does it need to have an extension
2007-10-11T05:00:00.000Z	afief	berent	I do not know exactly, I only read up on the tutorials a bit, but never actually used the software
2007-10-11T05:07:00.000Z	afief	berent	sorry I got the wrong package name, this is the one I meant: http://www.synfig.com/
2007-10-11T05:07:00.000Z	berent	afief	: i was lost :-) thanks
2007-10-11T05:09:00.000Z	afief	berent	please don't forget to show us your work when you're done(upload it to youtube "free software animation" or something:D)
2007-10-11T05:09:00.000Z	berent	afief	: sure ,if it helps.
2007-10-11T05:10:00.000Z	afief	berent	sudo apt-get install synfig works though:)
2007-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	afief	berent	anything you can show us already?
2007-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	berent	afief	: installing it ; but it says its  "vector-based 2D animation package" - wonder if its same as blender!!
2007-10-11T05:15:00.000Z	afief	berent	nah blender is 3d animation/modelling/rendering. although I love blender
2007-10-11T05:16:00.000Z	afief	berent	I mean the storyboard and stuff, would be nice to have a sneakpeak
2007-10-11T05:20:00.000Z	berent	afief	: it needs a SIF file. dont know what it is!! Also came by this -http://youmakemedia.com/2007/02/14/celtx-releases-099/
2007-10-11T05:22:00.000Z	berent	afief	: there is one more synfigstudio which has GUI . Let me find it helps
2007-10-11T05:22:00.000Z	afief	berent	oh you were using the command line version? I can't imagine someone doing animation there:D
2007-10-11T05:23:00.000Z	berent	afief	: :-P
2007-10-11T05:24:00.000Z	afief	berent	you should try animating in C or assembly:-P
2007-10-11T05:24:00.000Z	berent	afief	: yeah. Fortran not a bad choice
2007-10-11T05:25:00.000Z	afief	berent	cobol is also a choice
2007-10-11T05:26:00.000Z	afief	berent	this looks quite nice http://www.synfig.com//screenshots/screenshot.png
2007-10-11T05:27:00.000Z	afief	berent	weird, perhaps you should report a bug and/or try to compile the latest version yourself
2007-10-11T05:27:00.000Z	afief	berent	joining #synfig is also good:)
2007-10-11T05:27:00.000Z	berent	afief	: right
