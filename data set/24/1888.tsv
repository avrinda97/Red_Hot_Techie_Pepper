2009-07-13T14:44:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		How do I set it so that network shares and mounted devices do not get shown on my desktop?
2009-07-13T14:45:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	you can mount them in /mnt and they won't show on the desktop
2009-07-13T14:45:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	either mount them at /mnt or make directories in /mnt
2009-07-13T14:46:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		Why does /mnt make the difference - It's an easy solution, just curious...
2009-07-13T14:47:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		But what if it's a networked drive - how do i mount drives in /mnt then?
2009-07-13T14:48:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		Eh, it's really not much of an issue, actually a few less keystrokes...was just curious. =]
2009-07-13T14:48:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	 you can still mount network drives in /mnt
2009-07-13T14:48:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	what kind of network drive is it? ... i'm going to make sure you get helped!
2009-07-13T14:49:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		so i could edit /etc/fstab or is there a way to mount it via terminal smbmount?
2009-07-13T14:49:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		external maxtor on an ubuntu server.
2009-07-13T14:49:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	you can mount via terminal... use /hostname/sharedfolder i believe
2009-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	your server's running ubuntu? Then why not use NFS instead of Samba?
2009-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_	Okay	well then how would I mount it via NFS?
2009-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		I've only used samba.
2009-07-13T14:50:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		same way I'd suppose.
2009-07-13T14:51:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	samba is horrible for nautilus.. (more like nautilus just acts up with samba)
2009-07-13T14:51:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	basically, you need to edit the /etc/exports file on your server and export the paths you want to share over the network
2009-07-13T14:51:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		heh. Im all for easier solutions.
2009-07-13T14:52:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	there are some great guides and examples if you look on google
2009-07-13T14:52:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		/etc/exports is a new file though >_>
2009-07-13T14:52:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	really? does your server have nfs installed?
2009-07-13T14:52:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		that's what I was just about to check xD
2009-07-13T14:53:00.000Z	rootlinuxusr_		It might not.
2009-07-13T14:53:00.000Z	moymoy	rootlinuxusr_	sudo aptitude install nfs-server nfs-kernel-server
