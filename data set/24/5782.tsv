2006-09-28T15:37:00.000Z	alleyoopster		I am looking for a little help finding a dependency for rubyripper. It is libfreedb-ruby. Anyone know where I can get this from? thanks
2006-09-28T15:37:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	you could try search here http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2006-09-28T15:39:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	yeah tried there, also tried rarewares and google and hydrogen
2006-09-28T15:40:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	if there aint any ubuntu package for it, you may have to compile it your self...
2006-09-28T15:41:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	consult the manual of the software you want to use (or their chat/list/forum)
2006-09-28T15:41:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	yeah, I have, it is listed as a dependency, but no more info. I'll try posting on there forum. Thanks for your input
2006-09-28T15:42:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	what package are you installing and from where ?
2006-09-28T15:43:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1284&release_id=6293
2006-09-28T15:43:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	one sec I'll find the deb for it
2006-09-28T15:43:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	well, thats not from ubuntu repository, so your on your own...
2006-09-28T15:44:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	the deb is http://www.rarewares.org/debian/packages/unstable/rubyripper_0.2-0rarewares1_i386.deb
2006-09-28T15:45:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	hmm, thats for debian ?
2006-09-28T15:45:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	yes it is
2006-09-28T15:45:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	and your using ubuntu ?
2006-09-28T15:45:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	yes I am
2006-09-28T15:45:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	so you know that wont (mostly) work
2006-09-28T15:46:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	well mostly debian files will work, ubuntu is based on debian after all
2006-09-28T15:46:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	ubuntu != dapper, but ubuntu is based on debian...
2006-09-28T15:46:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	there are many distros based on debian... still they may have different libraray versions = wont work
2006-09-28T15:47:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	as you saw, it wants a library thats not in ubuntu, got it ?
2006-09-28T15:47:00.000Z	alleyoopster	oskude	I have installed many packages that are deb and they do work just fine, some don't but mostly they work
2006-09-28T15:47:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	well, then you had luck
2006-09-28T15:52:00.000Z	oskude	alleyoopster	and please look that its for your flavor of ubuntu (hoary/dapper) too
