2005-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		is there an application (graphic) that you can make on ISO-file with?
2005-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		maybe gnomebaker/graveman?
2005-05-18T16:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	Go to the CD/DVD Creator in nautilus, drag and drop the files you want on the CD, and choose to burn it
2005-05-18T16:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	choose file image
2005-05-18T16:46:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	what if I don't use nautilus :-\ (XFCE)
2005-05-18T16:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	gnomebaker? :)
2005-05-18T16:47:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	ok, thanks, I'll look (more deeply :-p) to those programs
2005-06-06T15:14:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	what was the prob?
2005-06-06T15:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	Besides the fact that shipping Java and w32codecs is blatant copyright infringement?
2005-06-06T15:15:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	I ask because I don't know :-|
2005-06-06T15:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	You didn't know that distributing windows dlls files was illegal? :)
2005-06-06T15:16:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	I didn't know w32codecs include windows dlls
2005-06-06T15:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	thus the w32 :)
2005-06-06T10:12:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	ooh, aah, XFCE support, how well it handles that?
2005-06-06T10:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	Well, as long as XFCE complies with the menu spec the only problem you might have is smeg showing the wrong icons for things you haven't editted.
2005-06-06T11:13:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	maybe he's just limber
2005-06-07T10:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	What's up?
2005-06-07T10:15:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	might be just a misunderstanding
2005-06-08T14:53:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	what bot is it?
2005-06-08T14:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	blootbot, i think
2005-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	my screen is upside down
2005-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	http://www.realistanew.com/screwed.png :D
2005-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Amaranth	well me how to do it
2005-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	Fator_Dee	gimped, but there is a way of doing it, they do it for tablet pc/laptop hybrids
