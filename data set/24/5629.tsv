2006-06-06T08:26:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	I'm using it
2006-06-06T08:27:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	does it also crash a LOT (or strange behaviour sometimes)?
2006-06-06T08:27:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	form dapper repos?
2006-06-06T08:28:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	what does happen, when you minimize a window?
2006-06-06T08:28:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	it zooms down in a funky way, doesn't seem to have any problem
2006-06-06T08:29:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	zooms down to the bar? For me, it simply disappears? i don't know where!?
2006-06-06T08:30:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	does it show up on alt-tab?
2006-06-06T08:30:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	not every time
2006-06-06T08:30:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	 when you minimize, where does the window go TO ?
2006-06-06T08:32:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	 when you minimize, where does the window go to?
2006-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	hmm, it does not work for me !? Also sometimes a little window pops out where i can some windows in it, do you have the same?
2006-06-06T08:34:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	don't think so, haven't had anything that fits that description
2006-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	which graphic card do you use?
2006-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	got a geforce fx5700le
2006-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	running the nvidia-glx drivers too, if that's relevant
2006-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	aha nivia, ok, that explains everything :-) fit DOES WORK correctly... for ati it's not the case
2006-06-06T08:38:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	presume you're ati then?
2006-06-06T08:39:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	guessed right :-) and i'm NOT satisfied :-(
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	I had an ati card before... switched to nvidia mainly for linux compatibility... seems like it paid off
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	i got their drivers working, even high FPS, BUT a LOT of bugs and incompabilities
2006-06-06T08:40:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	not much you can do about that, I guess... hope you don't have too many problems in future
2006-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	g-nome	tr00st	how do you configure you compiz? via gconf-tools?
2006-06-06T08:41:00.000Z	tr00st	g-nome	indeed
