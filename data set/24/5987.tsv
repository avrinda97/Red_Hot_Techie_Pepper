2010-03-23T20:27:00.000Z	hal		I am trying to follow these instructions to install an alternative version of wine   http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2009/08/making-wine-sound-work-with-pulseaudio.html
2010-03-23T20:27:00.000Z	hal		hmm, hold that thought... :)
2010-03-23T20:28:00.000Z	hal		ok, I have installed the ppa key and the source, but I am not sure how to install the sofware package from this source rather than the default ubuntu repo.
2010-03-23T20:28:00.000Z	hal		would someone help me through this please?
2010-03-23T20:29:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	generally, it would pick up the package from ppa (as it is newer). Else go to properties in synaptic, for the package, and see what versions are available
2010-03-23T20:29:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	and then in synaptic, choose package->force versopm
2010-03-23T20:30:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	but I doubt all that would be required
2010-03-23T20:30:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	hi
2010-03-23T20:30:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	 ok. I have synaptic open, and only see one package for wine
2010-03-23T20:31:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	I mean only see one version
2010-03-23T20:31:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	hold on .. I am looking at the link you shared
2010-03-23T20:32:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	oh, I am sorry, you are right, there is only one wine1.2
2010-03-23T20:32:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	just install the wine1.2 then
2010-03-23T20:33:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	thanks, yes, that was a bit of a silly question, wasn't it? :-/  Sorry
2010-03-23T20:33:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	no issues :)
2010-03-23T20:42:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	create a shortcut . or from terminal / run (alt-f2) : wine <path>
2010-03-23T20:43:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	sorry, how do I create a shortcut?
2010-03-23T20:44:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	first try from command line. if it works, then right click on desktop, and create launcer
2010-03-23T20:45:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	ah, actually since you said that it prompted me to right click on the exe file, and there is a Make Link option
2010-03-23T20:45:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	I just didn't imagine that would be possible before.  Thank you!
2010-03-23T20:45:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	btw, I just cut and pasted the link onto the desktop
2010-03-23T20:45:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	did it work ?
2010-03-23T20:46:00.000Z	hal	abhinav	yes, it did :)
2010-03-23T20:46:00.000Z	abhinav	hal	cool :)
