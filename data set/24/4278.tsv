2007-07-07T06:41:00.000Z	aroo	kbrooks	i don't want any inf, you need to say which card you have, what you have tried, what you have changed, anything that helps me help you
2007-07-07T06:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	okay, i have not changed anything iirc, only installed bcm43xx-fwcutter and rebooted
2007-07-07T06:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	i answered yes to the question and it downloaded firmware from the internet thru my ethernet connection which i had plugged in at the time
2007-07-07T06:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	then i went to bed, shutting down. on start again, it does not connect at all. however...
2007-07-07T06:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	there is a wifi combination. i checked in the bios and that combination is turned on. so, i start over again, and then i see my wifi light
2007-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	it works up until GNOME starts again.
2007-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	aroo	kbrooks	how can you tell it works before gnome?
2007-07-07T06:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	the combination turns off and on the wifi
2007-07-07T06:48:00.000Z	aroo	kbrooks	what is bcm43xx-fwcutter anyway?
2007-07-07T06:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	^^^^
2007-07-07T06:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	i have a bcm43xx card
2007-07-07T06:49:00.000Z	aroo	kbrooks	I only have experience with ndiswrapper for wireless cards
2007-07-07T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	it was easy to install wireless, but i am not talking about that.
2007-07-07T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	i am talking about the general use after shutdown and reboot.
2007-07-07T06:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	aroo	ping
2007-07-07T06:51:00.000Z	aroo	kbrooks	I am just judging your problem based on the last thing you did that changed things, which was installing that firmware hack
