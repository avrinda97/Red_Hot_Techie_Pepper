2006-10-08T11:13:00.000Z	mistershooby		hi can someone help me out with a problem I'm having
2006-10-08T11:13:00.000Z	mistershooby		when I run easyubuntu, I get the following error
2006-10-08T11:13:00.000Z	mistershooby		W: GPG error: http://packages.freecontrib.org dapper Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F120156012B83718
2006-10-08T11:14:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	looks like one of the repos it adds needs a gpg authentication key and they didn't put it in the easyubuntu program/script/whatever it is.
2006-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	what are you trying to do with easyubuntu, perhaps I could tell you how to do it in another way or someone else
2006-10-08T11:17:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	use this guide here to enable the extra repos, once you enable the extra repos, open a terminal Applications>Accessories>Terminal and copy this in "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2006-10-08T11:20:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	the linux flash blog seems to indicate a beta might come out soon, I dont think the official one is slated until 07
2006-10-08T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	it should work on youtube, some sites require 8 or 9
2006-10-08T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	put this in the addressbar of firefox "about:plugins"
2006-10-08T11:22:00.000Z	mistershooby	bruenig	"no plugins are installed"
2006-10-08T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	all installed with flashplugin-nonfree?
2006-10-08T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	go to the terminal and do ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2006-10-08T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	when you do ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins, what is the output?
2006-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	mistershooby	bruenig	libunixprintplugin.so
2006-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	you should have flashplayer.xpt and libflashplayer.so if you installed flashplugin-nonfree
2006-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	mistershooby	bruenig	well I just reinstalled
2006-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	it is pretty easy to do it manually
2006-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	save this to the desktop or the home folder or wherever you want http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_7_linux.tar.gz
2006-10-08T11:30:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	when you get that done, indicate as much
2006-10-08T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	open a terminal and cd into it. Do cd ~/Desktop/installinstall_flash_player_7_linux
2006-10-08T11:31:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	then do "sudo mv sudo mv flashplayer.xpt libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
2006-10-08T11:32:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	the cd command was wrong should have been cd ~/Desktop/install_flash_player_7_linux
2006-10-08T11:33:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	ah now you play the flashplugin sucks and doesn't work right game, have fun
2006-10-08T11:34:00.000Z	bruenig	mistershooby	one solution is to close the browser and making sure any application that makes sound is closed and then restart the browser and try again
