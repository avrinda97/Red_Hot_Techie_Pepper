2009-04-27T09:06:00.000Z	sdtr443w		what can I do if xorg locks up on starting up and an xfix doesn't solve it?
2009-04-27T09:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Boot into recovery mode, go to root shell and edit your xorg.conf to use the "vesa" driver to get a basic driver going
2009-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	What exactly does it prompt for ( and if you misspell my name I won't notice your replies, try typing the first few letters then hitting tab )
2009-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	I have to paraphrase since I'm running off the recovery CD right now.  When I select NETBOOT it prompts for the administrator password in a black text-mode console
2009-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	I typed up a new xorg.conf but I don't have much faith in it; I've had bad luck getting my widescreen LCD to work w/o an accelerated driver in the past.
2009-04-27T09:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Why are you choosing "NETBOOT" and what recovery CD? You should be using the "recovery mode" option from the grub menu
2009-04-27T09:19:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	I'm currently in the 9.04 recovery CD.  When doing netboot I was using the recovery mode grub option on my normal installation.
2009-04-27T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	The recovery mode option shouldn't say anything about netboot IIRC
2009-04-27T09:20:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	Basically anything off the recovery mode option that tried to go to a shell would ask for my root password.
2009-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	That's odd, is this a fairly standard install?
2009-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	might be netroot--it's the one that would take somebody into what would normally be init 3 on another OS.
2009-04-27T09:22:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	I upgraded from 8.10 to 9.04.  It was being a good boy until I tried to install the ATI 9.3 drivers when I should have done 9.4.  Now it locks up going into X and it snubs me trying to do any console recover stuff.
2009-04-27T09:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Ok, what is this recovery CD you were talking about?
2009-04-27T09:23:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	A 9.04 LiveCD
2009-04-27T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Do you know what a chroot is?
2009-04-27T09:25:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	chroot doesn't seem to work.  I think the LiveCD is 32-bit but my OS is 64-bit.  So I get into trouble when it tries to run bash.
2009-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	About the only thing I can think of is trying this hacked up xorg.conf.  Problem is that it takes me about 10 minutes to boot back in to here with IRC if it doesn't work.
2009-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Ok, can you just edit your xorg.conf and add: Driver "vesa"       To your device section?
2009-04-27T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	pastebin the xorg.conf
2009-04-27T09:27:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	Yes that seems to be about all I can do.  Re: pastebin--hold on
2009-04-27T09:28:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu.com/159029/
2009-04-27T09:32:00.000Z	sdtr443w	Jordan_U	Ah well I'm going to try booting into that xorg.conf.  I won't see anything for 10 minutes or so if I have to boot back off the liveCD.
2009-04-27T09:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Get rid of the "1920x1200" You are never going to get that with vesa, in fact let me make you a minimal vesa config
2009-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sdtr443w	Here is a minimal xorg.conf with the driver set to vesa: http://pastebin.com/fc2a94e6
