2008-08-01T06:39:00.000Z	Bogus8		why is it that what I fit on a 441gig raid 5 partition (ext3 on debian etchy) won't fit on my new ubuntu system with a 463g raid 5 partition (ext3)?
2008-08-01T06:39:00.000Z	Bogus8		and I had 4% free on the old (441gig) drive
2008-08-01T06:40:00.000Z	Bogus8		only 400gigs used
2008-08-01T06:40:00.000Z	Bogus8		but it's taking up 439gigs when I rsync it over to the new system
2008-08-01T06:40:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	Because more than 4% is reserved on the filesystem for superuser
2008-08-01T06:40:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	ok, but why would it fit on one system and not another?
2008-08-01T06:41:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	See my previous answer
2008-08-01T06:41:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	so ubuntu is different in that case?
2008-08-01T06:41:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	400gigs of data is now taking up 439 gigs when I rsyned it over to ubuntu
2008-08-01T06:42:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	measuring all this apples to apples (df -h to df -h)
2008-09-25T09:15:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	reiser4progs
2008-09-25T09:16:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	I think that allows you to create the filesystem but not mount  it
2008-09-25T09:16:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	reiserfsprogs as well
2008-09-25T09:17:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	"This package contains utilities to create, check, resize, and debug ReiserFS filesystems."
2008-09-25T09:20:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	Did you also install kernel-patch-2.6-reiser4 ?
2008-09-25T09:20:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	I can't find that package anywhere
2008-09-25T09:25:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	On my box the reiserfs kernel module seems to have been built into the initram and it works to mount without needing to specify -t fstype.
2008-09-25T09:25:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	rieser4? or just rieser?
2008-09-25T09:26:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	I don't have any reiser4 systems yet, just reiser, so can't test right now
2008-09-25T09:26:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	right, reiser3 works fine... but you can't mount reiser4, just create the file systems... real usefull *rolleyes*
2008-09-25T09:29:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	Have you tried something as obvious as perhaps sudo mount -t reiser4 /dev/<whatever reiser4progs formatted drive> /mountpoint          ?
2008-09-25T09:42:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	Sorry, stepped out for a second... yes I've tried that... it doesn't know that file type
2008-09-25T09:45:00.000Z	genii	Bogus8	There seems something interesting on the whole subject here http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=11926&sid=8854c4b61836037d8c87cf210fef1018
2008-09-25T09:47:00.000Z	Bogus8	genii	yeah, I was hoping to keep my ubuntu kernel.. maybe just patch it... don't really care to start with a generic kernel :(
