2010-09-26T03:56:00.000Z	Dmitriy		guys question for you all
2010-09-26T03:57:00.000Z	Dmitriy		has anyone downloaded a file on ubuntu and then saw on windows that it was 0kb?
2010-09-26T03:57:00.000Z	Dmitriy		any suggestions?
2010-09-26T03:57:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna	Dmitriy	you may have saved it to the wrong location? what was the file called
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	Dmitriy		external hard drive
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	Dmitriy		ntfs
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna	Dmitriy	was it saved to a location that windows could recognise before you were running linux?
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	Dmitriy		yes
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna		because linux can read NTFS and just popped a file on there
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna		thats it then
2010-09-26T03:58:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna		saved in wrong location
2010-09-26T03:59:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna		windows can see it too, thats it :) just delete it if it bothers you
2010-09-26T03:59:00.000Z	Dmitriy		it works fine sometimes
2010-09-26T03:59:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna	Dmitriy	you say it was 0kb, what was it meant to be?
2010-09-26T03:59:00.000Z	Dmitriy		an mkv
2010-09-26T04:00:00.000Z	Dmitriy		i always fully download a file
2010-09-26T04:00:00.000Z	Dmitriy		works fine with ubuntu
2010-09-26T04:00:00.000Z	Dmitriy		full file size
2010-09-26T04:00:00.000Z	Dmitriy		windows acts up
2010-09-26T04:00:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna		what are you trying to open the .mkv with

2010-09-26T04:01:00.000Z	cellardoor-jorna	Dmitriy	odd, would it be any trouble to re-download and just try again?
