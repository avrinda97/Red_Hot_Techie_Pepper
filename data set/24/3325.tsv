2008-05-12T23:01:00.000Z	gltar		hello... im having problems with gdm and user switch... can some one help me?
2008-05-12T23:02:00.000Z	gltar		when i close sesion with one user for some reason it doesnt go back to gdm, it asks the password of the other user
2008-05-12T23:02:00.000Z	gltar		how can i solve this?
2008-05-12T23:03:00.000Z	gltar		no one?
2008-05-12T23:04:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	it does that automaticly
2008-05-12T23:04:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	use switch_user
2008-05-12T23:06:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	that happens becuz u used switch user at the first place
2008-05-12T23:07:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	if u completely log out the first user before u log in with the second one, it wont happen
2008-05-12T23:08:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	how come it's all blocked?
2008-05-12T23:11:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	ok i c what u r talkin about
2008-05-12T23:13:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	ok i just tried that
2008-05-12T23:13:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	i switched user1 to user2, then logout user2
2008-05-12T23:13:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	and then it ask me to enter the password for user1
2008-05-12T23:14:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	but there is a button for switch user
2008-05-12T23:14:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	just press that button and u r back to gdm
2008-05-12T23:15:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	really? ok a sec
2008-05-12T23:16:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	it works here
2008-05-12T23:16:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	i guess so, but i really don't know how
2008-05-12T23:17:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	u proably should take a look at the logout script
2008-05-12T23:18:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	na.. english is not my first language neither
2008-05-12T23:18:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	i will try
2008-05-12T23:18:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	na, chinese
2008-05-12T23:25:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	hum..
2008-05-12T23:25:00.000Z	[Hardy]TuTUXG	gltar	i think the switch user button should work
