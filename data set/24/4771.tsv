2007-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	I know :)
2007-10-25T04:36:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	correct.
2007-10-25T04:36:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	make sure you are hitting all the repos
2007-10-25T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	I am
2007-10-25T04:51:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	try chaning your mirris
2007-10-25T04:51:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	mirrors rather
2008-11-21T06:18:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	No, actually, its not. Following the documented upgrade procedures (do-release-upgrade or update-manager) is the proper way to upgrade to a new release.
2008-11-21T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	Re-read what I said, that's what I was telling him :)
2008-11-21T06:19:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	sorry, missed a key word in there :)
2009-11-04T01:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	Is there a way to make gnome-terminal use pspkr again?
2009-11-04T01:30:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	I think just enabling the pcspkr module and changing the system bell option in your gnome-terminal preferences should do it.
2009-11-04T01:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	I have pcspkr, and "beep" uses it just fine but gnome-terminal is still just playing a sound through pulse
2010-06-29T23:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	Yes, Ubuntu is just a huge set of interchangeable packages. Anything is possible.
2010-06-29T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	I'm aware.
2010-06-29T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	:D
2010-09-16T04:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	No, you should still be able to recover from running out of space because /root isn't in /home.
2010-09-16T04:24:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	Thats what I thought, wanted to double check though.  Thanks.  (5% is alot when dealing with large partition sizes)
2010-09-16T04:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	You're welcome.
2010-10-14T23:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	*testing
2010-10-14T23:05:00.000Z	Pici	Jordan_U	er, right,
2011-02-24T00:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Pici	vimtutor is good for learning vim.
