2011-05-16T06:43:00.000Z	unforgiven512		Is there any way I can determine what caused my system to crash (hard lock)?
2011-05-16T06:43:00.000Z	devnull_	unforgiven512	the log files
2011-05-16T06:44:00.000Z	unforgiven512	devnull_	which ones, specifically? I glanced through them, could not find anything useful.
2011-05-16T06:45:00.000Z	devnull_		messages
2011-05-16T06:45:00.000Z	devnull_		if the kernel crashed it might have left a dump
2011-05-16T06:45:00.000Z	devnull_		it is kind of hard to track stuff down ... you have to go back to when the crash happened and see what the last few messages were
2011-05-16T06:46:00.000Z	devnull_		ugg
2011-05-16T06:48:00.000Z	devnull_		idk ... bios upgrade ... ripping out my usb drives from my lappy ... kernel upgrade ? i have no idea any more
