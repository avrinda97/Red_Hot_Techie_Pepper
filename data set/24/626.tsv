2011-06-27T23:06:00.000Z	xmd		just comes up Error: file not found grub rescue>
2011-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	xmd		error: file not found grub rescue>?
2011-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	escott	xmd	do you know what drive the bootloader was installed to?
2011-06-27T23:11:00.000Z	escott	xmd	it contains multiple methods
2011-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	xmd	escott	im just in awe, why do i not already have grub2?
2011-06-27T23:12:00.000Z	escott	xmd	sounds like what happended was grub was installed to the mbr of the drive physically in the machine but is looking for the usb, ever time you boot the usb appears in a different spot
2011-06-27T23:13:00.000Z	xmd	escott	there is no drive physically in the machine?
2011-06-27T23:13:00.000Z	escott	xmd	so you need to follow the "lost grub after installing windows" instructions to put grub onto the usb drive
2011-06-27T23:15:00.000Z	escott	xmd	the install you are describing is a bit unusual im pretty sure it couldn't figure out the right drive. boot the live usb
2011-06-27T23:16:00.000Z	escott	xmd	then figure out what /dev/sdX is the external harddrive, then use the chroot instructions in !grub to run grub-install /dev/sdX
2011-06-27T23:16:00.000Z	escott	xmd	ubuntu live
2011-06-27T23:17:00.000Z	escott	xmd	then follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot to chroot yourself into the external drive
2011-06-27T23:17:00.000Z	escott	xmd	use the disk utility
2011-06-27T23:18:00.000Z	escott	xmd	no there is a gui tool called disk utility which tells about the disks (im assuming its on the live cd)
2011-06-27T23:18:00.000Z	escott	xmd	you could also use gparted
2011-06-27T23:20:00.000Z	xmd	escott	im following the directions in the link
2011-06-27T23:20:00.000Z	escott	xmd	find your external drive and then on the right below the "Volumes" it should say what device it is.
2011-06-27T23:21:00.000Z	xmd	escott	can i private chat you for a sec?
2011-06-27T23:22:00.000Z	xmd	escott	I am following the directions in the link, I also have the Disk Utility, the directions in the link become compliated after step 4
