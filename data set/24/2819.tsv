2008-08-25T01:57:00.000Z	stryd_one		i'm reading that you shouldn't use dpkg to install deb files because it doesn't take care of dependencies... what can i use?
2008-08-25T01:57:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	gdebi
2008-08-25T02:05:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	gdebi should have a CLI version, or... thats the impression I was under.
2008-08-25T02:06:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	or rather, gdebi should work from the CLI.
2008-08-25T02:07:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	In fact, yes, it does.  If you don't have it installed (because you have no GUI), install gdebi-core
2008-08-25T02:11:00.000Z	stryd_one	Flannel	thanks, trying it now
2008-08-25T02:18:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	yeah, but only with a few depends
2008-08-25T02:20:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	well, most people just apt-get it.  Why can't you?
2008-08-25T02:21:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	on top of that, most (if not all
2008-08-25T02:21:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	(if not all) of the depends of gdebi are a part of ubuntu-standard and/or ubuntu-minimal
2008-08-25T02:23:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	apt-get grabs them from http (and ftp)
2008-08-25T02:25:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	no... it does.  but so does gdebi.  gdebi takes local packages (I just downloaded this deb want want to install it) and satisfies their deps from the http repos (the deb I downloaded has depends, and I don't want to figure them out manually)
2008-08-25T02:25:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	What are you trying to do?
2008-08-25T02:26:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	You trying to install a bunch of files via sneakernet?
2008-08-25T02:27:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	are they deb packages?
2008-08-25T02:27:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	and, will these other systems be connected to the internet?
2008-08-25T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	gdebi will work fine then, and is installed by default on systems.
2008-08-25T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	CD repos count as real repos, so gdebi will be able to resolve deps with those too.
2008-08-25T02:29:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	you ... might be interested with aptonCD if you want to create a repo CD with your special packages (they pop it in, and then install through package management)
2008-08-25T02:30:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	No, disallowing that is a feature of the apt:// handler (its a security risk).  but wget and gdebi will work fine.
2008-08-25T02:31:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	You could put those debs in your PPA (with permission, of course) and then add your PPA to the repos list
2008-08-25T02:31:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	You can't.
2008-08-25T02:32:00.000Z	stryd_one	Flannel	one last (i think) question: is there a 'correct' place to save the debs i download?
2008-08-25T02:33:00.000Z	Flannel	stryd_one	Not really, no.  apt has a place, but thats just for stuff in the repos.  I imagine you'll be deleting them aftwards anyway
