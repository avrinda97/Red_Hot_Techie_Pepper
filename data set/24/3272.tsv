2010-02-06T15:33:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	this might be your problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1264151&highlight=grub+invalid+signature&page=2
2010-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	you could try pastebinning your grub.conf and "fdisk -l" output
2010-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	a minute
2010-02-06T15:39:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	grub.cfg http://pastebin.com/m5e878820
2010-02-06T15:40:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	i think there's a problem with hd0 and hd1 but i don't know how to change it
2010-02-06T15:41:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	also "fdisk -l" and "/etc/default/grub"
2010-02-06T15:42:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	sudo fdisk -l

2010-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	do you have windows 7 on sda (hd0) or sdb (hd1)?
2010-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	sda in fact but there's always a problem with it
2010-02-06T15:48:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	do these: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Dual-booting
2010-02-06T15:57:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	doesn't work. win7 is in the boot menu but doesn't boot. I had a problem while installing windows partion was for example on hd0 but then in ubuntu it became hd1. It's easy to fix in grub but not in grub2. so that's the problem
2010-02-06T15:57:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	you did osprobe?
2010-02-06T15:58:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	i did
2010-02-06T15:59:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	and ubuntu works fine?
2010-02-06T15:59:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	oh yeah, ubuntu works, did you mean why do i want win7? :D
2010-02-06T16:00:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	no, just curious that grub2 doesn't work just for 7
2010-02-06T16:00:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	but grub worked great, should i downgrade grub?
2010-02-06T16:01:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	it looks like it's pointing to the right place if 7 is on sda. i guess you could try downgrading
2010-02-06T16:01:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	how to change sda to sdb in grub2?
2010-02-06T16:03:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	try this: http://erickoo.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/how-to-add-vista-partition-to-grub-2-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala/
2010-02-06T16:04:00.000Z	chelz	freeride	only have:    set root=(hd0,2)
2010-02-06T16:05:00.000Z	freeride	chelz	thanks a lot, man. I'll try do my self. Thanks for great help ))
