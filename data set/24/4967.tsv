2007-01-07T06:22:00.000Z	riotkittie		why is cat 5 better than usb ?
2007-01-07T06:23:00.000Z	riotkittie		i have my laptop connected to the modem via crossover. the desktop's connected to the modem via usb.  i havent noticed any differenre
2007-01-07T06:23:00.000Z	riotkittie		or difference, either
2007-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	riotkittie		then again, the desktop is my husband's XP box of horror. i try to steer clear when i can :P
2007-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	some modem can't work that way anyways mine can't I can't use usb and ethernet together
2007-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	i was surprised to find out that it could actually be done
2007-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	probably because it uses flash 9?
2007-01-07T10:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	>> i have flash 9 installed but there is this weird neon green box that covers most of the page :/
2007-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	ath0 is your wireless card
2007-01-14T16:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	oh. i thought so :P  considering ifconfig showed it when i had my card in. but. :P
2007-01-14T16:25:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	wireless again probably :P
2007-01-14T16:25:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	thought so too. but. if ... hm. ah. nevermind :p
2007-01-17T12:15:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	it does that
2007-01-24T11:16:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	no
2007-01-25T09:22:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	that's how some people install certain software before they install the real system
2007-02-01T14:44:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	it's also though Vista so the security is a tad tighter then XP
2007-02-01T14:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	i dont need a password to access mine. sometimes i am asked if i try to enter my My Documents but otherwise, no pass required
2007-02-01T14:45:00.000Z	riotkittie	kitche	ah
2007-02-19T10:16:00.000Z	kitche	riotkittie	hope your not using slackware.com a mirror would be faster
