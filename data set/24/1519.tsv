2009-12-09T22:37:00.000Z	^workman^		chamunks: what's broken?
2009-12-09T22:37:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	none of my web pages load at all anymore :(
2009-12-09T22:38:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I did
2009-12-09T22:39:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	just a basic lamp stack with the torrentflux package and phpmyadmin
2009-12-09T22:40:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	i'm not sure where that could be I usually just fresh install to avoid these problems.
2009-12-09T22:46:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I'm not sure what here is significant http://paste.ubuntu.com/338135/
2009-12-09T22:47:00.000Z	^workman^	Chamunks	when you did your upgrade, did you use "apt-get upgrade"?
2009-12-09T22:48:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	this morning before i went to bed and i did a aptitude dist-upgrade
2009-12-09T22:48:00.000Z	^workman^	Chamunks	looks like mysql hasn't been updated, errors with php5 too, I'd run sudo apt-get update
2009-12-09T22:49:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	current ubuntu version 9.04 if that helps
2009-12-09T22:50:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	how long will you be here ill try upgrading all the way to 9.10
2009-12-09T22:51:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	because theres no updates for any packages apparently.  Work stinks.
2009-12-09T22:52:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I can get a dist upgrade I think I'll just do that and check back in with you when its done.
2009-12-09T22:53:00.000Z	^workman^	Chamunks	ok
2009-12-09T22:53:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	ahh heres something it wants to only let me run a partial upgrade as apparently some previous update didnt finish I remember theres a command to fix this
2009-12-09T22:54:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	unfortunately I cant remember what command
2009-12-09T23:00:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I'll try that
2009-12-09T23:03:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	this is so strange apt doesent seem to recognize any package failures but when i run a dist upgrade it does
2009-12-09T23:06:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	i guess if i knew everything about it i wouldnt be soo interested in learning it but damn you nix
2009-12-09T23:29:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I've gone with the upgrade to 9.10 I'm going to see how that will work out than I'll just run a tasksel and remove the lamp stack than re install it again using tasksel
2009-12-09T23:30:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	heres hoping I dont totally nuke this setup in the process I'm not ready for switching this computer over to being a zfs based NAS yet.
2009-12-09T23:31:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	thx I have a feeling i'll need it lol.
2009-12-09T23:32:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	I cant wait till i have the spare $ for the nas setup though its going to be schmexy 5tb 5 disk zpools on sata2 multiplier backplanes.
2009-12-09T23:33:00.000Z	Chamunks	^workman^	zfs is like filesystem porn if there ever were to be such a thing.
