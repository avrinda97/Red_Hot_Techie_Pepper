2008-02-06T22:09:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		is there a list somewhere of which programs are usable on the 7.04 live cd?
2008-02-06T22:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		or sudo su
2008-02-06T22:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		it's about freedom. we can second guess anyone. that
2008-02-06T22:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		that's the point
2008-02-06T22:11:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	and i'm free to ban you for giving new users bad advice.
2008-02-06T22:11:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	freedom goes both ways.
2008-07-01T07:57:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	i don;t understand how running public services necessitates a firewall
2008-07-01T07:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	it's a good security practise.
2008-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	i don't see how running public services changes anything, though
2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	there's more risk when you run a webserver, ftp server etc.
2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	how does a firewall help that, though?
2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	because a firewall will block traffic that is unwanted.
2008-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	a firewall restricts access to ports. running a public service by definition means you want ports open. so a firewall is useful to a public facing server only for the ports it closes.
2008-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	unless you get into IP or netblock restrictions, which has to be automated to scale well
2008-07-01T08:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	yes. exactly. would you recommend running a webserver without a firewall?
2008-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	i do.
2008-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	what would a firewall give me? the abilit to ... block access to a server i set up so people can access it
2008-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	block access to ports that you don't want people trying to exploit
2008-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	if there are no services answering on those ports, a firewall is pointless.
2008-07-01T08:03:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	then why do they exist?
2008-07-01T08:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	there are god reasons to run a firewall. but simply having a public facing server doesn't translate into a need for a firewall.
2008-07-01T08:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	mneptok	ok. I'm listening.
2008-07-01T08:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	for instance, to specifically redirect traffic across ports.
2008-07-01T08:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Seven_Six_Two	or allow access only from certain IPs or netblocks
