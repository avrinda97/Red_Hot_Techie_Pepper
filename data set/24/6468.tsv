2006-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	cbruno		why does everyone who uses my ubuntu machines think they are on a MAC???
2006-12-23T13:04:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	Because it isn't Windows, so it must be a computer made by that little company named after a fruit. There isn't anything else, is there? :)
2006-12-23T13:17:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	Many scripting languages have support for gnome. Ruby is my favourite.
2006-12-23T13:22:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	ruby
2006-12-23T13:23:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	or python, or javascript (yes, javascript), or gambas, or ...
2006-12-23T13:23:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	It requires a runtime, but isn't that large.
2006-12-23T13:27:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	wxwidgets isn't bad, that is true. And it has wide support in scripting languages as well, if I recall.
2006-12-23T13:30:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	I think you just need to install XeTeX. But I've never used it.
2006-12-23T13:42:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	I'm not sure. If they don't, they should. It would probably be profitable.
2006-12-23T13:43:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	I think they support desktops as well.
2006-12-23T13:44:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	With update-manager, amazingly.
2006-12-23T13:44:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	It isn't.
2006-12-23T14:00:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	About HP - I would contact someone higher up - you certainly have not voided your warranty.
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	I don't like binary drivers.
2006-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	system76 actually has reasonable prices, as does laclinux
2006-12-23T14:09:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	no
2006-12-23T14:14:00.000Z	cge	cbruno	It is only a hobby OS from a home desktop user perspective.
