2009-11-06T04:31:00.000Z	dewd		Hi I've installed libnss-ldap, this installs some other packages as well, somehow the configuration done by me was not ok but after an purge/install it does not ask the configuration questions again
2009-11-06T04:32:00.000Z	dewd		I've tried dpkg-reconfigure but this is not helping
2009-11-06T04:32:00.000Z	dewd		how do i get an package to ask config questions again??
2009-11-06T04:33:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	what you want to know about it ?
2009-11-06T04:35:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	srry talked to wrong person
2009-11-06T04:35:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	, I want it to ask the questions again from first install admin dn, ldap host etc etc
2009-11-06T04:35:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	I tried purge and removed all configfiles but somehow these do not get reinstalled as well :-(
2009-11-06T04:37:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	the wiki about ldap auth talks about configfiles that I think are obsolete in karmic..
2009-11-06T04:38:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	might be, many things changed from older wikis, suffer that, too
2009-11-06T04:39:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	but you know how to trigger an package to reconfigure itself ?
2009-11-06T04:40:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	I haven't followed your whole story, dpkg is the right tootl for that
2009-11-06T04:41:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	I want an package to ask me again the initial configuration questions
2009-11-06T04:41:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	: which package ?
2009-11-06T04:42:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	i think auth-client-config
2009-11-06T04:44:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	: second, trying
2009-11-06T04:44:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	i found it
2009-11-06T04:44:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	wrong package its ldap-auth-config
2009-11-06T04:45:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	no such package
2009-11-06T04:45:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	dpkg-reconfigure ldap-auth-config works though
2009-11-06T04:45:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	heh, you're fast !!
2009-11-06T04:46:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	if only it would actually connect to my ldap server
2009-11-06T04:46:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	that was no problem in jaunty karmic doesn't work :-(
2009-11-06T04:47:00.000Z	DasEi	dewd	yep, the upstart-changes
2009-11-06T04:47:00.000Z	dewd	DasEi	doesn't even try to connect
