2008-07-01T09:16:00.000Z	Blaqlight		ok then first try sudo apt-get update
2008-07-01T09:16:00.000Z	Blaqlight		then sudo aptitude install apache
2008-07-01T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	neptunepink, its apache2, apache won't work.
2008-07-01T09:18:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	indeed, sorry
2008-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	right.  Those are packages that depend on it, not that it depends on.
2008-07-19T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	foo depends on bar and bar depends on baz, installing foo installs bar and baz, removing bar removes foo, but not baz.
2008-07-23T12:40:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	the reason I asked was purel because its not really about ubuntu per se.
2008-07-23T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	Well, ask anyway, or ask in #conky
2008-07-27T05:34:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	thanks for the mouse howto, I was wondering how to get this other button (back button in windows) working.
2008-07-27T05:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	On your mouse?
2008-07-27T05:35:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	yeah its got this "extra" button, supposed to work like back in browser in windows, it nevered it ubuntu.
2008-07-27T05:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	And the ManyButtonMouse stuff doesn't work?
2008-07-27T05:36:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	haven't tried, Im reading up on it now.
2008-07-27T05:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	Its unlikely it wont solve your problem
2008-08-01T04:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	Yes?
2008-08-01T04:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	Thanks
2008-08-01T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	It has to do with the fact that the benefits of using aptitude only happen when you use aptitude for everything.  apt-get doesn't have said requirements for full functionalities.
2008-08-01T08:34:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	ahh I see.
2008-08-01T08:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	with the introduction of autoremove (in ... edgy? feisty?) aptitude's "remove all the unused dependencies" were into mainline apt-get (instead of using deborphan)
2008-08-01T10:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	do you have the full version?
2008-08-01T10:57:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	probably not, how do I tell?
2008-08-01T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	You'll need to install "vim" if you haven't.  The default version is fairly... useless for most people.
2008-08-01T11:00:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Flannel	I have, it runs, but it is uhm.. quite useless. to me, Id love to use it because it comes highly recommended.
2008-08-01T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Blaqlight	ah, you don't know how to use vim? alright, run "vimtutor" and it'll get you up to speed.
