2007-02-14T11:32:00.000Z	blazemonger		even simple stuff such as my gnome pannels freezing causing me to reboot
2007-02-14T11:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		my graphics card works just fine in windows
2007-02-14T11:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		and debian sid even
2007-02-14T11:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		but ubuntu is the one distro that is the slowest of them all
2007-02-14T11:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		maybe you have to have a top of the line pc to use gnome in ubuntu
2007-02-14T11:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		i love ubuntu lolman
2007-02-14T11:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		i WANT to be able to actually use it instead of spending hours and hours trying to get things working
2007-02-14T11:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		because i want to be able to use ubuntu
2007-02-14T11:35:00.000Z	blazemonger		what kind of setups do you folks have that have no probs with ubuntu?
2007-02-14T11:36:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	how will that help you correct a problem you have?
2007-02-14T11:38:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	I run a AMD 1400 with 2gigs of ram on my server
2007-02-14T11:38:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	which ubuntu did you use, Edgy, Dapper or the new Feisty?
2007-02-14T11:44:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	which ubuntu did you use, Edgy, Dapper or the new Feisty?
2007-02-14T11:45:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	LiveCD's?
2007-02-14T11:47:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	perhaps you would do better with one of the alternate CD installs..
2007-02-14T11:48:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	scroll down the page a ways, http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/linux/ubuntu-releases/6.06/
2007-02-14T11:48:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	yes
2007-02-14T11:49:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	good luck
2007-02-14T11:50:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	it can yes.
2007-02-15T13:11:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	have you considered using the Kubuntu version?
2007-02-15T13:14:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	well, my experience with Ubuntu was that it seemed a lil bit more involved getting it setup to work the way I liked.. but once I did, it seems to me to be much better than the other distro's I've tried.. Suse, Opensuse, Mandriva,Freespire,PClinuxOS,Sabayon (although this one was almost perfect) an several others
2007-02-15T13:15:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	hate to hear that, I think the other distro's run a lil better out of the box so to speak, but I'm glad I stuck with working out my troubles with Ubuntu, overal I'm totally happy with it now
2007-02-15T13:16:00.000Z	royel	blazemonger	an several wipes an installs of other distros in between, yes :)
