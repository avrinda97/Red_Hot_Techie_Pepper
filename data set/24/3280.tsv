2008-03-07T02:22:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Anyone watch Unstarved in here?
2008-03-07T02:24:00.000Z	Ozymandius		You all know that Ubuntu blows right?
2008-03-07T02:24:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Gentoo is so much better
2008-03-07T02:24:00.000Z	Ozymandius		I mean, things actually work
2008-03-07T02:24:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	and takes 3 days to get them all compiled and running..yeah great
2008-03-07T02:24:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Everything you think should work in Ubuntu just dies
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius	macogw	Really? I can get a system up in 3 hours max
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		No, it says ubuntu in here
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Yeah
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		3 hours
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	you have no gui then huh?
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		ion
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		It's gui
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	unless youre using sabayon or have a supercomputer, no way you're compiling everything in that time...
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	Ozymandius		No matter what OS you run, you need ion
2008-03-07T02:26:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	lets have a race.  my apt, your emerge. which do you think will be faster?
2008-03-07T02:26:00.000Z	Ozymandius	macogw	Default install now isn't compile, just install new things with compile
2008-03-07T02:26:00.000Z	Ozymandius	macogw	Probably apt, since I don't even use emerge
2008-03-07T02:26:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	O_o thats not even gentoo then....thats like...O_o dang dan's gonna be going for LFS soon
2008-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	Ozymandius		I use paludis
2008-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Alternative package manager
2008-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	so basically not gentoo at all, really
2008-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	Ozymandius		Actually, its completely gentoo, uses the same tree
2008-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	macogw	Ozymandius	all linux uses the same upstream sources
