2011-11-20T01:43:00.000Z	n00berG00ber		why won't my login screen change to what I tell it to in /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf ??? anyone?
2011-11-20T01:45:00.000Z	n00berG00ber		is there a different channel that new guys can go for help?
2011-11-20T01:45:00.000Z	n00berG00ber		oic
2011-11-20T01:47:00.000Z	n00berG00ber		okay once again: (third times a charm) why won't my login screen change to what I point it to in /etc/lightdm/unity-greeter.conf?
2011-11-20T01:48:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	have you restarted the lightdm process
2011-11-20T01:48:00.000Z	n00berG00ber		multiple times....my login screen is now just black
2011-11-20T01:49:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	multiple times....my login screen is now just black
2011-11-20T01:49:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	sounds like it doesn't like something in that file
2011-11-20T01:50:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	so the default if there is something wrong is to display a black bachground then?
2011-11-20T01:51:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	i dont know but that sounds like a feasible behavior
2011-11-20T01:52:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	essentially, at least from my understanding, is the syntax is "background=path_to_picture/picture.jpg"
2011-11-20T01:53:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	and what is the picture you want to use?
2011-11-20T01:53:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	I've tried several
2011-11-20T01:53:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	but what is the path
2011-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	/home/username/Pictures/wallpaper
2011-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	do you have an encrypted home directory
2011-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	yup....and now that you have said it, it would make sense that it doesn't work.
2011-11-20T01:54:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	and even that shouldn't matter in either case the lightdm process won't be able to read that file
2011-11-20T01:55:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	even if it were unencrypted?
2011-11-20T01:55:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	permission issues then?
2011-11-20T01:55:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	you could adjust the permissions to make it work with an unencrypted
2011-11-20T01:56:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	where,outside, of home would it be considered kosher to store picture files?
2011-11-20T01:56:00.000Z	escott	n00berG00ber	/usr/local or /opt
2011-11-20T01:57:00.000Z	n00berG00ber	escott	thanks
