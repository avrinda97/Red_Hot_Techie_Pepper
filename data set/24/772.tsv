2011-01-29T11:25:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	do you have sound without the headphones?
2011-01-29T11:26:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	check you didn't mute the speakers in alsamixer
2011-01-29T11:27:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	ok you have sound - what are you trying to play when you have no sound?
2011-01-29T11:28:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	have you installed the appropriate codecs?
2011-01-29T11:29:00.000Z	trans	guest_0_0_	all multimedia codecs were installed
2011-01-29T11:30:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	save anything important then go to terminal - type - sudo pkill Xorg
2011-01-29T11:35:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	have you installed the gstreamer plugins?
2011-01-29T11:43:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	are you positive the headphones are still working?
2011-01-29T11:47:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	it sounds like the new headphones aren't working
2011-01-29T11:47:00.000Z	trans	guest_0_0_	can I test with them
2011-01-29T11:47:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	try that and see if you get sound
2011-01-29T11:51:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	is there another cable for the microphone
2011-01-29T11:52:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	so there is only one cable coming from them
2011-01-29T11:53:00.000Z	guest_0_0_	trans	if there is only one cable I'm not sure how you are going to get input
