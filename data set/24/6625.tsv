2005-09-07T06:53:00.000Z	zdennis		wmas are bloated
2005-09-07T06:55:00.000Z	zdennis		is there a way to tell XMMS to look in all subdirectories for mp3s to add to library? instead of manually selecting files
2005-09-07T06:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	select the directory and say add
2005-09-07T06:56:00.000Z	zdennis	robotgeek	i get "Add Selected Files", "Add all files in directory"
2005-09-07T06:57:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	hold the add sign, it pops up add directory
2005-09-07T06:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	click + file for abt 2 secs, then for the expanded menu, select + dir , and select ur music folder
2005-09-07T07:02:00.000Z	zdennis	robotgeek	i must be doing something wrong. Is this all within the "Add files to media library" ...window?
2005-09-07T07:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	we are talking abt xmms, right?
2005-09-07T07:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	get beep-media-player :)
2005-09-07T07:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	much better :)
2005-09-07T07:09:00.000Z	zdennis	robotgeek	i got it up and going, maybe my nfs share just sucks
2005-09-07T07:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	xmms is dead!
2005-09-07T07:12:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	cool

2005-09-07T07:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	put the tar .gz file in ~/.bmp/Skins and select it from preferences
2006-01-25T13:58:00.000Z	robotgeek	zdennis	wouldn't a simple export work?
2006-01-25T13:58:00.000Z	zdennis	robotgeek	yeah you're right
