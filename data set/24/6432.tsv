2007-09-05T11:16:00.000Z	george	KurtKraut	did you follow a specific how-to?
2007-09-05T11:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	I can't remember... but I found one that seems correct to me
2007-09-05T11:17:00.000Z	george		might you have it saved in your bookmarks?
2007-09-05T11:17:00.000Z	george		I searched google for nearly a half hour.

2007-09-05T11:18:00.000Z	george		I'm not sure.
2007-09-05T11:18:00.000Z	george		glxinfo|grep vendor? I'm assuming?
2007-09-05T11:19:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	what this command prompts to you ? OpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc. ?
2007-09-05T11:19:00.000Z	george		server glx vendor string: SGI
2007-09-05T11:19:00.000Z	george		client glx vendor string: SGI
2007-09-05T11:19:00.000Z	george		OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org
2007-09-05T11:20:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	You have to first make ATI propriery driver working. And then https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl
2007-09-05T11:20:00.000Z	george		enabling the restricted driver now.
2007-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	have you tried to set beryl or compiz before, right ?
2007-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	george		yes, on a Dell with an NVidia card.
2007-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	george		this is an HP, with the ATI 200M
2007-09-05T11:22:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	I have a HP too :P What model ? I have a hp6040
2007-09-05T11:22:00.000Z	george		DV5000
2007-09-05T11:22:00.000Z	george		got to restart
2007-09-05T11:23:00.000Z	KurtKraut	george	anyway... the wiki I gave you should be enough after installing and properly running the ATI restricted driver
