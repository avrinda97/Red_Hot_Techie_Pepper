2011-02-03T11:49:00.000Z	madmn		what is the best way to network ubuntu and windows 7 through a wireless connection or can it be done
2011-02-03T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	using a router
2011-02-03T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	grab a wireless router and connect the hosts to it, you now have a network
2011-02-03T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	the router will distribute dhcp so addresses will allow connections of any sort
2011-02-03T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	what are you trying to achieve?
2011-02-03T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	setup what? The dhcp will automatically be given to all connected hosts
2011-02-03T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	if you can ping it you can 'see' the box
2011-02-03T11:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	do you mean FILE SHARING?
2011-02-03T11:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	ok what sort of server do you want the ubuntu system to be?
2011-02-03T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	file sharing does not mean 'network'
2011-02-03T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	why do people term it that way, it means noting
2011-02-03T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	you can have a 'network' and run an email server and it has nothing to do with file sharing
2011-02-03T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	if you use that terminology (the right terminology) you'll get fatser results
2011-02-03T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	if you install samba, you can share folders. Win7 has some dumbass authentication in it now which Ubuntu has issues with but can be worked around

2011-02-03T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer   for help making a mailserver
2011-02-03T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	yes, that will allow you to share folders in nautilus and they will be visible as windows shares to windows
2011-02-03T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	then right click folders to share in nautilus and share them
2011-02-03T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	the 192 is the actual IP
2011-02-03T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	just add the rest of the address
2011-02-22T09:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	you can connect to FTP servers using firefox etc
2011-02-22T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	you can use filezilla in windows to connect to SFTP
2011-02-22T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	if you have SFTP then you don't need FTP
2011-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	madmn	you will need to upgrade to maverick (10.10) first
