2006-08-09T10:21:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	ROFLLMFAO grab the tarball
2006-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	:| wtf please explain
2006-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	then grab the windows version
2006-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	the very top one?
2006-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	i'm not looking at the site but in order to run VMWare Server you need windows server 2003
2006-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	it runs on xp for some reason
2006-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	it does for now but it was made for Server 2003
2006-08-09T10:24:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	either use VMWare Player and use something like easyvmx to make a VM with or repartition and multiboot ubuntu and windows
2006-08-09T10:26:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	kk I'm getting vmplayer thank you :)
2006-08-09T10:27:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	my best advice is get a repartitioning tool and multiboot (you get the choice if which you want to load when you boot up)
2006-08-09T10:29:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	it isn't safe for one thing
2006-08-09T10:29:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	VMWare has been b0rked so it leaked into the host OS several times now
2006-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	:(
2006-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	ubuntu is quite safe (so even if VMWare b0rks things should be ok) and if things don't go well then just grab one of the many other distros around!
2006-08-09T10:32:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	you're a great help :) thank you
2006-08-09T10:32:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	I really gotta try this I heard its friendly for windows geeks like myeslf
2006-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	TBH the software itself isn't what makes it friendly - it's the support you get
2006-08-09T10:35:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	keep this in mind: Linux is the OS so if this distro isn't to your liking (i bet it will be but...) then try another one
2006-08-09T10:36:00.000Z	fuzzybunny	NthDegree	I've tinkered w/Debian before and have deployed a few IPCop solutions as well
2006-08-09T10:39:00.000Z	NthDegree	fuzzybunny	ubuntu has a lot of textual bits to do too :) but the support here should help if you get stuck
