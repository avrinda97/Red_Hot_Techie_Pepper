2012-11-21T09:37:00.000Z	rafase282		hello can someone help me with ssh? I want to set it up so I can ssh from outside my lan
2012-11-21T09:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	port forward port 22/TCP in your routr to the IP of the system running the ssh server
2012-11-21T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	sure
2012-11-21T10:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	maybe the mobile network blocks pings
2012-11-21T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	the host name will not resolve to your WAN IP unless you add it in your system's hosts file
2012-11-21T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	you need to check the port forwarding in the router
2012-11-21T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	I can connect to your IP
2012-11-21T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	obviously I don't have credentials
2012-11-21T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	I did a whois on you and it gave a hostname. I then SSH'd to it and got asked for credentials
2012-11-21T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	I can't get in, I don't have an account. But I hit an SSH server
2012-11-21T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	how do you mean 'will not work'?
2012-11-21T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	what are yu trying to do with transmission?
2012-11-21T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	I do the same, did you enable the web UI?
2012-11-21T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	and what port is it using?
2012-11-21T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	then match that port in the port forwarding the same way you setup SSH
2012-11-21T10:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	you can use SFTP which you get with openssh-server and access your data from anywhere
2012-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	have you configured any firewalling on the server?
2012-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	nautilus can do it, no need for 'commands'
2012-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	you have a router so you'll be fine
2012-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	tried changing the port number then resetting up the port forward?
2012-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	so how is this an ubuntu issue if the server is arch?
2012-11-21T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	but this channel is OS specific
2012-11-21T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	the server OS is arch
2012-11-21T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafase282	if you are having issues with the server then ask in the arch channel
