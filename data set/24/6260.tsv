2005-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	LotsaCabo		Okay, I'm missing something.  Everything I try to install says that it has dependencies and cannot install them.  Are there repository changes that need to be changed usually?
2005-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	try sudo apt-get update, then sudo apt-get -f install and then it may work
2005-11-24T16:04:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	So, everyone uses apt instead of the Symbian thing?
2005-11-24T16:04:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	Synaptic is just a frontend for apt-get
2005-11-24T16:04:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Cool.  Thanx.
2005-11-24T16:05:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	np
2005-11-24T16:09:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Does everything have to be forced during their install?  If so, then why?  For example, I'm trying to install Eclipse and I'm getting errors like, "eclipse-platform: Depends: eclipse-rcp (= 3.1.1-1ubuntu3) but it is not going to be installed
2005-11-24T16:09:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	shouldnt happen much, are you running breezy?
2005-11-24T16:10:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Yup, just got the CDs in the mail.
2005-11-24T16:10:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	There are also dependencies for Qt 3 that are needed but aren't in the "universe" or CD repositories.
2005-11-24T16:12:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	i just tried to install ecplise-platform, had no dependency problems - i can send you my sources.list if you like
2005-11-24T16:12:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Sure, that would be great.  But, did you add any sources that aren't default?
2005-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	a few i think, like openoffice2 final and wine
2005-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Those shouldn't affect Eclipse or Qt, though.
2005-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	Did you add universe and multiverse??
2005-11-24T16:13:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	"multiverse?"
2005-11-24T16:14:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	not sure if that would do it, but its always the first thing i do on ubuntu
2005-11-24T16:14:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	Open synaptic and go to repositories
2005-11-24T16:15:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	I'm there... just the CD and "Universe."
2005-11-24T16:16:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	if you click add and add the repositories (with universe and multiverse ticked) then do an apt-get update see if it helps
2005-11-24T16:18:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Hmm... interesting.  Although the comments list the "Universe" entry as "Community maintained," that is the ONLY checkbox that is not selected for it.  Is that correct?
2005-11-24T16:18:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	Not really sure i have them all ticked.
2005-11-24T16:20:00.000Z	matsavhalev	LotsaCabo	also you can always remove/change them later
2005-11-24T16:24:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	matsavhalev	Well, it appears to have worked.  Thanx!  =)
