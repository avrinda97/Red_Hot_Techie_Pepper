2006-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	Uriku		I can't remove the CD
2006-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	Uriku		it says that device is busy
2006-09-27T13:26:00.000Z	Uriku		please help me, the CD won't come out in the middle of the install
2006-09-27T13:27:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	what are you trying to do?
2006-09-27T13:28:00.000Z	Uriku		I am trying to instal Unreal Tournament 2004 (after I understood I had to do bash: linux-installer.sh -.-
2006-09-27T13:28:00.000Z	Uriku		it asks for CD2
2006-09-27T13:28:00.000Z	Uriku		and it won't let it out
2006-09-27T13:28:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	your shell probably has the working directory on the CD.
2006-09-27T13:29:00.000Z	Uriku		so what do I do?
2006-09-27T13:29:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	try to run the installer form another directory: "cd /tmp; bash /media/cdrom/installer.sh" or whatever
2006-09-27T13:30:00.000Z	Uriku		hmm so just run it from another directory?
2006-09-27T13:31:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	yup, try it (if you currently are running it from a shell whose working dir is on the CD)
2006-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	Uriku		hey it's asking me if I want to install symbolic links:
2006-09-27T13:32:00.000Z	Uriku		what does it mean?
2006-09-27T13:33:00.000Z	Hans-Martin		does anyone know how I can assign a fixed name to a PCMCIA WLAN card? it sometimes comes up as eth1, sometimes eth2 or eth3, and I always need to reconfigure the WEP parameters...
2006-09-27T13:34:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	in what context? it might want to install a link on your desktop - or it might want to install only part of the game on your HD, keeping the rest on CD
2006-09-27T13:35:00.000Z	Uriku		"Do you want to install sybmbolic links to a directory in your path"
2006-09-27T13:35:00.000Z	Uriku		then it asks if I where do I want to put it
2006-09-27T13:36:00.000Z	Uriku	Code-E	I know that problem, you need to untick the online video feature
2006-09-27T13:37:00.000Z	Uriku		yay it works!
2006-09-27T13:37:00.000Z	Uriku		^_^
2006-09-27T13:37:00.000Z	Uriku		thanks
2006-09-27T13:37:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	Uriku	congrats
