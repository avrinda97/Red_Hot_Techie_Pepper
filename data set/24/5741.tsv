2011-10-06T10:54:00.000Z	koa		hello
2011-10-06T10:56:00.000Z	koa		guys when Canonical is gona cut support for ubuntu 11.4 ?
2011-10-06T10:57:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	04 2011 + 18 months
2011-10-06T10:58:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	so 18 months after it's release support/updates/maintenance will stop
2011-10-06T11:02:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	the issue you have is you want to use wine
2011-10-06T11:02:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	that's never going to be a production class option
2011-10-06T11:03:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	it will/work/break/work/break different with each week and each different application.
2011-10-06T11:03:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	the bottom line is if you want to run windows programs, use windows
2011-10-06T11:04:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	if you need to use windows applications, it's the most realisitc option.
2011-10-06T11:04:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	games require direct hardware access fo virtualisation isn't really an option, and wine is not a production solution
2011-10-06T11:05:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	today, sure, tomorrow now.
2011-10-06T11:05:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	it's such a hit and miss option, but it's totally your choice
2011-10-06T11:07:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	it's not a stable release yet, hence why it's not working out of the box
2011-10-06T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	you'll get great experiences like that today, and tomorrow it could be totally different
2011-10-06T11:11:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	you're never going to get it as it's not direct hardware access, sorry
2011-10-06T11:11:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	although it is improviging
2011-10-06T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	don't need proof - it's your personal experience
2011-10-06T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	if you are happy with 11.04 - just keep using it
2011-10-06T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	we don't need convincing
2011-10-06T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	if you are happy, continue to use it
2011-10-06T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	ok, I think we get the message
2011-10-06T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	this channel can be used to help you with ubuntu issues, it's not a general chat channel
2011-10-06T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	in case what ?
2011-10-06T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia	koa	the deb files are stored in the ubuntu repo
