2008-04-08T23:02:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	you should be able to >=1024, how are you trying?
2008-04-08T23:05:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	hmm, i would go through these files to see if anything's out of order - /var/log/{dmesg,debug,syslog}
2008-04-08T23:06:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	everything looks fine in the logs
2008-04-08T23:07:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	any other suggestions?
2008-04-08T23:07:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	it takes time trawling through those files and you need to put on your 'scrutiny' goggles before examining them .. small things do count, apart from that all i can suggest is having a look on launchpad if someone else might have experienced the same thing
2008-04-08T23:08:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	its on a server, so its a bad thing if its down for long
2008-04-08T23:08:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	i guess i'll have to reinstall the OS when i get the time, i wish ubuntu was a little more stable, i would hate to go back to debian
2008-04-08T23:09:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	have you got any iptables rules in place?
2008-04-08T23:09:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	i was thinking it was a networking problem
2008-04-08T23:10:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	how did this condition come to be? i'm assuming it was all working fine at some point .
2008-04-08T23:10:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	the sudo /etc/init.d/networking start fails to start
2008-04-08T23:10:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	yes, i restart my computer
2008-04-08T23:10:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	what happens when you manually try and bring the interfaces up?
2008-04-08T23:11:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	the error in the /etc/init.d/networking start gives me errors with ifup and ifdown
2008-04-08T23:11:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	so i am assuming i can't start/stop them manually (atheros at ath0)
2008-04-08T23:11:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	you make too many assumptions -- try it manually .. and pastebin the errors you get
2008-04-08T23:14:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	does that error message give you any ideas what could cause that problem?
2008-04-08T23:14:00.000Z	unop__	linux60284	looks like you have a malformatted or missing interfaces file? check if it exists and if you can .. please put it in a pastebin for us to see
2008-04-08T23:17:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	there we go, i fixed it by removing my bluetooth network
2008-04-08T23:17:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	let me see if i can bind now
2008-04-08T23:17:00.000Z	linux60284	unop__	no, i still can't bind, but at least i can /etc/init.d/network restart successfully
