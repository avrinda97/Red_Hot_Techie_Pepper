2010-12-31T11:49:00.000Z	ox3a		I want to remove Gnome environment and installing kde just customizing ubuntu 10.10. Can anyone suggest me please?
2010-12-31T11:49:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Better off installking kubuntu. But if you still want to give it a shot, just choose to install the KDE environment from synaptic.
2010-12-31T11:50:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	and how to remove complete gnome?
2010-12-31T11:51:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Install Kubuntu. It'll be way easier than dealing with the removal of Gnome.
2010-12-31T11:51:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	actually i do not have much idea about kbuntu that if i miss anything in kubuntu
2010-12-31T11:54:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	any different ubuntu 10.10 and kubuntu 10.10?
2010-12-31T11:56:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	and will i get everything of ubuntu in kubuntu?
2010-12-31T11:56:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Not entirely. But a lot of things for Ubuntu are gnome-specific.
2010-12-31T11:58:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	yeah but such will i miss such as server,database,networking software?
2010-12-31T12:00:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	It's your best bet to try out kubuntu for the best KDE experience. Some applications in Ubuntu will break using Gnome apps unless there are KDE-supported Gnome applications.
2010-12-31T12:01:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	i am worry if i miss very nice tools of ubuntu in kubuntu. Will it?
2010-12-31T12:01:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	We're just trying to say, you are better off trying Kubuntu for Ubuntu+KDE so you don't break Ubuntu trying to remove Gnome in favor for KDE.
2010-12-31T12:04:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	Will i able to install all tools of ubuntu in kubuntu?
2010-12-31T12:04:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Some, maybe. Like Firefox.
2010-12-31T12:04:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	ok
2010-12-31T12:07:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Just download Kubuntu from kubuntu.com, burn it to CD and boot from CD.
2010-12-31T12:10:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	I find Gnome menu editing very easy too. Can you explain why you want to make the switch?
2010-12-31T12:13:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	also needs to be more specific with what applications for Gnome he wants to carry over into KDE.
2010-12-31T12:16:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	can you tell me  about uck?
2010-12-31T12:16:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	yea all thing
2010-12-31T12:18:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	there is a option for kde env (Just i wanna customize my ubuntu)
2010-12-31T12:21:00.000Z	tiox	ox3a	Nope.
2010-12-31T12:26:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	I was made a iso file after installed kde in ubuntu(and i also added my 1.5 gb compiled software)But i was took 2.5 gb and remastersys did not make it properly
2010-12-31T12:37:00.000Z	ox3a	tiox	there is a package "kde-full". Will it do?
