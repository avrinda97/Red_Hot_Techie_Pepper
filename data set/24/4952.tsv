2007-01-02T09:18:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	it just crashed
2007-01-02T09:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	you arent feeding it enough then lol
2007-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	go to #ubuntu-bots if you want to play with ubotu
2007-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	/msg ubotu searchterm is also good :)
2007-01-02T11:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	what do you want it to do before ubuntu boots?
2007-01-02T11:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	sudo apt-get install xfce4 then log out and chose xfce at login under sessions
2007-01-02T11:19:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	I want to install it from a disc I burned
2007-01-02T11:19:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	so it formats my hard drive at the same time
2007-01-02T11:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	you want to do a fresh install of xubuntu?
2007-01-02T11:19:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	Yep
2007-01-02T11:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	bios set to boot from cd first
2007-01-02T11:20:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	I can't
2007-01-02T11:20:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	my keyboard won't work until Ubuntu boots
2007-01-02T11:21:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	any suggestions?
2007-01-02T11:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	maybe you need to hit ESC instead of delete
2007-01-02T11:22:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	no, even the CAPS LOCK light doesn't come on until ubuntu has booted
2007-01-02T11:23:00.000Z	RingDonut	IdleOne	it's like theres no power going to the keyboard
2007-01-02T11:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	RingDonut	sounds like your in a pickle. not sure what to tell you. maybe try a diff keyboard see if it makes a difference
