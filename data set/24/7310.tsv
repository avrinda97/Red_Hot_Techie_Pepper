2006-05-13T07:39:00.000Z	Forgott3n		hey guys, I have finished the partition set-up and changed the to-be linux partition to ext3, but I just got a dialog saying that one partition should be a swap... yes or no?
2006-05-13T07:39:00.000Z	Forgott3n		what does swap do?
2006-05-13T07:39:00.000Z	Forgott3n		it wasn't on my system before?
2006-05-13T07:40:00.000Z	Forgott3n		but...
2006-05-13T07:40:00.000Z	Forgott3n		when I make the linux partition swap, it complains about the root file system
2006-05-13T07:40:00.000Z	Forgott3n		and when I make it ext3 it complains about swap
2006-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Forgott3n		how much does it hinder my system? I have 2gbs of ram
2006-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ddram*
2006-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Forgott3n		not once have I gone over 75% usage of my ram
2006-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	i only have 1GB and i rarely need swap
2006-05-13T07:42:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	as a general rule, you should have double the memory (including ram and swap) as you are ever likely to use
2006-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	that's probably a windows partition... possibly windows 98 or ME
2006-05-13T07:44:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	with 2GB ram, it probably doesn't matter. just be aware that if you ever run out, an application will be killed at random
2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	yes
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	if you have used up all your free space you may need to change the partitioning scheme (ie delete the linux partition and make two smaller ones)
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	and of course, you should have a full backup of all your data before doing *any* partitioning with any OS :)
2006-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	swap - not bootable
2006-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	doesn't matter
2006-05-13T07:56:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	the only difference between logical and primary is that you can only have a max of four primary partitions. if you make one of those logical you can have more
2006-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	sadly yes, once the partition table is written it's mostly wait and see
2006-05-13T08:03:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	there are several thousand
2006-05-13T08:03:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	you will have to choose what you want to learn
2006-05-13T08:04:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	http://www.tldp.org
2006-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	ndazza	Forgott3n	yes that's the way to go
