2009-06-29T19:25:00.000Z	Incarus		who got graphic driver problems?
2009-06-29T19:25:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	legend2440 or an Intel card in 9.04
2009-06-29T19:27:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	dude, i got a SiS graphic card, and its working perfectly in ubuntu
2009-06-29T19:28:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	really? havent had much luck with an old SiS card I had, 800x600 on a 19inch monitor is murder
2009-06-29T19:29:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	yeah, intrepid and hardy did have problems with it, and it didnt work in opensuse
2009-06-29T19:29:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	but  Jaunty (with some Karmic Packages) is working fine for me
2009-06-29T19:30:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	I was trying with Debian testing, Puppy worked fine to give me 1024x768
2009-06-29T19:30:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	offtopic ;-)
2009-06-29T19:30:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	yeah, I know :(
2009-06-29T20:41:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	or xorg.0.log
2009-06-29T20:42:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	either will work :)
2009-06-29T20:51:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	yes, bad drivers
2009-06-29T20:52:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	I had (have) a system that uses that chip, 800x600 max
2009-06-29T20:52:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	trident use "xserver-xorg-video-trident" driver, why dont work 1024x768?
2009-06-29T20:53:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	I think mine was a screen limitation on the actual hardware (toshiba satellite 2520cds)
2009-06-29T20:54:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	direct rendering yes, but not dri or dri capable?
2009-06-29T20:54:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	*or dri 2
2009-06-29T20:54:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	don't think so
2009-06-29T20:55:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	he said "direct rendering: Yes" but it is: "(II) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable"
2009-06-29T20:55:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	should be a driver bug, or?
2009-06-29T20:56:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	possible the card is but the monitor isn't?
2009-06-29T20:56:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	not really
2009-06-29T20:57:00.000Z	Halitech	Incarus	never really played around much, my main use is all 2d and my new card is still supported by ATI
2009-06-29T20:57:00.000Z	Incarus	Halitech	k
