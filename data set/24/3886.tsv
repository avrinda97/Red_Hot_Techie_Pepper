2008-03-16T23:43:00.000Z	veco		how might i find out the -71 error description?
2008-03-16T23:44:00.000Z	Slart	veco	error -71.. in what application? os?
2008-03-16T23:45:00.000Z	veco	Slart	in dmesg it says error -71 when i plug my usb drive
2008-03-16T23:45:00.000Z	Slart	veco	just error -71.. nothing else?
2008-03-16T23:46:00.000Z	veco	Slart	new high speed usb device connected, cannot open port check USB cable, and then error -71
2008-03-16T23:47:00.000Z	veco	Slart	the USB cable is fine, the drive works fine with windblows
2008-03-16T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	veco	no need for the name calling.. it's called windows
2008-03-16T23:48:00.000Z	veco	Slart	i have unmounted it in XP properly, sorry for the name calling i simply hate booting in XP that's all
2008-03-16T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	veco	can you copy/paste the exact error message, please?
2008-03-16T23:50:00.000Z	veco	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59844/
2008-03-16T23:52:00.000Z	Slart	veco	I googled the error message.. some people seem to think it's because some piece of hardware doesn't follow the USB-standard properly.. seems like windows is more forgiving when it comes to this.
2008-03-16T23:53:00.000Z	veco	Slart	i googled it i hate to bother here... it's the second external drive 2.5 inch that is usb ppowered that refuses to work on ubuntu. I tryed it on gutsy, hardy and feisty
2008-03-16T23:53:00.000Z	Slart	veco	some other posts seem to point to some kind of error in the usb modules in linux/ubuntu.. I haven't found anyone with a good solution to the problem
2008-03-16T23:54:00.000Z	Slart	veco	no difference if you boot with the drive connected?
2008-03-16T23:54:00.000Z	veco	Slart	no bypass? no 'hard way' to mount it?
2008-03-16T23:54:00.000Z	veco	Slart	no difference, i tryed it all... connect - boot, boot - connect, dmesg it, syslog it, lsusb lshw lspci do not see it
2008-03-16T23:55:00.000Z	Slart	veco	I haven't seen any solutions in the google results..
2008-03-16T23:55:00.000Z	veco	Slart	tryed to eject it on XP and then connect-boot, no difference

2008-03-16T23:56:00.000Z	veco	Slart	thanks, i googled it for two days as well found many problems, but no solution, have hoped might hard-run it
2008-03-16T23:57:00.000Z	veco	Slart	that gave me an idea, i'll try an external power suply for it, it may help
2008-03-16T23:57:00.000Z	veco	Slart	i simply hate the fact XP runs it fine
2008-03-17T00:01:00.000Z	veco	Slart	for future notice, it works when i booted with hardy, but not in gutsy
2008-03-17T00:07:00.000Z	veco	Slart	thank you, you have been helpful. Cheers!
