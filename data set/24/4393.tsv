2007-05-23T16:00:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	*IF* the original install is still proper (and I might be wrong) I don't see why wouldn't be able to just point Ubuntu at GTK at startup...or merely shutdown your other setup and restart GTK...If you didn't remove it in the ifrst place.
2007-05-23T16:00:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	huh? sorry for being a bit ignorant but I'm still new at this. Could you try to put that in terms I might understand?
2007-05-24T16:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	I don't think you should necessarily depend on my word, b/c I am just learning too...But it seems to me, if your original install of GTK is still proper, all you'd need to do is have GTK start up instead of this hacked version...So long as your old version is still proper.
2007-05-24T16:03:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	so how do I tell my original GTK to start up instead?
2007-05-24T16:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	I'm not sure, but I imagine someone else who's present would know...but I would think you'd want to verify that the original install is good first.
2007-05-24T16:04:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	ok, thanks
2007-05-24T16:06:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	ok, I'll ask someone else on the chat, hold on
2007-05-24T16:24:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	It appears that this article merely relates to a menu applet, you said you have a hacked GTK, you sure it's the same?
2007-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	yes, the only way to get the applet to work is to hack gtk, because it needs to move the whole menu off of gtk based programs
2007-05-24T16:25:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	please, what is the command?
2007-05-24T16:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	If the person who posted this is correct on the name of the package it'd just be "sudo apt-get install libgtk2" But I do not necessarily understand what you did in the first place, I am just telling you how to do what that post says to do.
2007-05-24T16:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	What does it return?
2007-05-24T16:30:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	that it couldn't find the package. and indeed, if you go into synaptics and search for libgtk2 you get a couple dependant files (like libgtk2.0-common, etc.) and it says that they are all installed for me and don't give me the option to reinstall them
2007-05-24T16:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	If it couldn't find the package, that means you are not using the right name.
2007-05-24T16:31:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	exactly, like I said...
2007-05-24T16:31:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	Try apt-get search libgtk
2007-05-24T16:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	My mistake sudo apt-cache search libgtk
2007-05-24T16:34:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	ok, I did that and lot's of packages came up...what am I supposed to do?
2007-05-24T16:34:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	also, if I go into synaptics and search for libgtk2 you get a couple dependant files (like libgtk2.0-common, etc.) and it says that they are all installed for me and don't give me the option to reinstall them
2007-05-24T16:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	I believe that's because the libraries are already installed. But you need to overwrite them to get the correct version.
2007-05-24T16:35:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	Exactly! but how do I do that if it doesn't give me the option to reinstall?!
2007-05-24T16:35:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	Using apt-get.
2007-05-24T16:37:00.000Z	PurpZeY	AmirB	I have to go, but it seems sh3r1ff might try to help you out, and he seems to know a lot more than me.
2007-05-24T16:37:00.000Z	AmirB	PurpZeY	ok, thanks a lot for the help you gave!
