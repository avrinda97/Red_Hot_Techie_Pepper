2006-12-01T16:36:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>um...i guess the easiest way is to check the manual that came with your computer
2006-12-01T16:37:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>mine was custom built also but you should have got a book about the motherboard with it
2006-12-01T16:38:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>i'm guessing it is sata....might have to compile 2.6.18 on another machine to add the support for the appropriate controllers...i had a heap of trouble with my new system....
2006-12-01T16:39:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>sorry
2006-12-01T16:41:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>lots of google and forum searching...i was trying with gentoo and someone made a small live cd with a 2.6.18 kernel with support built in for my sata stuff...that or wait until 2.6.19 comes out
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>i was extremely lost at first since I had no experience with anything sata prior....was all a bit much to start off with but eventually got my head around it...sort of :P
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mdious		i'm going to head off, all the best eighty i hope you get your problem sorted out.
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mdious		eighty>haven't had enough time away from work to try the small cd lol....so i don't know...right now it is just a firewall with an ide drive in it
2006-12-01T16:42:00.000Z	mdious		Catcha everyone, take care.
2006-12-01T16:43:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	2.6.19 is out been out for a day now
2006-12-09T06:43:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 what are your thoughts on keeping it hidden...portmapper stuff in hosts.allow and deny...and using ip address/range for access?
2006-12-09T06:44:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	the portmap is good but I use a port knocker also it's more advance a port knocker is but it works
2006-12-09T06:46:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 just getting into NFS a bit...never heard of a port knocker
2006-12-09T06:46:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	well you have to "ping" certain ports to get access to the port you want
2006-12-09T06:48:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 apparently disabling ipv6 helps kde networking doesn't it?
2006-12-09T06:48:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	it helps in everything firefox any networking stuff
2006-12-09T06:49:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 there is a simple way to turn it off right...echo something...do you know it off the top of your head or do i have to go look it up before i go insane thinking about it...ah screw it i'm going to grab it i saw it just the other day hehe
2006-12-09T06:54:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 ip -6 addr flush eth0 is what i was thinking of :)
2006-12-09T10:30:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	you mean mkcpio?
2006-12-09T10:32:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 nah I don't think so...it was something starting with r
2006-12-09T10:33:00.000Z	kitche	mdious	well I know that in the kernel ther eis mkcpio now instead of the old initrd set
2006-12-09T10:33:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 cheers
2006-12-09T10:37:00.000Z	mdious	kitche	 my apologies, that cpio stuff was right...just reading an article about it here:  http://lwn.net/Articles/14776/
