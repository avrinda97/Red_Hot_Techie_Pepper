2005-12-15T06:41:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 As long as the user under which apache runs, can read it, you're good to go.
2005-12-15T06:41:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		ok thanks
2005-12-15T06:42:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		ok... chmod says too few arguments...

2005-12-15T06:43:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		??
2005-12-15T06:44:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		man chmod right?
2005-12-15T06:44:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		ah
2005-12-15T06:44:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 What are you trying to do?
2005-12-15T06:45:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		chmod --usage says unreconized option
2005-12-15T06:45:00.000Z	dpupp-afk	rob_p	im just trying to set a group of files to be readable.
2005-12-15T06:45:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 Readable by apache right?
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		yeah and the world.
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		i thought it had to be in the /var/www
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 Do, "ls -ld /var/www | cut -d ' ' -f1" and tell us what it says.
2005-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	dpupp-afk		hang on a sec. this wil be easier if i log in here from the other machine instead of running back and forth
2005-12-15T06:47:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 It should be drwxr-xr-x and will probably be owned by root.
2005-12-15T06:48:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp-afk	 ...which is fine.  As long as the user under which apache runs, can read it, you're set.
