2007-08-09T11:54:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro		Ubuntu arbitarily stopped mounting my two other internal hard drives, I previously simply mounted them with an NTFS-config program, I haven't even access these drives in the span of when this problem occurred, I checked fstab and it looked fine.
2007-08-09T11:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	Which ntfs program...
2007-08-09T11:55:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Ntfs-3g
2007-08-09T11:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	HAve you scanned them from the windows side?
2007-08-09T11:57:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Anything?
2007-08-09T11:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	HAve you scanned them from the windows side?
2007-08-09T11:57:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	what do you mean
2007-08-09T11:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	You have ntfs  do you also have a windows install on there or why do you have ntfs?
2007-08-09T11:58:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Yes, I also have windows, but it's on an entirely different physical disk, it uses NTFS, and I can't access it anymore, ubuntu can
2007-08-09T11:58:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Ubuntu can't mount is
2007-08-09T11:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	Windows cant load or mount it and ubuntu cant load or mount it... correct.
2007-08-09T11:59:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Windows can load it and/or mount it.
2007-08-09T12:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	So why cant you run windows and scan the ntfs disk that is a problem in ubuntu
2007-08-09T12:01:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	I don't understand what you're trying to tell me, I want ubuntu to be able to access my drives, Windows has no problem.
2007-08-09T12:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	I assume that this worked at some point and now it will not...   Sorry I cant be of any help to you
2007-08-09T12:02:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	I has worked <_<
2007-08-09T12:03:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	sudo fdisk -l | grep NTFS /dev/sda1   *           1        9725    78116031    7  HPFS/NTFS /dev/sdb1   *           1       19457   156288321    7  HPFS/NTFS
2007-08-09T12:03:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	As you can see it can see my drives, I don't know how they can't automatically mount....
2007-08-09T12:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	 You can force mount it but there is a reason it wont mount as normal...  Which is why I suggested you run windows diagnostics on it..
2007-08-09T12:04:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	How do I forcibly mount them?

2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	I personally do not recommend people use ntfs-3g although it seems to work for many people...
2007-08-09T12:07:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Jack_Sparrow	Then what would you recommend?
2007-08-09T12:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AlgorthmicContro	I keep a fat32 as I dont keep files over 4 gig on my system
