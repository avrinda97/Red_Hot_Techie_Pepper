2009-08-17T06:05:00.000Z	apoleo12		I think I might be overlooking something very small?
2009-08-17T06:05:00.000Z	apoleo12		thats an all day thing... but the question come to mind... will I risk anything to loose?
2009-08-17T06:06:00.000Z	apoleo12		yeah I realized that but doing at best is great ;)
2009-08-17T06:07:00.000Z	apoleo12		dr_willis: ok so I have yet to lose anything right?
2009-08-17T06:08:00.000Z	apoleo12		someone here said that having three harddrives that grub wont look for others.. or something like that
2009-08-17T06:08:00.000Z	apoleo12		Nothing too critial... only been using linux for a few weeks... and will continue doing so! :P
2009-08-17T06:08:00.000Z	edbian	apoleo12	It depends what's in your menu.lst  (hd0) is HDD 1  (hd1) is HDD2
2009-08-17T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	apoleo12	You need a boot loader or your OS won't start.  (If you could get rid of it why would you bother fixing it?)
2009-08-17T06:12:00.000Z	edbian	apoleo12	You need a boot loader.  The boot loader sits (partly) in the MBR.  Grub is a boot loader, Lilo is a boot loader, the Windows boot loader is a boot loader.  If you can start an OS you have a boot loader.
2009-08-17T06:13:00.000Z	edbian	apoleo12	That's correct.
2009-08-24T02:48:00.000Z	edbian	apoleo12	ouch!!!  You burned by eyes with that blasphemy!
2009-08-24T02:48:00.000Z	apoleo12	edbian	: Huh?
