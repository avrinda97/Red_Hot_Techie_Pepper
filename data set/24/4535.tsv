2007-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	misfit		dusk, my computer screen flickers black at certain times, like when I'm moving an open window, playing a movie or using the desktop cube, or even when I'm closing a tab in firefox.  I have an nvidia ti 4600 card, latest drivers.  I've also tried disabling desktop effects, to no avail.
2007-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	Dusk_	misfit	is your 3d rendering open??

2007-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	misfit		dusk, I don't know if this helps but this started a couple of days ago, where the last auto update I did involved new nvidia drivers...
2007-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	misfit		dusk, I don't know if I'm using gl desktop, btw.  I think I'm only using compiz.
