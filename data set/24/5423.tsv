2006-07-21T05:04:00.000Z	e-gandalf		hi, I'm looking for some solution to my problem. I'm using Ubuntu Dapper, it works fine, I'm happy. The only problem is that for my work I need dbus 0.62, and I don't know how in Ubuntu world I can solve it, since backports are only for security, and edgy (which has 0.62) is probably very unstable.
2006-07-21T05:05:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	backports are not only for security. actually, backports are *not* for security, that's what dapper-security is for. only, backports haven't yet been activated anyway
2006-07-21T05:05:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	you could probably try compiling the edgy package, but no guarantees
2006-07-21T05:05:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	does it mean that I can wait for backports to eventually backport to dapper? or would it be smarter to get edgy package and try to install it and cross fingers?
2006-07-21T05:06:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	backports only happen if you ask for them, and even then, i'm afraid something like dbus wouldn't get backported, as a lot of things, i believe, depend on it -- backports is mostly for "stand-alone" packages
2006-07-21T05:07:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	don't just get the edgy package anyway - get the *source* package and compile it, that ought to be sort of safer. still do cross your fingers though
2006-07-21T05:11:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	thnx :)
2006-07-21T05:45:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	./configure --prefix=/usr will be enough?
2006-07-21T05:47:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	uh, leave configure alone and just use the apt system to compile... "apt-get -b source packagename", after doing "sudo apt-get build-dep packagename". that should give you a binary package
2006-07-21T05:49:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	ouch, depenencies will kill me here :(
2006-07-21T05:49:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	is it worth trying to compile it on my own if using apt-get -b sources returned tons of required dependencies, but ./configure was happy with what it found?
2006-07-21T05:50:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	not necessarily. perhaps some dependencies are not strictly necessary to compile, but are still needed to enable all the features ubuntu needs. let me have a look
2006-07-21T05:54:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	hm well, i think to be on the safe side you really should install anything that "apt-get build-dep dbus" wants you to instal.
2006-07-21T06:03:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	103 mb update, almost all core packages ;) I think I'll give up
2006-07-21T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	well try the binary package from edgy then
2006-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	if it has dependencies, they need to be satisfied - no easy way around that.
2006-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	but it's update from 0.60 to 0.62, no ABI/API changes, it shouldn't have dependency change :(
2006-07-21T06:09:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	well, let me see
2006-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	the only real thing it adds beside of few bug fixes is QT bindings which are needed for me :(
2006-07-21T06:11:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	well apparently it needs libc6 2.4 rather than 2.3. that looks like quite a strong requirement
2006-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	where did you find it? So why ./configure is happy on my machine (Dapper?)
2006-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	e-gandalf	i'm talking about the *binary* package dependencies
2006-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	oh, ok.
2006-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	e-gandalf	LjL	I'll try with selfcompiling sources *^^*
