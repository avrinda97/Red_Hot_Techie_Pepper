2008-08-15T21:22:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		anyone ever heard of someone installing the i86 version on a 64bit computer and it booting and all that?
2008-08-15T21:23:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		I installed the normal Ubuntu on my computer, because there was no "AMD64" version, and it's buggy.
2008-08-15T21:23:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		or is Ubuntu just buggier than I thought?
2008-08-15T21:23:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		what?
2008-08-15T21:24:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		there was no CD for AMD64 or i86 or anything, just "Basic desktop", so I installed that on my AMD64 system, and it worked.
2008-08-15T21:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		so, does anyone know about this?
2008-08-15T21:26:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		is the only version of Ubuntu out there 32 bit?
2008-08-15T21:27:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		'cause I'm having alot of bugs... I know Ubuntu is buggier than most Linux builds, but this is more than I expected...
