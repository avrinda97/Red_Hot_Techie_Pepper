2007-01-04T08:18:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		I can connect to the router and the DHCP recognises me whenver I have encryption turned off. The second I turn on WEP, I put in the key, and it won't work.
2007-01-04T08:19:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		Make sure you install on the empty partition and all is well.
2007-01-04T08:21:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		So has anyone managed to get a wireless network working on Dapper with 128bit WEP?
2007-01-04T08:22:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	when you put in the key, try using "s:" in front; so if "password" is your key, try typing "s:password"
2007-01-04T08:22:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	that is of course if you're using a text key, which it sounds like you're not
2007-01-04T08:24:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	have you tried using iwconfig from the terminal?
2007-01-04T08:25:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	many times. I'm not sure whether I did it right though.
2007-01-04T08:25:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	'sudo iwconfig eth1 essid the-name-of-your-access-point key your-wep-key
2007-01-04T08:26:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	the above command usually does the trick for me
2007-01-04T08:26:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	On my router, I set the key by typing in a word, hit generate and it makes a hex string.
2007-01-04T08:27:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	not sure, but I think you'd need to put in the hex string
2007-01-04T08:28:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	but you could try 'sudo iwconfig eth1 essid the-name-of-your-access-point key s:the-word-you-used' which is faster
2007-01-04T08:35:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	no luck
2007-01-04T08:38:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	too bad :(
2007-01-04T08:39:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	you say that if you turn off wep, it works fine?
2007-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	in my router setup, I can choose to use ASCII or HEX mode encryption - if you have that option, try changing it?
2007-01-04T08:53:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	my understanding is that you should use the alternative cd for upgrades (rather than the live CD)
2007-01-04T08:54:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	easiest though is to upgrade via the Internet
2007-02-21T17:53:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	isn't the numbers in the corners the numbers you press on the numpad while holding ALT to get that character?
2007-02-21T17:54:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	could be... any idea how to get them to display as characters instead?
2007-02-21T17:54:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	NOt a clue.
2007-02-21T17:55:00.000Z	ndlovu	NoEvidenZ	:) too bad. does it display as a block on your screen or is there actually a character there?
2007-02-21T17:56:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	block, i think.
2007-02-21T17:57:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ	ndlovu	Oh, I'm in windows at the moment, so it's just a black square.
