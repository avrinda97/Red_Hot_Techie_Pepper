2011-04-30T00:53:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1		trying to install natty, but when i got to the partition thing, i can't set the mount point manually. any idea why?
2011-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	did you choose manual way or whatever it name is
2011-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	i chose erase ubuntu and then i clicked advance partitioning
2011-04-30T00:58:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	anything?
2011-04-30T00:59:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	you should see your partitions and decide on witch one you will install and mark partition as root and ext4
2011-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	i see all my partition. and i want to make new partition table from scratch. i'm planing to have root, /var, /cache, /cache1
2011-04-30T01:01:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	if you don´t have valuable files on them delete all partitions and start making new
2011-04-30T01:01:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	but when i want to make a mount point for the /cache and /cache1 i was unable to do so, due to the mount point option can't be manually edited
2011-04-30T01:02:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	i'm making a new partitionin...like i said
2011-04-30T01:02:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	why cache can you use media or something like that
2011-04-30T01:04:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	i can use any name for the new partition, but the problem is the installer won't let me type manually. i have to choose from the drop down list
2011-04-30T01:05:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	so choose whatever you want and don ´ know if you can type name manually
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	the options only "/", /boot /home, /tmp, /usr, /var, /srv, /opt, /usr/local can't i use other than that?
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	I don´t think so
2011-04-30T01:08:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	so if i need other partition name other than that, how can i do that?
2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	I really don´t know
2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	thanks
2011-04-30T01:11:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	sorry I was not much of help  :(
2011-04-30T01:13:00.000Z	a2c4n9e1	zvacet	come on... its okay, we're all learning here. perhaps someone else know about my problem
2011-04-30T01:14:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	tnx for comfort
2011-04-30T01:25:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	i know it is not what you want but reinstall 10.10 and make partition as you like after that install natty on root and do not format other just thout
2011-04-30T01:27:00.000Z	zvacet	a2c4n9e1	newest is nor always best that is why
