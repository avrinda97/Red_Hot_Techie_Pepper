2011-12-19T22:27:00.000Z	Atlantic777	iToast	I'm just trying to help a guy on some forum with some usb webmail notifier.
2011-12-19T22:28:00.000Z	Atlantic777	iToast	you just need to write status for led into that file and led will do that. :)

2011-12-19T22:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	iToast	I'v just found out that the usbled driver's is compiled as module, so you need to load it with this cmd: sudo modprobe usbled
2011-12-19T22:38:00.000Z	Atlantic777	iToast	try to google about that driver and play with config files.
