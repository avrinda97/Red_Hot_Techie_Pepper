2005-10-20T15:12:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	do you know about "apt-get build-dep"?
2005-10-20T15:12:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	nope.
2005-10-20T15:13:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	it installs the packages needed to build a package
2005-10-20T15:17:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	mail-notification knows what libs it wants - and apt-get build-dep will install them
2005-10-20T15:20:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	mail-notification needs: cdbs, debhelper (>= 4.1.87), scrollkeeper, gnome-pkg-tools, libxml-parser-perl, libglade2-dev (>= 2.6.0), libeel2-dev (>= 2.6.0), libbonobo-activation-dev (>= 2.4.0), libssl-dev (>= 0.9.5b), libsoup2.2-dev (>= 2.2.0), libsasl2-dev (>= 2.0.0), libgmime2.1-dev (>= 2.1.9), libicu28-dev
2005-10-20T15:21:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	I added the deb-src, and get: Could not open file /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_main_source_Sources - open (2 No such file or directory)
2005-10-20T15:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	did you "apt-get update"?
2005-10-20T15:22:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	of course, I could update. ;)
2005-10-20T15:23:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	after adding the deb-src you should "apt-get update" and the file you need should be downloaded
2005-10-20T15:23:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	yeap.
2005-10-20T15:23:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	and add "universe" in there, for mail-notification.
2005-10-20T15:24:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	just copy the existing 'deb' lines and change 'deb' to 'deb-src'
2005-10-20T15:25:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	it's all working. i'm sure this is in the apt-get man page, but man-o-man, if you've no idea it's in there, you don't think to look.
2005-10-20T15:25:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	right.  and even if you do, there's a bunch of other commands that you don't even know exist.  like dpkg-buildpackage for example
2005-10-20T15:27:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	hm. so perhaps this mail-notification source has the stuff needed to build a package?  oy.  not sure I'm up to that today.
2005-10-20T15:27:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	why are you building it anyway?
2005-10-20T15:28:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	I think there's a bug in the current breezy-universe mail-notification wrt gmail, plus no ssl for imap.
2005-10-20T15:28:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	it doesn't work with gmail, no.
2005-10-20T15:28:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	but the new version (tarball) does, which is what I'm compiling.  on my other machine, I had the gnome libs, apparently.
2005-10-20T15:29:00.000Z	dooglus	Tolstoy	did you run the 'apt build-dep mail-notification" thing yet?
2005-10-20T15:29:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	yeap.  worked like a charm.
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	finally!  I get my "mail notification: gmail message, 1 hour ago" . ;)
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	not that the gmail thing doesn't toss up an error once in a while.
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	Tolstoy	dooglus	or this coffee shop thing doesn't crap out.  if you see this, thanks for the help.
