2006-10-22T07:56:00.000Z	deadhobo1		Hya... I'm completley new to ubuntu and I just installed a nvidia driver through automatix2. I rebooted and it took a dump on me, the only thing that comes up after boot is a corrupted grey screen.
2006-10-22T07:57:00.000Z	deadhobo1		looks like #automatix is dead :(
2006-10-22T07:57:00.000Z	deadhobo1		I guess my real question is how to boot into a safe-mode of sorts
2006-10-22T07:59:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	no necessarily, but automatix is known to blindly install packages to the machine, even there is an error.
2006-10-22T08:01:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	try booting into single mode, can you ?
2006-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	how do I do that?
2006-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	if you can here the login sound meaning your system is not really screwed up I supposed, perhaps an X issue.
2006-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	while configuring xserver, try to use the standard driver and uncheck 'dri' and 'glx' modules.
2006-10-22T08:04:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	I don't know how to get to the xserver window... I'm going to try what LjL said real quick, thanks tho
2006-10-22T08:04:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	hold on
2006-10-22T08:05:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	to boot into single mode, on the GRUB menu, edit the line begins with /initrd (by pressing 'e') then append 'single'
2006-10-22T08:06:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	however, by default Ubuntu includes a 'recovery mode', you can just choose it.
2006-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	so just hit ESC on boot?
2006-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	when booting into single user mode......
2006-10-22T08:10:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	ok, thanks
2006-10-22T08:10:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	...you'll be welcomed with a text login screen, after logging in type 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2006-10-22T08:18:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	if you just pressed Enter then the configuration file wouldn't change a bit. You should try changing the driver to a standard driver ('ati' or 'nv')
2006-10-22T08:19:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	Ooh, I did read each prompt and answer accordingly, but I didn't realize nv is diffrent from nvidia
2006-10-22T08:20:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	will do, thank you for the help. One sec
2006-10-22T08:20:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	'nvidia' or 'fglrx' are for Nvidia 3D driver and ATI, respectively, that would be some hope.
2006-10-22T08:23:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	yepp. I'll also try to leave automatix alone now :p
2006-10-22T08:23:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	just be aware that you wouldn't get 3D support for that driver though.
2006-10-22T08:24:00.000Z	deadhobo1	fnf	Oh, so does that mean I can't run XGL?
2006-10-22T08:24:00.000Z	fnf	deadhobo1	probably, I'm not sure about xgl, but the nvidia driver is known to be unstable for me.
