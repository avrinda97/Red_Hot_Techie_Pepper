2008-03-06T06:19:00.000Z	kenro		Hey! Who you calling a posr?
2008-03-06T06:21:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	please stop
2008-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	Granted, due to my antipathy to typing, that didn't cum ot rite... I'll shut up.
2012-03-10T10:14:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	ubuntu-desktop package?
2012-03-10T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	what packages? ubuntu-desktop?
2012-03-10T10:17:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 Say what? All I know is it's the package listed with synaptic. Simply, gkrellm. perhaps you ask if I'm using ubuntu... yeah.
2012-03-10T10:18:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	ubuntu-desktop is perfectly safe to remove, its a meta package
2012-03-10T10:18:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	it does NOT remove the GNOME DE
2012-03-10T10:19:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 Ah right, transitional pkg? I know this. I also know synaptic wants to remove gnome, replace with a couple random kde libs.
2012-03-10T10:20:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	if you'd care to pastebin the list we can take a look at it
2012-03-10T10:22:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	Could be related to (yet unresolved) repo misconfig? gpg keys, et al...? Synaptic wants to remove gnome, but apt says 'deps unresolvable...
2012-03-10T10:23:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 I'll pastebin my sources.list?
2012-03-10T10:24:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	the package list when you try to install gkrellm would be better
2012-03-10T10:34:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	try installing the depends, first
2012-03-10T10:27:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	Paste from kenro at Sat, 10 Mar 2012 00:26:15 +0100     does this have what you need to find the paste?
2012-03-10T10:28:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	pastebin link?
2012-03-10T10:28:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/877060/ ?
2012-03-10T10:30:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	what about installing those depends first?
2012-03-10T10:31:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	http://paste.ubuntu.com/877072/
2012-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 Did. It will install gkrellm first. Falling back into the errors.
2012-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	bazhang	kenro	you have kde4 installed as well? sounds like a bug
2012-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 Oh! You mean with apt. not synaptic. Sorry. Will try. Also, yes I've had kde4 on here. Should be mostly, functionally, uninstalled, now, but I occasionally find residual kde libs...
2012-03-10T10:44:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	Fogive if intruding, but... still with me?
2012-03-10T10:47:00.000Z	kenro	bazhang	 Thanks for helping. Unfortunately, it remains unresolved. Perhaps there are alternatives...
