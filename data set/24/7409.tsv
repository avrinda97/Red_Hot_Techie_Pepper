2005-02-12T17:49:00.000Z	faxons		I'm trying to upgrade to hoary from warty and having some X problems
2005-02-12T17:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	lots of fun with Hoary + Xorg
2005-02-12T17:51:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	is there some docs on this that I missed?
2005-02-12T17:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	what problem are you having ?
2005-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	X just doesn't start
2005-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	startx brings up a session
2005-02-12T17:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	you can try xorgconfig
2005-02-12T17:53:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	I think it's a package problem
2005-02-12T17:53:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	it will walk you through setting up xorg. If there is an XF86Config-4 file in the X11 directory it seems to want to use that file for some reason.
2005-02-12T17:54:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	the live CD comes up fine and I "borrowed" the xorg.conf file
2005-02-12T17:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	did you dis-upgrade ?
2005-02-12T17:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	err dist-upgrade
2005-02-12T17:56:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	by running apt-get update with a faild dist-upgrade did I screw the install?
2005-02-12T17:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	that's probably what happened. Sometimes if it bombs out you just try again. try apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-02-12T17:58:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	apt-get update shows no packages to be updated
2005-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	same with dist-upgrade
2005-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	you did apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2005-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	yea
2005-02-12T17:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	well you can try xorgconfig
2005-02-12T06:00:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	k, I'll give it a shot
2005-02-12T06:04:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	is there a way to re-run the base install
2005-02-12T06:04:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	something like dpkg-reconfigrue base-config
2005-02-12T06:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	faxons	I dunno if that will work, one way to find out :D
2005-02-12T06:05:00.000Z	faxons	LinuxJones	is base-config the right option?
