2007-09-29T15:29:00.000Z	deardeath		there I'll fix it.
2007-09-29T05:07:00.000Z	deardeath		Greetings.
2007-09-29T05:07:00.000Z	deardeath		Can one of you help me out with something?
2007-09-29T05:07:00.000Z	deardeath		My internet speed is a lot slower whilst using ubuntu
2007-09-29T05:07:00.000Z	deardeath		Any idea why?
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	are you using dial-up?
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	deardeath		nope
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	deardeath		The thing is, while using windows xp I download files with 200kbps
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	USB?
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	deardeath		while on ubuntu, my download rate is around 20 kbps
2007-09-29T05:08:00.000Z	deardeath		It's a desktop computer, with lan connection.
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	deardeath		not wireless.
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	deardeath		Connected to the modem over lan
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	Ethernet?
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	deardeath		Yup
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	deardeath		Another thing I noticed is, it takes a bit more time to resolve dns of hostnames.
2007-09-29T05:09:00.000Z	deardeath		like 40 seconds or something like that
2007-09-29T05:10:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	is your ethernet card a giagbit connection?
2007-09-29T05:10:00.000Z	deardeath		Yup
2007-09-29T05:10:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	*gigabit
2007-09-29T05:10:00.000Z	deardeath		I don't believe it's because of something my ethernet card offers, it has got to do with Ubuntu hence the difference between Windows and Ubuntu is a bit lot.
2007-09-29T05:11:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	yeah, ubuntu has problems with gigabit ethernet cards. they even loose connection after a while and requires a restart :(
2007-09-29T05:11:00.000Z	deardeath	Keitaro	 Any solutions?
2007-09-29T05:11:00.000Z	Keitaro	deardeath	i suggest getting the latest ethernet drivers for Linux and insalling them
