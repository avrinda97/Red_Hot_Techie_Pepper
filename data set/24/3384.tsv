2008-03-16T03:14:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I am told that the login failed.
2008-03-16T03:18:00.000Z	amenado	marion	get on the terminal of the ubuntu, then ssh localhost and see if you get any responses
2008-03-16T03:26:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I just did a login with ssh on the localhost. It worked great!
2008-03-16T03:27:00.000Z	amenado	marion	good, you used localhost?  now try the ip address
2008-03-16T03:30:00.000Z	amenado	marion	what is the ip address of your laptop? your desktop?
2008-03-16T03:31:00.000Z	marion	amenado	how do I find the IP address in Ubuntu.
2008-03-16T03:31:00.000Z	amenado	marion	 ifconfig
2008-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	amenado	marion	what is the ip address of your laptop? your desktop?
2008-03-16T03:34:00.000Z	marion	amenado	laptop = 192.168.1.102, desktop = 192.168.1.100
2008-03-16T03:37:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I can ssh using the IP address.
2008-03-16T03:38:00.000Z	amenado	marion	now from laptop try same  ssh 192.168.1.100
2008-03-16T03:39:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I am using DHCP so the IP address might change.
2008-03-16T03:40:00.000Z	amenado	marion	so what if it changes? what is the exact issue?
2008-03-16T03:42:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I want to create a desktop shortcut that will use the computer name so I can connect even if the IP address changes.
2008-03-16T03:43:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I do only have 3 computers on my network.
2008-03-16T03:44:00.000Z	amenado	marion	tree to ten is in-significant, have the ip address .100 to .110 point to same pc host
2008-03-16T03:44:00.000Z	amenado	marion	modify your /etc/hosts
2008-03-16T03:44:00.000Z	amenado	marion	modify your /etc/hosts of your laptop..
2008-03-16T03:46:00.000Z	marion	amenado	so i can point a range of IP address to a single name?
2008-03-16T03:46:00.000Z	amenado	marion	yes it is possible
2008-03-16T03:48:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I use DHCP because I want the laptop to be able to connect to different wifi networks. What might happen if I switch to a static IP network?
2008-03-16T03:50:00.000Z	amenado	marion	anytime, come again and share your know how once you get good at it
2008-03-16T03:50:00.000Z	marion	amenado	I hope to be able to do that some day.
2008-03-16T03:51:00.000Z	amenado	marion	ahh you will, if you are persistent
