2008-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	Norrz		hi? any help plz? after re-installing windows, i lost the grub loader. and what i tried is to enter the demo version, uninstall grub from the synaptic manager, then trying to install again, which gave me an error. so what could be the solution?
2008-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	first link there will get you all set up
2008-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	my ubuntu is installed on the most free space disk, and not on a certain created disk.
2008-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	That's fine.  It's installed somewhere, and that first link will reinstall GRUB for you, after windows wiped it out.
2008-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	i tried this method. always giving me cannot mount root. :S
2008-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	Then you're probably giving it the wrong partition numbers.
2008-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	the command is always (hd0,X), where X is the variable ?
2008-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	No, its hdX,Y where X is the harddrive number and Y is the partition number.  (both are 0 indexed)
2008-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	if this is all I have /dev/hda1, how can you identify the X and the Y?
2008-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	alright, the a b c (hda hdb hdc, etc) are the disk numbers, a is the first, b second etc.  In GRUB-speak, we're zero indexed, so hda is hd0, hdb is hd1, etc.  As for partitions, hda1 is hd0,0 (because we're zero based), hda2 is hd0,1, etc.
2008-08-31T05:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	If you only have one partition, how are you dual booting?
2008-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	No I have 2 partitions. One is for windows, the other is for my data. When I first intsalled Ubuntu, I did partition a disk for it, but on the installation It didn't read it! and I didn't know how to deal with it, so I have been told to free some space, and choose the option to install on the most free space.
2008-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	but last time I was formatting my C ( windows ) I saw that there's also a 3rd partition in the formatting manager of XP. But if I go to my computer, I have ONLY 2 partitios..don't know much bout that.
2008-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	Its entirely likely that windows won't see ext3 partitions
2008-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	Aha I see, well I don't know much about these stuff ;) so excuse my iggnorance.
2008-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	that's fine. So, you had two partitions (data and windows) and now you're reinstalling Ubuntu?
2008-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	I had ( data and windows ) and then I installed ubuntu using the most free space option. And I used ubuntu for a while, then I had to reinstall XP. and after that, grub was gone.
2008-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	did you overwrite Ubuntu with windows then? or are you sure all of your partitions are still there?  If you fire up a liveCD, you should be able to see all three.
2008-08-31T05:16:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	I am sure all I formatted is my C ( windows location, 43.5 GB ) - and as I have told you earlier, while I was doing that, I did recognize a third partition cant' remmeber the Letter, of the size Ubuntu.
2008-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	Alright, that makes sense (the partitioner would see it as a partition, Windows explorer wont).  The instructions on that wiki page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#Overwriting%20the%20Windows%20bootloader  should get you all set up
2008-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	Okay mate thanks for your help. And uh? last question ( new ubuntu user here ) - it more likely that you have to reinsatll your OS like in Windows? that dies after 2/3 months :P.
2008-08-31T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Norrz	No, you won't need to.  I've been running a single ubuntu install for over two years now.
2008-08-31T05:19:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	I see, that tells much about the constancy. Anyway, gonna run the Live CD and try what you gave ;). Thanks for your help...!
2008-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	Norrz	Flannel	Thanks mate. It worked ;) - But I want to ask you something, and this happened even before I reinstalled XP. On the Grub loader I have 2 Ubuntu, and 2 Ubuntu Recovery, and 1 Ubuntu xxxx.x :P and sure the XP. My Ubuntu display doubled once BEFORE when I added new rams to my desktop ( Or I am wrong ). But anyway...how can I get to fix that?
