2012-09-22T07:13:00.000Z	Dr0p3D		l3top... i think i'll just wait for someone to reply in the forums hence you cant seem to understand pastebin urls too well... for christ sakes! http://paste.ubuntu.com/1219814/

2012-09-22T07:13:00.000Z	Dr0p3D		its all pasted right into the pastebin that ubuntu supplies!
2012-09-22T07:14:00.000Z	Dr0p3D		to not want to click on the specific url is a lame reason.

2012-09-22T07:18:00.000Z	jrib	Dr0p3D	stop repeating please.  It's helpful to describe your issue succinctly and then include the link at the end.  That way people that have no idea about certain areas don't have to go chase down links to discover they can't help.  Something like "I'm receiving apt-get errors, here they are: ..." would be great.  Now let's all get back to support please :)
2012-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	Dr0p3D	you should pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list as well as /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
2012-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	Dr0p3D	jrib	 here is what your requesting.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1219832/
2012-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	jrib	Dr0p3D	well you didn't paste the contents of the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ but you should start by removing the duplicates of medibuntu (you have medibuntu already in /etc/apt/sources.list and you seem to have it again in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list)

2012-09-22T07:43:00.000Z	jrib	Dr0p3D	just copy and paste the command I ask you about
