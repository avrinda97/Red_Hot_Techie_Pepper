2008-04-01T14:17:00.000Z	NetUser_1		i cannot boot my pc(grub error and a god knows what else-non fixable-) is there any way to learn my email passwords stored in pigdin through live cd?
2008-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	NetUser_1		TheOneAndOnly:how?
2008-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	yes, you can use the live cd and then mount the drive with your home directory on it, then find the .purple folder, which contains all your pidgin passwords
2008-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	if you need any help with that, we're very happy to provide more specifics :)
2008-04-01T14:18:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	probably i'll need it ...
2008-04-01T14:19:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	sure.  first, boot the cd and tell us when you get there :)
2008-04-01T14:20:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	unfortunately i dont have my pc with me right now....
2008-04-01T14:21:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	how do i mount and which directory specific?
2008-04-01T14:21:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	there should be some drives listed on the desktop, click on them until you find one that has a /home folder in it
2008-04-01T14:22:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	click the home folder, then click your username
2008-04-01T14:23:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	you'll have to enable hidden folders (press ctrl+h in the file browser) and then find the folder called .purple
2008-04-01T14:23:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	and then (i am a bit newbe...)
2008-04-01T14:23:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	then you'll want to find the file called accounts.xml
2008-04-01T14:24:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	double click it, and you'll see a bunch of stuff -- I think you can probably figure out what your passwords are (they'll be in something like <password>mysupersecretpassword</password>
2008-04-01T14:26:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	that should be it; if you have any more questions about it, feel free to ask :)
2008-04-01T14:28:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	since you're on the livecd, you shouldn't
2008-04-01T14:29:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	if you do for some reason though, you can run gksudo nautilus in the terminal, which will get you a root file browser
2008-04-01T14:34:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	...and so the drive icons are the file manager...and since i find the accounts.xml i just "find" the word password.but won't they be encrypted or something?
2008-04-01T14:35:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	they can't be encrypted, otherwise you'd have to type a password in every time you wanted to login to your accounts
2008-04-01T14:37:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	...propably so it just works like a common text file,no other worries?
2008-04-01T14:37:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	yep
2008-04-01T14:37:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	if you find the file, you're all set
2008-04-01T14:37:00.000Z	NetUser_1	compwiz18	you are a life savor thnx!
2008-04-01T14:38:00.000Z	compwiz18	NetUser_1	good luck and hope that works for you :)
