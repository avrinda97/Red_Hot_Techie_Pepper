2007-09-13T16:32:00.000Z	NMajik		How can I determine what wireless driver I am using for a given card?
2007-09-13T16:33:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	try a 'dmesg | grep INTERFACE_NAME'
2007-09-13T16:34:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	I see "NDIS driver: oem32" in one of the lines. Can I assume the driver name is oem32?
2007-09-13T16:35:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	uh.. yikes... well, i think that implies that your driver is something called ndiswrapper, which wraps windows drivers... so, presumably, it's ndiswrapper wrapping oem32.inf, or something like that.
2007-09-13T16:37:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	So there's no way to tell? Or were you being sarcastic?
2007-09-13T16:37:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	i'm sure there's a way to tell, but i don't use ndiswrapper, so i don't know it off the top of my head.
2007-09-13T16:37:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	OK, thanks for the help
2007-09-13T16:38:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	try "ndiswrapper -l" in a terminal
2007-09-13T16:39:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	Among other things "oem32 : driver installed"
2007-09-13T16:39:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	try 'locate oem32'
2007-09-13T16:40:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37275/
2007-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	"ar5523.sys" looks interesting
2007-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	lmao at "/home/nmajik/Desktop/New WIFI junk. Delete if working/oem32.inf"
2007-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	After pasting that, I thought you might be amused
2007-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	Well, the stuff in Desktop/New\ WIFI* is probably what you installed.
2007-09-13T16:43:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	that makes it sound as though you intentionally installed the 'oem32.inf' driver using ndiswrapper from that directory.
2007-09-13T16:44:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	Absolutely, I just don't know what ubuntu is calling it now
2007-09-13T16:44:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	what do you mean, what ubuntu is calling it?  what do you think you need to know the driver name for?  :)
2007-09-13T16:45:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	I'm trying to set up kismet but I'm getting the feeling I might have to go with a different driver
2007-09-13T16:45:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	I'm not encouraged though... my card sounds like a very uncommon chipset
2007-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	Well, not "very"
2007-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	well, you probably don't need to tell kismet the name of the underlying driver ndiswrapper is using.  if you get it working, it will be by using the 'ndiswrapper' driver, or something like that.  :)
2007-09-13T16:48:00.000Z	NMajik	godlygeek	Well, I guess that ends my search. Thanks for your help
2007-09-13T16:48:00.000Z	godlygeek	NMajik	no problem.
