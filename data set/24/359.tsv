2011-11-05T02:37:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	you added 2 drive to a drive that had ubuntu on it and you want to use all 3 in a raid?
2011-11-05T02:38:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	nop
2011-11-05T02:38:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	ok so you just have 3 more drives and want to raid?
2011-11-05T02:38:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	3x160gb raid 0, 1hdd of 500gb ubuntu installed. need to transfer from 500gb to raid config
2011-11-05T02:39:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	the data or the whole install?
2011-11-05T02:39:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	whole install
2011-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	you cant just copy grub to a diff hdd especially a raid
2011-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	i thought so
2011-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	you have to install it and figure out how to get the bios to regognise your /boot partition
2011-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	i am making a fresh same version install on raid
2011-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	on my NAS with raid i just have another drive for the os so that i dont have to fuss with that and then backup that drive to the raid
2011-11-05T02:42:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	after new install i will try to overwrite
2011-11-05T02:43:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	what do you suggest about using a memory stick as swap?
2011-11-05T02:44:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	you can put swap on raid, the memory stick will get worn out quickly
2011-11-05T02:44:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	agreed
2011-11-05T02:46:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	i think i have it on the small drive with /
2011-11-05T02:46:00.000Z	riffautae	api984	if you have enough ram the swap wont matter much
2011-11-05T02:47:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	low ram
2011-11-05T02:47:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	i put one old module today making it 3gb ram
2011-11-05T02:47:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	2gb not enough
2011-11-05T02:48:00.000Z	api984	riffautae	pc slows down when ram usage is over 90%, starts blocking, swapping.....
