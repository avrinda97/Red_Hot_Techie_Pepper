2011-11-15T00:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	That is very odd. Did you use automatic or manual partitioning in the installer?
2011-11-15T00:46:00.000Z	tpyo	Jordan_U_bak	automatic
2011-11-15T00:46:00.000Z	tpyo	Jordan_U_bak	what is odd?
2011-11-15T00:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Yes, that's the important set of lines.
2011-11-15T00:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Do you still have that chroot set up?
2011-11-15T00:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Correct.
2011-11-15T00:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Please do.
2011-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Yes, but first I'd like to try to debug what went wrong during the install.
2011-11-15T00:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Can you run "debconf-show grub-pc" from within the chroot and pastebin the output?
2011-11-15T01:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	So it looks like Ubuntu's installer did install grub somewhere, but it may have been to a memory card rather than the internal drive. Can you pastebin the output of "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/"?
2011-11-15T01:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Either way will give the same result.
2011-11-15T01:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	I think it didn't show up in the boot info script output due to some bug in bootinfo script.
2011-11-15T01:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Yes, but that's not neccessary.
2011-11-15T01:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	If your BIOS can boot from SD card you should be able to boot your Ubuntu install by selecting the SD card as the boot device. But that's not really important. To get grub installed to your internal drive instead go back to the chroot and run "dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc".
2011-11-15T01:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	That command will ask you some questions, if I remember correctly the first two will be about kernel parameters. Leave those two at their defaults (which may be blank) and continue on to the "install devices" question. At that question you should have the opportunity to uncheck your memory card as an install device and check your internal drive instead. To select / deselect a device use space bar, press enter when you're do
2011-11-15T01:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Never a partition like sda1. Give me a second to look over the logs to see which is your internal drive.
2011-11-15T01:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	sda is your internal drive. sdb is the USB drive.
2011-11-15T01:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	No.
2011-11-15T01:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Remember that it's space bar to select and deselect, *not* Enter.
2011-11-15T01:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Common mistake :)
2011-11-15T01:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	You should be done now then. Try rebooting.
2011-11-15T01:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	You're welcome. And I would disagree that this was a problem of your own creation. Ubuntu's installer shouldn't have installed grub to your SD card, and I plan to file a bug report about it.
2011-11-15T01:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	tpyo	Indeed :)
