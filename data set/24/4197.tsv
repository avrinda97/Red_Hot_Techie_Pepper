2008-01-30T23:10:00.000Z	The_entropy		so I didn't want to take the chance
2008-01-30T23:10:00.000Z	The_entropy		I guess I'll try it in a couple of days though, I'll be home for a while once I'm done with my finals
2008-01-30T23:11:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	reliable it is (as long as you're running ubuntu packages, not crappy 3d party packages), reverseable not
2008-01-30T23:11:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	donald_ well I guess I'll try it then
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	I have some things built from source installed, though I made them into debs so they should be easy to remove from the package manager should they give trouble
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	did you use envy? or automatix? If so, upgrade is unreliable. Disable any 3d party repos, and probably you should remove any third party stuff you have installed
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	remove them first
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	would something like exaile give trouble?
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	and no I don't use envy or automatix
2008-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	nearly every case where people have problems have to do with poorly made debs, and checkinstall is notorious for it
2008-01-30T23:13:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	not poorly made deb, built using dpkg-buildpackage using a debian/ directory provided with the source(not self made or anything)
2008-01-30T23:13:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	looked pretty good
2008-01-30T23:14:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	ah, sounds much better :) but I personally would remove it, ymmv
2008-01-30T23:15:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	I have 1700 packages installed, is there any way to filter them to see which ones were not from the ubuntu repos?
2008-01-30T23:16:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	(using synaptic, but wouldn't mind using the terminal if needed)
2008-01-30T23:16:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	remove any sources other than ubuntu from sources.list , update, then check the Installed (local or obsolete) under the status button
2008-01-30T23:16:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	okay, cool
2008-01-30T23:18:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	hmmm 23 packages in there, once I've upgraded it'd be safe to reinclude those sources and reinstall, right?
2008-01-30T23:19:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	I'd give it a case by case thing, some might be in the newer release.
2008-01-30T23:20:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	hmmm, well there's only a couple of them I need, others I installed at the time but don't need anymore
2008-01-30T23:20:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	but thats the right procedure, cutting back to ubuntu, upgrading then adding the outside again. Be sure to check for the proper release from the outside as well
2008-01-30T23:20:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	and most of those packages I manually installed because I wanted newer versions than the repos
2008-01-30T23:20:00.000Z	The_entropy	nickrud	chances are they'll just be there
2008-01-30T23:21:00.000Z	nickrud	The_entropy	true, and you obviously know how to re-add safely
