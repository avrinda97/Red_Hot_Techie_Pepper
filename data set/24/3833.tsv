2008-09-20T08:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	how did you install flash for that
2008-09-20T08:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	also there are likely conflicts with all those extra repos
2008-09-20T08:18:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	downloaded it manually
2008-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	only additional ones enabled are boxee and dropbox
2008-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	Ashex		the rest are disabled
2008-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	how was that sources.list generated ##added by software properties ?
2008-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	but you installed from them right?
2008-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	Ashex		the top portion was by adept manager, the rest I do manually
2008-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	yes
2008-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	the odd repos, miro are the main culprits, possibly flash install as well.
2008-09-20T08:21:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	I've disabled miro. I don't see how flash would affect system performance since I don't have a browser running all the time
2008-09-20T08:21:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	thought you said ff performance was an issue
2008-09-20T08:22:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	it was one of them
2008-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	how old is this install
2008-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	it was more overall system is just a bit sluggish when opening apps/documents
2008-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	about 4 months
2008-09-20T08:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Ashex	in future you may wish to have a separate home /partition ( !home )
2008-09-20T08:24:00.000Z	Ashex	bazhang	I do
2008-09-20T08:24:00.000Z	Ashex		I've got it on a seperate disk
2008-09-20T08:24:00.000Z	Ashex		I have it configured to one disk with seperate /boot and /, then another with /home, and another that is /media/big with all my media
