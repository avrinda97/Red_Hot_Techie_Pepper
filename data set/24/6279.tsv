2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	pestilence		it was a while ago.  and i did have ubuntu on this mahcine at one point
2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	it says kubuntu even if you use the ubuntu cd and install kde, so that doesn't tell anything one way or the other
2006-09-01T08:40:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	paradizelost ok, fine, but i am pretty sure i installed with a kubuntu cd ;)
2006-09-01T09:37:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	multiverse
2006-09-01T09:29:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	that is not true.
2006-09-01T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	yes, that is.  try it.
2006-09-01T09:29:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	root can remove anything.
2006-09-01T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	no
2006-09-01T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	look at the specs
2006-09-01T09:30:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	i can tell you from personal experience, this is completely untrue
2006-09-01T09:30:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	on ubuntu, with superuser priveleges, you should be able to remove anything.
2006-09-01T09:31:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	no.  it was a major change when posix came out.  read it.
2006-09-01T09:31:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	take me to the water, i'll drink
2006-09-01T09:31:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	really, check the posix check
2006-09-01T09:31:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	absolutely, because root owns /
2006-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	but not all subdirectories
2006-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	true, but that's not what I said
2006-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	I said that the problem we are talking about, he will never be able to erase because of the ownership
2006-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	well, on the default ubuntu system, root ALWAYS owns /
2006-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	maybe i missed something.
2006-09-01T09:34:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	if this were #posix, i might agree with you.  but this is #ubuntu which uses bash, and perhaps violates some posix spec.  but root can rm -rf / and it will wipe everyhing, read-only or no
2006-09-01T09:35:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	I don't use bash, I'll have to check it.  bash has awful compliance
2006-09-01T09:35:00.000Z	pestilence	sethk	that may be, but ubuntu defaults to bash.  so almost everyone here uses it ;)
2006-09-01T09:37:00.000Z	sethk	pestilence	thanks
