2007-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	d_root		anyone familiar with Twinview can help out?
2007-05-31T14:50:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	its best just to ask your question about twinview, maybe someone knows the answer but doesn't call him/herself experienced
2007-05-31T14:54:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	whats the maximum resolution of the monitors?
2007-05-31T14:55:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	both?
2007-05-31T14:55:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	1440x900, they're cheapos. yes
2007-05-31T14:55:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	they're both WXGA LCDs
2007-05-31T14:56:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	weird, i have a similar problem with my tv out with both twinview an d clone
2007-05-31T14:57:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	i hope someone knows it (but it isn't much of a problem for me here)
2007-05-31T14:57:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	if you get no answer you should check #nvidia
2007-05-31T14:57:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	i'll try that
2007-05-31T14:58:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	i've tried setting up using only Xinerama, but didnt achieve better results that way either
2007-05-31T14:58:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	they gave me great help there before
2007-05-31T14:58:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	what is Xinerama?
2007-05-31T14:59:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	it's similar to Twinview, but more universal, not limited to only nvidia drivers
2007-05-31T15:00:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	aha good to remember
2007-05-31T15:00:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	i think Twinview is better if you have an nvidia card
2007-05-31T15:00:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	i know, but its nice to remembe for other cards :-)
2007-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	for sure.
2007-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	do u by any chance know if its possible to do twinview on 3 screens? (one TV)
2007-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	i'm not sure, i'll bet someone has done it though. this is a good resource for multi-display stuff: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174
2007-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	i was just curious, thanx for the link
2007-05-31T15:05:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	i think there are hardware limitation to do that though (3 screens)
2007-05-31T15:06:00.000Z	d_root	ward_	you might be right, i think Xinerama is the way to go for more than 2 monitors
2007-05-31T15:07:00.000Z	ward_	d_root	yeah, one screen for the CPU :p
