2006-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	tortoise		how can i install ubuntu on a computer that will not boot from cd? I have looked around the 'net , but nothing has worked so far :(
2006-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	tortoise		all i have is a USB cd and the bios wont boot from usb or cd.
2006-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	update your BIOS
2006-02-24T07:03:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	i have the latest bios
2006-02-24T07:04:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	and it can boot up winxp install cd fine?
2006-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	just a curious factor that maybe either the burn wasn't successful and/or the drive is very picky
2006-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	, he made some sort of special boot disk or something
2006-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	uh huh.. that you may have a fair bit of issues with
2006-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	I assume so, if your friend did that, then yes, however it would be a bit of a pain to try and get it from floppy to read it via cdrom
2006-02-24T07:07:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	I mean in such a way that floppy is to be used to boot the cdrom
2006-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	yeah, your choice seems to be somewhat very limited there, I assume you don't have built-in cdrom?
2006-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	not built in, it is a tablet
2006-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	well I don't know, your choices seems very very bleak, the only way I can see out is to write to the manufacturer asking for better support I suppose?
2006-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	i loathe the manufacturer for doing this
2006-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	my friend had created a boot floppy that enabled the usb cdrom, is there no way i can use something like that with ubuntu?
2006-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	unfortunately, that's what you get with pre-built equipments, unless if you are daring to go for various other hacks that maybe floating around and if not lucky may cause your tablet to no longer operate
2006-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	you said before that it didn't work
2006-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	i said that what I tried didnt work, my friend got it to work
2006-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	well.. I wonder what sort of options you get when you load up the floppy from there
2006-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	i am not a computer guru, all i know is , this computer only will boot from HDD or floppy.
2006-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	I suppose you can try it again, if it does not work, try to talk to your friend about it. I presume in worst case scenario, where he only knows how to do it for windows, then you maybe stuck with having to poke around again
2006-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	i know that he got the computer to boot from floppy able to see the usb cd rom, then he just started XP setup...but i dont know how to do the boot disk
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	tortoise	there are guides for it on the internet, I think bootdisk.com is one
2006-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	tortoise	hatake_kakashi	thanks i will look
