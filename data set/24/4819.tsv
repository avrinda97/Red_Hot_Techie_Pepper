2007-01-04T10:20:00.000Z	Aggort		lol ok
2007-01-04T10:20:00.000Z	Aggort		Alright, well I want to install this thing
2007-01-04T10:20:00.000Z	Aggort		lol
2007-01-04T10:21:00.000Z	Aggort		So is it necessary to defragment my PC first?
2007-01-04T10:21:00.000Z	Aggort		The guides I read said to
2007-01-04T10:21:00.000Z	Aggort		Well I can create the partition via the install can't I?
2007-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	Aggort		See I had an issue with this before. When I installed Ubuntu it didn't work and I ended up losing everything on Windows!
2007-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	Aggort		Well can't I create a free partition?
2007-01-04T10:22:00.000Z	Aggort		with the install?
2007-01-04T10:23:00.000Z	Aggort		oh
2007-01-04T10:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	Ice_Wewe No, you can resize and create partitions from the install, you can have the installer do it automatically even
2007-01-04T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	If you have unpartitioned space then all you need to do is make a new partition for Ubuntu ( you can do this from the installer )
2007-01-04T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	IMHO parted is more reliable than any other partitioner
2007-01-04T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	You can never guarentee that but yes, run chkdisk ( or whatever the command is in windows ) first because rezising an already corrupted partition will obviously lead to bad things :)
2007-01-04T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	Just use Gparted
2007-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	Aggort	Jordan_U	What if it ruins my NTFS and thus ruinign Windows?
2007-01-04T11:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	Then you restore from your backup :)
2007-01-04T11:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	There is no program which will guaretntee resizing won't F*** things up, not even partition magic
2007-01-04T11:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	pretty much
2007-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	People who don't know about FOSS buy partition magic
2007-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	Either using the gparted LiveCD http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php Or just follow the instructions when you install Ubuntu ( ubuntu uses gparted )
2007-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	you need to reboot
2007-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	Why?
2007-01-04T12:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aggort	It is safest to resize partitions when they are unmounted, If you are booted off of it it is kind of hrd to unmount it :)
