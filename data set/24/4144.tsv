2007-10-09T06:19:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		do you guys know how the xorg.conf file works in detail?
2007-10-09T06:20:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i know my monitor can operate at 70Hz when in 1280x960 mode
2007-10-09T06:20:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		can i modify it in a way so that it operates at 70Hz?
2007-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		can i test to launch my own xorg.conf without reboot and overwrite the original one?
2007-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've named it xorg.conf.foo and just wanna try it out before i overwrite original
2007-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	you can tell X to use a specific conf file, hang on
2007-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	Xorg -config xorg.conf.foo
2007-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	will it boot with that one only this time then?
2007-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	yes, just that one time you run that command
2007-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	of course assuming X isn't already running, unless you want to start another server on another display
2007-10-09T06:25:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	ah
2007-10-09T06:26:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	gdm?
2007-10-09T06:26:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	yeah
2007-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	was it Xorg -config xorg.conf.foo
2007-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	yeah
2007-10-09T06:32:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	i assume the "xorg.conf.foo" file actually existed, in that directory
2007-10-09T06:33:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	ok, it must be located in /etc/X11 ?
2007-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	btw, the Xorg command alone didn't even work but when i typed startx it immediately launched me back
2007-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	so Xorg didn't even launch a root screen?
2007-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	nope
2007-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	only a fatal error message
2007-10-09T06:36:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Daverocks	about some other log file i think
2007-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	...more detail? (don't paste in here btw)
2007-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	Daverocks	Bo^Dick	k
