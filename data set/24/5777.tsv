2009-04-28T08:29:00.000Z	gogeta	atomx	well worst case you use ndiswrapper and the windows driver
2009-04-28T08:33:00.000Z	gogeta	atomx	well we would need to knoe your chipset so weather its madwifi or nds you need
2009-04-28T08:35:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	how do i find that?
2009-04-28T08:35:00.000Z	gogeta	atomx	lspci

2009-04-28T08:36:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	yeah i know, :P I just have no idea what line it is I would assume that one...
2009-04-28T08:36:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	yeah it's intel atom 1.6ghz hyperthreaded
2009-04-28T08:38:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	The website said it works right out of box with my netbook, so i would assume it does, but I can't find anything with it, although I can find it fine with my windows netbook and my hackentosh netbook
2009-04-28T08:38:00.000Z	gogeta	atomx	well did you find your chipset
2009-04-28T08:39:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	I put in lspci and I have no idea which line it is, nothing says anything about chipset
2009-04-28T08:41:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	it has my sound, video, wireless, lan, sound, usb, memory, but nothing about a chipset
2009-04-28T08:41:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	945GSE
2009-04-28T08:42:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	it's easier for me to find everything I need on the one with mac os x and I have never used it till today lol

2009-04-28T08:43:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	That's the one for the wireless
2009-04-28T08:44:00.000Z	gogeta	atomx	they work but there slow i suggest getting nids and using the windows driver
2009-04-28T08:45:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	ok I will look into that, can you give a link perhaps?
2009-04-28T08:46:00.000Z	atomx	gogeta	no for nids
