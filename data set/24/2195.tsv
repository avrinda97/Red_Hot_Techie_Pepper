2010-04-30T18:53:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	are you running ubuntu desktop on that server?
2010-04-30T18:54:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	If I recall correctly it was a simple base system install via FTP at the beginning.
2010-04-30T18:55:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	There is no X server running whatsoever if that's what you mean. CLI only.
2010-04-30T18:56:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	you'll have to check the logs why it wont continue to boot
2010-04-30T18:57:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	As I already mentioned, there are no logs. All logs where last edited shortly before the restart after the update. Logging doesn't seem to have started where the system is crashin already.
2010-04-30T19:01:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	any other errors on the screen ?
2010-04-30T19:02:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	I don't have physical access to the screen and that was the only message that was given to me.
2010-04-30T19:02:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	bit hard to deduce from there what is wrong :/
2010-04-30T19:03:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	Yes, as you can imagine I'm rather clueless on how to solve this problem without any logs or physical access to the screen.
2010-04-30T19:03:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	seems impossible without physical access, anyway i thought plymouth was a gui thing, so it seems odd that aserver gives errors regarding it failing to start
2010-04-30T19:04:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	As far as I know plymouth is the splash screen during boot. So I tried booting with nosplash (I'm still using legacy grub by the way). That didn't help either, though.
2010-04-30T19:07:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	yeah but why ubuntu-server would use a splashscreen even is beyond me
2010-04-30T19:08:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	I have no idea.
2010-04-30T19:08:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	anyway its really hard for anyone to help you without you being able to try commands to do basic troubleshooting, either have a livecd booted with a shell started so you can get access at least or you'll have to go over there to get things fixed
2010-04-30T19:09:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	Well, I have access to a rescue shell and can completely chroot into the system with that. So far that didn't really help me, though.
2010-04-30T19:10:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	well i'd start in syslog and dmesg to see what went wrong
2010-04-30T19:10:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	Empty, as I said.
2010-04-30T19:10:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	it gives a reason during boot why it drops to the rescue shell
2010-04-30T19:11:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	No, don't get me wrong. I activated to a rescue shell manually, provided by the server provider.
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	The server itself doesn't boot from the HD. You get a ping reply but nothing more. No logs at all.
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	then i just dont understand
2010-04-30T19:12:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	Then you're as far as I am ;)
2010-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	IceBear	acicula	If I got it right, plymouth is essential to Ubuntu and you can't even seem to remove it without destroying the whole system.
2010-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	acicula	IceBear	i see, it must be something else then
