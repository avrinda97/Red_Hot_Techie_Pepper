2007-02-17T10:19:00.000Z	Norrit		Francois: yes it works in windows, didnt check sys reqs, and feel kind of stupid for that. its a 366 Celeron, 32 meg ram, 4 gig hd, figured that was enough
2007-02-17T10:20:00.000Z	Norrit		Francois: what is the ram req? i might have some old SD layin around
2007-02-17T10:20:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	recommended to have 128, anyhting less is rediculous
2007-02-17T09:59:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	go ahead
2007-02-17T10:01:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	say my name before you type to me, it'll help my reading :)
2007-02-17T10:01:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	ok, so is the hard drive good ? does it run ?
2007-02-17T10:03:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	yeah it should be hda,
2007-02-17T10:03:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	so windows is already installed, did you let the ubuntu installer partition the drive automatically ?
2007-02-17T10:04:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	does the error apear on your hard drive ? or on the cd ? because you can check hte cd, before you install it
2007-02-17T10:05:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	does the cd run in windows ? it should be able to launch an app with things you can install
2007-02-17T10:07:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	yeah, the cd might be dirty, which version do you have ?
2007-02-17T10:08:00.000Z	Norrit	francois	bah, 6.06 rather.
2007-02-17T10:08:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	ok, where theres 6.10, so you can either try installing the old version, and then updating if you want to, or just burn the latest....
2007-02-17T10:13:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	ok, so whats the exact error ?
2007-02-17T10:15:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	what kind of machine are you running this on ? i need to understand what hdc is,
2007-02-17T10:17:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	ok, did you check to see if the computer meets requirements ? and the cd rom works because you ran it in windows right ?
2007-02-17T10:19:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	not enough ram, you might want to install the alternate cd, and then install a desktop,
2007-02-17T10:22:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	the graphic components require a lot,
2007-02-17T10:22:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	if you just run and use the command line then its ok
2007-02-17T10:22:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	but otherwise get the alternate cd install
2007-02-17T10:23:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	a seperate version of ubuntu for older computers, without all the extra stuff,
2007-02-17T10:24:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	np, but i didn't really fix anything lol
2007-02-17T10:27:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	woah, thats harsh, must of been slow as hell
2007-02-17T10:28:00.000Z	francois	Norrit	X is hard on ram, not so much ubuntu
