2011-11-02T10:17:00.000Z	Parsi		how can I remove installed opencv 2.2 from 11.04 ?
2011-11-02T10:18:00.000Z	Parsi		I want to install new version
2011-11-02T10:18:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	sudo dpkg --purge <packagename>
2011-11-02T10:20:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	I compiled it myself, does it matter? It's opencv
2011-11-02T10:20:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	how did you install it?  make file?
2011-11-02T10:20:00.000Z	Parsi		yes, Blue1
2011-11-02T10:21:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	CV: computer vision
2011-11-02T10:21:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	if you do a dpkg -l  | grep <packagename> does it show up>
2011-11-02T10:22:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	let me try
2011-11-02T10:23:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	it shows nothing
2011-11-02T10:23:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	what does  which opencv
2011-11-02T10:23:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	say?
2011-11-02T10:24:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	it jumps to next line
2011-11-02T10:24:00.000Z	Parsi		dpkg -l  | grep opencv
2011-11-02T10:25:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	yeah I didn't think the dpkg would work after you told me it was in a make file.  so where is it installed, in your own directory?
2011-11-02T10:25:00.000Z	Parsi		/home/opencv2.2
2011-11-02T10:26:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	okay so you have a user called opencv2.2 ?
2011-11-02T10:26:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	a user? it's a folder
2011-11-02T10:27:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	beside Music, Downloads and other folders
2011-11-02T10:27:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	okay - well you should be able to just delete the folder then, and start over.
2011-11-02T10:27:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	thank you
2011-11-02T10:28:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	 make sure when you delete it, you are careful.  don't delete all your home directory.
2011-11-02T10:30:00.000Z	Parsi	Blue1	yes, I know :D
2011-11-02T10:30:00.000Z	Blue1	Parsi	i have shot off my foot, more then once.  be careful out there.
