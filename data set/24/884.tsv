2011-06-05T20:13:00.000Z	jon_athon		How do I submit bugs to Ubuntu?
2011-06-05T20:14:00.000Z	jon_athon		if I touch it the pointer jumps all over
2011-06-05T20:15:00.000Z	jon_athon		it clicks just by dragging around
2011-06-05T20:15:00.000Z	jon_athon		double clicks
2011-06-05T20:15:00.000Z	jon_athon		I think it's a speed addict
2011-06-05T20:15:00.000Z	jon_athon		Yea, I dunno what package has the bug though....
2011-06-05T20:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	sounds like the touchpad is set way too sensitive. try adjusting the sensitivity in the Mouse settings.
2011-06-05T20:18:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	tried that
2011-06-05T20:18:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	my sensitivity is the lowest it will go
2011-06-05T20:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	run: apt-cache policy tpconfig
2011-06-05T20:21:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	yea
2011-06-05T20:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	have you tried running tpconfig?
2011-06-05T20:22:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	nope
2011-06-05T20:23:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	what is it?
2011-06-05T20:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	tpconfig - touchpad device configuration utility
2011-06-05T20:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	give it a shot, if that doesn't help I am not sure what else you can do. I don't have a touchpad here to try on.
2011-06-05T20:26:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	well, despite saying it was installed, when I tried to run it it says it's not installed
2011-06-05T20:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	install it :)
2011-06-05T20:33:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	Well, it's installed.. but it won't let me modify any settings
2011-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	it is a GUI tool?
2011-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	no
2011-06-05T20:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	jon_athon	try running with sudo perhaps.
2011-06-05T20:35:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	ye I had a root terminal open
2011-06-05T20:36:00.000Z	jon_athon	IdleOne	no worries
