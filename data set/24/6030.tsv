2006-02-24T14:45:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	just killall synaptic and then killall apt-get and try again
2006-02-24T14:46:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	what were you trying to apt-get?

2006-02-24T14:49:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	are you able to boot computer and login to console?
2006-02-24T14:49:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	password will be your user pass
2006-02-24T14:49:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	you might get an error
2006-02-24T14:50:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	insert cd or something

2006-02-24T14:51:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	depends on your connection speed and computer it can take a while

2006-02-24T14:53:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start this prob wont work but try it
2006-02-24T14:54:00.000Z	bdawg	dyrne	failed
2006-02-24T14:55:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	it might be easier to reboot with install cd and at boot> prompt type server and enter then go back through install.  that should install fine and then you could apt-get install ubuntu-desktop again
2006-02-24T14:56:00.000Z	dyrne	bdawg	good luck
