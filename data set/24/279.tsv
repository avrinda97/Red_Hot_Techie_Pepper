2012-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	Bunie		Cmon someone help out a linux nub Q~Q
2012-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	Bunie		Does wine have a 64-bit build?
2012-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	Bunie		and if not, is 4GB of ram fine for a 32-bit build of Ubuntu?
2012-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	Bunie		i had a bad experience with 64-bit ubuntu a long while back, with drivers and such. if i were you, with 4GB of ram, wich would you go with?
2012-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	Bunie		if you were me* lols
2012-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	Bunie		and wich is faster/better, XFCE or LDE? :P
2012-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	Bunie		faster/more ram efficient.. Basically wich one serves its purpose better
2012-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	Bunie		trying to pick out wich ubuntu distro is for me :P are they all well supported? I've also wondered, i know Ubuntu gets system updates, However, when something such as, ubuntu 12 comes out, will i be updated to it, or will i need to reinstall?
2012-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	Bunie		is Lubuntu ran/handled by the same team as Ubuntu? Updates and support and such?
2012-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 i think they have their own dev team...
2012-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	Resistance		but sometimes they show up in here
2012-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	Resistance		!lubuntu | Bunie
2012-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 that should sufficiently answer your question, but feel free to ask away in here.
2012-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	Bunie	Resistance	Thanks :D I joined their a second ago. I'm really interested in switching over to a linux distro, but like any windows user, i need to be weened lols
2012-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 heh, well all the Ubuntu distros are decent, but imo, 11.10 has a mess of problems with it, bugs and what not.
2012-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 and fwiw, i'm a KDE user, and i help GNOME users here :P
2012-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	Resistance		case-in-point for non-GNOME users showing up in the standard ubuntu channel
2012-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	Bunie	Resistance	I think i've chosen lubuntu as my distro, it looks the most windows like and i've been told by a complete stranger that it has the highest performance
2012-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 IMO performance is dependent on hardware and use-case of an OS
2012-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 most techies will agree with that
2012-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Bunie	Resistance	the pc im installing it on has a poor graphics card, i dont think it'd handle all that pretty stuff gnome does too well
2012-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 xfce's relatively low resource, fwiw
2012-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	Bunie	Resistance	Sorry for spamming you guys lol but like, i use Firefox nightly, from here http://nightly.mozilla.org/ will this be a simple install as it is on windows? (is that linux build compatable, i mean)
2012-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	Resistance	Bunie	 standby, got to fix one of my bots in one of my projects' channels
