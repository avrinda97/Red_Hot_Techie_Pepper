2008-05-16T08:47:00.000Z	SeaPhor	blizzardman1219	ok modprobe is at 5, and iwconfig is 9, are you sure everything in between was done correctly, and without any errors?
2008-05-16T08:47:00.000Z	SeaPhor	blizzardman1219	like what happened at 8?
2008-05-16T08:48:00.000Z	blizzardman1219	SeaPhor	i did iwconfig afterward just to see if it recognized the card. it didn't, so i couldn't get to the things afterward.
