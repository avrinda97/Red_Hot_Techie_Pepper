2006-03-26T17:18:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	What type of internet are you talking? Dialup, dsl, cable, wireless router? Info, info!
2006-03-26T17:19:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	 linksys router with cable internet
2006-03-26T17:20:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	Hardwire?
2006-03-26T17:20:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	yes always has been
2006-03-26T17:21:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	i would reinstall but the installer no longer gets internet either
2006-03-26T17:21:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	says DHCP Error
2006-03-26T17:22:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	I am on a text terminal, so I won't be able to check out any pastebin from here.
2006-03-26T17:23:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	ok but what do you think i can do? its really odd
2006-03-26T17:24:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	Well, I would check via ifconfig, if eth0 is reachable. Possibly try configuring it statically to be on the same subnet. Then ifup eth0, to see if it will come up. Sure the router hasn't had any sort of changes applied? I turned on the access list, and forgot it knocked my mythtv box off internet connections.
2006-03-26T17:26:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	about the router the light for the port doesnt even come on and in an effort to fix this i have restored defaults ifconfig shows eth0 but dhclient doesnt let it get an ip if i statically give it one it just doesnt work faster
2006-03-26T17:26:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	You mean you restored the router's default settings?
2006-03-26T17:26:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	yes but it wasnt working before i did that as well
2006-03-26T17:27:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	I can only think to go verify the router is turned on for DHCP services, and that you don't have some access control list turned on, denying anyone access.
2006-03-26T17:27:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	checking
2006-03-26T17:29:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	i checked it all the settings look fine
2006-03-26T17:29:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	Does /etc/resolv.conf point at your router?
2006-03-26T17:30:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	no actually
2006-03-26T17:31:00.000Z	Goldfisch	ChronusDark	My configuration points to the nearest naming service, being the router. The other opportunities are to point /etc/resolv.conf to another DNS service, probably from your ISP out on the Internet.
2006-03-26T17:31:00.000Z	ChronusDark	Goldfisch	gonna point it to my router and try that
