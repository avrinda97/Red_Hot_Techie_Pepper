2009-04-22T08:26:00.000Z	jcapinc		hey has anyone else noticed openoffice word processor interfering with compiz fusion?
2009-04-22T08:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	nope
2009-04-22T08:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	are you using the gnome-do doc? like Awn?
2009-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	yes, that is what is freaking out the most, but both the OO.o window and other window borders freak out a little too
2009-04-22T08:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	have you tried gnome-do without the doc to see if it's something the doc is doing?
2009-04-22T08:30:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	no I just noticed it, let me try that
2009-04-22T08:32:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	alright I have tried what you suggest it, I can narrow it down to  OO.o because when I close docky, windows still behave improperly, as in when I hover over the minimize, max and close buttons it causes the window border on any window to phase in and out of visibility
2009-04-22T08:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	perhaps you'll also need to restart OO
2009-04-22T08:34:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	yea,  tried that same issue, I actually closed all my programs and restarted everything, in fact thats how I found the problem
2009-04-22T08:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	do you have java turned on in the OO setup?
2009-04-22T08:36:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	uh no, I actually dont know anything about that, OO is written in java?
2009-04-22T08:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	nevermind.. you have to turn it on, on purpose.. not really needed.. still.. it might be that 177 driver you're using.  I really didn't like that one.. have you tried the 173 or the 180.11?
2009-04-22T08:38:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	huh, funny update, it only seems to cause problems when openoffice has focus, and I really dont want to mess with my video drivers, I did before and it was a nightmare to get my settings back, so if thats really all we can come to as the problem I will just deal with it, its nvidia's proprietary crap and not ubuntus
2009-04-22T08:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	k.. you might ask in OO's channel as well.. they might know something that we don't here.
2009-04-22T08:40:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	I will try but I suspect there will be few linux users there, thank you for all your help and thought
2009-04-22T08:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	np.. you'd be supprised.. I've had good exprience there.
2009-04-22T08:40:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	thanks, which channel is that exactly?
2009-04-22T08:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	I believe it's #openoffice.org but I'm not sure what server.. you'll have to check their site
2009-04-22T08:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	didn't ask.. do you have compiz turned on?
2009-04-22T08:43:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	ah, its not on freenode, lol this server is all I ever IRC on, I forgot there were others! LOL yes I have compiz turned on, I actually used the compiz-icon to reload compiz and switch between metacity and compiz, so I know for darn sure its on
2009-04-22T08:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	does the issue persist after turning compiz off?
2009-04-22T08:44:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	no, it does not, but the gnome-do bar does not like the lack of compiz
2009-04-22T08:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	jcapinc	catch 22 if you know what that is.
2009-04-22T08:45:00.000Z	jcapinc	Scunizi	indeed, and I do know
