2008-11-26T14:56:00.000Z	Juanolo		Hi ALl
2008-11-26T14:56:00.000Z	Juanolo		I am trying to start a service, /etc/init.d/pbxnsip restart, everyhitng goes ok, no error messages on screen, hoewver no process is loaded, ...I wonder wich file can I take a look to to se service startup errors on Ubuntu server, thanks
2008-11-26T14:57:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	is it a network service?
2008-11-26T14:58:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	yes, it is a PBX server
2008-11-26T15:01:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	i would try running to command manually and see what it says, instead of from init.d
2008-11-26T15:02:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	well runing the command manualy doesn't say anyhthing, it just executes and that's all
2008-11-26T15:02:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	it is supossed to be a process that has to stick to the service list, however even i execute it it doesn't appear on ps -A
2008-11-26T15:02:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	so the command completes and returns you to the terminal?
2008-11-26T15:03:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	yes, it completes and returns me to the terminal without any error message
2008-11-26T15:04:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	strace?
2008-11-26T15:05:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	strace will watch all the system cals made by the binary command.  it will tell you what the binary tries to open/etc.  there is another debugging tool that starts with a g but i cant think of it right now
2008-11-26T15:05:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	I don't have "strace"
2008-11-26T15:06:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	is the app a binary or a script
2008-11-26T15:06:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	the app is a binary
2008-11-26T15:07:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	I have done strace and this is the result: http://pastebin.com/m3afea990
2008-11-26T15:09:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	so I don't understand anything about the information generated by strace
2008-11-26T15:09:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	i see alot of No such file or directory, seems like you have missing libraries
2008-11-26T15:10:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) , which library ?
2008-11-26T15:10:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	it is always asking for : ld.so.nohwcap
2008-11-26T15:10:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	what's that?
2008-11-26T15:11:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	i admit im not that savvy with the debug tools or their output
2008-11-26T15:12:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	strace/gdb are usually last resorts after sifting through documentation on the program and forums/web resources.  i would think the program would have some sort of logging functionality
2008-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	Juanolo	canthony	nothing, the information and documentations is very simple, and it si supossed to be as simple as start the process: http://wiki.pbxnsip.com/index.php/Installing_in_Linux
2008-11-26T15:17:00.000Z	canthony	Juanolo	is there a specific reason you need to move to 8.10?
