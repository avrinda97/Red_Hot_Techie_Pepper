2010-09-22T23:09:00.000Z	emiam		Hello all! I guess this question wont be appreciated. I am having a problem with the removal of ubuntu: cant figure out at what partition ubuntu is at. I would like to format the partition where ubuntu is located. I am using windows 7. Any tips?
2010-09-22T23:10:00.000Z	emiam		<datacrusher> just google grub ubuntu windows
2010-09-22T23:12:00.000Z	emiam		Anyone know how I can find out at what partition ubuntu is at? I am using windows 7.
2010-09-22T23:13:00.000Z	emiam		Anyone named Anders Jackson in here?
2010-09-22T23:14:00.000Z	talas	emiam	that is something you should do from inside windows.. is the partition not showing up in explorer?
2010-09-22T23:16:00.000Z	emiam	talas	I can see all the partition on my computer, but I cant figure out which one is used by ubuntu.
2010-09-22T23:17:00.000Z	talas	emiam	try entering each on with explorer, you probably cant enter the ones used by ubuntu
2010-09-22T23:19:00.000Z	emiam	talas	I have a total of 5 partitions. One is "OS (C:)", one is "Data (D:)". The remaining three i cant open or do anything except remove.
2010-09-22T23:20:00.000Z	talas	emiam	in that case those 3 ones are probably used by ubuntu
2010-09-22T23:20:00.000Z	talas	emiam	just make suer they're not named recovery or something like that
2010-09-22T23:21:00.000Z	emiam	talas	probably as in go ahead and try or 50-50% they are used by ubuntu?
2010-09-22T23:21:00.000Z	talas	emiam	id 'go ahead and try'...
2010-09-22T23:22:00.000Z	emiam	talas	ah ok. So if I remove these I will remove ubuntu from my computeR?
2010-09-22T23:24:00.000Z	talas	emiam	have you tried wubi? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
2010-09-22T23:26:00.000Z	emiam	talas	nope I have not. Is it neccessary for the removal of Ubuntu?
2010-09-22T23:26:00.000Z	talas	emiam	it should be the easieast way..
2010-09-22T23:26:00.000Z	emiam		So what happens if I remove the partitions?
2010-09-22T23:27:00.000Z	emiam		Sry lot of questions =)
2010-09-22T23:27:00.000Z	talas	emiam	the bootloader will reside i guess
2010-09-22T23:28:00.000Z	emiam	talas	I do not understand that. "reside"?
2010-09-22T23:29:00.000Z	talas	emiam	it means it wont be removed
2010-09-22T23:29:00.000Z	emiam	talas	OK. Thank you for anwsering all my question.
2010-09-22T23:30:00.000Z	talas	emiam	np and hope you come back to us someday :p
2010-09-22T23:30:00.000Z	emiam	talas	I probably will =)
