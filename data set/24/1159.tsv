2010-06-10T00:56:00.000Z	siddhion		how do i make port 80 unblocked so my browsers have access to a healthy connection?
2010-06-10T00:57:00.000Z	siddhion		currently in Xubuntu 10.04 all my browsers are running extremely slow. all browsers, not jsut Firefox.
2010-06-10T00:58:00.000Z	siddhion		i heard that port 80 is where all the browsers go through, so I figure I should focus on that issue.
2010-06-10T00:58:00.000Z	siddhion		i am wondering if it is just a bug i might have in Xubuntu 10.04
2010-06-10T00:59:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	I think you need to reset network settings. In Windows I use a bat file that does it for me. Someone here should know how to do it.
2010-06-10T01:00:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	so are you saying my Network Settings were screwed up to begin with? because I just installed Xubuntu 10.04 2 days ago.
2010-06-10T01:01:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	I have dealt with this issue since the beginning
2010-06-10T01:03:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	have you unplugged router and other stuff for 30 seconds and restarted Ubuntu while unplugged?
2010-06-10T01:05:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	well I restarted Xubuntu today a few times. what difference does it make if i unplug the Ethernet cable and turn off the router?
2010-06-10T01:05:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	are you kidding?
2010-06-10T01:05:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	have you heard of night?
2010-06-10T01:05:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	 have you heard of day?
2010-06-10T01:06:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	seriously do that and you will be fine
2010-06-10T01:08:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	but listen, all my other Internet connection dependent apps like Xchat, Transmission and Update Manager run at a healthy connection speed. It is just my browsers that are slow as sin.  Does this fact change my problem in your  eyes? Do you still think unplugging and shutting router down for 30 s is gonna help?
2010-06-10T01:10:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	when I want to check if any internet exists I run Pidgin or the like. It's so small a load that it will run when nothign else will. So you would have to type faster then a Ninja on crack to load Xchat.
2010-06-10T01:11:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	I believe the fix is a forced reset
2010-06-10T01:12:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	should I download Pidgin? and test that out?
2010-06-10T01:13:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	No I was just saying that chat programs have no load on network compared to web browsers. Pictures and videos versus text.
2010-06-10T01:14:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	good point. I should also mention that Google and Gmail load fine in Firefox and Chrome. But other sites like blogs and Twitter will not load at all
2010-06-10T01:15:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	do you ave Java installed? Are you loaded down with plugins? I have about 12!
2010-06-10T01:15:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	I just do not know why Google, Gmail and other basic text sites will load, but high traffic blogs and other web apps will not load.
2010-06-10T01:16:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	Twitter does not depend on Java so that is probably a non issue, wouldnt you agree?
2010-06-10T01:16:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	siddhion	I was just asking because java problems seem to hanf FF
2010-06-10T01:17:00.000Z	siddhion	Sam_Fisher	just to be safe, how would I check to see if I have Java installed?
