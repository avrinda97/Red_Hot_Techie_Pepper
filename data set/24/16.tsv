2004-09-29T07:33:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	and an iron will. ;)
2004-09-29T07:34:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	heh.
2004-09-29T07:34:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	i'm very interested what ubuntu is doing.
2004-10-04T11:07:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	would loading the acpi/apm moduels help by any chance?
2004-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	what kind of machine?
2004-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	pipka had the same problem
2004-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	toshiba tecra 8100, p3-750, 128M
2004-10-04T11:05:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	oh?  what's pipka using?
2004-10-04T11:08:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	i think i may have to do FC2 for a few days.
2004-10-04T11:08:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	but on sunday/monday, i can do a few more tests.
2004-10-04T11:08:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	cool, thanks
2004-10-04T11:08:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	i have to steal pipka's machine some time and have a poke, too
2004-10-04T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	modprobe toshiba :)
2004-10-04T11:09:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	did pipka try that?
2004-10-04T11:09:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	it was already loaded, from what i remember
2004-10-04T11:11:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	installation was a breeze, tho.  excellent work.  installed over wifi, too
2004-10-04T11:14:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	i just checked my ubuntu install.  toshiba module was nowhere to be found (i did find . |grep -i tosh), and the same in dmesg returned nothing
2004-10-04T11:15:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	too late :(
2004-10-04T11:15:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	i have to get this running emacs in time for school in two hours.  it's got a clean harddrive :P
2004-10-04T11:16:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	are you using emacs for gnome development?
2004-10-04T11:16:00.000Z	jdub	srbaker	no need, i don't embarrass anyone with my code. i just help the real coders. :-)
2004-10-04T12:05:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	so i decided to just wait out the ubuntu installation
2004-10-04T12:06:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	it's just completing now.  about an hour later.
2004-10-04T12:31:00.000Z	srbaker	jdub	so i reboot and modprobe toshiba, and it doesn't seem to get much quicker
