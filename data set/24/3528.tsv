2008-01-18T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	I added thunar to ubuntu, but was not able to figure out how to make it the default
2008-03-03T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	MAy I suggest a backup before you tweek it too much.
2008-03-03T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	I use tar command from cli to do mine.
2008-03-03T20:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	tar cvpzf backupdell.tgz --exclude=/backupdell.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found  --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media --exclude=/root/.Trash -- /    as one example
2008-03-12T19:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	You will need the alternate cd for that
2008-03-12T19:38:00.000Z	Lartza_	Jack_Sparrow	It's not your fault. Is alternate cd bigger than the live.
2008-03-12T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	get the minimal and add as needed.
2008-12-04T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	why would you want to do that? ugh
2008-12-04T19:40:00.000Z	Lartza_	Jack_Sparrow	i sometimes need ubunt for some quick and fast so dont wanna reboot...
2008-12-04T19:45:00.000Z	Lartza_	Jack_Sparrow	but from partition?
2008-12-04T19:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	no, it is not for running your other hd installed windows os.. it installs into ubuntu (sorta)
2008-12-12T11:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	Windows says the ubuntu printer is not connected?
2008-12-12T11:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	You can see why this might be confusing to people
2008-12-12T11:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lartza_	what about booting a livecd and using that to print
