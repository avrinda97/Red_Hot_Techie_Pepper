2008-01-19T20:54:00.000Z	ada1		mrbostigon i don't have access to transfer that file into etc network
2008-01-19T20:56:00.000Z	ada1		mrbostigon what i'm saying is you can copy the file into the hd folder.  it doesn't let you
2008-01-19T20:56:00.000Z	ada1		mrbostigon besides it's the same exact file
2008-01-19T20:58:00.000Z	ada1		it's the same file bro.   same exactly nothing differen.t  so it does not make sense to replace it
2008-01-19T20:58:00.000Z	ada1		it's the same contents
2008-01-19T20:59:00.000Z	ada1		mrbostigon the problem is that my wireless is detected just fine from live cd, but after install it's not.  and i only have one interenet connecttion.  the router is not available to me.
2008-01-19T21:00:00.000Z	ada1		mrbostigon so i can't plug in

2008-01-19T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	ada1	have you looked on the internet and ubuntuforums or is this your first stop?
2008-01-19T21:09:00.000Z	ada1	bazhang	 but the problem is that this is such a popular adapter, and my computer is in good shape...so i don't understand what is going on here.  this should be relatively simple to fix.
2008-01-19T21:14:00.000Z	ada1	bazhang	i've been everywhere man.  i just want to know if it's posible to fix my problem while i'm still on the livecd
2008-01-19T21:16:00.000Z	ada1	bazhang	 i'm desperate man.....dyin'  ready to shoot myself
2008-01-19T21:16:00.000Z	ada1	bazhang	not really...
