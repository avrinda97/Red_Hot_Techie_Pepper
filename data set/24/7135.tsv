2005-04-18T08:37:00.000Z	xiaogil		how to run the command : cat myfile | grep AA'any char'BB ?
2005-04-18T08:38:00.000Z	xiaogil		How to look for ABC+"any character"+DEF in gedit ?
2005-04-18T08:38:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	does it have regexp search?
2005-04-18T08:38:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	regexp: /^ABC.*DEF$/
2005-04-18T08:39:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	should be because it works for \t
2005-04-18T08:39:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	it'll match 'blabla ABCsadsadDEF asdsadsad'
2005-04-18T08:40:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	thanks a lot
2005-04-18T08:43:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	it doesn't work... what can i write to look for : 1.'any_char'.2 ? Or 1.*.2 ?
2005-04-18T08:43:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	try without ^ and $
2005-04-18T08:44:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	shufla@atari:~$ echo "ABCasdsadDEF" | egrep ^ABC.\*DEF\$
2005-04-18T08:46:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	ok, then i don't know how to make it work in gedit (only \t works in it)
2005-04-18T08:46:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	i'm in X back, i'll check it right now
2005-04-18T08:48:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	well. gedit do not support regexps, sorry.
2005-04-18T08:49:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	ok, thanks for your help!
2005-04-18T08:49:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	try more advanced editor.
2005-04-18T08:49:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	like which one ?
2005-04-18T08:51:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	use synaptic and search "Name and desc" with string "text editor"
2005-04-18T08:52:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	have you ever tried `vim'? :D
2005-04-18T08:52:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	if you're looking for something better with gui activate `universe' repository and then do searches for text editor
2005-04-18T08:53:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	or even multiverse
2005-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	aahhh! there's section editors in synaptic.
2005-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	i'll relog and try my newly installed vim for gnome...
2005-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	Shufla	xiaogil	poor you :D newvimcomer :D
2005-04-18T08:59:00.000Z	xiaogil	Shufla	i used vim quite a lot before, but i just want something gaphical that use regexp
