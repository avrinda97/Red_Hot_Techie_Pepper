2009-02-11T05:25:00.000Z	bernz		hah, ubottu supports piping -- how cute!  :-D
2009-02-11T05:25:00.000Z	unop	bernz	and redirection too :)
2009-02-11T05:25:00.000Z	bernz	unop	wow, he's smarter than i am ... ROFL
2009-02-26T20:35:00.000Z	unop	bernz	he's got the word 'wget' in that file -- and APT doesn't understand the meaning of the word
2009-02-26T20:36:00.000Z	bernz	unop	ahh... hmm... that's tough to fix (particularly if the file has been edited)
2009-02-26T20:36:00.000Z	unop	bernz	errm, no, just edit the file and take the odd bits out
2009-02-26T20:38:00.000Z	bernz	unop	yeah, but one has to identify the "odd bits" (to avoid further damage); that's the tricky part (unless one is already "good" at doing so)
2009-02-26T21:09:00.000Z	unop	bernz	sure there is .. see my response
2009-02-26T21:20:00.000Z	bernz	unop	on that subject, what if there's more than one same-named process running -- how does the shell evaluate $(pidof x) then?
2009-02-26T21:21:00.000Z	unop	bernz	it'd fail .. the extra PIDs would become arguments to kill (which it wouldn't understand)
2009-02-26T21:27:00.000Z	bernz	unop	i dropped there for a second and maybe missed your response: how does $(pidof x) evaluate when there's more than one x process running?
2009-02-26T21:28:00.000Z	unop	bernz	with regards to kill .. it would send the signal to each one of them
2009-02-26T21:28:00.000Z	bernz	unop	oh i see, it's 'kill' who understands '$(pidof )'... :-) cheers
2009-02-26T21:29:00.000Z	unop	bernz	so i'd say it depends on what the entire command was and whether or not multiple PIDs pose a problem
2009-02-26T21:29:00.000Z	unop	bernz	no, bash does the expansion and passes it on to kill
2009-02-26T21:29:00.000Z	bernz	unop	oh, okay, got it
2009-02-26T22:00:00.000Z	bernz	unop	could Menothusis put a "watch" of file-touches, and then run FF, and check what files it grabbed at to see what needs deleting? (i don't know if such a "watch for handle attempts on a file" util exists, but...)
2009-02-26T22:00:00.000Z	unop	bernz	strace firefox
2009-03-19T07:51:00.000Z	bernz	unop	note, frank_austin has used a "one" character, not a lower-case "ell" character, as the 2nd-last in the name, and i'm used to seeing "ell dee", not "one dee" after "*.so." -- could this be a factor?
2009-03-19T07:52:00.000Z	unop	bernz	it's a "1d" alright ..
2009-03-19T07:52:00.000Z	bernz	unop	okay
2009-03-19T09:18:00.000Z	bernz	unop	well, if he's able to IRC, he's not totally dead in the water :-)
2009-03-19T09:19:00.000Z	unop	bernz	he's SSHed into another host that's having the problem.
2009-03-19T09:19:00.000Z	bernz	unop	oooh
