2011-05-11T05:42:00.000Z	plustax		Im running 11.04 how do I hook up my laptop to my TV via hdmi? Cable is already hooked up, I just can't get my screen to pop up on my TV
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	plustax		okay lemme look into it.
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	escott	plustax	its true name is gnome-display-properties
2011-05-11T05:44:00.000Z	escott	plustax	there is a monitors application which is a gui to xrandr
2011-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	escott	plustax	have you tried hitting the function button to enable the output display, maybe the hardware requires that you do that
2011-05-11T05:52:00.000Z	plustax	escott	function button?
2011-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	escott	plustax	and gnome-display-properties/xrandr isn't showing the other screen
2011-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	plustax	escott	nope
2011-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	escott	plustax	what kind of graphics card is this
2011-05-11T05:55:00.000Z	escott	plustax	i understand that nvidia doesn't use xrandr... we've been going at this all wrong
2011-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	escott	plustax	i think you need to use whatever the nvidia screen resolution control application is
2011-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	plustax	escott	okay
2011-05-11T06:07:00.000Z	escott	plustax	i'm not sure we can help much there. it is an nvidia driver
2011-05-11T06:07:00.000Z	plustax	escott	how can I tell if I have the correct nvidia driver?
2011-05-11T06:08:00.000Z	escott	plustax	its not that you don't have the right driver, its that we can't really support that because nobody knows what that driver does
2011-05-11T06:11:00.000Z	escott	plustax	if you have nvidia-current then you have the nvidia driver. there are a couple alternatives including a plain 2d driver, and a very new reverse-engineered driver called nouveau. i've avoided nvidia for years now so I don't know what works and what doesnt
2012-04-12T07:18:00.000Z	escott	plustax	netbook remix got folded into the main os
2012-06-02T03:41:00.000Z	escott	plustax	sudo -i is prefered over sudo su
2012-06-02T03:44:00.000Z	escott	plustax	it would be /home/username/Desktop/whatever
2012-10-21T23:59:00.000Z	escott	plustax	if they specify a directory in $HOME that doesn't exist then just create it
2012-10-22T00:00:00.000Z	escott	plustax	there are multiple ways you could do this. if you put it in /usr/share/themes then the files need to be owned by root:root and you do everything with sudo/gksudo. then anyone can use that theme. or if its just for yourself then $HOME/.themes or $HOME/.icons (whatever it is) would be more appropriate
2012-10-22T00:01:00.000Z	plustax	escott	I guess I dont understand what you mean. Just tell me how to extract this 7z file into the themes folder
2012-10-22T00:01:00.000Z	escott	plustax	to copy a file as root "sudo cp sourcefile destinationfile"
2012-10-22T00:09:00.000Z	escott	plustax	i would discourage doing that but the gui filemanager is called "nautilus"
