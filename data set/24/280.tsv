2012-01-03T01:32:00.000Z	Bunie	bs	When you click Windows 7, try pressing "f8" rapidly Lols. Sounds dumb but, it might give you an XP option
2012-01-03T01:32:00.000Z	Bunie	bs	or when your Pc comes on, you may have an F11 or F12 option to select to boot from your 2nd hdd.
2012-01-03T01:33:00.000Z	bs	Bunie	when i click windows 7 it give me option for windows xp although when i click it dont start it's like if grup change the boot for windows xp only windows 7 work
2012-01-03T01:34:00.000Z	Bunie	bs	so you have a Windows XP option after you click Windows 7 in grub?
2012-01-03T01:34:00.000Z	Bunie	bs	Sounds like you killed your XP Partition.
2012-01-03T01:35:00.000Z	bs	Bunie	no i didnt kill my windows xp it's just a matter of grup booting
2012-01-03T01:36:00.000Z	Bunie	bs	once you select XP, you get two options on screen "Windows 7" and "windows XP Home Edition"?
