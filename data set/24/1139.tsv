2011-06-10T11:39:00.000Z	Ileden		Help! My move operation, done using Nautilus, of over 80GB data from one computer to another (via network) seems to have gotten stuck. Any idea how to troubleshoot?
2011-06-10T11:40:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	network connectivity (i.e., ping) still work?
2011-06-10T11:41:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	yes
2011-06-10T11:41:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	i always find it safer to use rsync to transfer files over the network
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	yea, should've used that, retrospectively thinking. just aren't familiar with it.
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	it's fairly easy once you get your head around it :)
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	Can rsync be used to move also, not just copy?
2011-06-10T11:42:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	yes, i believe so
2011-06-10T11:43:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	also, it is simple enough to resume the broken transfer with rsync? In that case I could just cancel the current, stuck, one and pick it up with rsync
2011-06-10T11:43:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	i think the --remove-source-files will do it
2011-06-10T11:43:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	rsync can pick up broken rsync transfers easily
2011-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	worse comes to worse, if it can't move it, you can always sync it, then rm -rf the source :P
2011-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	yes. Well, let's see i guess.
2011-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	true
2011-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	So what would be the command to try and resume a transfer? Does this seem ok: rsync -rvh --remove-source-files me@host:sourcepath destinationpath
2011-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	Hm, I mean: rsync -arvh --remove-source-files me@host:sourcepath destinationpath
2011-06-10T11:53:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	i'd put a -P in there as well
2011-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	puts partially transferred files - better for resuming later
2011-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	and a -v
2011-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	is there an option for removing source directories as well? I couldn't find.
2011-06-10T11:54:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	directories wise, i couldn't see it either :(
2011-06-10T11:56:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	yup, not a problem.
2011-06-10T12:02:00.000Z	Ileden	MrPPS	Is there a way to get rsync to first go through all the files, and then give me an estimate of transfer time?
2011-06-10T12:04:00.000Z	MrPPS	Ileden	none that I know of, no
