2011-11-26T13:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	what do you mean by a "shutdown box"?
2011-11-26T13:44:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: something like this http://imgur.com/OmjUt
2011-11-26T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	Are you asking how to access the shutdown option?
2011-11-26T13:44:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: yes
2011-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	What version of Ubuntu?
2011-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	but using cli
2011-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: 11.10 but without the unity plugin. i disabled them
2011-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	wait, what?  You showed a GUI, and now you're asking for a command?
2011-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: i want a command to run that gui box
2011-11-26T13:47:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: [note] i dont have unity plugin. so i need to make a button inside the menu. and how to access log out and lock screen. as you may see, that option is not in that box
2011-11-26T13:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	what are you running for a GUI?
2011-11-26T13:48:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: that gui? there is an add-on in cairo-dock. but i don't like it like that. i want to add the shutdown option inside the menu itself, using alacarte. so i need to know its command
2011-11-26T13:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	No, back up.  You said you're not using Unity.  So, what are you using?  Gnome-shell?
2011-11-26T13:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	You should already have a button for shutdown, so I'm not sure what you're attempting to accomplish, or more importantly why.
2011-11-26T13:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	What do you mean by "unity plugin"?  Unity's not a "plugin" to anything - it's an entire interface.
2011-11-26T13:52:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: imagine running unity interface, then you go to ccsm, then you untick on unity plugin. that is what basically my system is. or if you dont mind could you open your alacarte and see if the shutdown menu command is there
2011-11-26T13:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	Anyway, it looks like it's gnome-session-quit
2011-11-26T13:53:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	thanks, but that only gimme the log out. how bout shutdown, restart,lock-screen,etc?and i was thinking of an all-in-one box
2011-11-26T13:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	Check the man page.
2011-11-26T13:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	lock screen is done by gnome-screensaver-command
2011-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: just added q. shutdown or reboot require root. how can i do them without root?
2011-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	inashdeen	sudo / gksu?
2011-11-26T14:10:00.000Z	inashdeen	tonyyarusso	: i want to reboot/shutdown without it prompting me for password
