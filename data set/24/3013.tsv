2008-05-26T17:59:00.000Z	GarethSimpsonUK		the owner of directory where the drive is mounted is root
2008-05-26T18:00:00.000Z	GarethSimpsonUK		but no-one can lol
2008-05-26T18:00:00.000Z	GarethSimpsonUK		i can read from windoes but no write
2008-05-26T18:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	you need write permissions on the folder
2008-05-26T18:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	have you tried from the terminal
2008-05-26T18:03:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	 sudo chmod 777 *
2008-05-26T18:03:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	after cd'ing to to right folder
2008-05-26T18:04:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	it will let anyone write to it...that is what 777 means
2008-05-26T18:04:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	7=111 in binary
2008-05-26T18:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	therefore <user><group><other> can all right to a file if its mode is changed to 111(7 in decimal)
2008-05-26T18:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	you would need to do that ordinarily ...since the folder is owned by the "samba" group
2008-05-26T18:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	so you'd need to add "gareth" to "samba"
2008-05-26T18:09:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	also do a sudo chmod 777 ./
2008-05-26T18:09:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	in the right dir of course
2008-05-26T18:17:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	i've faced this problem lots of times...never found a solution
2008-05-26T18:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	does empty password work?
2008-05-26T18:23:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	kde(kubuntu-desktop)+gnome(ubuntu-desktop) takes about 3.7 igs
2008-05-26T18:32:00.000Z	GarethSimpsonUK	anirudh0	i tried to install ubuntu server + ubuntu-desktop on a 4 gb and it worked but when upgrading to hardy it ran out of space, so how could kde & gnome fit on 3.7? am i misunderstanding you? i would like only kde (+ hardy) will this fit comfortably on a 4 gb? i don't want any data on there, just os / apps / kde / swap. all data will be on another 3 ide drives
2008-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	when upgrading files are downloaded first
2008-05-26T18:33:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	the download is itself more than a gb
2008-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	so if you are so tight on space...you might face problems..i meant 3.7 gig for a fresh install
2008-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	no
2008-05-26T18:34:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	no to both questions
2008-05-26T18:35:00.000Z	anirudh0	GarethSimpsonUK	use a 8 gb partition..thats more than enough
