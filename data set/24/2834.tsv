2009-04-04T07:10:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	explain your situation.
2009-04-04T07:12:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	i ran into a HDD problem due to loose connections in the power cord, some data corrupted
2009-04-04T07:12:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	once i fixed it, its been working fine but i ran fsck on a mounted partition once [might be a problem?]
2009-04-04T07:13:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	are you still seeing issues?  Or is the issue that you can't load Gnome?
2009-04-04T07:13:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	no issues now
2009-04-04T07:13:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	it was just a loose power cord, i stuck it to place now, i dont get HDD errors anymore
2009-04-04T07:13:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	so I guess my question is, what problem(s) are you having right now?  Or questions?
2009-04-04T07:14:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	gnome doesn't start!
2009-04-04T07:14:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	any error messages?
2009-04-04T07:14:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	i tried KDE too, that doesn't either, but e16 and fluxbox work
2009-04-04T07:15:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	Try booting into recovery mode in grub and try to repair packages.
2009-04-04T07:15:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	 An error occurred while loading or saving configuration information for firefox. Some of your configuration settings may not work properly. <-- replace firefox with most gnome app names
2009-04-04T07:16:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	i tried that, dint work!
2009-04-04T07:16:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	I'm not an expert, but it still sounds like you have some filesystem issues.  And like psywiped said, his command won't hurt anything.  You can try:  sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop
2009-04-04T07:17:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	did that already, no effect!
2009-04-04T07:17:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	you did:  sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop ??
2009-04-04T07:17:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	as psywiped said, try:  sudo apt-get install ubuntu
2009-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop. . . E: Couldn't find package ubuntu
2009-04-04T07:22:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	if the problem was on another PC.  We're only trying to help you.
2009-04-04T07:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	reinstall Ubuntu over your current installation.
2009-04-04T07:23:00.000Z	Huufarted	jeeez	with data corruption like you've got, I think your only safe alternative is to get an Ubuntu live CD and reinstall over top of the currently existing one.
2009-04-04T07:27:00.000Z	jeeez	Huufarted	psywiped: thanks for the help guys, need to leave! adios
