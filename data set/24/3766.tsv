2008-01-13T13:48:00.000Z	debaser		 m new with this, i m running 7.10  live cd and i m trying to format my previously ntfs file system to something that gets along with  linux, i tried to format it to ext2 but that didnt work and gparted crashed....now the file system for that partition is shown as unknown
2008-01-13T13:49:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	I used ntfs for a good 6 months without problems when I dual booted. ntfs-3g is really quite good, and installed by default in gutsy.
2008-01-13T13:50:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	i dont want to use dual boot now...just ubuntu
2008-01-13T13:51:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Ok. Are you using the partition manager that comes with the live cd? If so, have you tried deleting the partition in question and reformatting again as ext3?
2008-01-13T13:52:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	, i just tried to delete the partition and gparted has crashed again
2008-01-13T13:52:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Are you still on the livecd, or are you running from the hard-disk right now?
2008-01-13T13:53:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	And are you using the gparted tool from within the livecd, or is it crashing during the install process?
2008-01-13T13:55:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Ok, that probably won't work, since the livecd mounts your disks in such a way that you can't accidentally damage them while using the livecd. If you click the install to hard-disk option after a few screens gparted will be shown again and you can reformat your disks as you please during the install process.
2008-01-13T13:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Dont' sign off. You'll be able to stay online and chat while the install happens.
2008-01-13T13:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Isn't that cool? :)
2008-01-13T13:57:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	, um where is the install to hard disk option :S
2008-01-13T13:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Should be on your desktop. An icon.
2008-01-13T13:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	What icons do you see on your desktop?
2008-01-13T14:00:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	, can i pvt u ...so u can guide me through the process
2008-01-13T14:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Normally I'd say yes, but since I'm involved in more than one conversation we should keep it in here.
2008-01-13T14:01:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	It's quiet though. So we shouldn't have any problems.
2008-01-13T14:03:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	there is an error saying ext3 file system cannot be created in partition 1 :S
2008-01-13T14:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Is there anything on this disk that you're afraid of losing?
2008-01-13T14:04:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Describe the disk to me. Just one disk? How many partitions, of what type, and what's on them?
2008-01-13T14:05:00.000Z	debaser	ArthurArchnix	its a 20gb...
2008-01-13T14:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	But the 20gb.. this is just for ubuntu and then the 200gb this is important for data and such... right so far?
2008-01-13T14:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Sata, or pata disks?
2008-01-13T14:09:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Well.. not the 20 anyway. :) ok.. here's what I think you should do. Turn off the computer and unplug the 200GB disk. Reboot with the live cd and when it comes up tell it that you want to check the disc for errors. This will check the installation disk to make sure it's good. Then, when it comes to install time, just tell it to use the whole disk. It will use your entire 20GB disk for ubuntu. Assuming all goes well, you tu
2008-01-13T14:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	debaser	Unplugging is not strictly necessary, but since it's important to you we should do that to be safe, so that we don't accidentally install stuff to that disk.
