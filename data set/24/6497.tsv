2007-04-28T11:57:00.000Z	bryan		i need help installing a program i just downloaded
2007-04-28T11:57:00.000Z	bryan		i dont remember the terminal commands
2007-04-28T11:58:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	what program is that?
2007-04-28T11:59:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	it told me to use the ./install command in the readme file bu tthat doesnt work
2007-04-28T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	it's always better to install packaged software on ubuntu, rather than bypassing the packaging system.
2007-04-28T12:00:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	i dont know how to do that other than the add/remove or the synaptic
2007-04-28T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	this page has instructions on how to convert video for PSP with ffmpeg, which is packaged
2007-04-28T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_PSP
2007-04-28T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	synaptic will be good for installing ffmpeg
2007-04-28T12:01:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	ignore the "emerge" stuff, which is Gentoo-specific
2007-04-28T12:01:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	it is telling me tyo download it form the gentoo place but it is opening it with the archive managetr, which is the same way i opened my other program
2007-04-28T12:02:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	it seems that the program i downloaded earlier is the most supported
2007-04-28T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	what's the name?
2007-04-28T12:04:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	thats what the folder is named in my home folder
2007-04-28T12:04:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	okay. Did you cd to that directory before you tried ./install ?
2007-04-28T12:05:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	after i downloaded both programs(the one you said and the psp one) i extracted them to my home folder
2007-04-28T12:05:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	no i did not
2007-04-28T12:06:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	I didn't mean for you to download anything. ffmpeg is installed by running 'sudo apt-get install ffmpeg'
2007-04-28T12:06:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	it's extremely easy, once you understand how. What's more, it doesn't break like Windows does - no DLL hell in Linux
2007-04-28T12:07:00.000Z	bryan	soundray	i did that thankx
2007-04-28T12:07:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	you installed ffmpeg, and it worked?
2007-04-28T12:08:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	then you should be able to use the command from the Gentoo advice page, 'ffmpeg -i Video.avi -f psp -r 29 -b 768 -ar 24000 -ab 64 -s 320x240 M4V00001.MP4'
2007-04-28T12:09:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	be sure to replace the real name of the video file you are converting
2007-04-28T12:11:00.000Z	soundray	bryan	then you should be able to use the command from the Gentoo advice page, 'ffmpeg -i Video.avi -f psp -r 29 -b 768 -ar 24000 -ab 64 -s 320x240 M4V00001.MP4'
