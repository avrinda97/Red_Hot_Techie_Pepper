2005-07-09T11:04:00.000Z	zerboxx		when do do "sudo apt-get upgrade" it says that some mozilla-firefox things have been held back, why? do I want to get it anyways? and how?
2005-07-09T11:05:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	could u paste wht it exactly says to the pastebin
2005-07-09T11:05:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	sorry, pastebin?
2005-07-09T11:06:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	/395
2005-07-09T11:07:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	hmm.....like spanish said, apt-get holds back packages tht cause a conflict, but conflict with wht :S
2005-07-09T11:07:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	maybe ur running firefox and tht could be the reason?
2005-07-09T11:08:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	ah maybe!
2005-07-09T11:08:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	nope
2005-07-09T11:09:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	I was using the synaptic thingy before and it looks like it's the 1.04 version of firefox, which I need/want...
2005-07-09T11:09:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	the firefox installed with ubuntu is alreadt 1.0.4, just tht they forgot to increment the version number
2005-07-09T11:10:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	could the upgrade fix that version number?
2005-07-09T11:10:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	heres wht u do...go to firefox and type about:config in the address bar
2005-07-09T11:10:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	now find the key general.useraget.vendorsub.and edit its value to read 1.0.4
2005-07-09T11:12:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	thanks! any other changes to about:config I should do (other than those listed in the ubuntuguide)?
2005-07-09T11:12:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	nope....tht will get u started with the extentions for firefox, if thts wht u wanted to do
2005-07-09T11:13:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	yup, miss all my extensions since I moved from xp
2005-07-09T11:13:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	right :)

2005-07-09T11:27:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	palm, can't get it to recognize computer, or viceversa
2005-07-09T11:30:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	I may have just figured the palm problem out, but I still have an audio/video sync problem (nothing to do with palm)
2005-07-09T12:00:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	sorry i had phonecall............u solved ur problems with the sound?
2005-07-09T12:06:00.000Z	zerboxx	adwait	no, when watching a video, the sync is off, no idea how to fix it
2005-07-26T08:38:00.000Z	adwait	zerboxx	afaik........nope
