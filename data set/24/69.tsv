2012-09-03T13:05:00.000Z	jake443		what is the extended partition used for ?
2012-09-03T13:06:00.000Z	jake443		i don't understand it
2012-09-03T13:06:00.000Z	jake443		i have 1 partition and i want all spaces in that 1 partition
2012-09-03T13:07:00.000Z	jake443		i have parimary parition then extend then swap parition
2012-09-03T13:07:00.000Z	jake443		so basiclly i used a single parition
2012-09-03T13:07:00.000Z	jake443		what happens if i remove it ?
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	jake443		it's a 500MB extend partition
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	jake443		i don't want it
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	jake443		nothing in it
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	tsimpson	jake443	that likely is where your swap partition is, which would be taking up those 500MB
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	jake443		i never used it once.. ubuntu created extended parition
2012-09-03T13:08:00.000Z	jake443		i have 1 logical parimiary parition for the OS only
2012-09-03T13:09:00.000Z	jake443	tsimpson	yes my man.. i have 500MB extended and 500MB swap
2012-09-03T13:09:00.000Z	jake443		altantic i am a windows user
2012-09-03T13:09:00.000Z	jake443		you either help me or i'm going back
2012-09-03T13:09:00.000Z	tsimpson	jake443	threats like that get you nowhere fast
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	jake443		i DON'T want extended parition because i use only 1 parition on this PC
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	tsimpson		the swap partition is actually in the same disk space as the extended partition, it's just saying that you only have the swap on there
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	jake443		and i will never parition this space because the space is little .. not much
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	jake443		ok i don't want extended.. what happens if i remove it ?
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	tsimpson	jake443	you do have a partition there, the swap partition
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	jake443		i don't want swap too
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	jake443		i have it disable it
2012-09-03T13:11:00.000Z	tsimpson	jake443	why don't you want swap?
