2007-07-01T10:11:00.000Z	foxjazz	Ramzi	it looks like you may have to edit your config
2007-07-01T10:23:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	I have an idea. Do you think I could paste my xorg.conf and you add the resses?
2007-07-01T10:23:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	Your xorg.conf probably won't work since we might not have all the same hardware
2007-07-01T10:27:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	You can make a post on www.everfall.com/paste
2007-07-01T10:27:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	Or you can directly edit mine
2007-07-01T10:30:00.000Z	foxjazz	Ramzi	: http://www.everfall.com/paste/id.php?dg4900om8y85
2007-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	foxjazz	Ramzi	?? hmmm well you get the Jist I hope
2007-07-01T10:40:00.000Z	foxjazz	Ramzi	your gettning NOTHING in the res dialog
2007-07-01T10:40:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	Only 800x600
2007-07-01T10:41:00.000Z	Ramzi	foxjazz	what you pasted on everfall was just a small portion
