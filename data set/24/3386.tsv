2008-02-04T21:23:00.000Z	nakerlund		Anyone got time to help me get my sound working?
2008-02-04T21:25:00.000Z	nakerlund		I got a built in ac97... on a nforce3 motherboard
2008-02-04T21:26:00.000Z	nakerlund		Umm ok... hold on a second :)
2008-02-04T21:28:00.000Z	nakerlund		ousr13, did that and it says it is found and the driver is snd_indel8x0...
2008-02-04T21:29:00.000Z	nakerlund		usr13: Do you want to know what it says word for word?
2008-02-04T21:30:00.000Z	nakerlund		usr13, Yes four lines
2008-02-04T21:31:00.000Z	nakerlund		is there a shortcut for picking up nicknames when you write to someone?
2008-02-04T21:31:00.000Z	nakerlund		I got the volume up as far as I know.. I've tried unmuting everything too
2008-02-04T21:32:00.000Z	nakerlund		Yes, they are connected... I got sound in vista
2008-02-04T21:33:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	sounds issues, im guessing ?
2008-02-04T21:34:00.000Z	nakerlund	neverblue	Yes, sound issues :)
2008-02-04T21:34:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	all the hardware works fine? (sound card, speakers, headphones)
2008-02-04T21:36:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	use 'alsamixer', in a terminal
2008-02-04T21:39:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	try 'alsamixer'
2008-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	nakerlund	neverblue	alsamixer doesn't give anything..
2008-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	sudo aptitude search alsamixer
2008-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	then run it, once installed
2008-02-04T21:41:00.000Z	nakerlund	neverblue	 I get two rows.. alsaixergui and gnome-alsamixer
2008-02-04T21:42:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	install
2008-02-04T21:43:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	i think you might want to check your spelling (or use tab-completion to finish the command)
2008-02-04T21:44:00.000Z	nakerlund	neverblue	What was I supposed to install?
2008-02-04T21:44:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	what was returned from the results....
2008-02-04T21:46:00.000Z	nakerlund	neverblue	The alsamixer list?
2008-02-04T21:46:00.000Z	neverblue	nakerlund	seems your having a problem following instructions, good luck! :)
