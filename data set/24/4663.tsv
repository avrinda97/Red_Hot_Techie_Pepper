2007-03-11T15:29:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		go to that dir
2007-03-11T15:29:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		and type sh linux. run
2007-03-11T15:29:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		Open a terminal window
2007-03-11T15:29:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		!best
2007-03-11T15:30:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		so open terminal
2007-03-11T15:31:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		and do cd ~/Desktop and then do ./sh <filename> run
2007-03-11T15:31:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		er, ./sh < filename > run
2007-03-11T15:32:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		I can't tell if that's coming through or not because gaim is being a jerk and trying to render anything in angle brackets
2007-03-11T15:34:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		is the filename runMoparScape-Linux.sh
2007-03-11T15:34:00.000Z	robbie_cras1		./sh runMoparScape-Linux.sh
2007-03-11T15:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	you don't need the './' with sh. It's just 'sh file.sh' or ./file.sh
2007-03-11T15:35:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	oh, thanks
2007-03-11T15:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	I think he ran './sh file.sh' which won't work because the system can't execute the file called 'sh'
2007-03-11T15:37:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	because it already knows it's looking for a .sh file so if the file were named file.sh.sh it would run but since it's already running an sh file it's just looking for filename not filename.sh?
2007-03-11T15:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	./sh file.sh  won't work because that tells the system to execute a file named 'sh', but there isn't a file named sh there.
2007-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	You can't log in?
2007-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	Can you get to a tty and sudo?
2007-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	when I try it says: unable to create ~/.gnome2 : permission denied
2007-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	Ouch
2007-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	I can get to a terminal and login and run fine from there, but logging in under gdm doesn't work
2007-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	ls -la ~/.*authority   <-- see if either of those files is owned by root
2007-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	no such file or dir
2007-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	robbie_cras1	Not what I suspected, then.
2007-03-11T15:48:00.000Z	robbie_cras1	ardchoille	any idea?
