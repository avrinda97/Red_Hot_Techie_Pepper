2007-01-08T07:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		127.0.0.1 is localhost
2007-01-08T07:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		there's no place like gnome :p
2007-01-08T07:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		Any GRUB maestroes in? I have a tough one to solve with Edgy!
2007-01-08T07:27:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	MAYBE>>> what exactly is happening?
2007-01-08T07:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	enyc	I've documented it in the forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=333708
2007-01-08T07:30:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	apologies, I do not know about fakeaid myself.... and a do not know enough about grub to answer ;-(
2007-01-08T07:30:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	I colud see you might want to persuade grub that (hd0) is actually /dew/dm0 or whatever manually then put grub on (hd0)
2007-01-08T07:31:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	personally I would avaid fakeraid ;-) ... set the bios etc. to single-disks mode and use linux software raid or LVM  if possible
2007-01-08T07:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	enyc	thanks for looking. - yes, I have and it accepts that
2007-01-08T07:34:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	I do know that you can use grub setup() from anocther system... e.g.g try KNOPPIX 5.1.1 ...
2007-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	it might work aroundh your problem
2007-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	but you'd need fakeraid setup there too of course
2007-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	enyc	eeek, one's enough right now. I don't see how a different distro would help me, except to confuse me :)
2007-01-08T07:35:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	you dont understand...
2007-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	you can do the grub 'setup' when booted from KNOPPIX live cd....
2007-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	Ive done it before ;-)
2007-01-08T07:36:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	given that these are both grub 0.9x versions ...
2007-01-08T07:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	enyc	Oh, yes, I understood that, but i'd still be relying on the same packages (dmraid and grub) so I'm not sure I'd be better off, especially as I have still to install the ubuntu-dmraid into the initrd too
2007-01-08T07:38:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	i do understand... I seriously suggest you turn off the software raid in controller BIOS ,blank the dinsk  and use linux software raid  if you can
2007-01-08T07:38:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	as it will make things a lot easier
2007-01-08T07:38:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	it just means you wont be able to directly boot from the second hdd
2007-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	enyc	I can't, because of the existing Windows installation which has to remain
2007-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	well dont expect it to work easily then
2007-01-08T07:39:00.000Z	enyc	IntuitiveNipple	sorry...
