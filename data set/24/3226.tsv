2008-04-11T18:17:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		hello all
2008-04-11T18:17:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		im new to ubuntu...about 3 months old now
2008-04-11T18:18:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		3 days ago i had a power outage that killed my system.  I have another system to replace it
2008-04-11T18:18:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		my question is this, i have on the new system a raid controller for SATA
2008-04-11T18:18:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		does anyone here notice a difference using a RAID SATA for Ubuntu
2008-04-11T18:19:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		im mean, installing the Ubuntu OS onto the RAID
2008-04-11T18:20:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		Conversely, does Ubuntu have something similar to windows page file?  Could that be set for RAID as well?
2008-04-11T18:20:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		And lastly, my original HD is still functional.  Can i simply install it into another system and will Ubuntu recognize the new hardware accordingly or would I have to do a fresh install?
2008-04-11T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 ive had mixed luck with doing that.. depends on the exact hardware changes.
2008-04-11T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 try it and see. :)  whats it going to hurt.
2008-04-11T18:21:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		Dr_willis....how about this then...install Ubuntu on the RAID then install the original drive...can I access it with a fresh version of Ubuntu?
2008-04-11T18:22:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		Im really new at ubuntu and unsure.  With windows i would know how to get the data
2008-04-11T18:23:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		ok sounds good....linux-image-blah would be what then?
2008-04-11T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 with 'raid' i have found that way too many machines have cheap semi-software raid controllers. that are a pain to get going. Ive stopped using raid.
2008-04-11T18:23:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		benpicco...ok...fresh install and then copy home folder onto the fresh install did i get the right?
2008-04-11T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 i would keep linux on the non-raid drive to play with. :)
2008-04-11T18:24:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3	Dr_willis	and all, where can i find information on performance for OS on RAID or just simply the page file on RAID?  Id like to compare if someone has already done it
2008-04-11T18:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 thers a large varity of raid setups, and a larger varity of controllers and thenya got all sorts of other things to look out for. :)
2008-04-11T18:25:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		benpicco...yes all personal data is in home folder
2008-04-11T18:26:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		Dr_willis...im just looking at RAID 0, lets call it striping because as far as I can tell there is no redundancy
2008-04-11T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 ive given up totally on raid. so cant help much. I dident find the gain worth the pain.
2008-04-11T18:27:00.000Z	Belkinhelp3		Dr_willis...software or hardware RAID?
2008-04-11T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 finding a total hardware raid. seems to bea bit hard these days. :) without spending  more $$$ then i want.
2008-04-11T18:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Belkinhelp3	 then theres the total software route - that i hear under linux - works decently.. THEn ya got the cheap raid controllers on most MB;s that are semi-hardware...
