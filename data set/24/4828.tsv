2007-01-09T12:46:00.000Z	Raythiest		then someone must know?
2007-01-09T12:47:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	doesn't that make you truely an idiot also?
2007-01-09T12:47:00.000Z	Raythiest	variant	probably.... lol
2007-01-09T12:49:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	the fact is that linux doesn't creat a dev entry for eth devices.. they are created in software only
2007-01-09T12:49:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	use ethtool and ifconfig to administer it
2007-01-09T12:49:00.000Z	Raythiest	variant	maybe not ubuntu...... .most linux's do
2007-01-09T12:50:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	wrong, no linuxes that I know of do
2007-01-09T12:50:00.000Z	Raythiest	variant	ummm...... i boot 7 different os's and ubuntu is the ONLY one that doesnt
2007-01-09T12:51:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	only if you created it your self. I can _assure_ you that it doesnt (the linux kernel network stack)
2007-01-09T12:51:00.000Z	Raythiest	variant	haha.... your so lost
2007-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	variant	Raythiest	I suggest you reboot to one of your many distroes and take a look in /dev/ for anything called eth0. you will be very upset
2007-01-09T12:52:00.000Z	Raythiest	variant	would you like multiple screenshots?
