2007-03-12T05:10:00.000Z	Vince_		Ok its a BIOSTAR M7NCG 400
2007-03-12T05:12:00.000Z	Vince_		VOX754: It works for everything else
2007-03-12T05:13:00.000Z	Vince_		Anyone?
2007-03-12T05:14:00.000Z	Vince_		And it works fine
2007-03-12T05:15:00.000Z	Vince_		BTW I can install breazy up to a point.  However then It won't let me out of the area where I need to setup my User Account
2007-03-12T05:15:00.000Z	Vince_		SO I know it can load it
2007-03-12T05:17:00.000Z	Vince_		If I get knoppix running thats well and good but I don't know how it tells me anything on how to get Ubuntu Running
2007-03-12T05:18:00.000Z	Vince_		Vox754: I have no idea how old it is.. a few years.  But as I said i've HAD Ubuntu running on this before
2007-03-12T05:19:00.000Z	Vince_		Prevone: No. And i'm not going too untill its a stable release with some documentation behind it.  Otherwise I can't use it.
2007-03-12T05:20:00.000Z	Vince_		Look.. Let me ask this...  If I started Knoppix from one drive and then load the Ubuntu CD and mounted it from knoppix couild I run the install from there?
2007-03-12T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 that may be a bit hard.
2007-03-12T05:21:00.000Z	Vince_	Dr_willis	If you have another idea i'm all ears.  No one else seems to have a clue why it won't just install from the CD
2007-03-12T05:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 theres  a lot of very odd/hardcore/weird/freaky ways to install ubuntu.   if you got a 2nd pc. you could try a net boot.
2007-03-12T05:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 of course ya could always try swapping around cdrom drives... or just run it in vmware for a while to learn the system.. or try feisty see if it has the same problem.
2007-03-12T05:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 in like a month it will be consiodered supported.. so..   do whatever you feel comfortable with. You could use vmware to INSTALL it to a real hard drive. :) then try booting the hd.
2007-03-12T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 may want to try a can of compressed air and cleaning out the drive.. and perhaps test the disk on another machine.
2007-03-12T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 or 'virtualbox'  its free.. and vmware has a free version.
2007-03-12T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 sounds almost like the ide controller, or cable issue.
2007-03-12T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 ive seen weirder things happen.
2007-03-12T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 ive also heard that a lot of the  motherboards made in the last few years have capaciator issues.. but heck - for all we know its a  odd hardware/bios/kernel bug.
2007-03-12T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 ive also seen examples of installing ubuntu with the debootstrap stuff
2007-03-12T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 have the virtual machine 'access' the real drive.. its a vmware setting rather trivial
2007-03-12T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 yep. thats an issue.
2007-03-12T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Vince_	 perhaps..  or use a .iso file of the installer cd.
