2011-04-22T11:16:00.000Z	Flynn		In Ubuntu 10 what is the location of /home?
2011-04-22T11:17:00.000Z	Flynn		Yeah, but how do I see it?
2011-04-22T11:17:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	unless you made a separate partition for it, at the root of your partition. To see it, `ls /home`.
2011-04-22T11:17:00.000Z	Flynn		In files and folders can I see it/
2011-04-22T11:18:00.000Z	Flynn		?
2011-04-22T11:18:00.000Z	Flynn		Regular Dave:  Thanx.
2011-04-22T11:18:00.000Z	Flynn		I don't see it on mine.
2011-04-22T11:20:00.000Z	Flynn		It returns lost +found
2011-04-22T11:20:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	ls /home returns lost+found? what about your username??
2011-04-22T11:20:00.000Z	Flynn		lost+found user
2011-04-22T11:21:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	lost+found is normal. Looks like it's all ok...?
2011-04-22T11:21:00.000Z	Flynn		When I open "Files and Folders" theres no folder called Home
2011-04-22T11:23:00.000Z	Flynn	gaelfx	 I understand /home is like c:// in windows.
2011-04-22T11:23:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	that's not the place for it? If you want to get to the home directory go through root ( ' / ' ), but it's just a holder for user `profiles' , such as 'user'. Are you looking for the /home directory or for 'your' home folder?
2011-04-22T11:24:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	C:\ ~= ' / '
2011-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	Flynn		Ok I want to see all the files and folders in my linux partition
2011-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	To search, or do you just want a list?
2011-04-22T11:25:00.000Z	Flynn		Not sure I think its 10.10
2011-04-22T11:26:00.000Z	Flynn		Where's places?
2011-04-22T11:26:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	places is up on your gnome-panel, next to applications, or in a nautilus window, on the left pane.
2011-04-22T11:27:00.000Z	Flynn		I have workspaces, files and folders, and applications, no "places"
2011-04-22T11:28:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	oooh, you aren't using ubuntu desktop?
2011-04-22T11:28:00.000Z	Flynn		Netbook version
2011-04-22T11:28:00.000Z	joshmc	Flynn	so open up a filemanager window.
