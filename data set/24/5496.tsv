2012-07-05T11:29:00.000Z	fidel	lion	language? ;)
2012-07-09T17:27:00.000Z	fidel	lion	what part dont you understand?
2012-07-09T17:27:00.000Z	fidel	lion	change your apt-sources
2012-07-09T17:28:00.000Z	fidel	lion	disable the install CD as source and enable the default online sources - rerun apt-get update && apt-get upgrade and you are most likely done
2012-07-09T17:32:00.000Z	fidel	lion	what do you expect from the cmd you entered to do?
2012-07-09T17:34:00.000Z	fidel	lion	we were talking about reading the CONTENT of the FILE /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-07-09T17:35:00.000Z	fidel	lion	please dont get me wrong - but just repeating commands from irc without knowing what they do - might be dangerous with bad luck
2012-07-10T17:31:00.000Z	fidel	lion	how is that an ubuntu question?
2012-07-10T17:35:00.000Z	fidel	lion	the question: why cant you create comments in your acrobat on linux?
2012-07-10T17:40:00.000Z	fidel	lion	so your actual question is: does acrobat 9 on linux supports the comment-function?
2012-07-10T17:41:00.000Z	fidel	lion	cause thats the way to check
2012-07-10T17:41:00.000Z	fidel	lion	besides: i just installed acrobat 9 for testing it - and i do see a comment button - not sure if it works - as i really dont care ... but there is one in the sidebar ;)
2012-07-10T17:43:00.000Z	fidel	lion	maybe use a search for alternative linux opdf readers- random hit: http://maketecheasier.com/8-alternative-pdf-readers-for-your-consideration/2010/11/12
2012-07-10T17:47:00.000Z	fidel	lion	either write a mail to adobe and wait for ever without getting a reply - or search a solution yourself. best solutiuon is most likely choosing something not crappy as adobe itself as alternative reader
