2009-03-21T02:03:00.000Z	stealth-		were is the bash interpreter? Im looking to start a file with #!/usr/wherever/bash/is
2009-03-21T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	which bash
2009-03-21T02:04:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	obey_me: I dont know :| Im running echo and rsync, pretty much
2009-03-21T02:04:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	just run "which bash" in a terminal.. which tells you where the binary is
2009-03-21T02:05:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	bigrigger, obey_me: Okay, I got it. Thanks guys.
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	is it the same for windows, then?
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	no, ext3 is a bit more clever about where it puts the file blocks compared to ntfs..
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	ah. okay. I was partially correct, then
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	thanks
2009-05-18T01:12:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	I've only heard of people having fragmentation problems with almost full drives that have files written, deleted, grown constantly.. mail queues and such..
2009-05-18T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	but if you keep at least 10% free space you wont see any problems for a long time
2009-05-18T01:13:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	ah okay. I was wondering why there was no talk about defrag often here. Yeah, I got a huge harddisk I hardly use any part of.
2009-08-08T14:31:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	in system, preferences, sound
2009-08-08T14:32:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	I did change that, and it works for most things, but things like firefox still play through onboard
2009-08-08T14:32:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	and the audio applet still controls onboard, too
2009-08-08T14:33:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	ah.. it's probably pulseaudio then.. run this in a terminal "sudo apt-get install padevchooser pavucontrol"
2009-08-08T14:34:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	then go to Applications, Sound & Video and find PulseAudio Volume Control.. start that and you'll be able to change where the firefox sound is played.. you have to have a sound playing when you do that though.. so find a webpage, youtube will do, and then adjust the setting.. It should stick so the next time you wont have to change it
2009-08-08T14:34:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	k, thanks. ill check that out. man, from what i've heard, pulse audio seems to do more harm than good :/
2009-08-08T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	nah.. it's got its flaws.. but for multiple sound cards it's great
2009-08-08T14:38:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	okay, I got that working, but any clue how to get the gnome sound applet to default to controlling the sblive card?
2009-08-08T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	right click on it and select preferences.. there you can select which card it controls
2009-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	oh, wow. that was ridiculously easy. Sorry about bothering you for that. lol, I thought I would be having to mess with some config stuff to get this working, didn't expect pulse audio to work as well as it did.
2009-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	stealth-	Slart	thanks for all the help
2009-08-08T14:40:00.000Z	Slart	stealth-	no worries.. if I didn't want to be bothered I wouldn't be here.. glad it worked out for you
