2007-10-20T09:09:00.000Z	rickjones		hi all, i'm trying to install edgy on a new system ( new to me ) and everything goes fine till i try to use the command " lspci" nothing happens. also, the realtec nic is not being detected, in fact NOTHING is being detected. is there a way to `force` edgy to detect hardwaRE?
2007-10-20T09:10:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	I'd double check the install
2007-10-20T09:10:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	lspci is a very low level command, it interacts with the kernel
2007-10-20T09:11:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	yeah, it is downloadable
2007-10-20T09:12:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: where is this alt. cd ?
2007-10-20T09:13:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: this will detect and support my realtek nic ?
2007-10-20T09:13:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	it's hard to say. Realtek NICs shouldn't have a problem.
2007-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	they both use the same kernel though, so I would say probably not, but you don't have many other choices =P
2007-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	the fact that lspci doesn't output anything though indicates something is wrong
2007-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: could it be the hardware isn't being detected due to some bios setting
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	yeah, but it should detect your chipset and everything else either way
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: will lspci work in 'live' user mode ?
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	but you're right, bios could play a role
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	'live'? you mean livecd?
2007-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: yes. livecd , sorry
2007-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	it should. once the kernel is loaded, there shouldn't be any problems with hardware-kernel interations
2007-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	: lspci outputs nothing
2007-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	try resetting your bios to default settings, and also look online to see if other people have problems using the same mobo
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	there's not much we can do... check the md5sum of your liveCDs as well
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	fair enough. i'm downloading the alt cd now to burn
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	or use that option at the boot menu
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	option ?
2007-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	Talcite	rickjones	I seem to remember an option at the boot menu to check the integrity of the cd
2007-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	rickjones	Talcite	i go now to reset bios to default
