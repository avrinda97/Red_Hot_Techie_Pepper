2009-06-18T17:07:00.000Z	sipior	petx	if i understand your question correctly, you can specify an alias interface using a colon: ifconfig eth0:0 <ip address> netmask ...
2009-06-18T17:08:00.000Z	petx	sipior	sry.. my english is bad...
2009-06-18T17:23:00.000Z	petx	sipior	I'm confused...
2009-06-18T17:24:00.000Z	sipior	petx	regarding what?
2009-06-18T17:24:00.000Z	petx	sipior	using the colon...
2009-06-18T17:25:00.000Z	sipior	petx	how are you attempting to set the aliased ip address?
2009-06-18T17:27:00.000Z	petx	sipior	I dont know about aliased ip address... maybe I understand... I want to set my IP to different subnet... one 255.255.0.0... and another 255.255.255.0
2009-06-18T17:28:00.000Z	sipior	petx	well, those are netmasks, not subnets exactly.
2009-06-18T17:28:00.000Z	petx	sipior	ups... sry...
2009-06-18T17:28:00.000Z	petx	sipior	I meant netmask...
2009-06-18T17:28:00.000Z	sipior	petx	perhaps you can explain what your current configuration is, and then mention what you want to change?
2009-06-18T17:29:00.000Z	petx	sipior	ok... I'll explain my config.
2009-06-18T17:30:00.000Z	petx	sipior	my IP is 192.168.2.250, netmask 255.255.255.0... it's my ISP network...
2009-06-18T17:31:00.000Z	petx	sipior	then I want to add the IP on netmask 255.255.0.0... It's another network...
2009-06-18T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	petx	why not just use another /24 network? this is a home network, i presume?
2009-06-18T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	petx	you can just try something like: "sudo ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
2009-06-18T17:34:00.000Z	sipior	petx	also make sure that an appropriate entry for the second subnet can be found in your routing table (/sbin/route -n)
2009-06-18T17:34:00.000Z	petx	sipior	hmm... one is my ISP network... another is my campus network... so we use different networks...
2009-06-18T17:35:00.000Z	sipior	petx	i see. then i assume you're using dhcp to get an address on the campus network? you can try dhclient eth0:0.
2009-06-18T17:36:00.000Z	sipior	petx	although in this case, how are you connected to each network? are you sure you need an aliased interface?
2009-06-18T17:36:00.000Z	petx	sipior	yups
2009-06-18T17:38:00.000Z	petx	sipior	I need the 255.255.255.0 to connect to internet... and 255.255.0.0 to my network... I hope u understand what I said... T_T
2009-06-18T17:38:00.000Z	petx	sipior	sry my English is so bad...
2009-06-18T17:40:00.000Z	petx	sipior	hmm... emergency call... w8 a moment... ^^
