2008-03-31T18:57:00.000Z	Creationist		Anyone know how to install the nonfree flash plugin in Firefox 3?
2008-03-31T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	what version of ubuntu?
2008-03-31T18:57:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	It's Hardy (yes, I'm asking in #ubuntu+1 but no one knows)
2008-03-31T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	people are answering your question there
2008-04-28T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04/release/
2008-04-28T17:53:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	You know, I JUST found that page too :)  But thank you.
2008-04-28T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	more available (all of the main repository)
2008-04-28T17:54:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	So installing from the DVD will still give me the identical system as from CD?
2008-04-28T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	it should
2008-05-06T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	use find (or use the zsh shell's extra globbing abilities)
2008-05-06T04:18:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	Can I pipe the rm command into find?
2008-05-06T04:27:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	search for "-not" on the page.  /-not<enter>
2008-05-06T04:27:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	thank you
2008-05-06T04:28:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	However, that wasn't found :)
2008-05-06T04:28:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	hit 'g' and try again...
2008-05-06T04:28:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	Ah... learning new stuff all the time.  THanks.
2008-05-06T04:31:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	When the man page says "expr" is that saying I use a regex for that?
2008-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	no I don't think so.  I think you can do -not -name foo.  I'm not sure on this.  Play with it
2008-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	Alright.... thanks again :)
2008-05-07T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	pastebin why you think they are broken
2008-05-07T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	actually, just see the /topic
2008-05-07T00:52:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	They don't download or are very slow.  Yeah, I know the topic says there are issues, but it doesn't say when they'll be resolved or how to work around them.
2008-05-07T00:53:00.000Z	jrib	Creationist	yes it does, use a local mirror
2008-05-07T00:54:00.000Z	Creationist	jrib	Oh, I didn't see that yesterday.  Thanks.
