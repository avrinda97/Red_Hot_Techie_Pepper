2008-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	unable to write to directory /etc/X11
2008-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	then i sudo'd it and it did it i think
2008-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	put sudo before
2008-11-02T14:11:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	then ctrl+alt+F7.. then "ctrl+alt+backspace"
2008-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	just shows the characters ^[H or something
2008-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	then "ctrl+alt+f1" then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
2008-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	do you know if there's any way i can copy and paste when i'm like this? it would make things much easier lol
2008-11-02T14:15:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	"sudo apt-get install pastebinit" .. then you can "pastebinit <command like ls -al>"
2008-11-02T14:16:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	where should i enter that sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart command? just a cmd line?
2008-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	yes
2008-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	it restarted it and my screen flashed a couple times
2008-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	and still no graphics?
2008-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	not to my knowledge. irssi is still up and the other windows are cmd lines
2008-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	what about "ctrl+alt+F7"
2008-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	that's still just a completely blank window except for what i've entered and a blinking underline.
2008-11-02T14:21:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	ok.. back to F1.. try "nvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info"
2008-11-02T14:22:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	by f1 do you mean ctrl + alt + f1? or just any cmd line?
2008-11-02T14:22:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	any command line.. usually most will go with ctrl+alt+f1
2008-11-02T14:24:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	WARNING: error opening libnvidia-cfg.so 1: cannot open because no such file or directory basically
2008-11-02T14:26:00.000Z	djhash	fallore_	i think the problem is that the installation of restricted drivers didnt go well.. i dont know what you need to type to remove it..
2008-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	fallore_	djhash	that sucks :[ lol
