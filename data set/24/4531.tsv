2007-04-07T16:24:00.000Z	brainiac8008		i have dapper and want to upgrade to edgy from a disc.  Can I do so by putting the Edgy Live CD into my drive and putting in a command in the terminal or do I have to get something called an Edgy Alternate Install CD, and if so, how do I get one?
2007-04-07T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	but it's easier to forget the fancy menu based stuff, and just go here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.10/
2007-04-07T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	You'll have to add the CD as a repository, but yes.  Actually, what does it say it can't fetch?
2007-04-07T16:35:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	are you fully up to date in Dapper?
2007-04-07T16:42:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	are you fully up to date with dapper?
2007-04-07T16:41:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	Oh.  The alt CD wouldn't help, since your problem is with third party repositories
2007-04-07T16:44:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	what errors do they give?
2007-04-07T16:45:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	yeah
2007-04-07T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	That's some universe package.  Try removing it.  And that has nothing to do with cairo.  What makes you think youre having issues with cairo?
2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	ah, right.  Uh, do a apt-cache policy libcairo2  which repository is it coming from?
2007-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	right.  that issue wih libcairo is because of the beryl repositories.  It's seeing the new versions (in beryl repos), but keeping you at the dapper oen (with the *** next to it)
2007-04-08T11:54:00.000Z	brainiac8008	Flannel	hey, it's brainiac here. you remember me?  do you know what i should do about all of my issues?
2007-04-08T11:55:00.000Z	brainiac8008	Flannel	hey, it's brainiac here. you remember me?  do you know what i should do about all of my issues?
2007-07-15T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	sudo visudo /etc/sudoers
2007-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	visudo is the editor
2007-07-15T10:45:00.000Z	brainiac8008	Flannel	okay.  I think I talked to you quite a while ago about something.  can't remember what it was tho.  :)
2007-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	brainiac8008	Flannel	I got this:  usage: visudo [-c]  [-f sudoers]  [-q]  [-s]  [-V] 
2007-07-15T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	I'm sorry.  It's just "sudo visudo", no path
2007-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	# lines are comments, spacing is just for readability.
2007-07-15T10:52:00.000Z	brainiac8008	Flannel	so I don't need the # if I change, say, the timestamp_timeout (i.e. how long sudo remembers my password for administrative tasks)?
2007-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	Everything on a line after a # is ignored as a comment
2007-07-15T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	everyone after a # is ignored
2007-07-15T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	No.  Everything with a # infront of it is ignored.  Everything without isnt
2007-07-15T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	brainiac8008	er, yes to what you said.  You just said it in a roundabout way
