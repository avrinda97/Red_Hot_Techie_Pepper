2006-03-30T07:13:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	make sure 'java -version' doesn't mention libgcj, and make sure `iptables -L` doesn't say policy drop
2006-03-30T07:33:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	points to the current directory
2006-03-30T07:42:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	well, the azureus tar.gz contains a directory called "azureus" which contains an executable script called "azureus"
2006-03-30T07:43:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	err, so you renamed that script to azureus.sh and moved it to ~/Azureus?
2006-03-30T07:44:00.000Z	jadaz87	void^	no i did not
2006-03-30T07:45:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	but it's neither called azureus.sh nor in a directory called Azureus
2006-03-30T07:46:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	doesn't it have a browse button that allows you to simply select the file?
2006-03-30T07:46:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	well, find where your `azureus' file is, point exactly to this file.
2006-03-30T07:49:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	no, you're not supposed to rename the extracted azureus directory, he was talking about the azureus config dir (which was hidden to begin with)
2006-03-30T07:51:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	it's an archive. if you extracted it you get a folder with files in it, one of these files is the azureus script. run it
2006-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	jadaz87	void^	ok hold on
2006-03-30T07:57:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	start using it?
2006-03-30T07:57:00.000Z	jadaz87	void^	what about the configuration folder you were talking abotu before?
2006-03-30T07:58:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	i wasn't, and you don't have to worry about it, really
2006-03-30T08:01:00.000Z	jadaz87	void^	no what about the launcher
2006-03-30T08:02:00.000Z	void^	jadaz87	make it launch that script
