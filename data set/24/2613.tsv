2008-11-05T15:53:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		it is offtopic to moan and whine about ubuntu in #ubuntu
2008-11-05T15:53:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		ESPECIALLY when you don't use it
2008-11-05T15:53:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		it would be worth it to keep you out.
2008-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		I am still trying to get dialog windows to pop up above preexisting windows (rather than below)
2008-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		for those who have good ideas...
2008-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	too hard, next :)
2008-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		haha
2008-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	what DE?
2008-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	siccness		or better yet, what WM?
2008-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		mostly ubuntu 8.04 default (gnome)
2008-11-05T15:55:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		I want to say metacity, but I am not sure
2008-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	siccness		yeah what WM is that, nmh-j2graw?
2008-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	siccness		sorry, i dont know much about ubuntu and it's defaults
2008-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw	siccness	me too...
2008-11-05T15:57:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	done a patch update on metacity?
2008-11-05T15:57:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw	siccness	not that I know of
2008-11-05T15:58:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	someone has suggested this "under gen options, change the level of focus stealing to low"
2008-11-05T15:58:00.000Z	siccness		but ill be damned if i know what "gen" options is
2008-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw	siccness	hey, what a neat idea - I know I saw that option somewhere...
2008-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	that could well be the key
2008-11-05T16:06:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw	siccness	well, for my test case of one window, it seems to have done the trick
2008-11-05T16:06:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw		great suggestion, thanks!
2008-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	siccness	nmh-j2graw	so...what do you think of me now? :)
2008-11-05T16:08:00.000Z	nmh-j2graw	siccness	before: helpful, now: helpful-er ?
