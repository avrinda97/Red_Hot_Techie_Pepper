2006-07-06T10:18:00.000Z	Tloric		I"m sure its been asked a half million times, but i'm having trouble finding the answer on the net. My dapper wont keep my domain name and DNS servers for more than 30 seconds. Where is a fix?
2006-07-06T10:18:00.000Z	kaot	Tloric	are you setting something different than what you're getting via dhcp?
2006-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	kaot		zcat[1] : unless you have a legitimate need for imap, you probably don't really want it.
2006-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	kaot		zcat[1] : you might *think* you want it
2006-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	kaot		zcat[1] : but then you'll get it, and wish you hadn't.
2006-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	kaot		trust me
2006-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	kaot		:\
2006-07-06T10:22:00.000Z	kaot		zcat[1] : that's what your mail client is for :\
2006-07-06T10:22:00.000Z	Tloric		Kaot, its just not keeping the DNS server info or my home network's domain.  otherwise everything's fine.
2006-07-06T10:22:00.000Z	kaot		zcat[1] : ssh in and use pine  :P
2006-07-06T10:23:00.000Z	Tloric		dont understand the question sys.
2006-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	Tloric		Sys8976: nothing is right now except the network manager.  Which wont keep the settings longer than 30 seconds.
2006-07-06T10:27:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	If i understand the question, Yes.
2006-07-06T10:29:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	Ubuntu dapper
2006-07-06T10:29:00.000Z	Tloric		lateset
2006-07-06T10:32:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	Normal network manager that i've been using.
2006-07-06T10:33:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	eth0 is active
2006-07-06T10:34:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	Yes.
2006-07-06T10:34:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	and its enabled.
2006-07-06T10:35:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	yes i do.
2006-07-06T10:39:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	Its on another machine so cant past it here. Right now its holding the right address and mask.  (wouldnt hold a connection long enough for me to get on irc with it).
2006-07-06T10:40:00.000Z	kaot		I got wine to run pokerstars.  mission accomplished as far as wine goes.  hehe
2006-07-06T10:40:00.000Z	Tloric	sys8976	Dont suppose there's a way to turn off ip6 and go to ip4?  I seem to remember the last release worked just fine with that.
2006-07-06T10:40:00.000Z	kaot	Tloric	remove ipv6 support from teh kernel, probably
