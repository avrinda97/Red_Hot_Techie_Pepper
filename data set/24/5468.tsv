2009-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	style	depends what your bottle neck is, normally desktop performance is diven by your video card
2009-01-07T23:22:00.000Z	ikonia	style	in relation to what ?
2009-01-07T23:22:00.000Z	style	ikonia	bether performance for bitorrent and desktop, and ssh usage
2009-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	style	ikonia	I have a Nvidia fx 440
2009-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	style	that is quite old
2009-01-07T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	style	actually - is that a geforce 4 ?
2009-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	style	ikonia	It is quite old. It is an old box.
2009-01-07T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	style	I suspect that is your visual bottle neck
2009-01-07T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	style	are you using ubuntu or debian ?
2009-01-07T23:29:00.000Z	style	ikonia	Currently debian, will instal ubuntu interpid in about haf an houre
2009-01-07T23:29:00.000Z	ikonia	style	then please get support from #debian
2009-01-07T23:30:00.000Z	style	ikonia	I am asking about things to prepare me for the upgrade. I haven't asked a single debian question!
2009-01-07T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	style	your asking performance questions, which I assume is about your current install
2009-01-07T23:30:00.000Z	style	ikonia	No, it is about my future ubuntu install.
2009-01-07T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	style	then install it first to find out if you have performance issues
2009-01-07T23:31:00.000Z	style	ikonia	A lot of work if someone here knows it won't work
2009-01-08T00:39:00.000Z	style	ikonia	For ps3?
2009-01-08T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	style	there is a PS4 specific version - again community driven, not official
2009-01-08T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	style	PS3 sory
2009-01-08T00:40:00.000Z	style	ikonia	I would be truly impressed if ubuntu had a PS4 version even before the console was released:P
