2008-12-04T04:35:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	My monitor is flat screen
2008-12-04T04:35:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	check the back of the monitor, find the horiz-sync value and then check the xorg.conf file , see if they match , that might be the problem
2008-12-04T04:37:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	I cannot find the word horiz-sync on the back
2008-12-04T04:38:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	might be just a H  should be at 60hzt or something
2008-12-04T04:38:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	have you ever been able to get this monitor to use a higher resolution before ?
2008-12-04T04:40:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	The monitor reconizes 1152x864
2008-12-04T04:40:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	dig your manual or find your monitor's speck on the internet , find the refresh rate , that is usualy the problem,  also check the xorg.conf file, if there are resolutions listed under device screen, you might want to add the ones you want manualy
2008-12-04T04:49:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	I cannot find the specs. How do i (correctly) add the modes manually?
2008-12-04T04:51:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	I cannot find the specs. How do i (correctly) add the modes manually?
2008-12-04T04:51:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	try  , sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ( that's X One one , not X LL ) linux is case sensitive ,   seeif you have rez listed in there, if not , I would refrain from adding them manualy,  there is a command at the top of the file to reconfigure xorg,  try that instead
2008-12-04T04:51:00.000Z	Pelo	dbdii407	you need to learn a bit of patience,  and give ppl time to type the replies
2008-12-04T04:51:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	Np. Hang on
2008-12-04T04:52:00.000Z	dbdii407	Pelo	Sorry. There is no modes listed.
