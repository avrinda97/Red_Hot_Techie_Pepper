2006-09-27T12:04:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 how can i install that version of firefox on my ubuntu?
2006-09-27T12:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade should do the trick if firefox is already installed...
2006-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 it does not work
2006-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	does it spit out an error? if it's long, paste it in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	(and then tell me the url pastebin gives you)
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 my firefox version is 1.0.5.4
2006-09-27T12:12:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 if i give the command upgrade it says me to dl 250 megs
2006-09-27T12:12:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 have no sapce
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	ok, then the problem is that you have a) too many unneccessary packages installed or b) too many random files. if you do the command df -h, you can see just how much space you have left
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	one thing you could do is archive rarely-accessed files
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	another is delete things you no longer use
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	you might also run the command sudo apt-get autoclean to free some space
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	does any of that help?
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 20 mb free
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	ok, so please try some of the things that i suggested just above here.
2006-09-27T12:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	right, so delete some of the crap that's taking up room on your harddrive. common sense--if you have no room, it won't magically appear; you need to make room. i assume your /home is not on a separate partition (if you don't know what i'm talking about, then it's not on a separate partition)
2006-09-27T12:17:00.000Z	nodo	ladydoor	 i have only 2 parts
2006-09-27T12:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	ok, yes or no (i don't have much time to be patient):  is your /home on a separate partition from /?
2006-09-27T12:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	if you don't know, then the correct answer is no
2006-09-27T12:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	nodo	ok! time's up. i've got to go. good luck.
