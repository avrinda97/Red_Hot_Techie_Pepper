2010-02-19T00:35:00.000Z	Almark		hello
2010-02-19T00:36:00.000Z	Almark		I'm needing a certain file on a ubuntu cdrom, instead of having to just look for it online its already on my cdrom how do I find it among the mass of deb packages
2010-02-19T00:36:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	what is the file? is it required for a config or make?
2010-02-19T00:37:00.000Z	Almark		its sources.list for a ubuntu disto but I just need that default file
2010-02-19T00:37:00.000Z	Almark		inveratulo_ will that look inside the deb packages because that is where the file resides
2010-02-19T00:37:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	oh. that's important :)
2010-02-19T00:37:00.000Z	Almark		inveratulo_ I did try that but that doesn't search each deb
2010-02-19T00:37:00.000Z	Almark		lol
2010-02-19T00:38:00.000Z	Almark	_UsUrPeR_	I was thinking that maybe a nice script would be handy for something like this
2010-02-19T00:39:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	sorry, bud. I've never lost a sources.list file before... I can pastebin mine for you :)
2010-02-19T00:39:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_		I have no idea where it's located on the cd...
2010-02-19T00:39:00.000Z	Almark	_UsUrPeR_	I have one but I need the default for my distro
2010-02-19T00:40:00.000Z	Almark		inveratulo_ yeah its a deb package but which one, what door to open lol
2010-02-19T00:40:00.000Z	Almark		inveratulo_ what is RHEL
2010-02-19T00:40:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	the only changes between distros is the postfix. I.E. "deb http://dlws/ubuntu/ hardy-updates main restricted" would be for hardy while "deb http://dlws/ubuntu/ karmic-updates main restricted" would be for karmic
2010-02-19T00:41:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_		err not postfix. :)
2010-02-19T00:41:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_		posterior? :)
2010-02-19T00:42:00.000Z	Almark	_UsUrPeR_	I'm using Hardy actually
2010-02-19T00:42:00.000Z	Almark	_UsUrPeR_	and you could check that and find the pkg name and then I can go from there?
2010-02-19T00:42:00.000Z	Almark		Losha_ how would I go about using apt to find that package?
2010-02-19T00:43:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	I am running hardy...
2010-02-19T00:44:00.000Z	Almark		VCoolio_ thanks :)
2010-02-19T00:44:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_	Almark	http://pastebin.com/m35b58ed2 that's my hardy sources.list
2010-02-19T00:45:00.000Z	Almark	_UsUrPeR_	thanks :)
