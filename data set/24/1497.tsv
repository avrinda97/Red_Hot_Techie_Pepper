2009-12-16T02:19:00.000Z	com3	epinky	i keep on getting the grub menu whenever i try to boot to ubunut.
2009-12-16T02:20:00.000Z	epinky	com3	change boot order on BIOS
2009-12-16T02:21:00.000Z	com3	epinky	did that, I cannot boot from the live CD, i've managed to install it on an external HDD, it booted fine, followed the steps posted on some forum to fix my issue, but it didnt work. is there a way to fix the issue from windows?
2009-12-16T02:22:00.000Z	epinky	com3	is it a laptop?
2009-12-16T02:22:00.000Z	com3	epinky	yeah an acer extensa
2009-12-16T02:23:00.000Z	com3	epinky	to be honest i dont know what made it stop working. it just did one day
2009-12-16T02:23:00.000Z	epinky	com3	are you sure boot order is correct?, DVD Drive must go first F12 or f10 to select  boot order at runtime
2009-12-16T02:26:00.000Z	com3	epinky	when i boof from the CD i get the ubuntu prompt and everything, i chose the first option, then it stoppes working giving me an error. it just freezes there, my question is regarding grub, when i go into the ubuntu folder, there is nothing under /ubuntu/disks/boot/grub the folder is empty,, what could have caused that?
2009-12-16T02:27:00.000Z	epinky	com3	is it karmic(9.10)?
2009-12-16T02:28:00.000Z	com3		yeah
2009-12-16T02:28:00.000Z	com3		is there a tool besides grubfixer that could solve my issue?
2009-12-16T02:28:00.000Z	epinky		!grub2 |  com3
2009-12-16T02:29:00.000Z	com3		ill check it out. thanks
2009-12-16T02:30:00.000Z	com3	epinky	the thing is i cannot boot into ubuntu i keep on getting the grub screen, how can i fix it from there, and why did the files disappear
2009-12-16T02:31:00.000Z	epinky	com3	did you reinstall something in WIInDoS?
2009-12-16T02:32:00.000Z	com3	epinky	nop,, i wasnt using windows when ubuntu was working, i just ran the update tool in ubuntu, restarted and the thing just stopped working
2009-12-16T02:34:00.000Z	epinky	com3	where does boot process stop?
2009-12-16T02:35:00.000Z	com3	epinky	after selecting ubuntu from the bootloader. it just runs the grub menu
2009-12-16T02:36:00.000Z	epinky	com3	I mean the LIVECD, you will need it(to boot from LiveCD)
2009-12-16T02:37:00.000Z	com3	epinky	the live CD halts on the ubuntu logo, with the line beneath it, when i press ecs i get a message telling me command line error #3 or something of the sorts
2009-12-16T02:38:00.000Z	com3		epingky can i boot from VMware or something like that?
2009-12-16T02:39:00.000Z	epinky	com3	well, I will need the error to find out the problem, "something like that" is very ambiguous, don't know what you want to do, but every Virtual machine is isolated by default
2009-12-16T02:42:00.000Z	com3	epinky	hmm, ok, if i were to backup the /ubuntu/disks folder, then reinstall ubuntu, then place the backed up folders in its place will everything go back to normal?
