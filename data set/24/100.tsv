2012-07-24T16:14:00.000Z	folmer		is Ubuntu regarded as a lightweight distro?
2012-07-24T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	it can be
2012-07-24T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	in what way? The question is too vague
2012-07-24T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	Win7 is nearly 10Gb installed, a full Ubuntu install is about 4Gb
2012-07-24T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	if you want light then install minimal then install fluxbox, it will give a super light OS but will require more work from you for config
2012-07-24T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	ask in ##windows for windows support
2012-07-24T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	you can just install lubuntu-desktop and get the same, there is no difference in the underlying OS between Lubuntu and Ubuntu
2012-07-24T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	agen is fairly irrelevant, all you need is the system specs. What CPU speed and RAM do you have?
2012-07-24T16:24:00.000Z	folmer	ActionParsnip	core 2 duo (1.8 or so), 2gb ram
2012-07-24T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	thats more than anything I have, you'll be fine
2012-07-24T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	what video chip?
2012-07-24T16:27:00.000Z	folmer	ActionParsnip	I don't know. Crap intel integrated, probably not the newest even for it's time (2007)
2012-07-24T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	should be ok then
2012-07-24T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	Ubuntu isn't a big RAM hog like Windows
2012-07-24T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	i've seen more than that
2012-07-24T16:32:00.000Z	folmer	ActionParsnip	I would think it wasn't. That's why I went with Linux in the first place. But it's still somewhat lacking. Possibly I jut have too high standards, but I'm exploring the possibilities if I'm doing something horribly wrong by using standard Ubuntu
2012-07-24T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	try logging in to Unity2D and the UI should be faster
2012-07-24T16:34:00.000Z	folmer	ActionParsnip	I've tried Unity 2D. Not really any improvement
2012-07-24T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	You could install lubuntu-desktop package, log off and log in to the lubuntu session
2012-07-24T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	none at all, you can use any apps in any DE too
2012-07-24T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	also lots of native games
2012-07-24T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	I've head diablo3 runs, no idea what swtor is..
2012-07-24T16:41:00.000Z	folmer	ActionParsnip	Starwars the old republic
2012-07-24T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	folmer	http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=7626 doesn't seem to work in crossoiver so it's likely to not ruin in wine
