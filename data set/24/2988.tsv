2008-06-02T08:28:00.000Z	janice8954		Guys I have a huge problem. I tried to install a GDM theme on Hardy and now when I boot the loggin screen doesn't load. It just loads an orange screen and the busy pointer.
2008-06-02T08:28:00.000Z	janice8954		anyone have any ideas?
2008-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Can you still type in your username and password?
2008-06-02T08:29:00.000Z	janice8954		no, it's not loading anything.
2008-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Then I have no idea. You have no other way to login?
2008-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	janice8954		Nope.
2008-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	janice8954		startx is not even loading.
2008-06-02T08:30:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Wow... That's of the wierdness ><
2008-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	janice8954		That loads a desktop but when I try to  start the login window deal it says that gdm is not running.
2008-06-02T08:31:00.000Z	janice8954		So now I am lost. I would do a fresh install but that would wipe out all my file and I can't have that happen.
2008-06-02T08:32:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Have you tried typing $sudo gdm-setup     in a terminal?
2008-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	janice8954		RICE: no, standbye let me try that.
2008-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Alright. If it gives you the average gdm settings screen, switch back to a trusted theme and check the other theme's directory.
2008-06-02T08:34:00.000Z	janice8954		Okay, thatnks
2008-06-02T08:35:00.000Z	janice8954		I think someone else said something about that before, I couldn't find the site that said it. Wouldn't you know it.
2008-06-02T08:35:00.000Z	janice8954		Would anyone know how to get an ATI radeon 7000 working in Kubuntu?
2008-06-02T08:38:00.000Z	janice8954	[RICE]	it tells me that command cannot be found. Mind you an I am Shell prompt from the recovery menu
2008-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Ahmm... >< I don't know what else to try.
2008-06-02T08:40:00.000Z	janice8954		 frelling weird. Maybe if I try running it from the desktop that startx brings up
2008-06-02T08:40:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Yes, it would then.
2008-06-02T08:40:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	PROBABLY
2008-06-02T08:41:00.000Z	janice8954		I don't know. I tried something similar and it said that gdm was not running.
2008-06-02T08:42:00.000Z	janice8954		now when I run the startx a thing comes up saying "This session is running as as privileged user.
2008-06-02T08:43:00.000Z	[RICE]	janice8954	Just means you're running the x session with root privaleges.
