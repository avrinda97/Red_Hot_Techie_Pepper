2008-08-26T17:06:00.000Z	ChrisPoland		I installed the codecs here, https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/codecs.html
2008-08-26T17:07:00.000Z	ChrisPoland		after reading here, https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html#dvdplayback
2008-08-26T17:09:00.000Z	ChrisPoland		anyone know how to control what frame nautilus takes a video frame from?
2008-08-26T17:10:00.000Z	ChrisPoland		thanks anyway slart
2008-08-26T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	you can setup what does the thumbnails using gconf, the default one for most video files is gnome-video-thumbnailer
2008-08-26T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	gconf-editor
2008-08-26T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	how much do you want to do what you want to do?
2008-08-26T17:17:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	for all video files?
2008-08-26T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	you have two options: 1) Find a thumbnailer that lets you specify the frame 2) hack totem-video-thumbnailer (since I don't see a way to specify the frame).  You set the program used to thumbnail for a certain filetype in /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers in gconf
2008-08-26T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	ah, then use what Slart just said in gconf-editor
2008-08-26T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers
2008-08-26T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	yes, and what do you see when you click on one...
2008-08-26T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	yes, so now add the -t option you want
2008-08-26T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	don't know.  One is probably the path to the file
2008-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	paste the command you used
2008-08-26T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	didn't we find out already?
2008-08-26T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	did you ever answer my question about the command you used?
2008-08-26T17:52:00.000Z	ChrisPoland	jrib	what was the question again?
2008-08-26T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	what command are you now using in gconf?
2008-08-26T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	that will work.  Did you delete the old thumbnails so nautilus will rebuild?
2008-08-26T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	then are you sure that the file you are looking at has mime-type video@x-avi?
2008-08-26T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	you don't need to kill nautilus, just do 'rm -r ~/.thumbnails/*' and hit refresh.  To check the mime-type, right click on your file and go to properties
2008-08-26T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	ChrisPoland	what is confusing?
