2012-04-28T22:41:00.000Z	proka		Hi everyone. I have a problem with Amarok on Ubuntu 10.04 - it's process stays active when I quit it from menu or on Ctrl+Q, so to start it again, I have to kill the process and then start it. Also, it doesn't appear in Applications > Sound and video, and I've installed it via the terminal, from the repos. Any ideas on how to fix this? Thank you.
2012-04-28T22:42:00.000Z	holas	proka	try dpkg-reconfigure amarok
2012-04-28T22:43:00.000Z	proka	holas	Nope, that didn't help. :/
2012-04-28T22:44:00.000Z	holas	proka	Did you sudo it right?
2012-04-28T22:46:00.000Z	holas	proka	try sudo aptitude reinstall amarok
2012-04-28T22:47:00.000Z	holas	proka	but before do apt-get purge amarok to remove the left files
2012-04-28T22:47:00.000Z	proka	holas	So, i first purge it, and then reinstall?
2012-04-28T22:47:00.000Z	holas	proka	yes
2012-04-28T22:49:00.000Z	proka	holas	proka@home-pc:~$ amarok
2012-04-28T22:49:00.000Z	holas	proka	ok now install it
2012-04-28T22:50:00.000Z	proka	holas	Done it, same problem...
2012-04-28T22:53:00.000Z	holas	proka	strange, this amarok ;) it's from the universe repo?
2012-04-28T22:54:00.000Z	proka	holas	How can I check that to be sure? I guess it is, but I'm not 100% sure.
2012-04-28T22:55:00.000Z	holas	proka	Your sources.list must be clean
2012-04-28T22:56:00.000Z	holas	proka	I mean Ubuntu-only repos
2012-04-28T22:57:00.000Z	proka	holas	Want me to paste it to pastebin so you can see? I've added the Multisystem, Tor and PyOpenCL repos...
2012-04-28T22:59:00.000Z	holas	proka	then do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get purge amarok && sudo apt-get install amarok
2012-04-28T23:02:00.000Z	proka	holas	Still the same :(
2012-04-28T23:03:00.000Z	holas	proka	then must be a problem with your system
2012-04-28T23:04:00.000Z	proka	holas	Damn... Okay, thanks for your help anyway!
2012-04-28T23:04:00.000Z	holas	proka	I u really wanna try u can download the source and compile
2012-04-28T23:05:00.000Z	proka	holas	I'll probably try that later..
2012-04-28T23:05:00.000Z	holas	proka	that recompiles the deb package
2012-04-28T23:06:00.000Z	holas	proka	Its a prev. step to download it from upstream :)
