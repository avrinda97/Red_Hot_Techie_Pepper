2011-08-22T01:55:00.000Z	etph987		I'm running a server as a main desktop I had a raid running, became annoying and got rid of the majority of hard drives. I took out the raid pci card and now when i boot the server it takes up to 4 minutes to get to the bootloader anyone know a fix?
2011-08-22T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	etph987	why use server as a desktop? Makes no sense
2011-08-22T01:56:00.000Z	etph987	ActionParsnip	only computer right now
2011-08-22T01:56:00.000Z	etph987	ActionParsnip	buying a new laptop soon
2011-08-22T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: I'd ask in #kernel or #linux
2011-08-22T01:57:00.000Z	etph987	ActionParsnip	do i need to uninstall something related to the raid like a driver?
2011-08-22T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	etph987	if yuo run:   lspci    then use the identifying line to find guides
2011-08-22T01:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: it would if there is a proper vdpau module for your system, you have made your own kernel which we cannot support
2011-08-22T02:00:00.000Z	etph987		ActionParsnip:

2011-08-22T02:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: then your kernel is compiled weird then

2011-08-22T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	etph987	1. you only need the ONE line identifying the controller   2. Spamming the channel is not cool
2011-08-22T02:01:00.000Z	etph987		sorry ActionParsnip
2011-08-22T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: none official kernels are not supported here
2011-08-22T02:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: so it is very much a question of your kernel
2011-08-22T02:03:00.000Z	etph987	ActionParsnip	couldn't see anything in the list, might be setup in an old windows partition
2011-08-22T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		pici: can you educate Joer1 on the policy on none official kernels please
2011-08-22T02:04:00.000Z	etph987	ActionParsnip	it just comes up with a blinking underscore for 4 minutes goes blank then comes up with the bootloader
2011-08-22T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		joer1: I think you will find, not
