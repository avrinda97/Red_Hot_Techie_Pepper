2006-11-19T11:07:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	what drive is linux installed on?  Might be trying to boot from the wrong partition
2006-11-19T11:07:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	then set the entry to the right one ;-)
2006-11-19T11:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	boot from a live CD or in another kernel and check the hd() setting for that entry
2006-11-19T11:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	the hd() setting should match your other kernels
2006-11-19T11:10:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	in menu.lst copy the lines from the working kernels
2006-11-19T11:10:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	you said a 26 works, just look at the line for that one
2006-11-19T11:11:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	the difference will be the name of the kernel and initrd, so make those match the 27
2006-11-19T11:21:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	any luck?
2006-11-19T11:21:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	I was wrong before btw, wasabi_ was right
2006-11-19T11:22:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	it's the line for   root   that probably doesn't match
2006-11-19T11:22:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	weird
2006-11-19T11:23:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	did you mess around with your actual kernel or initrd files, also did you boot 27 before the changes?
2006-11-19T11:24:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	I'm not sure what to tell you now, can you paste your menu.lst to the pastebin site?
2006-11-19T11:25:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	boot one of the working kernels and do it
2006-11-19T11:26:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	yeah seeing your file would be helpful for sure
2006-11-19T11:27:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	yes
2006-11-19T11:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	k
2006-11-19T11:40:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	pastebin your changed file
2006-11-19T11:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	;-)
2006-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	somewhat
2006-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	cpl-tnt44	don't just ask me though, ask generally
