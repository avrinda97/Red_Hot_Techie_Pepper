2006-11-12T09:13:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	well yes, i believed the disk editor in the System menu was GParted
2006-11-23T06:34:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	actually i don't think upgrade ever removes anything, that's what dist-upgrade does
2006-11-23T06:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	I know brain fart :)
2006-11-29T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	You should give them more specific info like " update  your firmware " or "change ports" or something.
2006-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	err... try again now perhaps :)
2006-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	Whas that aimed at me?
2006-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	yeah. the guy you were addressing left the channel before you pressed Enter. he's back now, though.
2006-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	If it was I don't know what you mean.
2006-11-30T07:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	Ah, I need to pay more attention / use tab completion :)
2006-11-30T08:57:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	assuming he's root...
2006-11-30T09:00:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	it's st3v3n_r0y
2006-11-30T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	That is what I thought, I am just confused about the nicks, ignore my babble :)
2007-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	MINIMEY_And_DJ_V
2007-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	tanath There are some GUI front ends, can't remember the name of the one I tried ( eventually just used tesseract directly )
2007-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	perhaps, but not in the repositories
2007-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	No, in the repos
2007-10-11T05:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	It could use Ocrad also, it wasn't tesseract specific
2007-10-11T05:42:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	well, "apt-cache search tesseract" only gives tesseract-ocr, and "apt-cache rdepends tesseract-ocr" doesn't give anything, so i wouldn't know where to look
2007-10-11T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	Yeah, it didn't depend on it, just offered to use it if it was there
2007-10-11T05:43:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	uhm, then it should at least recommend or suggest it...
2007-12-03T06:29:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	nice, script is linux-only i suppose? (don't have synaptic)
2009-03-08T02:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LjL	I think that in intrepid it actually might ( I know there were plans to make nm /e/n/interfaces aware but I don't know if they made it into intrepid )
2009-03-08T02:16:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	not sure
2010-07-11T02:09:00.000Z	LjL	Jordan_U	i still do, fwiw ;)
