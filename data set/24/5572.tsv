2010-11-10T01:47:00.000Z	gogeta	jrib	yes but in runlevel 1 you boot into a root bash
2010-11-10T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	gogeta	are you sure init 1 won't prompt for the root password?
2010-11-10T01:54:00.000Z	gogeta	jrib	nope it invokes single user
2010-11-10T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	gogeta	single /does/ ask for the root password if it is set
2010-11-10T01:54:00.000Z	gogeta	jrib	never did me
2010-11-10T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	gogeta	because you don't have a root password set

2010-11-10T02:00:00.000Z	gogeta	jrib	brings up a curses menu with drop to root shell as a option
2010-11-10T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	gogeta	right, if you have a root password set you won't be able to drop to a root shell without knowing.  This was dax2112rush's issue
