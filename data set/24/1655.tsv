2009-11-20T10:44:00.000Z	datz		Hi, I have just manually added a user through command, but when I try to run a script, there is not adequate permission to write to a file. How can I add this?
2009-11-20T10:45:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	you are trying to write where and with the new user you are trying ?
2009-11-20T10:45:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	yes with new use, and pid file
2009-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	where is the file
2009-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	the file is in a home dir
2009-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	the new users home dir?
2009-11-20T10:47:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	I didn't create a dir for the new user
2009-11-20T10:47:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	so user2 is trying to write to user1's home dir?
2009-11-20T10:48:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	yes
2009-11-20T10:49:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	users are normally not given permissions to write to other users home directories
2009-11-20T10:50:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	easiest thing would be to add home dir for new user?
2009-11-20T10:56:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	I have the same problem when I create a home dir for the new user
2009-11-20T10:56:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	I think I need to edit the permissions of the user, is there any tutorial for this?
2009-11-20T11:02:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	any other suggestions?
2009-11-20T11:02:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	you can use sudo to write to any folder, but be careful
2009-11-20T11:03:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	new user not in sudoers file
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	do you want him to be?
2009-11-20T11:04:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	well I just want to be able to run this app as another user
2009-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	why do you need to access another users home directory to do that?
2009-11-20T11:05:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	if that's what it takes, then yes
2009-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	wont boot
2009-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	datz	Billiard	but will install?
2009-12-26T11:32:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	the live cd wont
2009-12-26T11:33:00.000Z	Billiard	datz	the x64 live cd wont boot on a non 64bit system
