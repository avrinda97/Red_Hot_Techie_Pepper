2006-02-23T14:09:00.000Z	zebraFusion		Can someone tell me why I'm getting that error when running ettercap -G
2006-02-23T14:01:00.000Z	zebraFusion		What's the best way to transfer files between systems?
2006-02-23T14:01:00.000Z	zebraFusion		On the network
2006-02-23T14:01:00.000Z	zebraFusion		Both running Ubuntu
2006-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	best for what? easiness? sftp, you can install openssh-server if you want remote login, or install vsftpd if you want just file transfer. Then use Places>Connect to Server to connect, it iwll open a nautilus window with your files for you.
2006-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	What commands would I use if I already have an sshserver on one of them?
2006-02-23T14:04:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	Just use the gnome menu on the top of your screen. Places>Connect to Server>SSH, it mounts it as a network drive.
2006-02-23T14:05:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	GUIs are nice but I'd like to learn how to do it in terminal, do you have any guides or antyhign i could read?
2006-02-23T14:06:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	"man sftp", "username@sftp ip.of.other.comp", put, get.
2006-02-23T14:06:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	if you want to learn something really useful^
2006-02-23T14:06:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	that has no aplication in a 2 computer network, though:)
2006-02-23T14:06:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	I do :] 
2006-02-23T14:07:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	good, then you can tell me all about it, and provide tech support for me when you learn about nfs.
2006-02-23T14:07:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	I'm trying to learn amerature systems administration... I already have my ssh server and apache running, also, a vnc server in case I can't cut it in ssh.
2006-02-23T14:49:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	mount it, then copy files over
2006-02-23T14:50:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	it's moutned, but it looks like it's protected.
2006-02-23T14:50:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	(It has a lock on the folder) :x
2006-02-23T14:51:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	I can copy files but they have the lock on the icon... I'm not sure what that means
2006-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	means you can not write to the disk.
2006-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	so if I'm just copying files does that matter?
2006-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	if it works, do not fix it.
2006-02-23T14:54:00.000Z	zebraFusion	dabaR	I'm just woried that after I copy the files there will be some error.
2006-02-23T14:56:00.000Z	dabaR	zebraFusion	it should be fine, how is it?
