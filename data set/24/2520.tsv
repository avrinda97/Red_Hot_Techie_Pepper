2009-02-21T06:32:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	hlm - looks like you need to add some repository for nonfree stuff
2009-05-05T03:26:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	that sounds bad. Did it say something like "i repair this and that" a million times?
2009-05-05T03:26:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	I'm running it from gparted
2009-05-05T03:27:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	hmm. I would wipe the drive and do a fresh format, then a surface scan.
2009-05-05T03:27:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	24hrs is too long
2009-05-05T03:28:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	It has all of my backups on it - ones that I need to restore, I'm getting a "stale NFS file handle (116)" error when I try to copy data
2009-05-05T03:29:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	thats beyon my knowledge... you could try EasyRecovery, the demo is fully funcional for some days and *might* be able to read from your linux partition, too.
2009-05-05T03:29:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	google that error message
2009-05-05T03:29:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	alright, I'll give that a shot.  thanks.  Also, I did google it, it said to fsck on it.
2009-05-05T03:32:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	this is my dmesg, notice the problems at the bottom: http://pastebin.com/d10511920
2009-05-05T03:33:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	Buffer I/O Error most often is a very bad sign. Your drive might already be lost, but lets hope, that you get your data.
2009-05-05T03:34:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	I'll grab EasyRecovery and see what that does.  Thanks.
2009-05-05T03:34:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	Buffer I/O errors point to damaged drive electronics
2009-05-05T03:35:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	yes.  excellent.
2009-05-05T03:38:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	I'ma give ddrescue a shot and see what I can do with that
2009-05-05T03:39:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	keep me posted on the results. Good luck!
2009-05-05T03:53:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	wait, this is going to make a 500gb iso img, isn't it.
2009-05-05T03:53:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	uhm. yes.
2009-05-05T03:54:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	crap.  I don't have the space on my laptop for that.
2009-05-05T05:33:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	well, photorec recovered them all, just didn't save them into their directories
2009-05-05T05:34:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	so I don't know...if that was even useful.
2010-04-18T03:50:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	things that need to be freed is handled by the kernel
2010-04-18T03:51:00.000Z	hmw	h00k	you saying, i only can reboot?
2010-04-18T03:51:00.000Z	h00k	hmw	basically
