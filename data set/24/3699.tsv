2008-01-25T05:24:00.000Z	bkar		ThipThip-> file system type, ntfs-3g isnt it?
2008-01-25T05:25:00.000Z	bkar		Corndawg_-> the -v on grep selects the opposite thats why you dont need the []
2008-01-25T05:26:00.000Z	bkar		ThipThip-> thats what you type as option to mount  -t ntfs-3g
2008-01-25T05:28:00.000Z	bkar		Corndawg_-> play around with grep, pipe it a second time if necessary to filter what you need if cant be done in one swoop
2008-01-25T05:30:00.000Z	bkar		ThipThip-> okay lets try,  do a  sudo fdisk -l  and pastebin the results
2008-01-25T05:31:00.000Z	bkar		geekchicohio-> sometimes these cable modems locks your mac address it detects at install or at boot, so turn the cable modem off, wait a 1 minute then turn it back on,
2008-01-25T05:32:00.000Z	bkar		ThipThip-> sdb1 you are after?
2008-01-25T05:32:00.000Z	bkar		Corndawg_-> sometimes an extra step is all it takes, :)
2008-01-25T05:33:00.000Z	bkar		ThipThip-> sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt   see if it mounts
2008-01-25T05:34:00.000Z	bkar		ffm-> sounds uses /dev/dsp
2008-01-25T05:34:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	I know.
2008-01-25T05:35:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	and it is bussy
2008-01-25T05:36:00.000Z	bkar	ffm	lsof -d /dev/dsp   you may have to man lsof  to see the correct option for device
2008-01-25T05:37:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	command has no output
2008-01-25T05:38:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	command has no output
2008-01-25T05:38:00.000Z	bkar	ffm	i dont know what is the correct options for checking the device..can you man lsof ?
2008-01-25T05:38:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	yes, bu tI ha ve  never used lsof before
2008-01-25T05:39:00.000Z	bkar	ffm	well sometimes we dont use some tools that are available thats why we use man pages
2008-01-25T05:40:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	yes, but searching through the man page with / does not seem to have a "this switch for block devices" bit.
2008-01-25T05:40:00.000Z	bkar	ffm	you have to do some leg work, i cant remember all the verbage on that man page
2008-01-25T05:43:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	oh well then.
2008-01-25T05:44:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	is there any other sound adapter I can use?
2008-01-25T05:44:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	is there any other sound device I can use?
2008-01-25T05:48:00.000Z	ffm	bkar	any other /dev I can use other than dsp for sound?
