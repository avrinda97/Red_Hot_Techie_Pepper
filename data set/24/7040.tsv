2006-07-28T14:32:00.000Z	rixth		How can I capture the output of ffmpeg to a file? ffmpeg > log does not work, nor does ffmpeg >> log
2006-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	the output of ffmpeg?
2006-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	yeah, the text that it outputs about the conversion process.
2006-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	be specific, what your full command is, what you are trying to do, etc
2006-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	try ffmpeg 2&1> out.txt
2006-07-28T14:34:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	ehh sorry the & should go just before the >
2006-07-28T14:35:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	add 21&> out.txt
2006-07-28T14:35:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	and #bash would be more helpful for your kind of question
2006-07-28T14:35:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	that does make it go to the logfile, but the very last line of the log is "Unable for find a suitable output format for '21'" which is a ffmpeg error
2006-07-28T14:36:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	"ffmpeg -i /home/rixth/file.mpg -acodec mp3 -ar 22050 -ab 32 -f flv -s 320x240 -y /tmp/converter.mpg" 21&> out
2006-07-28T14:36:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	mind the quotes, and check #bash
2006-07-28T14:37:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	when I check the log is says "bash: ffmpeg -i /home/rixth/file.mpg -acodec mp3 -ar 22050 -ab 32 -f flv -s 320x240 -y ~/converter.mpg: No such file or directory" going to bash now...
2006-07-28T14:48:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	it cant find a library
2006-07-28T14:48:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	I know that much =) But why would only one user her it?
2006-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	because he or she (yes...) might not have the right library path set
2006-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	how can I set the paths?
2006-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	i.e that library might be in /usr/local and that might not be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, an environemntal variable
2006-07-28T14:51:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	anywyays, I hope my answer helped
2006-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	instal gnome support
2006-08-12T08:23:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	my fonts are still not available.
2006-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	#openoffice ?, try irc.gnome.org
2006-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	I know about that. Non-free formats (mov, wmv etc) play fine. But the free ones do not.
2006-08-12T08:29:00.000Z	sanmarcos	rixth	read what I sent you
2006-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	rixth	sanmarcos	I have ben to that page multiple times.
