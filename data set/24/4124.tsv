2007-09-28T09:49:00.000Z	Nyle		irssi is more powerful than any of those clients imo
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	Nyle		nothing else really cuts it, and it is extremely configurable
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	Nyle		what is the release date?
2007-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	Nyle		will kubuntu gusty release on the same date as ubuntu gusty
2007-09-28T09:51:00.000Z	Nyle		kdve vs gnome
2007-09-28T09:51:00.000Z	Nyle		i like kde because gnome doesn't have what i want
2007-09-28T09:52:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	 For instance ?
2007-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	and well, gnome doesn't have the left/right click functionality
2007-09-28T09:53:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	sure it does, and you can configure gnome just about anyway you'd like
2007-09-28T09:54:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	how, please tell me
2007-09-28T09:54:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	 how what?
2007-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	 kde out of the box doesnt bring up kcontrol or system settings with right click either
2007-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	don't worry about it
2007-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	of course i configured it myself
2007-09-28T09:58:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	no thanks.  I'll stick to Qt
2007-09-28T09:58:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	imo Qt is superior to gtk2 in the respect that it allowes coloring.  Gtk2 themes are static, and colors cannot be changed on the fly like in kde/qt
2007-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	again you are incorrect
2007-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	maybe they made it better now?
2007-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	so what am I wrong about?
2007-09-28T09:59:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	I think you need to dedicate yourself one month to exclusively use gnome, and nothing else, then research how to do things before stating inaccurate facts :)
2007-09-28T10:02:00.000Z	kkathman	Nyle	 I am not arguing that you like Qt over gtk2 = opinion.... but saying you "cant" do something, when in fact you can, isnt opinion.
2007-09-28T10:02:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	then please tell me how I can, because I already told you I can't find those options
2007-09-28T10:02:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	in fact, even someone else somewhat confirmed that what I want is not possible in gnome
2007-09-28T10:18:00.000Z	Nyle	kkathman	no thanks
