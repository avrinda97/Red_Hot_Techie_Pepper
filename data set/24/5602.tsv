2006-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	are you on dapper?
2006-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Yes.
2006-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	then all the kernels are SMP
2006-06-06T15:36:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Oh, wow. Really?
2006-06-06T15:36:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	yeah, as of dapper all kernels are SMP, because there's no performance hit on non SMP procs
2006-06-06T15:36:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Cuz I know I didn't have any hyperthreading junk back in Warty, and I have absolutely no boost in performance now that I'm in dapper and using kernel 686.
2006-06-06T15:37:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	So I think I'm going about enabling hyperthreading incorrectly... :/
2006-06-06T15:37:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	A security update for Ubuntu said that they were disabling ht by default, and that I have to run some sort of parameter to enable ht again, and I'm pretty n00bish still...
2006-06-06T15:38:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	oh, where'd you read that?
2006-06-06T15:39:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Er... lemme find a URL for you.
2006-06-06T15:39:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	I mean, there's the news story: http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/13/HNintelexpose_1.html?source=rss&url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/13/HNintelexpose_1.html
2006-06-06T15:40:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	right, but where did you read about them disabling by default?
2006-06-06T15:41:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Lemme do the digging through Google that I did last night...
2006-06-06T15:42:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Ohhhh, haha, I happened to not notice the "this vulnerability affects Warty and Hoary."
2006-06-06T15:42:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Alright, fine. Well poo.
2006-06-06T15:43:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	right, SMP is already enabled in the kernel, so if your proc supports it, it's working.
2006-06-06T15:43:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	It was late and I didn't have my coffee. But anyway, I still suspect that I for some reason don't have hyperthreading, because my CPU monitor is telling me that it's constantly being used at 50%.
2006-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	That and everything in Ubuntu is far slower for me than in WinXP.
2006-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Is there at least any way I can check to see if I have hyperthreading enabled? That would pretty much solve it for me...
2006-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	well, there is a method to figure out how many procs you 'have
2006-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	'have' but, I don't recall the command
2006-06-06T15:45:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	...is there any chance you could remember it easily, or should I go hunting for it online?
2006-06-06T15:45:00.000Z	Flannel	cvp	Me? no.  someone here might though.
2006-06-06T15:46:00.000Z	cvp	Flannel	Thanks for all your help, by the way. :)
