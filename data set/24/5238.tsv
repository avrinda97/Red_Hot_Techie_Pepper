2008-09-12T22:52:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	thank you.
2008-09-12T22:53:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	"MPEG ADTS, layer II, v1, 160 kBits, 48 kHz, Stereo" is what I get. What file is it? How can I convert it to MP3?
2008-09-12T22:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	it seems like it already is ... not layer III but layer II
2008-09-12T22:54:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	My iPod can't play it. Can be converted to an mp3 compatible with an iPod?
2008-09-12T22:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	try with ffmpeg ... ffmpeg -i file_name_of_extracted_track whatever.mp3
2008-09-12T22:55:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	thank you so much! I'll try that right away.
2008-09-12T22:57:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	I get an error: Unable to find suitable output format.
2008-09-12T22:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	:| try opening it on audacious and exporting it as mp3 ??
2008-09-12T22:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	or with sox?
2008-09-12T22:58:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	thanks.
2010-01-18T05:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	rerun the command redirecting output to a file ?
2010-01-18T05:03:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	It's a very CPU intensive process, so is there a way not to have to re-run the command?
2010-01-18T05:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	use a mouse to copy and paste ? GNU screen has a copy mode but plain terminal emulators do not have it afaik
2010-07-17T21:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	i do not know of any good way ....
2010-07-17T21:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	turns out you can use a third party reg editor via wine http://thelinuxgirl.blogspot.com/2009/01/editing-windows-registry-through-linux.html
2010-07-17T21:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	live and see
2010-07-17T21:37:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	thanks, but that requires installing wine, and I'm not very familiar with that software. However, I did find a package called "registry-tools" in the depositories that I think might work.
2010-07-17T21:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	sudo aptitude install wine1.2 ; when is done download the installer of one of those tools double click on it and click on next till done
2011-02-06T00:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	Vbox
2011-02-06T00:42:00.000Z	StevenX	erUSUL	which would be more lightweight. Running wubi or running a virtual box?
2011-02-06T00:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	with wubi you can not run them side by side; you have to dual boot
2011-02-06T00:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	i dunno if that's ok or not
2011-02-28T00:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	StevenX	sudo umount -a; only umounts things listed in fstab
