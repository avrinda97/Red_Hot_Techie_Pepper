2005-06-20T14:25:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	look at debfoster
2005-06-20T14:25:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	if you install things using aptitude, all dependencies will be removed when uninstalling
2005-06-20T14:26:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	I use the synaptic manager
2005-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	maybe synaptic does it too, i don't know it :)
2005-06-20T14:28:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	synaptic has two remove options, mark for removal, and mark for complete removal... could it be the later?
2005-06-20T14:31:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	no
2005-06-20T14:59:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	install openssh-server
2005-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	openssh-server is sshd..
2005-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	dns server settings are managed by dhclient, and that can screw up things for you
2005-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	as root, edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2005-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	nothing in there that I can do... I'll check resolv.conf
2005-06-29T12:03:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	set the ouypuy plugin of XMMS to esound :)
2005-06-29T12:11:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	damn you! worked like MAGIC !! w00t!

2005-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	fam is obsolete
2005-08-21T14:21:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	thanks a lot. I'm writing a program, so do you think many distros are using gamin ?
2005-08-21T14:21:00.000Z	Seveas	glDaher	afaik the API is the same
2005-08-21T14:23:00.000Z	glDaher	Seveas	thanks ... you're right... quote: "Basically it is exactly like for using the fam interface. From a programmer point of view this is the same API."
