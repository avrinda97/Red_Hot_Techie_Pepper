2010-05-19T01:15:00.000Z	lordship		running 8.04 now. Is there an advantage to running 9.10. If so, how do I upgrade?
2010-05-19T01:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	yes and no
2010-05-19T01:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	you can directly upgrade to 10.04, but not 9.10
2010-05-19T01:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	also you won't get Ext4 file system or Grub 2 on upgrade, but you don't need those
2010-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	8.04 is better than 10.04 in certain ways, it really is
2010-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	lordship		sebsebseb:ok up to 10.04, is there an easy pathway? I'm new to ubuntu
2010-05-19T01:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	how new?
2010-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	lordship		like 4 months
2010-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	ok if your that new, why  did you start on 8.04?
2010-05-19T01:17:00.000Z	lordship	sebsebseb	that's what downloaded of the cd I have.
2010-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	ok, but four months ago,  the Ubuntu website would give the option.  to download 8.04 or 9.10
2010-05-19T01:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	most new users would have gone with 9.10, however nevermind,  it's ok that you went with 8.04,  since as a result you have been using one of the best versions of Ubuntu,  and no 9.10 isn't one of those.
2010-05-19T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	why do you want to upgrade now?  Newer is not always better.
2010-05-19T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	and 8.04 runs out of support end of April next year on the desktop no more security updates.  and  10.10 comes out on October 10th 2010,  I have a feeling that will be a pretty good release
2010-05-19T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	from what I know about it
2010-05-19T01:21:00.000Z	lordship	sebsebseb	thanks. I guess my issue is that i'm using gedit to write html code, and it won't allow any font face changes. size, yeah, but sometimes size doesn't matter.
2010-05-19T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	might be a good idea to first try 10.04 in a virtual machine, if your computer can handle that so enough RAM for example, then decide if your going to upgrade to 10.04 or not.
2010-05-19T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	loads of programs you can  use instead  for HTML code in Ubuntu
2010-05-19T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!html | lordship
2010-05-19T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!gedit | lordship
2010-05-19T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	plus loads of programs that you can code HTML in on Windows, will work well in Wine
2010-05-19T01:26:00.000Z	lordship		sebsebseb/ubottu: thanks, I'll go play for a while and see what works.
2010-05-19T01:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!thanks | lordship
2010-05-19T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lordship	you don't need to thank the bot, she is a computer program not a person
