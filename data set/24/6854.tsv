2005-10-20T13:52:00.000Z	jessid		hi some of you know how can i fix this: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz: El subproceso gzip devolvi un cdigo de error (1)
2005-10-20T13:52:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	run your apt-get again
2005-10-20T13:54:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	with which parameter?
2005-10-20T13:55:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	the same way you ran it before
2005-10-20T13:56:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	the servers are under a heavy load, and you may not have d/l a complete file
2005-10-20T13:56:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	I use synaptic. I think I have problems with my sources.list. I dont know which are the correct repositories
2005-10-20T13:57:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	i doubt its your sources, this is a common problem when a file doesnt download properly
2005-10-20T13:58:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	so I have to run apt-get update???
2005-10-20T13:58:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	yes try that
2005-10-25T10:56:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	in your .bashrc
2005-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	and if I, for example, want to run some app that uses java, is it going to work editing that file?? I mean if I do ALT+F2 and I write javac after I have edited, the command is not recognized
2005-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	you'll have to "source /home/username/.bashrc" after you edit it
2005-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	ok
2005-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	thanks!
2005-10-25T11:05:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	but how can I for example make my $PATH to aid to another directories? I mean I have already source .bashrc and I cant yet do ALT+F2 and get java recognized :(
2005-10-25T11:06:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	put java in your $PATH
2005-10-25T11:07:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	offcourse i have edited the .bashrc and wrote export $PATH:/opt/j2sdk1.5/bin and napa, nothing happens when I try to run that command (java) from application launcher (ALT+F2). Sorry for my ignorance
2005-10-30T10:43:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	yes it is
2005-10-30T10:46:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	yes it is possible if the machine you want to log into has a ssh server running and you have an account on it
2005-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	text based...in a console
2005-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	yes, see my original answer
2005-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	so the command is ssh?
2005-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	nalioth	jessid	see the debian new maintainers guide at debian.org
2005-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	jessid	nalioth	ok ok. thanks
