2009-05-04T04:41:00.000Z	Roasted		Not to be an idiot, but I have a question - is banshee a gnome-native program?
2009-05-04T04:42:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	I believe it is
2009-10-31T07:18:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	not between releases, no.  The exception is the LTS releases (there are Live CDs for 8.04, 8.04.1 and 8.04.2)
2009-10-31T07:19:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- oh man... that's a big problem then...
2009-10-31T07:20:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	why, what's your actual problem?
2009-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- I have 4 drives in my system. When I boot to 9.04 and manually edit the partitions, I see all 4 drives. In 9.10, I don't. It's very strange. I installed 9.10 and decided to try and addt hem to fstab but that was a disaster - fstab has an issue to be worked out in 9.10 it seems (several other users confirmed the same problem).
2009-10-31T07:21:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- fstab issues can be fixed with a patch later. Okay fine. But what about the live cd? I'd like to be able to not only DETECT my drives but also mount them to the corresponding directories. 9.10 didn't even pick up my 2 250gb drives, and theyre just normal SATA drives.
2009-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	sudo fdisk -l   <-- that doesn't show them?
2009-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- it sure does. That's why I'm so confused...
2009-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- I have to do more testing later. Currently Im back on 9.04 and getting my drives to ext4 file systems. But it was very weird....
2009-10-31T07:22:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- thats what I get for installing an OS that (at the time) was 2 hours old :P
2009-10-31T07:23:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	It *should* have worked :p  Use a more stable distro if you don't like this sort of thing (Debian)
2009-10-31T07:24:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- why would I want to do something foolish like that? :P
2009-10-31T07:24:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- nothing against debian, but I've tried like 30 different distros and ended up back on Ubuntu each time. Its solid, stable, easy to use, etc. Its just what I get for installing a distro version that was so young.
2009-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- Im sure when debian pumps out a new version theyre not 100% problem proof :P
2009-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	ok, cool, whatever works best for you.  Debian stable is *very* stable though (after all, that is the point)
2009-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	but that's off-topic isn't it
2009-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- we dont wanna get yelled at for being off topic when talking about linux in a linux chat. (I know how that goes in here)
2009-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	I was OT talking about debian.  Now, where were we with your ubuntu trouble?
2009-10-31T07:28:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- not sure if theres anything that can be trouble-shot now. I'm on 9.04. Figured Id give 9.10 a few weeks before I try it again.
2009-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	it's the disks not being recognised is it?  That's happened to me in the past when I've changed kernels.  You could try to upgrade from jaunty to karmic directly later on, when it's (hopefully) fixed -- no need for a Cd
2009-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- it wouldnt be a problem if I could edit Fstab to mount my drives by UUID. But karmic was just acting very very weird. Having other users confirm the same thing just made me think I jumped the gun too soon. So I'm sticking with 9.04 for a few weeks till I hear 9.10 settles down, at least in the fstab department. Other than that I hear great things about it.
2009-10-31T07:33:00.000Z	jken146	Roasted	ok, fair enough.  I suppose you've tried editing fstab from a live CD
2009-10-31T07:36:00.000Z	Roasted	jken146	- I have not tried that. I just decided to bag that idea cause my computer also acts as a file server, so I kinda need it running, and to have fstab giving me a headache when that same fstab (I have it backed up) works on every other known version of ubuntu to man, well....
