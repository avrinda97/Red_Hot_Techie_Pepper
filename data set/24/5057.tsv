2008-07-09T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	what is the output of "alsaconf list" ?
2008-07-09T11:07:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	"alsaconf" command not found
2008-07-09T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	sorry, "asoundconf list"
2008-07-09T11:09:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	it says it found 1, "CA0106"
2008-07-09T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	OK, now try "asoundconf set-default-card CA0106"
2008-07-09T11:10:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	mist@mist-desktop:~$ asoundconf set-default-card CA0106
2008-07-09T11:11:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	 I was 1/2 step ahead of you ;-)
2008-07-09T11:16:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	thank you very much! I've used Ubuntu on and off for years (since the release of Dapper), I just forget some bash commands like asoundconfig, lspci, etc
2008-07-09T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	And listen to them too :)
2008-07-09T11:18:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	I have all the packages I believe are necessary, but I still get errors on ./configure
2008-07-09T11:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	You need to cd into the directory you created when you decompressed whatever you downoladed
2008-07-09T11:24:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	that was the decompressed dir
2008-07-09T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	Can you give me a link to what you downloaded?
2008-07-09T11:28:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	I typed the "cd.../RO" earlier, just to shorten it because I couldn't remember the name of the file. I was in the right one, or else change dir (cd) wouldn't have worked.
2008-07-09T11:29:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	I have since deleted the file, but would using tilda (~./configure) change much?
2008-07-09T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	No
2008-07-09T11:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	That would look for a .configure script in your home folder
2008-07-09T11:30:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	i know my way around ubuntu, but there are still some linux/unix basics I don't understand.
2008-07-09T11:30:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	i'd like to learn as much as I can, do you think a linux+ course would be good?
2008-07-09T11:31:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/RPG/Ragnarok-Online-Client-21810.shtml
2008-07-09T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	I don't know about linux+ specifically but taking a Unix / Linux coarse is a good way to learn
2008-07-09T11:33:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	it's just the basics I'd like to get more into. I self-studied a+ course, it's all down to syntax, really....
2008-07-09T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mistform	From the download page "working... some kinda", doesn't sound to assuring :)
2008-07-09T11:35:00.000Z	mistform	Jordan_U	I was never able to make/make build. so I didn't get to the effectiveness part....
