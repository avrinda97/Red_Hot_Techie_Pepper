2008-09-09T01:05:00.000Z	krauss		Does anyone know if the resolution of Ubuntu is resizable?
2008-09-09T01:06:00.000Z	krauss		It's kind of hard on my eyes.
2008-09-09T01:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	What are you wanting to do, change the resolution?
2008-09-09T01:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	So what are your options in System->Preferences->Screen Resolution?
2008-09-09T01:09:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	:)
2008-09-09T01:11:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Has it crashed abruptly like that before?
2008-09-09T01:12:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	What version of flash are you using?
2008-09-09T01:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	I always like to be sure of the flash version. So, would you mind checking about:plugins in Firefox, please?
2008-09-09T01:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Do you have libflashsupport installed? I find for some people that disabling compiz (Visual Effects set to None) helps.
2008-09-09T01:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects, set to None.
2008-09-09T01:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Is there a reason you're using such an old version?
2008-09-09T01:30:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	It's all I could get my hands on. I'm just a 15 year old
2008-09-09T01:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Well, that shouldn't mean anything ;) Do you have high speed internet and a disc burner?
2008-09-09T01:32:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	I sure do
2008-09-09T01:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Then I would suggest downloading the LiveCD iso for Hardy and making your own Hardy disc.
2008-09-09T01:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	It's not so bad, but I WOULD suggest starting from scratch.
2008-09-09T01:40:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	Not to get off topic, but if you're concerned about your age, let me just tell you that I ran across an eight-year-old here one day who did a Wubi installation of Hardy!
2008-09-09T01:41:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	Wow...........
2008-09-09T01:42:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	And The Bahamas is not that advanced in technology anyways.
2008-09-09T01:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	but that's exactly the type of environment where the open-source movement thrives the most :D
2008-09-09T01:44:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	 I guess that's why I'm here, huh? ;)
2008-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	You said an 8 year old installed a WUBI version of Linux
2008-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	krauss	bobertdos	What's that?
2008-09-09T04:56:00.000Z	bobertdos	krauss	good
