2008-01-03T00:44:00.000Z	sluimers		Hello, 1) How do I change an empty fat32 external HDD to an ntfs? 2) It just fell off the coffee table, 40 cm's high, is that enough to destroy the external HDD? I can't find it anymore, lsusb shows nothing.

2008-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	nooooooooooo :(
2008-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	I just got it.
2008-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	your system does not recognize him anymore
2008-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	yah
2008-01-03T00:46:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	on reboot does your bios see the HD ?
2008-01-03T00:46:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	haven't tried it yet
2008-01-03T00:47:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	will do
2008-01-03T00:55:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	still nothing
2008-01-03T00:56:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	humm so nothing on BIOS ?
2008-01-03T00:56:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	nope :(
2008-01-03T00:57:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	that means the external HD is dead, no?
2008-01-03T00:57:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	Does you disk make any sound when you power up the pc ?
2008-01-03T00:57:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	a light buzzing sound
2008-01-03T00:58:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	no clicking ?
2008-01-03T00:59:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	no, no clicking
2008-01-03T00:59:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	just burrrrrrrrrrrr.... ur... burrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2008-01-03T00:59:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	i would personnally test it on another machine to confirm that he is in fact dead
2008-01-03T00:59:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	not the good kind imo though
2008-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	did that, no response
2008-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	from what you telling then i would confirm the HD dead
2008-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	sluimers	tribaldata	I just can't believe I haven't even used it yet and now it's dead
2008-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	tribaldata	sluimers	then you should have warranty
