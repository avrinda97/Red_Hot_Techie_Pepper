2007-02-07T15:25:00.000Z	indigoparrot		hey all, can anyone help me.  There's a bug in Kopete to do with webcams, and i've found a bug fix, i'm just not sure how to compile it.
2007-02-07T15:26:00.000Z	indigoparrot		can anyone help me with compiling Kopete, or should i try in a KDE channel?
2007-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	why would you like to do that??
2007-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	just install the package
2007-02-07T15:27:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	i can't, i need to edit the source, then compile
2007-02-07T15:28:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	then it should be easy, just make sure you have kde*-dev packages installed
2007-02-07T15:28:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	better yet, download ubuntu's kopete source package and modify
2007-02-07T15:29:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	what package name would i be looking for? Kopete-sources?
2007-02-07T15:29:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	apt-get source kopete AFAIR
2007-02-07T15:34:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	now i've run the apt-get, where do i find the source packages?
2007-02-07T15:34:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	in the current dir
2007-02-07T15:35:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	then after modifying the src compile the new package
2007-02-07T15:37:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	ok, assume i'm some kind of useless ape, what commands do i need to run to compile it now?
2007-02-07T15:38:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	i don't remember, read the manual, man apt-get
2007-02-07T15:44:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	so, have you found the command?
2007-02-07T15:44:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	i have run configure
2007-02-07T15:44:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	don't! compile the package not the source
2007-02-07T15:45:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	wait
2007-02-07T15:46:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	run "sudo dpkg-buildpackage" in the src directory
2007-02-07T15:47:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	that's the right way to recompile the package after modification
2007-02-07T15:47:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	does it work? i'm talking out of memory
2007-02-07T15:50:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	do you run as root, sudo?
2007-02-07T15:51:00.000Z	Echoes	indigoparrot	, you must be in the package directory
2007-02-07T15:55:00.000Z	indigoparrot	Echoes	"cdbs docbook-to-man kdelibs4-dev (>= 4:3.5.0) libgadu-dev libslp-dev automake1.9 libglib2.0-dev" - those were the unmet build dependencies
