2011-02-26T06:27:00.000Z	Cataclysm		hi!! is there anyway to remove the automessage when i login after starting the chat program in ubuntu
2011-02-26T06:27:00.000Z	Cataclysm		its quite annoying
2011-02-26T06:27:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	The top-right bubble or the IRC message?
2011-02-26T06:29:00.000Z	Cataclysm	Starminn	the top right bubble, or both :)
2011-02-26T06:32:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	The top-right bubble is controlled by something called (I think) indicator-messages which you can remove if you want but that would kill *all* messages. ;) As far as going for specific ones I don't know. If you're asking abotu the IRC window, that is something to be discussed wherever that program's discussions take pleace.
2011-02-26T06:33:00.000Z	Cataclysm	Starminn	that solution is terrible :(
2011-02-26T06:34:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	There was an app that you could force indicator messages to appear, but I don't know about disappear. I'll look into it now.
2011-02-26T06:34:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	That's what we do here! If we don't know we Google it sense we usually know the good places to look. ;)
2011-02-26T06:36:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	This shows how to blacklist an individual program.. http://lifehacker.com/#!5703681/remove-unwanted-entries-from-ubuntus-messaging-menu
2011-02-26T06:38:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Hmm... Actually I don't think that's what we're looking for. That's for the mail icon it looks like.
2011-02-26T06:39:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Alright, well it looks like if the option did exist, it would be in the application itself, not-so-much in some config file for indicator-messages somewhere.
2011-02-26T06:39:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	I would suggest asking people who know about your app. For example, Pidgin is #pidgin and I would assume Empathy would be #empathy
2011-02-26T06:40:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Other than that it's always an all-or-nothing answer to people with similar questions. Sorry.
2011-02-26T06:41:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Ubuntu default = Empathy. And alright, happy hunting!
2011-02-26T06:43:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	I use (and love) Pidgin.
2011-02-26T06:45:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	:) Try 'em all out though and see what you like. My preference is Pidgin, but there are many others out there. To each their own.
2011-02-26T06:46:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Digsby has no Linux support
2011-02-26T06:46:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	I used Digsby on WIndows and actually installed Pidgin on it two days ago so I had some consistency. If you go to the Digsby site they say Mac/inux support is coming soon but I've yet to see anything come of it.
2011-02-26T06:47:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	It *does* run in WINE though, might I add. I use it to send SMS messages since Pidgin is slow at it but Pidgin is much better than Digsby+WINE for daily use
2011-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Go to Ubuntu Software Center and go to Games.
2011-02-26T06:50:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	Being an Atari fan I have Frogger and Circus Linux!, and being a Jezzball fan from Windows I have KBounce. There's also SuperTux2 which is Super Mario-esque and
2011-02-26T06:51:00.000Z	Cataclysm	Starminn	so should i remove empathy after i installed pidgin
2011-02-26T06:52:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	If you want. Empathy is there by default though (as "Chat") on bootup, but Pidgin gets added whenever you start it.
2011-02-26T06:52:00.000Z	Starminn	Cataclysm	You don't have to remove Empathy and Pidgin will integrate by default after you start it the first time per boot, yes.
