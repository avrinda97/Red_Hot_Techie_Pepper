2006-06-08T06:10:00.000Z	paolo_		Hi guys! Yesterday my edubuntu server freezed, and now I see that the syslog shows: "Jun  7 09:12:17 server-basica gnome-power-manager: Hibernating computer because the DBUS method Hibernate() was invoked". What does it mean? thank you!
2006-06-08T06:11:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	remove gnome-power-manager from that installation ...
2006-06-08T06:12:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	when I try to run gnome-power-manager a window is shown saying: "This program cannot start until you start the dbus session service."  That's strange, because ps shows me that dbus is running...
2006-06-08T06:12:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	likely only the system dbus ...
2006-06-08T06:13:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	in any case you should remove gnome-power-manager (if thats an edubuntu ltsp server)
2006-06-08T06:13:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	"ps axu|grep dbus|grep paolo    paolo     4991  0.0  0.0   2712   636 ?        S    07:57   0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session x-session-manager"
2006-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	ok, I'm going to remove it
2006-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	else users will be able to force hibernation of the server
2006-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	do you get this dbus error from a thin client or on the server
2006-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	you mean that yesterday the server hibernated because some client asked it?
2006-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	from the server
2006-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	ogra		and please dont kill the dbus as __mikem advised, that will break
2006-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	are you logged in at the same time with the same user from a client ?
2006-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	no, I'm only on the server.
2006-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	removing gnome-power-manager removes gnome-session too!!!!
2006-06-08T06:16:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	hmm, thats weird, on the server dbus shouldnt complain ...
2006-06-08T06:18:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	hmm then just remove it from the default session with the gnome-session-remove command
2006-06-08T06:21:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	I gnome-session-remove gnome-power-manager, but I wonder: did I remove from the whole server or only from my user?
2006-06-08T06:21:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	only from your users session
2006-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	and will that solve the problem with the users on the clients hybernating the server?
2006-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	to remove it for all users just remove (backup) /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-power-manager.desktop
2006-06-08T06:24:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	renaming it in the same directory?
2006-06-08T06:25:00.000Z	ogra	paolo_	asl long as it doesnt end in .desktop it should be fine
2006-06-08T06:26:00.000Z	paolo_	ogra	ok
