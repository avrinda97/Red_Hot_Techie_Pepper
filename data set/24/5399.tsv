2009-05-23T20:46:00.000Z	m0r0n		Hey, can someone help me install ext2 properly
2009-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	m0r0n		Ext2
2009-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	m0r0n		Which I'm trying to use too
2009-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	Ext2 why?
2009-05-23T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	well like normal then, crate in partition editor on live cd
2009-05-23T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	or in an install if you got unallocated space
2009-05-23T21:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	that makes sense put the data on the Linux drive, but first you need to move it over
2009-07-16T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	 Nitsuaga,   I  like Banshee,  even though it's mono, and there is FUD about mono on the net
2009-07-16T01:05:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	mono all the time? and what do you mean by " there is FUD about mono on the net" I can make it stereo?
2009-07-16T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	some people think Mono is bad, because  it's  basically the open source version of  Microsoft .NET
2009-07-16T01:07:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	spree:  Ah, thanks and I'm running banshee right now, seems like something I can like eventually how do I get the lyrics plugin?
2009-07-24T21:28:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	 Hey, do you know how to mount Disk Drives?
2009-07-24T21:31:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	So apparently it is mounted..  It's just not reading
2009-07-24T21:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	what type of partition?
2009-07-24T21:31:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	Disk drive, audio CD
2009-07-24T21:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	unless your CD's gone bad I suppouse
2009-07-24T21:32:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	Ya, Let me swap disk drives brb
2009-08-01T07:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	ah ok nevermind then
2009-08-01T07:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	their wine repo gets you the latest version,  which is a beta or development
2009-08-01T07:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	your pastebin looks a bit odd,  were you trying to  add http://www.winehq.org repo for  Ubuntu ?
2009-08-01T07:30:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	 Ok before I just make myself feel like more of a dumbass, mind explaining what the repositories are?
2009-08-01T07:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	m0r0n	just got the bot  to before I  read your message
2009-08-01T07:51:00.000Z	m0r0n	sebsebseb	danbhfive:  Thank you both. It's working
