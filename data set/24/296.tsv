2012-02-16T02:53:00.000Z	marcus_		no. where the mouse pointer is supposed to be is now a rainbow square.
2012-02-16T02:54:00.000Z	marcus_		yep. everything else is normal
2012-02-16T02:55:00.000Z	marcus_		post where?
2012-02-16T02:56:00.000Z	marcus_		now it just got really weird...the mouse like normal in the screenshot...
2012-02-16T02:57:00.000Z	marcus_		no
2012-02-16T02:57:00.000Z	marcus_		just regular.....
2012-02-16T02:59:00.000Z	marcus_		I did try to follow some instructions about compiz, but that didn't help
2012-02-16T03:01:00.000Z	marcus_		why would it look one way on the screen and normal on the screenshot?
2012-02-16T03:02:00.000Z	marcus_		I did try adding gnome-tweak-tool, but I never could figure out how to run it.
2012-02-16T03:04:00.000Z	marcus_		asking again.....My mouse pointer is showing as a rainbox square, but when I take a screen shot, it looks normal in the picture.
2012-02-16T03:05:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	What is a "rainbox sqaure"?
2012-02-16T03:05:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Is that a rainbow?
2012-02-16T03:05:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Can you take a screenshot and upload it somewhere for us to see?
2012-02-16T03:07:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	I forgot, it makes your cursor vanish when taking it. Do you have a camera or a camera phone to take a picture of your screen?
2012-02-16T03:14:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	If you want it fast just do www.imgur.com
2012-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	I've never seen this happen before.
2012-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	What graphics card do you have?
2012-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Do you have the proper drivers for it installed on Ubuntu?
2012-02-16T03:16:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Update of what?
2012-02-16T03:16:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	The drivers?
2012-02-16T03:17:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Intresting. I wonder if there is a problem between the security updates and the drivers. Is there any new driver updates available?
2012-02-16T03:21:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Is there any Ubuntu updates available?
2012-02-16T03:21:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Go into terminal and type "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get upgrade" to update if there is anymore. Just do it to check.
2012-02-16T03:23:00.000Z	_John	marcus_	Restart your system. See if the cursor is back to normal.
