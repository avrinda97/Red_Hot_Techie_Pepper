2010-03-21T18:31:00.000Z	Milp		i keep getting errors and ignores when doing apt-get update, what is going wrong? D:
2010-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	what errors?
2010-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	Milp		it says "ign" infront of the repository line, and gives 404s
2010-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	Milp		even though the repository is working and so is my internet
2010-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	are those ign on official repositories?
2010-03-21T18:32:00.000Z	Milp		yes
2010-03-21T18:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	try changing your server in Software Sources
2010-03-21T18:33:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	i did that already, it didnt help
2010-03-21T18:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	what version of Ubuntu?
2010-03-21T18:34:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	Karmic on the Arm architecture
2010-03-21T18:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	are those for Translation?>
2010-03-21T18:35:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	Not really, i took it from the normal wiki
2010-03-21T18:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	at the end og the ign line it should tell you what section of the repos
2010-03-21T18:35:00.000Z	IdleOne		of*
2010-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	all of them pretty much fail to load
2010-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	i get no packages available at all
2010-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	hmm can you pastebin your sources.list please
2010-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	yes one moment
2010-03-21T18:37:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	pastebin.com/hXk2Gues
2010-03-21T18:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	cz is a czech repo correct? if you change it to main does it give same errors?
2010-03-21T18:39:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	I tried US, CZ and german already, but i think im onto the problem: I need to use the ubuntu ports repository, not the normal one i think
2010-03-21T18:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	I don't know what the ports repository is but you seem to have figured something out :)
2010-03-21T18:41:00.000Z	Milp	IdleOne	it seems to be some special repo for those ubuntu ports to other processor architectures, thanks for the help :D
2010-03-21T18:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	Milp	ahh ok, you did mention ARM
