2008-08-04T01:29:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy		packages.ubuntu.com seams to be down, does anyone know of a repos for qmail?
2008-08-04T01:30:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	i don't know why, as i've never cared enough to know why exactly, but most mail nerds say never used a packaged qmail... i think it's just cuz of the timely updates
2008-08-04T01:34:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	you're going to like ubuntu just for the fact that your compile times will be 0 :)... most of th etime... but no, i've actually switched completely off gentoo at home
2008-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	now to get all my programs back to order
2008-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	actually today i was thinking bout how i missed the configurability of gentoo, when i decided to install gnome on a crap laptop; then i decided... no.. i don't
2008-08-04T01:36:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	yeah but if you backed up your home dir, you're good
2008-08-04T01:36:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	gentoo would be like...afew hours
2008-08-04T01:37:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	I have my harddrives that has everything, i just have to get my new system in order
2008-08-04T01:38:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	I learned linux via gentoo, was definitely an advantage... i know way more than most ppl i know do... and it's saved many asses as well.... but I first played with gentoo on like the 3rd or 4th release on an old Dell laptop; p90 w/64mb EDO ram... i attempted to compile KDE, and after 7 days i said "$*&# this" and compiled fluxbox in about 5 minutes; lol
2008-08-04T01:39:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	i been using fluxbox for the last 6  years
2008-08-04T01:39:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	now using gnome from ubuntu
2008-08-04T01:40:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	yeah i used it for about that long as well, then fell in love with xfce while i was in gentoo
2008-08-04T01:40:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	if you like flux's minimalism, but like gnome's cool plugin capability, then xfce is for you; otherwise gnome==winxp to me
2008-08-04T01:41:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	and the XUbuntu team has done wonders to actually make it a more robust experience than stock (ie via gentoo's emerge or a manual source compile)
2008-08-04T01:41:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	i didn't like xfce
2008-08-04T01:41:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	really? i love it compared to the other WMs... gnome is just too bloated for my taste
2008-08-04T01:43:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	i like installed ubuntu like yesterday
2008-08-04T01:44:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	does not know how to use the apt-get source :-/
2008-08-04T01:46:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	qmail-src could not be found
2008-08-04T01:47:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	oh, trying to get the source? yeah not all pkgs have the source set up; might just have to get it from the main site
2008-08-04T01:48:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	o, and do the make install with it
2008-08-04T01:50:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	http://www.paralipsis.org/2006/03/ubuntu-qmail-howto/
2008-08-04T01:50:00.000Z	KlrSp1	JDLSpeedy	but patches might not work if versions are different
2008-08-04T01:51:00.000Z	JDLSpeedy	KlrSp1	o ok, thx
