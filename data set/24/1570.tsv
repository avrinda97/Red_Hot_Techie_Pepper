2009-11-18T17:12:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- Re: Random +8800 -- Are you suggesting any card greater than the 8800 series?
2009-11-18T17:13:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	yes, depending on what you want to do. A simple +40$ card would suffice
2009-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	Ubottu is a bot, the HCL will tell you that most nvidia cards are supported.
2009-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- it sucks, bc I have a $60.00 ATI card I bought last year at this time. :( BUT, I will buy a new nVidia card in a heart beat if that is the issue.
2009-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	what exactly is the problem?

2009-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- video, DVD, Compiz, they all work great. The only thing that doesn't work right is Flash. It tears while streaming from hulu/youtube, etc.
2009-11-18T17:17:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	what version are you using, sometimes a purge and install from the site will do the trick
2009-11-18T17:17:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- my video card is not listed in that ATI list.
2009-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	What version of what? PS. I haven't installed any drivers for my video card at all. I'm just using whatever default drivers ubuntu has.
2009-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	and why have you not installed the video drivers?
2009-11-18T17:24:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	-- Sorry... ;)
2009-11-18T17:25:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	which xorg is 9.10 using?
2009-11-18T17:30:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	klpt1 bazhang - I searched for glxgears in synapitic and I have mesa-utils installed.
2009-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	you need the restricted drivers
2009-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- what restricted drivers? I'm looking at installing the ATI Radeon drivers for my video card...are you saying I shouldn't do that?
2009-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- sorry I didn't see that last post at first. What should I search for in hard where drivers?
2009-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	should only be a search
2009-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- I can't do searches in the hardware drivers
2009-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	you might need to configure aptitude to run with restricted sources
2009-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- when I pull up the hardware drivers window it doesn't list any drivers at all
2009-11-18T17:40:00.000Z	Spixx	anarcap	System > Administration > Software sources > check so that Proprieatary drivers for devices is checked
2009-11-18T17:41:00.000Z	anarcap	Spixx	- Proprietary drivers is checked already.
