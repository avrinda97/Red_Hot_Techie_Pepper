2005-07-26T08:28:00.000Z	hume		hi...i'm new to ubuntu - when I install new programs, they are not included in the menus in gnome or KDE - how do i make them appear there?
2005-07-26T08:28:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	you can use smeg for that
2005-07-26T08:28:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	smeg?
2005-07-26T08:29:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	poke Amaranth
2005-07-26T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	install script
2005-08-01T12:28:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	the easier solution is to change the UID on one of the systems
2005-08-01T12:29:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	can I just change UID without creating a new user and doing all that work?
2005-08-01T12:29:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	possibly, but you would need to chown all files for the affected users too
2005-08-01T12:41:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	is there a way to change the user namne for the user uid=1000?
2005-08-01T12:41:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	elog that user out, login as root and edit /etc/fstan and /etc/shadow
2005-08-10T07:08:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	reboot
2005-08-10T07:08:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	i did
2005-08-10T07:43:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	you can set it in xorg.conf
2005-08-10T07:44:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	then i'd need to restart X to make changes take effect, right?
2005-08-10T07:44:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	correct
2005-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	sudo update-inetd --enable swat
2005-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	you also need to set a root password
2005-09-11T16:09:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	thx, now it seems to work
2005-09-11T16:18:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	when trying to smbmount a share it complains about smbmnt must be installed suid root...... how to do that? sorry for stupid question
2005-09-11T16:19:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	you don't, use sudo for doing that as root
2005-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	hume	Seveas	it complains about "fail to find real path to mount point" when trying smbmount to /mnt .... is that to do with the sudo sttuff?
2005-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	no that's because you do something wrong :)
2005-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	hume	for easy samba mounting: http://ubuntulinux.nl/files/addsamba
