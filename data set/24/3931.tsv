2007-08-31T15:25:00.000Z	Tatara		well, ati radeon 9550 256mb problems
2007-08-31T15:25:00.000Z	Tatara		i installed the orijinal ati drivers from it's site
2007-08-31T15:25:00.000Z	Tatara		aron: but, i missed something, so the 3d does not work
2007-08-31T15:25:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	it's arun :)
2007-08-31T15:10:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	I dont think you can do that on Ubuntu, that's a KDE feature as of now
2007-08-31T15:10:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	well, is there anything i can do about it?
2007-08-31T15:11:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	i think so.. hold on, i'd seen a workaround for this
2007-08-31T15:11:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	ok..:) waiting here..
2007-08-31T15:12:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	http://wallpapoz.akbarhome.com/
2007-08-31T15:12:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	this will let you use different wallpapers for different workspaces
2007-08-31T15:12:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	ok, checkin immediately..:)
2007-08-31T15:13:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	but am i wrong or not: it says it works in beryl/compiz... only in it? i don't have beryl or compz
2007-08-31T15:14:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	it's not only for beryl
2007-08-31T15:15:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	actually
2007-08-31T15:15:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	ok, tried to find it from synaptic... no results..:(
2007-08-31T15:15:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	i dont know if you should try it out.. it might require you to compile stuff
2007-08-31T15:15:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	compile?
2007-08-31T15:16:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	some applications are not in synaptic and you require to 'compile' them from the source code. not nice.
2007-08-31T15:17:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	are you shifting to gnome from kde?
2007-08-31T15:18:00.000Z	Tatara	arun	no, i think not yet, why?
2007-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	i was used to using different wallpapers for different desktops in kde, i used to like that a lot. cant do it here though
2007-08-31T15:23:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	what problems?
2007-08-31T15:23:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	sorry, got disconnected. what problems
2007-08-31T15:26:00.000Z	arun	Tatara	don't know too much about ati cards.. have you checked the community documentation for ati cards?
