2010-01-30T22:42:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	did you google about your printer?
2010-01-30T22:43:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	yes. got some links. installed canon driver. all people say that it is working for them. but, for me, it is not working. it is simply silent

2010-01-30T22:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	so you followed the guide and nothing happens with the printer now, did you get any error ?
2010-01-30T22:48:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	read the section "Status Monitor"
2010-01-30T22:49:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	for me, it shows nothing. and the printer is not printing
2010-01-30T22:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	you are not presented with any gui ?
2010-01-30T22:50:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	yes. a gui wondow comes. but, there is no status message
2010-01-30T22:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	can you see the status of your printer from the terminal?
2010-01-30T22:51:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	yes. it tells as "modified"
2010-01-30T22:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	sudo /etc/init.d/ccpd status what does this tell you ?

2010-01-30T22:54:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	i am getting only one process. doc says that there should be two
2010-01-30T22:54:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	go through the docs again, see if you have missed anything
2010-01-30T22:55:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	will come soon. thanks
2010-01-30T22:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	sure...
2010-01-30T23:11:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	hi. restart also not helping
2010-01-30T23:11:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	redo the doc again, better ask again in the channel
2010-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	captstatusui says that "Check the <Printer ***> of /etc/ccpd.conf"
2010-01-30T23:12:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	shrini	i think there is trouble shoot entry for that
2010-01-30T23:13:00.000Z	shrini	arvind_khadri	yes. i too thnk so.
