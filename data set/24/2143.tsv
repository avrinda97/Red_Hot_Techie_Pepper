2010-03-06T03:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Kangarooo	for bugs?
2010-03-06T03:50:00.000Z	Kangarooo	bazhang	for example in LP bug report someone ask me to do some command. i can do command and output paste to bug or output make to file and upload file. but easyr would be like command | ubuntu-bug bugnumber or just command | ubuntu-bug and in LP i would search the bug i want the files to be added to.
2010-03-06T03:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Kangarooo	not certain there, especially as you have to have a launchpad account and be logged in to respond, as far as I know
2010-03-06T03:57:00.000Z	Kangarooo	bazhang	yes of course i need to be loged in. but so now there isnt such command like pastebinit only for launchpad ?
