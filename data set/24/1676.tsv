2009-10-09T18:20:00.000Z	Schweiz		Good afternoon. I'd have a little stupid question : I can't watch a video without a graphic card, is there a way to solve this problem without adding such a card ? Totem and VLC crash when I try to watch a video without a graphic card. When I add one, it works fine, but since the card is a bit too wide for my computer, it's not a good way to solve this problem.
2009-10-09T18:21:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	you have a graphics adapter or you wouldn't see anything on your monitor
2009-10-09T18:22:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	yes, I've one on the main board, but I cannot watch a video when I use it, I have to plug a card
2009-10-09T18:22:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	what card and what version of ubuntu?
2009-10-09T18:25:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	I'm using ubuntu 9.04, and I think the card is an old geforce 2. It works fine, but since I'm using a ...err... "flat tower" computer, the card is too wide. The computer cannot close when it is plugged in. When I do not use the graphic card but the mainboard's output, totem and vlc crashes when I open a video (the terminal tells me it is a bad alloc problem). Any idea of what I...
2009-10-09T18:26:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	did you install the nvidia driver for your card?
2009-10-09T18:28:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	I don't, and  don't think I need to. The card is not the problem, the mainboard's graphic chip is. The card is about one inch too wide for my computer, so I won't use it, therefore I'd like the graphic chip to work correctly.
2009-10-09T18:28:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	what is the onboard chip?
2009-10-09T18:31:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	that is a good question. I'll try to search for the specifications of my computer
2009-10-09T18:31:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	lspci
2009-10-09T18:32:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	thank you, I give you the result in one minute
2009-10-09T18:33:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	I see nothing which looks a vga controller : http://pastebin.com/debf8055
2009-10-09T18:35:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	line 13 in the post 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV11 [GeForce2 MX/MX 400] (rev a1)
2009-10-09T18:35:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	is the card plugged in right now?
2009-10-09T18:35:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	that is the graphic card I'd like not to use, yes
2009-10-09T18:35:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	hmm, it may be hiding the vga controler, I should reboot without the card, shouldn't I ?
2009-10-09T18:36:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	ok, it probably disabled the onboard chip when you plugged it in, shutdown and remove the card, power up and run the same command and post the results
2009-10-09T18:36:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	okay, I'm back in a few minutes, thank for your help
2009-10-09T18:53:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	I'm back ... and I think I solved the problem. I had problems to connect to freenode, and while waiting, I looked read forums messages about my controler.
2009-10-09T18:54:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	so you got it working?
2009-10-09T18:54:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	it seems that by default my computer redirects the video output to something that does not exists. I told VLC to redirect it to Opengl or X11 and it works now. That is strange. It still does not work with totem, but I guess I can live with that.
2009-10-09T18:55:00.000Z	Halitech	Schweiz	vlc I find it better anyway :)
2009-10-09T18:56:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	yes, me too, but I use totem for reading mp3's. I'm gonna try to open the movie with totem from a remote computer, with ssh. I wonder what it'll do
2009-10-09T18:59:00.000Z	Schweiz	Halitech	thank you very much for your help and have a good day :)
