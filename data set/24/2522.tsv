2010-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	Kevin`		btw, I really wish the ubuntu installer had an option THAT WORKED to not use framebuffer
2010-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	you are not allone with that wish
2010-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	you can expand while in use
2010-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	not while they are mounted
2010-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	try it

2010-09-19T08:36:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	i think with LVM it is a different story
2010-09-19T08:37:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	you can do it with other types of storage too, provided you can get it to become resized
2010-09-19T08:37:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	i am not using LVM, so i cant resize while mounted
2010-09-19T08:37:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	 i just checked gparted, "resize" is grayed out while mounted
2010-09-19T08:38:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	probably because of the type of partition. you COULD resize it in the partition table, reboot, then resize the filesystem (while it's in use) though
2010-09-19T08:39:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	wow...!?
2010-09-19T08:39:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	?
2010-09-19T08:39:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	anyway, just serves to indicate use lvm cuz it's awesome ;)
2010-09-19T09:15:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	WillPittenger: a funny way to disable gdm (or any other script in /etc/init.d/) is chmod 000 /etc/init.d/whatever
2010-09-19T09:15:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	that's so wrong :)
2010-09-19T09:15:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	thats useful in case it is only temporary - you will get a warning at the boot screen, so you wont forget it.
2010-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	WillPittenger: one can edit the runlevel things with sysv-rc-conf easily.
2010-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	except gdm is an upstart thingy not sysv
2010-09-19T09:18:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	omg you are so right... in my last ubuntu version, it was still working with sysv-rc-conf, now it is already disabled. I dont like upstart. *whine*
2010-09-19T09:23:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ lots to read though
2010-09-19T09:23:00.000Z	Kevin`	hmw	I mean something to point users to who ask questions like LinuxGuy2009's
2010-09-19T09:23:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	google.com
2010-09-19T09:28:00.000Z	hmw	Kevin`	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting but thats really for the bash, not for Linux in general. A simple tutorial, that covers all important things is an oxymoron, i fear.
