2008-12-14T11:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Might I suggest #ubuntu-offtopic?
2008-12-14T11:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	This channel is for Ubuntu support, not general support, nor general Ubuntu.  Just Ubuntu support
2009-04-05T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Any recent Ubuntu version shouldn't give you a hd* but should give you a sd* name.
2009-04-05T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	No.  They could/are both correct.  hd* are PATA drives, sd* are SATA.  Recent Linux versions have merged everything into sd*, and on some hardware IDE comes first, others IDE comes second.
2009-04-05T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	So, under the old style, you have sda and hda, and then under the new one, one of those is sda and the other is sdb.  Obviously in this case, sda -> sda and hda -> sdb
2009-04-05T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	One SATA drive is sdb?  Your first, or second SATA drive?
2009-04-05T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	ok.  And whats the question then?
2009-04-05T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Yes.  hd* won't appear on newer kernels, they've got a sata emulation layer in there.
2009-04-05T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Now everything is sd*
2009-04-05T10:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Newer kernel, yeah.
2009-09-25T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Yes: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation#Installing%20on%20external%20or%20RAID%20hard%20disks
2009-10-29T05:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Please see the /topic in #ubuntu-release-party
2009-10-29T05:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	This channel is for Ubuntu support, not release announcements.  But to answer: Sometime before it's the 30th everywhere.
2009-10-29T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	There is no answer.  And again, this channel is for support, not discussion of Ubuntu.
2009-10-29T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	There's 1500 people here, if we have discussions/conversations, no one gets support.
2009-10-29T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	Someone probably directed you to the wrong channel then.  No one should send you somewhere with zero people on purpose.
2010-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Roasted	azm: please stop that.
2010-05-16T01:31:00.000Z	Roasted	Flannel	lol????
