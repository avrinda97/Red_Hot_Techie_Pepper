2005-05-01T05:41:00.000Z	CB201		I can't mount my audio CD in XMMS
2005-05-01T05:42:00.000Z	CB201		I tried using the Audio Cd player plugin
2005-05-01T05:42:00.000Z	CB201		with no success
2005-05-01T05:43:00.000Z	CB201		can any ubuntu/XMMS users out there tell me which directory I should put under Device in the CD plugin
2005-05-01T05:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	/media/cdrom0 usually
2005-05-01T05:45:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	I tried /media/cdrom0
2005-05-01T05:45:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	I ran the Check CD option and got nothing
2005-05-01T05:46:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	the error is Failed to Read Table of Contents
2005-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	is your cd scratched up ?
2005-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	CB201		LinuxJones...no...
2005-05-01T05:49:00.000Z	CB201		it keeps suggesting that there's no disk in the drive
2005-05-01T05:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	double click the icon on the desktop when you put a cd in the drive
2005-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	I'm not running GNOME so there is no CD
2005-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	CB201		*icon
2005-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	what are you running ?
2005-05-01T05:50:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	fluxbox
2005-05-01T05:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	 do you have the cd mounted ? type sudo mount | grep cdrom
2005-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	CB201		omg, I was just told that I don't need to mount audio CDs
2005-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	CB201		going around in circles here
2005-05-01T05:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CB201	 I havn't been following your entire conversation dude
2005-05-01T05:53:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	whenever I try to mount an audio CD I get an error telling me it's the wrong type of files
2005-05-01T05:54:00.000Z	CB201	LinuxJones	that doesn't happen when I try to read from normal data CDs
