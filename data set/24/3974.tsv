2007-08-16T10:58:00.000Z	seanpcrowe		is there a way to select which driver kubuntu uses for the trackpad??? cause it currentally thinks its a standard mouse,..
2007-08-16T10:59:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-08-16T10:59:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	as it stands no
2007-08-16T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	there is an ncurses (command line wizard) interface: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-08-16T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	but this will have you reconfigure the whole X server, vidoe, etc
2007-08-16T11:02:00.000Z	seanpcrowe	xtknight	i wouldn't wanna do that because kubuntu has a hard time of reconising my intel GMA945 GFX... i might lose my 1280x800 res...
2007-08-16T11:04:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-08-16T11:04:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	change the "input" driver to what you want, e.g. "synaptics" for synaptics touchpads
2007-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	seanpcrowe	xtknight	i tried that with johnshortlands help... it just stops x from loading
2007-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	i need the "lspci -n" line for your trackpad
2007-08-16T11:06:00.000Z	seanpcrowe	xtknight	i dont know what that means... i'm a leenox n00b dude :s
2007-08-16T11:06:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	ok
2007-08-16T11:06:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	open a terminal
2007-08-16T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	type "sudo lshw" and pastebin it

2007-08-16T11:11:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	ok, well unfortunately i dont see a touchpad entry in here
2007-08-16T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	seanpcrowe	it means i have no idea how to fix your problem, essentially.  you can give me "lspci" and "lsusb" also just to see..
