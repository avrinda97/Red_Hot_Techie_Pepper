2008-10-31T04:12:00.000Z	ldiamond		Can anyone help me? I'm dropping in BusyBox instead of loading the Live CD?
2008-10-31T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	did you run "check the cd for defects" from the CD's boot menu?
2008-10-31T04:13:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	I dont get in the CD's boot menu. I'm using grub to boot the image from a hard drive.
2008-10-31T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	you need to mention that you are not just booting straight from the cd...
2008-10-31T04:17:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	I am
2008-10-31T04:18:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	I am (mentioning it)
2008-10-31T04:18:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	/usr/share/gnome/default.session doesn't exist now though
2008-11-05T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	bash
2008-11-05T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	you want bash
2008-11-05T07:01:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	when I try to run bash, nothing happens
2008-11-05T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	bash is your default shell anyway
2008-11-05T07:02:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	then it doesnt work. I cant have more than one line.
2008-11-05T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	you need to pastebin what you are referring to.  "Can't have more than one line?"
2008-11-05T07:03:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	Suppose I want to declare a variable, then do something with it. I cant do that in bash
2008-11-05T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	why not?  How are you trying?
2008-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	I tried suppose: plik=~/w <enter> echo plik <enter> but plik isnt defined anymore
2008-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	you need to export variables
2008-11-05T07:04:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	humm, I must be mistaken, using a simpler example seemed to work
2008-11-05T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	if you want variables you define to stay defined in child processes you do "export foo=bar"
2008-11-09T23:48:00.000Z	ldiamond	jrib	the kernel is the same isnt it?
2008-11-09T23:48:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	no
2008-11-09T23:49:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	apt-cache show linux-image-server
2009-05-23T19:13:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	/join #bash
2009-05-23T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	ldiamond	maybe with expect
