2008-08-07T02:56:00.000Z	Pelo		evening folks, I setup ubuntu on my neighbour's computer,   she doesn't want her daughter to have admin permission but the daughter is the one that uses the computer most,   I set the updates to auto-download  ,  will the comp get updated from automaticly from the daughter,s account or will they still need to login to the admin account to install the updates ?
2008-08-07T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	make sure her account is not a member of sudo
2008-08-07T02:58:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	it's not , I made sure
2008-08-07T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	upgrade only
2008-08-07T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	dist-upgrade is for kernel upgrades etc
2008-08-17T02:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	 please bother reading what ppl write,  he was asing his quesiton
2008-08-17T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	he never said he'd tried it, so I was asking if he had or not
2008-08-17T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	 take a chill pill
2008-08-17T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	it was a simple question
2008-08-17T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	if he had he could have said "yes" and i'd move on
2008-11-14T17:38:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	nice find :-)
2008-11-14T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	ask.com pwns

2010-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	I recommend you run:   export EDITOR=nano    first
2010-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	thanks
2010-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	already running nano can't get the hang of vi
2010-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	me neither
2011-10-27T22:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	there are plenty of alternative desktops
2011-10-27T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	unity is an ubuntu product. If you use other gnome3 based distros they will use gnome-shell more than likely
2011-10-27T22:52:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	gnome-shell is installed, I just find gnome3 lacking in simplicity
2011-10-27T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	i see. I've been and LXDE and KDE kinda guy. I find gnome too fussy. It has to do a little dance before it does anything
2011-10-27T22:55:00.000Z	Pelo	ActionParsnip	use to be you could rightclick on anything and get options,  no longer
2011-10-27T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	still works here. You can even rightclick the unity bar items for a cheeky menu
2012-11-07T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pelo	its also a sea creature
