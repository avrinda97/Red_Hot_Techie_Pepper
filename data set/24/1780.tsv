2009-08-27T15:51:00.000Z	cowiecow		Oh yeah. I also started playing with a little amateur photography lately. I feel that as a library F-Spot doesn't do the trick very well (especially since I came from the Mac world, so I found Aperture and iPhoto VERY good for organizing my photos). Are there any other GTK-based deals that help out with this? I know digiKam exists for Qt/KDE, but I'd very much prefer something GTK.
2009-08-27T15:52:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	gtkam
2009-08-27T15:54:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Does it have the ability to still touch them up a bit like F-Spot? Or is it strict library?
2009-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	i don't remember :)
2009-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	you'll have to try it and see
2009-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Aight. Thankies.
2009-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	I'm used to gimping them anyway
2009-08-27T15:56:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Yah. I mean, I could always GIMP/Photoshop/whatever them too, but having the ability to make subtle lighting, etc. changes as I need be without waiting for GIMP to open up would be MUCH nicer.
2009-08-27T15:57:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	like I said, you'll have to try it out. if it doesn't have it, make a feature request or write it in yourself
2009-08-27T15:57:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	I don't think gtkam supports my model of camera. It's a Kodak V1073, so I'll probably go request it or figure something out.
2009-08-27T15:58:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	really? it works just fine on mine, since it uses libusb
2009-08-27T15:59:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	hrm, you're right, I don't see the V1073 in the list
2009-08-27T16:00:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	It's a fairly new camera. It wouldn't surprise me if it weren't there. It's a point-and-shoot too, so it's not one of the big boys.
2009-08-27T16:01:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	ah, yeah, that line of the easyshares leaves a bit to be desired... does it take the picture right away, as soon as you press the button, or does it wait a second before actually taking it?
2009-08-27T16:02:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Pretty much right away. I've actually been rather satisfied with it for the most part.
2009-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	No wait or anything. My main gripe is that compared to my old Nikon Coolpix, the pictures aren't as sharp all the time. That Nikon Coolpix L6 got some REALLY sharp pictures. But the video quality of the Kodak V1073 managed to get HD video, so I liked it. Unfortunately, gtkam doesn't. D:
2009-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	cool. I've got a Z730 that's done pretty well. I was able to capture Jupiter, Mars and Vega with it recently.
2009-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Really? I was thinking of getting one of the Z series earlier, but I ended up going for the V series. I hear lots of good things from the Z line though.
2009-08-27T16:04:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	that would be a really nice camera to be supported by libgphoto
2009-08-27T16:04:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Yeah, I get what you mean. lol
2009-08-27T16:05:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	yeah, I would talk to the libgphoto people and see if there's a way they can work with you to get it supported: http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php
2009-08-27T16:05:00.000Z	cowiecow	Gnea	Thankies.
2009-08-27T16:06:00.000Z	Gnea	cowiecow	I mean, if I were you. :)
