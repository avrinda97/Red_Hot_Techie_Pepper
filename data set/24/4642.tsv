2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	dabide		need help (<- very new to linux/ubuntu): when i try to "sudo apt-get install cupsys" i get "Package cupsys is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	dabide		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	dabide		is only available from another source
2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	dabide		E: Package cupsys has no installation candidate
2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	dabide		sry
2007-02-25T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	pastebin this file:  /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-25T15:23:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	i've uncommented all sources, so  i should be connectable to "universe"
2007-02-25T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	it's not in universe
2007-02-25T15:28:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7539/ , this is my sources.lis (ive copied it from a forum as mine didnt work with everything uncommented)
2007-02-25T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	make yourself a decent one here, that one repeats stuff:
2007-02-25T15:36:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7541/ , my new sources.list but the error "E: Package cupsys has no installation candidate" still remains, after saving the sources.list i run "sudo apt-get update" and got many "101 Netowrk is unreachable" errors
2007-02-25T15:36:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cupsys
2007-02-25T15:37:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	i run both commands, but the error remains
2007-02-25T15:38:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	this is the whole msg i get after sudo apt-get install cupsys "Package cupsys is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source
2007-02-25T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	can you pastebin the output of 'sudo apt-get update' then?
2007-02-25T15:43:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7548/ the output of sudo apt-get update after creating the new sources.list - this is not the whole output, as i dont get all on the screen, and cant paste everything to pastebin
2007-02-25T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	edit your sources.list and remove all of "at." stuff
2007-02-25T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	you have internet access on the pc right?  Do you use a proxy?
2007-02-25T15:50:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	yes internet connection is up, not using a proxy, but i'm going to re-check, brb in 5mins
2007-04-14T13:45:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	rtorrer, btdownload*
2007-04-14T13:45:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	I mean: rtorrent
2007-04-14T13:46:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	: k, thx
2007-04-14T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	dabide	dpkg -L rtorrent    but you shouldn't need to know that
2007-04-14T14:28:00.000Z	dabide	jrib	i need to change the config file
