2007-12-28T11:55:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	how about the tried and true vlc?
2007-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	does the dvd work in a dvd player (next to a tv for example)?
2007-12-28T12:03:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	yes
2007-12-28T12:06:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	when you put the dvd in the drive, does it prompt you with some options? like play in totem etc? what does totem say when it refuses to run it if anything
2007-12-28T12:07:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	"an error occured/could not open location; you might not have permission to open the file."
2007-12-28T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	and all other dvds work? is this a bluray or hd-dvd?
2007-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	all that I have tried before work. this is a proper dvd
2007-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	that is exceedingly odd..
2007-12-28T12:10:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	that is on dvd already?

2007-12-28T12:14:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	to prevent teh piratez
2007-12-28T12:15:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	you can return it or wait for a 'fix' :}
2007-12-28T12:19:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	I have to return it anyway I think. do you know how to get a raw dump of the disc and work out the proper file format later?
2007-12-28T12:20:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	for now it is safe from that kind of thing, not really the channel to discuss it in
2007-12-28T12:20:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	what would be
2007-12-28T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	that is a 'rip' and there is google for that
2007-12-28T12:22:00.000Z	kevin_	bazhang	I don't want to resort to windows shareware, which is the result on google
2007-12-28T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	sorry cant help you
2008-06-30T08:46:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin_	we need a question
