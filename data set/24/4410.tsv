2007-10-04T09:33:00.000Z	underwatercow		Is anyone in here familiar with OpenOffice base? I'm trying to create a table using SQL commands...
2007-10-04T09:34:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	OO have an embedded database now?
2007-10-04T09:34:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	If it let me create a database rather than simply connect to a database, would that be a yes?
2007-10-04T09:35:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	am not sure if its really a database, the rows and columns of the calc maybe considered a db
2007-10-04T09:36:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	All I really want to do is run some SQL commands to create tables and insert data, and then run some queries against it
2007-10-04T09:36:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	What's the easiest way to do that?
2007-10-04T09:36:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	get a database and install it, like mysql
2007-10-04T09:37:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	That's why I was hoping I could just use base
2007-10-04T09:37:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	i dont know Base, maybe its a new feature..read the man pages?
2007-10-04T09:40:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	base has a built-in HSQL database, fyi
2007-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	okay, so activate it, and create the jdbc connector to it
2007-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	what does that do?
2007-10-04T09:42:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	to start the database, and connect to it
2007-10-04T09:42:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	I think it set up the JDBC automatically
2007-10-04T09:43:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	well it is, then just use it
2007-10-04T09:44:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	Easier said than done
2007-10-04T09:45:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	did you ever google for tutorials on that?
2007-10-04T09:46:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	I can manipulate the datebase, that's not the problem... the problem is creating and inputting data using SQL commands instead of by GUI
2007-10-04T09:48:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	you can write java codes and use sql commands within it, to connect to hsql
2007-10-04T09:48:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	I found a place to exectue SQL, and I ran a create command, but it says the table is already created, though it's not showing it in the table list...
2007-10-04T09:49:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	the correct schema?
2007-10-04T09:49:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	look into hsql database tutorial
2007-10-04T09:49:00.000Z	underwatercow	bulmer	alright... worst case, I can install MySQL I guess...
2007-10-04T09:50:00.000Z	bulmer	underwatercow	yes you can, hsql is just a toy db
