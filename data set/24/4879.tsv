2007-08-07T12:45:00.000Z	BrendanM		I'm running Xubuntu on a Dell Latitude c610. I was wondering if anyone knows how to set up an external monitor (i.e. clone, extended desktop, etc.)? The video card is an ATI radeon mobility
2007-08-07T12:47:00.000Z	BrendanM		The_giver, have you tried the alternate text installer?
2007-08-07T12:48:00.000Z	BrendanM		Does anyone know why the text installer isn't included somewhere in the regular iso? It seems like it would be easy to do.
2007-08-07T12:48:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	it would not
2007-08-07T12:48:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	the live contains the OS, the alternate contains the packages
2007-08-07T12:50:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	the live CD has to include the packages too, right? I mean, it does INSTALL those packages, right?
2007-08-07T12:51:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	actually not
2007-08-07T12:51:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	i'm not sure, but i think that it brutally copies the live cd to the hd
2007-08-07T12:52:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	which VGA?
2007-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	yes, it's a VGA output. The card is a ATI Radeon Mobility. Right now I'm running the FOSS "ati" driver, but I'd be willing to switch to proprietary drivers if necessary.
2007-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	depends
2007-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	if it's <= 9250 the FOSS drivers rock
2007-08-07T12:56:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	if what is, the card? It's an older card, I think the FOSS drivers are pretty solid.
2007-08-07T12:56:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	lspci | grep -i vga, check
2007-08-07T12:57:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	" ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M6 LY"
2007-08-07T12:57:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	meh
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	indeed.
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	that's all it says?
2007-08-07T13:00:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	Google seems to indicate it's an "M6" chipset
2007-08-07T13:02:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	google for dual head howto
2007-08-07T13:02:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	basically you have to duplicate your monitor and screen sections
2007-08-07T13:03:00.000Z	BrendanM	xstasi	ok thanks. Will that get me an extended desktop? Clone mode seems to be working automagically.
2007-08-07T13:03:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	clone mode is the default behavior
2007-08-07T13:03:00.000Z	xstasi	BrendanM	i would paste my Xorg config, but i'm using fglrx
