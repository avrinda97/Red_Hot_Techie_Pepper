2007-07-23T13:13:00.000Z	dzer0		hello
2007-07-23T13:14:00.000Z	dzer0		I restarted my computer today and all of a sudden, ALSA stopped working. The only way to get sound is to set the output directly to the soundcard instead of ALSA, which lets only 1 app use sound at a time. How can I fix ALSA?
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	run alsamixer from terminal
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	check settings there
2007-07-23T13:15:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	I have 2 sound cards in my system. ALSA is set to the wrong one. How do I set it to the other card?
2007-07-23T13:17:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	sec, there is a command to setup alsa
2007-07-23T13:17:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	thanks :)
2007-07-23T13:24:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	any luck finding that command?
2007-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	check this out
2007-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	juanfelipe@juanfelipe-desk:/usr/sbin$ /etc/init.d/alsa-utils --help

2007-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	dzer0		thanks
2007-07-23T13:27:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	if alsa is messed up , you should try reinstalling it
2007-07-23T13:27:00.000Z	juano__		does anyone know if the beep media player supports full built in minimize to system tray function ? and not like xmms buggy tray plugin ??
2007-07-23T13:27:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	that's what worked last time until I restarted
2007-07-23T13:27:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	how do I find out which card to start/stop using alsa-utils?
2007-07-23T13:29:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	what sound card you have ?
2007-07-23T13:29:00.000Z	dzer0	juano__	some Diamond card...it's labeled as C-Media something or other in the gnome sound settings
2007-07-23T13:30:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	maybe its easier if you try reinstalling alsa
2007-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	sudo apt-get install alsa-base alsa-oss alsa-utils libasound2
2007-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	that could help thoug hif it didnt work on first time
2007-07-23T13:32:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	then we have to keep looking for somethin
2007-07-23T13:32:00.000Z	juano__	dzer0	that wont help much
