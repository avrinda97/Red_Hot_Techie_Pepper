2005-10-10T13:31:00.000Z	mvhenten		Hello, all, I just installed ubuntu, I like it, but where's gcc? what's the ubuntu way of installing it?
2005-10-10T13:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	install the 'build-essential' package
2005-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	look in synaptic
2005-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	system -> administration -> synaptic
2005-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	build-essential is on the ubuntu install CD
2005-10-10T13:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	yeah, that's a slightly simpler interface
2005-10-10T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	just install build-essential ;)
2005-10-10T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	unless you are highly clueful wrt gcc or need a specific version
2005-10-10T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	'build-essential' will install the default
2005-10-10T13:42:00.000Z	mvhenten	HappyFool	I don't think either, just asking
2005-10-10T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	if you are a slackware veteran, ubuntu should be super-easy
2005-10-10T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	running joke, 'ubuntu' is an african word for 'those to lazy to configure slackware'
2005-10-10T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	would it still work?
2005-10-10T13:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	the ubuntu policy is to use sudo, generally
2005-10-10T13:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	yeah, my point was i don't think you'll break anything (that is a guess though)
2005-10-10T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	wiki instructions for installing ati
2005-10-10T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	should be easier than by hand
2005-10-10T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	it's up to you of course ;)
2005-10-10T13:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	only the original user can use sudo, by default
2005-10-13T05:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	isn't there a gcc-3.4 package?
2005-10-13T05:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	do you have non-standard repos ? (marillat, backports, etc.)
2005-10-13T05:22:00.000Z	mvhenten	HappyFool	I didn't do nothing
2005-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	yeah, breezy's not final yet
2005-10-13T05:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mvhenten	sounds like gcc-3.4 shuold 'just work'
