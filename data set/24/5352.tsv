2006-11-01T12:11:00.000Z	iter		seriously disliked by the devs"
2006-11-01T12:12:00.000Z	iter		see I don't really buy that
2006-11-01T12:13:00.000Z	iter		00:58 < DarkMageZ> oranged, automatrix is not supported, and seriously disliked by the ubuntu devs. try a clean install of the system
2006-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	iter		right but for what reason
2006-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	iter		I would argue that the population using automatix is prone to breakage
2006-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	it is a hacked way of installing stuff that is very to easy to install without even using it.   If you check out the wiki or the desktop guide you will be able to get everything going without using it.
2006-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	how is it hacked
2006-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	hacked up way of doing it.
2006-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	a shell script is 'hacked' ?
2006-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	it downloads source for some packages and others it apt-gets from non ubuntu repositories
2006-11-01T12:16:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	as opposed to using apt-get ?
2006-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	NON UBUNTU REPOS is the key portion.  Anytime you are installing third party software from different sources you may have problems upgrading or dist-upgrading in the future.  Its just not recomended if you want a better explaination please just search the forums.  Its been discussed to death.
2006-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	please show me an ubuntu repo for flas
2006-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	look in your sources list
2006-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	why, never installed automatix
2006-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	but I have added repos to get all the normal stuff working
2006-11-01T12:18:00.000Z	iter	chuckyp	I still don't see the point, and saying that "it's been discussed to death" doesn't really help
2006-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	I'm not going to get in a discussion of why it is bad.  I've told you.
2006-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	its not supported here.  Thats pretty much the final answer
2006-11-01T12:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	No i have not.
2006-11-01T12:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	it is the case
2006-11-01T12:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	please go to #automatix or even #ubuntu-offtopic to discuss it.
2006-11-01T12:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	iter	thought police?   You are speaking offtopic
