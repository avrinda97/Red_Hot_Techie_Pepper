2010-02-10T07:30:00.000Z	shadowwulf		Xcrossfire: if i am not mistaken there is something called wine and/or playonlinux for windows programs to work on linux
2010-02-10T07:30:00.000Z	shadowwulf		what is the command to move everything from one folder to another ?
2010-02-10T07:30:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	mv oldDirectory/* newdir/
2010-02-10T07:39:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	Ah, ok, so your destination ir /media/flash/
2010-02-10T07:40:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	yes it is ... but i have a rootfs.cupcake folder ... the contents of that folder need to go to the /media/flash
2010-02-10T07:40:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	cp rootfs.cupcake/* /media/flash/
2010-02-10T07:41:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	i want to delete the cupcake folder
2010-02-10T07:41:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	assuming you're in the directory where rootfs.cupcake also is
2010-02-10T07:41:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	then delete i: rm -r rootfs.cupcake
2010-02-10T07:44:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	didnt copy the folders
2010-02-10T07:44:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	I told you to use cp to copy the contents of the folder
2010-02-10T07:44:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	i did ... but it didnt copy the folders
2010-02-10T07:45:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	i need the folders too
2010-02-10T07:45:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	Which folders?
2010-02-10T07:46:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	 there is a dev sbin and a system folder in the rootfs.cupcake folder
2010-02-10T07:46:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	need to copy them
2010-02-10T07:46:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	Where is your folder rootfs.cupcake?
2010-02-10T07:47:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	OK. So you want to copy all the files inside /media/flash/rootfs.cupcake to /media/flash/ ?
2010-02-10T07:48:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	correct?
2010-02-10T07:49:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	 yep and delete the rootfs.cupcake folder
2010-02-10T07:50:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	Gotcha. We'll use cp (recursively) to copy the files, then rmdir to remove the leftover empty directory.       cp -r /media/flash/rootfs.cupcake/* /media/flash/ && rmdir /mediaflash/rootfs.cupcake
2010-02-10T07:51:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	cool thanks
2010-02-10T07:52:00.000Z	jken146	shadowwulf	Does that make sense?
2010-02-10T07:52:00.000Z	shadowwulf	jken146	 yep got it .. thanks
