2007-02-10T12:17:00.000Z	orionrobots	pulpficti0n	- I am looking at your screenies now.
2007-02-10T12:19:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	see?
2007-02-10T12:21:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	what? it must be primary?
2007-02-10T12:24:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	yeah, that's what i figured.. it should work ok, i did what it's saying to me
2007-02-10T12:28:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	so... should i just give up?
2007-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	it automatically ticks the swap partition.. didn't work
2007-02-10T12:31:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	i also tried with all ext/swap checked and unchecked.. didn't work
2007-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	orionrobots	pulpficti0n	- I don't read spanish(is it?) but I can see the "/" selected..
2007-02-10T12:32:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	portuguese.. yeah, it's moaning saying i don't have a "/" selected, but i surely do
2007-02-10T12:33:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	next
2007-02-10T12:34:00.000Z	orionrobots	pulpficti0n	- Maybe it has not updated the alerts from entering the page.
2007-02-10T12:34:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	nope.. that alert appeared after i clicked next
2007-02-10T12:35:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	it wasn't there when i was editing the entries, it appeared after i clicked next
2007-02-10T12:36:00.000Z	pulpficti0n	orionrobots	it could be a bug, but i doubt it.. i mean, how long this 6.1 have been out?
