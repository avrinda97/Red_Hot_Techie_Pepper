2008-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	hyder		hello? anyone get my question
2008-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	compiz does not work on your system in 7.10
2008-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	It will hopefully work in 8.04
2008-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	hyder	Amaranth	yes nor the wireless card
2008-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	If it is intel wireless it should work fine
2008-03-08T17:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	If it is intel wireless it should work fine
2008-03-08T17:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	But basically if it didn't work right away and it isn't broadcom it probably won't work, period
2008-03-08T17:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	pastebin the output of lspci
2008-03-08T17:22:00.000Z	hyder	Amaranth	http://pastebin.com/m478a65bb
2008-03-08T17:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	this doesn't even list a wireless card, did you turn the killswitch on?
2008-03-08T17:23:00.000Z	hyder	Amaranth	yes the wireless light is on the laptop
2008-03-08T17:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	i dunno what to tell you, according to lspci your laptop does not even have a wireless card, let alone a driver for said card
2008-03-08T17:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	pastebin lsusb
2008-03-08T17:25:00.000Z	hyder	Amaranth	http://pastebin.com/m58186178
2008-03-08T17:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	well that doesn't help :/
2008-03-08T17:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	most likely
2008-03-08T17:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	but we have drivers for some of those
2008-03-08T17:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	and basically if a driver exists it is in ubuntu so a driver most likely does not exist for your wireless
2008-03-08T17:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	because the driver cannot do compiz and Xv (video playback) at the same time
2008-03-08T17:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	hyder	no, because a driver for it does not exist
