2005-04-28T07:30:00.000Z	MMond		I am entirely confused now . . . give a few starting pointers. I typed bluntly "screen" and I'm back to normal gnome-terminal . . . what do I want to do now? I was suggested to use this . . . but kinda confused what it'll achieve me
2005-04-28T07:31:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	with 'screen' you can have several terminals within one, you're actually in screen now even if you can't see it - type ctrl-a h for help
2005-04-28T07:32:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	for gnome-temrinal i'd just open another window instead of using screen, though.. unless you want to be able to detach a terminal session, log off, then reattach it when logging on. that's only possible with screen.
2005-04-28T07:36:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	woops. yes, it's ctrl-a ? (i copied the wrong info)
2005-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	first hold down CTRL and type A, then release CTRL and type ?
2005-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	now you can create new terminal sessions with Ctrl-A C, and switch between them with Ctrl-A P (previous) and Ctrl-A N (next).
2005-04-28T07:40:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	kind of like that, yes. screen is basically a windowing system that works without windows.
2005-04-28T07:40:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	you can even use it on bare terminal screens, you do not need any graphical interface.
2005-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	Sorry to be bringing irssi in this so much . . . but, so it is very alike irssi then . . . for example, going through different channels by pressing Ctrl + P (not even sure if that is the correct shortcut.. but whatever it is, that toggles through channel windows..)
2005-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	a big advantage is that you can detach a session (Ctrl-A D), then log off, then return to the session later with "screen -r".
2005-04-28T07:42:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	that's ok, i'm not familiar with irssi, but it's nice to know a program that works in a similar way.
2005-04-28T07:43:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	irssi the IRC client.. I always thought it was the most prominent Linux IRC client . . . I don't know, maybe BX works that way as well . . .
2005-04-28T07:49:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	sorry, got distracted. Yes, you can close them with 'exit' after creating them with Ctrl-A C.
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	Got it . . . thanks. Still kinda unfamiliar with this . . . but I'll try using it for the next few days 'til I get familiar with this.. I think this is what I wanted
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	try reading the screen manual page (man screen).. all the info is in there.
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	And I almost am where I thought I never would be . . . going at it with complete CLI
2005-04-28T07:51:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	aha... well, good luck :)
2005-04-28T07:52:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	I mean.. using my desktop as complete CLI . . . (recently found w3m . . . and I was like :OOOOOOO) everything working pleasently now
2005-04-28T07:53:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	you can also try booting without any GUI (runlevel 3) and be in total CLI heaven ;)
2005-04-28T07:54:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	How exactly do I do that? Without a click . . . I start off to GUI . . .
2005-04-28T07:55:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	as root, try typing 'init 2' - system will basically reboot everything but the kernel and you'll get a text login prompt
2005-04-28T07:56:00.000Z	MMond	MaCaDe	Gotcha . . . so then on the 7th virtual terminal, X won't be initiated? If I wanted to -- I could "start x" and be back at normal, right? And is this a one-time thing, or will this reset that as default? If yes, what would I have to do to get back to default as it is now?
2005-04-28T07:57:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	one-time thing.. not sure how to make it the default under debian/ubuntu, maybe someone else here knows.
2005-04-28T07:58:00.000Z	MaCaDe	MMond	please forget what i said :)  can someone please explain to MMond how he boots in text-only mode?
