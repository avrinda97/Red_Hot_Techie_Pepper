2007-04-25T07:43:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	thanks... :-(
2007-04-25T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	I am sure there is a manual somewhere you can get the info from
2007-05-01T14:33:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	yep and even if there are few master helpers in there the less experience ppl can share their findings with eachother
2007-05-01T14:34:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	makes sense
2007-05-14T09:51:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	 they have been saying that for years and have yet to act on it, it's called FUD
2007-05-14T09:51:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	thought so
2007-05-14T09:55:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	there is nothing ultimate about that , it's just a repack with an idioticly large default install selection
2007-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	i noticed..
2007-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	the name ultimate just caught my eye
2007-05-14T09:57:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	 have you heard of  ubuntu SE ( satanic edition) ?
2007-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	yeah i have..
2007-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	 you donT' approove ?
2007-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	i'm neutral..
2007-05-14T10:10:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	maybe he doesnt have gui..
2007-08-16T16:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	nvidia-settings I think
2007-10-05T06:32:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	^
2007-10-05T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	probably but I'M not leet enough to recommend stuff like that
2007-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	ok
2007-10-11T07:35:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	i think he can use the default option too
2007-10-11T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	probably but I've never used it
2007-10-11T07:36:00.000Z	DShepherd	Pelo	default number where number is the where it falls in the list. 0 is the first item
2007-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	DShepherd	I know how it works but because of the possible variations it is easier to tell ppl to move the entry to the top of the list
