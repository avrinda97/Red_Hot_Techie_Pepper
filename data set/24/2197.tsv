2009-03-15T20:38:00.000Z	elashish		i just installed 8.04 dual boot on an old toshiba (256MB RAM) and power dies after booting - any ideas why?
2009-03-15T20:39:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	power dies is kinda non descript, what exactly does happen
2009-03-15T20:40:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	you push button, do you see the bios?
2009-03-15T20:40:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	after logging into ubuntu?
2009-03-15T20:41:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	it's on ac constantly?
2009-03-15T20:41:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	correct
2009-03-15T20:41:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	does it happen when you boot into recovery?
2009-03-15T20:42:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	how do i do that - from grub?
2009-03-15T20:42:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	yeah in grub try the rescue option
2009-03-15T20:42:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	okay brb
2009-03-15T20:44:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	I'm in root shell and it's fine, what now
2009-03-15T20:45:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	what was on the laptop before you reinstalled?
2009-03-15T20:45:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	XP
2009-03-15T20:46:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	855GM Intel integrated graphics
2009-03-15T20:49:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	if you dont actually login, but just let the machine load the logon screen, does it crash/hang or reboot?
2009-03-15T20:50:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	let me try
2009-03-15T20:51:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	dont really have a clue as how to solve it though, seems there's an issue with the graphics, could try ubuntu 8.10, it has a better intel driver?
2009-03-15T20:51:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	graphics driver even
2009-03-15T20:52:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	it's a very old machine, only 256MB RAM, will it run okay?
2009-03-15T20:52:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	not really :/
2009-03-15T20:52:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	maybe a little better with xfce
2009-03-15T20:53:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	maybe a lighter distro?
2009-03-15T20:53:00.000Z	elashish	acicula	LXDE might work too
2009-03-15T20:53:00.000Z	acicula	elashish	worth trying i suppose , but i dont know any
