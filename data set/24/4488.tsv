2007-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	meal3837		i'm having trouble installing ubuntu (or any distro, for that matter) on my new computer
2007-04-12T10:38:00.000Z	meal3837		i'm pretty sure it's relatet to the PATA controller on my board
2007-04-12T10:39:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	what happens and what errors do you get?
2007-04-12T10:40:00.000Z	meal3837		to preface, my mobo is an intel dg965ry . . . ICH8 has no native PATA support
2007-04-12T10:40:00.000Z	meal3837		but i get the "cannot access tty" error
2007-04-12T10:41:00.000Z	meal3837		or when i install debian, it just doesn't detect the optical drive
2007-04-12T10:43:00.000Z	meal3837		ajmorris: from what i gather, if i use a SATA optical drive, it bypasses this issue
2007-04-12T10:44:00.000Z	meal3837		ajmorris: i was just hoping there was a "no purchase necessary" work-around
2007-04-12T10:44:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	i don't know if there is one
2007-04-12T10:44:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	i'll do a quick search and see what i can find
2007-04-12T10:45:00.000Z	meal3837	ajmorris_	i've seen suggestions for boot-line params including all-generic-ide, irqpoll, noapic, nolapic
2007-04-12T10:46:00.000Z	meal3837	ajmorris_	none of these worked
2007-04-12T10:46:00.000Z	meal3837		whatever comes after fiesty
2007-04-12T10:47:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	what version of ubuntu are you trying to install
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	meal3837	ajmorris_	i've tried dapper (live and alt.), dapper 64, edgy and edgy 64
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	someone said this "Using 6.06 no PATA devices are found. So
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	ajmorris_		installing ubuntu is not possible if you have only a PATA hard drive.
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	ajmorris_		My SATA dvd drive is detected fine."
2007-04-12T10:48:00.000Z	meal3837	ajmorris_	figures
2007-04-12T10:50:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	have you tried feisty?
2007-04-12T10:53:00.000Z	meal3837		ajmorris_:no, i haven't . . . idk why, i have a disk sitting right here, maybe tomorrow, or later tonight.  If that doesn't work, i'll just break down and get a new drive
2007-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	apparently this problem is fixed with 2.6.18 kernel
2007-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	ajmorris_	meal3837	so feisty will prolly work
2007-04-12T10:54:00.000Z	meal3837	ajmorris_	cool
