2011-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	lumbert		How do I copy files from my Downloads folder to my flash drive?
2011-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	Why not just drag them and drop using Nautilus?
2011-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	when I tried it said I need permissions
2011-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		!ntsf | lumbert
2011-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		!ntfs | lumbert
2011-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		!ntfs-3g | lumbert
2011-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	lumbert		the partition is fat32
2011-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	Please see the last link that ubottu gave you.
2011-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	if i can view the contents of the partition, doesn't that mean its mounted already?
2011-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	i was also able to make a folder with the mkrdir command, it worked fine
2011-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	Yes, but to write to ntfs/fat32 you need either fuse or ntfs-3g.
2011-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	doesn't the ability to make a folder mean I can write?
2011-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	If the flash drive is exclusively for ubuntu, you *may* be able to reformat it to ext3 or ext4 using Gparted, but CAUTION! if you do that ALL existing data on there will be lost.
2011-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	it seems to me i can already write, i just need to go into a permissible state
2011-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	I believe that making a directory and writting files are different.
2011-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	lumbert		hmm
2011-06-10T15:18:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	It's been a while since I messed with windows partitions. :-)
2011-06-10T15:19:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	Do you get an error message when you drag/drop?
2011-06-10T15:19:00.000Z	lumbert		yep, says i need permission
2011-06-10T15:20:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		-R I think...
2011-06-10T15:20:00.000Z	lumbert		more specifically,  Error moving file Permission denied
2011-06-10T15:21:00.000Z	lumbert	Sidewinder1	my goal is to move supergrubdisk to my flash drive that currently boots ubuntu, ideally allowing me to boot to it, then that should let me repair my MBR so i can boot back into windows
2011-06-10T15:22:00.000Z	lumbert		to clarify my usb drive is fat32 and has the ubuntu 11.04 install iso
2011-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	lumbert	That's a little (flash) beyond my abilities, sorry; check this out:
