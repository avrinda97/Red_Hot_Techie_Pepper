2005-06-03T14:08:00.000Z	HappyFool		don't you mean (hd0,4) ?
2005-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool		don't the brackets go outside the hd? as in, (hd0,4), not hd(0,4)
2005-06-03T14:09:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	whoops, you're right
2005-06-03T14:11:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	his xp is on hda5
2005-06-03T14:12:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	the comment in the menu.lst shows that
2005-06-03T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	ok, and you reckon (hd0,4) maps to that ?
2005-06-03T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	the docs say '(hd0,4) specifies the first extended partition'
2005-06-03T14:13:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	mmh, i guess we should have a look at his fdisk -l shouldnt we ?
2005-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	mmh, think it should be 0,2 then if there are only 3 parts ?
2005-06-03T14:18:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	i'd think so too.. should give it a try shouldn't he ?
2005-06-03T14:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	i don't think that will change anything. according to the docs it doesn't do anything too exciting
2005-06-03T14:38:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	just read on some site that it might be needed :/
2005-06-03T14:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	ah?
2005-06-03T14:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	so much for the docs
2005-06-03T14:39:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	since there are only 3 partitions on crustys hd, do you think 0,4 is correct ?
2005-06-03T14:40:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	yea, but could it be that grub only counts the exisiting partitions ?
2005-06-03T14:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	well, not according to the docs. of course, the docs don't say anything about a 'root' without an (hd) spec and they don't specify savedefault as being necessary ;)
2005-07-11T14:33:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	what's the difference between locate and find?
2005-07-11T14:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	locate uses a daily-updated index, and is quicker
2005-10-12T12:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	maybe right-click on 'My Computer' and choose Properties?
2005-10-12T12:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	look here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q216204/
2005-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	forgetting fat32?
2005-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	othernoob	fair enough
2005-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	othernoob	HappyFool	albeit you're right, you can't write from ;)
