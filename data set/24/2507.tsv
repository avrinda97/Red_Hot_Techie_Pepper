2009-04-12T04:35:00.000Z	spanther		hi :)
2009-04-12T04:36:00.000Z	spanther		i shot my windows desktop so i used 8.10 to boot as liveCD. how to rescue the data on filesystem now? need to ship it with ftp to another pc
2009-04-12T04:37:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	you need to mount the windows partition
2009-04-12T04:37:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	which ftp server is good to upload from liveCD ?
2009-04-12T04:38:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	hmm... i don't know... how much data is it?
2009-04-12T04:38:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	like 40gb
2009-04-12T04:40:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	maybe you should check out file hosters like rapidshare
2009-04-12T04:41:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	had to do a forced mount because liveCD said the NTFS partition were in use xD
2009-04-12T04:41:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	rapidshare has a file size limit, i think. You will need to compress your stuff in partial files, but I cant tell you how to create multipart zips in ubuntu
2009-04-12T04:42:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	well uploading private data isnt that cool after all i think :)
2009-04-12T04:42:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	sounds like your windows crashed and you switched the computer off
2009-04-12T04:42:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	yeah xD exactly :)
2009-04-12T04:42:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	you can use encryped zip or something, but uploading is slow and i would rather try to get an external usb hard drive or set up a network
2009-04-12T04:43:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	network i think is the best solution :)
2009-04-12T04:43:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	if you have a LAN, then this sounds like the best option to me
2009-04-12T04:43:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	yes laptop (thinkpad r61) is connected over wifi to router and this is inside a lan
2009-04-12T04:44:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	consider creating a system partition for windows and software, and another for data, when reinstalling windows. This way you wont loose data. You could even try, if you can manage to resize your current partition, and create a data partition, save your data and resetup
2009-04-12T04:44:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	i am no friend of unclean setups :)
2009-04-12T04:45:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	there should be nothing unclean to what i meant. maybe there is a misunderstanding?
2009-04-12T04:45:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	i mean after resizing partitions and putting another partition somewhere on the harddrive :)
2009-04-12T04:46:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	ah, you mean its a risk of loosing data... well... keep in mind, that having system and data separated is very useful, when you are going to wipe that drive.
2009-04-12T04:47:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	yes. and all the time before i ever made 2 partitions too. but i made them one after another so they had the right name and order :)
2009-04-12T04:48:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	spanther	i never lost data with resizing. But it could happen, of course. I guess its not very likely. More probable is, that gparted wouldnt allow you to resize due to the unclean shutdown
2009-04-12T04:49:00.000Z	spanther	hmw_pidgin	sorry but there was no way to shutdown clean :)
