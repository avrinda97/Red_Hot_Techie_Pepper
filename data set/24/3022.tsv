2008-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	pencap	jeebusroxors	dmesg?  what log?
2008-05-22T07:37:00.000Z	jeebusroxors	pencap	dmesg would be a good start dont you think
2008-05-22T07:38:00.000Z	pencap	jeebusroxors	problem is, obviously once keyboard dies i can't type 'dmesg'
2008-05-22T07:38:00.000Z	pencap	jeebusroxors	it has to be a known bug with my chipset or something... i wonder if a kernel upgrade will patch it
2008-05-22T07:38:00.000Z	pencap	jeebusroxors	lol, i guess i could ssh from my iphone
2008-05-22T07:38:00.000Z	jeebusroxors	pencap	yea its the kernel
2008-05-22T07:39:00.000Z	pencap	jeebusroxors	how can i force a kernel upgrade?  I'm new to adept ...
2008-05-22T07:40:00.000Z	jeebusroxors	pencap	i dont use ubuntu...i come in for entertainment, and maybe help if im bored
2008-05-22T07:40:00.000Z	jeebusroxors	pencap	i would bet money its not the kernel
2008-05-22T07:41:00.000Z	jeebusroxors	pencap	if you were a good boy and read your logs youll learn a lot
