2007-02-08T13:28:00.000Z	nrot_		ok so, syslogd is running on my pc, my routers syslog feature is pointed at my pc's ip addy, so why am i not getting information from the router..?
2007-02-08T13:30:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 did you get my suggestion earlier about rebooting the router or doing something on it to cause it to trigger some syslog-relevant messages?
2007-02-08T13:31:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 ok, you got a firewall running?
2007-02-08T13:33:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 hmm .. was the firewall turned off when you rebooted the router?
2007-02-08T13:34:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 ok, could be something in your syslogd.conf probably
2007-02-08T13:35:00.000Z	nrot_	unop	any clue where to start looking, its a default install as of now
2007-02-08T13:38:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 i cant seeem to find anything in syslogd.conf either -- the next thing i would do is verify that syslogd is listening on udp port 514 and that it is indeed accessible from an external source
2007-02-08T14:12:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 what app/daemon are you referring to?
2007-02-08T14:14:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 things are peculiar in the windows world -- and i've never heard of this wallwatcher thing -- sound like "weight-watcher" or something -- outside of windows, syslog is used extensively .. and is almost 100% ubiquitous
2007-02-08T14:15:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 so it's a syslog daemon then
2007-02-08T14:18:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 so has wallwatcher had better luck with the router?
2007-02-08T14:18:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 we all have those days -- and usually its just something very small we have overlooked
2007-02-08T14:19:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 and picking everything up from the router?
2007-02-08T14:22:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 what was the last command of the router logged by syslog -- there might be indication of why logs are now suspended
2007-02-08T14:25:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 one another thing we havent really ruled out -- are you sure the messages arent being logged in any other of the files under /var/log ?
2007-02-08T14:31:00.000Z	nrot_	unop	what was the command to grep all files in a folder ?
2007-02-08T14:31:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 sudo grep -inHR 'keyword' /path/to/folder/*
2007-02-08T14:32:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 i also found this -- check the second section about network aware syslog - http://www.aboutdebian.com/syslog.htm
2007-02-08T14:41:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 it's likely that syslog is filtering messages out because they dont meet a severity level -- you might want an entry in your syslogd.conf thats trapping _everything_
2007-02-08T14:43:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 and is that the logfile you are seeing that last message from half an hour ago?
2007-02-08T14:44:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 did you see that section about adding the extra options in /etc/init.d/sysklogd ?
2007-02-08T14:45:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 were those entries already there? or did you have to add them in now?
2007-02-08T14:46:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 ok, was syslogd restarted? (just making sure)
2007-02-08T14:48:00.000Z	unop	nrot_	 have you triggered any activity since?
