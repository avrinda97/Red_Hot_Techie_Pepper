2009-09-13T11:27:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	type kill + the pid number for the app that you want to kill
2009-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	is it run as root/
2009-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	who is the owner?
2009-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	are you trying to kill a frozen app?
2009-09-13T11:30:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	are you using gnome?
2009-09-13T11:31:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	if you are there is a panel app called force quit try that
2009-09-13T11:32:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	that is the window manager or desktop manager
2009-09-13T11:34:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	if you are usinga stock ubuntu use the force quit panel button
2009-09-13T11:35:00.000Z	roccity_	deejaydblock	just right click on the panel and choose force quit
