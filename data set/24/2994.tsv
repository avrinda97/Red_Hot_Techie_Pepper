2008-05-30T20:24:00.000Z	WizardFait		In my past... I've gotten it to work, but then it'll randomly disconnect, then reconnect...
2008-05-30T20:24:00.000Z	WizardFait		But that's only if I'm lucky.
2008-05-30T20:24:00.000Z	WizardFait		infamous as...? Being horrible with linux? ;P
2008-05-30T20:25:00.000Z	WizardFait		Or does bcm43xx actually make it work?
2008-05-30T20:26:00.000Z	WizardFait		Okay, so... If I use the instructions (On 8.04) to go to linuxwireless.org (or w/e it was) and it does what I described, what do I do to fix it?
2008-05-30T20:26:00.000Z	WizardFait		I've gotten it to work in the past, but then it is so shoddy.
2008-05-30T20:26:00.000Z	WizardFait		And HORRIBLE speeds!
2008-05-30T20:26:00.000Z	WizardFait		and I've found, if I use iwconfig to up the bit-rate, the connection becomes impossibly unstable.
2008-05-30T20:28:00.000Z	WizardFait		Anyone have a solution?
2008-05-30T20:29:00.000Z	WizardFait		Revilodraw: Hopefully, for you, it's not like my laptop, where it's software-driven. I found if I disabled my wireless card in windows, ubuntu would never turn the light on...
2008-05-30T20:30:00.000Z	revilodraw	WizardFait	hmm i dont dual boot
2008-05-30T20:31:00.000Z	WizardFait	revilodraw	Was the wireless light enabled BEFORE you installed ubuntu?
2008-05-30T20:31:00.000Z	revilodraw	WizardFait	ive had ubuntu for ages and it showed, it just stopped showing since hardy..
2008-05-30T20:31:00.000Z	WizardFait		Ah.
2008-05-30T20:31:00.000Z	WizardFait	revilodraw	Then I don't know. Sorry. :D
2008-05-30T20:32:00.000Z	revilodraw	WizardFait	lol it's not a big deal
2008-05-30T20:33:00.000Z	WizardFait	revilodraw	Yeah... I'm here for some wireless help as well.
2008-05-30T20:33:00.000Z	WizardFait		I have a broadcom 54G card, I can get it to work... Kind of... If I use the linuxwireless.org instructions.
2008-05-30T20:33:00.000Z	WizardFait		But then my speed is horrible, and the connection likes to just drop...
2008-05-30T20:34:00.000Z	WizardFait		and if I boost the speed, it gets more unreliable.
2008-05-30T20:34:00.000Z	WizardFait		Oh, and it REALLY doesn't like wep keys...
2008-05-30T20:34:00.000Z	WizardFait		It'll make me reconnect at least 3 times before it stays connected.
2008-05-30T20:34:00.000Z	WizardFait		Then once it does, as soon as it drops the connection... It asks me for the key, AGAIN!
2008-05-30T20:34:00.000Z	revilodraw	WizardFait	hmmm reinstall the drivers?
