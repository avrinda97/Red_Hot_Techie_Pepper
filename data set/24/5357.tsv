2006-08-09T13:03:00.000Z	syke		and removed the references from /var/apt/*
2006-08-09T13:03:00.000Z	syke		it seems like I need to downgrade libc or something
2006-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	syke		I just can't find any infoz on this virtual package and how it works
2006-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	syke		yes
2006-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	syke		guh. if I reinstall, it's back to gentoo
2006-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	syke		how would I downgrade libc6?
2006-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	syke		I'm a little confused by the fact that it says 6.3.x rather than 2.3.x or 2.4.x
2006-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	excitatory	syke	what kind of reasoning is that?  ubuntu takes less than 15 minutes to re-install..
2006-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	syke	excitatory	it has a packaging system I can comprehend and get help with
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		I just need to know what i need to do to satisfy this dependency: libapt-pkg-libc6.3-6-3.11
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	excitatory	syke	well, what's your question..  i'm well versed in debian, gentoo, and ubuntu..
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		I have manually re-installed apt, dpkg, etc, etc with manual downloads and dpkg -i
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		still no dice
2006-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	syke		libc6 seems like the next step, but I wanted to make sure first
2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	excitatory	syke	why did you reinstall those packages?
2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	syke		flannel: synaptic and adept, both
2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	syke		exictatory: in an attempt to satisfy the dependency
2006-08-09T13:10:00.000Z	syke		which is 'virtual'
2006-08-09T13:11:00.000Z	syke		flannel: there are updates, apparantly
2006-08-09T13:11:00.000Z	syke		so
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	syke		in the sources.list?
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	syke		I do believe so
2006-08-09T13:12:00.000Z	excitatory	syke	please call out my name.. it's hard to see your text in the channel.. also, i havn't been following your problem.. and so everything you've told me thus far is vague and incomplete.
2006-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	syke	excitatory	ok, sorry
