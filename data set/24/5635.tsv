2007-04-20T07:20:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	i am on edgy
2007-04-20T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 I don'T know why you don'T have it , sorry

2007-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 are those hdd mounted ?
2007-07-30T05:16:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	a bunch of hdd's that are mounted in dmraid keep showing up
2007-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 ah and you want them to disappear ? I donT' think you can
2007-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	above the line that separates the favorites
2007-07-30T05:17:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	welo the os thinks they arent mounted but they really are just in dmraid
2007-07-30T05:18:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	this never happened to me in 6.10
2007-07-30T05:18:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 will unmounting them keep you from using them in dmraid ?  remove them from fstab and they won't automount
2007-07-30T05:19:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	they are showing up because they aren't mounted
2007-07-30T05:19:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	I don't have entries for them in the fstab
2007-07-30T05:19:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 nothing umounted should show up in nautilus
2007-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	 I donT' know then ,  sorry,  try looking in the forum
2007-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	nick_	Pelo	when I right click it gives me the option to mount them
2007-07-30T05:20:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	I still don'T know sorry
2007-07-30T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	nick_	have a look in  gconf-editor,   /apps/nautilus/..... see if there is something there that can help
