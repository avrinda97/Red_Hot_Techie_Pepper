2011-04-13T22:25:00.000Z	bloops		can anyone tell me how to install g++ 4.6? there are some dependency errors when I try to install from the 'ubuntu-toolchain-r' repository
2011-04-13T22:26:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	oooh, they have a ppa/repo? can i have a link to that?
2011-04-13T22:26:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/
2011-04-13T22:28:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	but their gcc is soooo old...
2011-04-13T22:28:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	scratch i was looking at wrong row :P
2011-04-13T22:29:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	no, i was right. the maverick version more than 3 months old
2011-04-13T22:30:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	and failed to compile
2011-04-13T22:30:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	yes, but its still 4.6, where does it say failed to compile?
2011-04-13T22:31:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/test/+packages and expand the gcc-4.6 / maverick entry
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	I'd rather host my own - of which i was thinking either way
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	hmm I see.
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	unless i'd switch to natty. or fedora :P
2011-04-13T22:32:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	oh have you built gcc 4.6?
2011-04-13T22:33:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	not yet; i was thinking of it, because i didn't know there were packages with it
2011-04-13T22:34:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	but since i want to switch to natty soon and they have (seemingly) working versions for natty, i might not have to
2011-04-13T22:34:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	hmm, is there any option to get gcc 4.6 in maverick other than compiling it from source?
2011-04-13T22:35:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	which isn't going to be a piece of cake i guess
2011-04-13T22:36:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	no idea. but compiling from source isn't too bad
2011-04-13T22:36:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	then you just do a 'sudo checkinstall' instead of 'sudo make install' and you get nice little .deb :)
2011-04-13T22:37:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	but considering how 'high-profile' gcc is, they might provide *proper* debian buld-pkg info that will get you semi-official build
2011-04-13T22:38:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	hmm, I am going to try what you and acicula said
2011-04-13T22:38:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	now? if so, i might stick around a bit more and if not, then i'm out of here
2011-04-13T22:39:00.000Z	bloops	janisozaur	yes I'm trying now. thanks a lot if you decide to stick around :)
2011-04-13T22:39:00.000Z	janisozaur	bloops	then /msg me
