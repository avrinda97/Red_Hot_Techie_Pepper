2009-07-20T12:12:00.000Z	Tengu		hello world
2009-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	Tengu		question : using jaunty (up-to-date), is there a way to drag a window to another desktop? (i.e. I click on window's title bar, drag it to the right, and when it reaches the edge, hop, it goes to the next desktop on the right)
2009-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	Tengu		I use a standard ubuntu with gnome.
2009-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	Doesn't it do that automatically?
2009-07-20T12:13:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	nope :(
2009-07-20T12:14:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	If you use Compiz, the compizconfig-settings-manager app can edit pretty much all settings.
2009-07-20T12:14:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	I prefere not to use it....
2009-07-20T12:15:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	You don't have to use any effects.
2009-07-20T12:15:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	mmm. will give it a try. which package do I have to install to set compiz behaviour ?
2009-07-20T12:15:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	I just told you - compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-07-20T12:15:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	thanks.
2009-07-20T12:16:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	Btw, offtopic: If you want, you can use Xfce's xfwm on GNOME.
2009-07-20T12:20:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	oh yeah. I didn't thought about it.
2009-07-20T12:28:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	do you have a link on how to change gnome default WM ?
2009-07-20T12:28:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	Just enable "desktop effects" in the Appearance settings, it'll automatically enable Compiz.
2009-07-20T12:28:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	don't want compiz in fact.....
2009-07-20T12:28:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	Why not?
2009-07-20T12:29:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	Compiz has virtual desktops too
2009-07-20T12:29:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	yeah.... I know. but broken here, and all those effects, addons, plugins... even if I stop them all, it's heavier.
2009-07-20T12:30:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	In gconf-editor, it's /desktop/gnome/session/required_components
2009-07-20T12:32:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	thanks. done.... let's give it a try.
2009-07-20T12:32:00.000Z	grawity	Tengu	But if you change it to xfwm4, you will probably need to create a new file in /usr/share/applications/xfwm4.desktop -- mine is http://sprunge.us/UWZN
2009-07-20T12:46:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	oh, thanks.
2009-07-20T12:48:00.000Z	Tengu	grawity	ah, yeah, that works fine. thank you!
