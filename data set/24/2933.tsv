2008-06-19T23:35:00.000Z	jcolbert		i want ppl to make changes, i just want t away to revert changes back
2008-06-19T23:36:00.000Z	jcolbert		some graphic cards don't work properly
2008-06-19T23:36:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	there's partition magic, but I haven't tried ubuntu's package of it.
2008-06-19T23:37:00.000Z	jcolbert	jimcooncat	would that prevent changes from being saved
2008-06-19T23:38:00.000Z	jcolbert		I found some third party software called Deep Freeze, but it says it's for SUSE
2008-06-19T23:38:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	no, it would back up the partition. You could restore it later to go back.
2008-06-19T23:43:00.000Z	jcolbert	jimcooncat	:-\ that sounds more complex, this is a computer lab and they have classes all day long and it would be easier to have it revert back to a default image automatically after every reboot kinda like Deep Freeze (by farconics) and Microsoft's Steady State
2008-06-19T23:44:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	oh, then a more simple fix if you don't want to retain the student's information would be with lvm
2008-06-19T23:44:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	you'd make a snapshot, then mount the snapshot rw
2008-06-19T23:45:00.000Z	jcolbert		wow... that sounds like what I want jimcooncat
2008-06-19T23:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	have logout destroy the snapshot, optionally backing up portions of it first
2008-06-19T23:45:00.000Z	jcolbert		that sounds good
2008-06-19T23:46:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	downside to this is they'll lose their work on a power outage
2008-06-19T23:46:00.000Z	jcolbert		that's fine...
2008-06-19T23:46:00.000Z	jcolbert		they generally save to Flash drive anyways
2008-06-19T23:49:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	it's a bit of a pain to set up, but once you do you won't have to mess with it, and it's fast fast
2008-06-19T23:49:00.000Z	jcolbert		:-\
2008-06-19T23:49:00.000Z	jcolbert		does ubuntu have directions for setting something like this up jimcooncat
2008-06-19T23:53:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	I don't see any ubuntu docs that do what I'm describing here :-(
2008-06-19T23:53:00.000Z	jcolbert		ah
2008-06-19T23:54:00.000Z	jcolbert		:-\... i was thinking that an option would be to setup a server that holds the boot image have all the computers boot from that image. Then have the server configured to automatically recreate the boot image every day
2008-06-19T23:54:00.000Z	jcolbert		maybe by pulling it from  another server
2008-06-19T23:55:00.000Z	jcolbert		do you think something like that would work jimcooncat
2008-06-19T23:56:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jcolbert	yes, I do. You'd want to look for documentation on mounting lvm read-write snapshots -- not backup.
