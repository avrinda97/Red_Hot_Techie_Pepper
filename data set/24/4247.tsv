2007-07-13T06:31:00.000Z	mroc		i don't mean to sound impatient, but if someone can at least point me in the right direction, i'd appreciate it:  i'm getting some strange display glitches (which seem to happen at random).  where should i be looking for errors / anything specific to look for?
2007-07-13T06:31:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	what kind of glitches
2007-07-13T06:33:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	strange blank spaces in the screens (login and at the desktop), display won't refesh until i move the mouse over parts
2007-07-13T06:33:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	are you running any compositing software like beryl, compiz, desktop-effects etc?
2007-07-13T06:34:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	yes, compiz with plenty of the unstable plugins and such, but i don't have those set to run at startup.  i launch manually when i want cool stuff.  the problem is happening when i'm not running compositing stuff
2007-07-13T06:35:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	type this at the command prompt: "metacity --replace &" and tell me if anything happens
2007-07-13T06:36:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	it's an old (5 years now) laptop and one of my first thoughts was that maybe the video ram is starting to go, but i have no idea how to determine that.               ok.  will do
2007-07-13T06:37:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	well, the cool compositing stuff went away (of course), and the output is [1]  8622
2007-07-13T06:38:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	what video card are you using?
2007-07-13T06:39:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	 nvidia geforce 4 440 Go
2007-07-13T06:39:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	when did this problem start?  what did you do just before that
2007-07-13T06:40:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	that's the problem...it seemed to begin at random, and it happens at random.  i'm not changing my xorg.conf at all and it'll happen occasionally, other times it'll be fine.
2007-07-13T06:40:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	did it happen first when you installed ubuntu?
2007-07-13T06:43:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	probably began a couple weeks after a clean install of feisty.  i had dapper, upgraded to edgy, upgraded to early then final feisty.  it began on fiesty, and i did a clean install.  began happening again within a week or two of clean install.
2007-07-13T06:43:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	ignore my first sentence there...it makes no sense with the rest of the comment.
2007-07-13T06:43:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	could be a bug in feisty
2007-07-13T06:45:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	i guess, but where would this kind of error get reported?  in a logfile somewhere?    the age of the laptop made me think it was video ram dying, but i'd be much happier to find out it's a bug.
2007-07-13T06:45:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	if its a bug its not necessarily returning error messages at all
2007-07-13T06:46:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	ah, point taken.  anything i can do from here?  i don't know how to repeat it, and it seems way too vague to report as any kind of bug.
2007-07-13T06:47:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	i have no idea.  you can possibly fix it by removing your video drivers :P but who wants to do that
2007-07-13T06:47:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	when it starts occurring, try that metacity --replace & command, and see if that helps
2007-07-13T06:49:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	ok, thanks for your input, esp. since you seem busy with many conversations.  i might try asking around again later, see if someone else has some other ideas.      thanks again.
2007-07-13T06:49:00.000Z	shiester_miester	mroc	unfortunately i have no idea of how to fix your problem
2007-07-13T06:51:00.000Z	mroc	shiester_miester	yeah...me neither.  it's a tough one to describe and probably much harder to troubleshoot.  i appreciate the help though.  i'll try the metacity thing next time it happens, see what comes up.
