2008-06-22T07:39:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	That's still not a very good description.  Please ask a *full* question, all on one line.
2008-06-22T07:40:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	Have you followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows ?
2008-06-22T07:41:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	Again, Stop using the enter key as punctuation.  So, you want to boot windows with GRUB, but you have no linux on it?
2008-06-22T07:41:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	Again, these are things you should be including in your original question.  You're currently making it *extremely* difficult to help you, which is why you haven't been helped yet.
2008-06-22T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	How many harddrives do you have in this computer?
2008-06-22T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	Does your BIOS allow you to boot to USB?
2008-06-22T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	so, you install GRUB to the USB one, and then in the BIOS, select that disk to boot to.
2008-06-22T07:43:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	You *cant* install grub on the internal one, without overwriting the windows bootloader.  theres only one MBR
2008-06-22T07:43:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	Is this a fresh install of Ubuntu on the USB drive?
2008-06-22T07:44:00.000Z	Flannel	georgij	please stop repeating the same question.  You're being helped. Stop asking the same thing again and again.
