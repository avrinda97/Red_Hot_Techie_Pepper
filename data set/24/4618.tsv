2007-03-09T12:29:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: do you have the red diamond in your notification tray?
2007-03-09T12:29:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	yup
2007-03-09T12:30:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: right-click on it and select "Emerald Theme Manager".  As you click on different themes, the appearance on your screen will change automatically.
2007-03-09T12:31:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: open a terminal and type "emerald --replace".
2007-03-09T12:31:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: be sure that beryl is actually running as well.  type "beryl" in the terminal.
2007-03-09T12:33:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	i typed emerald --replace and the terminal is just sitting there doing nothing
2007-03-09T12:33:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: it's not supposed to do much.  did you type "beryl" as well?
2007-03-09T12:34:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: open /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-03-09T12:35:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	yup
2007-03-09T12:35:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: i'm curious.  did you follow the howto at ubuntuforums.org.
2007-03-09T12:36:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	do i need to be logged in as xgi?
2007-03-09T12:37:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	i did the wiki hotwo
2007-03-09T12:37:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: you need to have that program running.  I think that you need to uninstall and then go to ubuntuforums.org and follow this howto step by step.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263851
2007-03-09T12:39:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	do i need to uninstall my nvidia drivers?
2007-03-09T12:40:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: I don't think so.  That's not mentined anywhere in the howto.  Just uninstall beryl.  do it through synaptic and do completely remove.
2007-03-09T12:41:00.000Z	omeil_	billy	but thats how i installed beryl
2007-03-09T12:42:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: Yes it is.  Syn*APT*ic is just the GUI front-end for the apt-get command.
2007-03-09T12:43:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: you really need to carefully follow the howto in that link that I gave you.  don't worry about uninstalling beryl.  Just go to that link and follow the howto.
2007-03-09T12:45:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: did you catch that?  be sure you're using the beryl repositories listed in that howto.
2007-03-09T12:46:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: ok man.  i think you're on the right track.  i don't use nvidia.  i use intel.  so there's only so far I can help you.
2007-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	billy	omeil_	: you're having a compositing problem.
