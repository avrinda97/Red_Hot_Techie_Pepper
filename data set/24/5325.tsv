2006-10-10T11:43:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	then i suggest that you have a look around and find the real .core file ;)
2006-10-10T11:35:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	what is this file "BST?"
2006-10-10T11:36:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	it's an executable that I compiled to implement a binary search tree
2006-10-10T11:36:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	and when you actually execute it ... ?
2006-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	it seg faults and core dumps
2006-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	so I want to use gdb to debug it
2006-10-10T11:37:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	well, the executable itself is not a .core logfile of the dump.
2006-10-10T11:38:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	sudo updatedb && locate .core
2006-10-10T11:38:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	it put the core file in the folder that I executed from, and it is called "core"
2006-10-10T11:39:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	run gdb against that file
2006-10-10T11:39:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	just that file?: gdb core?
2006-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	gdb requires an executable
2006-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	sure, unless you need to add arguments
2006-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	no, no arguments
2006-10-10T11:40:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	this is the web page I was looking at, where I got the idea: http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/segfaults.html
2006-10-10T11:42:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	I ran gdp -c ./core and it still said "./core is not a core dump: File format not recognized"
2006-10-10T11:42:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	er, gdb - not gdp
2006-10-10T11:46:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	I ran 'sudo updatedb && locate .core' and it didn't find a core file
2006-10-10T11:47:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	then you need to figure out where the .core files are getting placed when your app segfaults.
2006-10-10T11:47:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	to get the core file to appear in the first place, I had to run 'ulimit -c unlimited', so I'm pretty confident that is the core file
2006-10-10T11:47:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	you may find that the IRC channel(s), web forums, mailing lists (or whatever) for that piece of code are of more help.
2006-10-10T11:47:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	and it reappears if I delete it and run my program again
2006-10-10T11:48:00.000Z	mnepton	ScurveyFrog	then it is not in a format gdb expects
2006-10-10T11:48:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog	mnepton	okay
