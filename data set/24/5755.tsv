2011-06-10T02:29:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	I actually think Psydoll's question is relevant as I've faced this issue before and it is OS related
2011-06-10T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	I didn't say it wasn't a relevant question, I'm stating that nothing you change in ubuntu will change in the windows OS, I'm answering the relevant question
2011-06-10T02:29:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	it does :)
2011-06-10T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	no, it doesn't.
2011-06-10T02:30:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	I'm just mentionning I've faced the same type of problem before, even though I understand both OSes to be indepedant
2011-06-10T02:30:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	Psydoll: when I encountered a similar issue, it was a problem with the driver
2011-06-10T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	yes, I appreciate what you've said, but as I said to Psydoll that is nothing to do with the OS - if you disable hardware, that's a physical change, nothing to do with the OS
2011-06-10T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	the linux and windows operating systems do not interact in anyway, so will not effect the "drivers"
2011-06-10T02:32:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	I am not trying to argue and I really know what you're trying to explain and am full aware of how an OS works, but I've had a wireless driver issue on Linux that caused issues in Windows...  after updating it the problem was resolved
2011-06-10T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	you are incorrect
2011-06-10T02:32:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	that is fact
2011-06-10T02:32:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	sure sure sure
2011-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	why do you argue with 2 experts stating facts?
2011-06-10T02:34:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	are you an expert ?
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	then why are you comparing a hardware state change to an OS issue
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	forget it, you don't want to undertand
2011-06-10T02:35:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	I understand quite clearlyh
2011-06-10T02:37:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	the drivers are obviously not shared and it does in fact affect the hardware status, but a bad driver can have a bad effect on the hardware status
2011-06-10T02:37:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	correct, no argument there
2011-06-11T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	linux software raid is fully supported by the ubuntu community
2011-06-11T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	fake raid is not supported and unstable, linux software raid is supported
2011-06-11T00:47:00.000Z	julie	ikonia	what is fake raid if it<s not software raid?
2011-06-11T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	it's the motherboard on raid devices that require a software layer
2011-06-11T00:48:00.000Z	ikonia	julie	as opposed to software raid that is part of the linux kernel
