2009-04-05T08:25:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	can't find out now.... now obex won't even work
2009-04-05T08:25:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	i get different errors based on how i try to send the file
2009-04-05T08:26:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	Operation not supported by backend
2009-04-05T08:26:00.000Z	mattgyver83	meoblast001	Are you positive that the phone can send files, or does it only use Bluetooth to make connections to other devices like headsets and such.
2009-04-05T08:27:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	100% possitive
2009-04-05T08:27:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	that's what FTP stands for
2009-04-05T08:27:00.000Z	mattgyver83	meoblast001	im using a G1, i can make a connection, however android doesnt currently support file transfers over bluetooth but my Palm Lifedrive did (its a treo -the phone)
2009-04-05T08:27:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	i googled online... Windows users seem to have no problem sending and receiving files
2009-04-05T08:30:00.000Z	mattgyver83	meoblast001	I dont really have a good answer for you.  If it makes a connection then it should transfer files.  My lifedrive worked as soon as a  I setup obex.
2009-04-05T08:30:00.000Z	meoblast001	mattgyver83	Ubuntu hatse me
2009-04-05T08:34:00.000Z	mattgyver83	meoblast001	is gnome-obex-server what your using? (dont know if you caught my earlier post)
