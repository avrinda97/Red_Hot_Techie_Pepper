2007-08-26T09:06:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	make sure it's unmuted and turned up in the sound menu (right click on the speaker icon)
2007-08-26T09:07:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: no problem with sound, only nobody hears me
2007-08-26T09:07:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	you can adjust your mic input there as well, most like it's off and muted you can change it by right clicking on the speaker and clicking on open volume controls
2007-08-26T09:08:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: Thank you
2007-08-26T09:08:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: i gonna check
2007-08-26T09:13:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	Does not work, en it not dempped
2007-08-26T09:15:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	are you sure the microfphone is in the right slot?
2007-08-26T09:16:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	what program are you using to record sound?
2007-08-26T09:16:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: teamspeak2
2007-08-26T09:17:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	teamspeak is a crappy program
2007-08-26T09:17:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: I have no choice :
2007-08-26T09:17:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	shutdown all audio programs if they are open
2007-08-26T09:17:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	done
2007-08-26T09:19:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	: it's done
2007-08-26T09:19:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	try teamspeak now
2007-08-26T09:22:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	does not work
2007-08-26T09:24:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	hit Alt-F2 and enter killall esd in the command line
2007-08-26T09:28:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	they hear me better but still too low\
2007-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	in a console type alsamixer, move around with the arrow keys and adjust with up down keys, look for a setting called mic DB boost or something similar, you can toggle it with the m key
2007-08-26T09:32:00.000Z	polopolo	rexy_	thank you, you saved me from starting more windows xp
2007-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	rexy_	polopolo	yw, make sure to not run any audio programs when using teamspeak, ussually the esd sound daemon auto releases the sound card so teamspeak can use it
