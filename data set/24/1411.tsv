2010-01-27T21:48:00.000Z	Pici	sayres561	What are you putting into your crontab?

2010-01-27T21:53:00.000Z	Pici	sayres561	you need to use crontab -e to modify your user's crontab, you cannot use just any editor.

2010-01-27T21:54:00.000Z	Pici	sayres561	then save
2010-01-27T21:55:00.000Z	Pici	sayres561	You need to type in the editor that 'crontab -e' opens
