2007-12-31T21:35:00.000Z	methods		how do i configure compiz ?
2007-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	join #compiz-fusion
2007-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	yea but what does ubuntu come with to configure it ? it should have something by default
2007-12-31T21:37:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	like where is hte fusion manager and stuff
2007-12-31T21:37:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	other than gnome-appearance-properties and gconf-editor, nothing :)
2007-12-31T21:37:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	yes it does
2007-12-31T21:38:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	there's no way ccsm would ever be included by default. it's far too complex and dangerous
2007-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	you mean a settings manager? that's ccsm
2007-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	you remember the beryl icon ?
2007-12-31T21:40:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	there's fusion-icon but you really don't need it on ubuntu. join #compiz-fusion if you really want to install it
2007-12-31T21:56:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	is gldesktop a compliment or what ?
2007-12-31T21:57:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	gl desktop (gnome-compiz-manager) is an outdated configurator for compiz
2007-12-31T21:57:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	it's pretty much useless
2007-12-31T22:13:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	ever since fusion i havn't been able to use the showe desktop plugin :[ it doesn't work when i move my mouse to the right top corner
2007-12-31T22:13:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	the "Show Desktop" plugin is just an effect, go to General Options and set the edge binding for "Hide all windows and focus desktop"
2007-12-31T22:15:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	the package is compizcofig-settings-manager and the menu item is Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
2007-12-31T22:22:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	where do you see edge binding ?
2007-12-31T22:23:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	double click on the row and a dialog will pop up where you can check TopRight
2007-12-31T22:23:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	row ?
2007-12-31T22:24:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	did you find General Options > Bindings yet?
2007-12-31T22:24:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	 no thats what i mean im looking everhwere in options
2007-12-31T22:24:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	it's the last tab of General Options
2007-12-31T22:26:00.000Z	methods	crdlb	am i out dated or somtehing ? ill show you a screen shot if you want
2007-12-31T22:33:00.000Z	crdlb	methods	sorry I'm just using a different version of compiz fusion and I forgot the name of that tab in the old version :)
