2005-12-23T10:07:00.000Z	uscfan		can anyone hear me as in, can anyone read my messages
2005-12-23T10:07:00.000Z	uscfan		this is strange because my name is greyed out in xchat and no one but you seems to be hearing me
2005-12-23T10:08:00.000Z	uscfan		jeez ok thanks, i thought i was going insane
2005-12-23T10:08:00.000Z	intelikey	uscfan	there may be a way to manuelly set the hd in the bios have you checked for that ?
2005-12-23T10:08:00.000Z	uscfan		i have tried, my bios doesnt detect the hd at all
2005-12-23T10:09:00.000Z	uscfan		which is wierd, because ubuntu and winxp install to it, and i can read and edit data on it from ubuntu live right now
2005-12-23T10:09:00.000Z	intelikey	uscfan	not an autodetect.  manual setup for the hd ?
2005-12-23T10:09:00.000Z	intelikey		not sure what bios you have.....
2005-12-23T10:09:00.000Z	uscfan		the bios doesnt detect it, and therefore doesnt initiate boot to hte drive
2005-12-23T10:11:00.000Z	uscfan		F2 is bios, and within the bios i cant do anything to help the situation
2005-12-23T10:11:00.000Z	uscfan		imma just download smartbootmanager and try and see what i can do with that
2005-12-23T10:11:00.000Z	intelikey	uscfan	have you entered the bios setup on that lappy before ?
2005-12-23T10:12:00.000Z	uscfan		i got another question though, how difficult would it be to get my wireless card (onboard) working within ubuntu. Its some broadcom chipset
2005-12-23T10:12:00.000Z	intelikey		ok at least you have tried to set it up mannually uscfan
2005-12-23T10:12:00.000Z	intelikey		and pardon my lag time.
2005-12-23T10:13:00.000Z	uscfan	intelikey	my bios will not let me manually configure the hard drive. IT doesnt even detect it at all so I cant
2005-12-23T10:15:00.000Z	intelikey	uscfan	yes. ok.  some bios's have options....  some don't.      uscfan maybe remove the drive turn power on let it try to boot power off and insert the drive.   that might 'jog' the bios into noticing it.
