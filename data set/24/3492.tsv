2009-10-27T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	run: ps -ef | grep -i fire
2009-10-27T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	make sure ALL firefoxes are killed
2009-10-27T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	in terminal
2009-10-27T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	yes, thats why i gave it like that
2009-10-27T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	you need to kill all firefoxes or you will always get the update message
2009-10-27T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	just type it then
2009-10-27T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	ps -ef | grep fire
2009-10-27T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	use the mouse to right click ->  copy
2009-10-27T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	then just type it, the line in the middle is a pipe]
2009-10-27T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	thats what ps outputs, you used grep to make the output smarter
2009-10-27T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	the leftmost value is the pid, you use the kill command to kill the pid
2009-10-27T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	a reboot may help
2009-10-27T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	the command is:    ps -ef | grep fire
2009-10-27T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	depends on your keyboard and layout
2009-10-27T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	its a PIPE not a pipel
2009-10-27T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erikk71	depends on your country, it varys wildly
