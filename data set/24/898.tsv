2011-05-09T23:09:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	what's your issue with ssh?
2011-05-09T23:09:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	see above  this :)
2011-05-09T23:09:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	do you get an error?
2011-05-09T23:09:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	can you telnet port 22 on the ubuntu box?
2011-05-09T23:10:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	I get could not resolve hostname 192.168.2.100:22 Name or service not known
2011-05-09T23:11:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	telnet 192.168.2.100 22
2011-05-09T23:11:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	not :22
2011-05-09T23:12:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	I get this Escape character is '^]'. then SSH-2.0-OpenSSH 5.8pl Debian-lubuntu3
2011-05-09T23:13:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	good, that means it's working and it's putty's fault
2011-05-09T23:13:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	can you manually connect with putty?
2011-05-09T23:13:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	yes with a ppk file
2011-05-09T23:13:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	I can now ssh realizing that I needed to do -p port as mine is not on port 22
2011-05-09T23:14:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	but for secure reasons I didnt mention that :)
2011-05-09T23:14:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	I get Permision denied (publickey)
2011-05-09T23:14:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	lol, telling me your port number is not going to make you less secure. esp if you're using key auth only
2011-05-09T23:15:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	ahh lol :) ok just being safe
2011-05-09T23:15:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	assuming you have your keys all set up already and your SSH configured to accept them, you need to bring them into putty
2011-05-09T23:15:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	not that I dont trust others but youknow :)
2011-05-09T23:15:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	umm I have the keys all setup on the server just not on this new install of ubuntu
2011-05-09T23:16:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	when I run putty and add the key it works fine but how do I add the key to openssh
2011-05-09T23:16:00.000Z	tehnef	crash1hd	you just need to add it to your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
2011-05-09T23:16:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	as a ppk file?
2011-05-09T23:19:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	I added the ppk file to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys but I still get permision denied (public key)
2011-05-09T23:27:00.000Z	crash1hd	tehnef	you still around?
