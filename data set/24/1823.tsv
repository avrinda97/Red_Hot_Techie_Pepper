2009-08-04T19:03:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	please pastebin (see pastebin.com) your /boot/grub/grub.lst
2009-08-04T19:05:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	copy the contents of the file i told you into that site and post the url of the page it sends you to after you submit
2009-08-04T19:10:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	are you pasting /boot/grub/grub.lst like I asked?
2009-08-04T19:12:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	yes.  open the file and copy all of the text, then go to pastebin.com and paste it into the large text box.  press send.  then copy the url from your address bar into the chat
2009-08-04T19:15:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	the LARGE textbox ABOVE "Your Name"
2009-08-04T19:16:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	click "Send"
2009-08-04T19:17:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	now copy the url from your address bar into this chat
2009-08-04T19:19:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	i told you to OPEN the file and copy the CONTENTS, not the filename!
2009-08-04T19:19:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	If i wasn't the one trying to help, this would be unny, but it's frustrating for me
2009-08-04T19:23:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	if you don't have /boot/grub/grub.lst then what's in your /boot directory?
2009-08-04T19:27:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	there should be a bar on the top of your screen that says "Places"
2009-08-04T19:28:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	open menu.lst
2009-08-04T19:30:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	if there is no menu.lst, then you did not boot into ubuntu, or anything else for that matter
2009-08-04T19:30:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	copy it to pastebin
2009-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	do you also have another windows version installed?
2009-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	have you ever?
2009-08-04T19:36:00.000Z	grep-grail	nick1452158	it's a dell, isn't it?
