2007-01-24T08:57:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	are you using Dapper?
2007-01-24T08:58:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	are you using Dapper?
2007-01-24T08:59:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	when you installed Ubuntu, did you install the Dapper Drake or Edgy Eft version? If it came with 1.5, then it's Dapper
2007-01-24T09:00:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	that's breezy
2007-01-24T09:00:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	i'm looking for some packages
2007-01-24T09:02:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	that won't work anyway
2007-01-24T09:02:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	2.0 isn't available through official sources for your version of Ubuntu
2007-01-24T09:03:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	you can try the package files for a later version of Ubuntu
2007-01-24T09:03:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	Mozilla offers a tar.gz download with an install script. You can try that
2007-01-24T09:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	hold on a sec
2007-01-24T09:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	for amsn, we're going to open a terminal
2007-01-24T09:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	open a terminal and use this command:
2007-01-24T09:05:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	"sudo aptitude install amsn"
2007-01-24T09:06:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	is it done?
2007-01-24T09:06:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	see if amsn is installed...
2007-01-24T09:15:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	what doesn't work, and how doesn't it work?
2007-01-24T09:15:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	how did it get to the desktop? Did you type the command?
2007-01-24T09:16:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	did you put the command I gave you into the terminal?
2007-01-24T09:17:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	you shouldn't have a package file
2007-01-24T09:17:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	the command I gave you
2007-01-24T09:18:00.000Z	cablesm102	ulu	you need to type "sudo aptitude install amsn" into the terminal, then answer all the questions. If that didn't work, your APT is messed up.
