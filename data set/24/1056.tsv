2010-08-12T23:34:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi		I want to dual boot my computer. I have windows on a 40G IDE drive sda - I have a new 2T drive sdb that I want to be my main drive. I want to be able to run the machine with the windows drive physically off the computer.
2010-08-12T23:34:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi		Weisshund, I have run the integrity test on the 10.04 liveCD twice. Yes it's on this computer but that should be good enough, right?
2010-08-12T23:35:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	how is ubuntu a problem?
2010-08-12T23:36:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	would you like to transfer the OS in your 40 gig HD to your 2T HD?
2010-08-13T00:04:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	(lag cause I got a phone call)  Re the XP on the 40G. No I dont want to transfer it. I have just installed it. This is a Dell so I have legal Windows. I can use it for my webcam (that wont work in Ubuntu), for Photoshop, for Windows-games that come on movie-DVDs which I have never gotten a chance to try, other things that do not work on linux. So I want to have a Windows option, but keep it to its own HD. Especially since
2010-08-13T00:04:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	What is my problem? I want to install 10.04 on a Dell 4600 which has a new 1T SATA drive (sata on m'board) and IDE drive/s. I partitioned the new drive, but do not understand the install-prog-partitioning-window. In the end I want to be able to boot without the Windows drive in, but when it is there be able to boot XP by choice. I have 4 small old drives to copy files and integrate onto the new drive. I thought I'd put th
2010-08-13T00:07:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	 you can do pretty much what you want BUT you need to decide what you want to do, it's straight forward
2010-08-13T00:10:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	I dont know what I dont know so it's hard to ask. I am lost and it's been days. I am not going to remove the windows drive and also remove the partitions with 9.04 and see if I can install Ubuntu that way. I am in the state of "giving up". I've been into ubuntu for over a year but I'm stymied constantly. It's a neverending project. (good thing I like to tinker.)
2010-08-13T00:13:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	 like i said before, it's very ***straight forward** BUT you need to decide what you want to do.  Meaning, you now have 2 drives, you need to decide what you want on what hard drive, like I said before it's straighforward and anyone here can help you with that but we cant decide for you, YOU need to decide what you want where and then ask away, we can help you with partioning and the like, for starters-- I can tell you th
2010-08-13T00:13:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	I want ubuntu on the 1T Hitachi and Windows on the 40G. No waffeling.
2010-08-13T00:16:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	 1T is a lot of space for ubuntu, I suggest you create a live CD and use gparted to partition your drive first, the easiest install is to create 1 primary partition with 1 gig for "swap" - then create one extended partition and use all of the remaining space, then I would create an extended partition of about 10 gigs for "/" and another 20 gigs for "/home",  I would create partitions just to hold data for ubuntu and anoth
2010-08-13T00:20:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	OK I will. (I already did but not quite as you said. I have /boot / /home /d1 120-drive /d3 /d4 (boot is primary and the rest are all logical partitions on an extended partition. --- what happened was the installer said it needed me to specify a root partition. I had no idea how to do that. -----> You must understand one thing. There will be no Windows at all on the 1T Hitachi drive.
2010-08-13T00:22:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	I am saving your advice on a flashdrive
2010-08-13T00:22:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	you can install ubuntu to a second drive without a problem, that's how I began using linux, because I was afraid I might damage my windows hard drive, just make sure youre pointing at the right drive when you install ubuntu, choose to manually partition your drive
2010-08-13T00:23:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	ok I will come back and if you are here tell you how it went. I'm going to do what I said. Peace out for a while.
2010-08-13T00:23:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	and what you said.
2010-08-13T00:24:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	this is how I would partition that 1TB drive:  "swap" 1 gig -- primary,  2dary "/" 10 gigs,  2dary "/home" 20 gigs, dont really need a "/boot" partition
2010-08-13T00:24:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	like I mentioned, you dont really need a "/boot" partition, unless you know what youre doing
2010-08-13T00:37:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	hah no I dont know what I am doing, but am prepared to learn. Everyone starts out not knowing what they are doing.
2010-08-13T00:38:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	what I do not understand is why gparted and firefox keep quitting when I am using the 10.04 liveCD and not when I use the 9.04 liveCd or a 9.10 installed ubuntu.
2010-08-13T00:38:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	if youre not experienced then instead of having a "/boot" partition I would have a "/" -- "/boot" is basically used to store boot information so unless you know what youre doing I wouldnt have a "/boot" partition, just create a "swap" , "/", and "/home" partition that will hold ubuntu itself, then create 2 other partitions that will hold your data
2010-08-13T00:39:00.000Z	tucemiux	tripelb-irssi	i suspect lucid doesnt play nice with your hardware, use what you know works, no need to experiment here
2010-08-13T00:39:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	wait to answer (if you are still here) till I return in 9.04 since I cant even use firefox from this 10.04 livecd
2010-08-13T00:40:00.000Z	tripelb-irssi	tucemiux	PS the windows data partition is a good idea. I can put all media there. Glad yo mentioned it.
