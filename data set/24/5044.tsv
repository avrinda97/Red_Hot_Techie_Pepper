2009-11-08T01:39:00.000Z	foo		I'm currently at the xdm login screen on linux, but I'm ssh'd in and have a monitor hooked up (but no keyboard/mouse). Anyway I can login on X via ssh somehow?
2009-11-08T01:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	You can use ssh -X to run X apps remotely
2009-11-08T01:43:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	thanks, but that didn't answer my question :)
2009-11-15T03:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	Do you have a separate /boot?
2009-11-15T03:19:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	nope, its on the drive. hmm
2009-11-15T03:19:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	hm, grub did ask me during the upgrade what drive i wanted to install it to... i didnt select any.. maybe that was my problem? i thought it would default to the drive it was on
2009-11-15T03:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	Since grub is loading at all it must be installed
2009-11-15T03:21:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	is it possible it's from 9.04?
2009-11-15T03:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	no
2009-11-15T03:21:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	it says grub 1.96
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	Try holding shift at boot so you can see the menu and press 'e' to edit the first entry. Remove the line starting with "search" and see if you can boot then
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	any tips? im on my phone with irc. hm, i could get into a live cd, maybe
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	ok, will do
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	Ahh, you installed grub2 early in jaunty
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	yup, 1.96
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	Yes, that's the jaunty version of grub2
2009-11-15T03:22:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	ah, i see. how can i fix this?
2009-11-15T03:24:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	hm, im on my phone. actually, i think i can pull up that url, let me try. thanks
2009-11-15T03:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	np
2009-11-15T03:30:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	why didn't ubuntu warn me this would happen? I would have selected a drive ... :/ I'm not complaining because of you, I know it's not your fault, but I think it'd be smart of ubuntu to warn me
2009-11-15T03:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	There is a bug report about that
2009-11-15T03:31:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	ah, ok, thanks
2009-11-15T03:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	foo	It's much worse for people upgrading from grub legacy because grub doesn't load at all
2009-11-15T03:32:00.000Z	foo	Jordan_U	ah
