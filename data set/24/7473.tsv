2004-11-14T16:45:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	amen. :)
2004-11-14T16:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	effect and affect have quite separate meanings
2004-11-14T16:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	wrong. Look it up. Common mistake
2004-11-14T16:48:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	explain the difference ?
2004-11-14T16:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	affect can also be a noun: the "affect" refers to feeling
2004-11-14T16:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	"I effected a change which affects you "  "The effect of the change is profound"
2004-11-14T16:52:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	the second example isn't using "effect" as a verb ...
2004-11-14T16:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	to effect= to bring about  an effect= resuly of something
2004-11-14T16:54:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	yeah, I'm looking at that one ... its news to me ... but the second example wasn't an example using a verb ...
2004-11-14T16:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	it's confusing in that both can be used as verbs AND nouns
2004-11-14T17:01:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	I bow down to your superior liguistic prowess ...
2004-11-14T17:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	well, this is one of my pet pedantic peeves: very few people use thes words correctly :)
2004-11-14T17:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mercurus	hehe - this is the kind of thing up with which I will not put!
2004-11-14T17:06:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	I don't like "this" either :P
2004-11-14T17:07:00.000Z	mercurus	thoreauputic	the number of essays I've read in which "this" is attempting to serve as a sentence's object, and refers to nothing I can identify ...
