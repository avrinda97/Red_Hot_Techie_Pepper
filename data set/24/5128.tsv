2007-08-30T09:11:00.000Z	stefano		Does having ssh-daemon on make my linux pc-server more vulnerable to attacks?
2007-08-30T09:11:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	unless you're behind a firewall or NAT-router, yes.
2007-08-30T09:12:00.000Z	stefano	cosmodad	how could i tell if i am behind a NAT-router?
2007-08-30T09:13:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	well do you use a router?
2007-08-30T09:13:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	iptables is a firewall.
2007-08-30T09:15:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	right now, I can connect to your IP on SSH port
2007-08-30T09:15:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	only if passwords are picked in  dumb fashion
2007-08-30T09:15:00.000Z	stefano	cosmodad	What does that mean?
2007-08-30T09:16:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	it means you're either not behind a firewall/NAT or you are forwarding SSH port to your machine
2007-08-30T09:16:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	if you meant the password note: it means picking too simple passwords
2007-08-30T09:18:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	an even better bet is you pick a hard password for your users, restrict ssh to only the users you need and possibly disable password login
2007-08-30T09:18:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	unless a hacker knows your password, you're right safe.
2007-08-30T09:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	the whole world uses SSH. Just make sure you know how to harden it.
2007-08-30T09:19:00.000Z	stefano	cosmodad	does the prompt say stefano server?
2007-08-30T09:19:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	it doesn't say anything
2007-08-30T09:20:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	you don't get that info prior to logging in
2007-08-30T09:20:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	not the easy way I think...
2007-08-30T09:20:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	it's better to make a user only for external logins
2007-08-30T09:20:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	and give that user a really tough password
2007-08-30T09:21:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	you should take a look at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, especially AllowUser(s?)
2007-08-30T09:21:00.000Z	stefano	cosmodad	great... ill take a look at it. Does man pages have more info on it?
2007-08-30T09:21:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	AllowUser
2007-08-30T09:21:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	tons!
2007-08-30T09:22:00.000Z	cosmodad	stefano	you can do an awful lot with ssh.
