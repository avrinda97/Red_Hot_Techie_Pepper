2008-04-22T10:16:00.000Z	Millertime_018		how do i pastebin my sources list?
2008-04-22T10:16:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Type "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
2008-04-22T10:19:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Okay... you don't have the Partner repos enabled (look at lines 44 and 45... see the # at the beginning?  That tells the software to ignore that line)
2008-04-22T10:20:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Close gedit.  THen type this in the terminal:  gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-22T10:20:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Once that opens up, go down to those two lines and remove the # at the beginning. Then save the file. Let me know what that's done.
2008-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	No.
2008-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Just remove the "#" at the beginning of those lines.
2008-04-22T10:23:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Who do you want help from? lol
2008-04-22T10:24:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Do what bazhang said.  Add a "#" to the beginning of the first line.  Save again.
2008-04-22T10:25:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	After that, close gedit and type this in the terminal: sudo apt-get update
2008-04-22T10:25:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Yes, the first line.... starts with "deb cdrom"
2008-04-22T10:25:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	sudo apt-get update
2008-04-22T10:26:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Now, yes.
2008-04-22T10:30:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Okay.  Try running this:  sudo apt-get install -f
2008-04-22T10:30:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	That will attempt to fix any broken dependancies (programs that are required by other programs in order to run - much like a game depends on DirectX in Windows)
2008-04-22T10:32:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Your difficulties are rare :)
2008-04-22T10:32:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	In fact, I just tried to install it and had no issues.
2008-04-22T10:32:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Try running the install command again.
2008-04-22T10:33:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Yes.
2008-04-22T10:35:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Well, unfortunately I can't reproduce the problem here, so there is some strange issue going on there.
2008-04-22T10:35:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Can you try pastebin your sources.list again?
2008-04-22T10:36:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-22T10:37:00.000Z	Millertime_018	Creationist	http://pastebin.ca/992883
2008-04-22T10:39:00.000Z	Creationist	Millertime_018	Hmmm... that all looks right.  Unfortunately, we've reached the limit of my knowledge.  But now you know that you CAN install vmware.  Just start asking about how to fix the broken dependencies issue.  See if anyone else can help you with that.  I've got to head to bed.  Good luck.
