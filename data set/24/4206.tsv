2008-12-02T04:14:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	bah! updates brake shit
2008-12-02T04:14:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	break even
2008-12-02T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	quoting someone "...anecdotal evidence (yours) is not evidence at all..."
2008-12-02T04:17:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	I could give you an example with several witenesses :)
2008-12-02T04:18:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	updating (Debian actually in this case, but still updating) caused asterisk to completely bork out
2008-12-02T04:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	it would be still just *one* example (even if you has a hundred machines with ubuntu that not makes a statiscally good population ;P)
2008-12-02T04:20:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	if I had a hundred machines that used asterisk then 100% of them would of failed too :)
2008-12-02T04:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	that would have made just a hundred cases on the thousans if not millions of debian/ubuntu installs
2008-12-02T04:21:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	should I scale this up then?  It would of failed on x number of installs that upgraded as it was a fault with the package :)
2008-12-02T04:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	then my point still stands it was not a problem of upgrading per se but with a specific package
2008-12-02T04:23:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	that is an example of when updating can be dangerous, if you fix a bug in a program you usually introduce new bugs in doing so
2008-12-02T04:24:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	This occurs as the complexity of a program increases
2008-12-02T04:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	well this is not going anywhere we can agree we disagree... but encouragin users to disable updates in this channel still is not wellcomed
2008-12-02T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	it will work just fine i use "su someotheruser" from time to time
2008-12-02T04:25:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	I am encourging vigilance :) updating and thinking your computer is now safer / stablier is not the right approach :)
2008-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	you have set a root password?
2008-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	no
2008-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	weird, they must of changed that in pam since the last time I tried it (7.04 or something i think it was)
2008-12-02T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	but i can switch to my systers user su is not only used to switvh to root althought that's the default action when not given a username in command line
2008-12-02T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	man page has all the details
2008-12-02T04:27:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	yes, same with sudo
2008-12-02T04:27:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	I would use sudo
2008-12-02T04:27:00.000Z	phix	erUSUL	su is bad practice nowdays
2008-12-02T04:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	phix	well the use case is: my sister neeeds something that requieres sudo she is not in sudoers i su to my account use sudo and exit
