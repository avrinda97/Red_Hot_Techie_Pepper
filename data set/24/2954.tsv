2011-12-09T00:06:00.000Z	helo		i can't get the grub boot menu to pop up, and don't get any display with these two ati cards plugged in
2011-12-09T00:06:00.000Z	helo		seems like a server install wouldn't mess with the effing framebuffer in the first place
2011-12-09T00:07:00.000Z	nemo	helo	if you're not seeing the grub boot menu that seems a bit far from blaming linux :)
2011-12-09T00:07:00.000Z	nemo	helo	does any display work before that? like, the usual boot/post stuff?
2011-12-09T00:07:00.000Z	helo		of course heh
2011-12-09T00:07:00.000Z	helo		i just ran the ubuntu install from usb
2011-12-09T00:08:00.000Z	nemo	helo	ah. cool. ok. well. I know grub has a simple low res mode...
2011-12-09T00:08:00.000Z	nemo		not that I know how to set it up or anything ;)
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	nemo	helo	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Resolution_Settings perhaps?
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	nemo	helo	but I thought there was one that didn't use fb at all...
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	helo	nemo	there is no interface that i am presented with at all to change anything
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	helo		i would be able to set vga=normal nomodeset if i could get _anything_
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	nemo	helo	well. that's for once you actually boot
2011-12-09T00:09:00.000Z	helo		as it is, looks like i'm going to do a blind login from console and use netcat to get a remote login
2011-12-09T00:10:00.000Z	helo	nemo	it's booting, but it isn't giving me any output at all
2011-12-09T00:10:00.000Z	nemo	helo	yeah. but I mean, the fact you see nothing at the grub boot screen makes me think it has more to do w/ the new graphical grub boot
2011-12-09T00:10:00.000Z	nemo	helo	which I'm guessing uses fb?  I mean, how else to render pretty images instead of text
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	helo		it's ok, i have my remote netcat bash going now :)
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	nemo	helo	heh. looks like there's a config option for console grub
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	nemo	helo	of course you'll have to get in first
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	nemo		# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	nemo		#GRUB_TERMINAL=console
2011-12-09T00:11:00.000Z	nemo	helo	then you'd have to do update-grub I guess
2011-12-09T00:12:00.000Z	nemo	helo	and. yeah. why that isn't default on a server...
