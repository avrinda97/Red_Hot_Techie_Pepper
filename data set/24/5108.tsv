2010-01-08T03:37:00.000Z	frederick85		is there a way to limit my bandwidth usage
2010-01-08T03:37:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	yes
2010-01-08T03:38:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	well i'm playing games and my housemate is complaining about not being able to load internet pages how can I resolve it
2010-01-08T03:39:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	online gaming shouldn't interfer with web browsing. usually its the other way round. what online game ?
2010-01-08T03:39:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	well it's wow, i'm connected via a ethernet cable and they were connected via wireless
2010-01-08T03:40:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	imo their problem is the wifi and their computer not your game
2010-01-08T03:40:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	how much bandwidth does your internet connection have ?
2010-01-08T03:40:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	quite low at the moment because it's shaped
2010-01-08T03:40:00.000Z	frederick85		shaped at about 10kb
2010-01-08T03:40:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	that is the problem then
2010-01-08T03:41:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	10 kb/sec is pretty much going to affect most things
2010-01-08T03:41:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	is there a way i can set my computer to only use a lesser ammount of it
2010-01-08T03:41:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	im suprised you are not having latency issues while you are shaped.
2010-01-08T03:42:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	wow doesn't even use 4kb/s
2010-01-08T03:42:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	the game doesn't seem to use much bandwidth
2010-01-08T03:42:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	i think your housemate(S) are pretty misinformed tbh
2010-01-08T03:43:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	they should use something to scrub adverts from webpages they view (like adblockplus and noscript)
2010-01-08T03:43:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	well i had a problem with them unplugging my part of the connection and i couldn't get their attention because they are deaf
2010-01-08T03:44:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	then if the adsl connection isnt owned by you and they are ignorant and unwillining to understand the basics of networking there is nothing you can do
2010-01-08T03:45:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	i'm paying for the whole thing,
2010-01-08T03:45:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	then do something about it
2010-01-08T03:46:00.000Z	frederick85	airtonix	i guess i'll just go to sleep and hope they don't unplug it again
2010-01-08T03:46:00.000Z	frederick85		night
2010-01-08T03:47:00.000Z	airtonix	frederick85	seriously, i watch my network connection while playing online games and using browsers : browsers will spike to consume the entire connection until it gets all hte page data...online games at most use up to 6kb/s
