2005-09-24T05:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	nope; my last instruction, that is.
2005-09-24T05:53:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	nothing is always up;)

2005-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	ya, its pretty cool. I will strip it a little, we will use openbox. a lab with computers that can boot off the CD and network configured with dhcp, a class of Unix newbies, from a unix class, what more can you ask for.

2005-09-29T06:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	you'd be surprised by how many have asked so far :P
2005-09-29T07:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	Opera is indeed great
2005-10-21T11:19:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	its obvious? I never noticed that is what he wanted:P
2005-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	cause someone does not know that? Its not like its common knowledge...
2005-10-21T15:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	I have never in my life (of all my long hours in this channel) seen someone investigate with prefixing all factoids with ubuntu
2005-10-29T06:07:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	somehow he got remved from admin.,..
2005-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	and has no other account with sudo powers, or no root account setup?
2005-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	dabaR	apokryphos	well seems so...
2005-11-07T09:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	how?
2006-10-26T12:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	you should probably have a -t ext3 in there
2006-10-26T12:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	oh wait, you do, but didn' thave the space
2006-11-27T11:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	dabaR	worth checking if there's any active ops first sometimes :P
