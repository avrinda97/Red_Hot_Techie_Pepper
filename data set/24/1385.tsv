2012-05-07T07:32:00.000Z	mikeliss		Anybody know how to dump the entire screen scrollback buffer to file?
2012-05-07T07:32:00.000Z	mikeliss		Or how to determine the scrollback buffer length?
2012-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	hardcopy
2012-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	I just tried that...looks like it only gave me the visible part of the scrollback buffer?
2012-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	quiescens		i don't suppose you looked at the docs for it?
2012-05-07T07:34:00.000Z	quiescens		there should be a -h option
2012-05-07T07:35:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	I did, but I use screen so infrequently they're all greek to me (e.g: (C-a h, C-a C-h))
2012-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	you can Ca :
2012-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	I used the -h option, I did CTRL+SHIFT+:, then hardcopy -h ~/scrollback.txt
2012-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	Ca :?
2012-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	well, whatever brings up screen's command line entry for you
2012-05-07T07:37:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	I think Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+SHIFT+: is doing it...never used it this way before.
2012-05-07T07:38:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	So then I do hardcopy -h filename.txt, and it doesn't seem to do anything more than the visible part of the screen.
2012-05-07T07:45:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	either your output was drawn by something using absolute screen positioning commands, or your scrollback is set really low or off
2012-05-07T07:45:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	Doing C-a i tells me that it's set to 1024 lines...no idea why hardcopying it doesn't work.
2012-05-07T07:46:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	In any case, I'm filing a bug that 1024 is WAY too low. Can't imagine why it's not 100,000 or something.
2012-05-07T07:46:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	shrug, the one i just tried gave me 1042 lines
2012-05-07T07:47:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	i doubt there will be a bug accepted for what is a configurable setting
2012-05-07T07:47:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	Yeah....seems to be the default, which makes sense if you have, say 2MB of RAM, but every now and then it can save you...times like now, for example, and it sucks when it doesn't work.
2012-05-07T07:48:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	moreover, the default is actually 100 lines, so you already have something changing the setting to 1000 if that is what yours is
2012-05-07T07:48:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	Perhaps an Ubuntu thing....how did you figure out the default is 100?
2012-05-07T07:48:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	I haven't changed the default though to my knowledge.
2012-05-07T07:49:00.000Z	quiescens	mikeliss	man page says the default is 100 as far as screen is concerned
2012-05-07T07:49:00.000Z	mikeliss	quiescens	Ah. Hadn't found that yet. Good to know.
