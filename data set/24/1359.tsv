2010-02-20T02:47:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX		What are you trying to do, Gaudi?
2010-02-20T02:47:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	checking if the iso I downloaded is not corrupted
2010-02-20T02:48:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	where are you getting stuck?
2010-02-20T02:49:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	someone gave me this page http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows, but I am afraid I can't completely understand it
2010-02-20T02:49:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX		So, Gaudi, you are currently using Windows, right?
2010-02-20T02:49:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	I already downloaded the file, opened the command prompt but I do not how to keep
2010-02-20T02:50:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	yes because I am installing Linux on my laptop, and the last iso I downloaded was corrupted
2010-02-20T02:50:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	and the computer I am right now got Vista cuz is the family computer
2010-02-20T02:50:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX		Okay, Gaudi, where did you save the file given on the first line of the post? ("C:\programs\md5sum.exe" or something along those lines)
2010-02-20T02:51:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	I already moved it to system32 as the post says
2010-02-20T02:52:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	try typing "md5sum" by itself and press return. Let me know the gist of what it says.
2010-02-20T02:53:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	No such file
2010-02-20T02:54:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	your problem, then, is that system32 is not in PATH. Type the following two commands: "C:" "cd \Windows\system32"
2010-02-20T02:54:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	once that's done, try running "md5sum" again.
2010-02-20T02:55:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	I am on system32 I just did that
2010-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	type 'dir md5sum*'. Make sure it shows that 'md5sum.exe' is in the same directory you're looking at.
2010-02-20T02:56:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	1 file md5sum.exe
2010-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Gaudi	try ".\md5sum.exe"
2010-02-20T02:58:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	no such file
2010-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX		I'm afraid you're beyond my knowledge of Windows, then, Gaudi, but you can find GUI-based MD5sum utilities pretty easily.
2010-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	well is there another way to check if my iso is corrupt?
2010-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Gaudi		cuz I don't really feel like wasting cds
2010-02-20T03:00:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX		Also, Gaudi, the CD has a "check CD for defects" option, if you don't mind using the disc or mounting it in Virtualbox.
2010-02-20T03:01:00.000Z	Gaudi	Red_HamsterX	I am going to burn it, hopefully it will run properly
