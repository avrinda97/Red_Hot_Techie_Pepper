2007-02-10T14:25:00.000Z	newest		omg this frostwire installation is soo frustrating
2007-02-10T14:26:00.000Z	newest		sorry, i have no idea what nautilus is, im totally new to ubuntu
2007-02-10T14:27:00.000Z	newest		this is what i get when im trying to install frostwire with the wiki advice : dpkg: error processing FrostWire-4.10.9-2.i586.deb (--install):

2007-02-10T14:27:00.000Z	newest		but why dont they show on the desktop?
2007-02-10T14:28:00.000Z	newest		can i only see them using the terminal?
2007-02-10T14:28:00.000Z	nocti	newest	it wont show on the desktop desktop. it's in your /home/newest/Desktop folder
2007-02-10T14:31:00.000Z	nocti	newest	nautilus is just like your window$ explorer. it's a filemanager. go look for it in your Gnome menu. i cant show you cause im not running gnome.
2007-02-10T14:32:00.000Z	nocti	newest	that means you dont have the frostwire debfile in the same directory as the command you're running in
2007-02-10T14:33:00.000Z	nocti	newest	make sure you actually *see* the frostwire*.deb file
2007-02-10T14:33:00.000Z	nocti	newest	where is it
2007-02-10T14:34:00.000Z	nocti	newest	then run your usual dpkg -i frostwire-blabla.deb
2007-02-10T14:36:00.000Z	nocti	newest	are you using nautilus or a terminal?
2007-02-10T14:37:00.000Z	nocti	newest	what directory are you located
2007-02-10T14:37:00.000Z	nocti	newest	cwd
2007-02-10T14:37:00.000Z	nocti	newest	is the frostwire.deb file in Desktop?
2007-02-10T14:38:00.000Z	nocti	newest	ls -l *.deb
2007-02-10T14:38:00.000Z	nocti	newest	are you sure it's there? do an 'ls -l *.deb'
2007-02-10T14:39:00.000Z	nocti	newest	ls -l *.deb
2007-02-10T14:39:00.000Z	nocti	newest	there are spaces...
