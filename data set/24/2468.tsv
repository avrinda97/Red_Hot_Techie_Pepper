2010-05-06T14:53:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	ok
2010-05-06T14:51:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	what was  your issue sir, if i may ask? , i just joined
2010-05-06T14:53:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	I can't connect to my local mySQL server since the upgrade to 10.04.
2010-05-06T14:55:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Any ideas on a fix? I've tried restarting, but the 'service mysql restart' process just hangs without any output. When I choose to just start the service, it tells me its already running.
2010-05-06T14:56:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	is port open , what happens if you do >> mysql -u root -p
2010-05-06T14:57:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Same error as mentioned above.
2010-05-06T14:57:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	did this happen after update, or did you setup user or made some admin mysql changes?
2010-05-06T14:58:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Does the port need to be open, seeing as it's on a local machine? Don't think I've had to before. And yes, it happened after the upgrade, made no changes since first install in September last year.
2010-05-06T15:00:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	would help
2010-05-06T15:01:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	try to reconfigure it?
2010-05-06T15:02:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	can you open terminal, will try something if thats ok :)
2010-05-06T15:03:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	My terminal's open already.
2010-05-06T15:03:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.1 << replace with your version
2010-05-06T15:03:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	backup /var/lib/mysql
2010-05-06T15:05:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	any luck ?
2010-05-06T15:06:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Just trying to move the /var/lib/mysql folder
2010-05-06T15:06:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	backup mean copy, not move,
2010-05-06T15:07:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Yeah, that too. Lol. I knew what I meant. Haha
2010-05-06T15:11:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	I create root password, it stops the service, I get the following output: "100506 11:15:39 [Note] Plugin 'FEDERATED' is disabled.
2010-05-06T15:11:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	use pastebin please
2010-05-06T15:12:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Yeah, sorry dude. But then it just hangs after that.
2010-05-06T15:12:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	hmm hangs again
2010-05-06T15:13:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	geekphreak	Yeah, it's weird. Maybe an uninstall and reinstall will fix it?
2010-05-06T15:14:00.000Z	geekphreak	Lord`Saladin	any important databases made, yes worth a shot
