2004-11-03T11:23:00.000Z	Pizbit		Ok here's a question, are there any good alarom programs in ubuntu thay you're aware of?
2004-11-03T11:23:00.000Z	Pizbit		alarm*
2004-11-03T11:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	...does Evolution have one?
2004-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I detest evolution
2004-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	how about xcal or the alarm plugin for XMMS?
2004-11-03T11:28:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I use the alarm plugin for xmms currently
2005-04-08T07:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	heh
2005-04-04T14:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	please don't aoss either esd or polypaudio, since both of them provide native alsa backends
2005-04-04T14:58:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I need to have them dmix'd :P
2005-04-04T14:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	you're just adding unnecessary latency if you do that
2005-04-04T14:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	then overload default and hw:0,0
2005-04-04T14:58:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	The only stuff that needs esd/polypaudio don't care about latency
2005-04-04T14:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	true, dmix is a monstrous latency issue.
2005-04-04T14:59:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	er, "overload default and hw:0,0" ?
2005-04-04T15:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	yep, with ~/.asoundrc || /etc/asound.conf
2005-04-04T15:01:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I have absolutely no idea what you're blathering about with regards to "overload default and hw:0,0", to put my point across bluntly.
2005-04-04T15:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	dmix all native alsa apps by default
2005-04-04T15:02:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I just grabbed a ~/.asoundrc off a webpage:)
2005-04-04T15:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	6 Apr
2005-04-08T07:29:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	I look at grub everynight...
2005-04-08T07:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Pizbit	do you purposefully turn off your computer though? :)
2005-04-08T07:29:00.000Z	Pizbit	crimsun	*cough*pun*cough*
