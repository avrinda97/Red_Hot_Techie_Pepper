2005-01-20T13:28:00.000Z	jeronimo		yes... I don't want to... because I've to be root to execute those commands...
2005-01-20T13:28:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	hotplug is managing the devices and you have a NIC that is able to post a link-status
2005-01-20T13:31:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	problem is .. hotplug is not a daemon running in the background .. it is facilitated by kernel
2005-01-20T13:32:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	Go to your /etc/network/interfaces line and comment the line that says map eth0 under the hotplug mapping
2005-01-20T13:33:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	there's no such line... :(
2005-01-20T13:34:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	no line that says mapping hotplug?
2005-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	no, nothing... only setting loopback... and static ip for eth0 and dhcp for eth1
2005-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	I can send you the content of that file if tou want...
2005-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	sorry, you
2005-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	Ya ... sorry I couldnt help though ... there must be something disconnecting that device. That would be hotplug
2005-01-20T13:38:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	Or something related
2005-01-20T13:38:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	I am looking into it for you
2005-01-20T13:38:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	hmm...  Thank you a lot for your time!
2005-01-20T13:39:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	Just for S&Gs .... try adding your nic module to the /etc/hotplug/blacklist file at the top and adding the module to your /etc/modules file and rebooting
2005-01-20T13:40:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	ok. dont know then!
2005-01-20T13:40:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	lol
2005-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	:-/ anyway, thank you very much...
2005-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	It is wierd that the device is going down when the link is unplugged without a hotplug mapping
2005-01-20T13:42:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	In desperation add it to /etc/hotplug/blacklist anyway?? lol
2005-01-20T13:43:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	here're the differences before and after unplugging the cable (using ifconfig): BEFORE: UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1   AFTER: UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
2005-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	that's the only line that's different from ifconfig output...
2005-01-20T13:45:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	odd
2005-01-20T13:46:00.000Z	nuOpus	jeronimo	well .... im still wondering what is listening to your device
2005-01-20T13:48:00.000Z	jeronimo	nuOpus	I'm trying to solve it more than 3 weeks... I'm really at the end of my ideas... :(
