2007-06-17T14:09:00.000Z	cormarrr		I'm having trouble installing Ubutnu, anyone got a sec to help?
2007-06-17T14:09:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	what sort of trouble?
2007-06-17T14:10:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	I can't get the partitions right, I get the error "No root file system defined"
2007-06-17T14:11:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	yes.  whichever partition you'd like to install Ubuntu to, set that partition to have mount point / .  Understand?
2007-06-17T14:11:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	I have done that and I still get the error
2007-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	could you post a screenshot?
2007-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	Post it to where?
2007-06-17T14:15:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	http://imageshack.us/
2007-06-17T14:17:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	That begs the greater question, how do I take a screenshot from the live CD?
2007-06-17T14:18:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	print-screen button
2007-06-17T14:19:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	I tried that, nothing happens when I try to paste it into GIMP
2007-06-17T14:20:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	why are you using GIMP?  print-screen will produce a file while you will upload to imageshack.
2007-06-17T14:20:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	When I hit Print Screen nothing seems to happen
2007-06-17T14:21:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	try the GNOME menu.  Applications > Accessories > Screen Shot, I think.
2007-06-17T14:24:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	okay, registering an account with the screenshot now
2007-06-17T14:25:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/9369/screenshoteu7.png
2007-06-17T14:26:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	:)  you've got a period after the forward slash.  get rid of the period.
2007-06-17T14:27:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	You might just be my hero
2007-06-17T14:27:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	Welcome to Ubuntu.  :)  haha
2007-06-17T14:28:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	it is installing, looks OK so far, thanks so much!
2007-06-17T14:28:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	no problem.  let us know if anything is unclear.
2007-06-17T14:29:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	anyway to reclaim that unused 6GB and the weird 1GB partition? I have XP on the 50GB one, but not sure what the others are
2007-06-17T14:31:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	cormarrr	if you're unsure, sda3 may be associated with Windows somehow, so don't nuke it til you know.  the unusable is a mystery to me.
2007-06-17T14:32:00.000Z	cormarrr	dawn_chorus	Originally it was part of the 8GB "restore" partition on my HP laptop, but I resized it down to a 2GB SWAP and it made the other 6GB unusable, not sure at all about the random 1GB
