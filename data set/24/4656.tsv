2007-02-13T09:03:00.000Z	jfanaian_		My wireless was working before, but now it isn't showing up with either iwconfig or ifconfig even though in ndiswrapper it shows it as present

2007-02-13T09:06:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	 look under /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf  and see if your interface is there
2007-02-13T09:06:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	the file is empty
2007-02-13T09:07:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	oh its a dir
2007-02-13T09:07:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	this means the kernel never detected any  of your networking stuff
2007-02-13T09:07:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	in ipv4/conf it has all, default, and lo
2007-02-13T09:08:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	what are listed there? be precise now.
2007-02-13T09:08:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Three directories, all, default, lo... each with a bucnh fo files like accept_redirects, accept_source_route, arp_accept, etc.
2007-02-13T09:08:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Each seem to have the same files
2007-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	If I do lshw the wireless card does show up but it says "UNCLAIMED" for it
2007-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	that just shows you dont have a nic recognized..it would have something like eth0 or wlan0
2007-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	my eth0 is working fine... i'm using it and i can browse the internet
2007-02-13T09:10:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	i asked you to be precise when listing whats on that directory, you didnt mention eth0
2007-02-13T09:10:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	It doesn't have eth0 in there... I told you everything that is in there
2007-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	and your eth0 is working you say?
2007-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Yup
2007-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	that is really odd..all has to show up under /proc
2007-02-13T09:12:00.000Z	bulmer	jfanaian_	it should, thats the only it will work
2007-02-13T09:12:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Yeah sorry about that =\... I didn't have it loaded, I had to get an IP first and now its showing up, but my wlan0 is not showing up
2007-02-13T09:14:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Well, how would I go about that?
2007-02-13T09:14:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	Oh... Okay I will try to see what I can find
2007-02-13T09:18:00.000Z	jfanaian_	bulmer	So what you're saying is that I should try to figure out how this script loads an interface and try to manually load wlan0?
