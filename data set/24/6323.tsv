2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	cryptom		Hi all, for quite some year I've been compiling my own kernels, at least a year with make-kpkg under debian and now under breezy. But now, either I am doing something wrong or there might be a bug in "kernel-package
2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	cryptom		I get lots of modprobe errors while booting the initrd image
2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	cryptom		when I manually open the initrd file and execute a depmod -a, rebuild the initrd image, everything works fine
2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	cryptom		I have to add: I use the kernel from kernel.org, not the [k] ubuntu packages
2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	cryptom		am I the only one to experience this behavior?
2006-01-21T13:33:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	do you need an initrd?
2006-01-21T13:34:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	I just use my custom kernel/modules and no initrd
2006-01-21T13:34:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	seems so in order to keep the splash
2006-01-21T13:34:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	right
2006-01-21T13:34:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	I used to do it that way to, but i kind of like the splash
2006-01-21T13:35:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	personally I just went with bootsplash instead
2006-01-21T13:35:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	seems as if the depmod -a after building the kernel is missing... because all the modules.* files are missing in the initrd
2006-01-21T13:35:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	never tried that one, is it comparable to [k] ubuntu splash?
2006-01-21T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	well you need to pathc the kernel. no big deal though
2006-01-21T13:36:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	patching is not the issue...
2006-01-21T13:36:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	just like to keep it simple and nice (thats why I switched to [k] ubuntu)
2006-01-21T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	then you get a nice 16bit color 1024x768 boot screen
2006-01-21T13:37:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	and you just make the splash initrd with the utility that comes with it. it doesn't depend on anything but the kernel patch
2006-01-21T13:38:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	cool, will try that, thanks
2006-01-21T13:42:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	is there a way to get something between all boot messages (verbose) and silent? like it is done in [k] ubuntu?
2006-01-21T13:43:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	I don't know how that looks. it support ttf text messages and animations that can be executed from the init scripts
2006-01-21T13:44:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	for example you could show animated connecting computers when the network comes up or display a text message in color
2006-01-21T13:45:00.000Z	mwe	cryptom	you can also get a progress bar
2006-01-21T13:46:00.000Z	cryptom	mwe	ok, then I will have a closer look at it
