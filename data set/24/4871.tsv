2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	Eclypse		haha, I hate what happens to popular channels like this.
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	Eclypse		turns into a huge bot channel with tons of regulation and things you can and cannot do. reminds me of religion
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Eclypse	What happens?
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	Eclypse		and of course there are good justifications to make the person stating such things seem like an idiot who is making a big deal out of nothing.
2006-12-24T13:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		afaik!
2006-12-24T13:07:00.000Z	Eclypse		anyways, I try launching Warcraft III in cedega and after reading the CD for over 20 seconds it says no cd found...
2006-12-24T13:07:00.000Z	Eclypse		and I've tried many things to fix this and I can't seem to figure out how  . . .
2006-12-24T13:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		Eclype: Codeweavers supposedly works very well with WoW
2006-12-24T13:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		http://www.codeweavers.com

2006-12-24T13:08:00.000Z	Eclypse	nolimitsoya	I highly doubt nobody in here can help me.
2006-12-24T13:09:00.000Z	Eclypse		no, it was on Warcraft 3
2006-12-24T13:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Eclypse	then why ask?
