2005-07-18T08:14:00.000Z	mebaran151		I am going to have to use Breezy
2005-07-18T08:14:00.000Z	mebaran151		does anyone know how production ready Breezy is
2005-07-18T08:14:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	not.
2005-07-18T08:14:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	I am a developer
2005-07-18T08:16:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	are you having trouble with ruby?
2005-07-18T08:17:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	yep
2005-07-18T08:18:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	but the community is G-d awful dont you think?
2005-07-18T08:18:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	it can be a bit trying
2005-07-18T08:19:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	eh, the ruby DB layer is pretty much the same as Perl's
2005-07-18T08:20:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	yeah they write so much cool stuff
2005-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	it woudl be better if I could go on IRC
2005-07-18T08:21:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	it would help if more of the community spoke english :P
2005-07-18T08:22:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	if you want hilarity, take a look at the ruby-gnome2-devel-en list
2005-07-18T08:26:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	...I think we may be talking at cross purposes here
2005-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	X works in breezy
2005-07-18T08:52:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	Why do you need to run breezy?
2005-07-18T08:53:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	there's no backport?
2005-07-18T08:58:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	yes they are, i just misunderstand the problem
2005-07-18T08:59:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	if that didn't work, arr.each do |a| h[a[2] ]  = Array.new end before the other code
2005-07-18T09:02:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	but we were still able to cobble together a not awful way of doing it with just a little thought
2005-07-18T09:03:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	now it does make sense
2005-07-18T09:04:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	the most important thing you can do to learn ruby better is to pla with it in ri
2005-07-18T09:06:00.000Z	teferi_	mebaran151	yeah, one of the things that annoys me about python is that because of the whole whitespace thing, it's very hard to experiment with in the interactive interpreter
2005-07-18T09:06:00.000Z	mebaran151	teferi_	yep
