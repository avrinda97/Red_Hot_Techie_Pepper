2005-03-15T14:00:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	kernel-image => Debian. linux-image => Ubuntu
2005-10-05T07:30:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	what possible legal problem could one face from running GPL software?
2005-10-05T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	if $legal says "no", then you can't. It's that simple.
2005-10-05T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	in practice, that rarely happens.
2005-10-18T11:40:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	nothing yet except to adjust the volume control. Or, if you have a particular model, you can pass it as a quirk.
2005-10-18T11:40:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	the 'master volume' setting does nothing.. and all the volume apps insist on using that
2005-10-18T11:41:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	you can change the volume control
2005-10-18T11:41:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	how?
2005-10-18T11:41:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	secondary-click and choose properties
2005-10-18T11:41:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	oh, you mean adjust Headphone and nevermind about Master Volume? that's what I'm doing atm..
2005-10-18T11:42:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	modinfo <your sound card driver>
2005-10-18T11:42:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	already did that, I can't see anything that would help
2005-10-18T11:42:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	modinfo snd_ali5451.. do you see anything in there?
2005-10-18T11:43:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	I'm not on a Linux machine atm
2005-10-18T11:43:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	#flood for a moment?
2005-10-18T11:43:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	idle there
2005-10-18T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	ah well, you have to just use that. Some applications offer a software mixer.
2005-10-18T11:45:00.000Z	tga	crimsun	what about the vol-up and vol-down keys on my keyboard? how can I get those to use Headphone?
2005-10-18T11:45:00.000Z	crimsun	tga	yes, you'll have to use amixer
