2009-07-09T01:56:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	also not when ur choosing terminate
2009-07-09T01:56:00.000Z	sheep96783		hibernate turns the hdd off doesn't it?
2009-07-09T01:57:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	i thought so like standy on windows
2009-07-09T01:57:00.000Z	sheep96783		hibernate is on windows too
2009-07-09T01:57:00.000Z	sheep96783		my laptop doesn't like hibernate. it just gives me the blinking _ and nothing else
2009-07-09T01:57:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	ah other language on my windows its like stanby
2009-07-09T01:58:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	it turns the hdd down but saves what u were doing for the next time
2009-07-09T01:58:00.000Z	sheep96783		standby is on windows, it's the same as hibernate except you can't come out of it. useless feature
2009-07-09T01:59:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	stanby = ur memory is still running hibernate : the thing on memory on stanby is on the hdd
2009-07-09T01:59:00.000Z	sheep96783	skylight	is the blinking _ normal then? if so, how come out?
2009-07-09T01:59:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	just push ur power button once
2009-07-09T02:00:00.000Z	sheep96783		i think i tried that. i'll test agaoin
2009-07-09T02:04:00.000Z	sheep96783		are you sure hibernate doesn't turn the hdd off, because it seemed like my laptop was completely off
2009-07-09T02:04:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	hibernate does
2009-07-09T02:04:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	standby doesnt
2009-07-09T02:05:00.000Z	sheep96783		oook
2009-07-09T02:05:00.000Z	sheep96783		but ubuntu doesn't have standby, which i'm wanting
2009-07-09T02:05:00.000Z	sheep96783		what's suspend?
2009-07-09T02:06:00.000Z	skylight	sheep96783	think like stanby
