2009-07-11T07:13:00.000Z	pam		Are non stripped binaries published somewhere via packages? (my firefox segfaults on Jaunty)
2009-07-11T07:14:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	non stripped?
2009-07-11T07:14:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	Aren't binaries stripped by default? Just assumed, still trying to attach gdb to firefox
2009-07-11T07:15:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	thats a new term for me :)
2009-07-11T07:16:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	oh, Meaning that symbols, location, asserts, ... are still in the blob
2009-07-11T07:16:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	you usually strip before shipping, as it reduces the size of the executable
2009-07-11T07:16:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	ok gotcha, thanks
2009-07-11T07:25:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	cf firefox-3.5-dbg for 3.5. Can't find for 3.0 though
2009-07-11T07:28:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	hmm: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-mozillateam-bugs/2008-June/047318.html
2009-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	I'm so confused between firefox-3.0-dbgsym, firefox-3.5-dbg, ... Not sure if they build them or not now
2009-07-11T07:30:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	np, I thought it was strange too
2009-07-11T07:32:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	04:31:05 < wgrant> pam: Debug symbols for most Ubuntu packages are on ddebs.ubuntu.com.
2009-07-11T07:33:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	and ff are in that wad?  I'll have to take a peek later.  Good to know :)
2009-07-11T07:35:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	Just FYI, http://pastebin.com/m7ca4a60d from #ubuntu-devel
2009-07-11T07:35:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	not sure what automated symbol extraction means though actually
2009-07-11T07:36:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	ah, now that makes sense
2009-07-11T07:37:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	to have firefox-3.5-dbg in normal repos but not firefox-3.0-dbg? No, it doesn't :p
2009-07-11T07:37:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	well 3.5 was alpha/beta until recently so my guess is someone did it prior to it hitting repo's.  So you may want to avoid that (not that you were seeking it...)
2009-07-11T07:40:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	thanks, your question taught me a bunch today :)
2009-07-11T07:41:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	my pleasure!

2009-07-11T09:08:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	thanks...still strange what has occured if that is true.
2009-07-11T09:09:00.000Z	pam	Jeruvy	yeah, will answer, still lost on my side :)
2009-07-11T09:10:00.000Z	Jeruvy	pam	you're not alone :)
