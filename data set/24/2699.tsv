2008-09-18T02:32:00.000Z	ozzloy		i'm having networking issues.  i can't ping anything from one computer, except for its own ip
2008-09-18T02:32:00.000Z	ozzloy		i can't ping the other computer, not can i ping it from other computers
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	ozzloy		but ifconfig on that computer shows an ip
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	ozzloy		not sure what to do now.  how do i troubleshoot this from here?
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	are you pinging using hostnames, or ip?
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	ip
2008-09-18T02:33:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	well internally i'm pinging ips, but i also tried google.com
2008-09-18T02:34:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	dns is not working. looks like that particular computer is not connected to the network
2008-09-18T02:34:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	no, i said i couldn't even ping ips
2008-09-18T02:35:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	there is no reason why you can't ping local network IPs unless that particular computer is not connected to the network, or the routing table is messed up
2008-09-18T02:35:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	kk, so ifdown eth0; ifup eth0 then?
2008-09-18T02:35:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	try it
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	ifup eth0 is taking forever
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	check your network connections
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	it looks like you can't even renew your IP. are you using dhcp?
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	kk
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	no, requesting a specific ip.  but this was working for the past couple months
2008-09-18T02:38:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	gateway down?
2008-09-18T02:38:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	this computer is on the same network
2008-09-18T02:38:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	so i think that means no
2008-09-18T02:39:00.000Z	ozzloy	daklan	though this one is connected through wireless
2008-09-18T02:39:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	wiring might be to blame. switch to dhcp and see if it grabs an IP
2008-09-18T02:44:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	np
2008-09-18T02:44:00.000Z	daklan	ozzloy	must be a faulty switch
