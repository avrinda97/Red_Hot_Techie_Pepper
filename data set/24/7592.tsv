2006-01-09T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 well.. i just got here.. so i dont know what the question even was.
2006-01-09T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 and whats your system specs?
2006-01-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 the live cd does not use the hard drive at all.
2006-01-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 its a Centrino Processor?
2006-01-09T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 the live cd's have a dozen+ boot options that can work around problems. I find the Ubuntu live cd's to be not as 'good' as say Knoppix in some ways
2006-01-09T10:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 may want to check the Ubuntu wiki and forums and try the 'noapci' and 'noapic' options also.
2006-01-09T10:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 'search' the forums for similer make/models..  theres a laptop discussion formum
2006-01-09T10:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 my guess.. apci, and or apic issues.. hence the suggestion to try 'noapic' and 'noapic'
2006-01-09T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 tack the 3 of them together..
2006-01-09T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 no comma. :P just put them all 3 together
2006-01-09T10:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 at the initial boot item . you entered somthning like 'ubuntu nopcmcia' dident you?
2006-01-09T11:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 ftp://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/knoppix/knoppix-cheatcodes.txt
2006-01-09T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 may want to try the   'noapic nolapic acpi=off vga=771'  options - that seems to be reccomended on the live cd forums..
2006-01-09T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	monkey050	 theres several dozen options that may or may not be needed
