2007-03-06T16:34:00.000Z	poquedoraqu		No one has helped me more than people on his group, so now i come with hope in my heart to ask for help with my new homemade computer O.O *starry eyes* any people know hardware stuff?
2007-03-06T16:36:00.000Z	poquedoraqu		whats it mean when you try to turn on a (new) computer, and the fans and lights run, but the drives dont open and the screen stays off?
2007-03-06T16:36:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	you haven't connected the monitor?
2007-03-06T16:36:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	: Its in there
2007-03-06T16:37:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	eh.. what else to look for.. broken graphics card?
2007-03-06T16:37:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	I dunno, I thiink its fine. I just got it. its a Radeon X700 512MB PCIe w/DVI/TV-OUT
2007-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	the cable to the monitor is broken.. or something else on the motherboard is broken..
2007-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Could it be the processor badly installed?
2007-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	most computers will do something on screen when started.. try switching monitors, if you have another
2007-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	yes.. that could do that
2007-03-06T16:38:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Because i was really confused installing it.
2007-03-06T16:39:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Any way to check?
2007-03-06T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	but then the computer usually beeps and makes all kinds of noises
2007-03-06T16:39:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Oh... that didnt happen
2007-03-06T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	hmm.. no easy ones.. I'd take it out.. read the manual.. check that all the little pins are ok.. apply thermal grease put it back and see if it works
2007-03-06T16:40:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Do AMD 64s work with Radeon X700s okay?
2007-03-06T16:40:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	second option is..... ,I'm guessing you're a guy, find a friendly computer geek.. buy him pizza if he fixes your computer.. if female.. do same.. but you wont have to buy pizza ;)
2007-03-06T16:40:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	I haven't heard of any such problems..
2007-03-06T16:41:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	lol ;)
2007-03-06T16:41:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Im a guy. Well, what about the fact that my board's an nforce?
2007-03-06T16:41:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	I think it would still start... you'd get some kind of error message.. or beeps
2007-03-06T16:42:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	you could check the memory too.. I don't think the computer will boot without memory
2007-03-06T16:42:00.000Z	poquedoraqu	Slart	Well i put memory in... well thanks
2007-03-06T16:43:00.000Z	Slart	poquedoraqu	you're welcome.. good luck
