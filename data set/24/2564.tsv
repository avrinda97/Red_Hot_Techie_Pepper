2009-04-24T02:27:00.000Z	victorh		hi! i have installed the vncserver. But i've find out that there is a server which cames with ubuntu, and works better for my friend. but i can't use it 'cause the vncserver have messed everything. how can i get the previous configuration of the server which came with ubuntu?
2009-04-24T02:27:00.000Z	victorh		i would like to restore the configuration of server which came with ubuntu...
2009-04-24T02:28:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	they should be independent. the built in can be enabled under the settings (desktop sharing)
2009-04-24T02:29:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	it was i though. but i was testing it, and the pc that i've installed vncserver via apt-get, the Remote Desktop does not work with i don't run the command "vncserver" to create it...
2009-04-24T02:31:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	vncserver runs a separate virtual desktop usually accessible as <yourhostname>:1 etc. while the built in desktop sharing in ubuntu exports the current screen under :0
2009-04-24T02:32:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	right. but when i try to connect to the server, it gives that the connection was closed.
2009-04-24T02:33:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	and, in other computers i does not happen
2009-04-24T02:33:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	note that some server refuse connections from localhost. you try to connect from other servers?
2009-04-24T02:34:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	yes, i tried. in other servers the connection worked... =/
2009-04-24T02:35:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	i was wondering if i should remove everything of vncserver, and try to restart the config of remote desktop
2009-04-24T02:36:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	oh, i runned the apt-get autoremove and some vnc was removed. maybe it can work now...
2009-04-24T02:37:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	i'll try
2009-04-24T02:41:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	do you know where the config files of remote desktop are hidden?
2009-04-24T02:42:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	they are in the gnome registry, run gconf-editor
2009-04-24T02:43:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	then head to /desktop/gnome/remote_access in gconf-editor
2009-04-24T02:46:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	everything is ok.. =/
2009-04-24T02:47:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	i'll keep trying
2009-04-24T02:47:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	 are you sude that it's not just the client that fails? have you tried the (thight)vncviewer command line tool?
2009-04-24T02:48:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	hmm, no
2009-04-24T02:48:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	how do i do it?
2009-04-24T02:52:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	what i need to do a connection between two computers?
2009-04-24T02:53:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	maybe it's missing some packages, or something.
2009-04-24T02:54:00.000Z	victorh	zsquareplusc	i'm trying to connect to my own computer, but it does not work
2009-04-24T02:54:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	victorh	the built in desktop sharing might refuse connections form the local computer yes (as it is sharing the screen you are looking at). the vncserver on the other hand should allow these
