2010-07-01T21:11:00.000Z	vijay	ikonia	when i selected option to install after some time i got a message that a unrecoverable error occured and it is taking me to desktop session
2010-07-01T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	vijay	it sounds to me that either your CD is bad - or your machine has a hardware issue, the obvious thing to check is the CD
2010-07-01T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	vijay	check the ISO md5 sums, i they match do a reburn to make sure the CD is "ok"
2010-07-01T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	vijay	occasionally the installer can fail for smaller issues, in which case try to re-run the installer
2010-07-01T21:15:00.000Z	vijay	ikonia	so have you checked md5 sum
2010-07-01T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	vijay	have I? ??? oerrr, it's your CD / iso image
2010-07-01T21:20:00.000Z	vijay	ikonia	have you windows installed?
2010-07-01T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	vijay	no
