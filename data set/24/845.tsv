2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	Arachon		Does anyone have any experience with Déjà Dup?
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	I have some experiences with it, yes.
2011-03-10T23:11:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	I'm trying to restore a backup, but it seems to have gotten stuck on "checking for backups"... Either that or I'm being impatient
2011-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Hmm. Run htop, see if it's acting up.
2011-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	This never occured to me. It's very straightforward app.
2011-03-10T23:12:00.000Z	Arachon		'htop'?
2011-03-10T23:13:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	htop, or Run "ps -aux | grep deja" -- Whatever the dejadup command is.
2011-03-10T23:13:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	Ok... What am I looking for?
2011-03-10T23:13:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	See if RAM or CPU is really high, that's it.
2011-03-10T23:14:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Are you trying to restore a large backup? If so, that may be the reason.
2011-03-10T23:14:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	Doesn't seem so, no
2011-03-10T23:15:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	How long have it been?
2011-03-10T23:15:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	I'd say... about 25 minutes
2011-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Okay. Clearly something happened. It shouldn't really take that long. Different versions?
2011-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	Nope, same version
2011-03-10T23:16:00.000Z	Arachon		I just did a reinstall
2011-03-10T23:18:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Meh. Can't say much. It's dead simple for me. Create. Restore. That's it.
2011-03-10T23:18:00.000Z	Arachon		Strange...
2011-03-10T23:18:00.000Z	Arachon		I'm also attempting to do it over the network, maybe that's why?
2011-03-10T23:19:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Ah. I never did it. I create it on the machine. Scp over the files.
2011-03-10T23:19:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Also, I like the last comment. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dj-dup-perfect-linux-backup-software/
2011-03-10T23:20:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	That was... Informative...
2011-03-10T23:21:00.000Z	red2kic	Arachon	Get the files on the machine. See if it works better. I always hate the idea of bits getting lost over the network backup.
2011-03-10T23:21:00.000Z	Arachon	red2kic	Yeah, I'll try that
