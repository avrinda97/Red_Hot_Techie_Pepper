2007-03-12T13:18:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	does it still load things even though the color doesn't show up?
2007-03-12T13:18:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Yeah it does
2007-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	but it looks weird and funky and I'm not liking it
2007-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Anyway to fix that problem?
2007-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	maybe changing the theme could help.
2007-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Well it did not do this when I installed it on my laptop
2007-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	I'll give that a try
2007-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Alright changing the theme fixed the problem
2007-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Thank you for your help  :)
2007-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	I'm guessing it's some kind of minor bug
2007-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Yeah maybe, i'm installing the 915resolution thing to make my resolution 1280x800
2007-03-12T13:43:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	that means you have a new kernel installed.
2007-03-12T13:44:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	on linux, you have the option to use older kernels in case the newest kernel has problems.
2007-03-12T13:44:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	but I've never had any problems with the updated kernels on ubuntu so I just pick the option on top in grub.
2007-03-12T13:44:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Oh that explains it
2007-03-12T13:45:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	Thanks, your quite the helper today :) along with everyone else of course
2007-03-12T13:45:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	you can remove those older kernels from grup by adding # before those lines in grub.conf
2007-03-12T13:45:00.000Z	TheVault	nomin	I think I will do that
2007-03-12T13:48:00.000Z	nomin	TheVault	you can do anything on linux that you can on windows except games, although I have gotten some games to work using cedega.
