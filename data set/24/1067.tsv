2010-09-19T00:26:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	is the monitor connected?
2010-09-19T00:26:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	what videocard are you using?
2010-09-19T00:26:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	yes - it;s svideo not crt or lcd
2010-09-19T00:27:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	still xrandr should detect it
2010-09-19T00:27:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	dont know
2010-09-19T00:27:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	yes getting that now
2010-09-19T00:28:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	problem - i am on a windows machine now because ubuntu m/c not on net yet
2010-09-19T00:28:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	i can see output though - what should i look for
2010-09-19T00:29:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	doesnt seem to mention any video card - it's a fujitsu amilo laptop with the standard card
2010-09-19T00:29:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	do you see multiple inputs or is it something like this http://pastebin.com/hnk11cPS
2010-09-19T00:29:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	run lspci | grep VGA, that should tell you what videocard you're using
2010-09-19T00:31:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	says ... VGA compatible controller: intel corp. 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE chipset inte graphh dev rev 03
2010-09-19T00:32:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	also checked under drivers and it said it wasnt running any proprietrary drivers
2010-09-19T00:34:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	hm, intel should be ok.
2010-09-19T00:35:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	what about glxinfo | grep -i direct do you get DirectRendering Yes?
2010-09-19T00:36:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	direct rendering yes but it says get fences failed : -1
2010-09-19T00:37:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	hm, something is not right. if you could pastebin the entire output of glxinfo that would be great
2010-09-19T00:38:00.000Z	rainrain	usser	i will log off this mc and get the amilo on the net and log back on
2010-09-19T00:46:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	hm looks ok, did you try plugging it the external monitor and restarting xorg?
2010-09-19T00:46:00.000Z	usser	rainrain	sometimes it doesnt detect it until you restart x server
