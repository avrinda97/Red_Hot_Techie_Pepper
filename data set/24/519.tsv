2012-05-19T18:53:00.000Z	gccster		guys i just installed ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop intel i5 with nvidia gforce 540M the problem is that the fan cpu speed is always very high and this is not normal can anybody help?
2012-05-19T18:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	(not specific to your issue) if you have lm-sensors installed, from a terminal does "sensors" return a value for CPU FAN Speed in RPM?
2012-05-19T18:57:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	i installed lm-sensors what do u want me to do
2012-05-19T18:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	in a terminal type "sensors"

2012-05-19T19:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	could you pastebin "lscpi -v | grep -i vga" for me?
2012-05-19T19:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	no package required?
2012-05-19T19:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	if it's too much trouble - don't worry about it!  thanks anyway.

2012-05-19T19:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	thanks!  ActionParsnip so lspci with the -v will show both cards - no sudo or lshw required.
2012-05-19T19:07:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	is there any chance to fix this?
2012-05-19T19:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	get it working you mean?  ya.  (i've never had this h/w so don't really know the specifics) but you need to install bumblebee and or research more on nvidia-optimus support in linux
2012-05-19T19:09:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	im sure its hardware acceleration problem
2012-05-19T19:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	i think, once you have bumblebee properly working the nvidia driver starts to work properly (ie acceleration)
2012-05-19T19:10:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	where can i find bubmblebe?
2012-05-19T19:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	no idea ;)
2012-05-19T19:11:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	do u know what is it?
2012-05-19T19:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	sorry i've shared all i know about hybrid graphics with you already - so good luck.  someone else who knows more would be able to help you better.
2012-05-19T19:12:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	ok thanx for anyone needs it i found IT https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
2012-05-19T19:25:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	well i installed bumblebee is there any test where i can see if h/w acceleration is turned on?
2012-05-19T19:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	i have no idea about your hardware - you now know more then me ;)  good luck man.
2012-05-19T19:26:00.000Z	gccster	zykotick9	sorry if i am a pain in the ass i didnt asked you about the hardware just any tests to check out the acceleration....
2012-05-19T19:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	gccster	ya, i'm not to sure what test apply for hybrid stuff sorry.  does nvidia-settings work correctly (i have no idea if it should or shouldn't)?
