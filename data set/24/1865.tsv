2009-07-24T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	mount the partiton then run: du -R *
2009-08-24T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	you need to either use sudo cp or if you mount the usb properly your user will have writability. You already have read access to the logs as a user
2009-08-24T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	can you provide the output of:   mount; sudo fdisk -l
2009-08-24T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	use a pastebin to output all of the output
2009-08-24T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	they are terminal commands
2009-08-24T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	you can use sudo to gain eevated access, if you prefer gui then use: gksudo nautilus
2009-08-24T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	you would be far better off mounting the usb properly but you havent given me the info i asked for
2009-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	sup
2009-08-24T11:56:00.000Z	bernardlychan	ActionParsnip	hey!! ok... so i've plugged in my usb... and now i have to copy the var/log folder
2009-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	can you please provide the output of: mount; sudo fdisk -l
2009-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	i'll make it easy for you
2009-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	sudo apt-get install pastebinit; mount > ~/temp.gfgf; sudo fdisk -l >> ~/temp.gfgf; pastebinit ~/temp.gfgf; rm ~/temp.gfgf
2009-08-24T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	whats the last line in the lount command say?
2009-08-24T12:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	that will fail as its the wrong mount point, your usb partition isnt mount to /media/disk
2009-08-24T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	mount    will tell you
2009-08-24T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	its something like /media/BCHAN  or something
2009-08-24T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	last line
2009-09-03T12:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	or unzip the files to home then sudo cp them
2009-09-03T12:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	no you NEVER log on as root
2009-09-23T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bernardlychan	you can convert the img to iso
2009-09-23T12:43:00.000Z	bernardlychan	ActionParsnip	dw.. i'll google... ty
