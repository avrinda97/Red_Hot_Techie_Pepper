2008-02-29T11:17:00.000Z	fanin		my laptop wont boot from cd even if it is set as first boot order in bios.. can someone help me?
2008-02-29T11:18:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	if you have to do livecd install,what about you try a external cd drive
2008-02-29T11:19:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	i dont have one :/
2008-02-29T11:19:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	what is wrong with your cd drive?why does it not boot
2008-02-29T11:21:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	no idea.. it just says GRUB something (can't remember).. i think it works fine, just wont boot
2008-02-29T11:22:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	you put that cd in drive ,if it is right,choose that livecd install,the first one,
2008-02-29T11:24:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	i'm trying to install windoze on this one.. ubuntu works fine on it though
2008-02-29T11:24:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	ok here you go

2008-02-29T11:27:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	just wondering what you mean.. "here you go"?
2008-02-29T11:28:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	i mean you can go to windows ,if you don't like linux
2008-02-29T11:29:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	i love linux but i have two other machines with ubuntu.. i just want to know how i can get the boot thing to work
2008-02-29T11:29:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	what boot thing
2008-02-29T11:31:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	the boot order (first floppy, second CD, third HD) sorry i'm a total noob :)
2008-02-29T11:31:00.000Z	fanin	icesword	i set CD as first but it makes no difference
2008-02-29T11:31:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	are you wondering about setting bios,choose the boot order
2008-02-29T11:32:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	did you save you set
2008-02-29T11:33:00.000Z	icesword		!irc > icesword
2008-02-29T11:34:00.000Z	fanin		i know how to set the boot order in BIOS and i did save it.. but it still wont work.. so, i was wondering if there where some other Ubuntu settings for doing so (hope you understand) :/
2008-02-29T11:35:00.000Z	icesword	fanin	sorry,that is it all,all of modern computers are the same,unless your cd is bad
2008-02-29T11:37:00.000Z	fanin		darn.. just checking if there was something different with ubuntu.. like i said im a total noob at it :)
