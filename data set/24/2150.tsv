2009-04-09T05:28:00.000Z	rdumas		is anyone having internet issues
2009-04-09T05:29:00.000Z	rdumas		sometimes it works and sometimes it dont
2009-04-09T05:31:00.000Z	rdumas		has anybody seen the new ubuntu 9.4 yet
2009-04-09T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	of course been using it
2009-04-09T05:32:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	how do I do that
2009-04-09T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	don't get it yet
2009-04-09T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	wait for the release, well a bit after the April 23rd release date,  some good reviews,  and do clean install with Ext4
2009-04-09T05:33:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	yea but how is it, when it is released will it be worth it
2009-04-09T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	probably not,  except for Ext4
2009-04-09T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	,but Ext4 still has some issues I think, and may not be worth it in your case
2009-04-09T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	new file system
2009-04-09T05:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	your new to Ubuntu?
2009-04-09T05:35:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	yes fairly new
2009-04-09T05:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	you can upgrade and do 9.04 on Ext3, but then you won't get the  faster file system,  and can only get partial Ext4 suppourt in  Ext3
2009-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	to be honest 9.10 does not seem worth it,  except for Ext4
2009-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	8.10 and 8.04 are good enough really
2009-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	well I have 8.10 and it is working well, so I think I will hold off
2009-04-09T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	9.04 I meant
2009-04-09T05:38:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	the only problem I have is intermittent Internet
2009-04-09T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	what you mean  intermittent internet?
2009-04-09T05:41:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	sometimes it will work for a long time, and sometimes it take 4 or 5 times to get it to work
2009-04-09T05:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rdumas	wireless?
2009-04-09T05:41:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	yes wireless, but my mail and pidgin keep working all the time
2009-04-09T05:42:00.000Z	rdumas	sebsebseb	yes wireless
