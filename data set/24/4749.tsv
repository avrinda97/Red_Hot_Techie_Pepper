2007-01-18T07:00:00.000Z	Baloogan		Hello people. I need help getting my ubuntu computer to get wireless internets from a windows computer with encryption.
2007-01-18T07:00:00.000Z	Baloogan		first I want to get wireless working sans encrypting
2007-01-18T07:00:00.000Z	Baloogan		and I'm unable.
2007-01-18T07:01:00.000Z	Baloogan		Someone please help me :(
2007-01-18T07:02:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	There's a TON of posts on wireless networking in Ubuntu at the forums...  I use wired, myself, I wish I could help you otherwise :/
2007-01-18T07:03:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I theorize it's just one of those topics that's too involved, and too broadly covered already...
2007-01-18T07:03:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	could you link me to some of these things?
2007-01-18T07:04:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	could you atleast tell me how to set what dns server my computer uses?

2007-01-18T07:05:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	I just pinged my server by ip... my problem seems to be setting of the dns server now :3
2007-01-18T07:05:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I'm afraid I can't; not if you're trying to access the internet through another computer
2007-01-18T07:05:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I may have something, hold on, I saved it for when I need to use it =)
2007-01-18T07:06:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=119787 Dunno if it's what you need, but it's a good starting point, I'm sure
2007-01-18T07:07:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	It uses a lot of gui-type user friendly stuff
2007-01-18T07:07:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I feel ya =)
2007-01-18T07:08:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	My wireless seems fine right now. its encrypted and such but I don't know how to set the dns server :(
2007-01-18T07:09:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	Well, I remember setting my dns servers somewhere, lemme poke around
2007-01-18T07:11:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	All I can think of is in etc/network/interfaces
2007-01-18T07:12:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	found it :3 its /etc/resolv.conf
2007-01-18T07:13:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	Cool, in retrospect I remember setting it up when I was trying to get my DHCP server going, so even if I found that file, I don't think it would help you as a client...
2007-01-18T07:13:00.000Z	Baloogan	adamonline	I'm a BIG fan of static networks
2007-01-18T07:13:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I would be too, but I've got a house full of WinXP noobs and the occastional guest
2007-01-18T07:14:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	I wish I could have static IPs in my room, at least, so I could securely open the ports I want to enable at the router without having my ip change =(
2007-01-18T07:16:00.000Z	adamonline	Baloogan	That's why I needed to serve DHCP from my Ubuntu box, to appease the others
