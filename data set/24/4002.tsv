2009-01-28T02:24:00.000Z	chetnick		hi, does anybody know what is that web browser, it says mozilla but it is not firefox. I think i saw it on backtrack.
2009-01-28T02:24:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	seamonkey?
2009-01-28T02:25:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	vigo: i found that one, but it says it is "all-in-one application formerly known as the "Mozilla Application Suite"
2009-01-28T02:25:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	right. remember Mozilla was a browser and it had an html editor and a mail client built in?
2009-01-28T02:25:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	that became Seamonkey
2010-05-04T00:59:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	file a bug
2010-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	are you the one that i told to file a bug earlier today?
2010-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	yeah.
2010-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	you just have to wait for the bug to be fixed
2010-05-04T09:19:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	i dont think it's a bug. By the way i read the rules for filling the bug, and i dont meet the requirements.
2010-05-04T09:19:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	"dont meet the requirements"?
2010-05-04T09:21:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	what do you mean you dont meet the requirements to file a bug?
2010-05-04T09:22:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	you need to be able to reproduce condition, and some other stuff i read today.
2010-05-04T09:22:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	does it consistently Not Work?
2010-05-04T09:22:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	if so: reproducible
2010-05-04T09:23:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	i think what they meant is, get working system, and hibernate again, if it doesn't work ... then file a bug. I will try to file a bug, and see what happens.
2010-05-04T09:23:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	im a developer ;-) i know what they mean
2010-05-04T09:24:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	because the hardware varies from system to system, trying it on some random other system and finding diffrent behaviour doesnt make it not-reproducible
2010-05-04T09:25:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	if your installed system and a live cd behave the same, it verifies that its a bug and not "chetnick was screwing around and messed up the configuration" which makes it perfectly valid for you to file
2010-05-04T09:26:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	there was a bug filled for sound not working after coming out of hibernation. But after reboot sound is back. My completly broke.
2010-05-04T09:26:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	i dont care what /other/ bugs are filed. as i said, hardware varies.  what about *your* bug?
2010-05-04T09:52:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	i filled a bug.
2010-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	maco	chetnick	bug number?
2010-05-04T09:53:00.000Z	chetnick	maco	Bug #574918
