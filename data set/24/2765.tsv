2008-08-26T08:10:00.000Z	pjshooter		hi - I've got a rig with dual core E4600 and 4G ram. I want to run a virtual machine on 8.04 64 bit to host winxp (32 bit). My cpu does not support hardware virt. Any recommendations as to what type of vm I should be running to get a) full functionality (sound, network) and b) decent speed?
2008-08-26T08:10:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	you *sure* that CPU doesn't have the virt extensions? have you checked cpuinfo?
2008-08-26T08:11:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	yes, sorry to say. Even Intel has a nice red X under that column
2008-08-26T08:11:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	how did you check?
2008-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	egrep '^flags.*(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo    >> no output
2008-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	try --  egrep 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
2008-08-26T08:13:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	so then Virtualbox or VMware
2008-08-26T08:13:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	QEMU is software-only emulation. not virtualization.
2008-08-26T08:14:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	any pref's re. virt.box or vmware?
2008-08-26T08:14:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	v-box is less expensive. :)
2008-08-26T08:15:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	what do you need Windows to do?
2008-08-26T08:15:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	drive my canon printer, run tax software
2008-08-26T08:15:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	WINE won't run the tax software?
2008-08-26T08:16:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	and printers? you serious? for what they cost, just buy another and sell the Canon.
2008-08-26T08:16:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	never tried, to be honest.  I also do the occasional MS Excel programming, so....
2008-08-26T08:17:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	I know, I know  :(
2008-08-26T08:17:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	i think a new printer and WINE is what you want to try before mucking with VMs.
2008-08-26T08:17:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	<fake anger> damn you! </fake anger>
2008-08-26T08:19:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	Thx for time - I'll go and read about quicktax under wine
2008-08-26T08:19:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	you in .ca?
2008-08-26T08:20:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	yes
2008-08-26T08:21:00.000Z	pjshooter	mneptok	'the Peg, Manitoba
2008-08-26T08:24:00.000Z	mneptok	pjshooter	see PM, pweez.
