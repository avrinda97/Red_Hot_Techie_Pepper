2005-12-18T13:00:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	can you login on the text console?
2005-12-18T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	are you short of diskspace? (df)
2005-12-18T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	look at your $HOME/.xsession-errors to see if there is a clue
2005-12-18T13:14:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	have you looked at .xsession-errors like I asked you to?
2005-12-18T13:15:00.000Z	pagux	soundray	nothing all kde related errors
2005-12-18T13:16:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	that is not the way to trace the error you're seeing.
2005-12-18T13:17:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	restart gdm, run a tail on .xsession-errors in the text console, then switch to gdm and login. When it hangs, look at the tail of .xsession-errors.
2005-12-18T13:17:00.000Z	pagux	soundray	I am using kdm not gdm
2005-12-18T13:18:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	but you're trying to start Gnome? Same procedure then.
2005-12-18T13:19:00.000Z	pagux	soundray	shoudi remove My esiting x sessio errors file then
2005-12-18T13:19:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	no, unnecessary. In the text console, run 'tail -f $HOME/.xsession-errors'
2005-12-18T13:20:00.000Z	pagux	soundray	I will be back ;-)
2005-12-18T13:21:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	good luck.
2005-12-20T12:04:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	you can install xubuntu. The boot screen is nice and blue after that...
2005-12-20T12:07:00.000Z	pagux	soundray	no thanks i like gnome
2005-12-20T12:18:00.000Z	soundray	pagux	wasn't there once a Linux distro for girls? With a fortune db displaying beauty tips on login?
