2007-02-06T17:55:00.000Z	qos		hey guys ... i have succesfully established a vpn connection to my university. know i wants to gets routed all traffic throught that tunnel ... but how do i define the route?
2007-02-06T17:55:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	# man route
2007-02-06T17:56:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	thanks for the tip ... but my question wasn't how to open the manpage ...
2007-02-06T17:56:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	i know the man page will yell you how to define the route
2007-02-06T17:57:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	type route show, see the * thats the default gateway just change that to what ever the gateway is on your VPN
2007-02-06T17:58:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	its via pptp ...
2007-02-06T17:58:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	i see... D'Oh
2007-02-06T17:59:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	i cant remember if there's a way to change the "default" interface
2007-02-06T06:01:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	u are too fast for me. i have a normal internet connection (with a router) at home. but know, i want to connect to my university via pptp (i got i running with a new device ppp0). so, the last step is to route all traffic over ppp0 ... a already add a new gw but it didn't changed anything ...
2007-02-06T06:03:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	 2 sec
2007-02-06T06:03:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	dont hurry, be happy :)
2007-02-06T06:03:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	hehe i am happy ;)
2007-02-06T06:03:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	but anyway, what you need to do
2007-02-06T06:03:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	theres a way to set the default INTERFACE using route
2007-02-06T06:04:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	i cant remember what command that is
2007-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	problem is that when i change the default route i kill my ptpp connection because it runs over the old route.
2007-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	thats a pain in the ass im must admit, maybe use a firewall to redirect traffic?
2007-02-06T06:12:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	FYI i'm reading about default routes, pptp apparently creates its own default route so it *should* automatically go over the VPN
2007-02-06T06:15:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	but i does not ... i am using no proxy and i still have to same ip address ... i should have one of the university ones ... i am sure the tunnel gets created. no errors at all and i can ping one of our internal university servers.
2007-02-06T06:16:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	does your Uni have proxy servers
2007-02-06T06:16:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	sure
2007-02-06T06:16:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	try using one of their proxy servers
2007-02-06T06:17:00.000Z	Occasus	qos	your uni's that is
2007-02-06T06:17:00.000Z	qos	Occasus	instead of using vpn/pptp?
