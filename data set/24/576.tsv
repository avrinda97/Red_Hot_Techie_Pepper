2011-06-09T00:37:00.000Z	ttwhy		Hi, i have a strange problem with my wlan. it connect 3 times to my wlan router, and disconnects after a couple of minutes all connections
2011-06-09T00:37:00.000Z	ttwhy		but i only have one configured connection
2011-06-09T00:38:00.000Z	ttwhy		uodate my firmware?
2011-06-09T00:39:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	if you gor access to your router then reset it
2011-06-09T00:40:00.000Z	ttwhy	EncRyptO	on the router side?
2011-06-09T00:41:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	yes
2011-06-09T00:42:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	the reason i say is because i dont know what network you have or how many computers you got connected to the ap
2011-06-09T00:43:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	someone could be deauthenticating you
2011-06-09T00:43:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	bumping you off that ap
2011-06-09T00:43:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	chipset in card or computer?
2011-06-09T00:44:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	meaning internal or external chipset
2011-06-09T00:45:00.000Z	ttwhy	EncRyptO	its a rtl8192ce crap onboard laptop chipset
2011-06-09T00:46:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	are you connecting to a secured or unsecured ap?
2011-06-09T00:46:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	because you can try to run dhclient from the command line to connect
2011-06-09T00:47:00.000Z	ttwhy	EncRyptO	i will try that
2011-06-09T00:47:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	dhclient wlan0      .... whatever your winterface is.
2011-06-09T00:48:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	I suppose the iwconfig already has the essid set to whatever the routers broadcast name is
2011-06-09T00:49:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	so dhclient wlan0   ....that should connect if not then run ifconfig wlan0 down
2011-06-09T00:49:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	then ifconfig wlan0 up
2011-06-09T00:49:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	then try to connect again
2011-06-09T00:50:00.000Z	ttwhy	EncRyptO	dhclient wlan0 gets the same ip, without delay
2011-06-09T00:50:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	so it works now?
2011-06-09T00:51:00.000Z	ttwhy	EncRyptO	atm it works
2011-06-09T00:52:00.000Z	EncRyptO	ttwhy	 ok,
