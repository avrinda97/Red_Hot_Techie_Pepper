2008-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	starz		thus the server install to keep the bloat to a minimum
2008-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	starz		also you should consider fluxbuntu
2008-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	starz		fluxbox is quite light, or perhaps icewm
2008-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	starz		np
2008-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	starz		bullgard4,
2008-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	starz		how long has it been since you updated ?
2008-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	starz		1 week or so?
2008-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	starz		there were a lot of updates, like openoffice and kernels and whatnot.
2008-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	No. Since a day before yesterday.
2008-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	like i said there have been a lot of updates - i would look at the update manager at the packages its going to install before doing so
2008-06-21T13:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	Please read again what I asked. I'd like to know why Ubuntu made so many changes.
2008-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	I did not ask how many you have. Please read again the question which I have put here.
2008-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	ive answered your question twice
2008-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	lets do it a different way ok?
2008-06-21T13:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	Thank you very much.
2008-06-21T13:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	Yes, I did.
2008-06-21T13:14:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	o good your still here too
2008-06-21T13:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	Why do you ask me to do that? I usually do operations in that area using Synaptic.
2008-06-21T13:18:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	i want it to make sense to you
2008-06-21T13:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	I have done the operation which you are asking me for, just yesterday. I will not repeat it today.
2008-06-21T13:19:00.000Z	starz	bullgard4	see this is the problem
2008-06-21T13:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	starz	Yes.
