2007-12-04T00:26:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	hey
2007-12-04T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	hmm can u be more specific?
2007-12-04T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	ok so what do u suggest?
2007-12-04T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	its my first exprience with linux :p so be gentle
2007-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Well I would either suggest you get the text mode installer.. or choose another Linux..
2007-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	what is the "text mode" installer?
2007-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	No offense to anyone in here, but Ubuntu is one of the more 'full-featured' distros - and 1.6gb will not cut it
2007-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	and what other linux do u suggest?
2007-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Go to ubuntu - alternative
2007-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	i have another HDD, with 1.3GB which makes3GB which should be enough :P
2007-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	I would recommend Archlinux.. for your disk size.. but you said your a newbie so... it may be a little too much
2007-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	No... you have to have at least 2gb on the one drive
2007-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	yeah im newbie... yeah i got that, but u said i can install from "text" something..
2007-12-04T00:30:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Yes ubuntu.com --- 'alternative CD'
2007-12-04T00:30:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	my question is, when im done installing it and all, how much space it will take?
2007-12-04T00:31:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	www.vectorlinux.com - try that.. you MAY be able to work with that
2007-12-04T00:32:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	hmm i dun need something from programers :P
2007-12-04T00:32:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	No vector is pretty easy ...
2007-12-04T00:33:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	anyway u said something about alternative.. how much space will it take later?
2007-12-04T00:33:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Depending on what you choose
2007-12-04T00:34:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	can i choose what to install or not to?
2007-12-04T00:34:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Somethings yes, some things no ...
2007-12-04T00:35:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Thurin1	ok thx u guys, ill try alternative CD and the puppy (yes?)
2007-12-04T00:35:00.000Z	Thurin1	ubuntu__	Errr i'd stay away from puppy linux.. try Vectorlinux instead
