2009-09-26T02:11:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx		hey is there any repositories for the kernel 2.6.30????
2009-09-26T02:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	no, but there's a ppa for later kernel, why do you want it?
2009-09-26T02:12:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	u know the url?? intel graphics issues
2009-09-26T02:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	installing a newer kernel is unlikely to sot out your Intel graphics card issue
2009-09-26T02:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	sort out above
2009-09-26T02:14:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	 aactually ive installed it by hand....... but i want repos... so thats why im asking if any one knows any repos for kernel updates... dont remember the ppa?
2009-09-26T02:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	a kernel ppa won't fix your Intel graphics card issues
2009-09-26T02:15:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	it does
2009-10-02T04:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	same here I woudn't recommend that
2009-10-02T04:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	Why do you want a later kernel? Which version of Ubuntu?
2009-10-02T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	Runs better in what way?
2009-10-02T04:13:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	graphics, everything... boot time is faster...
2009-10-02T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	You did Ext4?
2009-10-02T04:14:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	ext3
2009-10-02T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	hmm interesting kind of
2009-10-02T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	well  Ext4 is default  for 9.10  released on October 29th, and  it has Ext4 by default, not for upgrades though,  and yes with Ext4 boot up is rather fast and that,  plus  9.10 will have a pretty recant kernel
2009-10-02T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	using a kernel that isn't from the repo, is a little dodgy I guess
2009-10-02T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	Ext3 upgrades above
2009-10-02T04:16:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	ive tried 9.10 alpha something... because of the kernel that it had, but i went back to 9.04 and installed 2.6.30 kernel manually, then 2.6.32 and it runs really really good
2009-10-02T04:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	You went back to 9.04, but didn't do Ext4 hmm,   as far as I know it's Ext4 that speeds things up,  and of course 9.10 was crashy it wasn't a final
2009-10-02T04:18:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	MenZa i dont know... WHY--- i just know i have an intel x3100 video card, it was really really poor performance in 2.6.28 but with this kernel everything is running so so much better....
2009-10-02T04:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	ok well Ext4 also speeds things up :)
2009-10-02T04:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucaxxxxxx	,but that's got nothing to do with your Intel graphics card
2009-10-02T04:20:00.000Z	lucaxxxxxx	sebsebseb	sure it doesnt... hehe
