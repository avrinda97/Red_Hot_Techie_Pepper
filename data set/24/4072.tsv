2007-07-21T11:21:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1		I have an ATI radeon Xpress 1100, is anti-aliasing supported in ubuntu?
2007-07-21T11:21:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1		or anyway to enable it?
2007-07-21T11:21:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	it is supported, probably already enabled... you can change to add subpixel rendering if you want it to be cooler still
2007-07-21T11:22:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	I want it to make compiz look nicer and smoother
2007-07-21T11:22:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	#ubuntu-effects, btw, use beryl or compiz fusion :)
2007-07-21T11:23:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	thats what I'm using, fusion
2007-07-21T11:23:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	and your fonts look funny?
2007-07-21T11:23:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	they're fine to me
2007-07-21T11:23:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	I just want the cube to be smoother
2007-07-21T11:24:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	oh, well... that's not so much anti-aliasing
2007-07-21T11:24:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	how so? then what is it that I should do
2007-07-21T11:25:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	get an nvidia or intel ;)  or petition ati/amd to release better drivers... or help the avivo open source ati driver project
2007-07-21T11:25:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	I'm on a laptop
2007-07-21T11:26:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	I hate ATI
2007-07-21T11:30:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	is there any setting manager for ATI cards
2007-07-21T11:30:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	driconf is the only one i know of
2007-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	I want it to look nicer... and I saw anti-aliasing makes it look amazing, so
2007-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	you using fglrx and xgl to get compiz fusion?
2007-07-21T11:31:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	thats what I'm on
2007-07-21T11:33:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	xgl is just slow too... did you search the forums for antialiasing?
2007-07-21T11:33:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	or #ubuntu-effects?
2007-07-21T11:34:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	Its not that its slow, it runs fine. Its just that the lines don't look nice on the cube, as in you can see where the pixels are separating  (hard to explain)
2007-07-21T11:35:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	burner	Its just very very obviously aliased
2007-07-21T11:35:00.000Z	burner	MrGreencastl1	yeah, sorry, got me... I bet it's and upstream compiz issue moreso than anything specific to you
