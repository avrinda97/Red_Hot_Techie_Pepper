2007-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	scorphus		why can't I access apache2 from WAN?
2007-09-20T15:12:00.000Z	scorphus		I've configured the router correctly and iptraff tells me that traffic is coming in on port 80 but apache2 won't respond nor log anything. Help please
2007-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	are you certain your isp allows port 80 traffic?
2007-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	yes, it is a dedicated service with 10 IP addresses
2007-09-20T15:13:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	hosts.deny and hosts.allow perhaps?
2007-09-20T15:14:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	they're empty
2007-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	scorphus		let's wait for KG1987's input
2007-09-20T15:15:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	I'm no expert, just coming up with things I've run into... /etc/init.d/apache2 restart ?
2007-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	ok, just thoughts like that is what I need now... no expert too... trying restart
2007-09-20T15:17:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	timeout
2007-09-20T15:17:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	try start instead of restart
2007-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	told me it is already running, did a stop the start, timeout
2007-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	weird.
2007-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	very, sohuld I do anything different in /etc/hosts ?
2007-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	has it ever worked?
2007-09-20T15:19:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	never, it is brand
2007-09-20T15:19:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	shouldn't be necessary really. ah how did you install it?
2007-09-20T15:19:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	it is ubuntu server, I installed it with apt-get
2007-09-20T15:20:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	apt-get apache2 .. nothing else?
2007-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	in fact it was libapache2-mod-php5, which depends on apache and others...
2007-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	ah... you may want to start over and follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
2007-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	sure, I'll do this
2007-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	scorphus	skarface	thanks a lot for the help and the time you afforded, appreciate that
2007-09-20T15:22:00.000Z	skarface	scorphus	np
