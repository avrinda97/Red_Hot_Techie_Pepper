2007-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	SciOly		I'm using Edgy but I have not automagic "upgrade" button in upgrade-manager, anyone might know why?
2007-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	you need to pass -d to it
2007-04-21T07:04:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	I tried -d, no success
2007-04-21T07:05:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	update-manager -c
2007-04-21T07:18:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	Flannel I remember there is a command that tell you the active version of ubuntu can't recall it's name
2007-04-21T07:18:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	I think cat /etc/issue will tell you what you're running, but that's not what I meant
2007-04-21T07:19:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	Flannel no there is a direct one Flannel may remember that way you will know if it already upgraded or not
2007-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	python -v if it's 2.5 then you are already at 7.04
2007-04-21T07:21:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	nope... lots of libs then 2.4.4c1
2007-04-21T07:22:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	umm then your probably half way thru
2007-04-21T07:22:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	could you check /etc/apt/source.lst does it shows 7.04 repos?
2007-04-21T07:23:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	no edgy repositories
2007-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	err... no 7.04, but edgy respositories
2007-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	ahh so something is wrong there. update-manager -c did anything?
2007-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	but the edgy ones are commented?
2007-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	update-manager -c checked everything but gave no button
2007-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	no... the edgy ones are present, it doesn't say in the directions to comment the edgy ones and add feisty ones...
2007-04-21T07:25:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	no update-manager should take care of that for you, I'll suggest you comment out the edgy ones and try again.
2007-04-21T07:26:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	no
2007-04-21T07:27:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	eh?
2007-04-21T07:27:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	that file has the places to get packages from if you use a very old one you will be telling your system to go back to that state.
2007-04-21T07:28:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	I just meant that I renamed it to some backup to see if it helped, but it actually didn't
2007-04-21T07:28:00.000Z	elpargo	SciOly	Flannel is right it seems to be a more general thing
2007-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	SciOly	elpargo	Flannel, I changed my apt server to the general US one from the official ubuntu one and 13 assorted updates came up in update-amanger, they're installing now and I'll try again after this for a dist upgrade button
