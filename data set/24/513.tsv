2011-07-12T05:18:00.000Z	seanmc98		hello. if i am making ubuntu 11.04 pendrive with a 4gb usb drive can i set a persistant file size for storing changes? if so what size do you suggest?
2011-07-12T05:20:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	I'd say in that case you won't be using the rest of the pen for anything else so I'd take over the entire space
2011-07-12T05:20:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	so how big 1.5gig? or 2gig?
2011-07-12T05:21:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	ALL of it. If you create it with the USB disk creator, there's a bar. Move the bar to the end
2011-07-12T05:22:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	but I find it even better to just install Ubuntu on the USB stick (instead of creating a live USB stick with a persistent file
2011-07-12T05:23:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	how do u go about doin that? i am following the guide according to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
2011-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	oh! Ouch. Sorry, haven't deal with windows in many many years. No idea how to do it. I'd say, burn the iso on a CD. Boot from a CD and during the install steps, when it asks if you want Ubuntu to take the whole disk or to install side by side with windows, choose manual, and install on the USB stick
2011-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	that gives you a small Ubuntu install that you can take anywhere (but it's no good to install on other computers)
2011-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	thats all i want untill i get me own computer
2011-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	so you think you can do those? It's not too hard. I don't know what tool to burn a iso on windows. The ubuntu wiki talked about infrarecorder
2011-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	i already am creating the usb drive
2011-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	am i doing the right steps if i always want to bioot into ubuntu and use it anywhere with the pendrive? or is there a seperate way?
2011-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	I prefer my way. What you did takes (I think) more space and is slower but allows you to install Ubuntu in any computer. Mine doesn't (but boots faster). It's like a normal install but on a hard drive where the size is the same as the USB stick
2011-07-12T05:36:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	then I would install Ubuntu on the USB stick (rather than making a Live USB stick. You'll need a CD with Ubuntu (or another USB stick to use as install)
2011-07-12T05:37:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	i was reading from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ that the way i am doing it will work
2011-07-12T05:38:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	yes. And like I told you, it will. I'm just explaining that there other way, and the difference to it.
2011-07-12T05:43:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	i need your opinion. what is better.. mint or ubuntu?
2011-07-12T05:44:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	I believe that's a matter of taste. I never used mint myself. Seen it once and wasn't impressed
2011-07-12T05:45:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	ubuntu is nice. You may want to try other distros later. Many Linux users are afflicted with distro hoping. I've tried Debian and Arch as well
2011-07-12T05:47:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	hmmm.. yeah. Install on a USB stick then. It should solve your problem
2011-07-12T05:54:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	I believe you can install any Linux on a USB stick and boot from it (different from making a Live USB/CD)
2011-07-12T05:55:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	you can install on the USB stick (as if it was just another HD), or you can make a Live USB (with or without a persistent file). I explained you this 10min ago
2011-07-12T05:57:00.000Z	carandraug	seanmc98	burn the iso on a CD (you already have a Ubuntu CD so this is already done). Boot from the CD and choose to install. During the install steps, when it asks if you want Ubuntu to take the whole disk or to install side by side with windows, choose manual, and install on the USB stick
2011-07-12T06:38:00.000Z	seanmc98	carandraug	i didnt have to boot into ubuntu i can just run and install from windows
