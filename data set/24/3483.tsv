2011-01-27T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	ask in ##hardware   this is ubuntu support
2011-01-27T17:38:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	well, I need a combo for Ubuntu to work on
2011-01-27T17:39:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	i couldn't find 90% of the modern motherboards on there
2011-01-27T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	or buy from companys stating they support Linux
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	errmmm.. this is bangkok
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	so?
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	these people will tell you anything you want to hear
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	"will it make toast".. "sure!! 100%"
2011-01-27T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	instead of looking at the make etc, look at the components on the board to check compatibility
2011-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	most of the boards I saw had intel x58 stickers and seems up to date
2011-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	is there anything in particular I should avoid
2011-01-27T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	that doesn't mean much. look at the sound chips and the network chips used etc
2011-01-27T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	I'm very biased in what to avoid
2011-01-27T17:46:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	what is your basis for bias?
2011-01-27T17:46:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	makes or chipsets.. i'd like a pinch of knowledge.. :-)
2011-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	i dislike some companys like ATi which wil start some weird flame/arguments
2011-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	creative are another of my pet peeves
2011-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	i always use nvidia
2011-01-27T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	me too, their linux support is phenominal
2011-01-27T17:54:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	i read that the linux kernal would support the ingrated graphics of the icore processors and that using the nvidia cards would mean using propriatory drivers?
2011-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	yes, iv'e seen some users with integrated intel video but it can be hit and miss. Depends on the system use
2011-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	i thought there would be a beneift the the ubuntu system recognising the motherboard + cpu (with combinted GPU) out of hte box
2011-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	daveb_	ActionParsnip	the arguement was that the kernal would have direct access to the graphics rather than going through the black-box nvidia drivers?
2011-01-27T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daveb_	never had an issue myself, but you'll hear a billion different stories if you ask a billion people
