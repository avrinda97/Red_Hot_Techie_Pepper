2010-04-14T01:44:00.000Z	histo		 Okay whats the magic shortuct that I bumped that disabled my touchpad?
2010-04-14T01:45:00.000Z	histo		It works fine at the GDM screen but soon as a login mouse is disabled.
2010-04-14T01:45:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	It is probably an FN key plus a F<number here> key
2010-04-14T01:55:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	It was prolly disabled by a hotkey
2010-04-14T01:56:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	I have a button that can disable right above the touchpad its not disabled because the light isn't lit. The pad works fine on GDM just right after I login it stops working.
2010-04-14T01:57:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	Hmm. That is odd. What kind of touchpad is it?
2010-04-14T01:57:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	I was working in a gnome-terminal ssh'd in to another box earlier and it just went crayz.
2010-04-14T01:57:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	by crazy I mean scrreen flickerd and mouse pointer stoped responding. But keyboard was fine.
2010-04-14T01:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	Hmm. That is odd. What kind of touchpad is it?
2010-04-14T01:59:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	let me check i'm not sure who makes it its on an hp laptop
2010-04-14T01:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	It is probably synaptics then.
2010-04-14T02:01:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	yeah its using synaptics and there is some macintosh button emulation on. Which i think might be the culprit. although I have no idea how I could have turne dit on with keypresses.
2010-04-14T02:02:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	type `gconf-editor` in a terminal
2010-04-14T02:02:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	yeah any idea what key i'm looking for in there?
2010-04-14T02:03:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	desktop > gnome > peripherals > touchpad
2010-04-14T02:03:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	it was disabled
2010-04-14T02:04:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	how could I have done that with keyboard
2010-04-14T02:04:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	I have no idea lol that is random. usually if there is not an fn key it is the button above it, which you stated was on. I have no idea.
2010-04-14T02:06:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	Is it re-enabled?
2010-04-14T02:21:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	yeah its a bug from resuming after bumping the button. I can recreate it.
2010-04-14T02:21:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	I'll look at filing it later
2010-04-14T02:21:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	As long as it works now lol
2010-04-14T02:24:00.000Z	histo	crucialhoax	yeah but definately a bug.
2010-04-15T09:53:00.000Z	crucialhoax	histo	xangua has no issues lol
