2007-09-21T06:53:00.000Z	Vadi		My friend wants to dualboot with Ubuntu, but we've ran into a problem during the installation. can someone please help diagnose this?
2007-09-21T06:53:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	the problem is?
2007-09-21T06:54:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	The guide says that ubuntu should detect the vista patrition
2007-09-21T06:54:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	but it's failing to do so.
2007-09-21T06:55:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	I can link you his screenshots in a moment
2007-09-21T06:57:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	okay, the guide says the screenshot should be like this, with the migration assistant saying that there's a vista patrition
2007-09-21T06:57:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	http://snipurl.com/1qzma
2007-09-21T06:58:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	but his is actually like this: http://snipurl.com/1qzmj.
2007-09-21T07:00:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	so what's the issue? i dont believe it's gonna wipe the entire drive
2007-09-21T07:00:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	and here's what vista's patritoner shows: http://snipurl.com/1qzmo
2007-09-21T07:00:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	yeah but it's not detecting vista! And his patritions look weird
2007-09-21T07:01:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	that final screenshot -does- look in line with his patritons, right?
2007-09-21T07:01:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	yes, its OEM junk
2007-09-21T07:01:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	you know, recovery partitions and all that
2007-09-21T07:02:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	right. But did ubuntu select the right empty patrition? I can't really tell
2007-09-21T07:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	not sure about detection business, dont really have to
2007-09-21T07:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	if you're not sure, you can always do manual
2007-09-21T07:02:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	ehh not an option here
2007-09-21T07:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l then :)
2007-09-21T07:03:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	from the livecd?
2007-09-21T07:03:00.000Z	scguy318	Vadi	yeah
2007-09-21T07:13:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	here's the output of the fdisk (http://pastebin.ca/705337). Is it right?
2007-09-21T07:16:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	here's the output of fdisk (http://pastebin.ca/7053370). Does it look right?
2007-09-21T07:21:00.000Z	Vadi	scguy318	okay, we'll try and go ahead with the install..
