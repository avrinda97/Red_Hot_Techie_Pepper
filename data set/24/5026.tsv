2006-11-10T17:51:00.000Z	gonzoism		i'm having the problem with eth0 and eth1 switching.  the mac addresses on the cards are the same, so i can't use /etc/iftab to fix it.  anyone have a suggestion ?
2006-11-10T17:51:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	The MAC addresses on the cards can't be the same.
2006-11-10T17:54:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	the mac addresses on the cards ARE the same.  i'm sure
2006-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	No two networking cards, no matter what brand or model will ever have the same MAC address.
2006-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	mine do...  would you like to see the output from ifconfig ?
2006-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	yeah, by default.  i set the mac address in them using ifconfig.
2006-11-10T06:03:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	Post your ifconfig files on pastebin
2006-11-10T06:03:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	ifconfig eth0 hw ether 34:52:8C:F3:D0:B8
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	 that does it.  any address would work as long as its valid
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	Pastebin the output
2006-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	why do you want the output ?  i guess i will..  what is pastebin url ?
2006-11-10T06:08:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	done.  under name duplicate_mac_address
2006-11-10T06:08:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	What's the URL
2006-11-10T06:09:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30833/
2006-11-10T06:10:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	i pasted the command to do it above.  the command i use
2006-11-10T06:10:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	How many network cards you have in your system?
2006-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	Any onboard?
2006-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	 yeah
2006-11-10T06:26:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	Check out the man page for iftab...look for the "arp" selector...could that be of any help?
2006-11-10T06:27:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	 yeah, i saw in the man page i can identify them by driver.  i'm gonna do that.  also you can id them by other stuff
2006-11-10T06:28:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	good luck :)
2006-11-10T06:35:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	When I first started Ubuntu I was discouraged from using Automatix by the channel.
2006-11-10T06:35:00.000Z	gonzoism	ajax4	  how come ?
2006-11-10T06:36:00.000Z	ajax4	gonzoism	Probably something to do with what fishsticks said.
