2007-07-19T13:13:00.000Z	tamale		Hi everyone, X fails to start from the feisty installer disc (even in safe graphics mode) on my rather new HP core 2 duo laptop
2007-07-19T13:14:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	pretty common. use alternate install cd
2007-07-19T13:15:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	or of course alt-ctrl-f2 login then type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and choose vesa as your driver
2007-07-19T13:15:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	Darn.  (I would use a much stronger word).  I don't have any spare CDRs with me.. why wouldn't the most widely used disc work? :[
2007-07-19T13:15:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-07-19T13:15:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	should be workable in livecd. i dont have much exp with it though
2007-07-19T13:15:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	thanks, i'll try that
2007-07-19T13:20:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	even vesa didn't work
2007-07-19T13:20:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	what the heck
2007-07-19T13:21:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	does x crash or just a black screen?
2007-07-19T13:21:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	x crashes
2007-07-19T13:21:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	i'm tryin to read the crash report to see if there is anything useful in here
2007-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	this an intel or ati or nvidia or what?
2007-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	ati x1600 pro
2007-07-19T13:22:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	im sorry i have little exp with ati. either the open drivers or closed
2007-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	they are as a rule problematic. nvidia is as a rule flawless for regular use
2007-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	are any drivers loaded for the live cd start??
2007-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	dyrne		!ati | tamale
2007-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	that might help. you can sudo apt-get install whatever package you need in livecd. sorry not more help
2007-07-19T13:24:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	I'm nowhere near having networking or anything like that.. i'm just booting the install disc.. heh
2007-07-19T13:25:00.000Z	dyrne	tamale	hardline or wireless network
2007-07-19T13:25:00.000Z	dyrne		?
2007-07-19T13:27:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	i'm on a hard line
2007-07-19T13:27:00.000Z	tamale	dyrne	you mean to tell me i can install ATI drivers before ever even booting?
