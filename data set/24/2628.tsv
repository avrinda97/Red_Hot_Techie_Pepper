2008-11-01T20:44:00.000Z	lianimator		is it possible to upgrade skipping a version?
2008-11-01T20:45:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	only from LTS to LTS
2008-11-01T20:45:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	you have to go to hardy first then
2008-11-12T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	you want to remove ubuntu?
2008-11-12T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	jobe: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X may be helpful.  Also, you should be able to pass the appropriate ServerFlag in xorg.conf (search for "hal" in 'man xorg.conf') and just use your old xorg.conf with that addition.  I don't have a tablet though
2008-11-12T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	don't know, check x.org I guess
2008-11-12T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	progress!  Nah, the goal is that eventually, you can just plugin your tablet at any time and it will just work.  That's one of the things hal, udev, and hotplug are going to let you do
2008-11-12T18:35:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	but for now, things will be more complicated.. I wonder how many more version til everything "just works"
2008-11-12T18:35:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	I'd really want that day to com ASAP
2008-11-12T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	nothing wrong with using hardy or a more conservative distribution if that's what you need
2008-11-12T18:36:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	hardy doesn't work with my wifi... only hardy!
2008-11-12T18:36:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	then you must choose: internet or tablet?  I think internet wins :)  You can probably sort out the tablet thing eventually
2008-11-12T18:38:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	jobe: I don't have a tablet yet.. I plan to get one with my scholarship money..
2008-12-02T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	probably because it expects a binary, not shell code
2008-12-02T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	or at least some_program, not shell code
2008-12-02T17:33:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	I would have to write a script?
2008-12-05T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	just right click on the ubuntu icon -> edit menu
2008-12-05T17:11:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	oh, I can actually delete it also
2008-12-15T00:07:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	that doesn't really make much sense to me
2008-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	well if the algorithm isn't programmed to run in parallel you'll have a tough time doing that
2008-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	oh okay, thanks
2008-12-15T00:10:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	you might check with #gimp to see if it's possible or not
2009-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	lianimator	read /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/README.Debian
2009-02-04T06:44:00.000Z	lianimator	jrib	thanks. I'll try this first.
