2005-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	cmug		Any1 wanna help me setup WPA wireless on ubuntu 5.04 livecd?
2005-04-22T06:36:00.000Z	cmug		I am trying to enable my wireless pcmcia card to use WPA-PSK. I manage to get WEP working. Where do I input WPA-PSK encryption key?
2005-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	cmug		the AP is rejecting me
2005-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	aiui you need to use wpa-supplicant manually
2005-04-22T06:37:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	aha, what does that mean then
2005-04-22T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	that you need to install the wpa-supplicant package and read the manpage, I guess
2005-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	lol what is the wpa-supplicant? where do I get it?
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	as I said, it's a package in ubuntu
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	ok thanks
2005-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	install it as you install any other package. (wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto)
2005-04-22T06:44:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	altho, there is no such package "wpa-supplicant" or wpa or supplicant
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	er, wpasupplicant, oops
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	that package is certainly in hoary
2005-04-22T06:45:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	i run the 5.04 livecd
2005-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	probably universe isn't enabled on the livecd
2005-04-22T06:46:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	how do I enable that
2005-04-22T06:47:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	yeah but I just want to see it works ;)
2005-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	enabling universal? is this something related to Synaptic?
2005-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
2005-04-22T06:54:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	universe
2005-04-22T06:55:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	ooh my bad. is that a repository?
2005-11-03T15:19:00.000Z	bob2	cmug	gnome is supposed to start it
2005-11-03T15:20:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	it dies when I exit enemy territory
2005-11-03T15:20:00.000Z	cmug	bob2	how do I restart it
