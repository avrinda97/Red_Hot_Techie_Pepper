2008-08-09T12:37:00.000Z	eitreach		How do I make Pessulus require root?
2008-08-09T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	Why do you want to do that?
2008-08-09T12:38:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	it's a kiosk-tool. If anyone can access it, it sort of ruins the entire thing.
2008-08-09T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	You probably don't want it runnin as root, but you can set up "regular" permission things (making it so it can only be run by a certain group of users, for instance)
2008-08-09T12:39:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	right.. how do I do that?
2008-08-09T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	Hmmm, actually, the group is already made.  change its group to 'admin'  and then remove execute rights from "anyone" (so only owner and group are +x)
2008-08-09T12:40:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	Thanks. I'll try that out.
2008-08-09T12:50:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	I tried editing the permissions via nautilus, but instead of being prompted for a password, it's simply not starting now. It's sort-of-progress, but.. yeah.
2008-08-09T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	What are the permsissions on the program? (ls -l /path/to/bin)
2008-08-09T12:53:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	-rwxr-x--x 1 root root 2620 2008-03-10 23:32
2008-08-09T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	Alright, its not owned by admin, and you need to remove the -x from "anyone"
2008-08-09T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	sudo chmod 750 /whatever/ && sudo chown root:admin /path/to/whatever
2008-08-09T12:55:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	thanks!
2008-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	hmm.. I'm told that the path is not a directory.
2008-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	sorry, no trailing slash
2008-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	/path/to/whatever for both
2008-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	hm. still doesn't require a password. -rwxr-x--- 1 root admin 2620 2008-03-10 23:32
2008-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	It won't require a password, it just requires you to be in the admin group.
2008-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	Presumably your other users wouldn't be in the admin group? (if they were, they'd be able to sudo anyway)
2008-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	eitreach	Flannel	ah.. right. So i I create an unprivileged user, it wouldn't be able to access it?
2008-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	Correct
2008-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	because ony root, or users in the admin group, are able to execute that file
2008-08-22T23:22:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	You should ask in #kubuntu-kde4
2008-10-14T00:28:00.000Z	Flannel	eitreach	You might try asking in #winehq, there may be some extra steps you have to take to tell wine about it
