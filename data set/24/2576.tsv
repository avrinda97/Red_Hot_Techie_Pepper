2008-11-03T14:43:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		how do i install ubuntu within another distro
2008-11-03T14:44:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		no i want to install it for real
2008-11-03T14:45:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		it should be possible though, all it has to do is copy some files
2008-11-03T14:46:00.000Z	BiosElement	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	No it shouldn't be possible. an Operating System isn't the same as any other program.
2008-11-03T14:47:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		in this case it is since i won't be needing grub on the mbr since it's already there
2008-11-03T14:47:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		what if i install it on vmware then copy the files
2008-11-03T14:48:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		"no, you can't do it" isn't really an answer, so my question still stands :)
2008-11-03T14:48:00.000Z	BiosElement	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	Yes it is an answer. It's a No, it cannot be done. So your answer is solved.
2008-11-03T14:48:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		...
2008-11-03T14:49:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		could anyone actually explain why it's not possible
2008-11-03T14:49:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		because so far nobody has
2008-11-03T14:49:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		if its possible to install ubuntu on vmware and copy the files to a real partition on my system
2008-11-03T14:49:00.000Z	BiosElement	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	Because it's an operating system. Not a program. It has to work with devices and it won't work inside another OS. Get over it.
2008-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		...
2008-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		youre not even getting the question bioselement
2008-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		i dont want to BOOT it from within my running distro
2008-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	BiosElement	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	Here's your question you stated a minute ago. "how do i install ubuntu within another distro"
2008-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		same drive, yes, same partition, no
2008-11-03T14:51:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		already have grub installed
2008-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		no
2008-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		just install it
2008-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK		yeah
2008-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	BiosElement	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	Why not just install it direct to the partition? Your question is flawed and you don't need to install it "in another distro". You just install it to the partition and it'll set up grub for you quick and easy.
2008-11-03T14:53:00.000Z	FSCK_FSCK_FSCK	BiosElement	because i don't want my mbr overwritten and I don't want to reboot just yet
