2010-11-22T21:21:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 i have tvtime to read composite input for consoles/dvd players
2010-11-22T21:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	I found this me-tv might try that apt-get install me-tv
2010-11-22T21:31:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 ok ill test that
2012-03-14T22:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	without the computer sending the stream?  skype?
2012-03-14T22:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	you can record it local and receive the sound.wav over internet later if that's what you mean
2012-03-14T22:12:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 no i mean  the computer sending the stream has noone there  but has a mic attached . is it possible to send a command to it so i can listen on that device from anywhere ?
2012-03-14T22:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	I'm lost ,  the computer has a mic and it has internet,  so why wouldn't you be able to record and stream over internet?
2012-03-14T22:15:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 ok its a unmanned station . it has a internet connection , it has a mic attached.    now i want to be able to open up a terminal/program to listen to that mic live  from a different computer
2012-03-14T22:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	to start you would need to have ssh server setup on your remote side to enable control, then maybe something like this http://www.adriancoroian.com/technical-stream-audio-on-the-web-with-pulseaudio-in-ubuntu-10-10/
2012-03-14T22:19:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 yes ssh is active + ok ill check it out thanks
2012-03-14T22:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	you could also bring up vnc on the remote site and bring up skype or equivilant then you could also talk back if your speakers were pluged in
2012-03-14T22:24:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 hmm  i just need 1 way  mic input > me
2012-03-14T22:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	but if your listening don't you also want to watch with you webcam?
2012-03-14T22:28:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 it has no cam . built into laptop :(   im just using it as a sercurity feature as laptop gets passed round . and this seems like best way  so see whos on it with out there acknowledgement
2012-03-14T22:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	dragonkeeper	just listen?  at least with vnc you could also see a miror image of the screen that they see in almost real time.
2012-03-14T22:35:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	sacarlson	 i fault of that . but doesnt that show up on screen that someone is watching ?
