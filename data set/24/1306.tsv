2011-02-02T16:39:00.000Z	Oer		hi, i have an update, wich will not install and just hang there > http://picpaste.com/update-MO1G0K9o.png i tried sudo apt-get install -f but this does not solve anything > http://paste.ubuntu.com/561356/
2011-02-02T16:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	can you do « LC_ALL=C sudo apt-get install -f » so we see the error messages in english ?
2011-02-02T16:42:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	it gives me  '0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.'

2011-02-02T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	ok; i can figure out; the first message is the following pavkage was installed automatically and is no longer needed use « sudo apt-get autoremove » to uninstall it or some such
2011-02-02T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	did you do that?

2011-02-02T16:52:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	just found out there are 2 more in #Ubuntu-nl with the same issue, i do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade now
2011-02-02T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	how lng has been this happening ?
2011-02-02T16:54:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	i noticed it yesterday
2011-02-02T16:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	could be slow mirroring; some needed package is not still mirrored to nl mirrors so the package that depends on it is help back... all that may be needed is to wait a few hours or a day
2011-02-02T16:57:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	oke, i wait for another day to see what is happening, is it a depencie missing ?
2011-02-02T16:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	another option is to change mirrors to see if that is the case ...
2011-02-02T17:03:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	found a bugreport, same issue, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/711601 see #6 libc-bin 2.12.1-0ubuntu10.2 was moved from proposed to updates, It's only a question of time, now, before it hits all the mirrors.  ( so i have a coffee )
2011-02-02T17:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oer	ok
2011-02-02T19:30:00.000Z	Oer	erUSUL	libc6 update arrived, upstart update problem solved :-)
