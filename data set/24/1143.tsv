2010-06-20T07:31:00.000Z	moatbuilders	wireshark	I was joking. You clearly wanted a plugin for some music player and i suggested a pause to play a good game ?
2010-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	wireshark	moatbuilders	 did you understand my problem?
2010-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	moatbuilders	wireshark	"YES" -> wireshark: <wireshark> i don't have the media plugin on chromium...what i have to do to install it?"
2010-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	wireshark		so moatbuilders what i have to do?
2010-06-20T07:34:00.000Z	moatbuilders	wireshark	I have no ideea. Didnt find it to be much of a problem. This is why i suggested a good game of Chromium BSU (Chromium beeing the same name as you thought yould be able to use as the music player plugin or so)
