2007-03-20T14:21:00.000Z	Alonea		my battery symbol is gone from my taskbar, how do I get it back?
2007-03-20T14:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	right click on the panel, select add to panel and find the right applet
2007-03-20T14:21:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	it wasn't listed
2007-03-20T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	it is there, it might be called power management or something
2007-03-20T14:22:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	there isn't power anything on the list
2007-03-20T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	if it was on your panel, it is in there
2007-03-20T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	unless you uninstalled it or something
2007-03-20T14:23:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	not that I know of. I just installed this system a couple days ago.
2007-03-20T15:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	I believe you can edit the path in /etc/environment
2007-03-20T15:24:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"  ????
2007-03-20T15:25:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	right, tack it on
2007-03-20T15:26:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	make it PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games:/usr/local/arm-elf/bin"
2007-03-20T15:26:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	thanks
2007-03-20T15:27:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	:( thing still says its not in path...
2007-03-20T15:28:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	close and open the terminal
2007-03-20T15:31:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	nope. still says its not found, not in path

2007-03-20T15:35:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	its the one that the program told me to use...@@
2007-03-20T15:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Alonea	you have it in there twice by the way, don't know if that does anything, just saying
2007-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	Alonea	bruenig	dunno, thats when I did the export path thing the first time around and that didn't work.
