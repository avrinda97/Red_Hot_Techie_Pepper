2006-11-01T17:52:00.000Z	kevb		Can anyone guide me through installing vino from edgy-proposed?
2006-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	if you have the .deb, sudo dpkg -i vino*.deb
2006-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	I don't have the .deb, i don't know how to get it : )
2006-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	is -proposed in sources.list?
2006-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	I added proposed to the end of "... edgy main restricted..."
2006-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	i have not used -proposed myself, but if so, i would imagine you would just sudo apt-get install vino
2006-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	in sources.list
2006-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	wait, i think you have an error in syntax there, let me clarify
2006-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	when i did apt-get update it failed on proposed, i'm not sure it exists
2006-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	okay, cool, error confirmed :)
2006-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	"deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu edgy main restricted universe multiverse proposed"
2006-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	revert to your former sources.list, you had an "edgy main..." line, right?
2006-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	yeah
2006-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	take off proposed, then sudo apt-get update, to confirm the file is good at that point
2006-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	it is, it actually failed on proposed
2006-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	Unable to find expected entry  proposed/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file
2006-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	then *duplicate* that entire line, and turn "edgy" into "edgy-proposed"
2006-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	ahhhhh : )
2006-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	the original line should *not* have proposed at the end, just so i'm clear about that
2006-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	yup, kk, testing
2006-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	kevb	sudo apt-get update, to confirm the file is good at that point
2006-11-01T17:58:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	It's good and your a hero : ) Let me see if I can install vino now
2006-11-01T06:00:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	oh no, it says vino is at newest version
2006-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	kevb	eyequeue	This bug (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/65795) seems to say it is updated (fixed) in proposed.
