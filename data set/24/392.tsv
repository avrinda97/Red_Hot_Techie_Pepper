2012-04-01T15:03:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	it might be you are not using the right driver
2012-04-01T15:03:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	because non-optimized drivers might have the limit because of performance.
2012-04-01T15:04:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	are you sure you are *using* the driver?
2012-04-01T15:05:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	the first and easiest test is to run glxgears and see the framerates
2012-04-01T15:05:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	but it's probably best to check with glxinfo
2012-04-01T15:05:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	yeah, both.
2012-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	ok, so glx works, try glxinfo and see the first few lines
2012-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	on the first few lines there should be a driver ide
2012-04-01T15:09:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	ok, so you are using the right driver :)
2012-04-01T15:10:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	but next time, post into something like pastebin.com
2012-04-01T15:11:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	do you know where the limit is set as I know the hardware and the drivers work before, so if I can just get around this limit
2012-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	I thought it was xorg.conf but that doesnt seem to be doing anything
2012-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	does ati have a control panel?
2012-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	because all of this should be settable without restarting X
2012-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	try with xrandr
2012-04-01T15:14:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	ati has a ui interface I've tried changing settings and doesnt work.  xrandr whats that? without restarting x, you mean get rid of xorg.conf maybe?
2012-04-01T15:14:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	shouldnt xorg.conf my virtual settings override this and fix the problem?
2012-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	no, xorg.conf just sets the defaults.
2012-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	I've heard I should get rid of xorg.conf and reboot but just not confident about that
2012-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	oh okay, so there is no way to change this limit?
2012-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	well... maybe you should just move it.
2012-04-01T15:15:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	I have no idea, I've been on nvidia all my life
2012-04-01T15:18:00.000Z	zarex	atomicity	not really sure what to do, a recent ATI graphics card, a decent machine, I do one simple update and lose all my monitors, not a great experience.
2012-04-01T15:29:00.000Z	atomicity	zarex	try in #xorg
