2011-02-12T22:11:00.000Z	newbish_kid1		I tried gnome-shell.....did not like it.....went back to metacity....but now I cannot see desktop icons or right click on desktop.  Have googled but solutions offered do not work.  This on Ubuntu 10.04
2011-02-12T22:13:00.000Z	newbish_kid1		tried rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity  but still......no desktop icons or ability to right click make new folder etc.
2011-02-12T22:13:00.000Z	newbish_kid1		I cannot drag and drop anything to the desktops.  Are there nautilus settings I need to restore/reset??
2011-02-12T22:15:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	did you install via a ppa?
2011-02-12T22:22:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	have you removed gnome-shell?
2011-02-12T22:24:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	yes I removed it....but will try again....is the command sudo apt-get remove gnome-shell
2011-02-12T22:24:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	apt-cache policy nautilus
2011-02-12T22:24:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	and pastebinit
2011-02-12T22:24:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	paste the result I mean.:)
2011-02-12T22:28:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	ok there isnt a different version from a ppa o whatever..  was gnome-shell from a ppa?
2011-02-12T22:28:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	let me find the link i clicked on to install gnome-shell
2011-02-12T22:35:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	I used this guid....check out the eye candy section...that is how I installed gnome-shell
2011-02-12T22:36:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	what guide
2011-02-12T22:38:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	I clicked on a link in this guide http://blog.thesilentnumber.me/2010/04/ubuntu-1004-post-install-guide-what-to.html#eye%20candy that ran apt:gnome-shell
2011-02-12T22:38:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	ok, so it wa from standard repository....  thats all I wanted to know.  rm .nautilus -rf and rm .gconf/apps/nautilus -rf and sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus and logout/login
2011-02-12T22:40:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	do I use alt f2 to exit to terminal then run those commands and do they need sudo in front of them??
2011-02-12T22:40:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	only the apt-get needs sudo
2011-02-12T22:41:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	thats not a terminal
2011-02-12T22:41:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	just ctrl-alt-T and type those commands
2011-02-12T22:42:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	yes
2011-02-12T22:42:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	rm .nautilus .gconf/apps/nautilus -rf ; sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus    (bit tidier)
2011-02-12T22:45:00.000Z	newbish_kid1	mongy	no good....still cannot right click on desktop, drag or drop anything onto it, and cd drive does not show up
2011-02-12T22:47:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	might just be gconf settings then, disabled by gnome-shell.... not sure the exact place to look but have a look in gconf-editor
2011-02-12T22:48:00.000Z	mongy	newbish_kid1	you can at least enable/disable desktop icons in there, so might be something for whatever else.  Someone else might have more info if they wanna chime in :)
