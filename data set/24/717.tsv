2011-03-01T23:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	have you got a problem?
2011-03-02T00:00:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 yes whenever i boot into win 7, and then retart my boot menu is not there, and there is an error message, no operating system found
2011-03-02T00:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	but you are able to boot into windows?
2011-03-02T00:02:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 only one time, then I have to reinstall Ubuntu , i have done this 5 times
2011-03-02T00:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	if you installed windows after linux, then windows overwrites the grub bootloader
2011-03-02T00:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510		!grub2 | Gibss37
2011-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	Gibss37		the methd mentioned there say each time boot with live cd and make fresh mbr or grub.config
2011-03-02T00:04:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 the methd mentioned there say each time boot with live cd and make fresh mbr or grub.config
2011-03-02T00:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	have you tried that?
2011-03-02T00:05:00.000Z	Gibss37		no not yet, I'm afraid
2011-03-02T00:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	give it a go and see if it works
2011-03-02T00:06:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 I have also got to know you can use grub for both win7 and linux, then you face no probs
2011-03-02T00:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	yes, you can boot windows (and many other os's) from grub2
2011-03-02T00:07:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 how
2011-03-02T00:07:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	the link i showed you tells you how to set it up, follow those steps
2011-03-02T00:08:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	is it possible if i copy grub.cfg and replace it after each time i use windows using live cd
2011-03-02T00:10:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	the whole point of grub is to give you a list of systems to boot into, you should only need to install it once and at every boot you can choose windows or ubuntu (or any others)
2011-03-02T00:11:00.000Z	Gibss37	ThinkT510	 so okay i try to do it
2011-03-02T00:12:00.000Z	Gibss37		!grub
2011-03-02T00:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Gibss37	current ubuntu uses grub2
