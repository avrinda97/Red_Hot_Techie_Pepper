2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	zewb		well at least without sudo they need 2 passwords
2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	zewb		one to ssh in, because i dont permit root login from remote
2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	zewb		and then another to get root priviledges
2011-02-09T15:29:00.000Z	zewb		that seems kind of silly though
2011-02-09T15:29:00.000Z	zewb		have there been any security exploits in sudo?
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	zewb		im finding a lot of vulnerabilites for sudo on seclists
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	zewb		i think i would like to disable it
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	zewb		and just stick with the traditional unix way
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	zewb		can someone tell me how to set a root password
2011-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	zewb		and remove sudo
2011-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	why do you want to remove sudo?
2011-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	such as?
2011-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	zewb	tsimpson	sudo vulnerability
2011-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	zewb	tsimpson	google that
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	have you checked if any of the vulnerabilities you see actually exist?
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	zewb	tsimpson	http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=sudo+exploits#hl=en&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=sudo+vulnerability&cp=7&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=0&aqi=&aql=&oq=sudo+vu&pbx=1&bav=on.1,or.&fp=8dfe5727866dfbaf
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	that's not an answer to my question
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	do they _still_ exist
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	zewb	tsimpson	no but they could in a future update
2011-02-09T15:34:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	and how many people have access to your system?
2011-02-09T15:34:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	and do you have ssh/telnet servers installed?
2011-02-09T15:35:00.000Z	zewb	tsimpson	yeah
2011-02-09T15:35:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	if you have ssh or any remote login means, sudo is protection because people can not brute-force the root password
2011-02-09T15:40:00.000Z	tsimpson	zewb	sudo is protection for your system, just because there have been vulnerabilities discovered in the past does not mean it is not secure. many vulnerabilities have been discovered in PAM in the past, are you going to remove that too? what about the vulnerabilities in the kernel? does that mean that you should remove that?
