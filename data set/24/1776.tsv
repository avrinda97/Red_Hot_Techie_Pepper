2009-08-29T10:06:00.000Z	Dan48p		hello?
2009-08-29T10:06:00.000Z	Dan48p		hi, what is this thing that i happened upon?
2009-08-29T10:07:00.000Z	Dan48p		well, i'm kind of trying to figure out which version to use ubuntu or kubuntu
2009-08-29T10:07:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	you can use both on the same machine.. load ubuntu then there's a way to load kubuntu and switch between them on the login screen
2009-08-29T10:09:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	then sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and use sessions on the login screen to switch
2009-08-29T10:16:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	at least this one is.. there are others too.. as well as the one's that are populated by "other" ventures.
2010-10-30T08:59:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	is there a way to get a more current video driver than the one that shows up in the standard search?
2010-10-30T09:00:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	maybe.. depends.. what kind of card do you have?
2010-10-30T09:01:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	mine is a gtx260
2010-10-30T09:02:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	there's a PPA on launchpad that hosts a .deb install for the latest nvidia binary.. doing it manually is much more difficult than it use to be several releases ago.  use the PPA to do the upgrade/install.
2010-10-30T09:03:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	i'm sorry, what is a PPA?
2010-10-30T09:05:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	ok.  do you think that would be worth a shot to get my rid of vertical tearing, or is there something else that might be amiss with my setup?
2010-10-30T09:06:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	most likely it's just the driver.. I use it on my 8200 card on my desktop with no issues really.. you can always uninstall it and go back to the previous one.. a ppa will allow you to list it as a repository.. so typically it's a simple update
2010-10-30T09:08:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	is the "Ubuntu-X" the one i'm looking for?
2010-10-30T09:09:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	not sure.. hang on.
2010-10-30T09:10:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	give me the link
2010-10-30T09:11:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates
2010-10-30T09:11:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	and then theres this one too: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2010-10-30T09:14:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	this one https://launchpad.net/~nvidia-vdpau
2010-10-30T09:16:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	thanks for the help... we'll see how this goes
2010-10-30T09:17:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	after adding the ppa repository then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.. with the new driver installed you may have to restart x with sudo service gdm restart
2010-10-30T09:18:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	do i need to remove the drivers that i currently have installed?
2010-10-30T09:18:00.000Z	izinucs	Dan48p	no..
2010-10-30T09:18:00.000Z	Dan48p	izinucs	ok
