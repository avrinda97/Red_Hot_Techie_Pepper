2008-09-19T23:19:00.000Z	Sake		I was having problems running thunderbird. It seems to run normally without error (even from the command line), but when I start it up, I get the popup for my new messages, but the app never appears in the command line or on my screen. Could it be dumping errors to a log file somewhere? How do I debug this?
2008-09-19T23:20:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	try starting thunderbird from the terminal, with : thunderbird &
2008-09-19T23:21:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	You will get any error messages or warnings straight to your terminal that way.
2008-09-19T23:22:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	if you would like to browse them afterwards, just type: thunderbird 2>thunderbird.error &
2008-09-19T23:22:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	that will give you all the errors and warnings in that file.
2008-09-19T23:23:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	I do that and still get no errors though
2008-09-19T23:23:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	It just seems to vanish
2008-09-19T23:23:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	 and ps -e returns two processes: thunderbird and thunderbird-bin
2008-09-19T23:24:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	maybe there is a cmd-line parameter that shows more warnings than normal. There is bound to be a thunderbird channel right here on Freenode that might give you more specific info
2008-09-19T23:24:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	yea, I was just wondering if there was some general system log that it might be dumping errors to
2008-09-19T23:25:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	normally it should dump any errors to standard_error that gets redirected to the file with 2>thunderbird.error
2008-09-19T23:26:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	yea, I know that much. I just had read something about a System Message log a while back. Wondering if maybe that might help
2008-09-19T23:27:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	there is no official thunderbird channel on Freenode. There is a mozilla channel, though.
2008-09-19T23:28:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	strike that, mozilla seems to be an alias for firefox# (...Sigh...)
2008-09-19T23:29:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	try running thunderbird in safe-mode, like so: thunderbird -safe-mode &
2008-09-19T23:30:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	Hrmm, maybe it's displaying to the wrong X Session? How do I get the label for my current session?
2008-09-19T23:30:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	 cause even in safe mode, it launches, process is listed, but it's not displayed anywhere
2008-09-19T23:31:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	try removing thunderbird and reinstalling through the package manager, like sudo apt-get remove thunderbird && sudo ap-get install thunderbird
2008-09-19T23:32:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	this won't effect your e-mail, it will just reinstall your thunderbird
2008-09-19T23:38:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	thanks, trying it out
2008-09-19T23:39:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	most of the times, reinstalling is much faster than tinkering with all kinds of settings ;-)
2008-09-19T23:40:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	I ended up just erasing my .mozilla-thunderbird folder and it seems to have done the trick (didn't have much set up except my gmail imap)
2008-09-19T23:40:00.000Z	Sake	jorrit	Maybe I'll uninstall and re-install too.
2008-09-19T23:42:00.000Z	jorrit	Sake	In that case some of your settings of your previous install went haywire. Glad to hear that everything is running properly again :-D
