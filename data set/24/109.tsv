2012-07-04T12:45:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	for some people, sudo is 10 seconds of extra time
2012-07-04T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	that's what "sudo -i" is for
2012-07-04T12:46:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	still requires a password.
2012-07-04T12:47:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	so does sudo su, that also gives you root@localhost, but some people don't like entering passwords, I for one use a biometric reader and send it to PAM
2012-07-04T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	no, that's is a terrible idea
2012-07-04T12:47:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	what is?
2012-07-04T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	sudo su
2012-07-04T12:47:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	does the same thing as sudo -i
2012-07-04T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	it doesn't
2012-07-04T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	there are slight differences
2012-07-04T12:48:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	both return root@localhost. The path may be different, but the result is the same.
2012-07-04T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	no, root@localhost is not a way to judge if they do the same thing
2012-07-04T12:49:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	I don't follow you.
2012-07-04T12:51:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	linux is about freedom, there is no "unsupported state"
2012-07-04T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	sure it is,
2012-07-04T12:52:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	If you don't think so, why do you bother using linux in the first place?
2012-07-04T12:52:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	I just agreed with you
2012-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	lets get some coffee, my treat. lol
2012-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	what ?
2012-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	 wanna go out for coffee? :P
2012-07-04T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	what are you talking about, this is an irc channel, please try to keep to realistic conversation, on the ubuntu support topic
2012-07-04T12:59:00.000Z	massdivide	ikonia	bah. No sense of humor. Your like a robot. You need to get out of this text enviroment. 5 cups of ubuntu. Sound fimilar?
2012-07-04T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	massdivide	please stop with this pointless converation.
