2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	Bupsss		guys, i have a big big problem
2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	:)
2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	Bupsss		the file system of my home partition, went off
2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	Bupsss		everything disappeared and it created a new home folder
2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	Bupsss		with a fschk i managed to get back the files in the lost and found folder
2008-12-07T18:49:00.000Z	Bupsss		but now, i'm scared that it could happen again
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	what happened
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	Bupsss		what do you recommend?
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	Bupsss	marcelkoopman	dont really know
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	Bupsss		i rebooted, and everything disappeared
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	its always safer to keep documents on removable drives
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	Bupsss		it did a unclean shutdown check
2008-12-07T18:50:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	i have important things on a usb drive
2008-12-07T18:51:00.000Z	Bupsss	marcelkoopman	me too, but usb drives, are normally less safe than hd
2008-12-07T18:51:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	why?
2008-12-07T18:51:00.000Z	Bupsss		but apart from that.... is that normal that it resets the home folder?
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	if the partition where you mounted /home/user has problems, yes
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	Bupsss	marcelkoopman	but it never happened before
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	what version of ubuntu are you using
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	Bupsss		8.10
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	you use ext3?
2008-12-07T18:52:00.000Z	Bupsss	marcelkoopman	yes
2008-12-07T18:53:00.000Z	Bupsss		should i reinstall the system, or keep the new home?
2008-12-07T18:53:00.000Z	marcelkoopman	Bupsss	i dont think it will happen often, it could but just copy your stuff to usb, thats safer
