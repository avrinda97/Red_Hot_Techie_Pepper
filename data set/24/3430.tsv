2008-01-23T04:08:00.000Z	Some_Person		Why can't you change screensaver settings in ubuntu?
2008-01-23T04:09:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	You should be able to - System -> Preferences -> Screen Saver
2008-01-23T04:09:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	for example, how do i change the text for the text screensaver?
2008-01-23T04:12:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	?? Don't know - you used to be able to!! - Think that was by using the xscreensaver-demo program - but that doesn't appear to be installed in Ubuntu!
2008-01-23T04:13:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	hasn't been since breezy
2008-01-23T04:14:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	Just started with Ubuntu - previously (and still :)) Debian
2008-01-23T04:15:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	its GNOME's fault, their screensaver program, gnome-screensaver, doesn't allow config. someone named xFX created a clone of it that does allow settings, but i find it buggy
2008-01-23T04:16:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	Is there no .xscreensaver config file anymore??
2008-01-23T04:16:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	xscreensaver is phased out
2008-01-23T04:17:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	totally unused
2008-01-23T04:17:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	however, there is a forum post that tells how to replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver
2008-01-23T04:20:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	and i just did that
2008-01-23T04:21:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	I need to catch up with this new fangled Ubuntu thing - Still in Debian mode. Does seem weird that the "new & improved" screensaver program should offer less functionality!
2008-01-23T04:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	yes
2008-01-23T04:22:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	How is xscreensaver :)

2008-01-23T04:22:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	xscreensaver is good, i used it back in breezy
2008-01-23T04:24:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	except one problem with xscreensaver, 2 of my favorite screensavers aren't in the list
2008-01-23T04:28:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	:-(
2008-01-23T04:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	i dont get it, but Hufo's Tunnel and Colorfire, my 2 favorites, aren't there
2008-01-23T04:29:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	Pici beat me to it!!
2008-03-02T01:13:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	his entire windows (including any restore stuff) is gone
2008-03-02T01:14:00.000Z	danand	Some_Person	- yeah. That is why i _really_ don't like restore utilities being on the hard disk
2008-03-02T01:15:00.000Z	Some_Person	danand	yeah, i had that problem. i convinced emachines to send me one though
