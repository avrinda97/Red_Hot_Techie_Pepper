2007-04-12T07:44:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		hi guys I'm a freaking and annoying noob so please forgive me If i sound stupid but I have a few questions. if anyone's interested, please share your knowledge on the topic in question with me. 1) what/who is a 'local attacker' ? 2) does a 'local attacker' need to have physical access to my system to execute an attack? 3) I just went to Ubuntu Official forums and in the 'Ubuntu news and announcements' section discovered that
2007-04-12T07:44:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		developers are urging 6.10 edgy eft users to upgrade their kernel from 'whatever they have' to 2.6.17.1-11.37 to prevent 'local attackers' from running arbatrirary codes or doing anything malicious to the system. does the local attacker need to have physical access to my system if i don't choose to update the kernel? Thanks in advance
2007-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	dj-fu	Hasrat_USA	local attacker implies shell access
2007-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		shell access
2007-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA	dj-fu	can you show an example?
2007-04-12T07:46:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		floppy drive in 2007? oh god!
2007-04-12T07:47:00.000Z	dj-fu	Hasrat_USA	what do you mean an example? a LOCAL user
2007-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		dj-fo no. i want to know what you wanted to imply by saying 'shell access'
2007-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		dj-fo i have access to my own shell, which is called 'konsole'
2007-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	dj-fu	Hasrat_USA	you're a retard, go and die
2007-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	dj-fu		that's a terminal emulator, not a shell.
2007-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA	dj-fu	then what's a shell?
2007-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	dj-fu	Hasrat_USA	/bin/bash? /bin/sh? /bin/zsh? /bin/csh?
2007-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	dj-fu		and a plethora of others?
2007-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	dj-fu		seriously, learn2google
2007-04-12T07:50:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		oh mine is /bin/bash
2007-04-12T07:50:00.000Z	dj-fu		heh, rather.

2007-04-12T07:50:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		damn i'm such a noob
2007-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		lol
2007-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	dj-fu		offsite backups every 2 hours?
2007-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	dj-fu		I'm at a datacentre and we don't even backup that much.
2007-04-12T07:53:00.000Z	Hasrat_USA		ok dj-fu, so, a local attacker is someone who/whoever can illegally gain access to the shell, right? and even if the attacker gains access to the shell from the internet but doesn't have physical access to my system, he still would be called 'local attacker, right?
2007-04-12T07:54:00.000Z	dj-fu	Hasrat_USA	a local user is a user who already has access to your system, through normal means (/etc/passwd, etc). be it an ftp account, shell account or whatever.
