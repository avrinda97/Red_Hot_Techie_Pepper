2008-07-13T03:09:00.000Z	jordo2323		Has anyone had any problems with the Flash 10 update released in the main repositories. It seems to be making flash content slow on my system, or otherwise non-responsive....
2008-07-13T03:11:00.000Z	jordo2323		Checking Adobe's web site, it doesn't even state that Flash 10 was release for Linux. Only 9
2008-07-13T03:11:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	there's a beta version
2008-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	and that was afaik only released in the backports
2008-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	What's the easiest way to get back to nine? Remove backports and update?
2008-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	remove backports, remove flash, install flash
2008-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	will try now....thanks
2008-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	Did you install 10 from backports?
2008-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	I don't use crack :)
2008-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	LOL!
2008-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	I don't think I have backports enabled....I don't know how the updater pulled this down, can I pastebin my sources.list?
2008-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	sure
2008-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	will be a second.....FIREFOX slow...
2008-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	apt-get install konqueror? :)
2008-07-13T03:17:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	I was a KDE freak.....and KONQ is my favorite....but I have feelings using KDE libs on a strict gnome system....

2008-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	lines 57-62
2008-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	also: automatix sucks and died. Don't use it
2008-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	Oh yeah....didn't see that
2008-07-13T03:20:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	Yeah....only tried automatix....didn't really find it that helpful
2008-07-13T03:20:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	 You get into KDE 4 yet?
2008-07-13T03:21:00.000Z	Seveas	jordo2323	me and kde are not best friends, to put it mildly
2008-07-13T03:21:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	I thought so from your Konq remark
2008-07-13T03:21:00.000Z	jordo2323	Seveas	BTW.....that worked, I am back to nine....thanks
