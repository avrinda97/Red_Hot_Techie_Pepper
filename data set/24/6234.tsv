2005-12-08T12:16:00.000Z	glouph		Where  can I report a bug in french ?
2005-12-08T12:18:00.000Z	glouph		Oh wait I thought you said bugbuddy ok i'll try bugzilla
2005-12-08T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	what package is the bug in? (that matters for where you report bugs)
2005-12-08T12:20:00.000Z	glouph		I've no idea nickrud
2005-12-08T12:20:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	then, which application?
2005-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	sometimes it happens when i use firefox, sometimes when i use kpdf or xchat
2005-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	hm, it really helps the dev's if you can try to narrow it down a bit: what kind of bad behavior are you talking about?
2005-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	i'm just working or doing things and suddenly the screen gets green
2005-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	it usually happens when i'm doing lot of things at the same time
2005-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	and this happens in gnome and fluxbox, you said?
2005-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	glouph		yup nickrud
2005-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	heh
2005-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	probably xserver-xorg is the place to file the bug (in bugzilla); be sure to attach your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.
2005-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	glouph		Ok nickrud
2005-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	should i attach a screenshot too ?
2005-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	a before and after maybe
2005-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	glouph		Thank you nickrud
2005-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	attach /var/log/Xorg.0.log as well.
2005-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	glouph		k
2005-12-08T12:27:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	and, finally, describe as clearly and in as much detail as you can, what conditions it happens in.
2005-12-08T12:27:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	all i know is it happens when i overload the desktop
2005-12-08T12:28:00.000Z	glouph	nickrud	should I mention that it does same with the live CD ?
2005-12-08T12:28:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	yes, most certainly.
2005-12-08T12:29:00.000Z	nickrud	glouph	like I said, as much detail as possible :)
