2007-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D		Plz suggest a stable program for me to voice chat with my Yahoo! friends...
2007-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	gaim works for me on yahoo network
2007-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	no, i want to do voice chat! otherwise it works fine
2007-02-24T10:39:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	nm then :)  (though i heard gaim was going to incorporate voice... don't know if thats in cvs or not)
2007-02-24T10:39:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	oh!
2007-02-24T10:39:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	:(
2007-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	only voice chat i've done with windows is via teamspeak...
2007-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	teamspeak... hmmmmm
2007-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	it's a gamer's chat popular with online games.  used to play it with halo.  ts has a linux client, amazingly enough.
2007-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	oh! i googled it already! i think it does not have yahoo voice chat support though! :( and this is bad!
2007-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	does skype work fine with voice on ubuntu?
2007-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	i have not tried it... i was looking at wengophone as a possibility but after we tried vonage at the house (and it sucked badly) i decided not to mess with VoIP for the moment
2007-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	i know there are drivers in ubuntu because i killed them (don't have the hardware, why run the daemons?) but can't speak to usage
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	oh! actually i was going to install ubuntu on someones pc, and he runs xp. he would start using ubuntu, if his voice chat & bluetooth work fine in ubuntu! This was the reason i was asking
2007-02-24T10:53:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	wish i could tell you more but i have never had bluetooth hardware... if i did, i surely would play with it.
2007-02-24T10:54:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	np, thanx mojo
2007-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	i think i should install ubuntu on his pc, and later i can help him out! atleast skype would work.
2007-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	go google up bluetooth ubuntu howto there are several hits to investigate
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	oh! good idea! lol. thanx
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	yeah, look into "obex" utilities too
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	i think i found out how to transfer files to a bluetooth device! its on ubuntuguide.org.
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	mojo	gOLdenHaWK3D	cool beans!  good luck with your userfriend
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	mojo	;) thanx for your help
