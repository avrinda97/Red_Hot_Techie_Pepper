2005-09-21T14:33:00.000Z	er4z0r		could anyone, please, help me with my printer problem: We have a printserver in the net with 2 printers (lp3,lp2) and because we want our windows machines to use them, I shall configure the cups on our samba machine to pass the raw data overto the printserver
2005-09-21T14:33:00.000Z	er4z0r		problem is: I do not find that f'in option. Where can I find official docs for gnome-printer-manager?
2005-09-21T14:34:00.000Z	er4z0r		for passing through "raw" data to the printserver
2005-09-21T14:34:00.000Z	er4z0r		and I can not managa that printer over webinterface as admin-tasks are disabled
2005-09-21T14:36:00.000Z	er4z0r		I select the printer and then I can select drivers (ps, hpjs ...)

2005-09-21T05:19:00.000Z	er4z0r		can you tell me how to configure which user get the mail for root?
2005-09-21T05:19:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	in /etc/aliases you can specify that
2005-09-21T05:19:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	thanks
2005-09-21T05:26:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	do you know how it is possible to forward rootmail to a remote system?
2005-09-21T05:27:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	ok, now that was to obvious ;)
2005-09-24T15:12:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	can you help me?
2005-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	is the repository for freenx reachable again?
2005-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	yes
2005-09-25T16:21:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	do you have any plans to move your repository of freenx to a server with better availability?
2005-09-25T16:22:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	yes
2005-09-25T08:25:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	or simply passwd -l $evilguy
2005-09-27T05:58:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	I think you had a pasting area at your host, right?
2005-09-27T06:06:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	the -d argument needs a parameter...
2005-09-27T06:06:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	hm? Do you know for sure or are you guessing?
2005-09-27T06:07:00.000Z	Seveas	er4z0r	if -d is meant as argument to your program, then you need to prepend it with -- so start-stop-daemon won't interpret it
2005-09-27T06:08:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	aaah, so we're getting closer
2005-09-27T06:10:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	now I get an error from the start stop daemon which tells me that argument --d is not known
2005-09-27T06:11:00.000Z	er4z0r	Seveas	so actually the daemon figured it as an option for itself not for the program that should have been run
