2008-02-07T20:45:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	There was also a nice write up in LJ a few months ago on how to do that
2008-02-07T20:55:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	any luck with the mounting?
2008-02-07T20:56:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	I did not get your answer to usage?  Are you trying to back up to that mount or do you want full access to it always?
2008-02-07T20:56:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	Did you check out that link from LJ?
2008-02-07T20:57:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	the other issue is that the client is behind a NAT with no port forwarding....
2008-02-07T20:57:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	who is the client hosted by ?
2008-02-07T20:58:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	don't understand the question
2008-02-07T20:59:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	is it a home customer (with a basic DSL, wireless, cable modem -- to in home router setup ) or is it a business behind a commercial router pushing the NAT?
2008-02-07T21:00:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	ah, no guarentees on what it is.  This is actually for a major project, there is no guarentee of what connection the machine will have except that it is wireless
2008-02-07T21:00:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	webcam ?
2008-02-07T21:00:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	robot eye webcam
2008-02-07T21:01:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	NICE -- motion detection or constant monitoring ?
2008-02-07T21:01:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	honestly don't know, it's my friends project, I'm just helping with code when I can
2008-02-07T21:02:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	all I know isthat the robot connects to a server which relays to other clients
2008-02-07T21:02:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	My mind is churning with all the possibilities
2008-02-07T21:04:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	it is currently set up with webcam which file dumps to an ftp and then javascript refreshes every second, but that is way to slow
2008-02-07T21:04:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	if there is a better way than remotely mounting /dev/video it'd be great
2008-02-07T21:06:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	I think a temp storage device attached to the 'bot would be slick -- what input ports/jacks does the bot have  -- do you know ?
2008-02-07T21:07:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	basic stripped down IBM thinkpad I believe, so maybe usb.
2008-02-07T21:08:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	the reason we were thinking mounting video0 is because we found a nice java webapplet which would work
2008-02-07T21:10:00.000Z	agoebel	jamesm	sorry, have to run, work time
2008-02-07T21:10:00.000Z	jamesm	agoebel	1GB RAM -- barebones linux-mix built with a cooker to provide cam functionality and temp storage.  Wireless LAN  -- direct feed to server
