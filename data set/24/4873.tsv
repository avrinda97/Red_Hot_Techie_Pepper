2007-03-04T08:36:00.000Z	aesiamun		does anyone know if there are issues with installing wine?  I get the traditional: 'package referred by others but not found' error.
2007-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	aesiamun		apt-get install wine fails
2007-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	try SUDO apt-get install wine
2007-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	did you add thee repositobe?
2007-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	did you add the repository
2007-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	i'm not sure to be truthful.... http://www.winehq.org  click on Download(or get now, something like that). click Ubuntu, it shows you how to add the repo and download wine
2007-03-04T08:40:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	Thanks,  I'm just surprised they don't have their own packages.
2007-03-04T08:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	they do...
2007-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	its in one of the ubuntu repos, i'm just not sure which one to be truthful.
2007-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	there's a gozillion.. :)
2007-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	quite a few.
2007-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	haven't heard of that one.
2007-03-04T08:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	some are official, some are unofficial "backports", etc...
2007-03-04T08:42:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	wow, even Google doesn't know about gozillion
2007-03-04T08:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	gozillion is a really high number....lol
2007-03-04T08:42:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	oooh,...i thought that was the name :)
2007-03-04T08:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	lol.. no.. it was a reference to how many repos are out there for Ubuntu.
2007-03-04T08:43:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	i realize there are a lot of unnoficial ones.  I just would have thought that Ubuntu would have their own wine package in one of the top three.
2007-03-04T08:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	again, i thought it was to be truthful, but who knows.
2007-03-04T08:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	but its real easy to install from the wine repo.
2007-03-04T08:44:00.000Z	aesiamun	IndyGunFreak	yeah i'm looking at it now.
2007-03-04T08:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	ok..
2007-03-04T08:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	sling media?
2007-03-04T08:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	aesiamun	oh ok.
