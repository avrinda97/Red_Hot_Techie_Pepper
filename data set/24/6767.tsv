2005-07-24T05:49:00.000Z	poutine		As I was saying, weirdly, it installed fine before when I used the entire hard drive
2005-07-24T05:50:00.000Z	poutine		Ircing using netcat is unbearable in here, brb
2005-07-24T05:51:00.000Z	poutine		I'm trying to install unbuntu on my other computer, it installed ubuntu fine before, and this cd *just* came out of the slip cover, yet it errors always installing "bsdutils" how can I make it select an external source or fix this?
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	if it's a burnt CD
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	poutine		mo
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	poutine		no
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		hrm
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	poutine		this is a ubuntu cd from ship-it
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	there is a problem with some CD drives and the CD at that exact point
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	poutine		it worked fine before....
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		I encountered the issue myself
2005-07-24T05:52:00.000Z	poutine		well thanks for the free coasters
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	poutine		No, i'll see if I can find the cd I used earlier
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	well, my advice would be to grab the iso off that CD
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	then rsync the image and then burn it
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	poutine		can I somehow keep going with the installation from the point I left off if I have a working CD?
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	yes
2005-07-24T05:53:00.000Z	poutine		how?
2005-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		just stick it in and retry
2005-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	poutine	HrdwrBoB	umm, well no, I'd need to unmount it first
2005-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	heh, point
2005-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	poutine		and it doesn't seem to be reading off the cd drive during that point
2005-07-24T05:54:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	poutine	console is on alt-f2
