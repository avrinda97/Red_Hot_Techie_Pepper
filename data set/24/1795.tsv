2009-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle		Hey, I'm having permission errors when I try to play a DVD in Movieplayer. I do have permissions for the cdrom drive, I've used it to install Doom 3 and UT2004
2009-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle		Sorry forgot to add, when ever I try to play the dvd in Movieplayer, it say's permission denied.
2009-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	try running the following in a terminal and see what error you get, might give a clue "mplayer dvd://1
2009-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	ignore the "
2009-10-08T08:44:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	http://paste.ubuntu.com/288282/
2009-10-08T08:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	did it also start playing?  that looks like a good log.
2009-10-08T08:47:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	Now I can't even open the dvd in Movieplayer. It will start up then suddenly close.
2009-10-08T08:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	did it work with mplayer?
2009-10-08T08:48:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	One sec, I need to restart. The whole system is acting weird
2009-10-08T08:55:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	Okay, the error I get is a box that says "Can not read from Resource."
2009-10-08T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	you never answered - did it work with that mplayer command?
2009-10-08T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	cause the log said it was playing...
2009-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	mplayer never opened
2009-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	what program are you trying to play it in?
2009-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	The stock Movie Player program that comes with 9.04
2009-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	what's it called exactly in the menu?
2009-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	Movie Player
2009-10-08T09:00:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	Applications=> Sound & Video=> Movie Player
2009-10-08T09:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	see I don't have that in my menu (i probably removed it) , i do have an "Mplayer Movie Player" but not just a "Movie Player" (it's probably totem or some such thing which I don't use - and would be no help with at all)
2009-10-08T09:01:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	I think it may be based off of Totem, what would be a decent dvd player to try out?
2009-10-08T09:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	I'm afraid for me it's all mplayer - but i mostly use it from cli or scripts, but I guess I kinda like smplayer for a front end...  but lots of people prefer vlc
2009-10-08T09:04:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	I'm running synaptic and the actual program name is Mplayer Movie Player
2009-10-08T09:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Comrade_Tuttle	might only be in the medibuntu repo?!?
2009-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	Comrade_Tuttle	ZykoticK9	So I found out its not opening it in Mplayer. I have a program called Movie Player and Mplayer (no idea why). I'm trying to just open in Mplayer to see if it will play
