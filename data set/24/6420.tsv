2005-11-02T10:52:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	yes, but I dont know the answer
2005-11-02T10:52:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	can you try stopping gdm and then starting gdm from the command line and see what happens.
2005-11-02T10:53:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	or try startx to start another xserver
2005-11-02T10:53:00.000Z	linuxgeek2	professor_chaos	GDM comes up
2005-11-02T10:54:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	but does it hang? Any messages on term1
2005-11-02T10:54:00.000Z	linuxgeek2	professor_chaos	how do I check that ?
2005-11-02T10:54:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	how are you starting gdm from the commandline?
2005-11-02T10:55:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	so if you bootup, it hangs after typing your login? right?
2005-11-02T10:57:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	try "ctrl+alt+f1" then... "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" ... then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
2005-11-02T10:58:00.000Z	professor_chaos	linuxgeek2	if no hanging there, then its not gdm
