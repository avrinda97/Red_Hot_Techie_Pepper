2007-03-01T16:29:00.000Z	K3nto		!burn
2007-03-01T16:30:00.000Z	K3nto		which burning app is best?
2007-03-01T16:30:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	cdrecord
2007-03-01T16:34:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	from the command line, you would use mkisofs
2007-03-01T16:38:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	use a graphical tool or read the man page!
2007-03-01T16:40:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	for example, gnomebaker
2007-03-01T16:40:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	i like it a lot, but they are all pretty similar
2007-03-01T16:41:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	ctrl-c
2007-03-01T16:42:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	oh, if all you want to do is make an .iso from a CD then it is trivial :-)
2007-03-01T16:53:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	i think it is kind of complicated, because the tools you would normally use will make a dvd sized image
2007-03-01T16:53:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	it is probably easiest for you to redownload the cd
2007-03-02T07:08:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	do you have universe enabled?
2007-03-02T11:08:00.000Z	K3nto	eck	can you help me out?
2007-03-02T11:08:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	with what?
2007-03-02T11:10:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	just run the script iwth bash
2007-03-02T11:11:00.000Z	K3nto	eck	how do i change to root?
2007-03-02T11:11:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	i.e. run it with sudo
2007-03-02T11:11:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	no, just sudo bash edgy.sh
2007-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	K3nto	eck	didnt work
2007-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	ok, just do this:
2007-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	K3nto	eck	let me register then we can pm
2007-03-02T11:14:00.000Z	eck	K3nto	that will basically install all the things the script would have
2007-03-02T11:18:00.000Z	K3nto	eck	PMs
