2010-05-07T20:17:00.000Z	Raptors		Does anyone know if there is a way to change?
2010-05-07T20:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 perhaps check the boxee homepage/forums
2010-05-07T20:18:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	I tired google, but didn't find anything.
2011-03-17T11:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 emerald is basically a dead project.
2011-03-17T11:46:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	what replaced it?
2011-03-17T11:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 nothing.. it died..
2011-03-17T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 emerald is so problematic. and proberly will never get fixed.. so use it if you want i guess.. good luck with getting any sypport on it.
2011-03-17T11:49:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	can you at least look at the paste
2011-03-17T11:50:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	what did they add in 11.04
2011-03-17T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 the new interface Unity revisted..
2011-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	are they as good as compiz?
2011-03-17T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 they can do  effects.. they are not the big hogs that compiz is... they have some features lacking in compiz.
2011-03-17T12:03:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	IDK what you find so great about Unity3d. It looks pretty weak. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoUTBsL7M1s
2011-03-17T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 ive not even tried it. so have no oponion on it.. it is going to be what gets pushed.. so thats the bottom line.
2011-03-17T12:04:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	maybe by ubuntu. I don't think everyone will be pushing it
2011-03-17T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 dosent really matter.. Im in #ubuntu support. :) and i imagine other disrtos will follow. or go gnome-3 wich is also going similer routes.
2011-03-17T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 thats the beuaty of gpl/linux. do what you want. I perfer function over looks.
2011-03-17T12:06:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	it doesn't look that functional. My Gnome 2.3.2 looks far more function then that
2011-03-17T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	 the operative word is 'looks' you havent tried it..
2011-03-17T12:07:00.000Z	Raptors	Dr_Willis	the whole design looks whack like the lack of minimize
2011-03-17T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Raptors	  differnt workflow/paradigm.  no need for them.
