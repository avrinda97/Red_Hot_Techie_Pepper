2010-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	gvsa123		hi there... on new lts, how can set thunderbird to replace evolution when i click on that little mail/envelope right beside the system clock?
2010-05-14T08:34:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	perhaps changing System -> Preferences -> Preferred Applications does the trick
2010-05-14T08:35:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	i set tb on that already... i tried sending a doc from OOo and it opens up tb, but it's just this one that does seem to want to use TB
2010-05-14T08:38:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	any idea?
2010-05-14T08:39:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	sorry I'm a bit slow to answer, doing homework over here :P
2010-05-14T08:40:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	oh i'm sorry... i'm checking their website too...
2010-05-14T08:40:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	sorry I'm not sure... I haven't actually used that applet myself. But I know it's ubuntu-specific, so it's not impossible it's set to only integrate with evolution
2010-05-14T08:41:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	no you're not interrupting anything, I just specified why I might be a bit slow ansering :)
2010-05-14T08:41:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	I'm gonna check gconf to see if there are any options there
2010-05-14T08:41:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	it's set to only integrate with evo - meaning i can't change it? or did you mean it's not improssible to set it to use tb?
2010-05-14T08:41:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	I'm saying I'm not sure if it can be changed or not. Gonna check now :)
2010-05-14T08:45:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	sorry seems like it isn't possible to integrate with thunderbird yet
2010-05-14T08:45:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	I didn't find it in gconf-editor, so I might be wrong...
2010-05-14T08:46:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	but a quick google yielded this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MessagingMenu
2010-05-14T08:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	i'm on that page already... looks like i'd have to contact the developers and ask them what their plans are... can't read through the whole page now, but will see about it...
2010-05-14T08:47:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	not google, I clicked the "about indicator-applet" link ;). The page lists apps integrated with the indicator applet, and the thunderbird part is still undocumented, likely meaning it's still on their TODO lit.
2010-05-14T08:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	not a biggy really, just convenient if i could work from that applet alone...
2010-05-14T08:47:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	thanks!!!
2010-05-14T08:48:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	np, I see how it could be handy :). By the way, do you know if the deskbar project is still up? I think they had a thunderbird plugin, so you could e.g. search in the thunderbird entries directly from the panel. Along with firefox bookmarks, web history, etc.
2010-05-14T08:49:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	seems like Deskbar is in the repos. You could try it out and see if it helps.
2010-05-14T08:50:00.000Z	gvsa123	jabirali	i have not run on ubuntu for quite some time... last time i used it as around 7.10 i think. xp just got hit with a virus so threw that away already... lost about a month of data there... arg!!!
2010-05-14T08:52:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	ouch that hurts... For next time, check out a linux app called Foremost. It's developed by the US Airforce to recover data from partitions with corrupted metadata, works like a charm for data recovery. (and yes it's open source)
2010-05-14T08:54:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	livecd + external harddrive for recovered data = get all your data back (although it is still a workload to discover what filenames correspond to which files, but at least you have the files)
2010-05-14T08:54:00.000Z	jabirali	gvsa123	I'm ofcourse assuming that the partition was corrupted and not just system crash - in the latter you don't need foremost ,)
