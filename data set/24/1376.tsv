2012-05-06T21:30:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	think so
2012-05-06T21:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	have you tried bootchart?
2012-05-06T21:29:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	does bootchart go that far?
2012-05-06T21:38:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	could I post a bootchart here, and see if any of the stuff that's booting is cruft?
2012-05-06T21:39:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	sure.
2012-05-06T21:40:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	this is from this morning, I don't think it shows what happens after you get to the login screen. http://imgur.com/UEdw2
2012-05-06T21:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	you have a lot of disk activity
2012-05-06T21:44:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	It's been through quite a few updates, is that what you mean? I got it about two years ago
2012-05-06T21:44:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	more so the disk seems to have a lot of activity during boot, and it is spikey so i was wondering
2012-05-06T21:49:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	hmm what does the disk access mean?
2012-05-06T21:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	in your case, i observe the disk read/write spiking at boot time and then calming down
2012-05-06T21:54:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	do you have a lot of programs during startup? things in rc.local etc?
2012-05-06T21:55:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	let me check. dropbox is the only one i can think of
2012-05-06T21:57:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	rc.local is empty, but according to "startup applications" I'm running dropbox, weather applet, redshift, and synapticks touchpad initiator.
2012-05-06T21:58:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	redshift makes the screen less blue at night to help you not stay up so late. it's kind of like f.lux
2012-05-06T22:02:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	maybe i'm slow because I'm using an old kernel? (it looks like 3.0 something)
2012-05-06T22:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	it also seems your network doesn't come up until about 50 seconds in
2012-05-06T22:30:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	which process are you looking at for that?
2012-05-06T22:31:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	the network manager and few other services that should start after network all start after that basic time
2012-05-06T22:41:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	hmm I wonder why the network starts that late... maybe that's what makes it take so long for me to get my desktop
2012-05-06T22:46:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	it looks like I have clamav-freshclam starting, but I don't even have clamav installed...
2012-05-06T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	semitones_tea	thats interesting - are you sure it's not installed? a virus update on startup seems on course with those type of writes/reads
2012-05-06T22:50:00.000Z	semitones_tea	SolarisBoy	it's not coming up as installed in the ubuntu software center
