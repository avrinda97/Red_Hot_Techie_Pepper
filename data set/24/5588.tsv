2008-04-15T14:27:00.000Z	popey	zero__	look at gnome power manager - it has options for that

2008-04-15T14:27:00.000Z	popey	zero__	in gnome System -> preferences _.power management
2008-04-15T14:28:00.000Z	zero__	popey	in there, there is NO option for screen dimming on battery power
2008-04-15T14:28:00.000Z	zero__		just about killing the display and poweringoff the machine

2008-04-15T14:30:00.000Z	popey	zero__	could be that brightness isn't supported by linux on your laptop..
2008-04-15T14:31:00.000Z	popey	zero__	..could you add the brightness applet to the panel and see fi that works?
2008-04-15T14:31:00.000Z	zero__	popey	it doesnt do anything, am i just screwed?
2008-04-15T14:32:00.000Z	popey	zero__	does it have a red cross through the brightness icon?
2008-04-15T14:32:00.000Z	zero__	popey	yeah it does
2008-04-15T14:32:00.000Z	popey	zero__	then brightness isn't supported on your particular setup
2008-04-15T14:32:00.000Z	zero__		damn, well, ok, thanks popey
2008-04-15T14:33:00.000Z	popey	zero__	there may be a fix/workaround. i dont know
