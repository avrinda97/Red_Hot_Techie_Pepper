2008-09-20T21:01:00.000Z	rampageoberon		how can i disable certain users from having ssh access yet not disable the shell
2008-09-20T21:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	Read "man sshd" and particularly "man hosts_access"
2008-09-20T21:03:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	thanks
2008-09-20T21:04:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	The form user@host is what you need, I think
2008-09-20T21:04:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	thats very helpful, i'll read through it and come back if i have any trouble. Cheers :)
2008-09-20T21:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	oops, let me try again...
2008-09-20T21:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	yeah, so everyone *but* guest IS allowed to connect?
2008-09-20T21:42:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	Hi again, i'm having a slight problem, read through the manuals and the /etc/hosts.deny needs the user@host but i can't seem to get it to work. Does it read hosts.allow first or hosts.deny?
2008-09-20T21:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	I'm not sure... let me read up on it :) (if it is like apache it does deny then allow by default)
2008-09-20T21:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	the man-page says "The search stops at the first match" and says it's hosts.allow then hosts.deny
2008-09-20T21:52:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	Okay, with the line "sshd: ALL" in hosts.deny it works fine blocks as expected, but can't get "sshd: guest@hostname" to work. Any ideas?
2008-09-20T21:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	Is that in hosts.allow ?
2008-09-20T21:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	Have you tried guest@1.2.3.4 format?
2008-09-20T21:52:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	no hosts.deny. I'm trying to stop the guest user ssh access
2008-09-20T21:53:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	not tried that format, will try now
2008-09-20T21:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	ahhh... sorry, I'm getting confudled :)
2008-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	sorry, i explain briefly. I have a guest user account which I don't want to allow ssh access to so trying to disable it in hosts.deny
2008-09-20T21:54:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	yeah, so everyone *but* guest isn't allowed to connect?
2008-09-20T21:55:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	yes to the second statement :)
2008-09-20T21:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	:) let me re-read the man page
2008-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	Did you read the section of man hosts_access titled "CLIENT USERNAME LOOKUP" - it seems to suggest the client username will be "unknown" unless the client is running an ID service
2008-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	rampageoberon	looks like identd on the client would be a solution, if that is the reason the rule isn't working as expected
2008-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	sorry, my bad, i'll read it again
2008-09-20T22:00:00.000Z	rampageoberon	IntuitiveNipple	how would i use identd as a solution?
