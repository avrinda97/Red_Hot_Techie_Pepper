2011-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	phox_		Then I guess Ubuntu is a good place to start, koobalito =)
2011-06-01T01:17:00.000Z	phox_		KM201: but can't you see how that feature would be a pro to a new comer?
2011-06-01T01:18:00.000Z	phox_		KM201: Hm, interesting point.
2011-06-01T01:20:00.000Z	phox_		koobalita, oh cool. Didn't get that.
2011-06-01T01:21:00.000Z	phox_		I have a question. Why isn't VLC on Ubuntu by standard? It's much more popular (atleast I think so) and IMO better than the random movie players we get by default.
2011-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	phox_		Monkeydust: wat
2011-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	Totem is part of of the GNOME desktop environment.
2011-06-03T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	Use it on the first archive of the series and it should extract from all of them.
2011-06-03T19:43:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	I remeber someone here saying recently that it doesn't do globbing for some reason.
2011-06-03T19:43:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	ok, so how do I solve it?
2011-06-03T19:44:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	Something like; find . -maxdepth 1 -iname "*.rar" -exec unrar {} \;
2011-06-03T19:46:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	that just listed all of the options..
2011-06-03T19:47:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	sorry, I missed the argument for unraring something. Its unrar x {]  I think.
2011-06-03T19:48:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	ok, so "find . -maxdepth 1 -iname "*.rar" -exec unrar x {} \;"? Do I need the " in front of *.rar?
2011-06-03T19:48:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	yes.
2011-06-03T19:51:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	You can always test it by using -echo ranther than -exec to see what commands it would have issued :)
2011-06-03T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	find /path/ -type d -iname "sample" -delete
2011-06-03T19:59:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	thans man, you really seem to be an expert =)
2011-06-03T20:00:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	should I replace the /path/ part? I am writing a script, and I want to delete the sample dir in the folder I'm activating the script from
2011-06-03T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	Replace /path/ with wherever you want to start searching from/ use . for current directory.
2011-06-03T20:02:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	no. It becomes:  .
2011-06-03T20:02:00.000Z	Pici	phox_	find . -etc etc
2011-06-03T20:02:00.000Z	phox_	Pici	hehe ok =)
