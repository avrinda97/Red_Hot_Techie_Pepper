2006-03-20T09:04:00.000Z	servers		y I dont have permission 2 view my NSTF partition?
2006-03-20T09:05:00.000Z	_jason	servers	pay attention to the table at the middle of the page that explains permissions
2006-03-21T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	servers	you need to mount with the right options
2006-03-21T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	servers	check the table towards the middle of the wiki page that ubotu gave you
2006-03-21T07:54:00.000Z	servers	_jason	do I have 2 install a script 2 mount it
2006-03-21T07:54:00.000Z	_jason	servers	you don't have to, you can just do it manually by following th instructions below that script part
2006-03-21T07:55:00.000Z	_jason	servers	umask=0222 works well for me
2006-03-21T07:57:00.000Z	_jason	servers	how are you mounting the drive?  are you using fstab?
2006-03-21T07:57:00.000Z	servers	_jason	system-->administration-->disks
2006-03-21T07:58:00.000Z	_jason	servers	oh, well I don't know about changing permissions there.  Just follow the wiki on setting up fstab and let me know if you don't understand something
2006-03-21T08:55:00.000Z	_jason	servers	that is not a good idea
2006-03-21T08:56:00.000Z	_jason	servers	where are you trying to copy to?
2006-03-21T08:56:00.000Z	servers	_jason	on my flash disk
2006-03-21T08:57:00.000Z	_jason	servers	strange, mine get's mounted so that I can copy as the user.  I suppose you can just use sudo though
2006-03-21T08:58:00.000Z	servers	_jason	how 2 use sudo on graphic shell ;S
2006-03-21T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	servers	'gksudo nautilus' would open it up, but make sure you don't mess with important files because you can mess stuff up.  But you should look into setting it up so that it get's mounted correctly (I don't know how)
2006-03-21T11:48:00.000Z	_jason	servers	what player?
2006-03-21T11:48:00.000Z	servers	_jason	totem
2006-03-21T11:49:00.000Z	_jason	servers	install totem-xine from unvirse and see ubotu's link above for w32codecs
2006-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	_jason	servers	test or files?
2006-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	servers	_jason	files
2006-03-23T10:59:00.000Z	_jason	servers	cp file location
2006-03-23T10:59:00.000Z	servers	_jason	and paste?
2006-03-23T10:59:00.000Z	_jason	servers	copy and paste is just cp
