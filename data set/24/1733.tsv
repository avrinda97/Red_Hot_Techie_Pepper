2009-12-15T00:04:00.000Z	Alan502		Is there any windows manager that can help me automatically set a window as "all desktops"?
2009-12-15T00:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	openbox
2009-12-15T00:04:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	do you know if open box can help me set a window as "all desktops" but only when it is placed on my second monitor?
2009-12-15T00:05:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	not sure, only have one monitor here

2010-03-07T06:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	why
2010-03-07T06:28:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	'cause upgrading ubuntu always feels good :)
2010-03-07T06:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	what does it offer that you currently need
2010-03-07T06:29:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	nothing at all, i think. But i just like to upgrade.
2010-03-07T06:32:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	what os are you currently using?
2010-03-07T06:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	gentoo on desktop, arch on netbook, debian on server
2010-10-05T06:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	get rid of pulseaudio
2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	get rid of pulseaudio
2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	sudo apt-get remove pulseadio?
2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	aptitude purge pulseaudio
2010-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	will this have any consequences? (besides fixing my problem)
2010-10-06T07:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	you'll be using ALSA instead, which in my opinion is much better and doesn't have these problems
2010-10-06T07:01:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	what about skype? do you know if it works with alsa?
2010-10-06T07:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	Alan502	i don't know offhand since i don't use skype sorry
2010-10-06T07:02:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	ok, thank you for your help!
2010-10-06T07:10:00.000Z	Alan502	blakkheim	that didn't fix my problem though :/
