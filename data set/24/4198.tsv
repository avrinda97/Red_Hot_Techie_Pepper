2007-06-17T09:48:00.000Z	niuq		how can i reinstall deluge bittorrent client? ..... because i am trying to just start the app and it just does not want to start...
2007-06-17T09:48:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	if you start deluge from the terminal, does it give any useful errors ?
2007-06-17T09:49:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	 just type deluge on terminal?
2007-06-17T09:49:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	yep, if thats the name of the program
2007-06-17T09:49:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	 yes it is
2007-06-17T09:50:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25982/    there it is
2007-06-17T09:52:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	that looks pretty bad for an error, can i ask how you installed deluge ? as its not in the ubuntu repositories
2007-06-17T09:53:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	mmm i think i just download it a package, from deluge's site or something, it worked well for a while, but suddenly it crashed
2007-06-17T09:53:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	was it a .deb file ?
2007-06-17T09:53:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	not sure if it is in the repositories
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	yes it was a .deb
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	i dont believe it is, search shows nothing anyways
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	deluge-torrent_0.5.0-0~getdeb1_i386.deb
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	ok so because you installed a deb, this is no problem :-) so sudo aptitude purge deluge, then reinstall the deb file as before
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	there it is
2007-06-17T09:55:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	ok ok i will
2007-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	ok i just tried and appears a message Error: a later version is already installed
2007-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	when i was trying to install the .deb package
2007-06-17T10:00:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	mmm i am downloading the package with apt-get, i hope it works
2007-06-17T10:01:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	still doesn't starts
2007-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	if you already had a version installed, it would need to be purged removed to remove settings
2007-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	yeah i actually did it, then i used sudo apt-get install deluge-torrent, and worked, but im still unable to start the program
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	sn0	niuq	im sorry i dont know what else to try, maybe check the deluge website/forum and ubuntuforums for more info
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	niuq	sn0	ok thx man
