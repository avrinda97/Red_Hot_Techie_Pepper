2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	wam		what do you wanna do exactly sid?
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	sid	wam	I just want to install Ubuntu. but the ubiquity installer is freezing at step 4
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	sid		When I click next on step 3 for of the ubiquity install on the livecd, it doesn't get to step 4. It says it's "Starting up the partioner" but it doesn't get past 46% on this step. What can I do?
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	wam		use the alternate CD
2007-05-19T12:34:00.000Z	sid		"May 19 18:14:54 ubiquity: Watching for question patterns ^partman-auto/.*automatically_partition$, ^partman-auto/select_disk$, ^partman-partitioning/confirm_resize$, ^partman-partitioning/new_size$, ^partman/choose_partition$, ^partman/confirm.*, type:boolean, ERROR, PROGRESS" is what it says in the terminal
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	sid		I don't have the alternative cd.
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	wam		download it
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	sid		And I can't download it since I don't have a system. :(
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	sid		My only system is this livecd.
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	wam		don't you have any friends?
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	wam		salut
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	wam		parle anglais stp
2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	sid		Isn't there a way to tell ubiquity to skip step 4?
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	sid		I tried --old-partitioner and --new-partitioner, but they both freeze at 46% when starting up the partitioner on step 4
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	wam		go to ubuntu@chat.jabberfr.org alors
2007-05-19T12:37:00.000Z	wam		 tout  l'heure
2007-05-19T12:37:00.000Z	wam		je suis l bs aussi
2007-05-19T12:38:00.000Z	sid		Is the alternative cd the same as server edition?
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	wam		sid:no
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	wam		desktop!=alternate!=server
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	sid	wam	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	sid		I don't see alternative listed.
2007-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	sid		I think I have enough RAM to download the cd and keep it in RAM via the livecd, then burn it
2007-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	wam	sid	check the box at the box "Check here if you need the alternate desktop CD. This CD does not include the Live CD, instead it uses a text-based installer." at the botton of the page
