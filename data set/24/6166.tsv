2008-01-31T05:14:00.000Z	woz		for some reason my laptop screen won't go idle/sleep even though I have it set to go to sleep after 2 minutes. anyone got any suggestions?
2008-01-31T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	woz	do you have an optical mouse?
2008-01-31T05:15:00.000Z	woz	soundray	yes
2008-01-31T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	woz	it may be sending spurious movement signals. Try unplugging it. If that works, plug it back in, but turn it on its back.
2008-01-31T05:16:00.000Z	woz	soundray	thanks ill try that
2008-01-31T05:23:00.000Z	woz	soundray	that still doesn't turn the display off
2008-01-31T05:24:00.000Z	soundray	woz	do you use the inhibit applet?
2008-01-31T05:24:00.000Z	woz	soundray	whats that?
2008-01-31T05:25:00.000Z	soundray	woz	it's a gnome applet that you can use to disable screensaving -- e.g. when you're watching a movie. I thought you might have set it to inhibit-mode inadvertently
2008-01-31T05:25:00.000Z	woz	soundray	any way for me to check that? i.e. a config file
2008-01-31T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	woz	not really -- you would probably know if you had it on your panel
2008-01-31T05:27:00.000Z	woz	soundray	is it possible that folding@home or pidgin is preventing it from going to idle?
2008-01-31T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	woz	I'd say that's unlikely
2008-01-31T05:27:00.000Z	woz	soundray	ive tried killing both of those apps and unplugging the mouse to no avail.
2008-01-31T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	woz	and you haven't got a second pointing device, like a trackpad or tablet?
2008-01-31T05:29:00.000Z	woz	soundray	only the touchpad on my laptop
2008-01-31T05:29:00.000Z	soundray	woz	ah
2008-01-31T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	woz	try installing gsynaptics and disabling the trackpad. You have to make a modification to /etc/X11/xorg.conf for it to work
2008-01-31T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	woz	I mean touchpad
2008-01-31T05:30:00.000Z	woz	soundray	alright
2008-01-31T05:31:00.000Z	woz	soundray	alright i installed gsynaptics and now im in the xorg.conf file, what should i edit
2008-01-31T05:34:00.000Z	woz	soundray	any idea what lines to edit on xorg.conf?
2008-01-31T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	woz	add this line to the InputDevice section that pertains to your touchpad: Option "SHMConfig" "true"
2008-01-31T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	woz	you will have to restart X
