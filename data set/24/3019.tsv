2008-06-10T14:10:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	looks like a python package..i there a setup.py in the dir?
2008-06-10T14:13:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	I only found one setup.pyc, and then it says http://paste.ubuntu.com/18998/ in the terminal
2008-06-10T14:14:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	install python-plistlib
2008-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	ok, thanks. come back later
2008-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
2008-06-10T14:17:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	post whole log..hard to make out from just 2 lines
2008-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	sorry, just a moment
2008-06-10T14:18:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	http://paste.ubuntu.com/19000/
2008-06-10T14:21:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2app/
2008-06-10T14:21:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	this says that py2app..the cause of your error is a mac specific thing
2008-06-10T14:21:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	you are sure that you downloaded the right thing?
2008-06-10T14:23:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	I think so, this only one link for download, will it bother you to download it yourself and check? http://www.podnova.com/subscriptions/download/   thank you very much
2008-06-10T14:24:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	ok..btw there are other podcast clients out there
2008-06-10T14:25:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	I checked some tests, and some people recommend it, so I just try to use it, otherwise I will try other one.
2008-06-10T14:26:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	is python-setuptools installed?
2008-06-10T14:27:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	yes
2008-06-10T14:27:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	i get the same error ;)
2008-06-10T14:28:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	no idea on how to resolve it...on the face of it looks like a bug in one of the packages downloaded from pipi
2008-06-10T14:28:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	the install script downloaded a bunch of packages
2008-06-10T14:29:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	really bad coding :) I'll try another one then. thank you very very much!
2008-06-10T14:29:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	np..even rthymbix has podcast support iirc
2008-06-10T14:30:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	I removed gnome and using xfce now, I'm trying to used lightweight applications. what would you recommend then?
2008-06-10T14:31:00.000Z	anirudh0	clarezoe	err...there are tons around..synaptic will throw up quite a few hits. but i've only used amarok..exaile is considered good though
2008-06-10T14:32:00.000Z	clarezoe	anirudh0	ok, I'll looking around, thank you again!
