2007-04-22T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	start what session?
2007-04-22T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	'irssi'?  'irc' should also work
2007-04-22T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	'irssi' is the comamnd
2007-04-22T12:25:00.000Z	surviver	Flannel	oke ill try that :)
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	CLI stands for Command Line Interface
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	w3m is already installed with ubuntu
2007-04-22T12:45:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	eh?  Yes.  Using a textmode browser, like we've been talking about.
2007-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	yes.  type `w3m`
2007-04-22T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	'q'
2007-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	no.  There's "centericq" which is a textmode messenger client
2007-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	right.  irssi and centericq are different ;)  centericq is for AIM, ICQ, and stuff.  irssi is for IRC
2007-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	hotmail?  What?  hotmail would be a browser
2007-04-22T12:58:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	right.  You'd use a browser (like w3m)
2007-04-22T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	surviver	You don't chat through hotmail.  hotmail is email.  Youd chat through MSN.  Which centericq does.
