2009-06-13T23:11:00.000Z	DavidePalm		Hey, I'm trying to play DVDs on Ubuntu, and I can't seem to play them... Totem Movie Player gives an internal error.  So I downloaded KMplayer, and whenever I try to open a DVD it says on the bottom (mplayer not running) or (xine not running)  Any ideas?
2009-06-13T23:12:00.000Z	DavidePalm		!dvd
2009-06-13T23:12:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	download the packages that let you play encrypted dvds. then try mplayer, it should work
2009-06-13T23:12:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	what are those packages?
2009-06-13T23:13:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	not sure offhand, but if you go to add/remove software search "dvd" it should be there
2009-06-13T23:17:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	something like libcss is what you need. the only player i found that works with this is mplayer. then in mplayer, right click and select play dvd. no fancy menu except playing by title sections
2009-06-13T23:21:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	so how do I play encrypted dvds? is there a way?
2009-06-13T23:21:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	you have to install libdvdcss2
2009-06-13T23:21:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	encripted dvds =  most regular dvds?
2009-06-13T23:22:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	once you get libdvdcss2 it should work fine. you don't need restricted extras, in fact, i don't even have them. hope it works for you
2009-06-13T23:23:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	well I"m installing the restricted extras... will they give me some other fun capabilities?
2009-06-13T23:24:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	"support for MP3 playback and decoding, support for various other audio formats (GStreamer plugins), Microsoft fonts, Java runtime environment, Flash plugin"
2009-06-13T23:24:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	so, in short, yes :)
2009-06-13T23:31:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	webpigeon_laptop, "livdvdcss2 is not available but is referred to by another package.  This may mean the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source."
2009-06-13T23:34:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	i know you're pain. they make it so hard to do...i remember that what I did was search for the package online and did manual install. it is a bit of trouble but the .deb install is automated
2009-06-13T23:36:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	here it is, dude: http://packages.medibuntu.org/jaunty/libdvdcss2.html download and install :)
2009-06-13T23:37:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	assuming you're using jaunty
2009-06-13T23:38:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	I followed the instructions on www.medibuntu.org, and I installed libdvdcss2.  I"m restarting right now let's see if it works
2009-06-13T23:38:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	cool. good luck!
2009-06-13T23:39:00.000Z	DavidePalm	ewsubach	man this is really tough... why not just include all the libs necessary with a video player that you download?
2009-06-13T23:39:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	legal reasons.
2009-06-13T23:39:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	any software that breaks the encryption on DVDs is technically illegal
2009-06-13T23:41:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	that's a good question and the answer is I don't know. i don't think it's the software, it's the libraries that decode it.
2009-06-13T23:43:00.000Z	ewsubach	DavidePalm	sweet. np
