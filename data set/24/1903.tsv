2009-11-13T16:53:00.000Z	xur1z		is there a channel for NBR?
2009-11-13T16:53:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	There are #ubuntu-mobile and you can ask questions here too.
2009-11-13T16:54:00.000Z	xur1z	leaf-sheep	i want to get NBR onto a newly purchased HP 110. the .iso won't boot when dd'd to a USB disk. moblin and sugar both boot, i'm wondering if i should use jaunty or find a .img for karmic.
2009-11-13T16:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Are you comfortable with linux? Can you use terminal and stuffs? :3
2009-11-13T16:55:00.000Z	xur1z	leaf-sheep	yep :)
2009-11-13T16:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Good network connection? Speed.
2009-11-13T16:56:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Local mirror? You mean you have your own mirror? ;3
2009-11-13T16:57:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Okay. I can help you with that. xur1z: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/karmic/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
2009-11-13T16:57:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Download boot.img.gz
2009-11-13T16:59:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Open a terminal. There are a certain path that need to be chmod first but I can't remember where so we'll go in root for hassle-free. "sudo -i"
2009-11-13T16:59:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Plug in the USB.  We do "fdisk -l" to find the path of usb device. (/dev/sdX)
2009-11-13T17:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	When we find the USB dev, we do "umount /dev/sdX" -- Then we do "zcat /home/xurl/Desktop/boot.img.gz > /dev/sdX"
2009-11-13T17:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	When you get the prompt, wait few seconds to ensure it is finished writing everything.  Now, unplug and try it on the netbook (with Internet).
2009-11-13T17:02:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	It's only 15MB file.
2009-11-13T17:02:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	11.7MB to be precise. :)
2009-11-13T17:03:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	For installation. Yes. Give the netbook a wired connection. So it can download latest packages from the mirrors.
2009-11-13T17:04:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Please use my nickname.  You don't get highlighted messages out of magic. :0
2009-11-13T17:05:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	I gave you the complete instruction. No need for mini.iso.  boot.img.gz is all you need.
2009-11-13T17:06:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	No problem. You're welcome to run things by me to ensure you're doing it correctly.
2009-11-13T17:07:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	You might get better support in #gnome since it's a part of Gnome basic integrated packages.
2009-11-13T17:16:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	Speaking of USB, I'm doing it right now because I want to do this sometimes today for the other machine. I might as well do it now. ;)

2009-11-13T18:07:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	xur1z	What took you long? ._.
