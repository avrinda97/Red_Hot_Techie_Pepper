2008-02-10T00:46:00.000Z	WaiXan		How does I save this script? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-255924.html
2008-02-10T00:47:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	copy and paste it into a text editor
2008-02-10T00:47:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	whatever you want
2008-02-10T00:47:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	No  *name*.sh or something?
2008-02-10T00:48:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	it doesn't matter, linux doesn't care about that stuff
2008-02-10T00:55:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	why do you want to?
2008-02-10T00:55:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	It's stays so in the script
2008-02-10T00:56:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	put it in /usr/local/bin/.  You'll need sudo.  Do you know how to do that?
2008-02-10T00:56:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	Nope
2008-02-10T00:56:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	what is the current path to the file?
2008-02-10T00:57:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	It's /home/zander
2008-02-10T00:57:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	/home/zander is the file?
2008-02-10T00:57:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	No /home/zander/shot is it
2008-02-10T00:58:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	sudo cp /home/zander/shot /usr/local/bin
2008-02-10T01:01:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	It didn't move
2008-02-10T01:01:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	tell me the output
2008-02-10T01:02:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	There was none
2008-02-10T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	I made it copy, not move.  So it should be there.  Now make it executable with 'sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shot'
2008-02-10T01:04:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	tell me the output of 'ls /usr/local/bin'
2008-02-10T01:04:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	you said it was called "shot", not "shoot"
2008-02-10T01:05:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	I tried both
2008-02-10T01:05:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	tell me the output of 'ls -l /usr/local/bin'
2008-02-10T01:06:00.000Z	WaiXan	jrib	'ls -l /usr/local/bin' = total 0
2008-02-10T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	WaiXan	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
