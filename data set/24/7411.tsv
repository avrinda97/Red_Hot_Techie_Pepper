2004-12-17T07:01:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	is this a local network box?
2004-12-17T07:02:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	yeah, running at home... i have a cable connection, a wireless router and a wireless card on the amd machine
2004-12-17T07:03:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	you need to forward connections to the right computer by configuring your router, have you done that?
2004-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	well you would know about it if you had done it
2004-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	what did you type to try and connect from home?
2004-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	ssh <ip address>
2004-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	local network ip address?
2004-12-17T07:05:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	ok fine
2004-12-17T07:05:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	what is happening is this:
2004-12-17T07:06:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	the connection comes in from the outside, gets to your router, and doesn't know where to go. you need to set up port forwarding to tell the router to send the connection to your desktop computer where the server is
2004-12-17T07:07:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	do you understand?
2004-12-17T07:07:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	and how would i start to do that?
2004-12-17T07:07:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	your router manufacturer gives you a webpage interface you can connect to
2004-12-17T07:07:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	you go there and set it up
2004-12-17T07:08:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	absolutely, yes, okay, now i see what you are getting at -- just like I open up bittorrent services in the night, i will have to open up ssh services, is that it?
2004-12-17T07:08:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	correct. You need to set up port 22 to go to your desktop server LOCAL address (which will be something like 192.168.*)
2004-12-17T07:08:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	thanks, will try that, right away
2004-12-17T07:08:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	you will probably only be able to do that from home
2004-12-17T07:09:00.000Z	mdke	far_away	to test the server, from your laptop you can type "ssh 192.168.*", substituting the * for the address of your desktop
2004-12-17T07:09:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	i will when I get home...
2004-12-17T07:14:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	there used to be an extension that did what you wanted
2004-12-17T07:18:00.000Z	far_away	mdke	http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/#tbe
