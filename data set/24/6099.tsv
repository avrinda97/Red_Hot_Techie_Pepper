2006-01-16T11:53:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 sorry I'm a kde kinda guy

2006-01-16T11:55:00.000Z	Joonior	Evodawg	nah
2006-01-16T11:56:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 you might try it   if your using dhcp it should start without any real info
2006-01-16T11:56:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 let me check my setup
2006-01-16T11:57:00.000Z	Joonior	Evodawg	thanks
2006-01-16T12:02:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 the only thing on my setup is the DNS servers and DHCP found those automatically. Isnt there some kind of setup in gnome/
2006-01-16T12:03:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 wish I could be of more help
2006-01-16T12:03:00.000Z	Joonior	Evodawg	ah well, thanks anyway
2006-01-16T12:03:00.000Z	Joonior	Evodawg	i thought the dhcp was meant to work straight away but maybe i didn't set it up properly
2006-01-16T12:04:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 try the google thingy
2006-01-16T12:04:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 it did on my system
2006-01-16T12:08:00.000Z	Joonior	Evodawg	i thin i figured out why my dhcp wasn't working, the gateway and dns server was set to the ip of the wireless ap or somthing :|
2006-01-16T12:10:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 you didnt say you had wireless
2006-01-16T12:11:00.000Z	Evodawg	Joonior	 that would explain it
