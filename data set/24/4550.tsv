2007-03-15T08:28:00.000Z	Kikkoman		Would someone be so kind as to help me with GRUB?
2007-03-15T08:29:00.000Z	Kikkoman		I can't access Windows XP any more
2007-03-15T08:29:00.000Z	Kikkoman		So obviously something is wrong ;A;
2007-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	Kikkoman		No no no
2007-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	Kikkoman		It's not that
2007-03-15T08:30:00.000Z	Kikkoman		I've lost Windows after installing GRUB
2007-03-15T08:31:00.000Z	Kikkoman		erm Ubuntu
2007-03-15T08:31:00.000Z	Kikkoman		I mean, when I select Windows XP Home Edition, it changes the screen, loads like, 2 lines of text, and then goes back to the GRUB menu
2007-03-15T08:31:00.000Z	N6REJ	Kikkoman	ubuntu will become the default boot OS after installing... to get to xp you have to quickly ( 5 seconds ) hit the down arrow
2007-03-15T08:32:00.000Z	N6REJ	Kikkoman	oh!
2007-03-15T08:32:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	It's not that. I mean, I literally cannot access windows
2007-03-15T08:33:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	I have a /boot folder with /grub in it
2007-03-15T08:33:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	It may help to say that Ubuntu is on the slave drive while Windows is the master.
2007-03-15T08:34:00.000Z	N6REJ	Kikkoman	this doesn't matter EXCEPT, you MUST have a "/boot" partition in that configuration and GRUB MUST live in the windows boot partition.
2007-03-15T08:34:00.000Z	N6REJ	Kikkoman	you only need about 200mb and it doesn't matter where it lives.
2007-03-15T08:34:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	Umm... How do I check the partitions?
2007-03-15T08:35:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	And I said for GRUB to be installed on hd(0,1) which is the Windows partition
2007-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	Do you know how I can change the MBR?
2007-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	To use the Windows boot loader
2007-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	N6REJ	Kikkoman	I would reinstall
2007-03-15T08:45:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	Can you guide me through the install this time?
2007-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	I have the ubuntu cd in
2007-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	Should I reinstall Ubuntu onto master HDD?
2007-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	Kikkoman	N6REJ	Or should I use the option that says "Boot from first Hard Disk"
