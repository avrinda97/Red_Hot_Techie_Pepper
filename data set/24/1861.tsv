2009-10-25T07:29:00.000Z	bazhang		ubuntu-desktop for desktop (obviously) and lamp for server
2009-10-25T07:31:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	My wireless doesn't seem to have a logical name??  Actually could you take a look at the outputs I have, I'll pastebin them.
2009-10-25T07:31:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	okay
2009-10-25T07:33:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	thanks, here it is http://pastebin.com/d38255e96
2009-10-25T07:36:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	does ifconfig show the wireless device? wlan0 or similar?
2009-10-25T07:37:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	nope, the output is in the pastebin, it shows eth0 and lo.
2009-10-25T07:38:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	what about sudo ifup wlan0
2009-10-25T07:39:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0.
2009-10-25T07:43:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	does this look like a viable solution: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=826233&highlight=aironet
2009-10-25T07:44:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	looks very promising, I was about to hit the forums and you beat me there
2009-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	I had tried something like this before, but I was more of a noob then, though still a noob now I might get this right this time, I'll try this blacklisting out.
2009-10-25T07:50:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	the forum doesn't give the full filename of the blacklist file, I have several files in that folder that are blacklists of one sort or another, do they mean blacklist.conf ?
2009-10-25T07:52:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	I think I need to restart to see if that worked, I'll report back soon.
2009-10-25T07:56:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	no luck with the blacklisting
2009-10-25T07:58:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	sorry did you see this?
2009-10-25T08:01:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	nope I did not, now I call the file my_blacklist? or with my user name like kunji_blacklist?  I can just try both.  Thanks.
2012-10-27T20:50:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	lets get back to ubuntu support please
2012-10-27T20:52:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	Sorry, I thought we were doing support, didn't someone want to know about options besides Unity?  There was like a 2 line tangent at the end...
2012-10-27T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	and it's done. lets move on please
2012-10-28T06:56:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	why would restarting a VM be moot?  The hardware is virtual, but I don't see why that would make the reasons for a reboot any less valid, no?
2012-10-28T06:57:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	the kernel modules I would imagine. I'm not sure why he does not want to simply restart the VM (which is rather what a "reboot" is here)
2012-10-28T06:59:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	Hmm, I still think the reboot is warranted for the VM.  Yeah, not sure what the objection is, some people run VMs as servers though, it could be running some service to end users (theoretically, I have no idea what his situation is).
2012-10-28T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	kunji	I've not been following his issue to be of much use, just got on my self
2012-10-28T07:00:00.000Z	kunji	bazhang	it's all good ^_^
