2006-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	that would be a tad lower in spec than this 2001 AMD1900+
2006-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	sorry :-) tabbed the wrong person
2006-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	the whole .nl infrastructure is on the move if I understood what was happening correctly
2006-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	i see
2006-07-16T09:51:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	one persons daily bread knowledge is anothers expert - please ask your real question
2006-07-16T09:54:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	if somone was to try and help you they would have to read about 6 lines of text, and you have not said you have "printer X" yet
2006-07-16T09:55:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	just tell me what info you want, and i'll supply it
2006-07-16T09:55:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	I don't know yet if I can help, what I would like to know is (A) did printing ever work and (B) what make and model have you got
2006-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	it has worked in previous distros, and lexmark x73
2006-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	did it ever with ubuntu, and now that I think of it you are using 6.06 yes?
2006-07-16T09:57:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	i have never tried it with ubuntu, and i'm using dapper
2006-07-16T09:57:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	so what are you using xubuntu, kubuntu?
2006-07-16T09:58:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	kubuntu, but with ubuntu as well
2006-07-16T10:01:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	are you able to administer cups?
2006-07-16T10:02:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	that is not how you do it in ubuntu, do this, System Administration Printing and add a printer there we don't deal with cups - that thing works (for all the printers I have pointed it at)
2006-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	just a moment
2006-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	okay it may be a usb issue as cups says it can deal with that printer, I suggest the following, turn off and unplug the printer from the PC remove the driver, turn off the PC plug the printer into the pc, start the PC and printer and then go through the setup again - it does work
2006-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	when I have install issues they seem to go away with that manover
2006-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	you can get into cups if you really want to but that involves all sorts of messing and costs lots of time
2006-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	but can you run administration tasks using cups?
2006-07-16T10:07:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	I don't since I moved to ubuntu - 11.5 years using OSS as my desktop o/s
2006-07-16T10:11:00.000Z	brandon_	ompaul	what is the "print system currently used" on your ssytem?
2006-07-16T10:12:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	and that fires off cupsys
2006-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	ompaul	brandon_	cos it is not installed?
