2008-07-09T19:11:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	sudo apt-get install firefox-locale-[enter language here]
2008-07-09T19:13:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	the package is already installed
2008-07-09T19:14:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	go here and download it as a plugin then: http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/
2008-07-09T19:15:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	but why doesn't the package work ?
2008-07-09T19:16:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	might not be the correct way... could just be the page locale
2008-07-09T19:16:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	I want the menus to be in my language
2008-07-09T19:18:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	but I don't want to download firefox
2008-07-09T19:19:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	when you see all the languages, scroll down to the bottom
2008-07-09T19:19:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	then you can download your language as a xpi file
2008-07-09T19:20:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	what do I have to do when I'm here : http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.0/linux-i686/ ?
2008-07-09T19:20:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	click xpi at the bottom
2008-07-09T19:21:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	then click the file corresponding to your language
2008-07-09T19:22:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	then, after it has been installed, you go into about:config, search for general.useragent.locale, and change its value to the language you installed
2008-07-09T19:22:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	ok, it works now. thanks for you help
2008-07-09T19:24:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	general.useragent.locale is set to en-US, but the menus are in my language (which is not english). do I have to change it to my language ?
2008-07-09T19:24:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	if it works, no
2008-07-09T19:26:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	I don't know why, but there are strange bugs in Ubuntu, that I didn't see anywhere else
2008-07-09T19:26:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	like what?
2008-07-09T19:27:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	problems with googlebar, erasure of a configuration file after an update, etc
2008-07-09T19:27:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	well, go to launchpad.net and report it if you think it's a bug
2008-07-09T19:28:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	some bugs have already been reported, but without any result
2008-07-09T19:29:00.000Z	makkbe_	gribouille	that's the open source world... things needs to be prioritized
2008-07-09T19:30:00.000Z	gribouille	makkbe_	why is it so important to patch firefox so heavily ?
