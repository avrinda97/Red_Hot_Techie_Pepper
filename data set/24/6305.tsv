2006-01-26T17:23:00.000Z	mcdenyer	anavim	i just want to play media off the net and i have gstreamer codecs
2006-01-26T17:24:00.000Z	anavim		!codecs
2006-01-26T17:24:00.000Z	anavim		hmmm. that was the wrong one
2006-01-26T17:24:00.000Z	anavim	mcdenyer	I don't remember what I did, it was trial and error until I got as many different codecs as I could find installed
2006-01-26T17:25:00.000Z	anavim	mcdenyer	basically apt-cache search for the names of the codecs and install them...

2006-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	anavim	mcdenyer	I haven't had too much luck with the browser plugins - I just download the videos and watch them from xine
