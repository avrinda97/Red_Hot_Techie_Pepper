2010-02-27T11:47:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	thats why yesterday i was switching to admin account
2010-02-27T11:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	you were using admin account on the Xorg interface? I mean there wasn't any need to in the first place
2010-02-27T11:48:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	xorg interface menas? I am using from terminal
2010-02-27T11:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	so what are you implying? still having issues with wireless?
2010-02-27T11:49:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	yes still with wireless and eth. but now i wll solve it later on by accessing docs. if faild then come here
2010-02-27T11:51:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	thnx for you and all others for helping me.
2010-02-27T11:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	hm ok
2010-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	lots of confusion with 64 bit. no clear path for 64 bit torrent download :-(
2010-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	though its not a real necessity imo to have 64bit when i386 should work globally
2010-03-22T10:28:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	I thought that 64 bit wll be much faster. thats why I am looking for 64 bit..........
2010-03-22T10:29:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	yah
2010-03-22T10:30:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	well if amd64 doesn't work on your intel 64bit then get x86_64, simple as that
2010-03-22T10:31:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	there is nothing called x86_64 on that download page :-(
2010-03-27T08:47:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	:D
2010-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	o.O
2010-03-27T08:48:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	hmm
2010-03-27T17:39:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	may be . I dont know that
2010-03-27T17:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	psycho_oreos	but then it download the os. so the basic thing remains same
2010-03-27T17:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	abhi_nav	essentially yes :) some newcomers to linux would have no clue what for example i386 is compared to x86_64.. so to make it less daunting I think unetbootin sort of incorporated that functionality
