2010-06-30T03:20:00.000Z	TheChampion		alright thanks
2010-06-30T03:21:00.000Z	TheChampion		im completely new to linux, i have no clue how to do that lol
2010-06-30T03:21:00.000Z	TheChampion		for the few seconds that my monitor allows it before dying
2010-06-30T03:22:00.000Z	TheChampion		sometimes it will let me use the computer monitor for a few minutes though
2010-06-30T03:22:00.000Z	TheChampion		explain in case i get lucky please?
2010-06-30T03:23:00.000Z	TheChampion		i dont have the money to buy a replacement atm :|
2010-06-30T03:24:00.000Z	TheChampion		ya the tv shows the windows bios etc but when it loads the live cd the tv just loses the signal
2010-06-30T03:24:00.000Z	TheChampion		i guess buying them would be my next step
2010-06-30T03:24:00.000Z	TheChampion		well sebsebseb  the computer loading screen itself, and then the option to boot from cd
2010-06-30T03:25:00.000Z	TheChampion		ya it was my default os
2010-06-30T03:25:00.000Z	idefixx	TheChampion	does you monior die regardless of resolution and such? if not try hitting crtl-alt-F1 when you see the desktop that should bring up the console and also lower the resolution in case that helps your monitor.
2010-06-30T03:25:00.000Z	TheChampion		it works fine
2010-06-30T03:26:00.000Z	TheChampion	idefixx	 is there a way to change my resolution without actually being in windows? because i cant go past the windows load screen because the files are corrupt, so im stuck using bios/setup
2010-06-30T03:26:00.000Z	TheChampion		it wont even let me reinstall
2010-06-30T03:26:00.000Z	TheChampion		well at least someone understands lol
2010-06-30T03:27:00.000Z	TheChampion		it freezes up
2010-06-30T03:27:00.000Z	idefixx	TheChampion	like i said on linux switching to the console usually lowers the resolution on windows you can boot to vga modus depending on your installed os (xp/vista/7)
2010-06-30T03:27:00.000Z	TheChampion		no it just starts loading the "required components" to run windows from the cd, and then hangs
2010-06-30T03:27:00.000Z	TheChampion		at "starting windows"
2010-06-30T03:28:00.000Z	TheChampion		i believe so :
2010-06-30T03:28:00.000Z	idefixx	TheChampion	pressing F8 when the computer starts shows you the boot menu (windows) but since this is a linux chan I guess that is kinda off topic
2010-06-30T03:28:00.000Z	TheChampion		bleh i guess id be better off buyiing a cable to use this laptop as a monitor until i can get this sorted out
2010-06-30T03:29:00.000Z	idefixx	TheChampion	also in case you have no clue what I'm talking about and when to press F8 ... keep hitting it until you see the boot menu and from there on you can choose vga mode which boots to a lower res... anyways google is your friend thats a common problem
2010-06-30T03:29:00.000Z	TheChampion	idefixx	 thanks ill try that
