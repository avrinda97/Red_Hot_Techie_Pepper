2007-11-21T12:49:00.000Z	lewi1		How would my sda2 device map out in grub? would it be (hd0,1)?
2007-11-21T12:50:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	is it a seperate disk?
2007-11-21T12:50:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	No, it's my first hard disk
2007-11-21T12:52:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	Would that be the case, then?
2007-11-21T12:54:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	open the grub.conf file and look at the location of the linux install, sda2 will be the next one
2007-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	how is your hard drive set up, dual boot?
2007-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	I'm removing a dual boot
2007-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	hmmm, thats a good one
2007-11-21T13:09:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	I removed an ubuntu 6.06 partition. that was the one that installed grub
2007-11-21T13:09:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	I want only my 7.10 partition
2007-11-21T13:09:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	i think the partition might change to sda1, and then to hd0,0
2007-11-21T13:10:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	but i dont know
2007-11-21T13:10:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	but it's at the end of the drive
2007-11-21T13:11:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	do you have any inportant data or custom shell scripts?
2007-11-21T13:11:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	it's all backed up
2007-11-21T13:12:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	delete the partition, if it kills the grub loader, reinstall, HAVE NO FEAR!!!!!!!!!!! it works, or its a learning experience
2007-11-21T13:13:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	which partition?
2007-11-21T13:13:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	alright, thanks
2007-11-21T13:13:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	im giving it a 50% chance, so dont think im telling you it will work
2007-11-21T13:20:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	I found that I just need to mount the partition I want to keep from a liveCD and then type "grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/root /dev/hda"
2007-11-21T13:21:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	great, i was worried for ya
2007-11-21T13:24:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	is cedega worth the money?
2007-11-21T13:24:00.000Z	davenull	lewi1	every penny, you can get it on a torrent too, but i bought it after i "borrowed" it
2007-11-21T13:45:00.000Z	lewi1	davenull	Yeah. I definitely should either be homeworking or sleeping now
