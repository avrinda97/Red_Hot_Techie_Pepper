2010-02-11T07:01:00.000Z	xrfang		I added a new network card in virtualbox, and ifconfig eth1 up only bring up the card but did not assign it an IP, how can I "notify" the dhcp (which is built-in for virtualbox) to assign an IP?
2010-02-11T07:02:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Virtualbox and Vmware only detect so much hardware, for example my webcam was never detected. For your hardware to operate correctly, its best to just install it on your hard drive.
2010-02-11T07:03:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Make sure your Virtualbox network lan is enabled on Windows if thats what your using.
2010-02-11T07:04:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	All right
2010-02-11T07:05:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	after reboot it seems ok.... I hoped it will get IP without rebooting :)
2010-02-11T07:07:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	You want automatic DHCP
2010-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	where to configure this?
2010-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	System > Preferences > Network Connections
2010-02-11T07:10:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Ok brb
2010-02-11T07:10:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	So wait your trying to setup a server?
2010-02-11T07:11:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Usually when you setup a Server you have a Static Ip address, The Ip address is the same as the Gatway Ip
2010-02-11T07:11:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	same as gateway ip? I don't get it...
2010-02-11T07:12:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	So for this you'll need to setup a Static Ip, sorry I didn't know you were setting up a Server..
2010-02-11T07:12:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Well, if your connecting to router, put the ip of the router sorry i was thinking of just Lan network.
2010-02-11T07:12:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	static or dynamic is not that important, because I am only studying some techniques, but I do would like to learn basic command line tools for networking, except those "commodity" tools like ifconfig or ping...

2010-02-11T07:13:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Ok thats fine. Brb 1 sec
2010-02-11T07:13:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	although I've been using linux for years, this is the first time I setup things directly on command line under ubuntu or debian based systems. :$
2010-02-11T07:14:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Ok if you configuring a DHCP address for your network card use: sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
2010-02-11T07:15:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	yes, that's what I did. but I am digging for more... for example I do like the setup program's style for configuring LVM, but can't find that program (because I don't know its name, or whether it is available) after installation
2010-02-11T07:16:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Ok so you need something to configure LVM?
2010-02-11T07:17:00.000Z	xrfang	k0rbis	yes,
2010-02-11T07:17:00.000Z	k0rbis	xrfang	Ok brb I'll look around for ya
