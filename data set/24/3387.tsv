2008-09-17T14:17:00.000Z	Popz		hello
2008-09-17T14:17:00.000Z	Popz		anyone got any ideas why "top" is only showing processes from the current user, not all users?
2008-09-17T14:18:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	are you running it like thus : sudo top
2008-09-17T14:18:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	you might also like to have a look at htop
2008-09-17T14:18:00.000Z	Popz	airtonix	no, it shouldnt need to run as root surely?
2008-09-17T14:19:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	so you have another ubuntu desktop and running top without sudo allows you to see process from all users?
2008-09-17T14:20:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	sorry i have no idea, might a feature of the server version
2008-09-17T14:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	in a server enviroment this is good behaviour though
2008-09-17T14:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	ahh right i see now
2008-09-17T14:34:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	some reason i believe epsxe did a benchmark test on my setup when i first ran it....at least i think it did
2008-09-17T14:34:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	i found a benchmark.txt in my home folder with some awesome stats
2008-09-17T14:35:00.000Z	Popz	airtonix	like what? :o
2008-09-17T14:36:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	see if its still in my trash and i will pastebin
2008-09-17T14:37:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	mmm doesnt seem to be there...but i was looking at things like disk access speeds memory speeds...all sorts of tests
2008-09-17T14:40:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	really wish i could work out what made that file
2008-09-17T14:41:00.000Z	Popz	airtonix	my old server was a dual core with 1gb ram
2008-09-17T14:43:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	that must be exspensive?
2008-09-17T14:44:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	yeah i have no idea what made that text file. I just know you would love whatever did
2008-09-17T14:55:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	yes use xMing...its the best
2008-09-17T14:56:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	xMing > all others
2008-09-17T14:56:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	it does lack session features that you might be used to with vnc/screen or freenx
2008-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	but then again...it doesnt if you use it right
2008-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	xMing is just a xserver for windows...so you setup putty for x forwarding, then you ssh to your ubuntu machine..and then any gui based prog you run will appear on your windows machine
2008-09-17T14:59:00.000Z	airtonix	Popz	faced with a sysadmin that wouldnt let me install ubuntu on 24 machines in awebdev envrioment easiest way for me to get gedit on all those machines was to use xming on them
