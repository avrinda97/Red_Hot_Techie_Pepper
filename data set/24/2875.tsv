2008-09-12T04:17:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	I think compiz and beryl combined to make compiz fusion, so there are packages from both projects
2008-09-12T04:17:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	wait what os u on?
2008-09-12T04:17:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	ubuntu 8.04
2008-09-12T04:18:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	do a sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manage
2008-09-12T04:18:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	and i know i dont have no dang 3d cube like my first install
2008-09-12T04:18:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	ok
2008-09-12T04:19:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	Because fusion comes packaged with hardy .. you just have to enable the control for it by sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-09-12T04:19:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	ah... i see um it says couldn't find package. i'll check if i added a space from copy and past :D i know i am lazy
2008-09-12T04:20:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	at the end did you copy the manage or manager?
2008-09-12T04:20:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	if its in apt-get wont it be in the package manager thingy?
2008-09-12T04:20:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	yes not suppose to?
2008-09-12T04:20:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	It should have the r at the end
2008-09-12T04:21:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	wow that makes me feel dumb ty mate
2008-09-12T04:23:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	thankyou i now got the one function i've been wanting my 3d cube
2008-09-12T04:23:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	cool, be sure to enable cube caps and set images for those so the cube at the top and bottom isn't plain
2008-09-12T04:24:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	you mean you can fix that? wow my first install i just learned to ignore it.
2008-09-12T04:25:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	Yes you can even set hotkeys to scroll through several differnt image options while your moving the cube
2008-09-12T04:31:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	um i got an image on top but none on bottom why??
2008-09-12T04:32:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	Did you set which images to load for cube caps?
2008-09-12T04:32:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	yes.
2008-09-12T04:33:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	I wasn't getting any images with mine so I had to add the image path for both
2008-09-12T04:33:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	Maybe the bottom image is linked to a non existent file
2008-09-12T04:34:00.000Z	ph0rensic	starn	or one without read permissions...
2008-09-12T04:34:00.000Z	starn	ph0rensic	i dont know.. i even tried two images think it is back ground image? some how? seeing how skydome seems to be that.
