2010-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	culinor		i don't know why, but "sudo aptitude install unrar *" removed a lot of packages before installing
2010-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	i said no asterisk
2010-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	it was a typo correction, to build off my previous statement
2010-01-05T13:39:00.000Z	culinor	ejv	i did it with asterisk, have i done any damage to my system?
2010-01-05T13:40:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	well... what did it say it removed?
2010-01-05T13:41:00.000Z	culinor	ejv	this is it http://paste.ubuntu.com/351673/ any bad news for me?
2010-01-05T13:43:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	looking now
2010-01-05T13:43:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	im not quite sure what the asterisk means to aptitude
2010-01-05T13:43:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	im referring to the documentation to see how it interprets the *
2010-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	culinor	ejv	thank you for your assistance
2010-01-05T13:46:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	documentation doesn't say much about the * in the command
2010-01-05T13:46:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	based on what i've seen, it removed some KDE support (your desktop environment ?) I'd aptitude install those packages back.
2010-01-05T13:47:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	also some xmms (music player) and some bitorrent related apps
2010-01-05T13:47:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	i don't see anything vital that would make me freak out
2010-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	you could always tell by doing a reboot
2010-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	and see if the system comes back up gracefully ;)
2010-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	sure i'll be here ;)
2010-01-05T13:52:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	cool ;)
2010-01-05T13:52:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	always give the fellas here a few seconds extra, to follow up their statements, try to avoid knee-jerk reactions ;)
2010-01-05T13:52:00.000Z	culinor	ejv	now i should use unrar through the terminal or not?
2010-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	exactly, pick one file in the set, example, unrar -e aaaa.r01
2010-01-05T13:53:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	or what Surlent777 said, unrar is available by right clicking on an archive, and clicking "extract here"
2010-01-05T14:00:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	i think the command line unrar is more useful, it will tell you which .rar is missing in a set, if there's one that's corrupt or missing, more verbose than the GUI operation
2010-01-05T14:01:00.000Z	ejv	culinor	to each his/her own though ;)
