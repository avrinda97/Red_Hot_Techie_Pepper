2006-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	jw_606		feryana?
2006-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	jw_606		I just installed Ubuntu 6.06 and it installed to the point where it says "remove cd to reboot and finish installing" I do that, my PC reboots then It goes thry the startup service check list then when it gets done with that my screen goes blank..i'm in recovery mode right now in the command prompt :(
2006-12-10T11:06:00.000Z	jw_606		Please help
2006-12-10T11:06:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	Do you have an older graphics card? That happens to me on my laptop because of dri.
2006-12-10T11:07:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	I have to go in in cmdline mode and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and comment out the dri line.
2006-12-10T11:08:00.000Z	jw_606	akk	what could i use to edit the xorg.conf file? Sorry I am a newbie
2006-12-10T11:08:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	Good question! I use vim, but there might be something easier installed (maybe someone else here knows)
2006-12-10T11:09:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	There are editors that are more newbie-friendly but I don't know what's installed by default.
2006-12-10T11:09:00.000Z	jw_606	akk	so i could just "vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf"?
2006-12-10T11:09:00.000Z	akk		Oh, right, use nano, jw_606 -- that'll be easier. nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	jw_606	akk	thank you! :)
2006-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	look for the line that says Options: dri and either delete it or put a # at the beginning of the line
2006-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	jw_606		i'll be back
2006-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	jw_606		Oh btw how to I exit IRC from the recovery console?? :)
2006-12-10T11:14:00.000Z	jw_606		It worked! Thank you akk and the other person who mentioned NANO :)
2006-12-10T11:14:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	Yay!
2006-12-10T11:14:00.000Z	jw_606		Now I need to update 6.06 to 6.10 :)
2006-12-10T11:15:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	btw, the bug on it for S3 cards is https://launchpad.net/bugs/41340 -- there are similar bugs filed for other video cards.
2006-12-10T11:15:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	In case you want to comment on it in the bug system or cc yourself or something (it doesn't look like anyone's fixing them, but maybe if a lot of people ask ...)
2006-12-10T11:16:00.000Z	jw_606		:D
2006-12-10T11:17:00.000Z	jw_606		I see that Ubuntu 6.06 doesnt have an IRC application? I had to run IRC from a terminal
2006-12-10T11:18:00.000Z	akk	jw_606	It doesn't come with xchat? There are lots of different irc clients you can install.
2006-12-10T11:18:00.000Z	jw_606	akk	I'm not seeing Xchat in the internet menu
