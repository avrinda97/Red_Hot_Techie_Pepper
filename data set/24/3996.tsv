2007-08-14T13:19:00.000Z	reallyjoel		are there hotkeys for switching desktops?
2007-08-14T13:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	ctrl-alt left or right arrow
2007-08-31T09:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	It works... but use it very sparringly...  it is a very bloated app and running as root is dangerous
2007-08-31T09:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	You might want to look into thunar or pcman for lighter file managers
2007-08-31T09:16:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Jack_Sparrow	Hmm, I cant seem to be able to copy / paste files?
2007-08-31T09:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	are you using gksudo nautilus ?

2007-08-31T09:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	Are you trying to overwrite files or just paste..
2007-08-31T09:17:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Jack_Sparrow	 the paste command is greyed out

2007-08-31T09:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	Have you used root access much?
2007-08-31T09:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	Did gksudo ask for your password?

2007-08-31T09:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	reallyjoel	I dont know why you would not be able to copy a file if you have root access..
