2010-02-23T01:26:00.000Z	jonzbcc		Hi, I'm awesomely confused -- can someone please tell me: is it bad to have /home on its own partition (say 200GB) and / on its own partition (say 30 GB) ?
2010-02-23T01:28:00.000Z	jonzbcc		disk usage analyzer reveeals that its full (100%) and the largest thing inside of it is home directory (90%)
2010-02-23T01:29:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	also make shure to unckeck the option that backups on home directory if bacckup location isn't available
2010-02-23T01:31:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	it may be on a hidden folder
2010-02-23T01:32:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	the backup? in a hidden foler on the external drive?
2010-02-23T01:32:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	in a hidden folder in you home
2010-02-23T01:32:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	try logging in in a tty and running du * -sH | less
2010-02-23T01:33:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	try logging in in a tty and running du .* -sH | less
2010-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	I'm booted into the laptop from a CD  -- I tried `du ./* -sH | sort -r | less` and the biggest stuff (coming up at the top) is music folder contents.
2010-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	that command was for running in the installed os
2010-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	fron the liveCD you can use baobab to know which is the biggest folder
2010-02-23T01:51:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	baobab reveals the same thing it did before I had rebooted: the /home direcotry is biggest, nad te biggest pocket of space in the /home directory is a tar in one of the user's ~/downloads directory. (its not my backup) --
2010-02-23T02:08:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	any clue what I should try? http://paste.ubuntu.com/381831/
2010-02-23T02:13:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	guntbert: jrib: this is my df -ah output, any ideas? http://paste.ubuntu.com/381834/ (thanks guntbert)
2010-02-23T02:14:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	mount your /
2010-02-23T02:15:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	and go to your home folder in the terminal (with cd)
2010-02-23T02:15:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	once you're there type  du -hs .*
2010-02-23T02:18:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	guntbert: jrib: it looks like baobab is showing differnt things than the command line isshowing, so I'm just going to stick to the command line? i guess? -- doing: sudo du -s /media/8ec.../*reveals about15 paths, butnone of them are the backup file.
2010-02-23T02:19:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	just type: du -hs .*              in your home folder and pastebin it
2010-02-23T02:19:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	du -hs .* | sort -r | less revealed an 8M .mozilla to be the biggest
2010-02-23T02:20:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	okay, just a sec.
2010-02-23T02:20:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jonzbcc	I'm talking about your home partition
2010-02-23T02:24:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	this is my home partition:http://paste.ubuntu.com/381842/ and this is my /home/bridget partition (the one I was in when I ran the backup): http://paste.ubuntu.com/381841/
2010-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	jonzbcc	Nitsuga	:) thanks for the help
