2011-03-12T23:57:00.000Z	stef		is there someone who can help me a little with softraid (raid1) please
2011-03-12T23:59:00.000Z	stef		i have ubuntu dekstop 10.04 installed. i created a raid-array, it works, but i want it to auto mount and auto start the array on startup, but it doesn't work.
2011-03-13T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	about autobuild in boot check /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf ?
2011-03-13T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	but it should just work afaik
2011-03-13T00:02:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	in fstab, i added this line     /dev/md0    /storage   /ext   defaults   0   0       so then last thing i have to do is auto start the disk-array ?
2011-03-13T00:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	should be ext4 not ext/ ?
2011-03-13T00:05:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	sorry, it's like you said, EXT4, when i reboot now, ubuntu says, could not mount device to /storage . that's because it's not started yes, so i only have to auto start the disk array (sorry for my english)
2011-03-13T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	check /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf ?
2011-03-13T00:08:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	this is my mdadm.conf file http://pastebin.com/K5TW3bcQ
2011-03-13T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	you may have to add the deffinition for your array ?
2011-03-13T00:14:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	so this lines would make it works http://pastebin.com/XRBaV64Q (add to mdadm.conf)
2011-03-13T00:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	probably. you can try easily...
2011-03-13T00:15:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	Thanks! it works! i searched days for this. Thanks
2011-03-13T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	no problem
2011-03-13T00:16:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	Is there a way to test if my raid1 one, like unmount one hard drive or something ?
2011-03-13T21:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	you can just do it
2011-03-13T21:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	unless you have a raid already configured ...
2011-03-13T21:59:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	i only have a raid configured with mdadm (softraid) does that count to? or do you mean only hardware raid ?
2011-03-13T21:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	i meant a raid configured in the bios
2011-03-13T22:00:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	no, I have no hardware raid, so i can just change it without losing any data?
2011-03-13T22:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	yes; that wont touch your data in any way
2011-03-13T22:01:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	and ubuntu will boot normal? sorry for all the questions, but i just saw on google that windows had a lot of problems when chaning it.
2011-03-13T22:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	stef	yes; if you choose the correct disk in the bios boot order it will boot normally and all should work thnaks to using uuids
2011-03-13T22:03:00.000Z	stef	erUSUL	Thanks for all the information!
