2008-10-30T02:26:00.000Z	ldiamond		What do you people think about that? : http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/27/1212214&from=rss
2008-10-30T02:26:00.000Z	ldiamond		Apparently, ubuntu is getting slower and slower
2008-10-30T02:26:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	tell it to the people in #ubuntu-offtopic.. *hint* *hint*...
2008-10-31T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	not sure it can be done.. unless you do it in some weird weird way
2009-05-18T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	put them in a script after each other
2009-05-18T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	by default they will be run in order.. the next one starting when the previous one finishes
2009-05-18T21:44:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	that doesnt work. I put insmod, then mount in the same file (/etc/rc.local) but the mount doesnt wait for the driver to be loaded and fails
2009-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	perhaps the module is inserted but then the driver needs a little while before it can handle requests
2009-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	my guess is insmod exits, but the driver still has to load itself fully
2009-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	what kind of driver is it?
2009-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	RAID card driver
2009-05-18T21:46:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	if you check the syslog when you insert a removable drive or similar it actually says that it is "waiting for the drive to settle down" before continuing.. I'm not sure if you can check the status of your raid card using the command line.. can you?
2009-05-18T21:48:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	I have no idea
2009-05-18T21:48:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	why not just put a 2 second sleep command between them, if that is what it takes to make it work.. or you are doing this often enough that waiting isn't an option?
2009-05-18T21:49:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	I was looking for a more elegant way to do this, this is done at boot. Jaunty boots fast, if I add 2-3 seconds (1sec is too short) it kinda defeat the fast boot...
2009-05-18T21:51:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	well.... perhaps you could just start this script and then continue with the boot process.. if you do not need the raid drive immediately for booting something
2009-05-18T21:51:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	that way it would just wait while the computer is doing the rest of the booting..
2009-05-18T21:51:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	I dont need the raid for booting, but if I add sleep in the /etc/rc.loacl file, will it block on the sleep?
2009-05-18T21:52:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	I'm not sure if the boot scripts are run in some weird way but just call your script with a & at the end and it will be forked off to background
2009-05-18T21:52:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	I'll try that, thanks
2009-06-01T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	run "sudo updatedb"
2009-06-01T01:09:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	then try again
2009-06-01T01:09:00.000Z	ldiamond	Slart	isnt that supposed to be automatic? I used to be able to locate new files in my previous installations
2009-06-01T01:10:00.000Z	Slart	ldiamond	yes.. I think it does it every time you install something.. I might be wrong though
