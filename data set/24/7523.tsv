2004-12-09T16:31:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	yes have searched for hotplug and alsa
2004-12-09T16:22:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	reinstalling hotplug is not the solution
2004-12-09T16:23:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	no, what is?
2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	lets find the error rather then reinstalling hotplug every reboot
2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	would be nice yea :)
2004-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	what kind of card ?
2004-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	it's a extigy (snd-usb-audio)
2004-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	was it recognized automatically from the installer ?
2004-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	ahh , usb
2004-12-09T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	do you have a onboard card ?
2004-12-09T16:26:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	yes, I've blacklisted the onboard since the extigy sounds better. I'm on hoary current
2004-12-09T16:26:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	hmm, hoary.....
2004-12-09T16:27:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	yes, after an upgrade of hotplug something broke I think
2004-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	if your sound doesnt work, have you had a look in the loaded modules ?
2004-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	oh yes it works
2004-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	but stops working after each reeboot
2004-12-09T16:28:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	the blacklisting too ?
2004-12-09T16:29:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	i had issues with blacklisting a sound module in the ordinary /etc/hotplug/blacklist file , i had to use /etc/hotplug.d/alsa-base
2004-12-09T16:30:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	I made a personal blacklist file, /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/myblacklist seems to work
2004-12-09T16:31:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	hmm, seems hoary related....have you had a look at bugzilla ?
2004-12-09T16:33:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	do you think I should open a bug? I'm able to recreate the symptoms at each bootup and solve it in a way
2004-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	yep, do it ... and have a look at the loaded modules dirctly after boot, before you reinstall hotplug and then compare them to the modules loaded later
2004-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	anders_	ogra	ok
2004-12-10T17:13:00.000Z	ogra	anders_	great ;)
