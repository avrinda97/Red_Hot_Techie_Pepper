2005-06-16T07:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	that's because Firefox is stupid ;)
2005-06-22T05:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	you're reccomending cfdisk? ;)
2005-06-22T05:57:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	then suggest something better.  i like cfdisk :)
2005-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	I use cfdisk meself, but QTParted better for the person not liking Command Line
2005-06-22T05:58:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	got a url?
2005-06-22T05:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	yeah, only 1 chapter is made insofar, though
2005-06-22T06:02:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	seems it is still in very early stages ;)
2005-06-22T06:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	obviously ;)
2005-06-22T06:02:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	you might want to check tldp.org for something similar...
2005-06-22T06:02:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	this is aimed more for the Ubuntu user
2005-06-22T06:03:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	heh, cool
2005-06-28T10:22:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	what error does it give you?  you probably want \left\{ and \right\} instead of \{ \}
2005-06-28T10:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	lemme copy and paste it, hold on
2005-06-28T10:23:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	and i didn't know about \textrm, i thought it was \mathrm{}~
2005-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	that's what I did before, I removed the ' ' afraid of a compiler error
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	you need tabs to have screens on multiple machines :-P
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	you can't use multiple terms? ;)
2005-08-08T13:23:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	same difference
2005-10-18T09:58:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	looks more like 23 hours 59 minutes to me
2005-10-18T09:59:00.000Z	pestilence	Razor-X	not on the same day it isn't
2005-10-18T09:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	pestilence	oh, I didn't see the start and end
