2006-09-23T07:06:00.000Z	CzarAlex		Can I chat with other users logged in to my box via the ssh shell?
2006-09-23T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	write command
2008-09-21T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	Make sure the files (and folders) are readable by the www-data user (this usually means everyone)
2008-09-21T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	Folders being "readable" also means they need to be +x
2008-09-21T07:07:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Ah okay.  Let's give that a try.
2008-09-21T07:08:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Folders are 755 and chmod`ed +x. No results.
2008-09-21T07:09:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	And the files?  (755 implies +x)
2008-09-21T07:10:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Yes. I'm receiving The requested URL /~mahoney was not found on this server. (with mahoney as the user) as the error.
2008-09-21T07:10:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	I believe /home/mahony/ will also need to be o+x
2008-09-21T07:11:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	is that 777?
2008-09-21T07:11:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	no, 755 will work
2008-09-21T07:11:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Hmm. It already is.
2008-09-21T07:12:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	Alright.  And /home/mahoney/public_html/ is too?
2008-09-21T07:12:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Correct.
2008-09-21T07:13:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	Hmm, and `ls -l /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ | grep userdir` outputs stuff?
2008-09-21T07:13:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	nothing actually.
2008-09-21T07:13:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	Ah, that'd be your problem then.  Do this: sudo a2enmod userdir && sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload
2008-09-21T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	You didn't have the userdir module enabled (which is what handles the public_html stuff)
2008-09-21T07:14:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	two separate commands right?
2008-09-21T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	If you just copy that whole thing, the && will take care of it
2008-09-21T07:14:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	wonderful
2008-09-21T07:15:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	Perfect. Thank you very much!
2008-09-21T07:15:00.000Z	Flannel	CzarAlex	glad to help.  You might be also interested in: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions which will cover how to convert between numbers and letters and stuff
2008-09-21T07:16:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Flannel	That`ll definately help. Thanks again.
