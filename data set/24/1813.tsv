2009-08-10T11:23:00.000Z	pnordico		could anyone here upload a default grub menu.lst to me?
2009-08-10T11:23:00.000Z	pnordico		anybody?
2009-08-10T11:25:00.000Z	pnordico		cmon
2009-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	pnordico		isn't there any ubuntuser here with the -14 kernel that could do that for me?
2009-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	something wrong with your own menu.lst
2009-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	nothing, I just need a default one from ubuntu with the *-14 kernel
2009-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	sorry, I don't even know what a *-l4 kernel is...
2009-08-10T11:28:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	2.6.28-14-generic (that's better?)
2009-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	did menu.lst change from 2.6.24-24-generic? That's what I'm running...
2009-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	hm... don't think so... may i have a look at it? ( pastebin.com )
2009-08-10T11:30:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	I don't see why not. No warrany express or implied, though...
2009-08-10T11:31:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	fine, I just need to take a look at it's content
2009-08-10T11:32:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	have at it -- http://pastebin.com/f7dd7bb15

2009-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	what are you going to do?
2009-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	hm...
2009-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	testing some stuff...
2009-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	like... hm... how could I say...
2009-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	fine, you don't have to tell me. I just thought I might be able to help....
2009-08-10T11:39:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	I'm trying to make the ubuntu kernel works into other distro
2009-08-10T11:40:00.000Z	losher	pnordico	it probably won't work, but if you want to try it, go ahead...
2009-08-10T11:40:00.000Z	pnordico	losher	probably...
