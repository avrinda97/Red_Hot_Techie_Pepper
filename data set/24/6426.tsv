2005-12-23T16:11:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	it's the core of an operating system. it handles the system calls, acting as a mediator between the hardware and userspace programs
2005-12-23T16:11:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	it's a philosophical question really =)
2005-12-23T16:13:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	now suddendly, everybody is an expert ;-)
2005-12-23T16:13:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	yea, it seems people learn really fast ;) hehe ;)
2005-12-23T16:14:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	it's the board in your PC box to which you attach all the other stuff. it handles the traffic inside tha machine
2005-12-23T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	i wouldn't recommend that
2005-12-23T16:15:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	why not? LOL XD
2005-12-23T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	stick to kernels :)
2005-12-23T16:15:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	oh, so I eat kernel?
2005-12-23T16:16:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	of course. every good meal has some kernels in it. not necessarily operating system kernels but perhaps wheat or something =)

2006-01-06T10:33:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	gaim usage depends on... well, usage.
2006-01-06T10:34:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	lots of IM buddies, less irc stuff -> gaim. otherwise, a decent irc client and bitlbee
2006-01-06T10:35:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	iirsi rules for irc :) but just wait :)
2006-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	gaim, gaim, gaim, and gaim all the time :P
2006-01-06T10:39:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	lol
2006-01-06T10:39:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	mind you, i don't even use it but i did use to :)

2006-01-06T10:57:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	do not suggest usage of gaim :)
2006-01-06T10:58:00.000Z	topyli	Pygi	i'm not! he's using it already :)
2006-01-06T10:58:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	ok, then don't encourage him to use it :P
2006-01-07T16:52:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	huh, not the Gaim one again :P
2006-01-07T17:27:00.000Z	Pygi	topyli	do not argue with dapper :P
