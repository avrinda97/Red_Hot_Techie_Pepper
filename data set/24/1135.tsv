2010-06-27T04:01:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	as root you can
2010-06-27T04:02:00.000Z	Uboy	iceroot	How?
2010-06-27T04:02:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	sudo -i  and then  passwd theusername
2010-06-27T04:03:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	maybe sudo passwd username   is also working
2010-06-27T04:04:00.000Z	Uboy	iceroot	when i type sudo -i, the system want form me the password and when i insert that, system say password wrong
2010-06-27T04:04:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	then insert the correct password
2010-06-27T04:05:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	its the password from your current logged in user
2010-06-27T04:05:00.000Z	Uboy	iceroot	i know, but the system does't accept this!
2010-06-27T04:05:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	but you are logged in with the user and password
2010-06-27T04:06:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	so i am sure you have misstyped the password, using capslock,different keyboard-layout or something like that
2010-06-27T04:07:00.000Z	Uboy	iceroot	I'm surprised, the main problem and joke is here, in login window, the system dont wanna me the password, but in any command after login and sudo, want me!
2010-06-27T04:07:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	you have autologin enabled as it seems
2010-06-27T04:09:00.000Z	Uboy	iceroot	ok, but waht can i do now?
2010-06-27T04:09:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	remember your password
2010-06-27T04:09:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	have a look at /var/log/auth.log about th error-message
2010-06-27T04:09:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	sudo wants your user-password
2010-06-27T04:10:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	cat /var/log/auth.log
2010-06-27T04:10:00.000Z	iceroot	Uboy	and look for the error from sudo
