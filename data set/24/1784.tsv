2010-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	cmp		to that extream you are sooooooooooooo busy people on here
2010-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	cmp		really ????
2010-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	cmp		ok
2010-01-31T20:49:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	you misunderstood. if english is not your native language, you can join a channel that speaks it.
2010-01-31T20:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	then maybe you should learn some linux basics :)
2010-02-07T22:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	what is it?
2010-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	i have 2 hard disk in my laptop and when i open it i find folder called ( lost-found) and i cant get in and i cant delete it so i want help to open and delete it
2010-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	lost+found is part of the ext filesystem, just leave it  alone
2010-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	ok thanks
2010-02-07T22:24:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	how to know if my graphic is working fine ??
2010-02-07T22:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	i think it would be pretty obvious to you if it wasn't working
2010-02-07T22:26:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	do you think there was a need for such answer ??????
2010-02-07T22:27:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	i didnt ask you to tell me what you think - i asked you and it was to help me by guiding not by showing off your knowlage
2010-02-07T22:27:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	what i meant was that if your graphics card wasn't working, your screen would possibly be flickering or have a messed up resolution or have display artifacts. the fact that you haven't complained about anything like that makes it likely that you aren't having graphics issues
2010-02-07T22:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	you're talking to a bot, bro :(
2010-02-07T22:29:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	so what was the problem if you could answer so simply like this --- without being cold answer
2010-02-07T22:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	with the way you behave, you're lucky anyone has helped you at all. no one is paid to help people here, we do it in our free time.
2010-02-07T22:31:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	 so because you are not getting paid, then you dont care about guiding in easy or difficult way ?
2010-02-07T22:32:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	do you think iam happy when i get here to ask for help -
2010-02-07T22:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	cmp	i think you should just drop it now
2010-02-07T22:34:00.000Z	cmp	blakkheim	every time i come here i know that i will have a trouble with some body - do you know why ? coz every time i ask for help - people here think that i their experience should be transfared  to the other by default ...as if this is the normal life - and people should understand it - what about the people who need to learn - HAVE you Walked once you came to this life from the first moment ---- help should be taking a hand - and go step by step
