2009-10-13T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 err.. i go tone of those...  they are built in to the defaults...
2009-10-13T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 i just plug it in.. and it works...
2009-10-13T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 what version of ubuntu you using?
2009-10-13T20:52:00.000Z	intok	Dr_Willis	no it doesn't it only finds the driver for the IP6000D, and using that gets bad colors and no black channel
2009-10-13T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 odd.. it  it prints the test pages fine here.  im on 9.10
2009-10-13T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 let me check it again..
2009-10-13T20:56:00.000Z	intok	Dr_Willis	thats the only thing mine prints right, everything else ails to print properly
2009-10-13T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 printing a web page now...
2009-10-13T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 i rarely use the thing. :)
2009-10-13T20:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	  the thing is all goofed up. file a bug i guess...  colors are 'inverted/negative' and  i get NO black text at all.
2009-10-13T20:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 theres a lot of settingss to goof with also i saw.. but i dont have the time to play with them.,

2009-10-13T20:59:00.000Z	intok	Dr_Willis	same thing I get
2009-10-13T21:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 i really really HATE that canon printer.. i plan on NEVER buying another canon. this thing likes to think i got the ink carts in teh wrong slots.. whenthey are not. :(
2009-10-13T21:02:00.000Z	intok	Dr_Willis	yah, I got it so I could get decent prints direct from the camera
2009-10-13T21:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 i found its cheaper to go to walmart or cvs and use their stuff :)  wife just had to have THIS printer.. and ive hated it since she boght it.
2009-10-13T21:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 greyscale color mode = prints totally blank pages.
2010-05-30T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 Hmm. my 8800gtsxxx works very well here.
2010-05-30T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 No idea. Ive had it for ages.
2010-05-30T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 its the lower ram model. one of the first  ones that came out i recall. It cant do the vpdau stuff i recall
2010-05-30T12:04:00.000Z	intok	Dr_Willis	then it's a G80, mine is a 320Mb from EVGA, refrence design, fhqwhgads then... possibly the chipset? It's an nforce 680i LT from XFX
2012-06-01T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	intok	 how about winff?
