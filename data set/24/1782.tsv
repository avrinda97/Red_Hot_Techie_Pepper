2009-08-26T08:38:00.000Z	Ammo		Hello, I am new to Ubuntu, and I have not tried to install yet, but I am thinking of formatting my vista based PC (Laptop) for Ubuntu, I was wondering if there was a list of laptops that would have supported drivers built in to ubuntu?
2009-08-26T08:39:00.000Z	Ammo		Which one is ubuntu live? The one that boots from the disk drive?
2009-08-26T08:39:00.000Z	Ammo		Can you give me a link? I only see 9.04 and server edition
2009-08-26T08:39:00.000Z	Ammo		Or is there a version I can boot off a 8GB flash drive?

2009-08-26T08:40:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	i believe there is a list on the Ubuntu.com site of compatible laptops as well for reference
2009-08-26T08:40:00.000Z	Ammo	Bukoden	Do you know where the link is, I tried looking but maybe im not so savy?
2009-08-26T08:40:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	one sec, i will see if i can find it
2009-08-26T08:41:00.000Z	Ammo	Bukoden	I thank you very much. =]
2009-08-26T08:43:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	i am currently using and HP Pavillion zd800 and it works great
2009-08-26T08:44:00.000Z	Ammo	Bukoden	Madh2, Let me look I will find out in a minute.
2009-08-26T08:47:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	i believe it will find the drivers needed just fine
2009-08-26T08:47:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	and work without problems*
2009-08-26T08:48:00.000Z	Ammo	Bukoden	Is there something built into Ubuntu to find them on the internet automatically? Or do the come with it? Either way I can find them myself, I did it when I had XP on it. xD ALSO, I was always curious, does Ubuntu run .exe's? Like can I install some of my games like tron and stuff?
2009-08-26T08:49:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	if finds them automaticaly, and you can get a program called wine to run any .exe programs
2009-08-26T08:49:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	without WINE or other such program, .exe will be useless
2009-08-26T08:52:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	do not need photoshop, GIMP is freeware version and almost exactly the same
2009-08-26T08:53:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	all in all, i suggest Ubuntu as you can find most programs you need for free and with ease(especially using ubuntu site)
2009-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	wine creates a false c:\ drive to run windows extensions through such as .exe
2009-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	Ammo	Bukoden	Alright. I am going to install it. I will def be back soon.
2009-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	you can install a partition for Ubuntu
2009-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	it is an option given when talling
2009-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	yes, it allows you to choose that as an option
2009-08-26T08:59:00.000Z	Bukoden	Ammo	i only recently installed Ubuntu on my laptop and am loving it
