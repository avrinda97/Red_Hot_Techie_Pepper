2005-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	coz		here is the file http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/pY03sC20.html
2005-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	snowowl		try this "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2005-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	snowowl		be careful coz
2005-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	coz		I know how to get to the file I don't know what to put in the file
2005-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	coz		thanks for th note of cuation but I have already broken this 5 times and recovered
2005-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	coz		I need a real solution to this
2005-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	snowowl		I really don't know the problem - but If you describe it i can tell you exactly what to put
2005-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	coz		I have tried the forumn pages and they all say about the same thing without any reference to the xorg editing
2005-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	coz		or very little about it
2005-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	coz	gnomefreak	what does that mean exactly?
2005-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	snowowl		be specific coz what is the problem
2005-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	coz		Ok when the nvidia drivers are installed I cannot get into the system.
2005-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	coz		I have to uninstall the drivers
2005-11-30T07:10:00.000Z	coz		but the problem is inthe xorg files refering to the chipset intel driver  shown here     http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/pY03sC20.html
2005-11-30T07:10:00.000Z	snowowl		ok, you should have said that - have you commented out the "load glcore" and "load dri" lines
2005-11-30T07:11:00.000Z	snowowl		in fact all you really have to do is this at the command line - one sec
2005-11-30T07:12:00.000Z	snowowl		"sudo nvidia-glx-config enable"
2005-11-30T07:12:00.000Z	coz		If someone would look at this file and tell me what it is I have to change to get the video card working    http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/pY03sC20.html
2005-11-30T07:13:00.000Z	coz		I haven't tried that but it still refers to the onboard video and not the card
2005-11-30T07:14:00.000Z	snowowl	coz	- try changing line 2 to this "Drivier nvidia"
