2008-02-25T13:36:00.000Z	WGGMk		Is there a way to disable usplash so that I can use splashy instead???? (Gutsy amd64)
2008-02-25T13:37:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	id be careful, installing splashy on my machine caused it to corrupt grub unrepairably, i had to do a fresh install
2008-02-25T13:37:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	I would think grub and the bootsplash are separate aren't they?
2008-02-25T13:38:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	no, splashy is a program that can let you customize the boot loading process (afaik) so it has control of grub settings aswell
2008-02-25T13:39:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	I believe your thinking of startup-manager
2008-02-25T13:39:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	no im not
2008-02-25T13:39:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	splashy should have nothing to do with GRUB
2008-02-25T13:39:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	it was just a warning anyways, make a backup first
2008-02-25T13:40:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	splashy can let you put a background screen to the grub menu, so it does have access to grub settings
2008-02-25T13:40:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	now that you mention.. I have this utility called Kronos that makes images of systems.. so that you can re-image entire systems with current configs.. kinda like firewire imaging on MAC's.. but I usually do it after installing and getting setup before tinkering with things
2008-02-25T13:41:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	seriously though.. you might be thinking of Splash Screen Manager
2008-02-25T13:41:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	lemme find the site im thinkin of,.,.hang on
2008-02-25T13:42:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	i cant find the one i was looking for,.,.but this might interest you -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/splashy/+bug/92276
2008-02-25T13:42:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	this is some starter info on Splashy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splashy
2008-02-25T13:43:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	thanks for the link.. ill read on that.
2008-02-25T13:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	the wiki link u gave me, has a link to the splashy home page, where i found this line -- Make sure that you have “vga=791 splash” as kernel parameters. You can add this to /boot/grub/menu.lst or /etc/lilo.conf. See the FAQ section for more. see "grub"
2008-02-25T13:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	on the wiki link, go to splashy home page, and follow installation instructions
2008-02-25T13:44:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	aye, however I don't use 1024x768 16bit I use a higher bootsplash resolution
2008-02-25T13:45:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	that was my prob,. im sure my vga doesnt = 791 so i changed it and it broke my system
2008-02-25T13:46:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	my trouble isn't installing splashy.. that's already done along with my theme.. the issue im having is usplash (the ubuntu default) overrides my splashy.. so I need to disable it
2008-02-25T13:47:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	i believe its a 'quiet' parameter in the boot line -- here you go -- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=575708
2008-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	yes
2008-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	WGGMk	Bodsda	ill give it a shot then
2008-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	WGGMk	hope you have better luck then i did
