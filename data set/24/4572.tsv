2011-12-11T07:42:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	ppa is a deb its just a unoffical repo it will install via apt-get
2011-12-11T07:43:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	or in this case update
2011-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	excelsior		so I'm downloading the .deb at the moment, is that supported?
2011-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	yes you can do it with a deb
2011-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	3rd party debs are unsupported officaly
2011-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	excelsior		everytime I deal with a ppa I have to look up how to set it up again. the .deb is from mozilla.com
2011-12-11T07:45:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	most ppa sites have the commands just copy and past
2011-12-11T07:45:00.000Z	excelsior		yeah, but .deb's are simpler, just download and doubleclick.
2011-12-11T07:45:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	and 11/10 you just click it and it adds
2011-12-11T07:45:00.000Z	excelsior		ok, so what's the ppa?
2011-12-11T07:46:00.000Z	excelsior		I assumed the .deb would be in the tar.bz2...
2011-12-11T07:46:00.000Z	gogeta	excelsior	no debs are compressed aruldy taring it would be redundent
