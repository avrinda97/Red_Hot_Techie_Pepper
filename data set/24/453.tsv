2012-01-13T04:17:00.000Z	DoctorD		How i start a software that i installed with Ubuntu Software Center and doesn't appear in the Applications MENU?
2012-01-13T04:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	dpkg -L packagename | grep bin is the very low level way
2012-01-13T04:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	yes, dpkg -L swftools | grep bin
2012-01-13T04:20:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	i typed that command in the terminal and doesn't appear nothing on my screen..
2012-01-13T04:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	are you sure it was named 'swftools'?  Are you sure you installed it?
2012-01-13T04:21:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	yes, swftools
2012-01-13T04:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	try sudo apt-get install swftools
2012-01-13T04:22:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	swftools is already the newest version
2012-01-13T04:23:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	if it not works..or isn't anyway to use it...what other swf decompiler is available ?
2012-01-13T04:23:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	which swfextract
2012-01-13T04:23:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	what do you mean ?
2012-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	it's a command: which swfextract
2012-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	what should i do with it? i typed and : /usr/bin/swfextract
2012-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	okay, so it's installed, but for some reason dpkg -L is failing, odd
2012-01-13T04:25:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	the executable names match the names in bold here: http://www.swftools.org/
2012-01-13T04:25:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	alright..
2012-01-13T04:25:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	what're you trying to do exacdtly?
2012-01-13T04:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	swftools doesn't make that quite as easy, IME
2012-01-13T04:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	you might want to use Wine with a win32 app
2012-01-13T04:27:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	alright..i'll use wine.
2012-01-13T04:27:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	not saying you can't do it with Unix utils, but it'll be less "easy"
2012-01-13T04:28:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	i understand and i know..it will be a day when i will be able to use the terminal more then the GUI
2012-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	alkafoo	DoctorD	maybe you should install software on yourself
2012-01-13T11:35:00.000Z	DoctorD	alkafoo	haha =)) i'm invincibile...mega extra big firewall
