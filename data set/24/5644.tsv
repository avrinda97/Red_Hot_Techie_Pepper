2006-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		libpst?
2006-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		you mean readpst?
2006-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		NVU isn't anygood for coders
2006-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		it rewrites your code
2006-08-05T07:44:00.000Z	Linuturk		www.aptana.com mrak
2006-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Linuturk		i've pasted plenty of clean code into NVU, and it's formatted it
2006-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Linuturk		the option to disable that formatting doesn't work
2006-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Linuturk		www.aptana.com is a better solution
2006-08-05T07:47:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	gosh, it's using font tags? yuck
2006-08-05T07:49:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	isn't that the point though - don't most wysiwyg editors rewrite code a bit? - personally I've never used a wysiwyg editor to develop websites, because they usually can't render things properly anyway (considering the myriad of rendering engines actually used)
2006-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	okay, the designers at work use dreamweaver, we use a mixture of eclipse and homesite (coldfusion developers)
2006-08-05T07:52:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	dreamweaver is pretty good (I have Studio 8) but I'd rather support open source then pay all that money for each release. I've never used eclipse. I do mostly PHP mySQL
2006-08-05T07:53:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	oh well, definitely give eclipse a go :).. flex builder 2.0 (by adobe/macromedia) was just released and that's using the eclipse framework with some customisations for flex
2006-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	aptana has been released as a plugin for eclipse ;p
2006-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	got a specific package to install for eclipse? what packages are a must have?
2006-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	there are also css, html, php plugins for eclipse with content-assist
2006-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	I believe 3.1 is still in the repositories.. on the eclipse website you can grab 3.2
2006-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	where are those css, html, php plugins?
2006-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	in the repos?
2006-08-05T07:59:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	probably not in the repos..but maybe.. I haven't looked in the repos for them
2006-08-05T08:00:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	i don't see them in the repos, they must be on the eclipse site?
2006-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	snoops	Linuturk	I use eclipse with the ruby and css plugin mostly.. absolutely love it :)
2006-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	Linuturk	snoops	i think i'm going to let aptana mature
