2007-02-16T07:27:00.000Z	babo	Sanne	ahh ... thanks ...
2007-02-16T07:27:00.000Z	Sanne	babo	you're welcome :)
2007-02-16T07:28:00.000Z	Sanne	babo	but follow this page, and if you already have the driver package installed, you will get output accordingly.
2007-02-16T07:28:00.000Z	babo	Sanne	I've a new computer, so nvidia-glx should be OK right ?
2007-02-16T07:29:00.000Z	Sanne	babo	I think so, but there's a link to a text file that lists hte cards that need the legacy driver. Check to be sure.
2007-02-16T07:29:00.000Z	babo	Sanne	how do I find out what my card is ?
