2011-02-26T11:32:00.000Z	raido	amit	did you implement a 64bit environment
2011-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	raido	amit	Right thats the virtual server software, but when you "build" the virtual hardware for the virtual machine did you make a 64 bit machine
2011-02-26T11:38:00.000Z	raido	amit	Im not sure but I know you can define the hardware specs for the VM that you want to build
2011-02-26T11:44:00.000Z	raido	amit	no way to know from here
2011-02-26T11:45:00.000Z	amit	raido	thanx
2011-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	amit	raido	this problem is perhabs discussed in this link plz see if you get some point help me as m unable to understood much more https://partner-bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=605566
2011-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	raido	amit	see ubottu^^^ are you current?
2011-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	amit	raido	yes m using beta version
2011-02-26T11:56:00.000Z	raido	amit	I wish I could help but you are asking a Red Hat question in a Ubuntu channel and your running beta software... your above our pay--grade
2011-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	amit	raido	no m asking it as ubuntu user as m using my ubuntu as host OS and i installed virtual box withu ubuntu s/w centre so guys its an ubuntu question
2011-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	amit	raido	the basis of this question is why virtual box OSE not installing OS of 64 bit ?
2011-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	raido	amit	Virtual Box does not allow 64bit virtual machines
2011-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	amit	raido	r u sure
2011-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	raido	amit	OSE is limited to 32bit
2011-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	raido	amit	you should have noticet that when you chose the host system specs for the VM you created
2011-02-26T12:02:00.000Z	amit	raido	but when m installing it from s/w centre it is showing it for x86-64
2011-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	raido	amit	Dude, thate because your machine is 64 bit. It will only allow you to build 32bit VMs
2011-02-26T12:03:00.000Z	amit	raido	then what to do to use 64 bit on any virtual box
2011-02-26T12:04:00.000Z	raido	amit	Pay money to Virtual Box or use another VM
2011-02-26T12:12:00.000Z	raido	amit	I think you done understand that if you have a 64 bit machine you install 64bit packages "virtualbox-ose_64.deb" than you can install 32 or 64 vit VMs on the virtual host
2011-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	amit	raido	ok
2011-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	raido	amit	you have a 64 bit computer, you will allways (well..) install 64bit packages on it.
2011-02-26T12:14:00.000Z	raido	amit	but as far as the virtual host goes, pick your choice.
