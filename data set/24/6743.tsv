2006-01-21T11:13:00.000Z	tim		i can't seem to mount my NTFS partition, where are the logs saved for mounting disks?
2006-01-21T11:14:00.000Z	trappist	tim	dmesg
2006-01-21T11:14:00.000Z	tim	trappist	thanks
2006-01-21T11:14:00.000Z	tim	trappist	nothing seems to be in dmesg :-/
2006-01-21T11:15:00.000Z	trappist	tim	well what happens when you try to mount
2006-01-21T11:15:00.000Z	tim	trappist	nothing happens -- no errors or anything
2006-01-21T11:15:00.000Z	tim	trappist	just when i tried to boot ubuntu this morning it said "mounting local filesystems : failed" and i couldn't access it.
2006-01-21T11:15:00.000Z	trappist	tim	how are you trying to mount? how do you know it's not mounted?
2006-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	tim	trappist	by typing mount -a in console and trying to "enable" it in the disks manager
2006-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	trappist	tim	try sudo mount -a ntfs and see what happens
2006-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	tim	trappist	"mount: can't find ntfs in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2006-01-21T11:16:00.000Z	trappist	tim	what does 'grep ntfs /etc/fstab' say
2006-01-21T11:17:00.000Z	tim	trappist	"/dev/sda1       /media/sda1     ntfs    umask=0222        0       0
2006-01-21T11:18:00.000Z	trappist	tim	what about 'sudo ls /media/sda1'
2006-01-21T11:18:00.000Z	tim	trappist	actually i seem to have gotten it working, turns out the mountpoint magically deleted itself for some reason, thanks
2006-01-21T11:40:00.000Z	trappist	tim	yes, but that's a Bad Idea
2006-01-21T11:40:00.000Z	tim	trappist	i'm not running on a multiple user server, or any high-security anything. just a desktop and the passwords are annoying : - /
2006-01-21T11:41:00.000Z	trappist	tim	yeah security can be annoying, but I won't be a party to opening your system to people who would use it to send me spam and waste my bandwidth
2006-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	tim	trappist	i'm running behind another firewall with telnet/ssh disabled on this machine
2006-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	trappist	tim	in that case, man sudoers
2006-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	tim	trappist	thanks
2006-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	trappist	tim	and search for NOPASSWD
2006-01-21T11:52:00.000Z	tim	trappist	so in sudoers i'd put in "tim kyoto = NOPASSWD: *" to allow me to run all commands?
2006-01-21T11:53:00.000Z	trappist	tim	I've said as much as I'm willing to say on that issue :)
