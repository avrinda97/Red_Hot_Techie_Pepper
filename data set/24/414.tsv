2011-09-25T03:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	yeah in development next release.
2011-09-25T03:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	here is the release you could dual boot t if you wanted to. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricReleaseSchedule
2011-09-25T03:33:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	thanks ... Gnome 3 is not stable yet, anyway
2011-09-25T03:37:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	How stable is Oneiric?
2011-09-25T03:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	I would not not use it as a regular system is the general idea with a development.
2011-09-25T03:38:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	I've been using *nix since '03 ... presently running Gentoo and Slackware on laptops, desktops, workstations, and servers.
2011-09-25T03:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	you might have no problems I haven't.
2011-09-25T03:39:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	A buddy who used to be a Slacker but now runs Ubuntu told me months ago "you can get Gnome 3 for 11.04."
2011-09-25T03:39:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	It was my first install and I didn't want to mess with it.
2011-09-25T03:40:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	Now we have Ubuntu (from that install in June) on my wife's PC, and then last night I installed it on this new ThinkPad T420.
2011-09-25T03:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	there is a ppa for gnome 3 if your game to do it in natty.
2011-09-25T04:45:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	don't think you need Ctrl ... just Alt+PrtSc+{R,S,E,I,S,O,B} ... or whatever options
2011-09-25T04:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	thats' the rumor ethier works.
2011-09-25T04:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	I think the soft reboot is sometimes different per keyboards, the wikipedis says the key combo you suggest, but reisub.
2011-09-25T04:51:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	I'm an old timer remembering RSEIUB ... raising skinny elephants is utterly boring ... but the kernel source (where is it in Ubuntu) has a file sysrq.txt which explains it well
2011-09-25T04:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	cool thanks. :D
2011-09-25T04:51:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	reisub ... different for different situations rather than kbds
2011-09-25T04:52:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	where *is* the kernel source? I feel naked!
2011-09-25T04:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	mingdao_	found this one seems apropos  Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken
2011-09-25T04:54:00.000Z	mingdao_	urlin2u	that's right ... good ... thanks, I'd forgotten that acronym
