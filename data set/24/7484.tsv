2004-11-16T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	are you sure ubuntu doesn't include drivers for that?
2004-11-16T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	ignore device manager
2004-11-16T07:48:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	I had the wrong files for U's kernel. Now I have something different
2004-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	sorry - meant ociN:
2004-11-16T07:51:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	that command returns "too few arguments"
2004-11-16T07:52:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	can you give more details ?
2004-11-16T07:52:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	tx for the diff. between patching / building.. there's 2 versions of that drivers' support how-to
2004-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	never mind, found it in synaptics
2004-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	right
2004-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	make sure it's the exact right version, though
2004-11-16T08:14:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	/lib/modules/2.xx.xx-xx/modules.usbmap doesn't list the vendor id, so I assume the driver is not compiled
2004-11-16T08:14:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	erm, is the module in /lib/modules/ or not?
2004-11-16T08:15:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	not sure how I can verify that
2004-11-16T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	find /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name "*whatever*"
2004-11-16T08:53:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	which name?
2004-11-16T08:54:00.000Z	bob2	MagicFab	yes, pmount uses it
2004-11-16T08:56:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	is there any config file for pmount that I can specify the name I want for my device ?
2004-11-16T10:12:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	found out how to change the language
2005-11-08T09:55:00.000Z	MagicFab	bob2	!tell is a shortcut with information linking to the wiki etc
