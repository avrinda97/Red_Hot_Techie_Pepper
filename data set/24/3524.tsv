2008-11-15T05:31:00.000Z	aross1		any cairo-dock users that could help with an odd icon problem?
2008-11-15T05:31:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	cairo-dock is awesome ;)
2008-11-15T05:32:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	yes, but cairo-dock is tricky when it comes to icons, you have to specify them directly, path-wise
2008-11-15T05:33:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	yes, this is a problem with the way cairo-dock tracks the applications running
2008-11-15T05:33:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	for example, to get it to focus thunderbird, i have to put in the cairo-dock launcher 'thunderbird-bin' but i actually run it with
2008-11-15T05:33:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	thunderbird %U
2008-11-15T05:34:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	b/c a lot of times the name of the application running doesn't match this executable
2008-11-15T05:34:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	simply, when you right click on a cairo-dock launcher, you get 'modify launcher' or something like that
2008-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	this is where i put thunderbird-bin, under command to run, or something like that
2008-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	then, when thunderbird is running, i don't have a separate icon
2008-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	just the highlight under the launcher
2008-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	the problem is, thunderbird won't launch from thunderbird-bin
2008-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	just check using the ps command, like ps -AF, it will tell you the t
2008-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	'true' name an application is running under
2008-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	i'm not classing my applications
2008-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	i just keep the ones i use all the time, i.e. firefox, thunderbird, etc..., i.e. the ones that i never shut off
2008-11-15T05:37:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	in the main toolbar
2008-11-15T05:37:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	i just right click on the cairo-dock bar and do "+add manual launcher"
2008-11-15T05:37:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	it works well for me, the applications i use *all* the time are always there
2008-11-15T05:38:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	yeah, it's buggy in that respect
2008-11-15T05:38:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	i like it because it doesn't, ever, crash, and looks a lot nicer than a panel dedicated to running applications
2008-11-15T05:38:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	that, and it works in metacity, looks like garbage, but it works, so that if compiz crashes, i still have a little access
2008-11-15T05:39:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	but i don't get rid of my gnome panel, i keep that on top, i just use the cairo-dock to keep track of running applications, because trying to keep then in the taksbar using alltray crashes when switching window managers
2008-11-15T05:40:00.000Z	rdw200169_	aross1	good luck!
