2009-11-10T04:42:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		i have a xp system that i put ubuntu on, it just boots to windows, should i try to fix, or reinstall?
2009-11-10T04:43:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	what did you use to install ubuntu? the cd? or is it a virtual ubuntu?
2009-11-10T04:43:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	cd
2009-11-10T04:44:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	so when you run the computer, does it go into the boot menu with windows and ubuntu on it?
2009-11-10T04:44:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		no boot menu
2009-11-10T04:45:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	when you ran the live cd did you actually click the "intall" icon?
2009-11-10T04:45:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	i have done dual boot innstall before, this is the first time with 9.10
2009-11-10T04:45:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	i have done dual boot innstall before, this is the first time with 9.10 , made custom partitions
2009-11-10T04:45:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	is there any way that you can re run the cd and re install the system?
2009-11-10T04:46:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		yes, its probably easier than fixing it huh
2009-11-10T04:46:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	and did you decide to install ubuntu boot on MBR or the custom partition you made
2009-11-10T04:46:00.000Z	Anditosan		?
2009-11-10T04:46:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	custom partition
2009-11-10T04:47:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	partition = root 10 gb, 2gb swap, 20 gb home
2009-11-10T04:47:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	that's the problem, because your custom partition has no way into getting in the MBR list. i recommend that you install ubuntu booting into the MBR. It's the easiest
2009-11-10T04:48:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	how exactly ? use "side by side" option?
2009-11-10T04:49:00.000Z	Anditosan	JoeSomebody	very likely, I think that ubuntu chooses to put the boot file on the MBR byb default, so you wouldn't need to do anything special
2009-11-10T04:54:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	THIS SUCKS i cant do it, it wants to wipe out windows, or my data drive
2009-11-10T04:55:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	that is one reason i went custom before
2009-11-10T04:55:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	it puts my data drive as sda, which is wrong
2009-11-10T04:56:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		IF i have to unplug my data drive that is very unfriendly
2009-11-10T04:59:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		anyone, do i pick use the largest contigous free space? and if so will windows be ok or not?
2009-11-10T05:05:00.000Z	JoeSomebody		ok thx
2009-11-10T05:28:00.000Z	JoeSomebody	Anditosan	you still here?
