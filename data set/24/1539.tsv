2009-11-26T17:50:00.000Z	munsking		can someone tell me why i cant execute a home made command with sudo? i changed the $PATH in bashrc of root and my own user
2009-11-26T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 try using sudo /full/path/to/command ?
2009-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 'should' work.. but DOES it work?
2009-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 check echo $PATH  be sure its in your path.
2009-11-26T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 the dir /home/username/bin  is in the users default path if it exists also.
2009-11-26T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 you could also link /root/bin to /home/username/bin if you wanted to
2009-11-26T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 its possible its how sudo handles the path for security reasons
2009-11-26T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 i see a similer issue here.
2009-11-26T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 'colortest.sh' works but 'sudo colortest.sh' does not.
2009-11-26T17:54:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	well i put my scripts in /home/scripts instead of in the bin directories, then i edited bashrc of both my user and root and i wrote "PATH=$PATH:/home/scripts" at the end of it, it works when executing as my own user and as root, but not with sudo somehow
2009-11-26T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 i was thinking some things got moved to .profile and not .bashrc  ALSO i think that 'sudo' does not rerun/read the bash configs for root.  'sudo echo $PATH' shows the proper path here
2009-11-26T17:56:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	tnx :)
2009-11-26T17:57:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	$ sudo echo $PATH
2009-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 its not useing it however. :) thats interesting. It may be a security feature of sudo
2009-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 in /etc/sudoers file i notice a line ---> Defaults        env_reset
2009-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	me confused xD well i guess i'll put it in another place then
2009-11-26T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 I think sudo uses some safe defaults.. that may be the whole issue
2009-11-26T18:00:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	yea i saw that too, but i dont dare to change the sudoers file xD (still a noobie)
2009-11-26T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 use the full path, or link from /bin/whatever to /home/bubba/bin/whatever as a work around I guess
2009-11-26T18:02:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	yea i could do that, but i want to share this script later on. it's an installer script for warzone2100 :)
2009-11-26T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 theres also that gpl-steam like tool called dlj (or djl) that can install warzone on a per user basic :)
2009-11-26T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 check out --> http://en.djl-linux.org/
2009-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	munsking	Dr_Willis	ah is that something like synaptic?
2009-11-26T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munsking	 its like a gpl 'steam' :)
