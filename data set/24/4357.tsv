2011-01-24T03:29:00.000Z	SAM__		yes yeats i booted in with ubuntu running on 2gb
2011-01-24T03:29:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	on 2gb of hd space or 2gb of ram?
2011-01-24T03:29:00.000Z	SAM__		hd
2011-01-24T03:29:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	how big is the whole hd?
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	SAM__		its 500gb
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	SAM__		im trying to make ubuntu use the rest of the 500gb
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	what's on the rest of it?
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	SAM__		nothing, i want to destroy the other partitions, create a swap of 2-3 gb
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	SAM__		and the rest will be for system use
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	and the system is remote?
2011-01-24T03:30:00.000Z	SAM__		yes the system is remote
2011-01-24T03:31:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	okay, it can be done, but very carefully because if something gets buggered up, someone's going to have to be there to bail you out on the other side
2011-01-24T03:32:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	so if you don't have someone there, take care of that first.
2011-01-24T03:32:00.000Z	SAM__	yeats	whats impressive? lol
2011-01-24T03:33:00.000Z	SAM__		gnea there is the datacenter on the other side
2011-01-24T03:33:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	so there is someone there that can help you out?
2011-01-24T03:34:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	just because it's a datacenter doesn't always mean someone's going to be there 24/7
2011-01-24T03:34:00.000Z	SAM__		gnea it is staffed 24/7 i host with superb
2011-01-24T03:34:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	ah okay, didn't know that
2011-01-24T03:34:00.000Z	SAM__		lol yeats i dont want to pay them!
2011-01-24T03:34:00.000Z	SAM__		i installed with debootstrap
2011-01-24T03:35:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	well, you can use fdisk to make the changes, and then format the partitions and setup your /etc/fstab
2011-01-24T03:35:00.000Z	Gnea	SAM__	if you do it right, you can reboot it and it should all fall into place
