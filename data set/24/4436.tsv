2007-04-15T14:59:00.000Z	grondinm		anyone at all?
2007-04-15T15:00:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	you can use the nvidia-glx package (or maybe legacy if you have older card)
2007-04-15T15:01:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
2007-04-15T15:02:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	you'd need to reconfigure xorg to use nvidia driver...
2007-04-15T15:03:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	so i can use the nvidia-glx and it shoudl wrok fine...but if i want to use the actual driver from nvidia i would need to reconfigure xorg
2007-04-15T15:03:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	either way you should reconfigure...
2007-04-15T15:04:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	so if i install glx from the add/remove then what would i need to do?
2007-04-15T15:04:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	run: "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-04-15T15:05:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok thanx...so if i want to use the driver from nvidia how would i got about installing that?
2007-04-15T15:05:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	it's a wizard that will guide you, although you might have things to ask, however, choose nvidia as driver (instead of 'nv')
2007-04-15T15:06:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	thanx man i will try it right now
2007-04-15T15:06:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	i'm looking at it and it's .run file so you would just make it executable (chmod +x filename) and run it ./flename
2007-04-15T15:06:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok can it be run from within X
2007-04-15T15:06:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	although I always install the ubuntu package (from repositories)
2007-04-15T15:07:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	yes, but then you have to restart x for things to start work
2007-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok so what would you recomend...that i use the nvidia driver or the glx?
2007-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	I suggest the glx driver from synaptic/(add/remove)
2007-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok so if i want to use beryl would i need the nvidia driver or will it work with just glx?
2007-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	yes it will work with glx.. (I use compiz, but that is just the same thing...)
2007-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok so i will install the glx from add/remove then what was the command i needed to run again?
2007-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-15T15:11:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	ok thank you for your help
2007-04-15T15:11:00.000Z	kane77	grondinm	np
2007-04-16T16:23:00.000Z	grondinm	kane77	are you still here?
