2007-02-24T17:49:00.000Z	sha1sum		okay well here's _MY_ question, hehe:  I've installed herd4 of feisty successfully... what I would like to know, though, is if changing packages installed while using the livecd has any effect on the packages installed using ubiquity
2007-02-24T17:49:00.000Z	sha1sum		?
2007-02-24T17:49:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	nope
2007-02-24T17:50:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	is there an equivalent of "priority=medium" in ubiquity?
2007-02-24T17:50:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	ubiquity just copies the image to the disk
2007-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	Installation is the same for both, this is a fine channel.
2007-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	so I'm guessing that the minimal install is a little larger heh
2007-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	eh? what?
2007-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	(than usual)
2007-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	why would minimal be larger?
2007-02-24T17:52:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	nevermind I phrased the question wrong... I was basically thinking that there was a smaller minimal installation available.  Anyway, is feisty also going to support the debian-installer or not?
2007-02-24T17:53:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	Of course.  Alternate CD has the debian installer (with packages), minimal CD is debian installer (without packages)
2007-02-24T17:53:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	nice :D thanks
2007-02-24T17:53:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	they'll both download updated packages from the interblags during install though.
2007-02-24T17:54:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	I just don't like the whole "pre-configured feel" of ubiquity for some reason, even tho I think it will be great for entry-level
2007-02-24T17:55:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	I'm a straight debian user if you take 'most time spent' into account
2007-02-24T17:55:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	so I'm all about as many options as I can get hehe even if I leave them at default
2007-02-24T17:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	yeah, well, most people who want to just install prefer the alt CD anyway, not having to boot first, etc.  Alt/Minimal CD have a few install options (full desktop, CLI only), but I don't believe ubiquity is less optionful (except in LVM, etc), assuming you're doing a full desktop install
2007-02-24T17:58:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	okay.  Never have done an Ubuntu install, but I was looking at ways to "complicate" (I guess would be the word) the install, and debian-installer run with the "priority=low" or "medium" boot options looked promising for more customization
2007-02-24T17:58:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	I suppose you can enable "expert" mode on alternate CD.  But really, there's... not really any benefit to doing so.  You'll just defer your OS installation
2007-02-24T17:59:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	gotcha... good to know
2007-02-24T17:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	any config you can do there, would probably be better served after installation (well, unless you need to specify hardware parameters to get it to work)
2007-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	sha1sum	Flannel	actually feisty detected everything perfectly on a somewhat-new laptop (Sony VAIO VGN-N130G) -- even found the drivers for the control device and other sony-specifics)
2007-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	sha1sum	right. They're pretty good at doing that
