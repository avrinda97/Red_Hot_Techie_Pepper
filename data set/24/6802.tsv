2005-07-26T16:51:00.000Z	pdg		could anyone give me a hint why the NVidia support doesn't work at my Ubuntu?
2005-07-26T16:52:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	how did you install the driver?
2005-07-26T16:52:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx et al.
2005-07-26T16:54:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	what does glxinfo | grep direct give you?
2005-07-26T16:55:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	direct rendering: Yes
2005-07-26T16:55:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	well technically you are hardware accelerated!
2005-07-26T16:56:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I know, and that's the weird part! Depending on the moon phase it works or it doesn't!
2005-07-26T16:57:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	could that be a hardware problem?
2005-07-26T16:57:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	what card do you have?
2005-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	I have a very similar card and it worked for me. Did you actually try a 3d game>
2005-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	and it works well in windows?
2005-07-26T16:58:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I have no windows
2005-07-26T16:59:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	did you connect the power cable?
2005-07-26T16:59:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	:)
2005-07-26T16:59:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I'm sorry, was that a serious question?
2005-07-26T16:59:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	well I forgot it once!
2005-07-26T05:01:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I'm going to turn this off and check for loosely plugged cards
2005-07-26T09:15:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	3d doesn't work?
2005-07-26T09:15:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I moved the NVidia to a windows PC, and it works fine, so it's not a hardware problem (at least not with the card)
2005-07-26T09:16:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	now I'm trying an ATI
2005-07-26T09:16:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	desrt: AHA!
2005-07-26T09:16:00.000Z	frank_	pdg	really? wow I have a FX 5900XT which is almost the same as yours and have had no problems
2005-07-26T09:17:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	I'm afraid it's a motherboard problem
2005-07-26T09:22:00.000Z	pdg	frank_	FireGL is about 1.5 years old now, I think
