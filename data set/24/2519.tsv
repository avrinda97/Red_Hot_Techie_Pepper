2009-06-12T10:00:00.000Z	Ap0llo		hello is there anyone out there that can help me?
2009-06-12T10:01:00.000Z	Ap0llo		can someone help please im having a /home issue on my laptop with 9.04
2009-06-12T10:02:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	Just ask your question.  Perhaps someone will know the answer and assist you.
2009-06-12T10:02:00.000Z	Ap0llo	rob_p	its pretty complicated for me to say
2009-06-12T10:03:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	Well I don't know what to tell you then, if you can't even explain the issue.  Good luck with it though!
2009-06-12T10:03:00.000Z	Ap0llo		but for some reason when i log in i just get a background image and a mouse cursor
2009-06-12T10:03:00.000Z	Ap0llo		to show that something is running i print scren
2009-06-12T10:04:00.000Z	Ap0llo		and when i save it says cannot access /home
2009-06-12T10:04:00.000Z	Ap0llo		i can type the full error
2009-06-12T10:04:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	Sounds like your user's home directory is not accessible.
2009-06-12T10:04:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	What change(s) did you make recently that may have caused it?
2009-06-12T10:05:00.000Z	Ap0llo		I did an alternative install since i installed via the alternative iso
2009-06-12T10:05:00.000Z	Ap0llo		i run a 64 bit OS on my laptop which is a lenovo t400
2009-06-12T10:05:00.000Z	Ap0llo		this was just a regular install and i think it has to do with the LILO
2009-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	Why would you think that?
2009-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	Ap0llo	rob_p	its just an assumption since i cant find out what started the issue
2009-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	Ap0llo		ive installed oses on this machine before so this is the first time ive come upon this
2009-06-12T10:07:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	LILO is a bootloader.  Your system is booting, correct?
2009-06-12T10:07:00.000Z	Ap0llo	rob_p	it boots up properly i believe, doesnt show a list at all
2009-06-12T10:08:00.000Z	Ap0llo		just says LILO booting Linux and then it boots up the OS
2009-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	I'd investigate the issue of the home dir not being accessible.  LILO is fine.
2009-06-12T10:09:00.000Z	Ap0llo	rob_p	well then i can type out the error i get when saving a screen shot
2009-06-12T10:10:00.000Z	rob_p	Ap0llo	Gotta step away for a bit.  But pastebin the error and if someone hasn't helped you by the time I return, I will assist then.
2009-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	Ap0llo	rob_p	, soreau this is the error i get "Impossible to save the screenshot to file:///home/Name/Desktop/Screenshot.png   Error was Error opening the file <location of screenshot>:permission denied. Please choose another location and retry
