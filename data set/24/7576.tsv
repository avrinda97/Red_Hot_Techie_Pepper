2005-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	bob2		it's generated when you install X
2005-01-30T11:18:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	yep, but i've installed a new vidcard since then
2005-01-30T11:19:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-02-11T09:15:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	no
2005-02-11T09:15:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	:(
2005-02-11T09:15:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	that's the installer.  everything else (ubuntu-desktop) is downloaded off a mirror.
2005-02-11T09:15:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	fsck..
2005-02-11T09:15:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	i wont have an internet connection when i netboot :-/
2005-02-11T09:16:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	then you need to setup a netboot system (tftp, dhcp and the netboot files off a ubuntu mirror) and a copy of the cd as your local mirror to install from.
2005-02-11T09:16:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	right, so like an ftpd on my desktop along with tftpd, dhcpd, etc ?
2005-02-11T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	well, I'd go with http, but yeah
2005-02-11T09:17:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	natch
2005-02-11T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	note that the warty cd does not contain enough stuff to setup a netboot server
2005-02-11T09:20:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	right, so i need to essential grab all of the pkgs from a mirror and toss them on my desktop machine right?
2005-02-11T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	no
2005-02-11T09:21:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	ok :-/
2005-02-11T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	you need a cd or a local mirror to install from.  in addition, you need to copy a bunch of files (maybe 5MB worth) off an ubuntu mirror and setup your tftp server to serve them.
2005-02-11T09:23:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	well.. right.. i wont have a cdrom on the machine im installing ubuntu on, so i'll need a local mirror.  theres the netboot files i've already grabbed in preparation of the install off the ubuntu website, but i need to create a mirror on the desktop machine as the local mirror yes?
2005-02-11T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	mount the cd on another machine and serve the root of the cd via ftp/http
2005-02-19T14:04:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	yeah
2005-02-19T14:07:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	is there a way to get more info out of dpkg-buildpackage when the patch fails?  i can't seem to get anything consistent in the documentation..
2005-02-19T14:09:00.000Z	bob2	jmhodges	does it manually apply?
2005-02-19T14:10:00.000Z	jmhodges	bob2	well, hrm.. i just realized that i had some more issues at hand here..
