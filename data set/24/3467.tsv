2010-03-07T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Krangam: in $HOME yes, they hold the configs for you apps and desktop
2010-03-07T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Kangam: in $HOME/Desktop I have none too
2010-03-07T12:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Frind: try diabling IPv6 too
2010-03-07T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Brad_: could use xorg.conf
2010-03-07T12:52:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	will the nvidia-settings just be editing the xorg.conf? What am I looking for in specific to change
2010-03-07T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	as long as the app runs it'll be fine
2010-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	add the medibuntu repo and install libdvdcss2
2010-04-27T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	i just told you how to fix it
2010-04-27T05:25:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	where do i find libdvdcss2
2010-08-28T22:51:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	wanted to say, that sudo apt-get update and sudo-apt-get upgrade fixed the problem with update manager and software center not running
2010-08-28T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	nice, glad you got the gold
2011-05-13T11:53:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	that still doesnt give me the option to upgrade
2011-05-13T11:54:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	Severian I installed 10.10 because i can not use liveUSB with 11.04 (there is a bug with my brand of flashdrive), the only way for me to get 11.04 is to install 10.10 and upgrade from there
2011-05-13T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	check the upgrade notes and use the server method. Its super easy
2011-05-13T11:57:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	how do i do that?
2011-05-13T12:03:00.000Z	brad_	ActionParsnip	i followed the instructions, and it still says there is no upgrades or updates available
2011-05-28T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	it's ok
2012-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	that is offtopic here
2012-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	its not an ubuntu support question
2012-11-23T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	then tell them to try a different desktop to Gnome. The colour of their skin is irrelevant
2012-11-23T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brad_	got you how...
