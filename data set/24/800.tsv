2011-06-18T15:41:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	: i did this to install my BUC written software. sudo cp ~/fileA/program.mc /usr/bin.   next, i want to have the programA.desktop file in menu
2011-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	please dont ask me to use deb. given up tring to use it. besides, i am trying to make the dependencies in .deb files to be installed together
2011-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 you copy various .desktop files to a users  home like -->  /home/willis/.local/share/applications  if you want the user to have an icon.  theres a system wide directory for a similer task.
2011-06-18T15:46:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	when i put the .desktop there, where will the icon come in the menu? i am using gnome classic btw
2011-06-18T15:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 its supposed to - yes.
2011-06-18T15:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 thats also where all the wine apps get their icons put :)
2011-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	i tried putting it in ~/.local/share/applications, but it doesnt seem to be in my menu. what did i done wrong? and here is the setting in my .desktop :
2011-06-18T15:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 you may need to somehow refresh the menus.
2011-06-18T16:41:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	: but it didnt work. cp: cannot stat `/home/ihsan/recordmykeyboard-0.1.10-installer-pack/main-installer-file/shortcuts/recordmykeyboard.desktop': No such file or directory .what might be the prob/
2011-06-18T16:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 there was no need for your user to use sudo to copy a file to their own home.
2011-06-18T16:42:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	: ok, but why cant i copy the file. this is the path taken directly from "location"in nautilus /home/ihsan/recordmykeyboard-0.1.10-installer-pack/main-installer-file/shortcuts/recordmykeyboard.desktop
2011-06-18T16:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 why not just drag/drop it via nautilus?
2011-06-18T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 looks like you got some typos to me then. or a differnt username...
2011-06-30T23:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	inashdeen	 you want someone to spend like 6+ hrs walking you through it?
2011-06-30T23:56:00.000Z	inashdeen	dr_willis	no seriously, i went through all that guides, i just got blurred.
