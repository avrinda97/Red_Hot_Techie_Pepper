2008-01-16T11:08:00.000Z	zax_		Alright, I need help....
2008-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	zax_		i just got this IRC client, and when i go into any other room i cant see anyone talking, even if there are people in there...
2008-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	zax_		what?
2008-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	zax_		...
2008-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	what channels
2008-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	zax_	bazhang	very literally, anyothers....
2008-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	zax_		like at all.
2008-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	zax_		Any channel in the Ubuntu server works
2008-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	for example?
2008-01-16T11:11:00.000Z	zax_		example: server ircnet #chat
2008-01-16T11:11:00.000Z	zax_		nothing works.
2008-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	a real example would be helpful; can you access #fedora ?
2008-01-16T11:12:00.000Z	zax_		lemme try...
2008-01-16T11:15:00.000Z	zax_		so
2008-01-16T11:16:00.000Z	zax_		i tried to do '(forward slash)join #fedora) and it said 'You need to be identified to join this channel"
2008-01-16T11:16:00.000Z	zax_		I am such a noob, how?
2008-01-16T11:16:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	how about #suse ?
2008-01-16T11:17:00.000Z	zax_		that worked i am in suse,
2008-01-16T11:17:00.000Z	zax_		but i cant see what anyone is saying despite having 230 users...
2008-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	some of those channels are less busy; ask a question and wait a few and see if you get a response
2008-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	zax_		so 232 people are simultaneously away?
2008-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	many are idle
2008-01-16T11:19:00.000Z	zax_		I already tried asking and waiting in four different rooms...
2008-01-16T11:19:00.000Z	bazhang	zax_	many of them are dead--it is the middle of night for many of them
