2005-06-24T10:31:00.000Z	lancer285		how do I switch run levels in ubuntu? I tried sudo init 3 and nothing happens
2005-06-24T10:32:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	are you sure??
2005-06-24T10:32:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	what says "runlevel" command?
2005-06-24T10:32:00.000Z	lancer285	prego	I want to be able to install my nvidia drivers, can't do it while X is running
2005-06-24T10:33:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	I see, but check that X11 is not at runlevel 3, btw.
2005-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	cannot try it myself since I'm working... despite of chatting :-P
2005-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	btw, are you using apt repositories for nvidia or just using the nvidia installer directly?
2005-06-24T10:36:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	I've not yet used nvidia+ubuntu but I would try first with repositories nvidia drivers, I guess that you don't have to change your runlevel at all.
2005-06-24T10:36:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	just restart Xserver once the upgrade has completed (and perhaps check before the /etc/X11/xorg.conf)
2005-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	lancer285	prego	okay, thanks.
2005-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	also check the wiki site, perhaps there is specific informaiton
2005-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	since when??
2005-06-24T10:37:00.000Z	lancer285	prego	since I installed it. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday. Had LOTS of probs
2005-06-24T10:38:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	it has never worked?
2005-06-24T10:38:00.000Z	lancer285	prego	no, I cannot open Firefox. It just says 'starting firefox' then it quits
2005-06-24T10:38:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	I would fix the problems prior to any nvidia driver installation.
2005-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	reinstall it.
2005-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	the firefox I mean, of course.
2005-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	also try with epiphany,...
2005-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	btw you have installed flash plugin?
2005-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	and are you using composite extension? (well, have you got it enabled at xorg.conf?)
2005-06-24T10:41:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	-it is not enabled by default, so I guess that everything is OK)
2005-06-24T10:41:00.000Z	lancer285	prego	are you whispering to me?
2005-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	prego	lancer285	no... what do you mean?
