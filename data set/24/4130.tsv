2007-07-05T11:31:00.000Z	DaltonS	Mediahunter	some hardware DVD players will play computer files (mp3, avi, vcd etc)
2007-07-05T11:32:00.000Z	DaltonS		I won't ever buy another dvd player again. Not with 500 gig drives being under 100 dollars :D
2007-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	Mediahunter		ok, well i will give them a try thank you you have been very helpfull
2007-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	DaltonS		Mediahunter,
2007-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	Mediahunter		have you used the 64bit version of 7.06 yet
2007-07-05T11:33:00.000Z	Mediahunter		or distro 7.06
2007-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	Mediahunter		daltons you are right but i have to be able to play the dvd for my kids on  a convential tv system still
2007-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	DaltonS	Mediahunter	 look and see if your dvd player will play CD's. If it's only a 700 meg video file, you might be able to squeeze it onto a cd and save some cash.
2007-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	Mediahunter		most of them break the cd size
2007-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	Mediahunter		some are around the 850megs range
2007-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	Mediahunter		they are dvd rips without the menus and extra and some are cam version from the thearthers
2007-07-05T11:35:00.000Z	DaltonS	Mediahunter	aww. too bad. CD's are pennies a piece now adays. Just a thought :D
2007-07-05T11:36:00.000Z	Mediahunter	defrysk	those are software that will do it
2007-07-05T11:36:00.000Z	DaltonS	Mediahunter	should look into seeing if you can build a medium-end computer with a T.V. out and just play the files locally. That way you can lock down what they watch and when they watch it, or you can stream one file across the network so you can play any DVD anywhere.
