2005-10-19T08:27:00.000Z	bloodnik		Me again :/
2005-10-19T08:28:00.000Z	bloodnik		For some reason, if I install ftpd on my server, I can't connect to it, I can't run it, and I can't get a manpage for it.
2005-10-19T08:28:00.000Z	bloodnik		Is there a better alternative to ftpd that actually works? :\
2005-10-19T08:28:00.000Z	bloodnik		No GUI
2005-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	bloodnik		There's pro-ftpd but IIRC that's harder to use
2005-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	pureftpd
2005-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	that might have a hyphen - pure-ftpd
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	if you want an admin GUI there's pureadmin
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	bloodnik	thoreauputic	I want one that I can manage without a gui
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	well , you don't need a gui for pure-ftpd
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	and it's very simple
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	it uses existing accounts IIRC and of course you can add accounts
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	it just runs on installation
2005-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	try from another machine on the LAN
2005-10-19T08:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	hmm - worked OK here :(
2005-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	bloodnik	thoreauputic	if I run pure-ftpd I can connect, but I want it to run as a service at startup
2005-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	bloodnik	thoreauputic	never mind
2005-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	it does
2005-10-19T08:38:00.000Z	bloodnik	thoreauputic	sorry ... i do sudo /etc/init.d/pure-ftpd restart and a) nothing happens and b) I still can't connect
2005-10-19T08:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	all I can suggest is that you read the man page - it worked out of the box here
2005-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	I assume you don't have some funky firewalling rules or similar?
2005-10-19T08:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	hmmm ....
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	bloodnik	thoreauputic	I've had to do "sudo pure-ftpd -B" to run it as a daemon.
2005-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	bloodnik	sounds like you woked itt out anyway - I don't recall having to do anything: the install script seems to have started it for me
