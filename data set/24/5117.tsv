2010-02-14T08:49:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	check the rc.d bootup scripts
2010-02-14T08:51:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	where do I find it?
2010-02-14T08:51:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	cd /etc/rc....
2010-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- I have rc0.d rc1.d up to rc6.d -- but no rc.d
2010-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	they are the ones
2010-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- why so many
2010-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	for different runlevels
2010-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- which runlevel am i running at default now then?
2010-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	karmic?
2010-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- yes
2010-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- entering the command runlevel returns unknown
2010-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	install a program called sysvinit-rc or something like that
2010-02-14T08:59:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- there is a sysvinit-utils ? is that the one.. and what does it do
2010-02-14T09:00:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	that is it... it lets you set the bootup scripts manually without messing up the folders of symlinks contained in rc1.d .... 6.d
2010-02-14T09:01:00.000Z	maxflax	damo22	- how do I run it?
2010-02-14T09:01:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	possibly dont change anything, just run it and see what it looks like
2010-02-14T09:02:00.000Z	damo22	maxflax	sudo sysvinit<TAB> enter
