2007-09-20T11:38:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	Oct 19
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	too bad. i can't wait to see what they have added
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	you can download a live cd
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	or install something in a VM
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	but then it would be really slow, and vm doesn't work.
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	which VM are you using?
2007-09-20T11:39:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	i might just get foresightlinux, it has gnome 2.20
2007-09-20T11:40:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	vmware-player
2007-09-20T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	try VirtualBox, virtualbox.org
2007-09-20T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	how much RAM do you have?
2007-09-20T11:40:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	512
2007-09-20T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	should be enough if you don't have much else open
2007-09-20T11:41:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	alright, i'll just get foresight linux because i wanna see something new anyways. I wanna try out a few distros. i haven't really settled on linux
2007-09-20T11:41:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	the only reason i have it right now is because it has good wireless support
2007-09-20T11:44:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	should i try out kde? i don't really like the clock too much, but it seems like it might run faster
2007-09-20T11:44:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	sure, try it if you want..
2007-09-20T11:46:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	whats the difference between gnome and kde?
2007-09-20T11:46:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	they're 2 different environments
2007-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	sh3l1	cyphase	i know that i just don't know what's different about them
2007-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	a lot :)
2007-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	all the basic are the same..
2007-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	windows, buttons, menus, etc
2007-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	cyphase	sh3l1	good idea
