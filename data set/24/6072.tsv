2006-01-27T08:00:00.000Z	trackilizer		I really need your help guys, for some strange reason the X server won't start, i'm in bitchx right now.
2006-01-27T08:00:00.000Z	trackilizer		What is it i should do?
2006-01-27T08:00:00.000Z	trackilizer		I just got this blue box saying something about X won't being able to start.
2006-01-27T08:01:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	what were you doing just prior to it happening?
2006-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	that would be likely :)
2006-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	what did you do?
2006-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	its pretty easy via the command line
2006-01-27T08:03:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	what is your backup file called?
2006-01-27T08:04:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	ok..so in terminal... do   ..  sudo cp ~/Desktop/XORG.txt /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-01-27T08:05:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	ctrl + alt + f2  or f3 or f4
2006-01-27T08:06:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	then you can try doing a sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-01-27T08:06:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	or even startx I suppose
2006-01-27T08:08:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-01-27T08:09:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	or even sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-01-27T08:09:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	ok..I would do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg then
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	trackilizer	mustard5	i get an error saying xeserver-xorg is not installd
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	what?
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	thats pretty strange :)
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	I would say you spelt it wrong
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	sudo dpk-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-01-27T08:15:00.000Z	trackilizer	mustard5	"dpk-reconfigure, command not found"
2006-01-27T08:15:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  ..sorry my spelling error now :)
2006-01-27T08:19:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	all going now?
2006-01-27T08:19:00.000Z	mustard5	trackilizer	lucky you know how to use BitchX ;)
