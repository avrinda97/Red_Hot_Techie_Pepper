2009-01-05T23:10:00.000Z	marco		I reckon ubuntu talks softly to usb devices convincing them to mount like magic?
2009-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	what is the problem you are having with your removable device?
2009-01-05T23:12:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	I'm a curious type. I wanted to configure whatever is automagically mounting usb devices to try to configure the default permissions for vfat devices
2009-01-05T23:12:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	this is linux after all, should be easy to custom simple file permissions, isn't it?
2009-01-05T23:14:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	how curious are you? there are graphical ways to control automounts
2009-01-05T23:14:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	including default permissions? I'm quite curious actually ;-)
2009-01-05T23:24:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	do you want to assign permissions to the entire drive?
2009-01-06T00:26:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	yes.
2009-01-06T00:27:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	namely devices that don't have file permissions understandable by linux (eg. FAT32)
2009-01-06T00:27:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	So that normal users can read what's on the thumb drives, but can't write to it
2009-01-06T00:29:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	you should be able to change /etc/fstab to make the device write-able
2009-01-06T00:30:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	right, but then every new device would get a random "/dev/sd?" file for it
2009-01-06T00:31:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	it's kludgy to use the fstab, there should be a daemon doing the automounting, don't you think?
2009-01-06T00:31:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	and it should have some kind of documentation, but it seems something so simple is so hard to find
2009-01-06T00:32:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	true, i get what you're after now, but i'm not aware of how to do that
2009-01-06T00:33:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	thanks. Any idea where I can find decent documentation on the subject?
2009-01-06T00:42:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	i don't know where to look.  there is a program in the repos called Mount Manager, but I haven't done anything with it (sounds like a graphical tool for /etc/fstab)
2009-01-06T00:44:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	thanks for finding this. How it auto mounts USB devices continues a mistery though, eh?
2009-01-06T00:45:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	as far as i can tell, yes
2009-01-06T00:46:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	oh well, bugger. Thank you so much for spending time on my question. It was really appreciated.
2009-01-06T00:46:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	good luck
2009-01-06T00:53:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	In case you are still interested, it seems that "gnome-volume-manager" handles the auto-mounting of devices on Ubuntu. Why, oh, why rely on a Gnome tool to handle mounting is beyond my ability to comprehend ;-)
2009-01-06T00:54:00.000Z	marco	hot_rod_hippie	it seems to rely on HAL (seems like a kludge to detect changes to the system) to know what to mount
2009-01-06T00:54:00.000Z	hot_rod_hippie	marco	cool, thanks
