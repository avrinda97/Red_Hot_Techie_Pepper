2009-07-16T03:42:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		what's a good place to put installed programs?
2009-07-16T03:42:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		also, what's the difference between /bin and /sbin
2009-07-16T03:43:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	/bin is system binaries.  /sbin is binaries that can only be run as root.
2009-07-16T07:56:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	I know but 5Gb is quite large
2009-07-16T07:57:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	edbian	not if you have 3 or 4 gigs of ram
2009-07-16T07:59:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	I hibernate all the time with my 1GB swap (and 1GB of RAM)
2009-07-16T07:59:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	*Sheepishly* usually nothing :)
2009-07-16T08:01:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	I think that having swap = to ram is a good rule of thumb but I don't think that it is practical to anticipate you might need 10GB of RAM (virtual and physical) at any given point.  Especially with the excellent memory management of linux.  I'm going to give him some aritcles though and let him decide for himself.

2009-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	No.  Totally random.  Affecting different applications and such
2009-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	StrangeCharm	It was on average 1.  Depending how much I used the computer / how long it was on.
