2009-05-09T04:28:00.000Z	offipso		is there a simpler, lighterweight application switcher?
2009-05-09T04:28:00.000Z	offipso		my comp goes slowly when I switch with alt tab
2009-05-09T04:28:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	is it because you have compiz on?
2009-05-09T04:28:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Yeah, but I like some of the other effects
2009-05-09T04:28:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	I also have compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-05-09T04:29:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	you could turn on static application switcher, and customize it so that it does not show snapshots of the program
2009-05-09T04:30:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	or even to not show anything at all
2009-05-09T04:30:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	I am using Static Application Switcher, I've deselected "Icon" and "Mipmap" but it doesn't seem to affect it
2009-05-09T04:30:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	so how's it slowing down?
2009-05-09T04:31:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	When I press Alt-Tab, the delay between when I cycle windows and when the UI updates to indicate what window I'm selecting is very slow
2009-05-09T04:31:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Also, it fades in a very chunky way, to highlight the window that I'm on
2009-05-09T04:33:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	what if you turned compiz off? Your graphics card may not be fast enough to support it.
2009-05-09T04:33:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	and if it is, then it may not have the proper drivers installed.
2009-05-09T04:33:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Well, it does support other effects of compiz fine, such as drop shadows and wobbly windows. I'll try turning it off, but I'd probably switch to XFCE if I can't use it at all
2009-05-09T04:34:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	My card uses the Intel drivers, just an Intel 945GM integrated graphics
2009-05-09T04:34:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-video-intel
2009-05-09T04:35:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Installed: 2:2.6.3-0ubuntu9
2009-05-09T04:35:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep -i intel shows up nothing though
2009-05-09T04:35:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Do I have to explicitly enable it?
2009-05-09T04:35:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	interesting.
2009-05-09T04:35:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	in my experience, no, but hey, for fun, let's try it. Make sure you back up your xorg.conf file.
2009-05-09T04:36:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	driver "intel", I believe the modifier is.
2009-05-09T04:36:00.000Z	offipso	Kareeser	Yea, let me try that. Actually, I'll /msg you directly if that's ok, to avoid the noise of the channel
2009-05-09T04:36:00.000Z	Kareeser	offipso	aye
