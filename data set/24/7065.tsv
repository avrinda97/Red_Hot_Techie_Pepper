2005-05-02T15:09:00.000Z	re|run		I am having difficulty getting my wireless to work right. Everything seemed to be working fine for the first day I had ubuntu running but then yesterday it started dropping the connection and not picking it back up unless I rebooted. Today, it won't work even if I reboot. I have installed a cool little app called wicme to choose waps, but that didn't fix anything. The odd thing is that I can see the access points when I go to configure it, but
2005-05-02T15:09:00.000Z	re|run		I can't connect. It's not a WEP issue b/c it does the same thing with open access points. can someone please give me a couple more ideas? I'm a bit of a newbie but I'm really loving ubuntu!!
2005-05-02T15:11:00.000Z	djones	re|run	My wifi works flawlessly. Perhaps it's a driver issue?
2005-05-02T15:12:00.000Z	djones	re|run	did it get wierd when you installed that client software?
2005-05-02T15:13:00.000Z	djones	re|run	I don't know if it would be helpful, but I use netapplet to manage my network switching.
2005-05-02T15:14:00.000Z	djones	re|run	iwconfig for getting the wifi going
2005-05-02T15:14:00.000Z	djones	re|run	then dhclient
2005-05-02T15:14:00.000Z	djones	re|run	ifconfig is also helpful, as is iwscan
2005-05-02T15:15:00.000Z	djones	re|run	you can man each of those for specifics
2005-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	djones	re|run	ifconfig
2005-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	djones	re|run	do you have an IP?
2005-05-09T09:17:00.000Z	djones	re|run	didn't you just fix this?
2005-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	re|run	djones	no.
2005-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	djones	re|run	nevermind qweqw, he's trolling.
2005-05-09T09:20:00.000Z	djones	re|run	have you tried a different card?
2005-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	djones	re|run	do you have wifi card at your disposal?
2005-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	djones	re|run	I'm wondering if it isn't a driver issue
2005-05-09T09:22:00.000Z	re|run	djones	I had that thought... i couldn't properly set up another card. it just acted really weird.
2005-05-09T09:22:00.000Z	re|run	djones	but I don't really know how to set one up -- lol
2005-05-09T09:23:00.000Z	djones	re|run	are you in linux now?
2005-05-09T09:24:00.000Z	re|run	djones	but it's totally inconsistent
2005-05-09T09:25:00.000Z	djones	re|run	I don't know what I can do to help, but you should join the list-serv, It's really active, and allot of knowlegable people subscribe.
2005-05-09T09:27:00.000Z	re|run	djones	wow. nevermind on the card --- it worked instantly.
2005-05-09T09:27:00.000Z	re|run	djones	yeah, I'll join the list-serv.
