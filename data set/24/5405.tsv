2010-06-19T22:30:00.000Z	rabbit1		wine: how to get the specific program (.exe) file to run in ubuntu 8.04 ?
2010-06-19T22:31:00.000Z	rabbit1		guys, installed wine, can't find any of other programs, except notepad
2010-06-19T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	have you installed a program into Wine yet?
2010-06-19T22:31:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	ok, got to do that then
2010-06-19T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	just click on the .exe and install
2010-06-19T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	what are you trying to install?
2010-06-19T22:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	for which program?
2010-06-19T22:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	That does what?
2010-06-19T22:55:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	without which i won't be able to connect through linux
2010-06-19T22:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	that probably isn't quite true, unless it s AOL or something stupid like that I guess
2010-06-19T22:56:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	its just a authentication client and keeps track of the usage timings
2010-06-19T22:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	you probably don't need it
2010-06-19T22:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	which ISP?
2010-06-19T22:56:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	yes, its stupid here in India, its Sify
2010-06-19T22:57:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	i get the installation screen, and also i can install, but again, don't know where the exe file is located after installation,
2010-06-19T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	applications > wine
2010-06-19T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	well it may have added  shortcuts there
2010-06-19T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	by the way using Wine to connect to an Internet Service Provider, probably won't even work
2010-06-19T22:59:00.000Z	rabbit1	sebsebseb	nothing, its just the same notepad, when i first installed wine
2010-06-19T23:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	really you need the Internet connection working with the OS that is properly installed to the hard disk, so yeah Ubuntu
2010-06-19T23:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	and as long as your Internet Service Provider isn't really stupid, this shoudn't be a problem
2010-06-19T23:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	or you should be able to phone them up at least, and they can tell you details to connect or something
2010-06-19T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rabbit1	what kind of Intenret you got?  the provider, but also the type, like broadband, dial up?
