2009-10-16T00:00:00.000Z	daevski		Where can I get help with an application I can't get to launch/install? (Aptana 1.5)
2009-10-16T00:01:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	try asking in here, exactly what is the problem?
2009-10-16T00:01:00.000Z	daevski		Deathfox -- side by side install with the live disc
2009-10-16T00:01:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- I downloaded the Standalone for linux from the website, but it is an exe and wine doesn't launch it for some reason
2009-10-16T00:02:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- I'm wondering if the file download is wrong... and why it won't do anything when I try to launch the exe with wine. (two seperate issues, but one solution would be fine)
2009-10-16T00:02:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	get an unix compatible app alternative! :) but if u must have that app.. well check if wine is working at all
2009-10-16T00:03:00.000Z	c3l		and are you sure that the program will work in wine? but first of all make sure wine works as intended
2009-10-16T00:03:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- Aptana is the opensource alternative to dreamweaver, but it's downloaded as a exe for some odd reason -- wine is working for other apps, currently.
2009-10-16T00:04:00.000Z	daevski		deathfox -- yes it over writes the boot loader -- but you can get windows to reclaim it if you want to later.
2009-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	daevski		deathfox -- windows can re-create the bootloader with a windows vista disc.
2009-10-16T00:05:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	get the unix version, I just downloaded it and its not an exe
2009-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- ah! thank you... I didn't even think to check for a unix standalone.
2009-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	and check if there is a already working binary package for ubuntu in some repo
2009-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	hehe yw
2009-10-16T00:06:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- I checked repos ... not on any for some reason :-\
2009-10-16T00:07:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	thats really wierd, you should contact the package responsible ppl
2009-10-16T00:08:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- also a good idea. thanks.
2009-10-16T00:08:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	if its open source and free it should be in the repo imo..
2009-10-16T00:09:00.000Z	daevski		:) ok
2009-10-16T00:10:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	for all I know aptana is in the archlinux user repository, not sure if its compatible with ubuntu (im an arch user mostly)
2009-10-16T00:11:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- okay.
2009-10-16T00:11:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	and have you checked the universe repo?
2009-10-16T00:12:00.000Z	daevski	c3l	-- as far as I know I have universe enabled all the time. I can double check though.
2009-10-16T00:13:00.000Z	c3l	daevski	oh, I wasnt sure if its commonly used or not
