2009-04-30T01:35:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers.
2009-04-30T01:35:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Install the recommended driver.
2009-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	i have "nvidia accelerated graphics driver (version 180)" selected already, i guess i figured it would fair better
2009-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Yeah, that's the one i use aswell.
2009-04-30T01:37:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Is it activated?
2009-04-30T01:37:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	says "this driver is activated and currently in use"
2009-04-30T01:38:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	To activate effects, go... System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects > Extra
2009-04-30T01:38:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	yeah the reason i'm doing this is because the effects were causing my screen to go black when i maximized certain windows
2009-04-30T01:39:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Can you be more specific?
2009-04-30T01:40:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	umm, well like sometimes when i maximize FF the screen goes black, it's happened to me on X-Chat, when i resize or maximize video files to a certain size they close instantly, that's pretty much what i've noticed, it goes away (not sure for how long) when i turn down effects but i'd think a 6600 GT would be able to handle what's going on, i guess not
2009-04-30T01:41:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Is your resolution to high? or something.
2009-04-30T01:42:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	it's pretty high, i have two 22" lcds right now (probably should see if there's drivers for them as well)
2009-04-30T01:44:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	yeah right now they are both at 1680x1050 so that's probably something to do with it i guesS?
2009-04-30T01:45:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Yeah could be due to resolution.
2009-04-30T01:45:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Try a lower one?
2009-04-30T01:46:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Have you googled your specific issue? There could be a fix/
2009-04-30T01:46:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	well the black screen i think is because of the effects (e.g. running out of video ram)
2009-04-30T01:46:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	i am also having the problem that when i change some settings in x-server, they aren't being saved
2009-04-30T01:47:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Using root?
2009-04-30T01:47:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	e.g. when i change my monitors so that when i move the mouse it goes between screens.... after i restart it goes back to default and the mouse has to go out the far side to get to the other monitor
2009-04-30T01:48:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	using x-server the app under my account, not sure if it's different from the root user as i'm kinda new to this all
2009-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	System > Preferences > startup I think?
2009-04-30T02:11:00.000Z	coleys	PassePartouT	Grats Passe!! :)
2009-04-30T02:11:00.000Z	PassePartouT	coleys	:) haha yeah it sure is nice
