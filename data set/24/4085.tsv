2007-07-27T13:54:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	i have an idea, hold on
2007-07-27T13:57:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	still workin...
2007-07-27T13:58:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	you still there?
2007-07-27T13:59:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	download this and install it instead : http://ftp.freepark.org/pub/CDROM-Images/ubuntu/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso
2007-07-27T14:00:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	that is the alternate install, i have had much more success with those than anything...
2007-07-27T14:00:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	it is a lot faster too...
2007-07-27T14:00:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	it usually will not hang up as often as regular install...
2007-07-27T14:00:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	what are you system specs?
2007-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	RAM?
2007-07-27T14:04:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	yes...make sure you burn it at a slow speed....
2007-07-27T14:05:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	good luck.
2007-07-27T14:05:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	whenever i install a distro i look for the alternate install cd......it works the best for me...
2007-07-27T14:06:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	get back?
2007-07-27T14:07:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	yes, you could use your ubuntu livecd
2007-07-27T14:07:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	but i suggest you do a clean wipe (erase all hard drive) using the ubuntu alternate cd
2007-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	i doubt you will have any problems after that...just keep all the default settings.....
2007-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	np...
2007-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	frost0	Bill	bye.
