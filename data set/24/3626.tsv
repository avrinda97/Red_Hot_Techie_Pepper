2007-12-03T01:44:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	what exactly do you need to know about grub?
2007-12-03T01:47:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	read the link i sent
2007-12-03T01:47:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	thanks
2007-12-03T01:49:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	what is your intended use for ubuntu?
2007-12-03T01:49:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	intended use? general home use, i guess
2007-12-03T01:49:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	ok reading the article be right back
2007-12-03T01:54:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	May i suggest you just re-install ubuntu to the disk/partition you have already installed to and choose to install grub to the MBR...if you later install windows to disk you can repair the mbr with running a windows boot disk then running   fixmbr \Device\HardDisk0  or whatever disk is your first hard drive
2007-12-03T01:56:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	grub should detect your the installations of windows which alrady exist and add them to the gtub menu
2007-12-03T01:56:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	i have reinstalled ubuntu and installed grub to the mbr
2007-12-03T01:56:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	it doesn't detect windows on other hard drives
2007-12-03T01:59:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	well it isn't and that's not going to change. i should be able to manually add windows, sholdn't i?
2007-12-03T02:01:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	fix your mbr as above first, back up your files and reinstall windows before dual booting with ubuntu install grub to mbr save you a lot of pain
2007-12-03T02:05:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	so will fixing the mbr with windows let grub to pick up windows?
2007-12-03T02:07:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	well i mean what i'm trying to do here is get grup to pick up the windows install on the second hard drive
2007-12-03T02:08:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	windows is best to be on your fist drive
2007-12-03T02:10:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	by switching the jumpers?
2007-12-03T02:11:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	yeah switch the jumbers .
2007-12-03T02:12:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	alright thanks. will that mess up my ubuntu install?
2007-12-03T02:12:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	the jumpers on the back of your drives...sorry didnt know if you knew
2007-12-03T02:12:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	yeah
2007-12-03T02:13:00.000Z	digitori	DPic1	only if you reinstall ubuntu but you could keep your home partition
2007-12-03T02:13:00.000Z	DPic1	digitori	okay thanks
