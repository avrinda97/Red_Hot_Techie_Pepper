2005-12-31T12:56:00.000Z	anir		hello friends
2005-12-31T12:56:00.000Z	anir		how are you all doing
2005-12-31T12:57:00.000Z	anir		how can i change the directory from the command prompt??
2005-12-31T12:58:00.000Z	sethk	anir	cd with no arguments.  Alternates include   cd $HOME   and cd ~
2005-12-31T12:58:00.000Z	sethk	anir	there is no command cd/home.
2005-12-31T12:59:00.000Z	sethk	anir	without a space, cd/home is a single command which doesn't exist
2005-12-31T12:59:00.000Z	sethk	anir	plus remember that a unix filename cannot have a forward slash
2005-12-31T12:59:00.000Z	sethk	anir	and in real computers the switch flag is -, not /
2005-12-31T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	anir	you ran something (which you didn't tell us) which in turn tried to run a process called realplay, but did not find the program realplay in the search path
2005-12-31T13:01:00.000Z	anir	sethk	i have installed realplayer..
2005-12-31T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	anir	I didn't say you haven't.  I said that it attempted to execute "realplay" and did not find it.
2005-12-31T13:02:00.000Z	anir	sethk	.:) ye si have i have made some mistake whjile installing.. let me try again.. i am amature..lol
2005-12-31T13:04:00.000Z	anir	sethk	i have followed the steps as given .. but why is the error message.. how can i rectify?
2005-12-31T13:04:00.000Z	sethk	anir	my first guess is that it was installed in /usr/local/bin, and /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH
2005-12-31T13:04:00.000Z	sethk	anir	do    "type realplayer"  (I think it is realplayer; whatever the file is called) and see if it is found
2005-12-31T13:05:00.000Z	sethk	anir	if not, try    ls /usr/local/bin/realplayer
2005-12-31T13:05:00.000Z	sethk	anir	do   echo $PATH  to look at your search path
2005-12-31T13:07:00.000Z	anir	sethk	while specifying the path while installing do i have to use "[ ] "
2005-12-31T13:07:00.000Z	sethk	anir	no
2005-12-31T13:07:00.000Z	anir	sethk	i have installed in /usr/bin/RealPlayer
2005-12-31T13:08:00.000Z	sethk	anir	then either you mistyped the error message, or you ran realplay instead of RealPlayer
2005-12-31T13:08:00.000Z	anir	sethk	i am trying to open it from appliction>sound & video> realplayer
2005-12-31T13:09:00.000Z	sethk	anir	then right click on that menu, select properties, and see where it is trying to find it
2005-12-31T13:10:00.000Z	anir	sethk	while right clicking .. no properties..:(
