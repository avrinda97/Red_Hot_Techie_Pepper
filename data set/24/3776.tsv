2007-10-24T03:37:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	possible answer: b/c your acpi is droken
2007-10-24T03:37:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	what is the "acpi"?
2007-10-24T03:59:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	acpi doesn't work properly. it can be dangerous to your hardware to let it run over a longer period of time like that
2007-10-24T03:59:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	- good to know. what can i do about that?
2007-10-24T04:00:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	what kernel on what hardware?
2007-10-24T04:01:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	intel core duo 2. whatever kernel gutsy comes with
2007-10-24T04:01:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	so try feity
2007-10-24T04:01:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	really? that's the only solution?
2007-10-24T04:02:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	i've been waiting for gutsy to make the switch from windows to ubuntu
2007-10-24T04:02:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	the only solution taht doesn't involve serious hacking beyond your learning curve atm
2007-10-24T04:03:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	that makes me sad. :( ... but it seems necessary at this point. you're right. feisty never did this for me....
2007-10-24T04:03:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	is there a way in the command line to check my processor temperature?
2007-10-24T04:03:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	acpi -V
2007-10-24T04:05:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	that's not dangerous, but too high IMHO
2007-10-24T04:05:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	yeah. it feels hot to the touch compared to windows. sigh. i really don't want to switch to feisty. would a kernel recompile in gutsy be any help?
2007-10-24T04:07:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	yes, i run a vanilla 2.6.23.1 and it's much better. But given the relatively low number of killer features in gutsy (zero?) running feisty with a well tested gnome might just be less work and more fun
2007-10-24T04:07:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	also, would using the 64 bit version possibly solve my problem? or no?
2007-10-24T04:08:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	by vanilla, you mean generic? would i have to do a manual recompile to get a generic kernel? ... not sure what you mean by "well tested gnome". isn't there only one?
2007-10-24T04:08:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	no,i don't think that 64bit would make it better... it's a kernel-source/configuration probelm afaicsproble
2007-10-24T04:09:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	by vanilla i mean taking the source from kernel.org, not from ubuntu
2007-10-24T04:10:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	ah. okay. well. i guess i'll go install fiesty now. i loved how seemless things become. i need to shut down my computer. my fans been running overtime for too long
2007-10-24T04:12:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	stefg	wouuld it be more work than it's worth to try to compile something from kernel.org to work with gutsy?
2007-10-24T04:14:00.000Z	stefg	eyeRmonkey	configuring a working kernel for your hardware takes some knowledge and experience. The easy way is installing feisty. the dirty, but rewarding way is to learn hoe to build a kernel. Don't expect success at first try
