2006-01-13T17:29:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	/etc/environment or /etc/profile or ~/.bashrs, export VAR=value
2006-01-13T17:30:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	 did you meand bashrc??
2006-01-13T17:30:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	though you'd leave out export in /etc/environment
2006-01-13T17:30:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	no ~/.bashrc
2006-01-13T17:30:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	it means /home/<user>/.bashrc
2006-01-13T17:31:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	 yeah but you said bashrs so I was confused
2006-01-13T17:31:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	really? well that was a typo then, sorry
2006-01-13T17:33:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	I checked etc/environment and etc/profile ... these dirs don't exist -- is this okay?
2006-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	export PATH="$PATH":/some/additional/path
2006-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	I do have a .bashrc though
2006-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	you wanna do this just for your user or systemwide?
2006-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	 I can't edit the bashrc to do the same?
2006-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	 what's the diff between sys-wide and just me_user
2006-01-13T17:35:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	the difference is if you login as a different user it wont have any effect if it's only done for you
2006-01-13T17:35:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	 when I export PATH="$blahblah  does it overwrite or append?
2006-01-13T17:35:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	overwrites
2006-01-13T17:36:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	export PATH="$PATH":/extra/path
2006-01-13T17:36:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	how do I add a path to $PATH if it overwrites what was there?
2006-01-13T17:36:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	export PATH="$PATH":/extra/path
2006-01-13T17:36:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	note the PATH="$PATH" it prepends the existing path
2006-01-13T17:37:00.000Z	woodgrain	mwe	don't understand thought you said it overwrites?
2006-01-13T17:37:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	note the PATH="$PATH" it prepends the existing path
2006-01-13T17:37:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	like I said
2006-01-13T17:38:00.000Z	mwe	woodgrain	PATH=/some/path overwrites. PATH="$PATH":/some/path prepends the old path
