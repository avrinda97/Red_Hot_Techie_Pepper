2005-04-09T15:07:00.000Z	Ratmann		lol
2005-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	Ratmann		hehehe
2005-04-09T15:08:00.000Z	Ratmann		That's the only thing that bothers me about linux, i don't know about installing stuff in it
2005-04-09T15:09:00.000Z	Ratmann		Oh
2005-04-09T15:09:00.000Z	Ratmann		Yeah
2005-04-09T15:10:00.000Z	Ratmann		Right now i wanna see if i can install Wings 3d, a free 3d modelling application
2005-04-09T15:10:00.000Z	Ratmann		Got the Linux version
2005-04-09T15:10:00.000Z	Ratmann		wings-0.98.29b-linux.run.gz , that's the name of the file
2005-04-09T15:10:00.000Z	Ratmann		Yah it's nice
2005-04-09T15:11:00.000Z	Ratmann		Though after that, i'm gonna try and get Softimage XSI , which is the main 3d animation aplication i use
2005-04-09T15:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	wings3d is already in the repos
2005-04-09T15:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	debian-based distros like Ubuntu use centralized software repositories for installing and updating
2005-04-09T15:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	so generally everything you need is in those repos
2005-04-09T15:40:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	did you install wings from the repos?
2005-04-09T15:41:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	it is in the repos
2005-04-09T15:41:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	the other advantage repos provide is removal scripts
2005-04-09T15:42:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	you connect to them through synaptic or apt-get or aptitude
2005-04-09T15:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	run synaptic if you want to have a gui tool
2005-04-09T15:49:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	the great thing about linux is that you won't need to reboot unless there is a kernel update
2005-04-09T15:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	synaptic settings---> repos   add--> hoary --> click all four checkboxes
2005-04-10T16:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	sure
2005-04-10T16:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	the only thing I see there is it uses Xfree86 and hoary uses xorg
2005-04-10T16:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	it may work, but it may not
2005-04-10T16:53:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Ratmann	I don't see any major gotcha-yas, but be aware it doesn't seem to be supported on debian platforms (like ubuntu)
