2009-10-27T12:52:00.000Z	DJones	vtec_	That should leave you with a basic gnome desktop
2009-10-27T12:52:00.000Z	vtec_		!puregnome
2009-10-27T12:52:00.000Z	vtec_		oh
2009-10-27T12:52:00.000Z	vtec_		sudo apt-get remove kdelibs4c2 kdelibs5-data && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-10-27T12:52:00.000Z	vtec_		So I just type that?
2009-10-27T12:53:00.000Z	DJones	vtec_	Its not something I've done myself, but thats how I read ubottu's message
2009-10-27T12:53:00.000Z	vtec_	DJones	will that remove all my desktop settings I have at the moment?
2009-10-27T12:54:00.000Z	DJones	vtec_	I'm not sure about that, I'm sure somebody else in the channel will know the answer though, it might just take a bit of time for somebody who knows to come into the channel
2009-10-27T12:54:00.000Z	vtec_		alright DJones I appreciate it mate
2009-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	vtec_		Guess there is only one way to find out
2009-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	DJones	vtec_	No prob's, i wish i could help more, i've just not tried that myself, so don't want to say it'll do exactly what you want without being certain
2009-10-27T12:56:00.000Z	vtec_	DJones	looking at the terminal it is removing everything I needed removed
2009-10-27T12:56:00.000Z	vtec_		now I don't know what's going to happen with the ubuntu-desktop command
2009-10-27T12:57:00.000Z	vtec_		The following NEW packages will be installed:
2009-10-27T12:57:00.000Z	vtec_		  gnome-orca libgnome-speech7 ubuntu-desktop
2009-10-27T12:57:00.000Z	vtec_		Shall I say no and leave it as it is?
2009-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	vtec_	DJones	The command worked great and removed everything, nothing changed in my Ubuntu Desktop, all went well.
2009-10-27T13:01:00.000Z	vtec_		Quick question, what is the difference bewteen Add/Remove and Synaptic?
2009-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	vtec_		What is a linux shell? Basically a command?
2009-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	vtec_		Ahhh I see
