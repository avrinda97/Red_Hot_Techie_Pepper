2009-01-19T10:56:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	dpkg -l | grep ubuntu-desktop
2009-01-19T10:59:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	entered that ( as all 1 command?) no messages error or otherwise
2009-01-19T10:59:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	that means you don't have it installed.  you have a base system but no GUI installed currently.   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop     and wait while it downloads a bunch of stuff
2009-01-19T11:00:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	hrm or maybe it'll install it off the CD i dunno
2009-01-19T11:03:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	thinking it wa two seperate commands I entered "dpkg -l" and got a list starting with " ubunti-minimal 1.102" and ending with "zlibig 1:1.2.3.3.dfsg compression library - runtime" and a lot of other descriptions of stuff in between
2009-01-19T11:04:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	ah!  so what do you see when you do    dpkg -l | grep ubuntu-desktop    as one command?
2009-01-19T11:05:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	nothing just a blinking cursor...
2009-01-19T11:06:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	that's a proper result if you don't have ubuntu-desktop installed.  which means that you haven't got the GUI packages.
2009-01-19T11:07:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	man how is that possible when I did the install off the (alt) CD and at boot up it gave me a choice of which OS to chose, Ubuntu being one of them...?
2009-01-19T11:08:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	the gui is an extra component to the linux system  it's not necessary for a fully functioning system
2009-01-19T11:08:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	so you can boot the computer and run the command line programs
2009-01-19T11:08:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	but   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop  should get all the normal GUI stuff installed for you.
2009-01-19T11:09:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	chalk up a big DUH for marabout. ok let me try that
2009-01-19T11:11:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	 after typing : "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-deskttop"  command is repeated and then just a blinking cursor
2009-01-19T11:12:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	that's weird.  what does your prompt look like?
2009-01-19T11:13:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	 before now it was "~$ " now it is just " _ "  blinking
2009-01-19T11:13:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	hit control-c a couple of times until you get back to ~$
2009-01-19T11:14:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	thanks reverted back
2009-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	so should i just insert the disc again and start over or is their an "easier" way?
2009-01-19T11:16:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	from the $ prompt, try   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-01-19T11:22:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	did you try    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   again?
2009-01-19T11:23:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	 just a sec will do,  but last time resulted in blinking cursor...
2009-01-19T11:23:00.000Z	wastrel	marabout	make sure you're starting at a $  prompt.
2009-01-19T11:25:00.000Z	marabout	wastrel	"couldnt find package ubuntu-desktop"
