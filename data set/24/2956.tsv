2008-06-10T23:07:00.000Z	Nickey		Guys, why my ubuntu is slower than windows xp, anyone?
2008-06-10T23:08:00.000Z	Nickey		Even when opening documents or e.g. terminal it shows me an hourglass, winxp is much faster, is there anything I can do about it?
2008-06-10T23:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	How much ram do you have
2008-06-10T23:09:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	2GB
2008-06-10T23:10:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	maybe I have to uninstall KDE and use xfce?
2008-06-10T23:10:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	Gnome was the same
2008-06-10T23:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	It shouldnt be noticibly slower by any means.. I would look closely about things you added after the initial install
2008-06-10T23:12:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	I added nothing...no I addded wine latest only that's it, but no windows applications yet. Please help me find a complete tweaking guide for ubuntu, so I'll turn off everything i don't meed
2008-06-10T23:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	Try it before installing the latest wine..
2008-06-10T23:15:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	I remember it was the same, it's not about wine
2008-06-10T23:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	Not saying it is about wine, but about adding wine to your system
2008-06-10T23:16:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	...it was the same...
2008-06-10T23:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	It isnt for the rest of us..
2008-06-10T23:17:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	what do you mean?
2008-06-10T23:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	for me and most users XP is lower than ubuntu
2008-06-10T23:19:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	How can that be? :(
2008-06-10T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	I am not here to debate...  it is a fact of life for most users.. SOme have odd hardware that isnt supported that is slowing things down  but in general it is faster
2008-06-10T23:20:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	what are the minimal specs for ubuntu?
2008-06-10T23:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	512 ram is the sweet spot lower than that you will take a performance hit.
2008-06-10T23:21:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	I have 2GB.... :( Isn't ubuntu tweakable? There must be things I don't need in it.
2008-06-10T23:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	you can always compile your own kernel, but most users end up with something slower than generic setupo
2008-06-10T23:23:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	I meant some other tweak with settings, services I could disable...
2008-06-10T23:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nickey	there are some tweeks I have seen online.. but nothing I want to bother with
2008-06-10T23:34:00.000Z	Nickey	Jack_Sparrow	do you think this guide is of any use? - http://www.linuxmonitor.net/blog/2007/03/ultimate-ubuntu-performance-tweaking.html
