2010-09-07T02:35:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	what i'm trying to get at is that hp printers worked smoothly some versions back, now it's areal pain getting them work under Ubuntu
2010-09-07T02:35:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I like the big Gestetners as well. Very robust.
2010-09-07T02:36:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	their firmware isnt "free" to use and include in distributions.
2010-09-07T02:36:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	That will also mean its not free to modify so that users will like the printers they bought :(
2010-09-07T02:37:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	i've never heard of this manufacturer before
2010-09-07T02:37:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	Ricoh ?
2010-09-07T02:37:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	yes, i've heard about that
2010-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	They joined forced with Gestetner. Utmost good printers.
2010-09-07T02:39:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I used to buy alot of HP printers, but now ive lost all interrest in them.
2010-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I have no relation to any printer manufacturer or so if you wonder.
2010-09-07T02:41:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	but you're saying that these makes are no-no for linux?
2010-09-07T02:42:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	Atleats the 100X series where crap. Requires software loaded into ram that is non-free to the customer who bought HP-Printers.
2010-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	i see
2010-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I bought some HP 1005 printers and they utilized that crap.
2010-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I always liked HP but now i feel theyve done bad.
2010-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	i have similar feelings
2010-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	Ill think about emailing them about lost sales but yould think theyd know better then not pleasing their buystaff/admins/users etc.
2010-09-07T02:46:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	hmm, not worth your time i guess
2010-09-07T02:46:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	It wouldnt surprise me if we dont have 10000 of their older printers and a few hundred Gestetners.
2010-09-07T02:47:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	I think it would change things.
2010-09-07T02:47:00.000Z	rblst	Hopsa	where do you work?
2010-09-07T02:48:00.000Z	Hopsa	rblst	But what i can also tell you is that i have many friends that doesnt like their new unfree-must-have-to-use-their-printers-software
