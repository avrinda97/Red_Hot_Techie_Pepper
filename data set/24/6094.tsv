2006-03-21T17:06:00.000Z	majd		hey, i'm following the http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=916 tutorial and i'm trying to install compiz (through synaptic) now as it was applying the changes, it gave me a message when it was "preparing for removal of linux-image-2.6.12-10-386" and it's asking me if i'm sure....am i?
2006-03-21T17:08:00.000Z	majd		ummm...i pressed something when i was copying the message it gave me and it just got done applying the changes...it left me "E: linux-image-2.6.12-10-386: subprocess pre-removal script killed by signal (Interrupt)

2006-03-21T17:08:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	the only time I ever saw that was when I hit ctl-c during an update
2006-04-09T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	you might like vim-gtk
2006-04-09T10:50:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	isn't it ridiculously hard to learn?
2006-04-09T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	no, the vim-gtk has a gui, with menus for just about everything
2006-04-09T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	I use that for anything more than simple editing
2006-04-09T10:52:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	how would i launch it? vim just launches the terminal onie
2006-04-09T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	gvim , and it should be under the accessories menu
2006-05-01T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	sudo umount /dev/hda1 , then run that mount command again
2006-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	you can look for icons in a package by using the dpkg tool: dpkg -L azureus | grep png (that looks at all the files in the azureus package, and searches for the png files)
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	http://www.robolink.com/calculators10.htm is a decent tool
2006-06-26T14:39:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	I use that fairly often, I am no sys admin ;)
2008-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	that's normal, it is just making a backup and telling you about it
2008-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	but then it doesn't do anything
2008-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	try full path names
2008-01-22T08:51:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	full path name for what?
2008-01-22T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	the command and the config file , like /usr/local/bin/lighthttp (although I wonder why you're not using the ubuntu provided ones)
2008-01-22T08:53:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	well when i try to change screen resolutions, it doesn't give me an option for 1024x768
2008-01-22T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	what does a web server have to do with screen res?
2008-01-22T08:53:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	a web server?
2008-01-22T08:53:00.000Z	nickrud	majd	sorry, I lost the nick I was talking to
2008-01-22T08:54:00.000Z	majd	nickrud	oh heh it's ok
