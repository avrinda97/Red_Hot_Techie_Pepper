2011-01-09T18:31:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	what does your mount / fstab line read?
2011-01-09T18:11:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	dd?
2011-01-09T18:12:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	Can I DD an sr device?
2011-01-09T18:12:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	sorry, "sr"?
2011-01-09T18:14:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	sr is that it shows up as a SCSI cdrom. I guess. CD-Rom devices are usually read only cuz their loop or whatever
2011-01-09T18:15:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	I dont think you can mount a cdrom device as rw
2011-01-09T18:16:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	how does mount know it's a CD, unless you tell it... I don't think -o loop is the problem.
2011-01-09T18:18:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	I dont know how it knows. It got automounted
2011-01-09T18:19:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	that's my point
2011-01-09T18:30:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	hey the force mount thing fails. We get """mount: block device /dev/sr1 is write-protected, mounting read-only; /dev/sr1 on /media/DTVP type iso9660 (ro)"""
2011-01-09T18:33:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	"""" #/ was on /dev/sda5 during installation """
2011-01-09T18:33:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	not quite the one I need. tell me how you attempted to "force".
2011-01-09T18:34:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	 I didnt attempt to force (as I dont remember the command for that)  so I just su'ed and hope for the best
2011-01-09T18:36:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	Playing god?
2011-01-09T18:38:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	nah Im not that new to su. Plus I've use gentoo for quite a bit which is su only
2011-01-09T18:38:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	besides, what you said doesn't make sense.
2011-01-09T18:38:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	What do you need clarified
2011-01-09T18:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	Clarify "so I just su'ed and hope for the best"
2011-01-09T18:46:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	Oh, I did not remember how to use the --force flag or whichever. So I said hopefully su is enough. Either way didnt work
2011-01-09T18:47:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	by "force" I think umount and specifying a brand new mount command will be different
2011-01-09T18:48:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	Could you clarify that?
2011-01-09T18:49:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	start with umount
2011-01-09T18:51:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	IceCas	mount -o loop is not required, neither are a bunch of other things, fiddle and see what works. if you are wanting to blow away data you don't even need it mounted.
2011-01-09T18:52:00.000Z	IceCas	q_a_z_steve	Yes, that's already been done. The umount. and  The mount -t blahblah -o rw /media/DataTrav . That was the first thing I did
