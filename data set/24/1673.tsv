2010-06-05T06:10:00.000Z	codebrainz		does anyone know how to get the textbox back for the address bar in nautilus, instead of these buttons?
2010-06-05T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	I'd also like to know...
2010-06-05T06:12:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	press Ctrl+L and the breadcrumbs buttons turn into a text box.  woohoo!
2010-06-05T06:13:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	There are a couple other shortcuts
2010-06-05T06:13:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	oh, but it doesn't stay a textbox!?
2010-06-05T06:13:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	It doesn't stay
2010-06-05T06:13:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	I'd love to change the default.  I don't particularly care for the buttons although I do see their advantage
2010-06-05T06:15:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	in thunar file manager in xfce, it's just under the view menu, to toggle views, where it logically makes sense to have it
2010-06-05T06:15:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	Tell me about it!  I love gnome and I hate gnome :P
2010-06-05T08:09:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	it was on mine!?
2010-06-05T08:10:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	it is installed by default, just not running
2010-06-05T08:10:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	i c
2010-06-05T08:11:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	i think he's trying to connect to a vm on his pc.
2010-07-01T07:50:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	have you ever heard of a fstab gui, and if not, any ideas why (it's trivial to write)?
2010-07-01T07:51:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	I've never heard of a project to make a gui for it.  I agree it is trivial to write.  Maybe that's the reason it hasn't been written?  It's not "fun" enough
2010-07-01T07:52:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	i started writing one once (pygtk) but i just gave up because it takes two seconds for me to just edit the fstab file :)
2010-07-01T07:53:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	Ha ha.  I think the file is pretty easy to learn
2010-07-01T07:53:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	i suppose this what gnome gvfs solves, in a roundabout way
2010-07-01T07:54:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	Eh, gvfs does a lousy job often.  Plus fstab lets you specify mount options
2010-07-01T07:54:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	completely agree, as evidenced by the current issue at hand
2010-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	Can you send me your pygtk code?  How far did you get?
2010-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	not sure i have it, but with python, i could prolly whip something up in 10-20 minutes
2010-07-01T07:56:00.000Z	edbian	codebrainz	Hah. I love python too
2010-07-01T07:56:00.000Z	codebrainz	edbian	if you're intersted to build something PM me, I'm always open for hacking on code
