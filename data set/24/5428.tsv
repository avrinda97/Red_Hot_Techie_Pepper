2007-02-16T14:20:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	come on, did this wiki, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows, helps you at all??
2007-02-16T14:22:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	ok. misspell?
2007-02-16T14:22:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	misspell as in ?
2007-02-16T14:23:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	in menu.lst file and what did the error said?
2007-02-16T14:24:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	i can only get into the system through LIVE cd, you want me to do that ?
2007-02-16T14:25:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	oh yeah. that is THE way to fix it. :)
2007-02-16T14:25:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	I did follow the wiki and thats all what I'm saying the grub does not load at startup
2007-02-16T14:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	what's an error message for grub?
2007-02-16T14:26:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	no error message, windows just loads up
2007-02-16T14:28:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	ah. ok. grub is not installed then.
2007-02-16T14:29:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	what should I do ?
2007-02-16T14:32:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	i never done this specific part before, but i have fixed my grub 3x when grub spew out err message. there is section called "Using the Desktop/LiveCD and Overwriting the Windows bootloader" where you need to re-install grub (since it boots straight to Win32)
2007-02-16T14:39:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	i'm running the live cd and apparently grub is installed but it won't appear when I reboot & windows will load automatically, you want me to check any files or something ?
2007-02-16T14:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	hmm. is there any timeout? it might be why?
2007-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	?
2007-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	is there timeout in menu.lst?
2007-02-16T14:45:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	I just restarted the PC to check if grub appears this time, you replied so late
2007-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	no grub, what you want me to do now, load the LIVE CD and see the contents of this file menu.lst ? where is this file located ?
2007-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	yes. i do hope that is the problem. (crossed fingers)
2007-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	tabman	IcemanV9	should I install grub again now & then see the contens of this file or just see it right away after the live cd loads ?
2007-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	just check the content of the file (as you said it is installed)
2007-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	IcemanV9	tabman	did u mount the root to see if grub file are intacted?
