2005-10-07T10:07:00.000Z	crimsun		ipw2200 support in Breezy is excellent.
2005-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	really??
2005-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	 I haven't tried but have been waiting for it to be supported nicely
2005-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	 Does it work well?  Are you using it??
2005-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	Ubuntu (and now Debian) uses linux-image
2005-10-14T10:54:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	ahh
2005-12-07T16:31:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	do you mean WPA?
2005-12-07T16:32:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	you'll have to install the wpasupplicant package
2005-12-07T16:32:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	so not possible with live cd.. :(
2005-12-07T16:32:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	no, because wpasupplicant is a universe package
2005-12-07T16:34:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	because wpasupplicant has only recently begun to be anything close to stable.
2005-12-24T09:34:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	16 is.
2006-03-12T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	you're using ALSA
2006-03-12T13:15:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	how do you know that?  Like how do the sound systems work I have no idea.  It seems like though OSS works better for me?  At least I couldn't get sound in vlc to work until I ranodmly checked a box that said work around buggy oss drivers and then blam perfect sound.  My sound sucked in Doom III then I changed to OSS in the options and bam worked.  What's going on  I have no clue about this stuff
2006-03-12T13:15:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	because Ubuntu uses ALSA by default.
2006-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	it's really all quite simple: OSS and ALSA are both audio APIs. Ubuntu uses ALSA.
2006-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	now what you should have done instead for vlc is install vlc-plugin-alsa, then choose ALSA for the sound output in vlc's preferences
2006-03-12T13:18:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	yeah should have done that, if I had any idea in the freaking world to do that.  Why isn't that  installed then when it is installed from the repos sigh...  I had no freaking idea such a thing existed or would be needed.  I would assume that programs came with what they needed  or some crap.  Or at least have it as a recommended package but I don't recall seeing it there if it was recommended
2006-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	I changed it for Dapper.
2006-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	alright, thank you very much :)
2006-03-12T13:23:00.000Z	lampshade	crimsun	so when my sound was jittery in Doom III, with ALSA, and then I switch it to OSS, why is that?  Is it just that Doom's programmers were more partial to OSS or who is really in control Doom III or Ubuntu, ugh I wish I understood the whole sound system more.   Does everything just run through one file  that represents the audio device and ALSA, OSS, etc are just ways of sharing that file?
2006-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	when you "switched" Doom III to use OSS output, you're still using ALSA's OSS emulation, which generally doesn't have any problems (always exceptions to every rule). It works on more systems, because many manufacturers create shoddy hardware that OSS works around. ALSA's much less forgiving.
2006-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	lampshade	don't think in terms of "files" -- that's the old OSS way. Instead, think in terms of "devices."
