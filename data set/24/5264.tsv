2009-09-24T15:24:00.000Z	adok		guys .. im having a huge problem with my laptop. i was trying to setup afterstep on ubuntu 9.04, and after i get all the packages installed, i run this command echo "export WINDOW_MANAGER=/usr/local/bin/afterstep" > ~/.gnomerc
2009-09-24T15:24:00.000Z	adok		now the laptop crashs everytime i boot
2009-09-24T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	adok	erm, isn't afterstep in the repositories?  Why did you compile it?
2009-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	adok	jrib	http://pastebin.com/m3f5f6c5d
2009-09-24T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	adok	well it shouldn't be in /usr/local/
2009-09-24T15:26:00.000Z	adok	jrib	yes i know, i found that in a guide, and i changed to the right path after look for afterstep with whereis
2009-09-24T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	adok	but that's not what you wrote.  What does your ~/.gnomerc actually say?
2009-09-24T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	adok	what else did you run?
2009-09-24T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	adok	try setting WINDOW_MANAGER to metacity the same way you set it to afterstep
2009-09-24T15:29:00.000Z	adok	jrib	sorry,
2009-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	adok	jrib	no.. this didnt work
2009-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	adok	pastebin your .gnomerc
2009-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	jrib	adok	describe what you mean by "crash" exactly
2009-09-24T15:38:00.000Z	adok	jrib	after it boots, as usual ubuntu loads the graphic login. it refreshs the screen like... 3 times, and laptop crashs, nothing works, no numlock, nothing
2009-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	adok	so you never attempt to login?
2009-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	adok	jrib	and ... i cant see anything only fuzz graphics..
2009-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	adok	jrib	no.. i cant display that screen
2009-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	adok	pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-09-24T15:41:00.000Z	adok	jrib	hmm... im using a PC next to the laptop, will take some time to get the log from there in here
2009-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	adok	jrib	im goin to try mount a usb drive
2009-09-24T15:47:00.000Z	adok	jrib	here is the Xorg.0.log http://pastebin.com/m60bbcd93
2009-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	adok	do you know if the (EE) line in your log is normal for you?
2009-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	adok	jrib	i got no idea, actually, Xorg.0.log looks alot bigger compared to slackware
2009-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	adok	jrib	well, theres got to be something wrong with my xorg.conf. i started Xorg, and it happens the same, it crashes
