2006-10-07T06:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	Why are you trying to uninstall glib?
2006-10-07T06:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	If it has a GUI in Ubuntu it probably needs glib
2006-10-07T06:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	Open synaptic, search for that package, select it, and hit ctrl-e
2006-10-07T06:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	Tell it to use the one that ends with '(dapper)'
2006-10-07T06:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	or dapper-security/dapper-updates if they exist
2006-10-07T06:31:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	worked!!! great!! thanks
2006-10-07T06:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	I've been burned by 3rd party repos one too many times :)
2006-10-07T06:33:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	i learn somthing new today
2006-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	That's always a good thing. :)
2006-10-07T06:34:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	can i ask you one more thing on another topic, will "update-manager -c -d" outcome will the same as installing edgy from scratch?
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	sort of
2006-10-07T06:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	anything it considers a custom configuration change will be kept whether you want it or not
2006-10-07T06:37:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	hmm.. what would you recommend? doing it from scratch or dealing with each configuration? will the repos will change accordingly?
2006-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	it'll change the repos and attempt an upgrade
2006-10-07T06:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	at this point in edgy development it should upgrade alright
2006-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	upgrading is slower and more likely to have weirdness but you get to keep all your installed apps and settings
2006-10-07T06:44:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	ho man, i thought i was done.. forcing the right version means removing ALOT of other packages for some.. i need to force libpango to the right version, and it basicly wants to remove all my apps
2006-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	oy
2006-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	you need to manually download pango and gtk from the repos and use dpkg to install them
2006-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	hmm how do i do that?
2006-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	look somewhere in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool
2006-10-07T06:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	amit	probably under g and p
2006-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	god.. too much work.. i think i will do a clean install...
2006-10-07T06:52:00.000Z	amit	Amaranth	never the less, you helped me alot today, thanks friend
