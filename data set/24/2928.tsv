2008-06-23T05:41:00.000Z	mynetdude		I know this isn't an ubuntu question... but it involves ubuntu... I'm trying to use google picasa from ubuntu all my pics are on a USB drive attached to my networked windows box which is also shared and I read awhile back that picasa can read from networked drives, a share is not necessarily a network drive correct?
2008-06-23T05:41:00.000Z	mynetdude		if I understand correctly... I would have to map that network share/drive?
2008-06-23T05:42:00.000Z	mynetdude		to do that how would I do that in ubuntu?
2008-06-23T05:42:00.000Z	mynetdude		better yet, the real question is, how do I map a network drive?
2008-06-23T05:42:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	hold on
2008-06-23T05:43:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	cool ty, take ur time

2008-06-23T05:47:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	well picasa won't looka t network shares... so it has to be a drive letter
2008-06-23T05:47:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	I'd like to try the GUI way of doing it anyway, I'm anti CLI
2008-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	You're not going to be able to map a network "drive", as Linux doesn't have a concept of such things.
2008-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	is there any info on doing this the GUI way?
2008-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	oh
2008-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	I know windows does... but I also noticed that picasa doesn't see C:\filesystem as you said it doesn't have the concept of drive letters
2008-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	It's been ages since I've used Ubuntu's GNOME interface, but it's one of the options in the center menu.  I think it's called "Connect to remote computer" or such.
2008-06-23T05:49:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	I just need to mount a network drive... drive letters are irrelevant as picasa won't look at network shares
2008-06-23T05:49:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	The GUI way of doing it is only going to appear in Nautilus, IIRC.  But I could be wrong.
2008-06-23T05:50:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	I guess we'll find out, I think thats what we want... whatever nautilus sees so will picasa
2008-06-23T05:50:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	The "Connect to remote computer" allows you to set up a virtual folder that lets you access the files on an FTP server, SSH server or Windows computer.
2008-06-23T05:50:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	It's a catch-all for remote filesystems.
2008-06-23T05:51:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	I don't understand though... when I log into the windows share, the volume is automatically mounted on the desktop... isn't that enough?
2008-06-23T05:52:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	Picasa is based on WINE, which is based off of the fundamental Linux filesystem.  IIRC, "Connect to Server" creates a virtual filesystem which is only visible within GNOME.
2008-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	mynetdude	shortc|laptop	would it be "connect to server"?
2008-06-23T05:53:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	So, yes.
2008-06-23T05:54:00.000Z	shortc|laptop	mynetdude	It uses winelib, which is basically a library that lets you compile Windows applications on Linux.
