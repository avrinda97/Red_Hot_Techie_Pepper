2005-12-11T13:17:00.000Z	frogzoo		ie at the top of the script 'export Display=0.0'     iirc ?
2005-12-11T13:18:00.000Z	frogzoo		like so 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' no comments
2005-12-11T13:20:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	/ Overclocked_486 : What are you doing?
2005-12-11T13:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	Overclocked_486 is trying to start xmms from cron
2005-12-12T12:47:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	Thanks
2005-12-12T12:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	all nics marked 'auto' in /etc/network/interfaces
2005-12-12T12:48:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	same deal 'auto' on ppp0
2005-12-12T12:48:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	Setting "auto ppp0" will automatically connect it on boot?
2005-12-12T12:49:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	depends - if you use pppoe - you're better off to just run 'sudo pppoeconf'
2005-12-12T12:50:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	sudo pppoeconf ?
2005-12-12T12:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	yup - if you're on adsl, that's the ticket
2005-12-12T12:51:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	Excellent. Thanks.
2005-12-12T13:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	intel rock
2005-12-12T13:05:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	What about this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IJOR/qid=1133937688/sr=8-4/ref=pd_bbs_4/102-2237029-0621702?n=507846&s=electronics&v=glance
2005-12-12T13:07:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	you own that? or considering buying? Microsoft Networking 10/100 Ethernet PCI Adapter
2005-12-12T13:08:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	It's called a joke :)
2005-12-12T13:08:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	I'm trying to find about 3 NICs so I can make myself a router.
2005-12-12T13:09:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	Or should I just buy a big ol' switch and play with that?
2005-12-12T13:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	ok - lol - but the chipset on those might work, then again, I wouldn't bet on it
2005-12-12T13:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	would 3 x intel pro 10/100 be doable ?
2005-12-12T13:10:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	If I can find them for under about $10 each, maybe.
2005-12-12T13:11:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	Not sure whether I should just buy a plain ol' hardware router/switch, though.
2005-12-12T13:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	Orborde	you can do some funky qos stuff with iptables - it's an option - re: driver support http://www.scyld.com/eepro100.html
2005-12-12T13:12:00.000Z	Orborde	frogzoo	So that would be an option in favor of buying a stack of NICs?
