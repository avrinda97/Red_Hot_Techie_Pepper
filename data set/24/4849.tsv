2006-12-29T07:58:00.000Z	imbecile		okay you guys i have a question.. can i install kde apps on gnome desktop?? i feel so stupid asking this
2006-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	imbecile		nice
2006-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	yes they will pull kde also probably
2007-07-03T08:01:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 it showed all  the ports i opened
2007-07-03T08:01:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	but localhost doesn't really go though the firewall if he has one setup
2007-07-03T08:02:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 ant commands to throw at it so it does?
2007-07-03T08:04:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	man nmap but I m not sure myself but you could use netstat to see
2007-07-14T09:43:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	you could do cd /home/imbecile/.trash sudo rm kiba-dock
2007-07-14T09:43:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	or add the -f switch to rm
2007-07-14T09:44:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 its telling me no such file or directory
2007-07-14T09:45:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	for what rm?
2007-07-14T09:46:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 yeah
2007-07-14T09:47:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	try sudo /bin/rm -f kiba-dock might need the path to rm
2007-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 it didnt worki managed to drag it to the desktop
2007-11-27T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	easy root is locked in ubuntu but it's the same thing really
2007-12-02T01:03:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	well youtube I think is .avi but doesn't matter since it uses a flash overlay anyways
2007-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 so i make the file a .avi?
2007-12-02T01:05:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	maybe look at YouTube's upload policy I don't bother with it much
2007-12-02T01:06:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 well what i need to know is what format of video does istanbul save as?
2007-12-02T01:06:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	probably .avi find out by saving a file
2007-12-02T01:06:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 i tried saving & it had no file extension
2007-12-02T01:06:00.000Z	kitche	imbecile	then it's probably .avi just give it an extenstion then
2007-12-02T01:07:00.000Z	imbecile	kitche	 thanks
