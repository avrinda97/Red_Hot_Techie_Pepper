2011-06-24T21:14:00.000Z	L551		I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04, and now my touchpad scroll no longer works. Can someone help?
2011-06-24T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	what make / model laptop?
2011-06-24T21:17:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	HP Mini 311
2011-06-24T21:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	it's a crucial piece of information for your question ;) please give full details in future
2011-06-24T21:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	tried disabling touchpad tapping for click?
2011-06-24T21:19:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	It did nothing.
2011-06-24T21:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	is there a switch to enable / disable to pad?
2011-06-24T21:20:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	Physical switch? No, there is not.
2011-06-24T21:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	can also try: gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad_enabled --type=bool true
2011-06-24T21:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	or a shortcut key
2011-06-24T21:21:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	There is no shortcut to disable the pad.
2011-06-24T21:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	does the command I gave work?
2011-06-24T21:22:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	The command did not fix the problem, no.
2011-06-24T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	ok if you open a terminal and run:   xev     do the mouse keys make events?
2011-06-24T21:25:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	The mouse keys do, but it is acting that there is no scroll whatsoever
2011-06-24T21:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	i see
2011-06-24T21:26:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	It worked on 10.10, so I don't know.

2011-06-24T21:28:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	That's more for the touchpad not responding whatsoever. It works, I can click, just not scroll.
2011-06-24T21:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	might fix your issue too
2011-06-24T21:29:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	I guess I'll be back in a few minutes then.
2011-06-24T21:37:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	Still acting like there is no scroll.
2011-06-24T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L551	are there bugs reported?
2011-06-24T21:37:00.000Z	L551	ActionParsnip	I have no idea.
