2012-03-24T22:42:00.000Z	nujabes		gandhijee, they do make drivers for ubuntu, so i was thinking they might have the drivers for you along with instructions
2012-03-24T22:44:00.000Z	nujabes		is it wrong to post links on here?
2012-03-24T22:44:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	depends on the reason.
2012-03-24T22:44:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	links are ok if they are being used as tools to do something allowed on this channel (help or ask for help)
2012-03-24T22:55:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	are you asking how to know what commands you have available?
2012-03-24T22:57:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	you are looking for its "options" or "flags"
2012-03-24T22:57:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	that is what man pages are for :-)
2012-03-24T22:57:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	i guess its option. idk what flags are
2012-03-24T22:58:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	didn't come with a man page lol
2012-03-24T22:58:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
2012-03-24T22:58:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	clamav -h?
2012-03-24T23:00:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	ok so the command clam or clamav doesn't work after i installed the package clamav. so how can i find the executables?
2012-03-24T23:01:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	dpkg --listfiles clamav
2012-03-24T23:03:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	it shows what files are attached to the package. Anything in /usr/bin is probably an executable.
2012-03-24T23:03:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	the package
2012-03-24T23:15:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	if i wanted to write a script so i don't have to run a program via terminal everytime. do i just write the bash script in a txt and save it?
2012-03-24T23:16:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	everyone else pretty much answered :-)
2012-03-24T23:17:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	lol
2012-03-24T23:18:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	read a blog post. Use google ;-)
2012-03-24T23:19:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	okay okay
2012-03-24T23:19:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	ask a question here after showing that you at least did a cursory google search ;-)
2012-03-24T23:20:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	_Marcus I have been helping him. But now he is asking questions that are better answered by google. If he has issues finding information or understanding it, I would gladly answer his questions.
2012-03-24T23:24:00.000Z	smw	nujabes	I need to go. Good luck :-)
2012-03-24T23:24:00.000Z	nujabes	smw	hey thanks man
