2012-09-28T19:48:00.000Z	paulens12		so, i have two pieces of free space. 1st is 30gb and 2nd is 36gb
2012-09-28T19:49:00.000Z	paulens12		how much space is reccommended for running ubuntu with some apps?
2012-09-28T19:50:00.000Z	paulens12		oh and, i could use the 2nd part of space to install apps?
2012-09-28T19:50:00.000Z	paulens12		should i mount it as /usr folder?
2012-09-28T19:50:00.000Z	paulens12		yyeah so...
2012-09-28T19:50:00.000Z	paulens12		can you tell me, which folder sonsumes most of space?
2012-09-28T19:51:00.000Z	paulens12		root? or usr?
2012-09-28T19:51:00.000Z	paulens12		oh
2012-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	paulens12		ok so i guess it would be perfect, if i use one partition to install, and mount another as /usr?
2012-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	paulens12		or not? lol
2012-09-28T19:52:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	one partition is enough
2012-09-28T19:53:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	dont forget tho, that you need a swap partition as well
2012-09-28T19:53:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	you want to dualboot windows and ubuntu, right?
2012-09-28T19:54:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	its no problem. the second partition (where windows is on) will be accessible anyways. you need to install linux on the partition where windows isnt installed
2012-09-28T19:55:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	ah okay, you could probably delete these two partitions and make one out of them
2012-09-28T19:57:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	what files are those?
2012-09-28T19:57:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	okay. on which of those two partitions is windows installed? 30gb or 36gb?
2012-09-28T19:59:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	then just install it on a free partition, its not that hard ^^ you will be able to access the files from the other partitions/drives thru linux anyways, if you didnt use bitlocker
2012-09-28T20:00:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	it depends on what you want to do with the system
2012-09-28T20:02:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	36gb should be enough I guess...
2012-09-28T20:02:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	unlike windows, ubuntu doesnt need that much disk space
2012-09-28T20:04:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	if you have a spare hard drive somewhere, try to use that for linux. ^^
2012-09-28T20:06:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	about the partitioning, ask others. I'm still fairly new to ubuntu and didnt do anything like partitioning for some folder only and stuff like that yet
2012-09-28T20:07:00.000Z	chris92	paulens12	cant help you with that unfortunately. it works tho, as others are talking about it right now :) e.g. actionParsnip is in a discussion about that right now :P
