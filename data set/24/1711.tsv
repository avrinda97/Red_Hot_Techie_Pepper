2009-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	How did you try to install java the very first time?
2009-09-24T07:55:00.000Z	zonedfull1	bobertdos	My girlfriend tried to do it and she insatlled via synaptic an she innstalle everyting with java there...5 and 6....do I have to reformat again?
2009-09-24T07:56:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	oh boy
2009-09-24T07:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Uninstall everything java related that you can from Synaptic.
2009-09-24T07:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	What's the error you get with Synaptic.
2009-09-24T08:02:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Basically, our goal is to get the stuff that's already been installed purged so we can try and start fresh. Here's a hint for future reference. If your comfortable with the terminal, apt-get is your friend. Synaptic is not always so much your friend :P
2009-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Okay, now, make this easier on yourself and use the terminal to begin with. Use sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin. For flash, we need to make sure the multiverse repo is enabled and then sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree.
2009-09-24T08:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Installing java will ask you to accept the license agreement. Don't forget to use tab to move around when that happens.
2009-09-24T08:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Okay, so then let's turn our attention to Firefox.
2009-09-24T08:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	In the terminal, do sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree.
2009-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Okay, so check about:plugins in Firefox. If you have Gnash or other flash alternatives in there, they need to die.
2009-09-24T08:25:00.000Z	zonedfull1	bobertdos	I have shockwave flash there
2009-09-24T08:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Anything else besides shockwave flash? What version does it list?
2009-09-24T08:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Eee, yeah, not good
2009-09-24T08:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Are you on jaunty?
2009-09-24T08:31:00.000Z	zonedfull1	bobertdos	shall I remove the shockwave flash then
2009-09-24T08:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	yes
2009-09-24T08:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	You're not trying Koala, are you?
2009-09-24T08:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	No, I mean Ubuntu version
2009-09-24T08:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	sudo apt-get purge libflashplayer-nonfree.
2009-09-24T08:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Yes, then do the opposite, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree. If that still doesn't work, purge it again and you can try downloading the deb installer from adobe's site.
2009-09-24T08:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Are you using 64-bit Ubuntu?
2009-09-24T08:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	zonedfull1	Also, if you go into System->Administration->Software Sources, are all the repos checked?
