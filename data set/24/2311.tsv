2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	moljac024		hey guys I need help
2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	moljac024		does anyone have any idea why network manager wouldn't be able to handle wireless ?
2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	moljac024		it doesn't pick up any signals
2009-02-02T22:59:00.000Z	moljac024		ifconfig shows wlan0 present
2009-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	use iwconfig
2009-02-02T23:00:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	this isn't my computer
2009-02-02T23:01:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	what version of ubuntu is he using?
2009-02-02T23:02:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	nm-applet in roaming mode
2009-02-02T23:02:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	that's the thing
2009-02-02T23:03:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	sure that the laptop has no on/off switch for the wifi radio
2009-02-02T23:04:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	sure
2009-02-02T23:04:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	try sudo aptitude
2009-02-02T23:04:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	I tried the gnome menu entry
2009-02-02T23:04:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	it should ask for password from menu
2009-02-02T23:05:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	hold on, there's another wireless/wired network manager that's good, can't recall, anyone else??
2009-02-02T23:05:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	it doesn't, I'm afraid of even begging to look a little deeper to find out what the heck is wrong with the system
2009-02-02T23:05:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	do you mean wicd ?
2009-02-02T23:07:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	yes, wicd
2009-02-02T23:08:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	what does iwconfig show?
2009-02-02T23:08:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	hold on
2009-02-02T23:10:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	gotta go, IM me if you need more help
2009-02-02T23:11:00.000Z	moljac024	slb_	I found it
2009-02-02T23:12:00.000Z	slb_	moljac024	good to go?
