2011-11-03T06:32:00.000Z	lord_enzo		what I can do is reinstall the system, as it doesn't take long, and I have nothing in the computer, start it again with the nomodeset option, but I would like to know what to do after that… where can I get some proper drivers, or not…
2011-11-03T06:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	 what chipset

2011-11-03T06:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	nvudia or ati chipset? not the brand.
2011-11-03T06:35:00.000Z	lord_enzo		nvidia
2011-11-03T06:35:00.000Z	lord_enzo		sorry
2011-11-03T06:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	 install with nomodeset, boot with nomodeset, install nvudia drivers, reboot with out nomodeset
2011-11-03T06:37:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	that's what I have almost done, I started with ACPI off, then, booted with nomodeset, and Installed one of the two packages the system prompted me to activate, and then, I cannot start with or without nomodeset
2011-11-03T06:38:00.000Z	lord_enzo		should I start from scratch again?  :(
2011-11-03T06:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	 with 11.10 for me i dont evenneed nomodeset at all.... on my 4 nvudia nqchines
2011-11-03T06:40:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	don't know, it's my first time with a linux, and it's being a nightmare! I don't know what happens… In my Mac laptop (with nvidia also) it works perfectly.. being a mac! but with the AMD/nvidia one it's crazy
2011-11-03T06:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	 the mac works but nirmal pc has ussues hmm..
2011-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis		emery drag and drop perhaps
2011-11-03T06:43:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	what I meant, is that mac starts with EFI and all the stuff, and they have all that proprietary hardware/software, and it doesn't give me problems, but the other, which should work straight away doesn't… i don't have problems assuming it's my fault, but I keep frustrating
2011-11-03T06:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	what exact nvudia chipset?
2011-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	zotac gts250 1gb tells you something?
2011-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	gts250 is the exact chipset im guessing
2011-11-03T06:46:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	that means I'm screwed?
2011-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	lord_enzo	 no idea.  i think my desktop has a gts230 that works fine.
2011-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	dr_willis		bbl
2011-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	well, I'm resintalling it again, starting with nomodeset from the beginning and not using acpi off), after that I will boot with nomodeset again (if necessary, which I think it will be) and I'll ask again which package of drivers I should install of the ones that the system let me choose. By the way, I chose 64bit system, not the 32… i don't know if this can come from there…
2011-11-03T06:54:00.000Z	lord_enzo	dr_willis	reinstalled, now I'm trying to boot for the fist time
