2007-04-24T05:32:00.000Z	linxeh		sigh
2007-04-24T05:33:00.000Z	linxeh		whatever
2007-04-24T05:33:00.000Z	linxeh		it's a good job there aren't any new linux / ubuntu users. they might get the impression that the linux community is right up its own backside
2007-04-24T05:35:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	can you help me?
2007-04-24T05:36:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	what is the problem?
2007-04-24T05:36:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	i'm trying to install ubuntu 7.04 and the mouse is not working (PS/2)
2007-04-24T05:36:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	ok - was it plugged in when you booted the machine ?
2007-04-24T05:36:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	yes
2007-04-24T05:37:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	ok, and when you powered the machine on ?
2007-04-24T05:37:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	yes
2007-04-24T05:38:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	I need to download the install + alternative isos for work tomorrow anyway, so I might be able to try it out my system here
2007-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	I don't understand what relationship does that have with me...
2007-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	let me try with my mouse, wait a minute pls
2007-04-24T05:40:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	obviously none. I shall refrain from answering anyone in here again
2007-04-24T05:40:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	I tried my mouse, and, as I thought, it didn't work at all
2007-04-24T05:41:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	I'll try my USB keyboard with PS/2 port in the side
2007-04-24T05:41:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	make sure you powercycle the machine though
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	what is that, and how do I do that?
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	turn the computer off for 10 secs then back on
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	I guess I can try that. Anyway it won't work, I'm sure.
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	ok, whatever.
2007-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	linxeh	debaser	good luck
2007-04-24T05:43:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	I had the same problem in archlinux, and I couldn't fix it. thx
2007-04-24T05:57:00.000Z	debaser	linxeh	as I thought: it didn't work at all
