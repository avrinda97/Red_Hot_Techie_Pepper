2010-05-06T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	yeah i believe the font is terminal, let me check
2010-05-06T20:33:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	please give more information about the default font, name, size, I want to configure my URXVT to have that font as default
2010-05-06T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	seems it doesnt want to tell me, let me see if guake is nicer
2010-05-06T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	monospace maybe?
2010-06-05T22:41:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	The existing grub is grub 1
2010-06-05T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	grub and grub2 are the same on any Linux as its the same project
2010-06-05T22:44:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	I didn't install grub on ubuntu, I just want to add kernel and intird lines on the existing grub menu so that I can boot into ubuntu
2010-06-05T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	then you can copy one of the existing entries which currently work and change the partition referenced
2010-06-05T23:03:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	Actually I tried to add ubuntu's booting entry into the existing grub menu, but failed, saying: Error 15: File not found,
2010-06-05T23:04:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	there is a grub.cfg file in /boot/grub on ubuntu /boot, and I referenced that file when adding the entry
2010-06-05T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	then it'll need tweaking, i'm not good with grub as I only single boot
2010-06-05T23:04:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	Does it have anything to do with encrypted file system ?
2010-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	even I do purely manually command line in grub> , could not find the kernel image with kernel command in /boot, weird
2010-06-05T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	sure, if you install grub2 it should detect the OSes afaik
2010-06-05T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	could as in #grub
2010-06-05T23:42:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	First of all, I'm not sure if I installed grub on the partition where ubuntu is installed ; secondly I'm not on ubuntu, and I can't get ubuntu booted after installation since there is no loading program that loads ubuntu successfully, there is an existing grub installed on MBR, but I tried to edit the menu.lst file on another Linux dist , but still could not get newly installed ubuntu booted
2010-06-05T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	you can boot to the other OSes and install grub2 there, or boot to ubuntu livecd and install grub2 thre
2010-06-05T23:43:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	why do I need to install grub2 ?
2010-06-05T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	i'm not good at grub dude, i've never had to mess wit it as I never dual boot
2010-06-05T23:50:00.000Z	Pip	ActionParsnip	Okay, thanks all the same
2010-06-05T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pip	use: sudo blkid   to make sure the UUID is right and that the boot files you specified are correct
