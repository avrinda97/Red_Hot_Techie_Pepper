2010-06-27T08:01:00.000Z	vaul		Could anyone tell me a command of the «CD/DVD» creator application launcher?
2010-06-27T08:01:00.000Z	vaul		Accidentaly deleted it.
2010-06-27T08:02:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	"brasero"?
2010-06-27T08:02:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	No.
2010-06-27T08:02:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	:/
2010-06-27T08:02:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	Look at the «Edit menu» thing, they are different application.
2010-06-27T08:03:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	Applications, I meant.
2010-06-27T08:03:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	oh right, w8
2010-06-27T08:04:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	It's all due to this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alacarte/+bug/118936 bug, which is not fixed for some three years.
2010-06-27T08:04:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	  the command is:  nautilus --no-default-window --no-desktop burn:///
2010-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	Please recheck, it gives me an error.
2010-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	hmm, it works here. try leaving a space after burn:///
2010-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	I though that ":///" part is some weird smile. :)
2010-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	lol
2010-06-27T08:09:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	Now you why that "wrapping" near commands is neccessary sometimes. :)
2010-06-27T08:09:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	Thank you, it works.
2010-06-27T08:11:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	in most cases to wrap filenames. instead of giving for example: command -i my\ file, you need the '\ ' to escape the spaces in the filename; an easier way is: command -i "my file"
2010-06-27T08:12:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	I knew that. I meant wrapping in quotes in the chat, when communicating.
2010-06-27T08:14:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	ah, for example, to separate your own text from the cmd you are giving to someone? for example: to list your files give "ls" in a terminal
2010-06-27T08:15:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	I am not sure if this is correct, but I do so most of the time.
2010-06-27T08:15:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	:)
2010-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	But in worst case you also need to mention not to type quotes in the terminal.
2010-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	vaul	kostkon	But luckily, it seldom happens.
2010-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	kostkon	vaul	yes, it's best to put it in a parenthesis at the end of your text, for example
