2007-12-20T23:32:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	I think it's intel
2007-12-20T23:29:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	sounds like a driver issue to me, what hardware you runnin?
2007-12-20T23:30:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	do you mean what graphics card?
2007-12-20T23:30:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	thats right
2007-12-20T23:32:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	well, thats a very poor 3d accelerator
2007-12-20T23:33:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	what do you mean?
2007-12-20T23:34:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	Intel's 3d accelerators are crappy, I'd imagine any support for them would be poor
2007-12-20T23:35:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	I see. what would you suggest for proper hardware to get good 3d acceleration.
2007-12-20T23:35:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	Nvidia Geforce 6 series
2007-12-20T23:36:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	I have seen a lot about those on the ubuntu forums.
2007-12-20T23:36:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	yeah, Ubuntu supports both ATI and Nvidia cards natively now
2007-12-20T23:37:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	do you have an AGP system? I'd imagine you do.
2007-12-20T23:38:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	AGP? what's that? sorry my ignorance.
2007-12-20T23:58:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	I turned off my computer to look at my chips and then realized I can just view through the system monitor what my chips are.
2007-12-20T23:58:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	yup, lspci in the term will show you
2007-12-20T23:59:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	now that I am back wols is mia. They or you were asking what my chipset was.
2007-12-20T23:59:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	I was asking what video card
2007-12-21T00:01:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	intel 845
2007-12-21T00:01:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	yeah, terrible 3d chipset
2007-12-21T00:08:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	probably a good idea if you want to do 3d graphics
2007-12-21T00:09:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	I was already considering it, but thought I would try to fix what I have first.
2007-12-21T00:09:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	yeah, understandible
2007-12-21T00:33:00.000Z	Phusion	hiddenghost	any newer graphics card you buy will probably help
2007-12-21T00:34:00.000Z	hiddenghost	Phusion	ok, then that's that. new graphics card it is.
