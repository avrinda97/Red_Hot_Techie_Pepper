2007-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	illriginal		Does anyone know how to change the font color of taskbar and menu list on the desktop?
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	I believe I know how
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	In System > Themes > Customize there is a tab at the top called "colors"
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	illriginal	lxuser	would you be able to help me step by step on how to change the font color? I have a dark background and I cannot see the date/time nor the name of the windows I have opened
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	In gnome?
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	illriginal		lsuser, correct
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	illriginal		I went to System, Preference, Theme, but there's no "color" option
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	illriginal		wait, I see it now hold on! lsuser
2007-05-30T15:07:00.000Z	illriginal		lxuser*
2007-05-30T15:07:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	im a bit slow but i will try. OK, In the system menu under preferences
2007-05-30T15:07:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	at the bottom click on themes
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	illriginal		right?
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	to the right It says "Customize"
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	illriginal		right
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	illriginal		input boxes?
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	click on that and at the top there should be a tab called colors
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	illriginal		lsuser right
2007-05-30T15:08:00.000Z	illriginal		lxuser*
2007-05-30T15:09:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	to the left are your back ground colors and to the right there are text colors. I think that is what you want.
2007-05-30T15:09:00.000Z	lxuser		I think "Window" is your menu also  illriginal
2007-05-30T15:09:00.000Z	illriginal	lxuser	nope not it bro... alright do this lxuser, look on your taskbar where it shows the time (normally on the top right corner)
2007-05-30T15:09:00.000Z	illriginal	lxuser	you'll see that the font is black
2007-05-30T15:10:00.000Z	illriginal	lxuser	because my background is dark, I can barely see that text of the time because it's black
2007-05-30T15:10:00.000Z	lxuser	illriginal	Sorry mate, I dont know how to edit that.
