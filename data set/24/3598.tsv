2010-06-02T21:40:00.000Z	jake	soreau	how do i do that?
2010-06-02T21:40:00.000Z	soreau	jake	In the grub menu entry, it should have at least two entries, one being recovery mode
2010-06-02T21:42:00.000Z	jake	soreau	root, kernak..., and initrd
2010-06-02T21:43:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Then on the kernel line, you would replace quiet with single
2010-06-02T21:47:00.000Z	jake	soreau	that put a whole bunch of stuff up on the screeen as it booted then it died it is a black screeen w/ no promop
2010-06-02T21:48:00.000Z	soreau	jake	that sucks man. How did this start happening?
2010-06-02T21:49:00.000Z	jake	soreau	my libcups2 was updating and the computer turned off and now im in the state
2010-06-02T21:49:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Do you know how to boot a live cd and chroot into the file system?
2010-06-02T21:51:00.000Z	jake	soreau	i got it so i have a promtp
2010-06-02T21:51:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Ok now first thing to do is 'apt-get update && apt-get upgrade'
2010-06-02T21:51:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Make sure that returns without error
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	soreau	jake	ifconfig $IFACE up
2010-06-02T21:53:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Replace $IFACE with the real name of the interface (as reported by ifconfig)
2010-06-02T21:54:00.000Z	soreau	jake	what says that?
2010-06-02T21:54:00.000Z	soreau	jake	use ifconfig wlan0 up
2010-06-02T21:56:00.000Z	soreau	jake	that indicates success
2010-06-02T21:57:00.000Z	soreau	jake	What command is giving you that message? kinda hard for us to guess :P
2010-06-02T21:58:00.000Z	soreau	jake	Why are you trying to use ifup? The iface should already be up if 'ifconfig wlan0 up' succeeded
2010-06-02T22:01:00.000Z	soreau	jake	I assume you're trying to connect to the wireless ap. Does iwconfig show wlan9 iface?
2010-06-02T22:09:00.000Z	jake	soreau	i got an IP and im doing the updates now
2010-06-02T22:10:00.000Z	soreau	jake	cool
2010-06-02T22:13:00.000Z	soreau	jake	What's the error?
