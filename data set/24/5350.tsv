2006-12-26T08:15:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		Windows doesn't work, it is fragmented so I can't partition the drive, and I don't have the CD. It won't boot in any safe mode or anything.
2006-12-26T08:15:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		Yes, hope13.
2006-12-26T08:16:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		Or at least put something I can use (ubuntu) on the drive, hope13.
2006-12-26T08:16:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		No I don't, hope13.
2006-12-26T08:17:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		How do I mount the Windows partition, Goldfisch?
2006-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		No, hope13. Nothing works like that. Not rebooting from last good boot or anything. Safe mode with command line doesn't even boot.
2006-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		I don't know, Goldfisch. It is a IBM ThinkPad T22.
2006-12-26T08:19:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		You can't boot DOS with XP, FeliLixTKhat. XP isn't like Windows 98, it doesn't sit on top of DOS.
2006-12-26T08:21:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		Typing that in the command line doesn't tell me anything I can make sense of, Goldfisch. What exactly tells me whether it is ATA or SATA?
2006-12-26T08:22:00.000Z	Intelligitimate		This is not my computer, Goldfisch. The person would be willing to use Ubuntu, but he wants to recover some important files at least.
2006-12-26T08:23:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	SATA drives have a smaller connecting cable, compare to ATA, which uses the wide, thin ribbon cable inside the case. SATA mean Serial ATA drive.

2006-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	My Dad spotted a 2G flash stick at Best Buy last week for $40. It may be worth it to go get one. That should give you some flexibility. I have flash thumb drives many times in the past to work on systems.
2006-12-26T08:35:00.000Z	Intelligitimate	Goldfisch	is there anyway I can get my wireless working to send the files somewhere else?
2006-12-26T08:37:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	Not sure. Depends on the card model and all that good stuff. Whenever I shop for wireless cards, I always do a lot of homework to make sure there is documented compatability.
2006-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	Intelligitimate	Goldfisch	I have no idea what this one is. It doesn't have a name on it.
2006-12-26T08:40:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	Well, either "lspci -v" or "lsusb -v" may turn up some information. Can't remember if cardbus/pcmcia reports on either of those commands.
2006-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	Well, either lspci or cardctl is your ticket. Try those out and see if you get some info on your network card.
2006-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	Intelligitimate	Goldfisch	I am not sure what I am looking at.
2006-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	Paste it into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and then post a link on this channel.
2006-12-26T08:48:00.000Z	Intelligitimate	Goldfisch	I can't copy and paste...unless I manually typed out everything. Is there something specific I should look for?
2006-12-26T08:50:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	I don't have a laptop in front of me to run these commands, so I'm not sure what you are seeing. You want to find some indication of a network-based card like "802.11" and then some type of vendor/model number in close proximity. Are you in console mode, being the reason you can't cut-and-paste?
2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	I didn't mean the WIndows XP CD. I meant the CD of drivers that came with your wireless card.
2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Intelligitimate	I have one PC that uses a wireless card, and I haven't bought a windows disk for two years.
2006-12-26T09:04:00.000Z	Intelligitimate	Goldfisch	I think I just got an idea. I could possibly fix the NTFS partition with that NTFSFuse program.
