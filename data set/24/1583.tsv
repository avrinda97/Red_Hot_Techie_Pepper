2009-11-09T22:45:00.000Z	mka	code	what did you do?
2009-11-09T22:47:00.000Z	code	mka	Tried installing WIne. It complained of dependencies & tried to fix. libxrender*
2009-11-09T22:48:00.000Z	mka	code	in console type "sudo init 1"
2009-11-09T22:48:00.000Z	mka	code	and then select "xfix"
2009-11-09T22:48:00.000Z	code	mka	removed libxrender while trying to install Wine
2009-11-09T22:49:00.000Z	mka	code	then install libxrender
2009-11-09T22:50:00.000Z	mka	code	by the way, installing wine was supposed to be a straight forward process, did you compile it from source?
2009-11-09T22:51:00.000Z	code	mka	first ran ./configure and kept checking its dependency requrements. Thats when it became a prob
2009-11-09T22:52:00.000Z	mka	code	why you didnt use synaptic instead?
2009-11-09T22:53:00.000Z	mka	code	anyway just try installing your libxrender
2009-11-09T22:53:00.000Z	mka	code	try "sudo apt-cache search libxrender" first
2009-11-09T22:53:00.000Z	mka	code	then "sudo apt-get install <app_name>"
2009-11-09T23:01:00.000Z	code	mka	synaptic was the 1st thing i tried to install libxrender. It installed it but Wine did not work.
2009-11-09T23:01:00.000Z	mka	code	do you want wine or to log in to your machine?
2009-11-09T23:01:00.000Z	mka	code	did you fix your GUI login now?
2009-11-09T23:02:00.000Z	code	mka	after that i did apt-cache ....  and followed by install. It also installed it but wine kept complaining about deps
2009-11-09T23:02:00.000Z	mka	code	you should remove for now
2009-11-09T23:02:00.000Z	code	mka	right now desperate to get desktop back
2009-11-09T23:02:00.000Z	mka	code	"sudo apt-get remove wine"
2009-11-09T23:03:00.000Z	mka	code	then "sudo apt-get install <your app name>"
2009-11-09T23:03:00.000Z	code	mka	thats 1st step im dong now.
2009-11-09T23:04:00.000Z	mka	code	i have to go now, good luck.
