2012-10-30T20:48:00.000Z	PatrickC		ok, question.. anyone know what "/bin/bash/A" is suppose to be?
2012-10-30T20:49:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	/bin/bash is a directory on your system? weird...
2012-10-30T20:49:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	my error is "/bin/bash: A: command not found"
2012-10-30T20:49:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	ah.. something is trying to run a command using bash.. the command being "A" and bash responds that there is no such command
2012-10-30T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	what are you trying to run when you get this error?
2012-10-30T20:50:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	i'm trying to run A arm -T multi -C none -n "CWM tenderloin Multiboot" -d out/target/product/tenderloin/kernel: out/target/product/tenderloin/recovery.img
2012-10-30T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	my immediate guess would be a script used with filename containing spaces
2012-10-30T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	I'm guessing you got that off some webpage or readme file, right?
2012-10-30T20:51:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	in the output of trying to compile an android kernel
2012-10-30T20:51:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	sure the A is supposed to be there?
2012-10-30T20:51:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	almost 100% sure
2012-10-30T20:52:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	but you're not typing that in yourself? it's from the output of some kind of make/automake/configure script?
2012-10-30T20:52:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	yes. it's in a makefile
2012-10-30T20:54:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	ok, I've got a vague guess here..   the script might look something like this    $SOMEVARIABLE -A arm ..... and $SOMEVARIABLE is supposed to be a program of some kind needed for compiling this.. but for some reason this variable is empty and it then tries to run -A arm and so on
2012-10-30T20:54:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	that might be possible!
2012-10-30T20:54:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	check if you've got all the required packages installed.. there might be something missing
2012-10-30T20:56:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	from google I found something that looks like this $MKIMAGE -A arm -T multi -C none -n 'test-multi-image' -d    $MKIMAGE might be a tool to create an image-file
2012-10-30T20:56:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	i remember MKIMAGE for something else...
2012-10-30T21:14:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	i found the file that uses the -A
2012-10-30T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	great, did you find some way of fixing it?
2012-10-30T22:22:00.000Z	PatrickC	Slart	i found the issue :D i just defined the path to MKIMAGE in the source that required it heh
2012-10-30T22:23:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	ah.. nice =)
2012-10-30T22:23:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	odd that the configuration scripts didn't do that automagically..
2012-10-30T22:23:00.000Z	Slart	PatrickC	you're welcome
