2006-09-19T16:56:00.000Z	jbu		does anyone know how to edit a file through gedit as root while in ubuntu?  it says i dont have the required permissions
2006-09-19T16:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	gksudo gedit foo
2006-09-19T16:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	are you doing this from your first-created user?
2006-09-19T16:59:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	yes
2006-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	see how this line is hilighted?
2006-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	yes
2006-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	yes
2006-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	anyway with 800+ in here, it's handy
2006-09-19T05:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	did you misspeak?  sudo mount /foo is more the command
2006-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	whatever mountpoint is in fstab, not foo, of course
2006-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	hmm im just telling u what the tutorial told me to do
2006-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	it wants me to edit the fstab
2006-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	sudo mount /foo mounts things, sudo nano /etc/fstab edits that file, not mounting anything
2006-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	go ahead and edit it, but don't expect that edit command to mount anything :)  you need a "sudo mount /something" for that
2006-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	i've seen a couple of tutorials telling me to edit the file before mounting my partition
2006-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	yes, but i'm tryinf to stress that an edit is not a mount command
2006-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	oh ok
2006-09-19T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	it "just worked" for me, automatically, but some don't have that experience
2006-09-19T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	mine was a laptop, ipw2200
2006-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	i was able to module-assistant one of those, a cheap one even :)
2006-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	~$40usd
2006-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	mine was 10 bucks...so i'm worried that there wont be adapters for it?
2006-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	jbu	find out the chipset, then google
2006-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	jbu	eyequeue	i'll see..
