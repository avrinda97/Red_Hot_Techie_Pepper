2005-10-13T12:02:00.000Z	rukuartic		Anyone want to help me with installing ndiswrapper without using apt-get?
2005-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	rukuartic		Its all good.
2005-10-13T12:05:00.000Z	rukuartic		Working on building ndiswarpper-1.4rc4, but it says I need "source". Looks like thats 5 CSs of information. Anyway I could build it without the source?
2005-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	rukuartic		*CD
2005-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	rukuartic		Switching from windows... need help installing ndiswrapper so I can use Ubuntu to connect to the internet with a wireless card...
2005-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	WhyvasLT	rukuartic	what chipset?
2005-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	You mean the wireless card?
2005-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	dang. I had it written down, but I verified and its compatable.
2005-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	Nope. Can't get internet on linux box because the card doesn't work.
2005-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	That'll involve me rebooting and all that. Hold up, lemme look it up
2005-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	If you know off hand, is Linksys WMP54G
2005-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	Broadcom, I think.
2005-10-13T12:12:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	No wired card, and that'd involve running a cable down three stories.
2005-10-13T12:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	I read over the FAQ, and it says that I need the Kernel Source. Where do I pick that up?
2005-10-13T12:14:00.000Z	WhyvasLT	rukuartic	 you need the kernel source headers if you're compiling it
2005-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	Where do I find the kernel source headers?
2005-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	WhyvasLT	rukuartic	are you sure it isn't installed already
2005-10-13T12:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	I'm pretty sure, Mustard5: no internet connection.
2005-10-13T12:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	Where's it found? /lib/modules/kernel/build?
2005-10-13T12:17:00.000Z	WhyvasLT	rukuartic	you'd have to download them
2005-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	Yes... where do I find them?
2005-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	WhyvasLT	rukuartic	you need to find a way to wire your computer in for a minute
2005-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	I can download in windows, burn onto a CD, transport that way.
2005-10-13T12:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	WhyvasLT	No network card. Can't wire.
