2005-04-17T14:47:00.000Z	elcu		any opengl programmers? i'm trying to install mesa so i can write opengl programs, but i don't know which package to get.
2005-04-17T14:48:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	What graphic chipset are you using?
2005-04-17T14:49:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	That's not part of GL; apt-get install openglut-dev
2005-04-17T14:50:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	So I don't need Mesa?
2005-04-17T14:50:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	If it asks for glut.h, I guess you already have the other OpenGL headers. They were probably included when you installed the ATI drivers.
2005-04-17T15:07:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	I can't find opengl_dev in Synaptic
2005-04-17T15:08:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	I do however have some Mesa packages.
2005-04-17T15:12:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Do you have xlibmesa-gl-dev?
2005-04-17T15:13:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	yes.
2005-04-17T15:14:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	That folder may be elsewhere
2005-04-17T15:15:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	'locate' comes up with nothing.
2005-04-17T15:15:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Ihave /usr/include/GL, which contains links from /usr/X11R6/include/GL/
2005-04-17T15:15:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	Should I install that Mesa package?
2005-04-17T15:15:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Sounds like something wrong with your filesystem if the package is there, but the haeders are gone
2005-04-17T15:16:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Reinstall the xlibmesa-gl-dev package, then
2005-04-17T15:16:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	I haven't installed it yet. :-)  I thought you meant if I could see it in Synaptic ... which I can.
2005-04-17T15:16:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	No, I meant do you *currently* have it ;)
2005-04-17T15:16:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	Oh.  Then no. :-)
2005-04-17T15:17:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Then it's like I said first - just install that
2005-04-17T15:17:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	So that's the package to get then?
2005-04-17T15:17:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	It should be
2005-04-17T15:18:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	OK thanks.  I'll try it.
2005-04-17T15:18:00.000Z	EvilIdler	elcu	Get xlibmesa-dev, xlibmesa-gl-dev, xlibmesa-glu-dev
2005-04-17T15:19:00.000Z	elcu	EvilIdler	That was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks.
