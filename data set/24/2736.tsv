2008-09-19T00:50:00.000Z	Babbleback		why would i consistantly get a checksum error while trying to install flashplugin-nonfree
2008-09-19T00:50:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	what version of Ubuntu?
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	7.04
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	known issue, did you run sudo apt-get update?
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	yes
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	try upgrading to 8.04 then
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	failes
2008-09-19T00:51:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	failes and i have a broken system
2008-09-19T00:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	fails how?
2008-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	i make it 7.10 then the 8.04 upgrade fails.. don't remember if there was an error message or it just hangs, but i've tried to upgrade a 7.04 many times... i've actually only been able to download 8.04 without getting checksum errors also
2008-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	once that is
2008-09-19T00:53:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	it was probably the localegens error - easily solved
2008-09-19T00:54:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	ok
2008-09-19T00:54:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	is that with respect to my flash problem or my upgrading to 8.04 problem
2008-09-19T00:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	both.
2008-09-19T00:59:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	so what is the localegens error
2008-09-19T01:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	just ctrl-c everytime it's trying to generate the locale en_AU.UTF-8... and let the whole thing finish
2008-09-19T01:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	when you reboot, login and: sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-09-19T01:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	that's it :)
2008-09-19T01:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	you just press ctrl-c whenever you see the en_AU.UTF-8... (which is usually when it hangs and you won't see the HDD led blinking)
2008-09-19T01:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	the problem is that the new kernel version isn't actually loaded up, and to generate the locales, it's required. they can always be regenerated upon reboot
2008-09-19T01:25:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	you are responding to the inability to upgrade to 8.04 then right? doesn't apply to the flashplugin-nonfree problem other than I shouldn't have the problem in 8.04 correct?
2008-09-19T01:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Babbleback	once you have upgraded to 8.04, then the problem with the flashplugin-nonfree will simply disappear
2008-09-19T01:44:00.000Z	Babbleback	Gnea	why does it work fine when Firefox prompts for an install of flash but not via flashplugin-nonfree? that is if you put in the correct password; otherwise it believes it is installed and no longer prompts you though it failed
