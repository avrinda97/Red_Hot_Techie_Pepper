2007-01-24T14:40:00.000Z	b14ck		I just installed ubuntu on my laptop (dual boot with windows), and everything works fine after the install. but then, once i get to the first real boot up (after i've updated all the packages), the computer no longer boots... ubuntu hangs . anyone know how to fix this?

2007-01-24T14:42:00.000Z	b14ck		What the hell is a 'soft lockup'?
2007-01-24T14:42:00.000Z	b14ck		This is the 2nd time I've installed ubuntu and this has happened.
2007-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	b14ck		2nd time in a row
2007-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	b14ck		The first time I thought it was me...
2007-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	b14ck		The first time I thought I may have done something wrong.
2007-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	b14ck		Maybe I powered it down too early
2007-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	b14ck		But nope..
2007-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	b14ck		Can someone tell me what softlockup means? Does this mean it's time to install another distro?

2007-01-24T14:45:00.000Z	b14ck		if that makes a difference
2007-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	also here http://bughost.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1096 seems to be the ipw3945 wireless driver
2007-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	b14ck		hey Jowi... that link you gave me said that I shoould execute some commands, but I don't know how to do that since I can't boot up
2007-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	b14ck		turn dual core off??? wont that reduce the processing power significantly...
2007-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	better to disable that module if you're not using that wireless card
2007-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	b14ck	Jowi	how do I disable it though..
2007-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	b14ck		and also... jowi, i would like to use my wireless card (eventualy), would it still be possible?
2007-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	boot into the live cd. open a terminal. type "sudo -i". mount your ubuntu root partition. "nano /directory/whereyoumounted/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist" and add a line that says "blacklist ipw3945"
2007-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	b14ck		jowi, wkll i still be able to use my wireless card though?
2007-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	not if you blacklist it, no
2007-01-24T14:51:00.000Z	b14ck		jowi... i'm on a laptop and i want to use my wireless card though.
2007-01-24T14:52:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	no idea how to solve that dilemma unfortunatley. I do not have this hardware and its the first time I've seen the bug. just pointing you in a possible direction :)
2007-01-24T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	b14ck	according to this page https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/63418 a fix has been released for kernel source 2.6.19 and 2.6.20 (not for 2.6.17 yet)
