2006-06-01T13:59:00.000Z	pandamonium		you find a solution for one thing, only to find it busts another 27
2006-06-01T14:01:00.000Z	pandamonium		i can't update/upgrade/install anything. it just gives me one of a load of excuses
2006-06-01T14:01:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Eh?  Name one such excuse.
2006-06-01T14:02:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Is the Ubuntu machine connected to the Internet?
2006-06-01T14:02:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	it is, yes
2006-06-01T14:02:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	i believe it's a web proxy issue... i need to find a way to explicitly set http proxies
2006-06-01T14:02:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Oh, okay!  We can handle that.
2006-06-01T14:05:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	i'm going to give my isp some grief over it though. i told them about the broken cache ages ago and they told me to explicitly set a working one... but they haven't fixed the broken one
2006-06-01T14:05:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Well, good, ISPs should be given grief if they don't provide good internet service. (-:
2006-06-01T14:07:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	their telephone support is a joke... it sends you round and round a menu system before it finally tells you "this number is unavailable" and then cuts you off... honestly, it's like something out of the twilight zone
2006-06-01T14:12:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	That's pretty weird.
2006-06-01T14:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	that seems right.
2006-06-01T14:21:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and ALL files in /etc/apt ?
2006-06-01T14:21:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Right, or you could just let me log in and try. (-;
2006-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	i've uploaded the info you asked for to some webspace
2006-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Well, fine, URL?
2006-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	did you get a chance to see the info yet?
2006-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	No, did you give me a URI to it?
2006-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	I don't think you did.
2006-06-01T14:57:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	You have to be registered with NickServ for private messages to work.
2006-06-01T14:59:00.000Z	paulproteus	pandamonium	Hah, okay.
2006-06-01T15:10:00.000Z	pandamonium	paulproteus	did you get the link ok?
