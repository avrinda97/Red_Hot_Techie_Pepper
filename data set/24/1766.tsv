2010-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	Hagus		How do I get my webserver back, please?
2010-05-16T02:11:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	you lost it?
2010-05-16T02:12:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	I think you might have to give me some more details.. what version of ubuntu are you using, which webserver were you using.. how do you know it's gone and so on
2010-05-16T02:15:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	well.. you can run "lsb_release -a" in a terminal.. you might be able to check the help, about menu as well
2010-05-16T02:15:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	Apache perhaps? there is no webserver installed by default.. at least not on the desktop install
2010-05-16T02:16:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	are you running the regular desktop install? ie with the Gnome gui, pretty boot up logo and such.. or is it ubuntu server (no gui, just command line)
2010-05-16T02:17:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	yea, you can try installing apache again.. either by using synaptic or apt-get.. either way will work
2010-05-16T02:18:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	give it a try.. you might need to configure apache but give it a try.. see what happens
2010-05-16T02:20:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	hmm.. can you pastebin the error? by text or screenshot.. either way is fine
2010-05-16T02:22:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	hang on.. let me try installing emacs here on my system.. see if it does the same thing to me
2010-05-16T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	ok, it worked on my machine.. but let's remove it and see if we can't get your apache working first
2010-05-16T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	try running this in a terminal    "sudo dpkg --remove emacs22"
2010-05-16T02:27:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	ok, do the same with this package as well    "sudo dpkg --remove emacs22-gtk"
2010-05-16T02:27:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	then try this    "sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install"
2010-05-16T02:28:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	hopefully it will just run through without any errors
2010-05-16T02:29:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	I don't think so
2010-05-16T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	ok, so apache is already installed.. perhaps it isn't configured yet
2010-05-16T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	try this   "sudo service apache start"
2010-05-16T02:33:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	try   sudo service apache2 start   instead
2010-05-16T02:36:00.000Z	Hagus	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu.com/434039/
2010-05-16T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	seems apache is running.. hmm
2010-05-16T03:02:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	ah.. great!
2010-05-16T03:02:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	you're welcome
2010-05-16T03:03:00.000Z	Slart	Hagus	always a pleasure removing emacs =)
