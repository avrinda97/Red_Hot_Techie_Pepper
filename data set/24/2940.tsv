2008-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	jameslr	techsupport	nothing in /var/log/messages?
2008-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	techsupport	jameslr	there is a lot of output in /var/log/messages but not sure what to look at
2008-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	jameslr	techsupport	tail -f /var/log/messages should give you a running list of the last lines which should give you any error messages that are recent
2008-06-17T08:19:00.000Z	jameslr		if you keep a tail on the log and start the service - surely something comes up
2008-06-17T08:19:00.000Z	techsupport	jameslr	http://pastebin.com/d3d9d46a7
2008-06-17T08:21:00.000Z	jameslr	techsupport	you need to chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql for sure. The user your mentioned is the user account you're logged in as not the service account for mysql
2008-06-17T08:21:00.000Z	jameslr	techsupport	unless you changed it...
