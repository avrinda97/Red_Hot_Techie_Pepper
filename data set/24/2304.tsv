2012-10-12T09:07:00.000Z	home		someone teach me how to transfer files from my Windows computer to my Linux computer via SSH
2012-10-12T09:08:00.000Z	home		Xubuntu, in this case
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	home		for example, Let's say that I have a file located at C:\Users\Awesome\My Documents\xx.png
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	home		How would I transfer that via scp
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	home		or ssh?
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	home		to my xubuntu box? at its document folder?
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	scp uses the ssh protocol
2012-10-12T09:09:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	download winscp
2012-10-12T09:10:00.000Z	home	RiXtEr	can I use Putty?
2012-10-12T09:10:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	not for file transfers as far as I know
2012-10-12T09:10:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	you could setup samba
2012-10-12T09:10:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	winscp then
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	you could also download pscp from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html and use the command pscp c:\path\to\file user@ip.to.ssh.serv:/path/to save
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	winscp just gives you a nice gui frontend to do the exact same thing.
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	home	RiXtEr	did winscp
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	both use the ssh protocol
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	home	RiXtEr	thanks for the information though
2012-10-12T09:13:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	no problem
2012-10-12T09:19:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	did you give it root credentials?
2012-10-12T09:19:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	it still must respect linux filesystem attributes.
2012-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	PermitRootLogin  yes is default
2012-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	wrong file
2012-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	home	RiXtEr	yeah, thats right
2012-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	RiXtEr	home	ssh_config isn't sshd_config
