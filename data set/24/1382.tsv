2010-02-10T02:31:00.000Z	seren		hello, no matter what I change I can't find out how to allow apache2 to write from a symlink to my home directory, the symlinks are /var/www/wtorrent/torrents and /var/www/wtorrent/data they point to ~/Downloads/Finished and ~/Downloads/Add,  here is a paste of the revelant info http://pastie.org/817082
2010-02-10T02:32:00.000Z	waggy	seren	you need to setup virtualhosts using rapache
2010-02-10T02:33:00.000Z	seren	waggy	i assume there is a article in wiki?
2010-02-10T02:33:00.000Z	waggy	seren	 yeah google will give you a head start
2010-02-10T02:36:00.000Z	seren	waggy	imm assuming rapache is just a script to write a virtual host configuraiton?
2010-02-10T02:37:00.000Z	seren	waggy	o i c
2010-02-10T02:38:00.000Z	waggy	seren	http://picasaweb.google.com/emgentili/Rapache#
2010-02-10T02:42:00.000Z	seren	waggy	is there a more etailed explination you can suggest, i dont need a gui to edit the configurations
2010-02-10T02:43:00.000Z	waggy	seren	why do you need a symlink?  why not just setup the location of the virtual host as your folder in home (where you try to link to)
2010-02-10T02:44:00.000Z	seren	waggy	because i have a folder in my web dir that is pointing to my home folder
2010-02-10T02:45:00.000Z	waggy	seren	yeah, but what I'm saying is, and perhaps I'm not following you here, but why not just setup /home/name/torrents/w/e as your virtual host direct?
2010-02-10T02:45:00.000Z	seren	waggy	did you look at my paste?
2010-02-10T02:45:00.000Z	waggy	seren	no sorry, I'll have a look
2010-02-10T02:46:00.000Z	seren	waggy	i have my downloads folder in my virtual host
2010-02-10T02:46:00.000Z	seren	waggy	o crud i only added the web root
2010-02-10T02:46:00.000Z	seren	waggy	one sec
2010-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	seren	waggy	so i do this right I ass </Directory>
2010-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	waggy	seren	You're perhaps more on the ball than me with this, but does apache have write privileges/is it a member of a group to write to the location?
2010-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	seren	waggy	ya apache is in my users group
2010-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	waggy	seren	I'm stumped then! sorry! =0)

2010-02-10T02:57:00.000Z	waggy	seren	how?
2010-02-10T02:57:00.000Z	seren	waggy	i had a .htaccess file that had the wrong user in it, was something i over looked
