2008-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, How do I use find to search non case sensitive
2008-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	command line or GUI?
2008-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	FluxD		commandline
2008-02-16T14:47:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	theres a gui for find?
2008-02-16T14:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	instead of -name,  -iname ...  there's gui's that search for files, though i don't know that they specifically use the command "find"
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	gnome-search-tool ?
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	are you familiar with the "find" command?
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	FluxD		yes prince_jammys thats what I was asking
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	yes, gnome-search-tool is one
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	:    find /starting/path  -iname 'nametofind'
2008-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	I want to use find and search for all cases of mysql, MYSQL, mySQL etc
2008-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	FluxD		iname makes it case independent ?
2008-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	 -iname is case insensitive, as opposed to -name
2008-02-16T14:49:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	default find is also case sensitive rifht?
2008-02-16T14:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	within the entire filesystem::   sudo find / -iname '*mysql*'   or sudo find / -iname 'mysql*'
2008-02-16T14:51:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	ok ty
2008-02-16T14:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	* if mysql is only part of the file name
2008-02-16T14:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	an alternate way is ::  locate filename  <--- this searches a saved index of your file system and is faster, though less accurate if the index is not up to date
2008-02-16T14:53:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	thats what I was looking for! u already did sudo updatedb
2008-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	i don't know how to make that one case insensitive, check man locate
2008-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	FluxD		thx prince_jammys
2008-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	 locate -i
2008-02-16T14:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	FluxD	locate -i mysql <--- * not necessary here
2008-02-16T14:56:00.000Z	FluxD	prince_jammys	got it thanks that worked
