2007-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		MasterOfDsaster: I have 1 GB of RAM, 200 at most is used out of that, 2 GB of swap is empty, yet ubuntu still keeps reading from HD all the time.
2007-09-02T06:47:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		MasterOfDsaster: There's about 0.3 to 2 second delay for most operations, and it may not sound like a lot but when everything happens half a second late it gets kind of annoying.
2007-09-02T06:47:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		MasterOfDsaster: Plus boot takes over a minute, I'm not sure why. I used to boot in 20 seconds, even with this installation about 3 days ago.
2007-09-02T06:48:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		MasterOfDsaster: So maybe I've accidentally enabled some super economical memory use feature or slowed my computer down somehow? I'm really quite confused.
2007-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	hard disk DMA, or grapics acceleration
2007-09-02T06:56:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	MasterOfDisaster: check the nvidia graphics driver is installed, could be lack of graphics acceleration
2007-09-02T06:57:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	I have an "nvidia accelerated graphics driver" that is in use.
2007-09-02T06:58:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	ok, also check there is a swap partition and its size
2007-09-02T06:59:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	I have 2 GB swap partition, 0 bytes of it used.
2007-09-02T07:06:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	try running "top" in a terminal window and checking if any process is using a high PU
2007-09-02T07:07:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	CPU sorry
2007-09-02T07:09:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	wtf? why did you recompile synaptic?
2007-09-02T07:20:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	use "top" first
2007-09-02T07:21:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	The process manager? Everything looks fine to me. The CPU's at about 1% occasionally jumping to 5%.
2007-09-02T07:22:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	of my 1GB memory about 360mb is full.
2007-09-02T07:23:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	ok, that sounds good. Could you please list all the symptoms you see of the slowness you are talking about (except booting)?
2007-09-02T07:24:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	Right clicking something on the desktop makes the laptop read from HDD for about 2 seconds, even after that it still takes from half a second to one to display the same right click menu. Switching between windows is slow, again 05 to 2 seconds, sometimes I can actually see the window being drawn.
2007-09-02T07:26:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	Also when I click the menus on top ofthe screen they can take anywhere from 1 to 4 seconds to finish loading the icons.
2007-09-02T07:27:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	Again, the submenus themselves appear after about a second... I'd expect that at least to be instantaneous.
2007-09-02T07:28:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	By the way, the reason I mention netbeans is that my 8 month old windows xp installation on a much older desktop pc which takes several minutes to start up alone runs the program much faster.
2007-09-02T07:32:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	Does anything sound familiar at all?
2007-09-02T07:32:00.000Z	akf3478	Ar-Pharazon	last last line was for you
2007-09-02T07:32:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	akf3478	ok
