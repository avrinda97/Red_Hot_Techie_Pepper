2009-05-18T18:46:00.000Z	spaiduhz		what appears to be the problem?
2009-05-18T18:47:00.000Z	spaiduhz		i am guessing your installer cd is damaged. try to do a cd check before installing?
2009-05-18T18:48:00.000Z	spaiduhz		ah. are you trying to install via wubi?
2009-05-18T18:48:00.000Z	spaiduhz		ie, ubuntu inside windows?
2009-05-18T18:49:00.000Z	spaiduhz		odd.
2009-05-18T18:51:00.000Z	spaiduhz		it could be that your cdrom drive has "issues" with the cd.
