2005-11-25T10:12:00.000Z	Eternalist		dont bitch on here about ati not releasing details so that open source devs can properly write the drivers

2005-11-25T10:15:00.000Z	Eternalist		great now all my windows on the taskbar are bunched to one side because volume control is somewhere there andi cant see it.

2005-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	drag and drop them to a proper place on the panel (use rightklick the icons)
2005-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	thanks i think that did the trick
2005-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	yw ;)
2005-11-25T10:21:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	wait that didnt work, voluem control is still invisible.
2005-11-25T10:22:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	insert the notification applet in the panel
2005-11-25T10:22:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	;p
2005-11-25T10:26:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	lol sorry to bother you man, but it still doesnt work.
2005-11-25T10:27:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	its really really thin, so i have to click up and down the bar to find the volume control and i went to preferences but theres nothing about icnreasing the size
2005-11-25T10:28:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	try another theme perhaps its locked due to an upgrade
2005-11-25T10:29:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	yeah i tried another theme and it worked..so whats the deal then? i cant have my other theme anymore!?
2005-11-25T10:30:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	or should i reinstall the theme, its a default one its called amaranth
2005-11-25T10:30:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	amaranth seems to lack the icon then :(
2005-11-25T10:30:00.000Z	Eternalist	deFrysk	can i copy the icon from another theme?
2005-11-25T10:31:00.000Z	deFrysk	Eternalist	try to reinstall gnome-themes-extras and see it amaranth takes then
