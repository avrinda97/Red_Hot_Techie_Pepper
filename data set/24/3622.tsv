2008-02-29T22:59:00.000Z	yaro		drX: My experiences with LILO have invariably been bad.
2008-02-29T22:59:00.000Z	yaro		drX: Why not just use GRUB?
2008-02-29T22:59:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	I don't know what I have, is there any ez way to check?
2008-02-29T23:00:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Just take a look on Synaptic, by default Ubuntu uses GRUB.
2008-02-29T23:00:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Let me simplify that.
2008-02-29T23:01:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Have you every changed from the default at all?
2008-02-29T23:01:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	no
2008-02-29T23:02:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	recover a hosed Ubuntu drive after a failed update
2008-02-29T23:02:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	To repair GRUB, follow these directions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2008-02-29T23:03:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	 is Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition likely fixed by repairing GRUB?
2008-02-29T23:03:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Yis
2008-02-29T23:04:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	even tho grub comes up on the hard drive and still boots Vista?
2008-02-29T23:05:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Yep. Because when you tell GRUB to do the things on that HOWOT, it will repair the menu.lst and get things to work.
2008-02-29T23:05:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	and it won't hose Windows?
2008-02-29T23:05:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	You might have to manually add Vista back onto the menu.lst, but that's easy.
2008-02-29T23:06:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	ok, here's goes nothing...
2008-02-29T23:11:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	I did all the steps and result is the same:  "Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition"
2008-02-29T23:12:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	Something goofy in your fstab?
2008-02-29T23:14:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	1: root (hd1,0)  2: kernel /bootvmlinuz-2.6.17-12-generic root=/dev/sdb1 ro quite splas->  3: initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-12-generic  4: quiet   5: savedefault   6:  boot
2008-02-29T23:17:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	If all else fails, I would.
2008-02-29T23:18:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	do you think the Ubuntu 7.10 CD will retain my prior Ubuntu 6.06 programs & settings?
2008-02-29T23:18:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	don't think so. I suggest doing a backup.
2008-02-29T23:19:00.000Z	DrX	yaro	 and what does Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition mean?
2008-02-29T23:19:00.000Z	yaro	DrX	I think that there's some parameters wrong in your fstab. But I'm not too familiar with manually altering it.
