2010-08-20T14:05:00.000Z	crekarasu		I accidentally closed sshd. how can I restart it?
2010-08-20T14:06:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	/etc/init.d/ssh start (as root)
2010-08-20T14:08:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	I came home but refused connection on port 22 everything I see
2010-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	what do you mean with "I came home"?
2010-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	start sshd but I made all my connection is refused on port 22
2010-08-20T14:10:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	maybe your sshd doesn't listen to your port or it isn't running
2010-08-20T14:11:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	have you once changed the sshd settings?
2010-08-20T14:11:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	and what can I do?
2010-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, you should see what port sshd is listening to
2010-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	somewhere on line 5...
2010-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	tank you ! i can change it ?
2010-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	as root, yes
2010-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	what number was there?
2010-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	^^ yeah, well then it was obvious it wouldn't work
2010-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	after editing and saving, you'll have to restart the daemon
2010-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	reboot linux ? or what restart ?
2010-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	nonono -> /etc/init.d/ssh restart

2010-08-20T14:16:00.000Z	crekarasu	ixh	modify the port
2010-08-20T14:17:00.000Z	ixh	crekarasu	ah, ok - you will have to edit the file as root
