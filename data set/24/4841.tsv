2006-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Ramosa		why do I keep getting a "dpkg --configure -a" error when running automatic updates?
2006-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Ramosa		then it just hangs when I do that
2006-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Ramosa		dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a
2006-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	Ramosa		help!
2006-12-31T06:09:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	did you run dpkg --configure -a ?
2006-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	Ramosa	tim167	clearing /var/lib/dpkg/updates seemed to do the trick
2006-12-31T06:13:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	neat :-)
2006-12-31T06:38:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	Does Grub try to load the correct partition ?
2006-12-31T06:38:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	can you interrupt grub on startup ?
2006-12-31T06:39:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	by pressing escape when it shows Grub loading stage 1 (something like that )
2006-12-31T06:43:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	but I remember vaguely having had a similar situation and it appeared to be a newer kernel I installed but didn't work, I could launch into the older one this way
2006-12-31T06:43:00.000Z	Ramosa	tim167	but that doesn't help me when I am into Ubuntu and keep stalling
2006-12-31T06:43:00.000Z	Ramosa	tim167	it can't complete an update without stalling
2006-12-31T06:44:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	: is it necessary that you update ?
2006-12-31T06:45:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	I don't do updates unless I have a reason, not anymore that is, I had problems with updating the kernel just because update notifier sayd I should, now back on older kernel and everything fine :-)
2006-12-31T07:12:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	what kernel are you running ? does it end with -33 or -34 ?
2006-12-31T07:14:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	open Synaptic and look for  linux-image
2006-12-31T07:17:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	I'm just guessing, but, I downgraded from -34 to -33 because i had problems
2006-12-31T07:18:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	: You can downgrade the kernel with synaptic, but again, that's what worked for me
2006-12-31T07:20:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	I know what you mean, I've had that too sometimes, but I'm glad I didnt go back to windoze yet...
2006-12-31T07:22:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	i hope you use an floss os for more than just it being 'free' as in price
2006-12-31T07:24:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	then go ahead and eat the food without being allowed to see the ingredients :p
2006-12-31T07:25:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	yeah??, like what ? ;-)
2006-12-31T07:26:00.000Z	tim167	Ramosa	that's short term thinking
