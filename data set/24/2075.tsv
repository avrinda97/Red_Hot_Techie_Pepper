2010-06-17T15:17:00.000Z	anodesni		Hi, how can I change the font size of QT apps?
2010-06-17T15:17:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	install qt4-gui
2010-06-17T15:18:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	I can only find  libqt4-gui
2010-06-17T15:18:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	wait 1 sec
2010-06-17T15:19:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	ya that one
2010-06-17T15:21:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	then from menu you can run it and it will do it
2010-06-17T15:22:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	i used it once for skype
2010-06-17T15:22:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	which menu?
2010-06-17T15:22:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	main ubuntu menu > utilities
2010-06-17T15:22:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	or programming
2010-06-17T15:23:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	no, it's not there, not even in alacarte. Are you sure it was "libqt4-gui"?
2010-06-17T15:23:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	ok wait i check
2010-06-17T15:24:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	I think it's qt4-config
2010-06-17T15:25:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	hmm yes i think but i found a qt4-gui
2010-06-17T15:25:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	ah yes qt4-qtconfig
2010-06-17T15:26:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	but thanks
2010-06-17T15:26:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	so you need for q3 then use qt3-qtconfig
2010-06-17T15:30:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	unfortunately qtconfig does not remember the font  settings, any idea...
2010-06-17T15:30:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	it will if you select save from file menu
2010-06-17T15:30:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	I did
2010-06-17T15:31:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	because you need to close it to save it i think, its quite bad application
2010-06-17T15:31:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	no, sorry still not working, isn't there a .qt file?
2010-06-17T15:32:00.000Z	indus	anodesni	which app are you configureing
2010-06-17T15:32:00.000Z	anodesni	indus	texmaker
