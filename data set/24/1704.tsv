2010-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	r15		i have a laptop, only with one partition and one recovery partition
2010-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	r15		i want to install ubuntu on it,
2010-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	r15		basically, could you please tell me some tool to compress existing 99GB partition and make free space to make it dual boot?
2010-02-07T11:31:00.000Z	koshari	r15	is the partition full?
2010-02-07T11:31:00.000Z	r15	koshari	no i have plenty of free space on C drive
2010-02-07T11:32:00.000Z	koshari	r15	therefore you want gparted, as always back up any omportant data before using partitioning tools
2010-02-07T11:33:00.000Z	koshari	r15	you will need to run it from a live session
2010-02-07T11:34:00.000Z	r15	koshari	rightnow i am from a live ubuntu dvd itself
2010-02-07T11:34:00.000Z	koshari	r15	system > admin partition editor
2010-02-07T11:34:00.000Z	koshari	r15	system > admin > partition editor

2010-02-07T11:55:00.000Z	koshari	r15	you dont have windows using a dynamic partition do you?

2010-02-07T11:57:00.000Z	koshari	r15	iam guessing windows is using a dynamic partition, what version of windows?
2010-02-07T11:58:00.000Z	r15	koshari	it's widows xp
2010-02-07T11:58:00.000Z	koshari	r15	winxp didnt use dynamic partitions so that gues is scuttled,
2010-02-07T11:58:00.000Z	koshari	r15	try doing a disk defrag in windows and empty recycle bin , temp dirs before so
2010-02-07T11:59:00.000Z	koshari	r15	sometheings telling gparted its using all the space
