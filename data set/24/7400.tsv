2005-01-28T15:24:00.000Z	daniels		(for reference, I'm working on packaging the new fglrx drivers.)
2005-01-28T15:25:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	hmmm... so they could be integrated in linux-restricted-modules ?
2005-01-28T15:26:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	the spiyes means yes to my question ?
2005-01-28T15:26:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	how long do you think this will take you ?
2005-01-28T15:26:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	yah
2005-01-28T15:26:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	I hope you'll manage :-)
2005-01-28T15:26:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	not too long.  it was already packaged, but they thoughtfully rebuilt the rpms, so my dsl is just choking on the new packages now.
2005-01-28T15:27:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	ok... they are quite boring :-)
2005-01-28T15:28:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	and once it will be packaged... I don't know very well the package release system... But will it soon become apt-get -u dist-upgradable ?
2005-01-28T15:30:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	yeah
2005-01-28T15:30:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	nice :-) With any hope I'll soon be able to play tuxracer again :-)
2005-01-28T16:04:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	does it work ?
2005-01-28T16:10:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	yeah, it's been working during the week, but they just released a new build last night
2005-01-28T16:10:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	so my connection's been choking on it
2005-01-28T16:10:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	all right... With all ogra told about you, I'm sure you'll handle it :-)
2005-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	it's, er, already there
2005-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	hmmm... I was not speaking about release m74, but about beta version...
2005-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	is it really in hoary ?
2005-03-17T07:04:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	ooo2 is in hoary, yes
2005-03-17T07:05:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	the beta2, really, not just the testing 74 release ?
2005-03-17T07:06:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	so what is the name of the package in this case ?
2005-03-17T07:06:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	I just found the testing 74 release
2005-03-17T07:07:00.000Z	daniels	spiral	ah, I don't know.  if it's just testing 74 or whatever, then it hasn't been updated yet
2005-03-17T07:07:00.000Z	spiral	daniels	all right, so I hope it will be updated :-)
