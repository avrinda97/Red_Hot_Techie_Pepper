2010-02-28T04:40:00.000Z	bun_bun		no good. it still takes me to a command line
2010-02-28T04:40:00.000Z	bun_bun		One error says "acpi:LNXVIDEO: unexpected exit with s tatus 0x009
2010-02-28T04:41:00.000Z	bun_bun		heheh, I hit escape ... trying again.  :)
2010-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	bun_bun		trying
2010-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	bun_bun		will that change remain in the grub settings?
2010-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	bun_bun		or will I have to set it every time?
2010-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	bun_bun		(it's an old lady using the box)
2010-02-28T04:43:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	you edit /etc/default/grub  with your custom command-line options and then run update-grub2
2010-02-28T04:43:00.000Z	bun_bun		ok - that's what I had trouble with before. where exactly in grub.cfg do I add the line?
2010-02-28T04:43:00.000Z	bun_bun		I've already nano'd it and tried
2010-02-28T04:44:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	or better yet, 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc'
2010-02-28T04:44:00.000Z	bun_bun	kla	Typos_King: do I edit boot/grub/grub.cfg or /etc/default/grub ?
2010-02-28T04:44:00.000Z	bun_bun		heheh, please slow down :)
2010-02-28T04:44:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	I think you're better off with the dpkg-reconfigure command
2010-02-28T04:45:00.000Z	kla		!language | Cristobal
2010-02-28T04:45:00.000Z	bun_bun		ok, just sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc ?
2010-02-28T04:45:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	right, run that from a terminal
2010-02-28T04:45:00.000Z	bun_bun		running now. stand by
2010-02-28T04:46:00.000Z	kla		!sound | nitrate_
2010-02-28T04:47:00.000Z	bun_bun		after I run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc it's asking me now for a "Linux command line"
2010-02-28T04:47:00.000Z	bun_bun		what do I type there?
2010-02-28T04:48:00.000Z	bun_bun	kla	did I need to change something in /etc/ before the dpkg command?
2010-02-28T04:49:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	nope no changing anything, put the options on the second prompt no the first
2010-02-28T04:49:00.000Z	kla	bun_bun	leave first dialog as is, click next, enter options, click next, select drive(s), click ok.. wait.. reboot. done
