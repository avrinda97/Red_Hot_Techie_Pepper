2007-06-16T10:50:00.000Z	Live	stefg	can you help me with GParted installing ubuntu, i have no clue for this part
2007-06-16T10:52:00.000Z	stefg	Live	if you have currently just one big ntfs partition for the whole drive, it's more advisable to a.) backup everything b.) use a windows tool to resize the win partition and leave around 10 GB min. free, unpartitioned space. then run the installer again
2007-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	Live	stefg	http://img458.imageshack.us/img458/6793/screenshotdevsdagparteden4.png is what i have, its not just one
2007-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	stefg	Live	i see... gParted is slow and unreliable at resizing ntfs. But what about that empty /dev/sda5 can you just delete it?
2007-06-16T10:55:00.000Z	Live	stefg	there is obviously nothing important on it, am i right?
2007-06-16T10:56:00.000Z	stefg	Live	yeah, looks completly empty
2007-06-16T10:56:00.000Z	Live	stefg	is that a subdivision of /dev/sda3
2007-06-16T10:56:00.000Z	Live		?
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	stefg	Live	sda3 is a so-called extended partition. this is a workaround to the fact that old MSDOS part-tables can only have 4 primary partitions. So sda3 is just a container, which can hold other partitions
2007-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	stefg	Live	so if you _know_ that sda5 is empty you can just delete it, and use the free space for your ubuntu-install
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	Live	stefg	judging on the screenshot i have you, do you think that C: and D: on my windows space, are the top two partitions, or other?
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	stefg	Live	in win-speak the sda5 would be E:
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	Live	stefg	so the top two are my windows C: and D: ?
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	stefg	Live	yes
2007-06-16T11:01:00.000Z	Live	stefg	ok, i hope to god this doesn't touch my windows now, when i use sda5 :)
2007-06-16T11:01:00.000Z	Live		just hope for the best
2007-06-16T11:02:00.000Z	stefg	Live	i can't tell... whatever was drive E: in win will then be gone. but just the other two will be left untouched
2007-06-16T11:02:00.000Z	Live	stefg	I don't see a E: in Win, just in my computer I have C: and D: in windows
2007-06-16T11:02:00.000Z	Live		Is it hidden?
2007-06-16T11:03:00.000Z	stefg	Live	yeah, could be hidden or not assigned... whatever, it's the perfect palce to be used by shiny new ubuntu-install
2007-06-16T11:03:00.000Z	stefg	Live	so I#m 99.9% sure that it's safe to just delete it
2007-06-16T11:04:00.000Z	Live	stefg	i think it may be my recover partition?
2007-06-16T11:05:00.000Z	stefg	Live	yeah that's likely... but it /looks/ empty. But who knows which proprietary special format this is
