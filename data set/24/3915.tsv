2012-06-13T02:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	With avconv/ffmpeg you should be able to make a new file/container containing the original video stream and the new audio stream (no transcoding required).
2012-06-13T02:25:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	avconv is quite hard to use, i've tried but probably wrong way :/
2012-06-13T02:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	Try asking in #libav. While avconv is hard to use, it's also very good at doing things like this.
2012-06-13T02:30:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	no doubt on it :) #libav ok thx
2012-06-13T02:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	You're welcome.
2012-06-13T02:31:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	just found Transmageddon maybe it will help, who knows lol
2012-06-13T02:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	The main thing to know is that this should be entirely possible without any transcoding of the video.
2012-06-13T02:36:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	hell yes because you know transcoding what is transcoded is just bad... But i can't find any way on Linux to edit .WebM files for removing audio noise.
2012-06-13T02:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	I can't confirm these instructions myself other than to say that they seem sound, and if they work there is definitely no transcoding of video involved: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqe7uuXK8dk
2012-06-13T02:54:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	The video tutorial you given to me works :) Thanks very much :D
2012-06-13T02:55:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	please last question : Do you know to create .SH Script ? I would like to re-use the same syntax forever and call a .SH to do the job.
2012-06-13T02:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	You're welcome. You might want to be sure that the audio track actually was transcoded to vorbis though because 1: I'm not sure that WAV should really be used in webm and 2: WAV files are huge, transcoding to vorbis would save space without noticeable loss of quality.
2012-06-13T02:57:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	Yes i have exported to OGG Quality 10 and imported back to the video and it works fine :)
2012-06-13T02:59:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	now i'd like to re-use same command forever but by calling 2 variables like conv.sh file1 file2
2012-06-13T03:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	This is a very good guide for learning bash http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide
2012-06-13T03:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	Please pastebin the script you created so that I can check for common pitfalls (like failing to use quotes around variables).
2012-06-13T03:07:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	hahaha wonderfull it works fine, awesome :)
2012-06-13T03:09:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/xFt7YZDe Here you are, checkout, very easy :P
2012-06-13T03:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	That script will fail if either of the input filenames contain spaces. Here is a fixed version: http://pastebin.com/2U4qAVQP
2012-06-13T03:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	Correct. And I still recommend http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments above any other bash guides. There are a *lot* of bad bash guides out there.
2012-06-13T03:13:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	For my learning i would need French guide, in fact to succeed i use my old knowledges of MS-DOS, instead of $1 its %1 and in Basic its $A :)
2012-06-13T03:14:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	but i assume you are not French :P
2012-06-13T03:17:00.000Z	ChTiPowA	Jordan_U	to finalize that victory i will try now to upload the video sample before to confirm that works fine :)
2012-08-20T03:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ChTiPowA	fg has nothing to do with bringing a GUI application to the foreground.
