2012-08-12T03:22:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	How's it going?
2012-08-12T03:22:00.000Z	DanS		W4ps: Not sure yet.  About to try it.
2012-08-12T03:29:00.000Z	DanS		W4ps: Can you explain the chmod bit?  Changing it to 0664 comes up invalid mode.  I thought that was just three numbers for permissions?
2012-08-12T03:31:00.000Z	DanS		Oh.. nevermind i'm being stupid.
2012-08-12T03:32:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	If it doesnt use chmod 644 /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-08-12T03:32:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	You need sudo preceeding the commands I gave you.
2012-08-12T03:32:00.000Z	DanS		Yeah, i was doing it the other way around.  Just Me being silly.
2012-08-12T03:33:00.000Z	DanS		okay.. so with the conf in place.. should i just need to restart for it to take effect?
2012-08-12T03:35:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	That's the easiest way. One more thing... If the xorg.conf has flaws X may not come up. If that happens press the SHIFT key during start up and get to the shell. rename the xorg.conf.
2012-08-12T03:41:00.000Z	DanS	W4sp	Everything came up alright. But the thing I was trying didn't seem to work.
2012-08-12T03:42:00.000Z	DanS		So i'm not really even sure if it's using that xorg.conf.
2012-08-12T03:42:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	What has been suggested to you?
2012-08-12T03:43:00.000Z	DanS		I'm trying to get a touch screen monitor connected.
2012-08-12T03:43:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	OK, shouldn't be a problem. Where did you get the information from?
2012-08-12T03:44:00.000Z	DanS		It connects via serial > usb port.  I was trying this after attempts in a different way failed: http://conan.de/touchscreen/evtouch.html
2012-08-12T03:44:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	evtouch...? Itns't that outdated?
2012-08-12T03:45:00.000Z	DanS		Very possibly! It's more just what I tried earlier didn't work so I thought I'd try a different technique.
2012-08-12T03:46:00.000Z	DanS		Okay thanks, I'll look that up, and join that channel.  Didn't even think there'd be a specific channel for it.
2012-08-12T03:46:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	Forget evtouch. That's not going to do for you.
2012-08-12T03:46:00.000Z	DanS		Alright.  The monitor here is as old as the hills though.
2012-08-12T03:47:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	That doesn't matter because your OS is new. I suggest you circumvent evtouch as far as possible.
2012-08-12T03:48:00.000Z	DanS		I shall do just that then.  I'll remove anything I've changed so far then. to keep it clean. Thanks the advice.
2012-08-12T03:49:00.000Z	W4sp	DanS	Very welcome. You 'original' settings are in your home directory, just in case.
