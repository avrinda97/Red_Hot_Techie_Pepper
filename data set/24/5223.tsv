2006-09-27T07:48:00.000Z	eugman		Jay_levitt, so do you think one of the two versioning systems would be the best solution to what I want?
2006-09-27T07:49:00.000Z	eugman		!patience
2006-09-27T07:51:00.000Z	eugman		Does someone know of a system simpler than cvs/svn for tracking changes in a singles or few files?
2006-09-27T07:52:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	hold on i do know of one
2006-09-27T07:57:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	still looking have no fear
2006-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	really stlill looking just not having luck
2006-09-27T08:04:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	how bout git?
2006-09-27T08:04:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	http://www.darcs.net/
2006-09-27T08:05:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	that's the one that i was thinking of
2006-09-27T08:06:00.000Z	eugman	Bryce	looks interesting. What's different about it?
2006-09-27T08:08:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	it's simple and powerful
2006-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	i've have much less trouble with that htan cvs
2006-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	and it's still pretty powerfull
2006-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	eugman	Bryce	ok cool. I'll try it out this week.
2006-09-27T08:11:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	also if you feel intrepid try out searchign "revision control" (without the quotes of course) in synaptic and that'll show you all the ones in the apt repository which wll make installation a snap
2006-09-27T08:13:00.000Z	eugman	Bryce	so anythere where I keep track of changes to files would fall under the category of revision control, correct?
2006-09-27T08:13:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	yup i'd assume so, i dunno why not
2006-09-27T08:14:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	heh, well anything with different versions... that you track....woudl be revision control
2006-09-27T08:15:00.000Z	eugman	Bryce	Well I could imagine that it could have a specific meaning like projects able to manage large projects why some sort of more tangential program would have some other definition.
2006-09-27T08:16:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	no no it wasnt you, i was just thinking and well... it seems like the kind of thing that would have about a thousand crazy names
2006-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	i wasn't trying to be an ass, i was just confusing myself by overthinking it because it just seems ambiguious
2006-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	 no offence was meant
2006-09-27T08:18:00.000Z	eugman	Bryce	None was taken I was just trying to show that from my point of view things don't seems that simple. Unfortunately they aren't always as simple as they should be with linux.
2006-09-27T08:19:00.000Z	Bryce	eugman	yeah i know exactly what you mean. Like the fact that there's a million ways to say and do things is great.....but that's also a big pain in the ass too
