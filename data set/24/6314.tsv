2005-11-29T08:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Red-Sox	 is it a gmail issue or an ubuntu issue?
2005-11-30T08:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Red-Sox	 im assuming you installed kubuntu-desktop on you ubuntu
2005-12-06T16:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Red-Sox	if you ordered outside of the packaged packages than they have to approve your order first
2005-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Red-Sox	thats why
2005-12-06T16:08:00.000Z	Red-Sox	gnomefreak	i canceled it, i dont REALLY need it too bad, how many fits for it not to have to be approved?
2005-12-06T16:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Red-Sox	there is a drop down with packages already set pick one
