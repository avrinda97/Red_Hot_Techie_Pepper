2008-10-15T06:39:00.000Z	mroc		still hanging around looking for an answer to the following:  is it at all possible for ubuntu to have caused the following error in a drive utility "Uncorrectable data error or media is write protected" ?
2008-10-15T06:40:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	is it a NTFS drive?
2008-10-15T06:41:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	it's a drive with an ntfs partition, a small fat partition, and unpartitioned space (deleted ubuntu partition)
2008-10-15T06:41:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	and none of the partitions appear?
2008-10-15T06:42:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	well, since i deleted the ubuntu partition (don't ask...) it's not bootable.  but the drive won't mount in a live cd, and the installer seems to go into some infinite loop at loading the partitioner
2008-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	it's a good live cd...this happens with both 8.04 and 8.10 daily image
2008-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	tried booting in windows (if you can) and then shutting restarting your comp?
2008-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	there's an issue with NTFS drives when they weren't properly shut down afaik
2008-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	forgive me if this is a dumb question, but how would i go about booting into windows?  grub took over as the bootloader, and the linux partition was deleted
2008-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	do you have access to a CD burner? if yes, create a supergrub CD
2008-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	i do.  i've never heard of that.  any more info, or should i google it and learn on my own?
2008-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	one sec..  looking for the url
2008-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	thanks.  i can dig it up if needed.
2008-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2008-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	you shouldbe able to reboot windows using that
2008-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	if you have it on one of your drive
2008-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	i'll look into it.  windows still exists, i could see it using the recovery console on a windows disk.  i was just concerned about running fixmbr if there was a mechanical problem with the disk causing these errors.
2008-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	yep. I understand that. Thus supergrub. it doesn't install anything. It just bypasses your disks bootloaders and so on
2008-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	one of the must-have boot cds ;)
2008-10-15T06:50:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	thanks for the help, it's very much appreciated.  i'll probably try to find you again if i run into questions (if that's all right).
2008-10-15T06:51:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	well . I'm not a regular here ;) I only come whenever I have a uestion/problem .. and then I usually end up helping where I can
2008-10-15T06:51:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	but you're welcome :)
2008-10-15T06:51:00.000Z	mroc	sammyF	ah, i see.  i do the same thing.
2008-10-15T06:52:00.000Z	sammyF	mroc	yep. astounding, but the system seems to work. So far I've always received quite usefull help, and I hopefully gave some
