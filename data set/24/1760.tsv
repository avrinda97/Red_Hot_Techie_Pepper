2009-09-06T02:33:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	same issue... is there somewhere else i have to change the kernel besides menu.lst?
2009-09-06T02:34:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	remove /boot from the kernel line
2009-09-06T02:34:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	I did.
2009-09-06T02:34:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	should I try it with boot...?
2009-09-06T02:34:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	I saw that to so I removed boot from the line.
2009-09-06T02:35:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	not sure what to say, what error is grub giving you?
2009-09-06T02:36:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	No idea, im doing this with VM so unless its logging the errors..?
2009-09-06T02:36:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	usually I wouldn't but I have my server elsewhere in my house.
2009-09-06T02:36:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	and only one keyboard and mouse set
2009-09-06T02:38:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	how do you know that it isn't working then, does it just not boot?
2009-09-06T02:38:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	uname -a reports a different version number - the generic kernel on the list.
2009-09-06T02:40:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	what kernel source did you download?
2009-09-06T02:40:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	http://wiki.fragaholics.de/index.php/EN:Linux_Kernel_Optimization
2009-09-06T02:40:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	so the ones listed there in wget
2009-09-06T02:40:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	linux-2.6.26.8
2009-09-06T02:40:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	with a patch.
2009-09-06T02:44:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	it is probably the correct kernel, but you didn't change the version string in one of the files in the kernel source folder
2009-09-06T02:44:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	I don't have a kernel source at the moment, and the name of the file escapes me
2009-09-06T02:45:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	I don't think its loading the correct kernel... you might be right, but I'm not sure.
2009-09-06T02:45:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	thanks for taking your time and helping out though, not sure whats wrong here myself
2009-09-06T02:45:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	I think I might need to set the kernel somewhere else as wwell.
2009-09-06T02:45:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	well*
2009-09-06T02:51:00.000Z	trism	Guest79755	got a kernel source, the version string is configured in the Makefile at the root of the kernel source folder, that is the version info that it printed in uname -a, I would check that, perhaps add some extra info (like -custom) to EXTRAVERSION and then rebuild the kernel and try that
2009-09-06T03:14:00.000Z	Guest79755	trism	Is there any way I can confirm it is loading the correct kernel?
