2008-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	ArrowLance		i fell asleep
2008-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	ArrowLance		when i select ubuntu, i get error 15 stating the menu.lst can't be found. When i check on the files in windows, they are no longer there
2008-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	ArrowLance		yes
2008-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	is this the first time you rebooted?
2008-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	so it comes till the grub menu, lets you pick, and you get error 15 when you select ubuntu?
2008-05-13T10:18:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	you wont be able to see the ubuntu files from windows unless you have etx2fs
2008-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	wubi?
2008-05-13T10:21:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	ah
2008-05-13T10:21:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	the ubuntu file shrunk from 6 gb to 1.5 gb?
2008-05-13T10:22:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	then there is a good chance youve lost data. i dont know how it could have happened though
2008-05-13T10:24:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	its possible
2008-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	you could reinstall, but if its happened twice it will happen again
2008-05-13T10:27:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	if youve got an empty partition lying around i suggest a normal ubuntu install
2008-05-13T10:28:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	that is probably much more tolerant to unclean shutdowns and stuff
2008-05-13T10:31:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	the general overview is to first defrag the partition you want to resize, then reboot using the live cd, use gparted to resize the partiotion (i suggest atleast 10 gb, but ive used 6gb without any problem before) and then install as usual
2008-05-13T10:32:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	well, if you are feeling brave you dont need a blank cd.
2008-05-13T10:32:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	get the alternate install cd and use that. its much easier
2008-05-13T10:33:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows : CD ISO approach
2008-05-13T10:34:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	ArrowLance	just make sure you defrag the partition you are going to resize first. itÄºl make the resizing later signifincalty safer
