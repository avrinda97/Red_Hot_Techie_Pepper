2008-09-01T00:45:00.000Z	iamme		i need help with a resolution problem in Hardy
2008-09-01T00:45:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	what's the problem?
2008-09-01T00:46:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	it says the max resolution is 960x600, but it is at least 1024x768
2008-09-01T00:46:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	ive tried all the stuff at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto, and none of it worked
2008-09-01T00:46:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	what video driver are you using?
2008-09-01T00:47:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	the standard one for this card from lspci 'VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 65x/M650/740 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter '
2008-09-01T00:49:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	what video driver are you using in /etc/X11/xorg.conf for your video card?
2008-09-01T00:50:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	it doesnt say anything about drivers in the 'monitor' or 'screen' sections
2008-09-01T00:51:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	this is my xorg.conf
2008-09-01T00:51:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	what video card is in you machine?
2008-09-01T00:52:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	from lspci it appears to be a 'VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 65x/M650/740 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter '
2008-09-01T00:53:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	in the Device section, try adding   Driver  "sis"
2008-09-01T00:54:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	ok, brb
2008-09-01T00:59:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	i added that line in the 'Monitor' section, and upon restarting X, it gave me an 'Ubuntu Low Resolution Warning' message, and still didnt work, even when i selected 1024x768 as the resolution
2008-09-01T00:59:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	define "didn't work"
2008-09-01T01:00:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	it is still at 800x600, what it was before i tried that
2008-09-01T01:02:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	k.  to the xorg.conf, in the Screen section, add SubSection "Display <CR> Modes   "1024x768" <CR> EndSubSection    where each <CR> means hit the Enter key
2008-09-01T01:03:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	can you paste the lspci output for your vid card again, as well
2008-09-01T01:05:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	it appears that the low res warning config already added that
2008-09-01T01:05:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	ill reboot just to be sure
2008-09-01T01:05:00.000Z	bobernet	iamme	that's good.  did it also add BusID to the Device section for your card?
2008-09-01T01:10:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	it works!!!!!
2008-09-01T01:10:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	i guess adding the driver line messed it up, loading that utility, which made it work :P
2008-09-01T01:12:00.000Z	iamme	bobernet	well thanks
