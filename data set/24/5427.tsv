2006-08-19T09:15:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		hey everyone, how do i see my paths?
2006-08-19T09:16:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	from where, terminal?
2006-08-19T09:16:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		sure
2006-08-19T09:16:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		yeah, i'm trying to add a path
2006-08-19T09:17:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	you can display your current path with pwd
2006-08-19T09:17:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	and to make a new directory you do mkdir path/newdirname
2006-08-19T09:18:00.000Z	AMDfanboy	eternalswd	no not that kind of path ;-) - i'm trying to install ktorrent 2.0, i'm runing mepis.  it tells me that it cant find X in the path
2006-08-19T09:18:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	okay, so you need to add a path to the environment?
2006-08-19T09:18:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		it said this when i ran the ./configure file  ----   "checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X includes. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!"
2006-08-19T09:18:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		yea, thats what its called
2006-08-19T09:20:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		hmm? for X?
2006-08-19T09:20:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		i'm using mepis
2006-08-19T09:20:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		it comes with 1.2 which sucks, i'm trying to install 2.0 from source
2006-08-19T09:21:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		warbo: on apt there is only 1.2, not 2.0
2006-08-19T09:23:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		hmm, but i already have 1.2 installed, so i probably have the packages
2006-08-19T09:23:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		this is the error i get, "checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X includes. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!"
2006-08-19T09:23:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		i think its saying something else?
2006-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	just so you know, there's a precompiled deb at http://ktorrent.org/index.php?page=downloads
2006-08-19T09:26:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		ok, i ran that command, "apt-get build-dep ktorrent"
2006-08-19T09:26:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		it did stuff
2006-08-19T09:26:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		what did i do?  ;-)
2006-08-19T09:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	what you did was install the necessary libraries to compile ktorrent, now try rebuilding.
2006-08-19T09:28:00.000Z	AMDfanboy		it died in exactly the same place, "checking for X... configure: error: Can't find X includes. Please check your installation and add the correct paths!"
2006-08-19T09:28:00.000Z	eternalswd	AMDfanboy	if you can't get it to work, there's a precompiled deb at http://ktorrent.org/index.php?page=downloads
