2011-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r		Greetings.
2011-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r		Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS patched and up-to-date.  About 3 hours ago I stopped being able to create new processes.  Everything I try from the shell gives bash: /path/to/executable: Input/Output Error.  I can't even sudo -u root so that I could re-start the server.  The server is about 9,000 miles from me and I'd prefer to restart it ASAP rather than wait for the morning staff to come in, about 5 hours from now.  Can you recommend any actions?  Thanks in a
2011-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	look into /var/log/syslog - looks like a disk error
2011-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	I don't think I can even cat it.
2011-11-11T16:56:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	is it on elastic storage or discrete disk
2011-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	Physical disk.
2011-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	It may be some log that went crazy; single partition.
2011-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	ouch! time to go on the cloud?
2011-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	Do yhou know of some bash way of opening a file?  I don't think I can even run cat :(
2011-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	other than cat or less or more
2011-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	Hah!  Yeah.  And I'm a big cloud advocate.  This particular server is cheaper to run physically since the DC, power, air, and network are free :)
2011-11-11T17:00:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	I can start a new shell.  I can't start anything else.  And the web server is still sort of running.  Processes eventually lock up.
2011-11-11T17:00:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	That's consistent with running out of disk or file descriptors.
2011-11-11T17:01:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	The servrer gets huge traffic spikes occasionally; I'm guessing file descriptors before physical disk.  And you just gave me an idea.
2011-11-11T17:02:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	The user I'm using may be out of ulimit resources...  but maybe others are still OKi.
2011-11-11T17:02:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	thats a thought; can you become root?
2011-11-11T17:02:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	It's only that user :D
2011-11-11T17:03:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	I'm checking /group to see if anyh of my other user names there is in wheel.
2011-11-11T17:03:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	can you shutdown the web server? and then delete some apache logs?
2011-11-11T17:03:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	Yup, it's only that one user.
2011-11-11T17:03:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	I don't know.  I need to first figure out if I can sudo -u root :)  One moment.
2011-11-11T17:04:00.000Z	phlak_user	pr3d4t0r	just type sudo -i
2011-11-11T17:17:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	phlak_user	OKi, more information:  I can log on as a non-wheel user.  When I try to su as a user in the wheel group I get a Bus Error.
