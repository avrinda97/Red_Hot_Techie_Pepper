2009-10-13T08:30:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	GUI-IRCn00b	is it a headless one that has a webui?
2009-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		we run it as a headless server
2009-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		what you mean by headless ive no idea :/
2009-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		ahh
2009-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		then yes its headless

2009-10-13T08:31:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		www.torrentflux.com
2009-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	GUI-IRCn00b	well, this box is a CLI only box.  can you send me a howto to install it with the WebUI through GLI?
2009-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		u running 9.04 current ?
2009-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		transmission works too. flux has way more power IMHO
2009-10-13T08:32:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	GUI-IRCn00b	thanks.  as I said, we're using it to distro our indi films
2009-10-13T08:33:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b	jeeves_Moss	apt-get install torrentflux should do
2009-10-13T08:33:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	GUI-IRCn00b	thanks.
2009-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		i cant answer as a harcore user but i found the admin aspect more verbose
2009-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		so you can have "accounts" as to who can do what
2009-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		we have multiple users on it
2009-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	GUI-IRCn00b		so it worked best for our usage
2009-10-13T08:34:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	GUI-IRCn00b	I'm just looking for something simple so the girls in the office can just add the files
