2008-06-01T12:09:00.000Z	Bllz		anybody know why my smb shares don't show up in vista?
2008-06-01T12:10:00.000Z	Bllz		but iÄºl check
2008-06-01T12:11:00.000Z	Bllz		InvaderAmoto... how would I determine the ip?
2008-06-01T12:11:00.000Z	Bllz		sorry... i'm noobing hard today
2008-06-01T12:11:00.000Z	Bllz		oh you mean the file path, InvaderAmoto?
2008-06-01T12:12:00.000Z	Bllz		ooh. even better
2008-06-01T12:13:00.000Z	Bllz		InvaderAmoto... the computer name is the name of the Ubuntu box? or the name of the samba share?
2008-06-01T12:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	ubuntu box
2008-06-01T12:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	have you enabled printer and file sharing in the vista firewall?
2008-06-01T12:10:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 i believe so
2008-06-01T12:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	go to the machine with samba on it and type ifconfig into a terminal
2008-06-01T12:16:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 dumb question--how do i enable network and file sharing in Vista?
2008-06-01T12:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	it is a service that runs per default, if you use a non windows firewall you might need to open the port/service on the legacy firewall manually
2008-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 do you happen to know the services name as per services.msc ... I disabled a bunch a while ago
2008-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	as i didnt reherse those, i am sorry... but its name is something like file and printer sharing...
2008-06-01T12:19:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 okay thanks!  I think i can manage from here
2008-06-01T12:19:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	 no prob:)
2008-06-01T12:30:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 so I map a network drive as \\servername\sharename  ?
2008-06-01T12:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	heh glad i could help gg
2008-06-01T12:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	right
2008-06-01T12:39:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	+ InvaderAmoto:  how come it's not being accepted then?
2008-06-01T12:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	you need to login explicilta with that user otherwise you use your windows user;)
2008-06-01T12:41:00.000Z	Bllz	remoteCTRL	 not sure what you mean.  it prompts me for a username and pass... i give it the username/pass that i used to create it in ubuntu, and it's apparently not mapped to that user
2008-06-01T12:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Bllz	InvaderAmoto got a point in that, need to add the samba share to the workgroup to work properly...
