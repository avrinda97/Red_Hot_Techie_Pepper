2012-08-28T06:42:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	purged avg?
2012-08-28T06:46:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	u can boot ubuntu in recovery mode, drop to a root shell, then reinstall it to get back to your desktop
2012-08-28T06:47:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	then try to remove it again (try google for proper way to uninstall AVG on ubuntu)
2012-08-28T07:00:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	boot from live cd... or boot in "recovery mode" and drop to root shell
2012-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	cp /home/XXXX/Desktop /media/USB/ (or whatever ur USB is mounted as)
2012-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	i dont think u just want to backup your desktop.... u prob mean everything? the complete ubuntu
2012-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	what are u trying to backup/save?
2012-08-28T07:09:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	if your do just your Desktop... its only going to save your desktop icons and whatever is on your desktop
2012-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	umm, why are u backing everything up on a usb stick? i would just backup what u need/want like docs, pics, etc... then reinstall ubuntu fresh...
2012-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	just backup whatever u need... like documents, pictures, important stuff like that.... then do a fresh install of ubuntu
2012-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	why are u backing up a broken ubuntu to a usb stick?
2012-08-28T07:15:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	live cd is ubuntu iso burnt to a CD. u can boot up ubuntu in a live env from the CD
2012-08-28T07:15:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	that will give u a graphical desktop again... then u can mount your ubuntu partition and save whatever u want and also try to fix your problems
2012-08-28T07:17:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	google is your friend man... use it... esp if you are new to linux and trying to do stuff. google has millions of step by step howto guides with pictures and everything
2012-08-28T07:17:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	a lot easier than somebody tryin to type everything out on IRC
2012-08-28T07:19:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	google search ubuntu live cd recovery and u will find lots of howto guides on what you are trying to do
2012-08-28T07:20:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	it will not erase all your files... you are just booting from cd/usb... then you must mount the actual partition u installed ubuntu on... then u can make changes to it and/or fix it
2012-08-28T07:21:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	like i said, google ubuntu live cd recovery (use the same process even tho you are using live usb)
2012-08-28T07:21:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	backup important stuff like pics, docs, whatever... then format ur hard drive and do a fresh install of ubuntu
2012-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	ubuntu live cd recovery
2012-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CategoryBackupRecovery
2012-08-28T07:24:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode - then drop to root shell
2012-08-28T07:30:00.000Z	h22turbo	yam_	ur going to have to get use to using google and reading a lot. learning linux takes a long time and takes a lot of patients, a lot of reading, and following howto guides found on the internet
