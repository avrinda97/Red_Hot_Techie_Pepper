2006-12-11T07:07:00.000Z	cardanto1		hey there -- anyone who can answer a quick config question (gnome)
2006-12-11T07:09:00.000Z	cardanto1		i would like to be able to type in addresses in an "address bar" in the file manager -- can't figure out how to do it -- too much clicking! any thoughts?
2006-12-11T07:09:00.000Z	cardanto1		windows has a nice hybrid where i can click when i want and type in address locations as needed -- is this possible in ubuntu?
2006-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	engla	cardanto1	in edgy, just click the leftmost button
2006-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	cardanto1		o.k. so edit --> preferences
2006-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	engla	cardanto1	no on the adress toolbar
2006-12-11T07:10:00.000Z	engla		*address
2006-12-11T07:11:00.000Z	cardanto1		yeah -- i don't see it -- what check box is it? (i did look into this before asking :))
2006-12-11T07:11:00.000Z	cardanto1		2.6.15-27-server
2006-12-11T07:12:00.000Z	cardanto1		yes -- i believe it is dapper
2006-12-11T07:12:00.000Z	cardanto1		sorry guys, which panel, i can't get it to work
2006-12-11T07:13:00.000Z	cardanto1		got it
2006-12-11T07:13:00.000Z	cardanto1		config editor is up

2006-12-11T07:14:00.000Z	cardanto1		yes -- i have it
2006-12-11T07:15:00.000Z	cardanto1		o.k. so i have swapped out the path bar for a typed in location bar
2006-12-11T07:15:00.000Z	cardanto1		let me try that
2006-12-11T07:16:00.000Z	cardanto1		sweet it's there already . . . no restart required (For the program) how is that??
2006-12-11T07:17:00.000Z	cardanto1		o.k. jrib -- one more for you: any way to emulate "windows + D" to minimize everything with the click of a button?
2006-12-11T07:17:00.000Z	cardanto1		keyboard
2006-12-11T07:18:00.000Z	cardanto1		pronoob -- no, i like clicking and typing (otherwise i am hitting 'ls' like a mad-man)
2006-12-11T07:18:00.000Z	engla	cardanto1	ctrl-alt-D should be bound to that already no?
2006-12-11T07:18:00.000Z	cardanto1		o.k jrib will try
2006-12-11T07:19:00.000Z	cardanto1	engla	-- yep -- you got it!!! sweet!
