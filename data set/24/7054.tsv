2005-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	me too.
2005-05-16T10:51:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	bmp suffers from the same slow, skip to problem he wants to get rid of.  it's much more polished than xmms though.
2005-05-16T11:00:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	he's talking about his win partition
2005-05-16T11:22:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	they are the "point and click people" just like i am a "turn the key and drive guy (i know nothing about engines)"
2005-05-16T11:23:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	still, i bet you know how many litres
2005-05-16T11:25:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	this will take us to the vim vs emacs roadway
2005-05-16T11:25:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	the argument was a moot point ( i use neither)
2005-05-16T11:26:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	out of interest, what *do* you use?
2005-05-16T11:26:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	nano or abiword (for rtf)
2005-05-18T07:36:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	don't tell me you install dependencies from source as well...
2005-05-18T07:37:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	nope i cheat with build-dep
2005-05-18T07:58:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	multiple trash folders?!
2005-05-18T07:58:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	i have found 3 trash folders on my system
2005-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	i don't have a /root/.Trash
2005-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	you do if you sudo su first
2005-05-18T08:03:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	i only use sudo, never a su heh heh
2005-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	that's good.  i found that root trash folder in another distro actually when i deleted stuff as root.
2005-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	even when i ran YDL, i set up sudo
2005-05-18T08:05:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	you're right, which is why i said "that's good".
2005-05-18T09:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	its the long form of command
2005-05-18T09:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	there is gksu and gksudo both
2005-05-18T09:08:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	ubuntu doesnt use "su" so does not include gksu
2005-05-18T09:09:00.000Z	elcu	Nalioth	righto.  i tried to remove xlibmesa-gl via synaptic (cancelling of course) and it listed gksu but not gksudo
2005-05-18T09:09:00.000Z	Nalioth	elcu	funny how gksu is here, even tho ubuntu steers clear of 'su'
