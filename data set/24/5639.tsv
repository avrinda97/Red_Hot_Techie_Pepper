2007-09-08T08:54:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 ask in #compiz-fusion
2007-09-08T08:57:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 donT apologise for being new, as long as you learn we are happy
2007-09-08T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	they are updates , Ie new versions of the apps
2007-09-08T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 you only get updates for packages you have installedd
2007-09-08T09:05:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	look up your freind's model in this link see if any issues are known  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2007-09-08T09:06:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 you can edit xorg.conf to ad the extra resolutions you want to use and in menu <`system  > prefs > fonts , check subpixel hinting to make the fonts sharper
2007-09-08T09:08:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-11-26T07:22:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 tell here to unmount the mp3 player before she unplugs it and to empty the trashcan also
2007-11-26T07:22:00.000Z	brad_	Pelo	She does both.
2007-11-26T07:22:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	what model ?
2007-11-26T07:23:00.000Z	brad_	Pelo	Memorex Renew, 1gb.
2007-11-26T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 I don't know that one,  I had problems with my RCA ones that were similar,  I had to relaod the firmware before it would work properly again,  when she loads it up does she do it as a usb flash drive using nautilus or does she use a music app like amarok or rhythmbox ?
2007-11-26T07:25:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 the only thing I can suggest now is to look up themodel in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org
2007-11-26T07:25:00.000Z	brad_	Pelo	I was unaware amarok or rhythmbox could do that, I may have her try that since she is also having a problem with the id3 tags not being recognized by the player...
2007-11-26T07:26:00.000Z	brad_	Pelo	Yeah, I searched for it, couldn't find anything. thanks though.
2007-11-26T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	brad_	 I was gonna recommend doing it with nautilus anway
2007-11-26T07:26:00.000Z	brad_	Pelo	Ah, just found this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/158248
