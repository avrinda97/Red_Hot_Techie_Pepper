2012-06-06T06:43:00.000Z	jwcarman		crap, how do I do that?
2012-06-06T06:44:00.000Z	jwcarman		do I need to be root to create a boot disk/device?
2012-06-06T06:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Generally to burn a Boot CD, no, to create a Bootable USB drive, yes.
2012-06-06T06:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	We have a policy of not supporting EOL releases.
2012-06-06T06:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	End Of Life. Ubuntu 12.04 is certainly not EOL, but Ormie was talking about 7.04 which certainly is.
2012-06-06T06:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Can you use your keyboard in the BIOS menus (I'm trying to figure out why you aren't able to get the grub menu to show up).
2012-06-06T06:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	That's normal for Ubuntu, but holding shift (not just pressing it) during boot should normally get it to show up.
2012-06-06T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	I can tell you a dirty hack to get the grub menu to show, but my guess is that when it does you won't be able to interact with it (since if grub were able to get input from your keyboard at all, holding shift would have worked).
2012-06-06T07:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Again, I can tell you (an ugly) way to get the grub menu to show, but if you do it and grub can't get input from your keyboard you'll be stuck at the grub menu unable to boot Ubuntu anymore. Do you want to try that? Do you remember being able to use your keyboard with grub in the past?
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	jwcarman	Jordan_U	how do I change it back?
2012-06-06T07:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	That was what I was going to recommend as the ugly way to get it to appear, reboot and pull the plug on the computer immediately after Ubuntu starts to boot.
2012-06-06T07:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	That will be detected as a failed boot, and thus the grub menu will be shown.
2012-06-06T07:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	No.
2012-06-06T07:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	The way that it works is that grub sets a "recordfail" flag itself, then late in boot a script removes that flag (to indicate that booting was successful). Then if grub boots again, and sees that the flag is still there, it knows that booting failed.
2012-06-06T07:09:00.000Z	jwcarman	Jordan_U	cool.  That should be very helpful.  Nasty, but effective in this case
2012-06-06T07:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Unless you get stuck at the grub menu, yes :)
2012-06-06T07:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	If you're willing to try it though it sounds like it will probably work.
2012-06-06T07:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	No, don't edit /etc/sudoers at all.
2012-06-06T07:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Add your user to the "sudo" or "admin" group.
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Also, you shouldn't have changed the permissions of /etc/sudoers, they were like that for a reason.
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	chmod -w
2012-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	jwcarman	Jordan_U	what file do I change to add me to the group?
2012-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	jwcarman	Jordan_U	can I just modify the "group" file to add me to the end of the "sudo" group line?
2012-06-06T07:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman	Yes.
