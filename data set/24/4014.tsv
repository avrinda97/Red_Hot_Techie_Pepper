2007-08-06T07:21:00.000Z	atselby		can anyone help me fix my hibernate function? im on a feisty fawn, and a dell inspiron laptop. thanks.
2007-08-06T07:22:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	Did you buy an Inspiron pre-installed with Ubuntu?
2007-08-06T07:22:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	nope. loaded Ubuntu myself, with my uncles help, back with the LTS. ive since upgraded to edgy and then feisty. with feisty my hibernate broke, and ive only just decided to fix it. :P
2007-08-06T07:23:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	I had the same problem with my ThinkPad but there were specific packages for thinkpads that fixed it.
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	i just looked at the uswsusp package, from a topic on the forums, but it didnt do anything. did you use this or something else?
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	Look up "inspiron" in synaptic package manager.
2007-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	oaky
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	i8kutils is a package that's supposed to enable functions on Inspiron laptops.
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	okay. i've heard of that before.
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	And lphdisk is too.  You might want to play around with those packages.  :)
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	actually. its seems i have it installed.
2007-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	okay.
2007-08-06T07:28:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	with the i8kutils, do you know if thats in gkrellm? or a seperate thing?
2007-08-06T07:30:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	What's the model number for your Inspiron?
2007-08-06T07:30:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	8600
2007-08-06T07:31:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	DId you look at this:  http://www.len.ro/work/tools/from-gentoo-to-ubuntu-on-a-dell-i8600
2007-08-06T07:31:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	no hadnt seen that. leme see
2007-08-06T07:32:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	about suspend2 i would guess?
2007-08-06T07:33:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	the only thing is its not nvidia so... i dunno how thatd affect it
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	well nothing ive read so far seems ot have helped me... i dunno what can have caused hibernate to break between edgy and feisty. thanks for your help though.
2007-08-06T07:55:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	Sorry man.  My ThinkPad would never shut down properly.  Laptops are by design made for Windows except for a small handful.
2007-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	well see that to me is odd. it shuts down fine, reboots fine, and goes to suspend fine but just not hibernate... and the fact atht it worked before just make it more puzzling.
2007-08-06T07:56:00.000Z	mr_dude	atselby	Try searching around ubuntu forums for it or making your own post.
2007-08-06T07:57:00.000Z	atselby	mr_dude	yeah im going to keep searching around for something.. ive found some useful things on there before. thanks again.
