2009-03-21T19:44:00.000Z	lighttitan		Having problems with Nvidia drivers 180.29. Installed them, they worked GREAT. Did a system update, including kernel, and now when I try to reinstall them it causes lots of problems... any suggestions on how to wipe all the configs and start over with a fresh Nvidia install?
2009-03-21T19:45:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	what happens when you try to reinstall?
2009-03-21T19:46:00.000Z	lighttitan		when I try to reinstall, upon reboot I get a window telling me errors and X server won't start properly
2009-03-21T19:46:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	and are you reinstalling the drivers from a TTY with the gui stopped?
2009-03-21T19:47:00.000Z	lighttitan		yes I am
2009-03-21T19:47:00.000Z	lighttitan		when I reinstall from TTY it also gives me errors stating that drivers were installed another way and it will TRY to remove them as best as it can
2009-03-21T19:48:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	that's weird.. I've done that several times with no issues.. there is a way to uninstall the nvidia binary driver then try to reinstall again.. also make sure that all nvidia references in synaptic are NOT installed.
2009-03-21T19:50:00.000Z	lighttitan		Zzeiss... VESA drivers don't run 3D acceleration. So no games. Also I have had NO problems running NVidia drivers and can run them now if I want to go with 177... but I want some of the new improvements from 180.29... thanks for your concern though...
2009-03-21T19:50:00.000Z	lighttitan	scunizi	ok I guess I will just keep trying or go back to 177 drivers :( Thanks
2009-03-21T19:51:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	I had to uninstall 173 & 177 drivers from the system before installing the binary blob from nvidia.. otherwise I ended up with similar issues..
2009-03-21T19:51:00.000Z	lighttitan		AH... I will try that then/ Thanks scunizi
2009-03-21T19:51:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	also nvidia-settings needs to go
2009-03-21T19:51:00.000Z	lighttitan		ok thanks scunizi
2009-03-21T19:52:00.000Z	lighttitan	scunizi	"mark for complete removal" correct?
2009-03-21T19:52:00.000Z	scunizi	lighttitan	yes
2009-03-21T19:53:00.000Z	lighttitan	scunizi	k thanks again. Going to work on it more
