2009-09-15T09:50:00.000Z	Mushrooms		i plugged my wireless card in... and then booted ubuntu.. I don't think that it is working
2009-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	Mushrooms		anyone available to give me some advice on my wireless network card?
2009-09-15T09:51:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Mushrooms	get intel
2009-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	sorry? I don't understand what you mean
2009-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		intel network cards are very well supported
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	*sigh* i only wish someone told me that the otherday when i was asking which one i should buy
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	someone re-directed me to a ubuntu page listing some hardware compatibilities
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	then i cross check the one with good support
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	plug it in.. now don't know what to do with it
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Mushrooms	well as long as you don't have broadcom you're probably set too
2009-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	Mushrooms		i got a netgear
2009-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	Netgear WG311 Wireless PCI Card 802.11G (54Mbps)
2009-09-15T09:56:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Mushrooms	well if you have the proper drivers then you should be able to connect via it with a network manager (wicd is a good option) if you don't you will have to find out which ones you need and install them
2009-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	how do i check if i got the drivers? and that computer can not go on the internet at the moment.. any chance i can get it installed without a internet connection (via cd)
2009-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	i don't think it can connect at all, when i click on network manager it doesn't show a wireless connection
2009-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	only wired
2009-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		does it have an ethernet port?
2009-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		if so you can use that to install the drivers (as it sounds like you don't have them) or you could download them on another pc and transfer via usb, the install cd might have them, i dunno
2009-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	is there a way to issue a command to my ubuntu and ask for it to scan for new hardware?
2009-09-15T10:01:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Mushrooms	i don't know
2009-09-15T10:02:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	oh lol :(
2009-09-15T10:02:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Mushrooms	someone else might know...I'm not that familiar with ubuntu or gnome
2009-09-15T10:02:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi		or dpkg for that matter
2009-09-15T10:03:00.000Z	Mushrooms	DigitalKiwi	lol.. ok
