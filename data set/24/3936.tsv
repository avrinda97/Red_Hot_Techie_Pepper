2007-08-28T12:29:00.000Z	ahmed		so could you help step by step
2007-08-28T12:29:00.000Z	tom__666	ahmed	so just install it using your package manager
2007-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	tom__666	ahmed	or from a terminal go "sudo apt-get install exim4"
2007-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	ahmed		yes i know
2007-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	tom__666		agreed - it's a total mission
2007-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	tom__666		and exim is a pain in the *ss to configure :(
2007-08-28T12:30:00.000Z	ahmed		ok from where i read alot
2007-08-28T12:31:00.000Z	tom__666	ahmed	i think www.exim.org is a good place to start out
2007-08-28T12:32:00.000Z	ahmed	neverblue	but believe there's no time my company was ruining qmail on the fedora but the pc was stopped suddenly
2007-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	tom__666	ahmed	if you had qmail running and in a tight spot probably best to stick with fedora and just move the configs over to the new machine
2007-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	ahmed		could you send me a pdf with all info
2007-08-28T12:34:00.000Z	ahmed		<neverblue> the problem
2007-08-28T12:34:00.000Z	ahmed		is i should start the emarkting project
2007-08-28T12:35:00.000Z	ahmed		cause we will face real disaster
2007-08-28T12:38:00.000Z	ahmed		any one can help us on installing mail server on ubuntu
