2009-06-06T21:35:00.000Z	evanrmurphy		Any suggestions with my wireless issue? I'd been able to connect to wireless fine for months, but suddenly yesterday it started this pattern of trying to reach the network, making both spheres in the panel icon green, continuing to spin like for several seconds, and then finally failing. I've been on an Ethernet cable since then (which works fine btw) and started following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Wireles

2009-06-06T21:36:00.000Z	Drknezz	evanrmurphy	isn't it a net issue? (Try in winshit/another lappy)
2009-06-06T21:38:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	Drknezz	Thanks for your reply. Three other computers in the house have continued being able to connect just fine. Any other tips? (I'm running Jaunty on an Inspiron 1520.)
2009-06-06T21:38:00.000Z	Drknezz	evanrmurphy	hmmm
2009-06-06T21:38:00.000Z	Drknezz	evanrmurphy	you have native driver or ndiswrapper?
2009-06-06T21:39:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	Drknezz	Do you know how I could check that?
2009-06-06T21:39:00.000Z	Drknezz	evanrmurphy	did you even install a wireless driver? or it worked OOB?
2009-06-06T21:41:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	Drknezz	Did a clean install of Jaunty maybe three weeks ago, and it worked right away. I did not seek out a wireless driver.
2009-06-06T21:41:00.000Z	Drknezz	evanrmurphy	hmmm....
