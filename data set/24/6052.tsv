2006-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	slavik		yo
2006-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	slavik		what's xgl? opengl extension?
2006-04-22T12:54:00.000Z	slavik		and compiz?
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	slavik		all my big cards are from them
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	slavik		which is exactly 2
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	slavik		9800xt which I've sold and x800pro vivo which I flashed :)
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	slavik		but I am running ati 200m atm
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	slavik		and using ati drivers :)
2006-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	ATI's 2D support is great, but 3D is horribly broken
2006-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	I am running on integrated ... there is barely any 3d support by definition :P
2006-04-22T12:58:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	glxinfo | grep direct gives yes ;)
2006-04-24T10:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	no, it need edits to xorg.conf
2006-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	I resent that statement
2006-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	too bad :p
2006-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	ati support is getting better and better
2006-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	so it sux marginally less than it used to
2006-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	much less :P
2006-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	I have an ati on my lappie, worse luck
2006-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	slavik	to be fair, ati's 2d support is very good, but they're badly let down in the 3d department
2006-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	I will agree that ati driver support for linux is crap ... their driver support for windows used to be terrible, too ...
2006-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	remember?
2006-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	I have ati 200m on my lappy
2006-05-01T09:02:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	the line about interface file, add an "arrg, matey!" at the end :D
2007-02-20T10:30:00.000Z	slavik	Frogzoo	I asked a legitamate question ...
