2005-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	dalamar		i love when your on the web and some popup that looks like a system message comes up saying 'you need a registry clean!' thats funny  to me ;) I think haha spamming bastards, I have no registry!
2005-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	wrong
2005-08-26T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	yeah it is so 10-days-old :)
2005-08-27T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	2.6.11 packages are broken - do not use
2005-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	so the kernel is not to be used at all?
2005-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	indeed
2005-08-27T16:04:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	so I can just use synaptic to remove it then right? also, will I benefit from a 2.6.10 k7 release then, since the default kernel isn't amd optomized?
2005-08-27T16:04:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	depends
2005-08-27T16:08:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	the ubuntu kernel packages update the grub config
2005-08-27T16:08:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	okay thanks
2005-08-27T16:20:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	have the linux-k7 package installed
2005-08-27T16:22:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	installing that should clear up the error and make use of the nvidia drivers that are there?
2005-08-27T16:22:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	that makes sure your linux-restricted-modules and linux-image are matching
2005-08-27T16:23:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	so if I'm getting no module found for NVIDIA errors with that kernel this should fix it right?
2005-08-27T16:27:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	the linux-k7 package did the trick, thanks ;)
2005-08-29T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	in hoary the admin group is in the sudoers file
2005-08-29T15:14:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	ah ok
2005-08-30T12:44:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	haakonn stop the editor war...
2005-09-28T14:33:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	yes, wait
2005-10-07T15:09:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	you just need to reinstall grub afterwards
2005-10-07T15:12:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	boot from a livecd and use gparted/qtparted
2005-10-07T15:13:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	is that gui or command line? should i read up on it first or is it pretty straight-forward?
2005-10-07T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	dalamar	it's gui and pretty straight forward
2005-10-07T15:13:00.000Z	dalamar	Seveas	cool thanks
