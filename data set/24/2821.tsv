2009-12-22T07:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	it might keep extra copies of the old logs
2009-12-22T07:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	like mail.log.* or mail.log.*.gz
2009-12-22T07:26:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	it's keeping up to .6, i'd like it to keep up to .20 or something
2009-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	look in /etc/logrotate.d/
2009-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	i don't think logrotate deals with mail.log, nothing about mail in there, it's syslog something that deals with it
2009-12-22T07:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	then check /etc/syslog.conf
2009-12-22T07:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	try editing /etc/logrotate.conf.  There is setting in it for the amount of time to hold files
2009-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	it does say "rotate 4", but, inside /etc/logrotate.d/, there is nothing related to mail. so is logrotate.d just erasing the mail.log and not doing the other things?
2009-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	it is rotating mail.log using the default global settings in /etc/logrotate.conf
2009-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	you can add an extra entry in /etc/logrotate.d.  Look at the existing files there fore examples
2009-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	if you say so. i'll change it then to "rotate 32" (8 months i guess). i know something is already doing the rotation (syslogd?) so i won't add anything regarding mail.log in /etc/logrotate.d/
2009-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	thanks
2009-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	do you want to do that for ALL logs, or just mail.log?
2009-12-22T08:03:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	sorry. i'd like that for mail.log only, but i don't see any alternative, there is nothing about mail.log in logrotate.conf or logrotate.d
2009-12-22T08:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	then add something for it
2009-12-22T08:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	I'll see if I can find an example
2009-12-22T08:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	save the contents of http://pastebin.com/d4d4b519f to /etc/logrotate.d/mail as root
2009-12-22T08:07:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	i'm looking into syslog.conf, i don't think logrotate deals with mail.log. i mean, it can deal with it, but syslog is already doing log rotation for it.
2009-12-22T08:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	logrotate handles almost all log rotation
2009-12-22T08:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	including mail.log and almost everything else in /var/log
2009-12-22T08:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	danfg	I don't think syslog rotates anything without using logrotate
2009-12-22T08:16:00.000Z	danfg	lstarnes	i created /etc/logrotate.d/mail with your pastebin. thanks, i hope it works
