2009-04-30T18:00:00.000Z	shadeslayer	The1Qwerty_1	use pastebin this time
2009-04-30T18:01:00.000Z	shadeslayer	The1Qwerty_1	your battery is dying :P
2009-04-30T18:01:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	is that because it says last full charge was 82%

2009-04-30T18:03:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	I guess windows has some extra acpi controlling this that are propietry to the laptop?
2009-04-30T18:05:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	do you get the full 5hrs?
2009-04-30T18:06:00.000Z	shadeslayer	The1Qwerty_1	never tried tho thats the limit mentioned on the manual
2009-04-30T18:06:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	you had an acer correct?
2009-04-30T18:07:00.000Z	shadeslayer	The1Qwerty_1	nope,my one and only Dell on which im typing all this
2009-04-30T18:07:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	would the fact that its a dell make things anybetter (as in better support from Ubuntu) or just that you have a 9 cell battery?
2009-04-30T18:08:00.000Z	shadeslayer	The1Qwerty_1	well Dell does give hardware supported by ubuntu and vice versa,so maybe yes (for eg. Mini 9,10)
2009-04-30T18:09:00.000Z	The1Qwerty_1	shadeslayer	ok thanks for your help perhaps im just going to have to live with 2hrs
