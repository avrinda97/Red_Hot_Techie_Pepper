2011-06-14T08:00:00.000Z	androidbruce		can anyone help with samba and sharing directories with windows
2011-06-14T08:00:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	Best to ask your question straight out, then people who know will jump in
2011-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	asked earlier, guess im out of luck. error here,http://pastebin.com/0t1CwLsP
2011-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	checked the forums for many posts with no luck
2011-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	I'll take a quick look, but I'm not much of a "samba ninja"
2011-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	it's such a pita
2011-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	I take it you've tried: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2011-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	yeah lemme try again just for kicks
2011-06-14T08:04:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	no worries, just like to check to make sure ;)
2011-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	I don't think I've used samba4 specifically yet
2011-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	it's becoming a real chore sharing right now
2011-06-14T08:05:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	any ideas how to share a folder to a windows machine? samba the only way?
2011-06-14T08:06:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	or can i get a CIFS server going somehow
2011-06-14T08:06:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	could always use NFS: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324089
2011-06-14T08:06:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	can winfail mount nfs?
2011-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	yes, I believe it can
2011-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	according to that microsoft doco anyway
2011-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	ahh hmm
2011-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	give this a try: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9898882&postcount=11
2011-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	but yeah, otherwise, I'd use NFS, because I've had significantly better success with that, just in my own personal experience
2011-06-14T08:10:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	my ultimate goal here is to share with my xbox
2011-06-14T08:11:00.000Z	MrPPS	androidbruce	probably the cheapest way to do it - get a low end one, and just have it as a dedicated box
2011-06-14T08:11:00.000Z	androidbruce	MrPPS	yeah i might built a freenas
