2007-01-03T06:47:00.000Z	h00t		can anyone tell me why in the latest ubuntu i don't have the same level of flexibility in gnome desktop as in previous release and/or debian why can i put 2 panels on one side of the screen (one left other right)  or why do i have only 2 (instead of 4) workspaces
2007-01-03T06:49:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	right click the 2 desktops and add more.
2007-01-03T06:50:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	everything you mention i changed in the last 3 seconds
2007-01-03T06:50:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	where is the "2 deskops" i should r-click on to add more ...
2007-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	the applet that shows the mini desktops is in the lower right on my panel
2007-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	 got it
2007-01-03T06:53:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	try dragging a panel across?
2007-01-03T06:54:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	worked on mine
2007-01-03T06:55:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	how do i grab ... the shit that's "on" the panel is taking up and overlaping the panel itself
2007-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	ya gotta find a blank space to grab - it can be a challenge :)
2007-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	btw, mentioning shit is frowned upon
2007-01-03T07:00:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	check this out ... it worked but the problem is that since you cannot specify right/left the panels (if both not hidden) arrange on top of each other... they will though hide in 2 seperate corners BTW i guarantee you this was a feature taken out by ubuntu ppl to have "sensible defaults" as they put it ... BS i tell you BS
2007-01-03T07:00:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	maybe - complain to them...
2007-01-03T07:01:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	mine are side by side and both are not hidden
2007-01-03T07:03:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	right click on the panels properties and tell me if both say the same orientation (ie "bottom")
2007-01-03T07:04:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	yes - both say right
2007-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	i made them different widths so i could tell them apart
2007-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	which version of ubuntu are you using
2007-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	this issue i am testing on 6.10
2007-01-03T07:07:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	i swear to you i can't get them to be unhidden next to each other on the bottom only on top of each other
2007-01-03T07:07:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	there may be a bug - maybe worth reporting.  for me, no since i do not like so many panels anyway
2007-01-03T07:08:00.000Z	mnoir	h00t	i do believe you - linux works in mysterious ways
2007-01-03T07:08:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	well thanx for you help and testing ... i'll try to look for some help on gnome pages
2007-01-03T07:08:00.000Z	h00t	mnoir	seriously thanx
