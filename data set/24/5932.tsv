2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	youBun2		How would I go about running MSN Messenger from Ubuntu?
2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	youBun2		Without using crap Gaim
2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: use Kopete or Gaim
2006-03-24T17:19:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	Without using Gaim :-S I mean official MSN Messenger
2006-03-24T17:20:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: you want to run MS MSN client in Linux ?? why ?
2006-03-24T17:20:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	Because I dislike Linux
2006-03-24T17:21:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	I prefer OS X above all
2006-03-24T17:21:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: my advice... go to your bank, get some cash, go and buy Windows.
2006-03-24T17:22:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	Your advice is amatuer since my computer came with Windows XP Home Edition
2006-03-24T17:28:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: well... wireless or not, and no matter what OS it is.. there's always FTP and all...
2006-03-24T17:29:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	I have considered transferring my files via FTP but I personally don't understand why Ubuntu does not BURN certain file types to my DVD-Rs
2006-03-24T17:30:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: using K3b.. I never had any problems burning any kind of files...
2006-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	I can't burn .psd files, .db files and .rmvb files using GnomeBaker, K3B and a few other burners I have tried =S
2006-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: why wouldn't you... :)
2006-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: as if there was a filter... what error do you get ?
2006-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	It states that some files will not burn
2006-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: it's not like Linux to consider extensions....
2006-03-24T17:33:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: and it's not like linux not to get proper error descriptions or codes
2006-03-24T17:34:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: my industry is computer science.. and as crazy as it sounds.. all my colleagues use windows... so can we really rely on what people do ?
2006-03-24T17:35:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	hehe true
2006-03-24T17:36:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	I dislike Windows a lot but I've been kind of thrown in the deep end a little here. I was planning on logging in to Ubuntu now and again and picking up a few things a long the way, but since I can't boot Windows and continue other design work along side my PowerBook it makes things a little hard for me =|
2006-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	clem_yeats	youBun2	: you simply have a problem with your bootloader I believe.
2006-03-24T17:37:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	Yes sir I do =S
2006-03-24T17:38:00.000Z	youBun2	clem_yeats	I can access all the files on my Windows partition but just not boot Windows as a whole
