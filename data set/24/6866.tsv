2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		thats too bad
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		hmm
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		you all say different things, i mean, gnome is the most fancy one
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		and i like to keep it fancy ;)
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		but you all believe gnome will run slow on it?
2005-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	rodimus		and kde is faster than gnome?
2005-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	rodimus		ah , can one choose among these when installing?
2005-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	rodimus		i have no clue how to tweak linux so i hoped it would run pretty ok from the start
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	rodimus		does the live cd give a decent impression of ubuntu?
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	rodimus		damn, win xp runs fine, i thought ubuntu would run even faster
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	the live cd gave me such a good impression, i put racing stripes over the windows logo on my box.
2005-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	rodimus	flankk	really? i've downlaoded the live cd, gonna burn it in the morning and try it out
2005-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	rodimus		poopin: guess it takes a while to switch over completly
2005-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	the neat thing about a live cd, is you are actually using a full-blown linux system, but a lot slower :)
2005-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	rodimus		i tried out lighter live cd's like dsl and feather
2005-06-29T05:13:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	how much ram do you have?
2005-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	rodimus		but they werent too much eye candy
2005-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	rodimus		192
2005-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	it should run fine
2005-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	rodimus		flannk: guess the only way is to try it out
2005-06-29T05:14:00.000Z	rodimus		i heard installing programs is really simple on ubuntu
2005-06-29T05:15:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	naw, the way i did it was just format my drive and force-fed myself linux programs.  you get used to it after 2 months, then it actually is more convenient.
2005-06-29T05:16:00.000Z	rodimus		flannk: are there any programs you miss having on linux that you had on xp?
2005-06-29T05:17:00.000Z	flankk	rodimus	that's exactly what you think for the first two weeks; you're like, 'shit.. linux sux.. it has nothing that xp does' but if you force yourself to find ways around it, you will adapt fine.. there are alternative for -everything- nowadays.  most people have just become so attached to ms
