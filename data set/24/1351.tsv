2010-10-11T06:11:00.000Z	BuenGenio		morning
2010-10-11T06:12:00.000Z	BuenGenio		is there a decent, free VM that will let me boot an existing ubuntu installation from inside Windows?
2010-10-11T06:13:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	VMWare Player is the end-user free version, I use it for Win7 since it supports directX which virtualbox only supports OpenGL, You can't use Aero in vista/7 in virtualbox, but you can in VMWare Player
2010-10-11T06:14:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	but you need to create your "player image" first right
2010-10-11T06:14:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	I downloaded vmware player for free, installed it, setup a virtual machine and installed win7 and have been enjoying it ever since.
2010-10-11T06:15:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	interesting
2010-10-11T06:16:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	do you know if hardware in a guest OS will apear the same as in the host or will it be emulated to some generic cards/chipsets?
2010-10-11T06:16:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	its both actually, it still uses your gfx cards gpu but uses a generic fake driver
2010-10-11T06:17:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	yeah, but guest won't support hardware acceleration for example
2010-10-11T06:19:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	I'm very pleased with both vmware player and virtualbox. I like virtualbox better for customizable options, but I like vmware player better for performance. if you plan to play games and what not, i strongly reccomend vmware player.. if you're just looking to run your windows programs that wont run or run poorly in wine, virtualbox is very nice also.
2010-10-11T06:19:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	maco, if I boot an existing, standalone ubuntu install from a VM will it reconfigure my drivers and modules?
2010-10-11T06:20:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	maco, basically will it mess up any of  my settings next time I boot into Ubu?
2010-10-11T06:20:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	I never tried but I would assume so, it would haveto use drivers pertaining to the virtual environment
2010-10-11T06:20:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	although that being said, linux is usually good at adapting to new HW
2010-10-11T06:22:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	I think virtualbox has a way to convert a real drive to a virtual drive, I know vmware player does, so you can copy your physical boot and convert it to a virtual machine so you dont physically boot that machine. Me personally, I like them being virtual, because its one big file that i can backup and restore if anything goes wrong.
2010-10-11T06:22:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	true - I'm kind of limited on disk space
2010-10-11T06:23:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	which I do before i try to install any new software on my virtual windows.. I have gotten virii before and rebooted my virtual machine back to being fine in less than 5 minutes.
2010-10-11T06:23:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	you have an A/V or have you forgotten what it is :)
2010-10-11T06:24:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	you mean a KVM? a switcher?
2010-10-11T06:24:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	no, I mean antivirus ^-^
2010-10-11T06:25:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	oh I don't use it.. I don't need it.. I religiously backup my virtual drive to another drive before I install anything. if it craps out, oh well, overwrite the file and im back in buisness, so what does antivirus do to help me?
2010-10-11T06:26:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	helping prevent its spreading I'd say
2010-10-11T06:27:00.000Z	Talon_	BuenGenio	it cant escape the virtual environment, so it doesn't spread anywhere.
2010-10-11T06:27:00.000Z	BuenGenio	Talon_	you have internet
