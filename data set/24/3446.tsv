2012-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	Sazpaimon		also, I have an ubuntu VM that has the "waiting up to 60 seconds for network configuration" issue
2012-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	Sazpaimon		however, I can ssh into the machine just fine during this time
2012-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	Sazpaimon		so the network is up and running
2012-03-28T06:00:00.000Z	Sazpaimon		whats the deal
2012-03-28T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	ease up on the enter key dude
2012-03-28T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	you could remove network manager and use the interfaces file, will make things a little easier
2012-03-28T06:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	irc isn't incredibly secure, plus there are commands you ca run in scripts, which wil run as root rather than user
2012-03-28T06:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	its just a good habit to get into ;)
2012-03-28T06:27:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	can't argue there
2012-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	did you try setting the IP in /etc/network/interfaces
2012-03-28T07:16:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	it's set to DHCP, and like I said, I can ssh into the machine fine
2012-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	oneric
2012-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	is it a virtual system?
2012-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	yes
2012-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	what technology are you using?
2012-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	virtualbox
2012-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	vmware? virtualbox?
2012-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	have you asked in the #vbox channel, there may be a known issue
2012-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	could try changing the network device in the vbox config
2012-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	let me actually try killing all the network manager stuff in interfaces, that may be it. There are a few things listed as "auto" that shouldnt be
2012-11-16T20:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	you can symlink to a NTFS partition from Linux
2012-11-16T20:03:00.000Z	Sazpaimon	ActionParsnip	yes, I know you can make symbolic links on linux on an ntfs-3g partition
2012-11-16T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Sazpaimon	they will be different
