2006-12-31T07:49:00.000Z	band-aid		uuhhhhh
2006-12-31T07:49:00.000Z	band-aid		How do I associate to an Access Point in Ubuntu
2006-12-31T07:50:00.000Z	band-aid		yes
2006-12-31T07:51:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	is your card detected by edgy?
2006-12-31T07:52:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	I think so, it shows up as eth1 when I do iwconfig
2006-12-31T07:52:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	have you tried using NetworkManager?
2006-12-31T07:52:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	no
2006-12-31T07:52:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	at least I don't think I have. Is it installed by default
2006-12-31T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	if you want a graphical wasy way to connect to wireless networks, try sudo apt-get install nm-applet-gnome
2006-12-31T07:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	then reboot
2006-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	sorry the package is actually network-manager-gnome
2006-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	I have no way to access the internet on that computer
2006-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	it should be on the cd iirc
2006-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	what does iirc mean?
2006-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		perhaps not tho...
2006-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	band-aid		oh lol
2006-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		!info network-manager-gnome
2006-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	try installing it from CD (just put in the cd)
2006-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	band-aid	also, sudo network-admin provides basic wireless connectivity options
2006-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		like... wep
2006-12-31T08:04:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	ok I did the iwconfig command
2006-12-31T08:04:00.000Z	band-aid	pppoe_dude	but the dhclient failed
