2006-01-26T09:41:00.000Z	ejofee		is there any player for gnu-linux which allows for some typical desktop player features (found in many apps written for bill gates), like: (1) horizontal & vertical resizing & positioning; (2) subtitle size & positioning, delay &// rate (before i get any answer i must mention that mplayer, totem, and kaffeine don't seem to support any of these.)
2006-01-26T09:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	1) horizontal & vertical resizing & positioning  <-- seems to work with totem-xine or xfmedia here
2006-01-26T09:43:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	dusk: well, maybe i'll have to try those ones again. thank you. i might be back. :)
2006-01-26T09:46:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	this is the exact message i'm getting when trying to startup totem: "totem could not startup. no reason." :))
2006-01-26T09:46:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	any idea why?
2006-01-26T09:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	did you install totem-xine? the default totem is kind of... immature IMO
2006-01-26T09:47:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	i think not totem-xine. wait.
2006-01-26T09:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	 sudo apt-get install totem-xine  - and read the RestrictedFormats wiki
2006-01-26T09:48:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	thanks a lot. i am installing them. then just try to run totem again, or is there another command line for totem-xine?
2006-01-26T09:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	just "totem"
2006-01-26T09:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	you probably want w32codecs too, if you don't have them
2006-01-26T09:50:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	too bad totem doesn't include keyboard shortcuts, or a list of them
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	well, it has the usual ones from the menus - plus for full screen judt hit "f"
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	<esc> to return to non-fullscreen, and so on
2006-01-26T09:52:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	thanks
2006-01-26T10:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	heh - sudo apt-get install clue  ;P
2006-04-22T12:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	ubuntu only updates for security and major bugs
2006-04-22T12:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	it isn't usual to blame the distro for things that are clear from its policy statements, either
2006-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	all other important distros have at least one gaim beta, either it be official or unofficial. ubuntu has none. this is what i don't understand.
2006-04-22T12:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	ejofee	as I said, Ubuntu updates every 6 months on average - between those times no new software is added
2006-04-22T12:15:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	i was hoping i could at least find something unofficial
2006-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	ok
2006-04-22T12:21:00.000Z	ejofee	thoreauputic	tritium: however, please be the judge of it: am i crazy to feel "compile it yourself" is unfriendly?
