2005-06-18T11:06:00.000Z	randabis		you'd have to +x it first
2005-06-18T11:07:00.000Z	randabis		bah
2005-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	I'm a BSDer, breezy is rockin ;)
2005-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	randabis	tsume	in what way?
2005-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	Us BSDers know how to fix any problems we run into ;)
2005-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	updated software ;)
2005-06-18T11:08:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	which means.. less running in to bugs with updated software
2005-06-18T11:09:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	you haven't used BSD any then :)_
2005-06-18T11:09:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	We BSDers run in to software problems, so we must fix it outselves
2005-06-18T11:10:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	BSDers are more capable of figuring out problems than other people just because of experience.
2005-06-18T11:10:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	yes it does
2005-06-18T11:11:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	heck, everyone was piss and moaning about breezy's X being broken when it was just a simple mkfontdir command ;)
2005-06-18T11:11:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	experienced BSDers can fix any unix related problem ;)
2005-06-18T11:13:00.000Z	randabis	tsume	heh, fun. I'm just not inclined to play with Breezy at this point. I don't doubt your experience or skill. I'm just saying there is a possibility that you or someone COULD run into a problem that isn't easily solved or unsolvable
2005-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	all problems are solvable ;)
2005-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	randabis	tsume	to an extent, but that does not mean one will be able to always find the solution
2005-06-18T11:15:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	Never have run in that problem yet.
2005-06-18T11:16:00.000Z	randabis	tsume	and you may never run into that situation. I'm just saying it is possible
2005-06-18T11:20:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	any computer, new and old.
2005-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	I can see you are not experienced and (forgive me for saying) speaking out of your ass.
2005-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	randabis	tsume	yes, but in the context of nasa, their hardware tends to be archaic
2005-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	no, NASAs ISS technology is top of the line.
2005-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	go visit the center where they build the pieces and see for yourself.
2005-06-18T11:22:00.000Z	tsume	randabis	you completely missed what I said then. the ISS runs NetBSD, and a couple dumb linux terms for client controllers
