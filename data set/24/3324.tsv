2008-03-06T19:07:00.000Z	Cyntrox		Why do I get a "Permission denied" message on 'sudo echo "deb http://pkg-gnome.alioth.debian.org/debian/ experimental main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update'?
2008-03-06T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	pipe to tee instead.  The redirection occurs as your user
2008-03-06T19:09:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	care to write that as terminal code? =P
2008-03-06T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	echo foo | sudo tee -a FILE
2008-03-06T19:11:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	I tried 'echo "deb http://pkg-gnome.alioth.debian.org/debian/ experimental main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update' but it said 'sudo: /etc/apt/sources.list: command not found'... Did I misunderstand?
2008-03-06T19:11:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	sorry, I mean 'echo "deb http://pkg-gnome.alioth.debian.org/debian/ experimental main" |sudo /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update'
2008-03-06T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	you forgot the "tee -a".  Anyway, you don't want to do what you are doing.  You're likiely to end up with a broken system
2008-03-06T19:13:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	I'm just following the instructions for getting gstreamer... http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/
2008-03-06T19:13:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	gstrteamer is in the ubuntu repositories
2008-03-06T19:14:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	'sudo apt-get install gstreamer' tells me that the package could not be found...
2008-03-06T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	first, have you enabled the universe and multiverse repos
2008-03-06T19:15:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	No, I don't think so
2008-03-06T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	go to System -> Administration -> Software Sources and enable universe and multiverse
2008-03-06T19:18:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	It seems I had already enabeled it =P
2008-03-06T19:18:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	sorry for the inconvinience
2008-03-06T19:19:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	no inconvenience.  You found gstreamer then?
2008-03-06T19:19:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	Yes. But this raises another question: How do I install something when all I have is the link http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/rhythmbox/0.10/ ? sudo apt-get install FooBar?
2008-03-06T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	you always look for it in the repositories.  apt-get is one way on the command line.  Or you can use Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager.  rhythmbox should be installed by default though
2008-03-06T19:22:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	Yes, it seems it is already installed...
2008-03-06T19:22:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	check Sound and Video menu
2008-03-06T19:23:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	Indeed, I found it, thanks for all the help!
2008-04-08T19:02:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	mv
2008-04-08T19:02:00.000Z	Cyntrox	jrib	thanks
2008-04-09T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	Cyntrox	ifconfig
