2008-12-15T03:20:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Ok.
2008-12-15T03:17:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	please run http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh
2008-12-15T03:18:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	there's a typo in your /etc/asound.conf (see the ctl.pulse stanza)
2008-12-15T03:19:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Sure enough.
2008-12-15T03:19:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	also, as of intrepid, both your ~/.asoundrc and /etc/asound.conf are obsolete
2008-12-15T03:19:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	So.. uh... I don't need to worry about it, then?
2008-12-15T03:20:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Was just trying to follow instructions from * to get anything working, a while back.
2008-12-15T03:20:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	erase them
2008-12-15T03:21:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	we already ship the necessary bits in the libasound2-plugins package
2008-12-15T03:21:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	next, have you forcibly reset the mixer element levels?
2008-12-15T03:21:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	e.g., sudo service alsa-utils reset
2008-12-15T03:21:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Not yet.  Doing that now.
2008-12-15T03:22:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Got an amixer error: Invalid command!  Invalid card number.
2008-12-15T03:26:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	is .asoundrc a path that I should delete?
2008-12-15T03:26:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	does `amixer' return anything?
2008-12-15T03:26:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	you should have deleted both /etc/asound.conf and ~/.asoundrc*
2008-12-15T03:28:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Ok... that also deleted ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf.  Yes, amixer returns screenfulls of data
2008-12-15T03:29:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	same for `amixer -c0'?
2008-12-15T03:29:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	yes.
2008-12-15T03:29:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	good, does `sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils reset' still give you the same error message?
2008-12-15T03:30:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	(also, make sure you're using alsa-utils 1.0.17-0ubuntu3 from intrepid-updates)
2008-12-15T03:30:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	Yes.  It prints the general help about 15 times...
2008-12-15T03:31:00.000Z	storm-zen	crimsun	How to check that?
2008-12-15T03:31:00.000Z	crimsun	storm-zen	please join #ubuntu-audio-help
