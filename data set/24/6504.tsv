2006-12-06T07:56:00.000Z	JJones0207		This is what happens, I start up the computer with the CD with Ubuntu Installation Alternate. Then, I click Install in text mode, I check off english and stuff. Next, It checks for devices then I get the error "Your installation CD couldnt be mounted. This probaly means that a CD was not in the drive. If so you can insert it now and try again.

2006-12-06T07:58:00.000Z	JJones0207		<zaan> I'm there
2006-12-06T07:59:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	don't repeat please
2006-12-06T07:59:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	is it a SATA CD-ROM?
2006-12-06T07:59:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	how is it connected?
2006-12-06T08:01:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	have you used the "Check CD" boot option?
2006-12-06T08:07:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	that's not the reason
2006-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	the CD boots while the drive is under the control of the BIOS. Then the kernel tries to take over, which is when it fails for some reason.
2006-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	this happens sometimes when a CD-ROM is of the more recent SATA type, and is connected to a controller that doesn't have support. Hence my earlier question.
2006-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	since you've installed ubuntu before, that isn't the problem now.
2006-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	so you have the Ubuntu Desktop CD as well?
2006-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	yes
2006-12-06T08:12:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	can you borrow some RAM somewhere just for the installation?
2006-12-06T08:13:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	you might fare better with a xubuntu installation on that machine.
2006-12-06T08:14:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	it depends on what you mean by 'good'
2006-12-06T08:15:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	gnome is very user friendly, but it's also very slow on old systems like yours
2006-12-06T08:15:00.000Z	soundray	JJones0207	no, I'd try the regular one
