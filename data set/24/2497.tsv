2008-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Stonehambey		if I update my version of ubuntu to the latest, does it reinstall gnome etc?
2008-12-31T16:46:00.000Z	Stonehambey		it's just, in my infinite wisdom, I have accidentally uninstalled some gnome components
2008-12-31T16:47:00.000Z	Stonehambey		and I'm not sure how to get them back
2008-12-31T16:47:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop
2008-12-31T16:50:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	thanks this seems to be working
2008-12-31T16:54:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	you might want this too: sudo apt-get install gdm
2008-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	or do a fresh installation :)
2008-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	won't I lose all my files?
2008-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	you have a separate /home partition?
2008-12-31T16:56:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	or is everything in one partition?
2008-12-31T16:57:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	from a terminal type df and see if /home and on a separate /dev
2008-12-31T16:57:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	no it isn't :(
2008-12-31T16:58:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	then yes, a fresh installation would overwrite your files in /home
2008-12-31T16:58:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	that's why it's good to have /home on a separate partition
2008-12-31T16:59:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	did you install the server version or desktop?
2008-12-31T17:03:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	three finger salute works too
2008-12-31T17:10:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	should I consider putting /home on a separate partition?
2008-12-31T17:10:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	I would and do
2008-12-31T17:10:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	I always do a fresh install vs. upgrading
2008-12-31T17:11:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	cool, how would I go about doing that? Shall I gogole it?
2008-12-31T17:11:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	goggle and read up on it and make your own choice
2008-12-31T17:14:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	there is a lot of good guides here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/ to including partitioning
2008-12-31T17:18:00.000Z	Stonehambey	mrwes	thanks :)
2008-12-31T17:19:00.000Z	mrwes	Stonehambey	sure.... I try to share what little I know :)
