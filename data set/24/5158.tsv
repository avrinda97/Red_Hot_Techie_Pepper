2007-03-17T07:00:00.000Z	peter77		ia it possible to recover deleted files?
2007-03-17T07:00:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	erm... how deleted?
2007-03-17T07:00:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	if you have deleted them in gnome... they have gone into wastebasket/trash
2007-03-17T07:00:00.000Z	peter77	enyc	trash can then emptied deleted
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	which means they are in .Trash-peter77 folder
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	aah
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	erm not really... what filesystem were they on?
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	peter77		ext3
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	on ext3 linux hard disk? on a FAT12/16/32 p?
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	peter77		ext3
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	not really  then... youd need to search for the data sectors
2007-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	ext3 undelete = not really
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	restore from backup ;-)
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	peter77		so that isn't as easy as it is on ntfs
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	peter77		backup?
2007-03-17T07:02:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	due to the way linux ext3 works ... you cant really undelet things... ext2 is somewhat possible... can be done on FAT... depending how os removeds the dir entries and fragmentation
2007-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	ntfs is a proprietary filesystem...
2007-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	you should never rely on undelete on any filesystem really.. its a risky business
2007-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	what do you know about ntfs undelete anyway?
2007-03-17T07:03:00.000Z	peter77		cool, so once a file is deleted on linux it is deleted?
2007-03-17T07:04:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	well its hard to get back on EXT3 ... deuo to the way the structure works...
2007-03-17T07:04:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	data blocks are NOT overwritten by default!
2007-03-17T07:04:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	so you shouldnt conseider it "secure" from that point of view
2007-03-17T07:06:00.000Z	enyc	peter77	Factory ;-)
