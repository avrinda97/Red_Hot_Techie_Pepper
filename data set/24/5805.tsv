2007-02-10T07:49:00.000Z	yellow	kitche	i just want something for a small number of people to listen to
2007-02-10T07:49:00.000Z	kitche	yellow	yes but hard to help you for streaming audio and such if you don't know what you want to stream to
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z	kitche	yellow	then maybe icecast it's just like shoutcast
2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z	yellow	kitche	ok so icecast should work ?

2007-02-10T07:50:00.000Z	kitche	yellow	well you need a player to listen
2007-02-10T07:51:00.000Z	yellow	kitche	you mean for example winmedia player plugins, etcs or other plugins for the browser ?
