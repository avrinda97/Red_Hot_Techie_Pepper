2007-10-26T11:06:00.000Z	tiago		has any one found a way to install vmware under gusty gibbon?
2007-10-26T11:07:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	which vmware product? player or server?
2007-10-26T11:07:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	in either case, yes people have. They all work.
2007-10-26T11:07:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	is there a repository i can use?
2007-10-26T11:07:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	I currently have server installed on my server box and running workstation on my current PC.
2007-10-26T11:08:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	if you're comfortable installing for source archives, I'd grab it off VMware's website. Else enable the extra repos and apt-get away.
2007-10-26T11:08:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	is that just in sources?
2007-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	I take that back, no vmware packages are available from apt.
2007-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	actually dont listen to me lol Ive screwed over my install pretty bad and am no doubt missing repos/sources.
2007-10-26T11:10:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	how would i go about downloading and installing it from vmware? is it very complicated?
2007-10-26T11:11:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	they include a readme file but it mainly just involves their perl installer.
2007-10-26T11:11:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	is it gui friendly? or lots of commands?
2007-10-26T11:11:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	the installer is terminal based but it consists mainly of yes/no questions.
2007-10-26T11:12:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	vmware itself is gui based.
2007-10-26T11:12:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	ok ill give it a try
2007-10-26T11:13:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	the lack of packages and inability to use dual screen with my ati card are almost enough to send me back to feisty
2007-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	yes I dualhead working on a X1300/1550 or something like that at college (my machine).
2007-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	did it work out of the box?
2007-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	took me a class period (~2 hours) to get it to work.
2007-10-26T11:15:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	what was involved?
2007-10-26T11:17:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	Umm dont remember exactly but I followed two guides (both had great tips) and just played with it till it worked right.
2007-10-26T11:18:00.000Z	tiago	Creed	ok thanks mate
2007-10-26T11:18:00.000Z	Creed	tiago	anytime.
