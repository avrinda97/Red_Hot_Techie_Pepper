2008-03-29T14:22:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	u can let the update mnager handle it - it will download all the required packages & install em
2008-03-29T14:23:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	it usually works better then doing a command line upgrade from cd
2008-03-29T14:23:00.000Z	OsamaK	anaoum	That's too big for my concoction..
2008-03-29T14:23:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	ahh, so u downloaded the iso at work or something?

2008-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	OsamaK	anaoum	What's the diff between updating using a CD and the commend line?
2008-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	hmmm, well it will use the internet do download the packages if u use command line
2008-03-29T14:49:00.000Z	OsamaK	anaoum	I see that, I meant: You prefer commend like, why?
2008-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	OsamaK	anaoum	* commend line
2008-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	well i dont really prefer
2008-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	anaoum	OsamaK	cd is actually good if u want to upgrade many computers
