2010-07-21T02:52:00.000Z	unperson		The only possible clue I've uncovered is that if I invoke /usr/bin/hgtk from the command line I get the message "abort: This version of TortoiseHg requires Mercurial version 1.5.n to 1.6.n, but finds 1.4.3" which makes no sense since that executable is installed by the tortoisehg package which lists "mercurial (>= 1.4)" as its dependency.
2010-07-21T02:52:00.000Z	unperson		...also it seemed to be working fine two weeks ago.
2010-07-21T02:53:00.000Z	unperson		It may also be worth mentioning that the hg command line tools still work fine.
2010-07-21T02:54:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	launch nautilus from a terminal and watch for error messages
2010-07-21T02:54:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Yeah, I tried that but I got nothing.
2010-07-21T02:55:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	I actually got a message showing the nautilus job as having finished, so I wonder if it doesn't do a fork of some kind and let the parent process terminate.
2010-07-21T03:14:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Ah, the trick it to look in .xsession-errors.  And it's showing the same thing I mentioned before (because I think that just calls hgtk), namely, "abort: This version of TortoiseHg requires Mercurial version 1.5.n to 1.6.n, but finds 1.4.3".
2010-07-21T03:15:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Maybe the tortoisehg package was updated some time recently and the dependencies are screwed up.
2010-07-21T03:16:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	apt-cache show mercurial
2010-07-21T03:18:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	I'm not sure what you're thinking I ought to be looking for.  As I said, I have version 1.4.3 (1.4.3-1, actually).  I don't know if there's a way to see when that package version was added to the repo.
2010-07-21T03:26:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Were you thinking there was something useful to be gleaned from the output of 'apt-cache show mercurial' ?
2010-07-21T03:43:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	launchpad
2010-07-21T03:46:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Yes.  I'll try that once it starts working again.  At the moment it seems to be having difficulties.
2012-09-16T06:23:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	save yourself the pain and do a clean install, ubuntu desktop upgrades are still .. not very well tested
2012-09-16T06:24:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	I may go that way eventually, but given that it seems superficially to work 99% of the way and it took me a while to download the 2.5 GB of packages, I think I won't give up quite that easily.
2012-09-16T06:25:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	all the best
2012-09-16T06:27:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	It's funny.  I've been running Ubuntu since warty and for a long time version upgrades went quite smoothly.  One of the things I liked about Ubuntu is that it "just worked".  But recently my experience has been much more buggy (which goes for Ubuntu overall, actually).
2012-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	it's a consequence of system complexity growing with new "cooler" features
2012-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	I guess that's probably so.  For my part I'd take reliability over cool, but I recognize that's a subjective value judgment. :-)
2012-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	desktop-wise, i dont see how my any distro out there now is better than  the last install of  mandrake linux  i had in 2004!  it's another story on the server-side though.
2012-09-16T06:36:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	Assuming more googling doesn't yield an answer, do you think I should take my issue to ubuntuforums or file a bug on launchpad?
2012-09-16T06:37:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	perhaps the forums would help, i dont think filing a bug would really help even though you should
2012-09-16T06:38:00.000Z	unperson	violinappren	I suppose nothing stops me from doing both.
2012-09-16T06:39:00.000Z	violinappren	unperson	not that i know of
