2010-05-10T01:38:00.000Z	x_		I'm trying to force the version of plymouth in synaptic and it won't let me fall back to the original one that's included in Lucid.
2010-05-10T01:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	you mean an actual version difference? or you mean theme name?
2010-05-10T01:41:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	version difference...  I switched to a PPA version and now I can't switch back.
2010-05-10T01:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	oh, i see. have you gotten rid of the ppa from your software sources list?
2010-05-10T01:42:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	 Yes.
2010-05-10T01:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	ok. is the original .deb still in your /ver/cache/apt/archive directory?
2010-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	/VAR*
2010-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	 /var/cache/apt/archives  ...sorry
2010-05-10T01:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	you still here?
2010-05-10T01:46:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	cache is clear.
2010-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	ok, just go here and down at the bottom left under where it says 'Architecture' you can download the lucid plymouth .deb
2010-05-10T01:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/plymouth
2010-05-10T01:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	download that then you can try and install it on command line and see what happens
2010-05-10T01:54:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	  plymouth depends on libplymouth2 (= 0.8.2-2ubuntu2); however:  Version of libplymouth2 on system is 0.8.2-2ubuntu3~ppa1.
2010-05-10T01:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	roger... download that from website. if you just go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ then you can do a search on package name. then click on the 'lucid' link and it'll take you to the page where you can download the .deb file
2010-05-10T01:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	so, in other words... download the .deb for the 'libplymouth2' for standard lucid from there
2010-05-10T01:57:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	  Thanks!  I'm trying that right now.
2010-05-10T01:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	you might have to get a few more also.. you're welcome
2010-05-10T01:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	if you want to 'force' a package to install, i can tell you how. or you can look at then man page for 'dpkg'
2010-05-10T01:59:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	  The one question I have is how do I get the default plymouth theme back?  that seems to have been lost somewhere in this process.
2010-05-10T02:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	i'm not sure... trying to look
2010-05-10T02:03:00.000Z	x_	onetinsoldier	  gonna try rebooting now.  brb
2010-05-10T02:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	i don't know. perhaps install 'plymouth-theme-ubuntu-logo'? don't really know what the default one is. mine is ubuntu-studio
2010-05-10T02:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	x_	roger.. good luck!
