2008-02-08T06:52:00.000Z	oboy03		hi guys
2008-02-08T06:53:00.000Z	oboy03		if there is a problem with ubuntu does that mean the whole OS is done?
2008-02-08T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	almost never
2008-02-08T06:55:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	but you have made the first step, reinstall is the last resort :)
2008-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	In general, you won't be updating to a higher version except when updating the entire release
2008-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	I should say, you won't be updating software piecemeal, except in very extreme circumstances
2008-02-08T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	if you have something installed, and an update is released by _ubuntu_ , it will automatically be updated on your machine with your permission
2008-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	yes. Those are the updates I'm talking about. I was (indirectly) cautioning against updates from other sources, which is the main cause of the os breaking
2008-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Training has a book that will tell you much of what you need to know
2008-02-08T07:05:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	I do all my work on it. Run a couple local servers (like web and mysql) . And use a couple servers out there that use debian. I keep it all in the family :)
2008-02-08T07:06:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	not for gaming or serious sound work yet
2008-03-10T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	it can be several things, but the most common is the broken package needs packages that haven't been installed
2008-03-10T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	why not tell us exactly what's going on with your install, and go from there
2008-03-10T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	and the packages in particular are? Best way to show is to run   sudo apt-get -f install in a terminal, and put the complete error on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-03-10T07:29:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	it's a website. You run that command I gave, and copy and paste it there, and when you submit you get a url back. Give me that url
2008-03-10T07:31:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	ah, you have to close synaptic and/or the update manager first. Then run the command again.
2008-03-10T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	looking
2008-03-10T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	You are right, it seems to be a corrupted download. Not common :)    do   sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/perl-modules_5.8.8-7ubuntu3.1_all.deb , then run sudo apt-get -f install again. It will re-download the file and try to install again
2008-03-10T07:37:00.000Z	oboy03	nickrud	maybe it was caused by my internet
2008-03-10T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	could be. I don't think I've ever seen that one myself
2008-03-10T07:42:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	rm is remove.  sudo is a tool that gives you administrative rights, you need them to work outside of your home directory
2008-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	oboy03	nickrud	so i type it on terminal?
2008-03-10T07:43:00.000Z	oboy03	nickrud	and can use it for other ubuntu installations?
2008-03-10T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	oboy03	you would install the package,   system->admin->synaptic   and search (ctlr-f) for it. And yes, that's one of it's uses
