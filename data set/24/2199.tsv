2009-03-15T11:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	that will remove compiz's packages
2009-03-15T11:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	it may be safer to just disable it rather than removing it complerely
2009-03-15T11:25:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	in case I want to disable it... what should i do?
2009-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	in case I want to disable it... what should i do?
2009-03-15T11:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	give me a few minutes to find that out please
2009-03-15T11:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	did you remove compiz?
2009-03-15T11:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	you will need to reinstall compiz for that to work
2009-03-15T11:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	no, sudo apt-get install compiz
2009-03-15T11:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	you already have ubuntu started, just not the desktop environment.  Try running sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
2009-03-15T11:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	try ctrl+alt+f1
2009-03-15T12:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	you may need to run it as root
2009-03-15T12:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	in a terminal, try this: gksudo wireshark
2009-03-15T12:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	there may be an option in the applications > internet menu
2009-03-15T12:46:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	okay I run the wireshark into root, and start capturing packets.... now my problem is I cant catch any packets...
2009-03-15T12:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	which onterface did you try capturing?
2009-03-15T12:47:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	packets from lan..
2009-03-15T12:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	what was the name of it?
2009-03-15T12:48:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	wlan0 is the name
2009-03-15T12:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	try using "any"
2009-03-15T12:53:00.000Z	zapz	lstarnes	seems to be capturing local packets not from lan
2009-03-15T12:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	zapz	try checking dmesg for anything related to wlan0
