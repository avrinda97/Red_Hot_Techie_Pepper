2009-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	Caleb_		My question before..Which install option will mess up my vista?
2009-06-30T09:06:00.000Z	Caleb_		shardedx:Hi
2009-06-30T09:07:00.000Z	Caleb_		Now you see em, now you dont
2009-06-30T09:07:00.000Z	Caleb_		OH that reminds me
2009-06-30T09:08:00.000Z	Caleb_		Will ubuntu install on a ntfs/fat32 drive without format?
2009-06-30T09:10:00.000Z	Caleb_		does ubuntu work with windows partitions?
2009-06-30T09:10:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Don't install it to NTFS or FAT32, but I believe it read/writes them fine.
2009-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Make a new partition?
2009-06-30T09:14:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Make a new partition.
2009-06-30T09:15:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	You can resize the Windows partition, but I recommend two separate drives for simplicity.
2009-06-30T09:16:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Resize it. Do it manually. That's why I suggest a new drive entirely.
2009-06-30T09:17:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Are you resizing NTFS or FAT32? You should back it up regardless, but resizing NTFS is... strange.
2009-06-30T09:19:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Convert an NTFS partition to FAT32? o.o
2009-06-30T09:20:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	I recommend just backing it up and trying to resize. GParted should resize it fine, but resizing NTFS takes some time, so you'll have to wait a bit.
2009-06-30T09:54:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Shouldn't lag too badly with that much RAM.
2009-06-30T09:54:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	It's a slight hit, but it's not -slow-.
2009-06-30T09:59:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Yes, it will. I've run Ubuntu under Wubi in weaker.
2009-06-30T09:59:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	I have never tried Wubi in 64-bit though. Let us know how that works.
2009-06-30T10:06:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	Distro isn't WM. I use Ubuntu, but I don't use GNOME. I use IceWM.
2009-06-30T10:08:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	IceWM. Xfce is too slow, I think. I'm a nerdy power-user.
2009-06-30T10:10:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	IceWM is a very, very small window manager. No desktop, no wallpaper, no icons, nothing. Super fast.
2009-06-30T10:11:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	It's much faster than Xfce or Fluxbox.
2009-06-30T10:11:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	No, after installing icewm-themes, it can look like pretty much anything. Mine looks like OS/2 Warp.
2009-06-30T10:13:00.000Z	mefached	Caleb_	For GNOME, google gnome-look.
