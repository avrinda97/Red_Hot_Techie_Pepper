2006-08-14T13:54:00.000Z	madc		has anyone observed an error with firefox/folck (any gecko based browser) locking the system up when viewing png's?
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	fk6	madc	can you reproduce it?
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	fk6	madc	url?
2006-08-14T13:56:00.000Z	fk6	madc	any strange plugins?
2006-08-14T13:56:00.000Z	madc	fk6	I uninstalled all the plugins... disabled javascript...etc
2006-08-14T13:58:00.000Z	fk6	madc	locks your remote screen? that sure is strange. have you tried the mozilla ppl on there irc server?
2006-08-14T13:59:00.000Z	fk6	madc	are the binaries the same?
2006-08-14T13:59:00.000Z	madc	fk6	yes.
2006-08-14T13:59:00.000Z	fk6	madc	what is the url?
2006-08-14T14:00:00.000Z	fk6	madc	identical distributions?
2006-08-14T14:02:00.000Z	fk6	madc	that png looks normal, are the libpng binaries the same?
2006-08-14T14:02:00.000Z	fk6	madc	any other crashes with this machine?
2006-08-14T14:04:00.000Z	fk6	madc	why should reinstalling ff help?
2006-08-14T14:04:00.000Z	madc	fk6	possibly something has become corrupted, its my first course of action
2006-08-14T14:04:00.000Z	fk6	madc	save the ff dir, reinstall and in case diff
2006-08-14T14:05:00.000Z	madc	fk6	yes already moved it to to a diff
2006-08-14T14:05:00.000Z	fk6	madc	i guess the .user dirs are also the same?
2006-08-14T14:05:00.000Z	madc	fk6	absolutly
2006-08-14T14:05:00.000Z	fk6	madc	neutrinos....
2006-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	fk6	madc	then you would also have other crashes....and not necessarily reproducable with only the png...
2006-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	fk6	madc	have you tried without flash/java?
2006-08-14T14:09:00.000Z	madc	fk6	yes when I revinstalled ff
2006-08-14T14:10:00.000Z	fk6	madc	right, you can't even ssh to the machine anymore, when she locks up?
2006-08-14T14:10:00.000Z	madc	fk6	correct, its a hard lock
