2007-09-30T07:46:00.000Z	ihope_		Well, I guess Ubuntu works fine in recovery mode, but when I boot it into normal mode, it stops after saying that the cupsd started or something.
2007-09-30T07:46:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	are you able to alt+F2 and then start the display manager?
2007-09-30T07:47:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	after the normal boot, when it says the thing about cupsd?
2007-09-30T07:47:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	yes
2007-09-30T07:47:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	I'll try.
2007-09-30T07:47:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	do you know how?
2007-09-30T07:47:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	how to press Alt+F2?
2007-09-30T07:48:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	how to start gdm
2007-09-30T07:48:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	I assume you're running GNOME
2007-09-30T07:48:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	are you running Gnome?
2007-09-30T07:49:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	probably; I pretty much just installed Ubuntu.
2007-09-30T07:49:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	then you are
2007-09-30T07:49:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	after cupsd loads, hit alt+F2. Then type "/etc/init.d/gdm start" without quotes
2007-09-30T07:50:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	that will start the graphical interface
2007-09-30T07:50:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	well, the cupsd message disappears after a few seconds. I pressed alt+F2 and there's still nothing on my screen, besides my monitor yelling at me.
2007-09-30T07:50:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	ahahaha. What's it saying?
2007-09-30T07:51:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	well, in the corner, it's switching between "digital" and "analog", and there's something in the middle about something non-optimal.
2007-09-30T07:51:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	that's odd
2007-09-30T07:52:00.000Z	ihope_	SunsparcSolaris	oh, I just saw an X cursor on the screen...
2007-09-30T07:52:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	good
2007-09-30T07:53:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	try the alt+F2 /etc/init.d/gdm start thing again
2007-09-30T07:54:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	that's a good sign
2007-09-30T07:55:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	try it anyway. Better than where you were at before
2007-09-30T07:56:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	ihope_	could you register your nick and then PM me?
