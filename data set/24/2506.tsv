2010-02-27T08:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	Open another application and start playing sound
2010-02-27T08:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	Your understanding is incorrect.
2010-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Then please explain
2010-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	If removing pulseaudio does cause problems it's not a kernel change that has done it. Current alsa can still handle multiple sound sources just fine.
2010-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Then what the hell do we need that POS pulseaudio for then?
2010-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	The ability to run applications that have different latency requirements without having them all have to use the least common denominator as a buffer size using more battery. Output hot plugging / redirection, network sound. Per application volume control...
2010-02-27T08:44:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	I'm not saying I don't believe you, but I've never heard of any of those abilities being attributed to PA.  In fact, I've never seen any GUI for PA to do things like volume controls for individual apps.
2010-02-27T08:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	Open up System > Preferences > Sound in karmic right now if you are using pulseaudio
2010-02-27T08:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	The per application volume control is in the "applications" tab.
2010-02-27T08:46:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	OK I admit I never saw that before, but there's only one app there.  alsa plugin firefox.  How does one add applications?
2010-02-27T08:47:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	OK, will fool around with that later.  Thanks for the info.  I still hate it, but at least I now know it's good for something.  When it works.
2010-02-27T08:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	You're welcome.
2010-02-27T08:48:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Can I quote your text on that blog post (attributed or not, your choice)?
2010-02-27T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	No, let me get a link from the creator of pulseaudio that explains the details of that latency bit better.
2010-02-27T08:50:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	M'kay.  Thanks.
2010-02-27T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	In fact if you are willing to take the time, http://0pointer.de/blog/ has many posts that are worth reading ( still looking for the one on buffer sizes )
2010-02-27T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	Here is a good short post about features: http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/win7-plays-catchup.html
2010-02-27T08:55:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Thanks.  I'll read through those tomorrow and mention them in my post.  Feel free to comment on the post yourself, though.  I'm not a hater, I just never met anyone who didn't have problems with pulseaudio.
2010-02-27T08:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	You're welcome. This post is probably good to read before you write a blog post similar to the one he refutes :) http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/jeffrey-stedfast.html
2010-02-27T09:01:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Is that dude on the pulse project?
2010-02-27T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	He is *the* pulseaudio developer. I don't think there are any other major contributors ( though I may be wrong )
2010-02-27T09:03:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	OK, thanks again.  I'll study them tomorrow at my LUG's InstallFest http://www.blu.org/cgi-bin/calendar/2010-ifest36
2010-02-27T09:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dj_segfault	You're welcome.
2011-11-14T07:18:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Jordan_U	Fair enough.  My apologies.  I asked a question, then that topic came up.
