2005-01-11T12:32:00.000Z	Prasatko		hello.help please. My soundcard works only for root, not for other users, (ubuntu, kernel 2.6).
2005-01-11T12:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	are you in the group "audio" ?
2005-01-11T12:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	type `groups` to find out (in a terminal)
2005-01-11T12:35:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	no.
2005-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	how to add user to group?
2005-01-11T12:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	not in audio? Well try sudo adduser <your user name> audio
2005-01-11T12:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	log out and back in after adding your user
2005-01-11T12:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	then type groups again to confirm, if you wish
2005-01-11T12:40:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	ok, Thank you.
2005-01-11T12:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	hope it helps - sounds odd that you aren't in that group
2005-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	I installed debian with kernel 2.2.20, then upgraded to 2.6 (ubuntu), i'm not a experienced linux user
2005-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	ah. So you upgraded to a 2.6 kernel from Woddy (stable) ?
2005-01-11T12:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	did you install Ubuntu, or just the kernel?
2005-01-11T12:44:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	I installed minimal version of debian, then I changed apt sources to ubuntu and also changed kernel to ubuntu.
2005-01-11T12:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	I don't think that's a wise move - Woody has all kinds of differences and a direct update to Ubuntu is not going to be trivial
2005-01-11T12:47:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	yes, you are right, as I said, I'm not experienced, so I will probably install only debian again
2005-01-11T12:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	unless you enjoy troubleshooting, I think an install from an Ubuntu disk would be safer : for one thing, 2.6 kernels require a new version of module utilities
2005-01-11T12:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	if you want straight Debian, use the new installer
2005-01-11T12:49:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	I had problems installing ubuntu, because in my notebook there is no CDROM,NET,FLOPPY, only HDD :)
2005-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	ah - yes that would be tricky
2005-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	I don't know other distro (except debian) that can installed from dos partition
2005-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	there are others, but I use Debian so I'd recommand it anyway: rather than making the big jump to Ubuntu, you could just do an apt-get dist-upgrade from Woody or install Sarge and be done with it
2005-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	Prasatko	thoreauputic	Ok, i think it will be best :) thank you
2005-01-11T12:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Prasatko	good luck :)
