2008-10-26T05:31:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		How do I mount a swap partition that insn't on fstab?
2008-10-26T05:33:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	swapon /dev/device
2008-10-26T05:34:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	thanks
2008-10-26T05:34:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	more specificly, as root:   swapon inode     it can be a partition or file.
2008-10-26T05:37:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	how do I mount it to take files out of it
2008-10-26T05:37:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	wow.  files in swap space ???
2008-10-26T05:37:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	maybe we need to redefine swap here
2008-10-26T05:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	it is swap, i accidentally put stuff in it under windows

2008-10-26T05:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	:D
2008-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	sudo fdisk -l  #find out what fs it says is there   or at least what device it is,  and    file -s /dev/device
2008-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	happyness!
2008-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	you know what format (filesystem) is there now ?   mount it with something like:  sudo mount -o fmask=000,dmask=000 -t ntfs-3g /dev/device /mnt
2008-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	as i said, swap
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	do you question that?
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	only how you can have files there and expect to retreve them.  but hey, i don't use swap.
2008-10-26T05:46:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	i'm with csilk   how did you do this ?
2008-10-26T05:48:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	then use that program and retrieve your files
2008-10-26T05:48:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	I don't have windows anymore
2008-10-26T05:49:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	and if that partition has been mounted as swap space, i highly doubt that you have usable data one it anymore either.
2008-10-26T05:50:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	it hasn't been mounted
2008-10-26T05:00:00.000Z	_2	D3RGPS31	someone in ##linuxhelp or ##linux might know something about that.   sometimes you find a developer in there
2008-10-26T05:01:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	_2	thanks
