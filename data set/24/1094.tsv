2010-07-21T10:53:00.000Z	Marcus		I have the purple screen of death, it comes up just after the little ubuntu logo and dots, then it freezes, how can I reboot to terminal instead. Is there a command like F6 while its booting? I use UBUNTU10.04
2010-07-21T10:53:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	hold shift while grub loads, boot to recovery
2010-07-21T10:53:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	I've tried that but nothing happens, when do I start holding shift?
2010-07-21T10:54:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	before or after the little underscore?
2010-07-21T10:54:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	After your BIOS is finished, before
2010-07-21T10:57:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	I held it down non-stop and I get the little log, then the dots underneath, then goes to purple and freezes.
2010-07-21T10:57:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	no terminal
2010-07-21T10:57:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	start holding AFTER   BIOS is finished?
2010-07-21T10:57:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	k, thx
2010-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	I held it down non-stop and I get the little log, then the dots underneath, then goes to purple and freezes.
2010-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	is there some way to change the boot so that it doesn't try and load my graphics card drivers?
2010-07-21T10:59:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	I recently updated them, and I think that might be a problem.
2010-07-21T11:00:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	you need to get into grub to set vesa at boot
2010-07-21T11:00:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	use a LiveCD and chroot to uninstall the settings
2010-07-21T11:01:00.000Z	Marcus	peepingtom	I have livecd, and it works. I can boot into it fine. What do I do? chroot what?
2010-07-21T11:02:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	boot livecd, mount your hard drive to a folder, chroot to that folder. basically this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=157250  but no knoppix

2010-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	sorry I thought you needed some really specific help, I meant paste your error messages using
2010-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	so someone can look at them and help you

2010-07-22T08:48:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	erm oops
2010-07-22T08:49:00.000Z	peepingtom	Marcus	you can chroot using that folder, you still need to point chroot at that folder though
