2010-02-14T23:23:00.000Z	askhader		Does wpa_supplicant need to be running as a daemon in order to start wpa_cli ?
2010-02-14T23:24:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	yes , i beleive so
2010-02-14T23:25:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	How do I "start" wpa_supplicant? When I issue a wpa_supplicant -Dwext -ieth1 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf   and then start wpa_cli it says that is unable to connect to wpa_supplicant
2010-02-14T23:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	pastebin your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	http://pastebin.ca/index.php
2010-02-14T23:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	it's empty
2010-02-14T23:30:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	Uh wooops one sec
2010-02-14T23:31:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	http://pastebin.ca/1796443
2010-02-14T23:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	 that link isn't working either
2010-02-14T23:32:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	http://pastebin.ca/1796443 Works for me
2010-02-14T23:33:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	I can upload it elsewhere if it's not working
2010-02-14T23:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	ok got it ..try : sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2010-02-14T23:37:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	Well now even the ethernet card lost its connection :P
2010-02-14T23:38:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	And wpa_cli still cannot connect to wpa_Supplicant
2010-02-14T23:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	ok run sudo dhclient eth0 , to reconnect your wired/ethernet
2010-02-14T23:40:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	Yeah already did that.
2010-02-14T23:40:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	But the original problem remains.
2010-02-14T23:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	what does wpa_cli have to do with wpa_supplicant?
2010-02-14T23:41:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	Uhh have you ever run wpa_cli before?
2010-02-14T23:42:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	Okay well perhaps that question is just about as useful as the question 'Why does wpa_cli say that it failed to connect to wpa_Supplicant" ?
2010-02-14T23:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	failed to read or failed to connect ?
2010-02-14T23:44:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	"Could not connect to wpa_supplicant - re-trying"
2010-02-14T23:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	askhader	what command is creating that output in the terminal ?
2010-02-14T23:45:00.000Z	askhader	BluesKaj	wpa_cli
