2010-01-13T05:44:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	ok what fs was that hdd when you started out ?
2010-01-13T05:44:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	and where do you get that the fs is not recognised now ?
2010-01-13T05:45:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	fdisk -l reports its a Linux system though
2010-01-13T05:45:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	have you tried mounting it ? might jsut be gparted that's goofing off
2010-01-13T05:45:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	yeah it just hangs

2010-01-13T05:46:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	try booting the live cd and mounting it, see if that helps , at the very least it might allow you to recover the data
2010-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	i was thinking about that.  Ill give that a go in a little bit
2010-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	but I recommend you prepare yourself for hte possibliltty that it's effed up
2010-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	whats the easiest way to just to a fs check on the disk?
2010-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	if it is ill try not to cry too much, i have some backups, there dated but i think i can manage
2010-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	Pelo	mattgyver	 sudo fsck /dev/sd...
2010-01-13T05:48:00.000Z	mattgyver	Pelo	thanks.  Ill check out a live cd in a few and see if i can get the data back, if not ill wipe it
