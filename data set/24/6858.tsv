2005-07-24T11:24:00.000Z	FlannelKing		Dont Touch C#
2005-07-24T11:26:00.000Z	FlannelKing		Actually, the Dvorak/Qwerty difference is mythological as well
2005-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	Okay, thank you for your advice.
2005-07-24T11:20:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	C
2005-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	Why, perchance?
2005-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	actually, learn C++
2005-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	I'm still going to have to learn C in order to learn C++, aren't I?
2005-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	No, C++ is not a superset of C++
2005-07-24T11:21:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	erm, C
2005-07-24T11:22:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	learn c++, skip C, if you konw C++ you can program C with only a few tweaks, and learing C++ will teach you all the basics of programming Java
2005-07-24T11:22:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	Razor-X : Is there another language I should be learning before C even?
2005-07-24T11:22:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	C++
2005-07-24T11:22:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	the first thing C++ people will do is try and unteach you C
2005-07-24T11:24:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	yeah, take a look... here: http://relisoft.com/book/index.htm, free, online, quality, C++ book
2005-07-24T11:25:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	C is still pretty low level
2005-07-24T11:26:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	Razor-X: So if I went ahead and learned C, would it be a good foundation for what I'll need to learn with C++?
2005-07-24T11:26:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	it will be a detrement to you learning C++
2005-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	you're better off learning c++, which will teach you basically everything you need for C programming
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	try that web book
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	What's the URL again, please?
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	http://relisoft.com/book/index.htm
2005-07-24T11:38:00.000Z	Harold	FlannelKing	Razor-X : So what's your opinion of the best C++ compiler for Linux, then?
2005-07-24T11:40:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	there are, but there isnt any wrong with g++
2005-07-24T11:45:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Harold	you'll understand when you learn an OO language
