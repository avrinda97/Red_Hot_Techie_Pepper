2010-09-10T18:00:00.000Z	undecim		Does anyone know why this conditional in conky would be giving a result in Arch that is opposite what I get in Ubuntu? I'm guessing it's a bug in this conky version: ${if_existing /sys/class/net/eth0/operstate up}
2010-09-10T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	well do the contents of /sys/class/net/eth0/operstate differ?  What does $if_existing do?
2010-09-10T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	or "if_existing" i guess
2010-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	if_existing checks for the existence of a file, and also checks the contents of the file for the first parameter given to if_existing
2010-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	k, so what are the contents on each system?
2010-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	In this case, it should be true if eth0 is up (which it's not) and false when it's down
2010-09-10T18:02:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Contents of the files are identical
2010-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	.conkyrs is copied directly from the other system backup (which is up-to-date)
2010-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	ubuntu version or arch version isn't doing what you expect?
2010-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Arch. (i know this is an Ubuntu channel, lol)
2010-09-10T18:03:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	I also have a similar conditional for wlan0, which is currently up, but it's returning false, which it shouldn't be...
2010-09-10T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	#archlinux can probably help better.  Maybe they use different permissions somewhere?  Don't know
2010-09-10T18:04:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Yeah, I was omw there
2010-09-10T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	you haven't asked in the last 3 hours though :)
2010-09-10T18:05:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Can someone give me their conky version?
2010-09-10T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	what do you mean?
2010-09-10T18:06:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Tell me what version you have.
2010-09-10T18:06:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	odd... it's the same version.
2010-09-10T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	you can check for debian/ubuntu specific patches in the source deb, but I doubt this is why
2010-09-10T18:17:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	Well, the distro is the only variable... It seems to be a bug in the Arch version though
2010-09-15T01:10:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	yes
2010-09-15T01:10:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	edbian: k. tyr
2011-02-16T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	undecim	debsums
2011-02-16T19:09:00.000Z	undecim	jrib	ty
