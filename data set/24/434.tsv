2012-09-30T17:58:00.000Z	yekoms	jrib	hes trying to kill a service process i bet
2012-09-30T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	heh
2012-09-30T20:54:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	you may be using an ssh key...
2012-09-30T20:55:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	how/why did you enable the root account?
2012-09-30T20:56:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	ask your provider then
2012-09-30T20:56:00.000Z	yekoms	jrib	i am my provider ;)
2012-09-30T20:57:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	so then I repeat my question... "how/why did you enable root?"
2012-09-30T20:58:00.000Z	yekoms	jrib	again, root was enabled automaticly VIA the OS Template provided with OpenVZ.
2012-09-30T20:58:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	then ask the provider of the template
2012-09-30T21:07:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	broken in what way?
2012-09-30T21:08:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	seems to work ok here on 12.04
2012-09-30T21:09:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	by default, lighttpd will run as www-data
2012-09-30T21:10:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	grepping ps aux like that doesn't seem ideal
2012-09-30T21:12:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	I still wouldn't recommend that
2012-09-30T21:12:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	well, what if you have a process like lighttpdxyz.  Why won't lighttpd create a pid file?
2012-09-30T21:13:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	did you change any of the default setup?  You said before you had it running as non-root, but that's default behavior already (as www-data)
2012-09-30T21:14:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	tried what as the default user, and other users?
2012-09-30T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	how did you "select black"?  I'm not sure what you mean
2012-09-30T21:15:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	more importantly, did it create a pid file originally?  When it was running as www-data right after install?
2012-09-30T21:19:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	in any case, I'd suggest taking a look at the script in 12.04 and comparing it to the one you have.  It's a much better idea to have the pid stored when the process is started so you make sure you are stopping the correct process
2012-09-30T21:21:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	you said you were using 11.10 10 minutes ago...
2012-10-08T22:40:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	maybe the times were off when you first started (note I don't actually know if this would matter)
2012-10-08T22:41:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	well maybe ntpd fixed the times too late.  Again, I'm just making a guess
2012-10-08T22:42:00.000Z	jrib	yekoms	now
