2011-06-14T19:04:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		which is why I'm using the minimal install as a base
2011-06-14T19:04:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		No.
2011-06-14T19:04:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2011-06-14T19:04:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		The 11.04 x86 version.
2011-06-14T19:05:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Yes, on my other computer
2011-06-14T19:05:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		I'm connected to it via SSH
2011-06-14T19:06:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		I'm using PuTTY.
2011-06-14T19:06:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		Yeah
2011-06-14T19:06:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		That starts X, but GNOME (which I installed gnome-core, after some googling) wouldn't start
2011-06-14T19:06:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		and X wouldn't start on bootup
2011-06-14T19:07:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	how do you want us to help you? you installed the minimal and you don't want that, but you don't want ubuntu-desktop. so what do you want?
2011-06-14T19:10:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	sudo apt-get install gnome
2011-06-14T19:15:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	sudo apt-get install whatever.deb (keep in mind whatever will not get security updates and may break during your next release upgrade)
2011-06-14T19:20:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	escott	yep, I've got that. Setting up it's config now. Thanks
2011-06-14T19:21:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	escott	well no, I appreciate him / her bringing that up as an alternative. I'll definitely be looking into it
2011-06-14T19:23:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	putty does but you have to install an x server and start it first on windows
2011-06-14T19:42:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	dpkg --get-selections
2011-06-17T09:08:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	escott	I wouldn't even know where to get started with that. :/
2011-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	theoretically, but lots of things are different. its certainly not supported
2011-06-17T09:08:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	you could try booting a vm of the install cd and then installing to a raw image... then chroot in to install the bootloader
2011-06-17T09:09:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	there is an ubuntu minimal netboot. you might try that. its the closest to a debian bootstrap that i am aware of
2011-06-17T09:09:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	escott	there's a netboot of that?
2011-06-17T09:10:00.000Z	escott	TheLifelessOne	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/Netboot
2011-06-17T09:10:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	escott	Thanks
