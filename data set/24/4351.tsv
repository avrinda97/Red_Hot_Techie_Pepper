2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		im gettin really frustrated
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		where are the usplash splashes located
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		i want to modify one
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		not just change it
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		modify one of the splashes
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	blahblahx		so where is it located?
2007-09-25T14:21:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	you can't really modify per se like that. It's not like they are pngs or something that you can gimp
2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	no, you have to realize that there is no graphical server running when those displays so graphics can't be used really
2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	you see it well before x server is started
2007-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	without x server, conventional graphics can't  be used
2007-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	no but there are ways to convert things to usplash, but not the other way around
2007-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	I just want to add an extra for loop to this compiled binary, nope not going to happen
2007-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	they probably had the source png, or reverse engineered it by eye
2007-09-25T14:26:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	unless you know how to uncompile something though which I am pretty sure can't be done, then your approach isn't going to happen
2007-09-25T14:27:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	that's a grub splash
2007-11-04T21:38:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	did you uninstall totem-mozilla?
2007-11-04T21:39:00.000Z	blahblahx	bruenig	its not installed. what happens is the mplayer mozilla box shows up where the video should be, but when i click play it flashes: getting playlist, and then doesnt play the movie
2007-11-04T21:40:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	probably need to configure it
2007-11-04T21:40:00.000Z	blahblahx	bruenig	or is there another media player i can use that will integrate seamlessly?
2007-11-04T21:41:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	it does integrate seamlessly, configure it, don't be lazy
2007-11-04T21:41:00.000Z	blahblahx	bruenig	how do i configure it?
2007-11-04T21:41:00.000Z	bruenig	blahblahx	right click
2007-11-04T21:45:00.000Z	blahblahx	bruenig	okay wma works now but no quicktime
2007-11-04T21:47:00.000Z	blahblahx	bruenig	uhhhhhh
