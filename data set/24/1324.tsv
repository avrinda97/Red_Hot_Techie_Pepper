2010-07-12T21:38:00.000Z	Spaztic_One		I am trying to connect to another computer directly via Ethernet, this one is Lucid, the other is WinXP. Can someone help me?
2010-07-12T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 if you are doing Network card to network card. You will need a 'crossover' cable. unless the nic's are gigibit.
2010-07-12T21:39:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	I thought most NICs would auto-detect and such anymore.
2010-07-12T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 ive not bought a new NIC in ages.. most all my machines come ith them built in. :) so cant verify or deny that.
2010-07-12T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 but I do belive the auto-detext Is a feature standard in GiB speed nics'
2010-07-12T21:42:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	Ah, ok. And yea, the NICs in both computers are built in, Lucid one is a laptop. Not sure the age of either at the moment. Laptop was bought used about 2-3 weeks ago, and I've had the tower for years (five or so seems about right)
2010-07-12T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 You will need to either install a dhcp server on one box. or assign static ip's to each box.
2010-07-12T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 then they will be networked.  If they can ping each other.. they are networkded properly. Then you configure whatever services you want
2010-07-12T21:47:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	They are both on the same wireless network already. Does this complicate things, make them easier, or not have any significant effect at all?
2010-07-12T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 wireless is a whole different ballgame.. You never mentioned wireless.
2010-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 still you would need a DHCP server. or set up static ips or some sort of ad-hoc network. (i think thats the proper term) if they can ping eacjh other. they are working
2010-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	Yes, I know. Wireless is significantly slower and thus I am wanting to use the ethernet cable.
2010-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 shouldent be too hard to get going. have windows box make a network. have linux box scan/connect to it
2010-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	Ah, ok.
2010-07-12T21:49:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	Sounds good. Thanks.
2010-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 i got an odd laptop. if i use the switch to turn off wireless.. i have to go to windows.. turn it back on.. then reboot.. :( i never touch the switch any more
2010-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	Don't have anything other than Lucid on this machine.
2010-07-14T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 ive seen/heard of so many laptops with flakey switches..  You may want to check the forums for youir exact make/model - ther may be some tweaks for it
2010-08-21T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 wine or its variants/spinoffs or run in a virtual machine.. thats the 2 options
2011-01-12T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 make a new user - see if it works for them? If so you could try resetting all your gnome settings back to defaults.  Ive seen simile rerror messages befor.. but basically cleaned out/reset gnome back to defaults to fix them
2011-01-12T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 if you double click on a folder - does it load in the file manager?
2011-01-12T20:06:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	if I click on "home" nautilus opens fine, and browsing folders in nautilus works fine. Just the networking and computer locations that don't work
2011-01-12T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spaztic_One	 Hmm.. Never noticed that issue befor.
2011-01-12T20:08:00.000Z	Spaztic_One	Dr_Willis	yeah. Its strange. I think it started out as just the computer location not working. Well, I have Dolphin from Kubuntu installed, and that seems to work fine for network browsing.
