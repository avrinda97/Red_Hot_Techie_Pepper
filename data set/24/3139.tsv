2008-04-22T17:05:00.000Z	Thezanke		I have a 2.66 C2D and 4gigs ram... should I use 32 or 64 bit?
2008-04-22T17:05:00.000Z	Thezanke		(I am using linux for security, becoming a CEH)
2008-04-22T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 depends on what kind of work you want to do. and do you REALLy want to use all the ram.. you may be a little short on 32bit.
2008-04-22T17:06:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	Security things.. but I am also running 2x 8800GTX... Idk 64bit limitations on Linux
2008-04-22T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 You might want to stick to 32bit. for better driver compatiabity.  . running 'security things' on a machine aith $500+ In video cards? heh heh...
2008-04-22T17:07:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	haha well, I am in class for A+ Net+ CCNA MCSE CEH and CHFI... Gaming is just my hobby
2008-04-22T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 and that pc also serves as a space heater!
2008-04-22T17:08:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	haha.. I bought the biggest case I could and put 3x more fans in it than it came with
2008-04-22T17:09:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	and it sits by a window AC
2008-04-22T17:10:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	swap size? I DO use things like VMWare and Compiz-fusion (being a gamer I enjoy eye candy)
2008-04-22T17:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 you can always add more swap partiion/files later if you want. I only enable about 512mb swap partition on 'every' hard drive i have in a machine. :)
2008-04-22T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 should be enough - you may never even use any of it.
2008-04-22T17:13:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	hope I dont Auto-Standby
2008-04-22T17:13:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	I was told you need to have Sawp = Ram if you go into standby
2008-04-22T17:13:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	so it can back up the ram to it
2008-04-22T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 if you are planing on using Hibernate/suspend you will.
2008-04-22T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 but why use that on a desktopp machine. :0
2008-04-22T17:14:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	Probably wont lol
2008-04-22T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 of couse the suspend/hibernate stuff has its OWN set of issues.
2008-04-22T17:14:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	how are the drivers for this space heater? last time the 8800 was iffy.. and II've gotten a 2nd one since then
2008-04-22T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 my 8800gtsxxx = works fine.
2008-04-22T17:15:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	awesome
2008-04-22T17:25:00.000Z	Thezanke	Dr_willis	able to run SLI? or is that a nono?
2008-04-22T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thezanke	 i hear the drivers can do sli.. but  ive never used sli. I find it a bit on the overkill/useless side.
