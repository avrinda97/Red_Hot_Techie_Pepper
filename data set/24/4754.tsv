2007-02-06T13:05:00.000Z	SecrethX		how can I enlarge my /? (home is on another partition) I just found out I have 40G of unallocated space and I want to enlarge my /, im on the live cd backing up /  anyone?
2007-02-06T13:07:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	I think there is a disk utility that allows you to change the size of partitions. I don't remember the name. You have the right idea about backing up though. It's reccomended to back stuff up before you go messing with partitions.
2007-02-06T13:11:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	how did you find out you have unallocated space?
2007-02-06T13:12:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	I remembered it.. I forgot about the unallocated space when I was installing ;O
2007-02-06T13:14:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	you can check it with gparted
2007-02-06T13:15:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	hmm. The command gparted in my terminal didn't do anything.
2007-02-06T13:15:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	sudo apt-get install gparted
2007-02-06T13:17:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	thank you. *chuckles* I find that error message funny, for when you try to run it without root.
2007-02-06T13:17:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	haha, yes
2007-02-06T13:19:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	hmm. I do have three partitions. /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2, and dev/hda5. Hm... 5 is under 2. Are they the same thing?
2007-02-06T13:20:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	what filesystems?
2007-02-06T13:23:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	doesnt matter then, the extended holds the swap so you basicly have one big partition and one swap (someone correct me if Im wrong)
2007-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	yes, it appears to hold the swap. Is it okay that I don't have seperate partitions for home and /?
2007-02-06T13:25:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	well, its better if home and / are on different partitions, for like a crash you only need to overwrite / and so home gets saved but it isnt really needed
2007-02-06T13:26:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	ah, okay. I suppose that is useful, but oh well. It's too late now.
2007-02-06T14:30:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	lol. If you have a burner you can just burn an ubuntu CD for yourself.
2007-02-06T14:30:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	but then i need to download it again ;)
2007-02-06T14:32:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	it'll have you restart and then it'll boot from that program I think. I don't remember what it said when I read that page. But if you want to delete the partition your windows is on, I don't think you'll be able to since the exe will be running off of that partition. If you want to wipe everything when you install, you'll need to boot from something that isn't on the hard drive methinks.
2007-02-06T14:33:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	I just installed windows ;) I want a multiOS just so my parents wont harras me minute after minute ;)
2007-02-06T14:36:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	Ah, I know how that is. How sad it is that we must support our computer illiterate relatives by placing the evil windows on our systems. You'd think ubuntu itself would be easy enough for people to use. My sister can use it with no problems, once I set up a few things for her like launchers for firefox and GAIM on her desktop. For my mom and her boyfriend, I still have my older windows computer. This comp is pure
2007-02-06T14:36:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	well, windows comes in handy when it comes to playing games that I always used to play :)
2007-02-06T14:37:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	SecrethX	that's true. There's also Wine though. Alot of windows things work when you install/run them under that.
2007-02-06T14:38:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	I know, but WineCVS.sh script just wont compile cedega cvs :( dunno why though need to look into that, but hell, now my parents are satisfied :).
2007-02-06T14:39:00.000Z	SecrethX	AmaroqWolf	I just found the cd :) see ya in a bit :)
