2008-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	ahave		trying to configure my wifi usb adapter... what is my next step after i obtain the chipset?
2008-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	are you using ndiswrapper?
2008-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	idk. how can i tell?
2008-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	from whatever directions you are following
2008-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	i do not have directions..
2008-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	which is why i am here
2008-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	thx
2008-02-08T08:30:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	ndiswrapper is for using windows drivers?
2008-02-08T08:31:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	my card is supposed to linux capable :  http://www.data-alliance.net/servlet/the-90/high-dsh-power-long-dsh-range-AWUS036H-Alfa/Detail
2008-02-08T08:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	well, if it worked in linux, then I think it would already be working.  and yes, ndiswrapper is about using the windows drivers in linux
2008-02-08T08:33:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	it has worked previously on another ubuntu box i once had.. just not now.
2008-02-08T08:33:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	is there no other way than without ndiswrapper?
2008-02-08T08:34:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	i would rather not use a wrapper and just use it natively
2008-02-08T08:34:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	well of course, native will always be better than ndiswrapper.  Have you installed linux-modules-restricted?  or checked the restricted driver manager maybe?
2008-02-08T08:35:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	restricted driver manager? no. what is that?
2008-02-08T08:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	from a terminal, run restricted-manager
2008-02-08T08:37:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	command not found
2008-02-08T08:37:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	it should be known i have a linuxICE build of ubuntu so perhaps this is not included?
2008-02-08T08:39:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	yeah, that would do it
2008-02-08T08:39:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	what's lspci | grep Ethernet        say?
2008-02-08T08:40:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	nothing
2008-02-08T08:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	so this is linux in your car?
2008-02-08T08:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	ahave	I don't know about your problem though, I would try this (ndiswrapper): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/RTL8180L?highlight=%28WifiDocs%2FDevice%29
2008-02-08T08:43:00.000Z	ahave	danbhfive	as soon as i get everything working. yes
