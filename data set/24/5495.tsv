2012-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: let me try
2012-09-06T12:25:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: thank you :)
2012-09-06T12:26:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	np
2012-09-06T12:35:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	rephrase
2012-09-06T12:35:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: i want to reinstall ubuntu
2012-09-06T12:36:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	and what do you mean now with 'is there a stable release ...'?
2012-09-06T12:41:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	i think you dont get it - 12.04 is the current stable - so you can either (not recommended) us some old ubuntu version - or (recommended) try to fix your issues instead of just doing a random reinstall
2012-09-06T12:43:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: okay
2012-09-06T12:44:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	so was that crash reproduceable?
2012-09-06T12:47:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: when i restart i see for just glance a error ( i know it's error by the red color ) can you help me to find out what is that error ?

2012-09-06T12:53:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: are you there ?
2012-09-06T12:57:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	you might check the output of dmesg
2012-09-06T12:57:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	or just use a real boot-process without gui-hiding some relevant informations
2012-09-06T12:58:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	so ask yourself again - why do you want to reinstall your comp?
2012-09-06T12:58:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: okay . where can i find dmesg
2012-09-06T13:03:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	dmesg is a terminal command - grub controls your boot-paramter and controls like that if you are using a silent boot or whatever else
2012-09-06T13:03:00.000Z	fidel	lenovo	in general - try to focus on the channel - and not a single user inhere - and i still dont get why you want to reinstall at all... but i give up now anyways ...have other things to do
2012-09-06T13:05:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: sorry , i cancel the reinstall idea ( after you words ) now i want to fix the error only :)
2012-09-06T13:08:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: i execute the command "dmesg" where shall i but the output ?
2012-09-06T13:10:00.000Z	lenovo	fidel	: never mind
