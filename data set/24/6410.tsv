2006-05-27T12:10:00.000Z	mehmet	r0xoR	No
2006-05-27T12:10:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	do you have either links or lynx installed?
2006-05-27T12:10:00.000Z	mehmet	r0xoR	i dont have links
2006-05-27T12:11:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	do you have lynx then?
2006-05-27T12:11:00.000Z	mehmet	r0xoR	: lynx? u mean linux?
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	no i mean what i said
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	lynx
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	sudo apt-get install lynx
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	mehmet		r0xor no i dont have it
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	r0xoR		links requires many libs (iirc)
2006-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	r0xoR		lynx does not
2006-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	you can do it the risky way and use easyubuntu
2006-05-27T12:13:00.000Z	r0xoR	mehmet	or you can do it the "hard" way and compile yourself a kernel
