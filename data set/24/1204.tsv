2011-02-24T19:25:00.000Z	Provenzano		I can't run my ubuntu. when I run my pc, it says there are no partitions. I try to use a live cd, however my ubuntu partition has been desappeared. what can I do?
2011-02-24T19:27:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Boot to a liveCD and see what is there, (or not there as the case may be).
2011-02-24T19:28:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	windows partition are there. however ubuntu no. can I recover it?
2011-02-24T19:31:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	: ls : cannot access /chroot no such file or directorie
2011-02-24T19:31:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	df | pastebinit
2011-02-24T19:32:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	I thought you just said they were in /chroot ?
2011-02-24T19:33:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	where can I see /chroot? I'm a little noob
2011-02-24T19:33:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Sorry, I confused  you with another.      But if I were  you, I'd boot to a liveCD and see what is there, (or not there as the case may be).
2011-02-24T19:35:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	and compdoc, on disk utility my ubuntu partition has been marked as free. swap appear correctly
2011-02-24T19:40:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Was this  previously a dual boot system?
2011-02-24T19:40:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Does MS Windows boot now?
2011-02-24T19:41:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	grub is not working. it says there are no partitions, and I can't start OS
2011-02-24T19:41:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Can you boot to MS Windows?
2011-02-24T19:41:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	no, cause grub open first
2011-02-24T19:42:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	I suggest you  boot to a liveCD and see what is there, (or not there as the case may be).
2011-02-24T19:42:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Do you have a linux CD?
2011-02-24T19:43:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	sudo fdisk -l
2011-02-24T19:43:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
2011-02-24T19:44:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	pastebinit is not installed
2011-02-24T19:45:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Use http://paste.ubuntu.com if you can not use pastebinit
2011-02-24T19:48:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/571757/
2011-02-24T19:50:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	You are correct in thinking he deleted your Linux partition.  Looks like all that's left is the 2G swap partition.
2011-02-24T19:51:00.000Z	usr13_	Provenzano	Not much left to do but re-install.
2011-02-24T19:51:00.000Z	Provenzano	usr13_	ok. thanks ;)
