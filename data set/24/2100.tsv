2012-10-31T20:33:00.000Z	svip		root can play sound, but I cannot.  Is some process stealing my sound device?
2012-10-31T20:34:00.000Z	vfw	svip	What error do you get?
2012-10-31T20:34:00.000Z	svip	vfw	None, just no sound.
2012-10-31T20:35:00.000Z	vfw	svip	play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*
2012-10-31T20:35:00.000Z	vfw	svip	... and tell us what errors you get.
2012-10-31T20:36:00.000Z	svip	vfw	Indeed; no sound.  But if I put sudo in front, plenty of sound.
2012-10-31T20:36:00.000Z	vfw	svip	... or paste it if it's more than one line.
2012-10-31T20:36:00.000Z	vfw	svip	did you issue the above command as normal user?  If so, what error did you get?
2012-10-31T20:37:00.000Z	vfw	svip	pastebinit
2012-10-31T20:37:00.000Z	svip	vfw	I use aplay.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1321234/
2012-10-31T20:44:00.000Z	vfw	svip	Looks like it played without error.  Run alsamixer and see if anything is turned down or muted.
2012-10-31T20:44:00.000Z	svip	vfw	There isn't.  But since it works with root, can I not already confirm that?
2012-10-31T20:47:00.000Z	svip	vfw	Users don't have different sound channel levels in my experience, at least not in alsamixer.
2012-10-31T20:49:00.000Z	vfw	svip	play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav 2>&1 |pastebinit  #And send resulting URL
2012-10-31T20:49:00.000Z	vfw	svip	Or:  play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/* 2>&1 |pastebinit  #And send resulting URL

2012-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	vfw	svip	As you can see, it is playing.  Did you run alsamixer?
2012-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	svip	vfw	Yes.
2012-10-31T20:53:00.000Z	vfw	svip	It is playing, you are just not hearing anything from the speakers.  I dont' know why but that is what is happening.
2012-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	svip	vfw	o_O wtf.  Alsa required side to be unmuted.
2012-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	vfw	svip	Look at alsamixer window and see that nothing is muted or turned down. (MM at bottom of a channel means it is mutted and m toggles mute on or off).
2012-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	svip	vfw	Well, at least, now it is working.  Thanks for the help anyway.  I just did not think I needed side or surround as I haven't needed those in the past.
2012-10-31T20:55:00.000Z	vfw	svip	move from one channel to another with the right or left arrows.  m  will toggle muting on or off.
2012-10-31T20:56:00.000Z	vfw	svip	When you have no sound, first check to see if it is just muted or turned down.  [For future reference.]
