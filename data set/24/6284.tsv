2006-01-10T09:25:00.000Z	brenner		anyone familiar with grub errors? i'm getting "error 29: disk write error" when i try and boot into xp.  breezy boots fine
2006-01-10T09:25:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	disk _write_ error?
2006-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	you are sure it's from grub?
2006-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	i'm presuming it is
2006-01-10T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	don't presume.  You should be able to tell, though.  You don't see any windows boot up on the screen, I take it?
2006-01-10T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	I don't know, but grub doesn't try to write
2006-01-10T09:27:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	oh ok.
2006-01-10T09:28:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	well, when i select xp, it shows the grub entry, and then that one error line below
2006-01-10T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	that would appear to be coming from grub.  Let me see if grub actually does write.
2006-01-10T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	you haven't made any configuration changes at the grub prompt, just a normal boot and select windows?
2006-01-10T09:30:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	hang on.  you were probably right the 1st time.  i tried removing grub using fixmbr off the xp cd, and i got "error loading operating system" when i rebooted
2006-01-10T09:30:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	not a good sign
2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	i've read some forum topics, and they suggest [1]  disabling bios protection or [2]  running checkdisk off the xp cd
2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	you can try running checkdisk.  It can't hurt.  The odds aren't good, but try it anyway
2006-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	not even sure what they mean about disabling bios protection
2006-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	i've never run checkdisk before. :) is it equivalent to scandisk?
2006-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	it's equivalent to unix fsck
2006-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	oh, ok
2006-01-10T09:34:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	yes, that's correct, about moving a directory
2006-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	I don't think the file system is really corrupted
2006-01-10T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	I think something was deleted
2006-01-10T09:36:00.000Z	brenner	sethk	by the ubuntu install?
2006-01-10T09:36:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	I don't know
2006-01-14T12:05:00.000Z	sethk	brenner	that's odd, I installed that a couple of days ago without a problem.
