2011-08-10T15:01:00.000Z	WaltherFI		Hm. Still trying to figure my grub2 around, there's no /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2011-08-10T15:02:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	the file to edit is /etc/default/grub, /boot/grub/grub.cfg is an automatically generated file
2011-08-10T15:03:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	yes, but i do need the generated file as in i have to check the exact name of the windows entry to set it as default
2011-08-10T15:04:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	and you don't have a grub.cfg file ? Are you sure you're running grub 2 ?
2011-08-10T15:05:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	Just reinstalled it after windows recovery wiped the MBR, reinstalled with the boot-repair as suggested
2011-08-10T15:05:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	though, trying to run update-grub2 produces an error now
2011-08-10T15:05:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	did you run update-grub ?
2011-08-10T15:05:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	what error ?
2011-08-10T15:06:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	on a natty liveusb, and you can techbabble at me, long time linux user
2011-08-10T15:08:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	how did you install grub2 ?
2011-08-10T15:08:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	did you install the grub-pc package ?
2011-08-10T15:09:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	again, this is my dad's computer running 10.10. After an update to windows failed, the MBR was wiped/recovered via the Windows recovery cd and grub wiped out. I asked for recovery help here, boot-repair app was recommended, used that.
2011-08-10T15:12:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	try installing the grub-pc package then running update-grub again
2011-08-10T15:14:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	brb, trying to boot
2011-08-10T15:20:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	No grub, no luck
2011-08-10T15:22:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	you don't get to grub at all, or you get to grub console ?
2011-08-10T15:23:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	nothing at all. Boots to windows.
2011-08-10T15:23:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	apparently the boot-repair isn't working
2011-08-10T15:24:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	then I suggest you rerun grub installation from the live CD, following that guide : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2011-08-10T15:25:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	i was wondering if the old-skool style was still possible :)
2011-08-10T15:25:00.000Z	glebihan	WaltherFI	ok source it is :)
2011-08-10T15:25:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	i've fixed the grub1 a couple of times with chroot, familiar with it
2011-08-10T15:28:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	any ideas? chroot: failed to run command `/bin/bash': Exec format error
2011-08-10T15:30:00.000Z	WaltherFI	glebihan	bah, wasted too much time on this. I'll just download the natty iso and reinstall the thing, faster than trying to fix grub and upgrade
