2009-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	cos this apt has super cow powers
2009-06-06T05:25:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	just click on him
2009-06-06T05:25:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	i did and he left lol
2009-06-06T05:32:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	killall gnome-panel will get rid of him
2009-06-06T05:33:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	your panel will return automatically, worry not
2009-06-06T05:34:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	yeah i read that on a forum but i thought my panel would not come back so i was looking for another way :P
2009-06-06T05:35:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	https://launchpad.net/~kow/+archive/ppa
2009-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	that ppa has a fixed vlc in it
2009-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	wow cool, thanks
2009-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	is it beta or something, that's why it's not released on ubuntus repo?
2009-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	no promises on its stability, I think he just reverted some of the changes canonical made to the upstream source (so it's not as integrated at the expense of video in on one window)
2009-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	what's kow?
2009-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	kow is the guy's username
2009-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	LordKow  on network irc.freenode.net if you want to talk to him
2009-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	nah just wondering
2009-06-06T05:40:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	so how would i install it after adding the key and to sources list i mean first i would remove the vlc i have now but then to install
2009-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	after adding the repo, it will appear as an update to vlc, so just do the update
2009-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	ohh ok cool just update, so when a new version appears on the default ubuntu ones i would just update again right?
2009-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	yep
2009-06-06T05:43:00.000Z	boss_mc	mib_csj1b03z	his versions are designed to be 'between' official releases
2009-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	ok yeah i got what u mean now, but let's say i wnated to update first i would run sudo apt-get update, but then let's say i wanted to install updates without using update manager what command would i run?
2009-06-06T05:49:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	upgrade :)
2009-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	boss_mc	ok, works now :D thanks
