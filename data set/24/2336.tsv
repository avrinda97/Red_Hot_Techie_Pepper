2010-05-19T10:24:00.000Z	gartral	IdleOne	i explained why i swore.. besides, i deal with kids and people from age 4+ who say every swear word known to man
2010-05-19T10:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	gartral	sorry after the fact does not excuse it. the fact that you took time to excuse yourself means you knew it was wrong. meaning you had the time to think about what you were doing and still chose to break the rules. as for the kids and people you work with. I don't care and if they come here and swear I will kick them also :)
2010-05-19T10:27:00.000Z	gartral	IdleOne	and would you not use the same language in reference to the former president of the united states? im sorry, but there are exceptions to every rule, the last time there wasnt, we had the USSR.
2010-05-19T10:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	gartral	there are no exceptions to the rule here
2010-05-19T10:27:00.000Z	gartral	IdleOne	there are exceptions to every rule, everywhere. Period.
2010-05-19T10:49:00.000Z	gartral	IdleOne	in ANY case.. the commands you gave me have not let me connect to gimp.org's irc backend, and im subsequently discommunicated from the empathy group.
2010-05-19T11:21:00.000Z	gartral	IdleOne	do you know much about the internal workings of empathy?
2010-07-16T17:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	gartral	turn off caps from the laptop
