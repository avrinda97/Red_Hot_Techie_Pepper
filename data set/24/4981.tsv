2006-11-22T11:27:00.000Z	phrontist		hello! The easyubuntu server is down, any ideas on how I can get it?
2006-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	sn9	phrontist	are you installing 6.06 or 6.10?
2006-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	of what?
2006-11-22T11:28:00.000Z	sn9		ubuntu
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist		I think I can install the packages myself, shame easyubuntu is down though
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	sn9	phrontist	did you want easyubuntu for 6.06 or 6.10 of ubuntu?
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist		it makes things so pleasant
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	how do I check version?
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist		this is a fresh install from one of the free CDs
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	sn9		dapper or edgy?
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist		dapper
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	sn9		dapper is 6.06
2006-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	phrontist		okay
2006-11-22T11:31:00.000Z	sn9		for 6.06, instead of easyubuntu, look at the following URL:

2006-11-22T11:33:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	thanks!
2006-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	what did that do, exactly?
2006-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	phrontist		I don't seem to have easyubuntu...
2006-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	sn9	phrontist	the next messages in that mailing list thread talk about what it does
2006-11-22T11:36:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	wow, that is magic
2006-11-22T11:37:00.000Z	sn9	phrontist	easier than easyubuntu. now i just need to update it for edgy...
2006-11-22T11:38:00.000Z	phrontist	sn9	after restarting firefox, I still don't seem to have flash though
2006-11-22T11:39:00.000Z	sn9	phrontist	it installs flash 7. i've been contemplating changing it to install flash 9 instead
