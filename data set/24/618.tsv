2011-05-04T14:14:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	sudo is what we use to change the system in any way. It stands for super user. Usually, it has the same password as your user account.
2011-05-04T14:15:00.000Z	bison	chrisbster	ok copy that. tnx
2011-05-04T14:16:00.000Z	bison	chrisbster	agpgart
2011-05-04T14:24:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	I wasn't here for a description of your error, what's going on?
2011-05-04T14:46:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	Am i correct in assuming you are using a different computer for IRC than for the fix?
2011-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	bison	chrisbster	im using a dffrnt pc
2011-05-04T14:49:00.000Z	bison	chrisbster	have no name!@bison-desktop:~$
2011-05-04T14:57:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	put 'sudo' in front of that command
2011-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder oh oh
2011-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder have him change his user
2011-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder What does whoami return?
2011-05-04T15:02:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder He's nobody right now
2011-05-04T15:03:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder Now we can make some progress
2011-05-04T15:04:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder Type whoami again
2011-05-04T15:05:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder OK, we are going to (dare i say it) log you in as root
2011-05-04T15:05:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder I promised myself I would never do this...
2011-05-04T15:07:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder bison, logout and login with the name 'root' and the password as your user password
2011-05-04T15:07:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder that's what I was guessing
2011-05-04T15:08:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder since he doesn't have extensive knowledge of a Unix environment, I was assuming he was using the defaults
2011-05-04T15:13:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder We might have to talk him through that
2011-05-04T15:14:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder But I need to get some sleep. You need some more help on here celthunder. I'll try and come back a different time
2011-05-04T15:14:00.000Z	chrisbster	bison	celthunder Night!
