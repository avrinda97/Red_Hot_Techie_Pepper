2006-10-08T07:09:00.000Z	simpla		does any one know if linux doesn't quite support my laptop (ie ACPI etc), is it possible that it could over heat?
2006-10-08T07:10:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	all cpus come with fan elements designed to keep them cool enough for operation even under 100% load all the time
2006-10-08T07:10:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	so no chance unless you have shitty hardware
2006-10-08T07:10:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	so it doesn't matter that there is no software support?
2006-10-08T07:11:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	no, what it will do is eat up your battery because it won't know HOW to shut off unnecessary hardware
2006-10-08T07:11:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	all that will happen is the fan will run all the time
2006-10-08T07:12:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	oh ok.  Do you know of any links or info that I could start looking up, to figure out to give it support?
2006-10-08T07:12:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	honestly, google is really your #1 resources
2006-10-08T07:12:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	ubuntu wiki and forums are your #2 resource
2006-10-08T07:13:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	yeah have been trying that, not much luck.  Any how thanks for your help!  I will keep looking.
2006-10-08T07:13:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	chance of anyone here really having enough experience with your hardware is not very high
2006-10-08T07:13:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	no problemo
2006-10-08T07:14:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	yeah I figured that, as there isn't much info on it regarding any linux.. :(  but thought I would try anyhow.
2006-10-08T07:14:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	just out of curiosity, what laptop model?
2006-10-08T07:14:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	Acer Travelmate 5614WMSi
2006-10-08T07:16:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	funny thing is, lol, I did the dvd restore disk creation.  Then formatted etc to try linux.  Disappointed with linux, so tried to put the restore back on, and unfortunately find out that the dvd didn't burn properly :( lol.  So I guess back to linux and just bare with it
2006-10-08T07:16:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	well get a windows source cd and just reinstall ... the sticky on the bottom has all the info you need
2006-10-08T07:17:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	yeah I tried that, but the serial number on the sticker won't work in it.  Comes up invalid serial.  I was reading that there is a difference between the retail Xp Pro, and the OEM version that comes preinstalled.  The serials don't work with each other.
2006-10-08T07:18:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	really?
2006-10-08T07:18:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	yep
2006-10-08T07:18:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	well thats the weirdest way to get a new user of linux but ... well ... welcome :)
2006-10-08T07:19:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	lol.  Well I am using ubuntu on my desktop pc.  Havent' used windows for a little while actually.  Was hoping to do the same on the laptop
2006-10-08T07:20:00.000Z	holycow	simpla	there is a laptop compatability list on the wiki, check your laptop against that.  in terms of getting acpi to work, you may need to google and learn to compile and get it to work manually
2006-10-08T07:20:00.000Z	simpla	holycow	yeah its not in the list.  and yep will search for that now.
