2009-05-24T01:15:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Hello guys when I built this PC I installed 9.04 and everything works great, I couldnt be happier except a mouse lockup issue.I just went and bought a copy of Doom3 to play on my Ubuntu setup and it runs fantastic.However there is an occasional mouse lockup at seemingly random times.Yesterday it never locked up once and i played for hours.Today I booted and not even 3 mins go by and the mouse locked up.When i use the keyboard strokes to
2009-05-24T01:16:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Also ever since I installed 9.04 it has an error on bootup about a referenced package not found or something.It goes away realy fast but ui think it has to do with ACPI.By mobo wont let me disable that so Im not sure exactly what the message is or how to fix it.Can anyone take the time to help diagbose this?

2009-05-24T01:18:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Ctl ALT Del and lrestart is what i have been doing
2009-05-24T01:20:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Does that pastebin of my dmesg help any? Im not sure what to look for there.
2009-05-24T01:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		What should my BIOS be set to as far as PNP OS? That just get enabled for Windows only?Or do I enable that for Ubuntu as well? (I dont use Windows.)
2009-05-24T01:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	are you familiar with boot options ?
2009-05-24T01:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	yeah
2009-05-24T01:24:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	as a possible suggestion, you could try booting with pci=noacpi
2009-05-24T01:26:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	you could reference here for common boot options: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Common%20Boot%20Options
2009-05-24T01:29:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	if you scroll up that page, it will tell you how to add temporary/permanent boot options. Just remember 'pci=noacpi', reboot, try it, see if it works. If it does then make it permanent. If it doesn't, you can come back here and someone may look into it further.
2009-05-24T01:39:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	gnome log viewer will show all messages
2009-05-24T01:39:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	ibuclaw	Great is that a command on the CLI or is it in the menus somewhere?
2009-05-24T01:39:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	System->Administration->Log File Viewer
2009-05-24T01:40:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	alternately, less /var/log/messages
2009-05-24T01:40:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	and dmesg will show alot of useful kernel messages too.
2009-05-24T01:41:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	ibuclaw	Is there a place that i can see all the boot options like you mentioned so i can see them all and know my options? such as the pci=noacpi sp?
2009-05-24T01:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	I suppose O'Reilly's Linux Kernel in a nutshell has a good list: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch09.pdf
2009-05-24T01:45:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	ibuclaw	Thank you
2009-05-24T01:46:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	the Ubuntu Help documentation should be sufficient enough though. You don't really need to ever stray beyond the most common options.
2009-05-24T01:46:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	ibuclaw	What log should i be checking to see that error message that appears before the desktop comes up? I cant find it so far.
2009-05-24T01:51:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	ibuclaw	Ok thank you very much for helping me.Have a good one!
2009-05-24T01:52:00.000Z	ibuclaw	linuxguy2009	ACPI is quite common actually on certain machines. I can't seem to see any specific fix on your [Reference] issue though.
