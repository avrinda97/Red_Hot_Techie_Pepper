2007-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	pawan		what is the difference between the two
2007-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	pawan		i am using ubuntu
2007-07-30T14:57:00.000Z	pawan		now i am also installing kubuntu
2007-07-30T14:57:00.000Z	pawan		might be some difference
2007-07-30T14:57:00.000Z	avis	pawan	you can install both by sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-07-30T14:58:00.000Z	avis	pawan	you'd switch between the two in your login manager
2007-07-30T15:00:00.000Z	avis	pawan	well no need to install on another partition when you can swtich between gnome and KDE from the login manager
2007-07-30T09:02:00.000Z	avis	pawan	its all up to what you prefer.  i've always liked gnome but for every gnome user you will find many others that like kde
2007-07-30T09:03:00.000Z	avis	pawan	if you are feeling experiemental another one to try us XFCE which is the xubuntu-desktop package
2007-07-30T09:04:00.000Z	avis	pawan	apt-get install xubuntu-desktop.  and to switch between different environments you'd change at the login manager
2007-07-30T09:08:00.000Z	avis	pawan	i dont think you need mint.  mint uses gnome just like ubuntu.  you'd best find one you like and stick to it
2007-08-01T05:33:00.000Z	avis	pawan	thats ok.  i lose at tic tac toe
2007-08-01T10:13:00.000Z	avis	pawan	this is what fixes what i believe to be the same problem for msudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals
2007-08-01T10:13:00.000Z	avis	pawan	that was a sudo not a msudo
2007-08-01T10:14:00.000Z	avis	pawan	you are getting a white screen ?  that happened to me, and i believe that is the fix
2007-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	avis	pawan	i believe nvidia-xconfig is a part of nvidia-glx  you can add it manually too let me see the output of my xorg.conf
2007-08-01T10:17:00.000Z	avis	pawan	i dont seem to have that anymore, apparently no need for it since i use envy ubuntu package to compile the latest nvidia driver and a new kernel
2007-08-01T10:20:00.000Z	avis	pawan	i am so dumb i will issue the command so that it will alter my xorg.conf and paste what to add
2007-08-01T10:22:00.000Z	avis	pawan	make a backup of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then add this to the 'Section "Screen"' list --  Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
2007-08-01T10:23:00.000Z	avis	pawan	after backing up try adding that line that starts with Option "AddARG.. etc
2007-08-01T10:41:00.000Z	avis	pawan	where did you find 3dchess ?
2007-08-01T10:48:00.000Z	avis	pawan	did you get 3dchess working ?  if so, how ?
2007-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	avis	pawan	yes but how ?  i would like to play 3d chess sometime too
