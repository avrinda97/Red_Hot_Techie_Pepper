2007-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	ave you been in here and asked it before
2007-10-03T07:40:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	about 5 or 10 minutes ago, yea. havent gotten a reply  though.
2007-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	ahh, someone else asked this a week or so ago, we did a bit of research and it lookged like you needed for some hardware a different dvd drive, for the others you rneeded a propritary file system for the camera to read it
2007-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	I wondered if you where the same guy from before
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	no i wasnt.. heguru: thanks, ill give it a try
2007-11-15T22:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	write an icon theme
2007-11-22T17:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	means you probably have another package manager runnning
2007-11-22T17:45:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	i've restarted my pc several times, after also logging out and back in, and restarting X.
2007-11-22T17:46:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	and i cant seem to find one running in the system onitor
2007-11-22T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	your either not launching it as root or something else is using the lock file, have you looked at the file it is complaining about
2007-11-22T18:14:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	im not sure what file its complaining about. how can i find out?
2007-11-22T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	please paste the EXACT error message (into a pastebin if its long)
2007-11-22T18:16:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	Unable to get an exclusive lock. This usually means that another package management application (like apt-get or aptitude) already running. Please close that application first.
2007-11-22T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	I suspect you have a lock file remaining
2007-11-22T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	look in /var/cache/apt for a lock file
2007-11-22T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	I havn't got an ubuntu box handy to check so I'm working from memory
2007-11-22T18:17:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	there is 2 .bin files, and a directory called "archives"
2007-11-22T18:25:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock.. Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2007-11-22T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	there we go
2007-11-22T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	check for the file /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2007-11-22T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	close down all your package managers and remove that file
2007-11-22T18:28:00.000Z	Tarkus	ikonia	thanks a lot. works now
2007-11-22T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Tarkus	no problem
