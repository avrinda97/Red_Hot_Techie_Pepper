2009-06-01T11:53:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		really?
2009-06-01T11:53:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		/usr/sbin adduser?
2009-06-01T11:55:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		could i use my regular user to access via ftp?
2009-06-01T11:55:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		ssh access
2009-06-01T11:56:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		no gui lol
2009-06-01T11:57:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		i think a gui would slow it down..
2009-06-01T11:57:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		so vsftp does not manage users and home directories for ftp access only?
2009-06-01T11:59:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		for example, if i installed filezilla server on a windows machine, i use filezilla to set up users.. in vsftp, i go about this in a different way?
2009-06-01T12:00:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		this is all done through the config file, correct?
2009-06-01T12:02:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior		so use the "adduser" command?
2009-06-01T12:02:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	read vsftp document
2009-06-01T12:04:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	you didn't read carefully
2009-06-01T12:06:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior	whatvn	vsftp documentation says nothing about adding a user..
2009-06-01T12:07:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	user belongs to OS
2009-06-01T12:08:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	man adduser
2009-06-01T12:10:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior	whatvn	i read the man page as you suggested, but it says "if the directory does not exist, it will be created" which implies that if it does exist, it would use it..
2009-06-01T12:10:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	you dont need to create home directory for vsftp user
2009-06-01T12:13:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	you can access a website place in /var/www but website admin didn't create a home directory for you
2009-06-01T12:13:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	keep reading
2009-06-01T12:14:00.000Z	sup3rs3nior	whatvn	i think i missed something you said..
2009-06-01T12:15:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	you can create home directory for vsftp user, ie /var/www/vsftpuser1 for user1
2009-06-01T12:16:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	it depends on what permission you give for that user
2009-06-01T12:17:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	home directory is just a place for keeping user information, document...etc
2009-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	whatvn	sup3rs3nior	you must config vsftp to allow user to connect, what you did?
