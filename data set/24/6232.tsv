2006-08-15T10:55:00.000Z	erisco		good evening everyone, I have an issue regarding haulting ubuntu 6.06 and powering off the computer
2006-08-15T10:55:00.000Z	erisco		I will either use the GUI or manually type in halt -p
2006-08-15T10:55:00.000Z	erisco		however, the screen will nearly instantly turn black and the power is never turned offf
2006-08-15T10:56:00.000Z	erisco		I can't tell if ubuntu has safely halted or not, and it is still a bother with the power not turning off because then I have to pull the plug every time
2006-08-15T10:56:00.000Z	erisco		does anyone have an resources or knowledge of situations like this?
2006-08-15T10:56:00.000Z	erisco		I am thinking it is simply compatibility with my computer, which is an AMD
2006-08-15T10:57:00.000Z	erisco		not a 64 bit processor
2006-08-15T10:57:00.000Z	erisco		Windows on this computer (it dual boots) is completely capable of restarting and shutting off the computer
2006-08-15T10:57:00.000Z	erisco		unforunately ubuntu is not
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	erisco		can anyone help me here or am I wasting my time?
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman	erisco	it sounds like a problem with the power management on your machine
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman	erisco	check for a BIOS firmware update ?
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman		genpatton, well
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman		that might be an issue
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	erisco		dougsko:no
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman		not sure if you can do that with GRUB or not
2006-08-15T10:58:00.000Z	yossman		does anyone know, can grub install to hdd1 in the system and tell the system to boot from USB next?
2006-08-15T10:59:00.000Z	yossman		to help genpatton7
2006-08-15T10:59:00.000Z	erisco		yossman:Windows has no issue shutting off and restarting the computer. I think it would be compatibility between ubuntu and my power management, but not solely the power management
2006-08-15T10:59:00.000Z	yossman	erisco	so yea maybe ubuntu doesn't know your system's particular APM management
2006-08-15T10:59:00.000Z	yossman		genpatton, and it won't, no
2006-08-15T11:00:00.000Z	yossman	erisco	actually heh that might be it, if your system uses APM instead of ACPI that could be a problem
2006-08-15T11:00:00.000Z	erisco	gutano	yossman, so my solutions are to find what my APM management version or type is
2006-08-15T11:00:00.000Z	yossman	erisco	do a search on ubuntuforums.org for your motherboard
