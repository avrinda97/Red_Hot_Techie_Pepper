2011-03-18T03:29:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	 try ${HOSTNAME}_ldap_key ?
2011-03-18T03:30:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	nope... it doesn't recognize the variable and instead prints out just _ldap_key
2011-03-18T03:33:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	is this is bash?
2011-03-18T03:34:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	yeah, I just tried echoing $HOSTNAME from a test script and it apparently doesn't recognize the variable inside the script, but my system knows it
2011-03-18T03:36:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	You can set it explicitly with HOSTNAME=$(hostname -f) at the top of your script, then
2011-03-18T03:38:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	still not picking up my hostname... I'm seriously confused now. I thought that a script would inherit the variables of the parent shell that executed it
2011-03-18T03:40:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	yeah, I can echo my hostname of my FQDN with it, but the script doesn't catch it
2011-03-18T03:44:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	 when you say inside another variable, can you give an example?
2011-03-18T03:44:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	th0r: if you two are interested, here is my test script: http://pastebin.com/JtQCKCT1
2011-03-18T04:07:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	yeah... I've done it by hand like 5 times in the past week and I keep wiping it and redoing it trying to get it to play nicely with what I want it to do
2011-03-18T03:51:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	http://pastebin.com/jWweW6ZS
2011-03-18T03:53:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	worked like a charm. I guess I was trying to overcomplicate things
2011-03-18T03:54:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	I appreciate the help
2011-03-18T03:54:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	Very welcome, and good luck
2011-03-18T03:55:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	so looking at your script I guess my issue was that I need the squiggly brackets to use a variable within another, and the entire thing needs to be double quoted?
2011-03-18T03:56:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	The squiggles let bash pick out variable names,right
2011-03-18T03:58:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	okay, that makes sense. Nobody likes whitespace
2011-03-18T03:59:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	double quotes arund a syring mean vars should be substituted, single quotes mean to ignore them
2011-03-18T03:59:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	ahh... I wondered what the difference was between single and double
2011-03-18T04:02:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	and that is where my problem started... I question if I should even be playing around with scripting an entire server installation if I have a hard time getting something so simple to work...
2011-03-18T04:02:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	gotta start somewhere!
2011-03-18T04:03:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	bash
2011-03-18T04:04:00.000Z	cayne	ehw	yeah but if I make a mistake while setting up certificates, installing services and applications en masse, and the like I could imagine I would have a nightmare tracking down the bugs that will inevitably pop up
2011-03-18T04:05:00.000Z	ehw	cayne	True enough; otoh doing it all by hand each time can introduce other unexpectedness
