2008-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	you will need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2008-08-01T13:51:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	you may also need to add "evdev" to /etc/modules
2008-08-01T13:51:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	ctrl-X
2008-08-01T13:52:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	you can close when you see the $ prompt again
2008-08-01T13:54:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	enter
2008-08-01T13:56:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	maybe you originally typed x11 instead of X11
2008-08-01T13:57:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	close and start again
2008-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	adamw9678	sn9	from the instal?l
2008-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	i thought you already had the system installed
2008-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	sn9	adamw9678	i mean "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" again
