2011-10-18T04:22:00.000Z	JRandolph		You don't need that much swap
2011-10-18T04:23:00.000Z	JRandolph		That's a old rule of thum
2011-10-18T04:23:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	That's what i read about!
2011-10-18T04:23:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	If you have 1gig of swap you're fine
2011-10-18T04:24:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	I think it too.
2011-10-18T04:24:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	I'm don't exactly understand
2011-10-18T04:25:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	When my notebook wake up, the keyboard doesn't work.
2011-10-18T04:55:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	I'd still post it on the forums
2011-10-18T04:56:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Ok!
2011-10-18T04:57:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Do you think I have to do kernel downgrade?
2011-10-18T04:57:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	There should be some older kernels still installed
2011-10-18T04:58:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	'Cause I cleaned the hard  drive.
2011-10-18T04:58:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	It's on the grub menu
2011-10-18T05:00:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Are you using the 32 or 64 version?
2011-10-18T05:00:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	still think it may be the kernel
2011-10-18T05:01:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	The kernel to 32 and 64 are the same?
2011-10-18T05:02:00.000Z	JRandolph	Rogowski	The kernel is what handles the suspend
2011-10-18T05:02:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	And what you think I have to do?
2011-10-18T05:04:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	If I do the kernel's downgrade, works?
2011-10-18T05:05:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Linux MV 3.0.0-12-generic #20-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 7 14:56:25 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2011-10-18T05:07:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	I will try the downgrade.
2011-10-18T06:01:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Acho que posso conviver com esse problema.
2011-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	Sorry, wrong language.
2011-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	Rogowski	JRandolph	I think I can live with this little problem for now.
