2011-05-26T17:37:00.000Z	dionyssis75		any ideas anyone?
2011-05-26T17:37:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	did you try to boot with a CD
2011-05-26T17:38:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	that sounds like you made an error creating both
2011-05-26T17:39:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	aah, so it boots but the boot process fails?
2011-05-26T17:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	have you tried to use the save mode hit F4 during boot options
2011-05-26T17:44:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	when the usb stick boots you can open the options with F$ and choose save mode
2011-05-26T17:44:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	on both
2011-05-26T17:45:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	ON THE pc THAT MAKES PROBS
2011-05-26T17:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	another option is to disable kernel mode setting with nomodeset
2011-05-26T17:47:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	press F6 during boot screen
2011-05-26T17:48:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	from the usb
2011-05-26T17:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	so you have tried to boot the usb in save mode with nomdeset enabled?
2011-05-26T17:55:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	Again did you try to boot with nomdeset enabled and in save mode?
2011-05-26T17:59:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	yes and when you boot the usb stick hit F6 to set nomodeset and F4 to activate save mode and see if it boots then
2011-05-26T18:02:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	You mean you have a window box where before ubuntu was installed as well
2011-05-26T18:03:00.000Z	schnuffle	dionyssis75	rewrite you MBR
