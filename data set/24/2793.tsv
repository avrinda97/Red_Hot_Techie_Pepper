2008-08-18T06:35:00.000Z	hwilde	surger	I think you should get a better video card, or give up on compiz
2008-08-18T06:37:00.000Z	surger	hwilde	I'll get a new video card, I just wanted to try to make it work with what i got and save the money
2008-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	hwilde	surger	so turn off compiz fancy effects then
2008-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	hwilde	surger	you need probably atleast 128MB of ram
