2010-04-30T05:51:00.000Z	dominicdinada		I am having a problem on my laptop that when i am typing the cursor position jumps. sometimes back to the middle of the textbox and sometimes it goes to a whole new window is this a driver issue or a touchpad sensitivity issue or what could it be?

2010-04-30T05:55:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   hehe, well, same here,  but I think is my touchpad, since my pad lies around my hand's wrist, but yeah, is not driver or stuff, I guess I can always disable it :P
2010-04-30T05:55:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   I used to have it disabled, never ran into this... thus
2010-04-30T05:56:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   maybe you just need a mouse :P, they're cheap you know
2010-04-30T05:57:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	 that was not the question if i needed to go buy another mouse the sensitivity threshold just needs to be changed for my touchpad
2010-05-15T05:26:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   using kubuntu?  when?
2010-05-15T05:27:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	Well using Ubuntu ( considering i am in Ubuntu ) Browsing to network places ones that are saved via the places, connect to a network
2010-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   ... I see....... do you see a .DBUS... named file in ~?
2010-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	named .dbus yes
2010-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   well.... I get issues with the older intercommunication protocol, dcop, and usually the way I've resolved it is by deleting that file, and restarting my session, or loging out and back in, I usually boot to a console session, delete it, and reboot, is a so-called 'stale file', or file of a previous session that should have been deleted
2010-05-15T05:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   yea, the file is a symlink, you want to delete the actual file, no just the symlink
2010-05-15T05:34:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	that worked for the mapped location as of now... we will see if the problem finds it way back and then I will take a real look at why it wont let me store linked network drives...
2010-05-15T05:34:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	I deleted the file :)
2010-06-24T05:59:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	iTunes keeps all the files in a xml format... with randomly generated hashes for the coresponding file,author etc
2010-06-24T06:09:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	How else do people get the clue without pointing them out in a fashion that there is a problem
2010-06-24T06:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	   but just saying, I'd rather appreciate you keep it in the channel, politely, as opposed to rude
2010-06-24T06:10:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	:)
2010-06-27T05:38:00.000Z	Typos_King	dominicdinada	  pebkac, I've run win32 box just as well, in 14years or so, I may have gotten a whopping 5 or so malicious stuff,
2010-06-27T05:41:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	I get malicious stuff from websites and other things alike I just notice the signs and take care of it right away. I mean you dont drive your car until the engine seizes with out servicing it :D
2010-06-28T04:28:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	?  lol
2010-06-28T05:33:00.000Z	dominicdinada	Typos_King	: Vbox image via network ?
