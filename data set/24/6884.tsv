2005-06-22T07:43:00.000Z	nJess		im having a hard time connecting to anything from ubuntu (things keep timing out) but i have no problems on my windows machine on the same network, why would that happen?
2005-06-22T07:44:00.000Z	nJess		like for instance, i can connect to some irc servers with ease, others time out repeatedly
2005-06-22T07:45:00.000Z	nJess		things on the local network seem to be okay
2005-06-22T07:45:00.000Z	nJess		its just the internet thats acting up
2005-06-22T07:45:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	is it only irc?
2005-06-22T07:46:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	please try something else than irc and web too
2005-06-22T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	IRC lagging can be explained by not having an identd which currenyly most IRC servers require
2005-06-22T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	Open firefox and go to about:config. Now search for network.dns.disableIPV6 and set that value to true. Restart Firefox to see the effect.
2005-06-22T07:48:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	you might as well disable ipv6 completely, you can find out how on wiki.ubuntu.com
2005-06-22T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	no it's the same on both in this case
2005-06-22T07:59:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	for amd64 you'd better go to hoary
2005-06-22T08:00:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	really try hoary then
2005-06-27T11:49:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	try sudo ln -s /dev/hdc /dev/dvd (if hdc is your dvd player)
2005-06-27T11:51:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	nice :)
2005-06-27T11:52:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	is the cd drive listed in your /etc/fstab with the user and noauto options?
2005-06-27T11:54:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	can you please post your /etc/fstab to paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-06-27T11:54:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	/etc/fstab is a file
2005-06-27T11:56:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	if /dev/hdc is your cdrom drive (secondary slave), this looks good
2005-06-27T12:00:00.000Z	nJess	Seveas	i pasted fstab
2005-06-27T12:03:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	that all looks perfectly normal, what is the error you get?
2005-06-27T12:03:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	gdmflexiserver --xnest
2005-06-27T12:05:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	hmm, you should forget it anyway, nvm
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	mkfs can put a new filesystem on it (like format does on windows)
2005-07-29T11:03:00.000Z	Seveas	nJess	aptitude install nfs-kernel-server (nfs client is there already)
