2009-02-17T22:04:00.000Z	DPic		hey, can someone help me get japanese input working on my machine?
2009-02-17T22:06:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	what do you wish to use, SCIM or UIM?
2009-02-17T22:07:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	are the both included with ubuntu by default? i've been trying to use SCIM but whichever one you would recommend
2009-02-17T22:08:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	Let me check if my uim works on openoffice ...
2009-02-17T22:08:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	okay, thanks
2009-02-17T22:10:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	okay uim works on openoffice too. So I'm suggesting uim. there are situations where it doesn't work though. for example, in opera, you can't use it in ctrl-f, but you can use it everywhere else. and it also works on terminal, on firefox, etc etc
2009-02-17T22:10:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	let's go with uim
2009-02-17T22:10:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	what is the difference between the two?
2009-02-17T22:12:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	they work differently but users usually don't notice it. it's mostly how they interface with the apps. otherwise, they use the same engines (anthy, skk, canna, etc)
2009-02-17T22:12:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	and I always have scim work on one toolkit (i.e. gtk) and fail on another (i.e. qt)
2009-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	okay, so SCIM has started to work somehow and it was only needed for IM so i actually think i'm set
2009-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	so you have scim-anthy installed too?
2009-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	did you install via language support?
2009-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	i installed via language support, yeah
2009-02-17T22:14:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	okay, go to console and do this: im-switch -c
2009-02-17T22:14:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	and then select.... wait I forgot after that
2009-02-17T22:14:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	wait, why? SCIM is working
2009-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	really? so it needs no config?
2009-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	idk, guess not
2009-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	strange. last time it only worked when you logged in with japanese language. it didn't start automatically in english
2009-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	syockit		prob they fixed that huh
2009-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	DPic		well i'm using jaunty, maybe they made some improvements?
2009-02-17T22:16:00.000Z	DPic	syockit	anyways, thanks for the help!
2009-02-17T22:16:00.000Z	syockit	DPic	cool on bleeding edge huh. yeah, maybe they did
