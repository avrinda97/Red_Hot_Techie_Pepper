2010-03-03T12:57:00.000Z	tehbaut		someone refresh me on how to get to root again? thought it was su -i or something
2010-03-03T12:58:00.000Z	tehbaut		hmmm
2010-03-03T12:58:00.000Z	tehbaut		ah, yeah that last one worked
2010-03-03T12:58:00.000Z	tehbaut		I swear there was something with a -i though...
2010-03-03T13:00:00.000Z	tehbaut		sudo -i
2010-03-03T13:02:00.000Z	tehbaut		there is a difference in the two, jamieleshaw ...I just don't know what they are beyond the changing of location
2010-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	tehbaut		sudo -i takes you to root
2010-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	tehbaut		er, not root... root's home
2010-03-03T13:03:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	su <enter> takes you to root
2010-03-03T13:04:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	type "su" in terminal
2010-03-03T13:04:00.000Z	tehbaut	MaarekStele	right, but that one requires the password
2010-03-03T13:04:00.000Z	tehbaut	MaarekStele	right, but this is a live cd
2010-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	try "ubuntu" for the live CD password
2010-03-03T13:05:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	is using LIVE CD
2010-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	tehbaut	MaarekStele	not the one
2010-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	the LIVE CD only gives you limited usage, no software installs
2010-03-03T13:11:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	is this on a Windows system that you are running the Live CD?
2010-03-03T13:12:00.000Z	tehbaut	MaarekStele	not any more :P
2010-03-03T13:12:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	then finish the install
2010-03-03T13:12:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	of Ubuntu and create a user
2010-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	option 2: pull the drive and put it in the other computer so you can access the boot files
2010-03-03T13:14:00.000Z	tehbaut	MaarekStele	I should be able to get to them fine with the live cd, shouldn't I?
2010-03-03T13:21:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	open applications and Ubuntu software center, look to see if  you can install anything from there
2010-03-03T13:31:00.000Z	MaarekStele	tehbaut	I ran into the same problem with the Live portion, I wonder if there's something you have to change in order to install software
