2007-10-29T05:14:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	i help you with networking. install sshd, then give me you ip, username, password, and the process id of Xorg :P
2007-10-29T05:15:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	i betcha can't help with my networking crap, but feel free, haha; it's random disconnects with wireless when it doesn't actually drop the connection, just stops traffic
2007-10-29T05:16:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	same here but with a ppp0
2007-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	bored out of my mind anything else to know about your network?
2007-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	is the AP seperate from the route/gateway?
2007-10-29T05:20:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	cable modem into a wrt-350n using WPA2 personal and stock network manager with the restricted drivers it suggested when I went to configure it
2007-10-29T05:20:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	hmm. does the issues occor to other computers on the network?
2007-10-29T05:21:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	not to my knowledge, my Vista x32 doesn't appear to suffer the same problems
2007-10-29T05:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	i mean on your comp (the one with the issue), if you access another comp on the net, does the same thing happen or only with the internet
2007-10-29T05:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	are the other computers wired or wireless
2007-10-29T05:23:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	got 3 total computers, one running Vistax64 hardwired upstairs, one running Vistax86 wireless downstairs, and this running Gutsy wireless downstairs, literally right next to the router
2007-10-29T05:24:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	and no other computer sufferes from it?
2007-10-29T05:24:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	correct
2007-10-29T05:24:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	haven't really tried accessing the other computers as it appears to be a problem just losing the connection to the router
2007-10-29T05:25:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	did you try running ubuntu on another comp? to see if it's ubuntu or the comp?
2007-10-29T05:26:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	not yet, and can't especially do it easily; the x64 upstairs is RAIDed and I haven't found a good way to install to it yet, though I want to, and doesn't have a wireless card, and the x86 downstairs isn't my comp, and thus isn't available for testing
2007-10-29T05:26:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	unless the liveCD has wireless support?
2007-10-29T05:27:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	should/might
2007-10-29T05:27:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	I'll try that tomorrow, but it's not a valid troubleshooting step for tonight, at least, sadly
2007-10-29T05:28:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	for the raid comp, if it's hardware raid (like has a array controller) you should be able to install
2007-10-29T05:29:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	it's technically RAID in the BIOS off of an ICH9R chipset, so I THINK it's hardware raid, but I've never found any real walkthrough of how to install to it
2007-10-29T05:29:00.000Z	Ashfire908	mjancaitis	hardware raid is transparent
2007-10-29T05:30:00.000Z	mjancaitis	Ashfire908	Evanlec: that's what I thought. I may invest in a PCI card, but who knows now
