2007-11-18T12:22:00.000Z	devilhan	ArthurArchnix	at one point, out of dumb luck, I was able to get to the command line, but still don't have permission to edit the /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base file, even when using sudo!
2007-11-18T12:24:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	devilhan	Do you have two computers? the broken one and one you can use and talk to us on?

2007-11-18T12:29:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	devilhan	Ndiswrapper is a hack. You should try the right way first. Then, if that fails, ndiswrapper.
2007-11-18T12:30:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	devilhan	And you should never, never use use ndiswrapper settings in your alsa.conf
2007-11-18T12:31:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	devilhan	Have you reinstalled, or are you using the livecd right now?
2007-11-18T12:32:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	devilhan	Do you know how to get those files off?
