2011-06-08T10:21:00.000Z	cordoval		is there a true way to suspend in ubuntu natty?
2011-06-08T10:22:00.000Z	cordoval		have the problem with hibernation been fixed?
2011-06-08T10:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	cordoval	define true.
2011-06-08T10:22:00.000Z	cordoval		I would like to freeze my windows openened and restore them exactly where I left it on starting up
2011-06-08T10:23:00.000Z	cordoval		my laptop does not have battery and I would like to shut it down but restore my windows and opened programs
2011-06-08T10:23:00.000Z	cordoval		any way to do that?
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		there must be a way to hibernate in ubuntu or to save all info into disk and then restart from that session right?
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		kind of like vbox does
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		it freezes the state of the machine
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		then saves it to disk
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		then restart
2011-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	cordoval		at the exact same point
2011-06-08T10:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	cordoval	6 months old but may be the answer, without a hack. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-January/002734.html
2011-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	cordoval	this hack. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/gnome-session-save.1.html
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval	nit-wit	i read first link
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval		it is not a solution just an explanation that it was dropped from natty
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval		hmm
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval		now reading the second link
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	cordoval	the second has a targz download.
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval		so when you said without hack that is really no solution
2011-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cordoval		so it is with hack
2011-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	cordoval		it does not say how to install it though, I got the targz now
2011-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	cordoval		decompressing ...
2011-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	cordoval	 don't really know to be honest I haven't needed that feature.
