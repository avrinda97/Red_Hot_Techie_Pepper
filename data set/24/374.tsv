2011-10-22T22:44:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	/etc/default/grub perhaps/
2011-10-22T22:44:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	huh what?
2011-10-22T22:45:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	you aren't clear in what you want. presumably you want to customize grub.cfg but your customization is being blown away. there are two places to make permanent customizations /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d
2011-10-22T22:46:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	then its /etc/default/grub
2011-10-22T22:46:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	what are you trying to tell me i do not udnerstand
2011-10-22T22:47:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2011-10-22T22:47:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	see that bit that says "quiet splash" and remember how you would make it "quiet splash noapic" do that here
2011-10-22T22:48:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	when you are done modifying that file, save and close, and run sudo update-grub
2011-10-22T22:50:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	"gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub" add noapic after "quiet splash" save and close. run sudo update-grub
2011-10-22T22:50:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	run what
2011-10-22T22:50:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	start with "gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub"
2011-10-22T22:51:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	what exactly am i to type after that esactlly after i save and close what exactly am i to type exactly
2011-10-22T22:51:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	after youve saved and closed "sudo update-grub"
2011-10-22T22:51:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	ok thanks will try :)
2011-10-22T22:52:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	by the way do you know how to inside ubuntu move the desktop bar from the top to the bottom in ubuntu 11.10 i cant figure it out
2011-10-22T22:53:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	no, its much harder to do that with unity/gnome3. the point is to have a more consistent user experience that works for everyone than to encourage lots of customizations
2011-10-22T22:54:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	the problem is that firefox close options are right next to the ubuntu buttons up to the right it gets problametic
2011-10-22T22:54:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	i mean to the left
2011-10-22T22:54:00.000Z	escott	MegaPie	you can try gnome-tweak-tool or unity-tweak-tool they might allow buttons to be moved around
2011-10-22T22:55:00.000Z	MegaPie	escott	anyway will try your grub think, thanks for your time
