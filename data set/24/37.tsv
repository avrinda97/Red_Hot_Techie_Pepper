2012-10-21T23:09:00.000Z	Theodoros	ikonia	what?
2012-10-21T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	never
2012-10-21T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	it will not get updated
2012-10-21T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	no, it won't
2012-10-21T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	it will stay on the same base kernel
2012-10-21T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	you may see something in back ports, but that's it
2012-10-21T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	there is no promise of back ports
2012-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	there is no promise of any back ports, it's an LTS release, so they will try to keep on the same base version
2012-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	there is no official time line or promise of backports
2012-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	Theodoros	ikonia	you keep saying that
2012-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	Theodoros	ikonia	but you don't know what you're talking about
2012-10-21T23:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	because you keep asking
2012-10-21T23:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	please show me the official page that says "we promise to do backports and here is our time lines"
2012-10-21T23:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	yeah, where is the promise of backport and timeline ?
2012-10-21T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	yes, they will provide kernels, I've seen that page before, doesn't mean there is a promise to do this in a set time, especially if there are problems
2012-10-21T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	I'd assume they try to do it within the timelines of the release they are back porting
2012-10-21T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	not if there is a problem with it or a technical reason not to
2012-10-21T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	there isn't an official one
2012-10-21T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	that's the point,
2012-10-21T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	where is the official schedule then ?
2012-10-21T23:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	if you know there is a schedule, why are you asking what ti is ?
2012-10-21T23:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	there is no "we will give you $X $Y weeks after release"
2012-10-21T23:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Theodoros	I'd assume as soon as technical possible, tested and safe
