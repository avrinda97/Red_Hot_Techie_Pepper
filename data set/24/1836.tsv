2009-11-01T19:03:00.000Z	jiohdi		since there is no registry per se in linux... why can't I just run installed 9.04 binaries under 9.10?
2009-11-01T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	shared libraries
2009-11-01T19:03:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	so its a matter of dependencies?
2009-11-01T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	yes
2009-11-01T19:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	probably; but what are you exactly trying to do ?
2009-11-01T19:05:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	avoid reinstalling all the binaries that are on a different partition from 9.04
2009-11-01T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	you want to use the programs installed on a 9.04 root partition in a 9.10 install ??
2009-11-01T19:06:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	yes
2009-11-01T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	no way that would work ...
2009-11-25T19:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	maybe it uses broadcom b43xx chip. you have to « sudo aptitude install b43-fwcutter » while conected to internet thrugh the ethernet
2009-11-25T19:53:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	how do I find out if thats the right one?
2009-11-25T19:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	lspci | grep -i net
2009-11-25T19:55:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	if dell is using another wifi, will this still work?
2009-11-25T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	no; if it uses other chip tere are other procedures.
2009-11-25T19:56:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	thanks, I will try it when I see her later
2010-01-21T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	MrNaz not true. there is no isuue. amd64 is compatible with both amd64 and the intel implementation
2010-02-08T21:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	you should try to boot with splash and quiet removed frm the kernel options so you can see what is going on
2010-02-12T16:08:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	you can add a package called remote desktop server
2010-02-12T16:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	talk to luckymurali
2010-02-12T16:09:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	about?
2010-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	about the remote desktop server. he/she is the one with the problem
2010-02-12T16:11:00.000Z	jiohdi	erUSUL	sorry, saw your question
2010-03-07T19:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	it depends on what key you press "k" kills all userspace programs
2010-03-07T19:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	jiohdi	no
