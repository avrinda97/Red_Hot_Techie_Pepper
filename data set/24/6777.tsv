2005-12-23T15:28:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	you can reinstall the same way you installed, but it really ought not to be necessary
2005-12-23T15:29:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	I installed with apt-get is there a reinstall command?
2005-12-23T15:30:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	you upgraded from hoary?
2005-12-23T15:30:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	yes
2005-12-23T15:30:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	what isn't working?
2005-12-23T15:31:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	specifics..."I do X, Y should happen, instead Z happens"
2005-12-23T15:31:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	I turn on my ubuntu box, I should boot into X, I don't
2005-12-23T15:32:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	do you get anything on the screen at all? can you log into a console?
2005-12-23T15:32:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	lt boots to a shell prompt
2005-12-23T15:32:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-12-23T15:35:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	/etc/init.d/gdm start
2005-12-23T15:35:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2005-12-23T15:36:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	that returns me to a shell prompt
2005-12-23T15:41:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	did you do apt-get dist-upgrade?
2005-12-23T15:41:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	yes
2005-12-23T15:48:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	yes you did
2005-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	can you put your sources.list on a pastebin somewhere?
2005-12-23T16:42:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	if you have net access on it, and you've fixed the sources.list file now
2005-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	you might want to apt-get remove the X stuff, then reinstall it
2005-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	rather than reinstalling the whole lot
2005-12-23T16:43:00.000Z	Kris	djm62	how do I remove the X stuff, I mean how do I know which ones are X related?
2005-12-23T16:44:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	apt-get remove xserver-xorg and similar stuff
2005-12-23T16:45:00.000Z	djm62	Kris	you still have no X?
