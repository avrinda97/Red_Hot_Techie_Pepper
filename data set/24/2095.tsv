2009-06-02T07:32:00.000Z	whitt		I know that the ATI drivers are not the best in linux, but whenever I enable the proprietary drivers it works great, until I switch users, then it goes black
2009-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	whitt		i have to power off the machine, it happens everytime i click switch user
2009-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	whitt		I have a Radeon HD 3600, btw
2009-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	I think I had the same problem. Did you ever manually configure your xorg.conf file?
2009-06-02T07:35:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	nope, that scares the crap outta me. lol
2009-06-02T07:37:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	:D. Well that very well could be your issue. Perhaps you could pastebin your xorg.conf file for me to look at? It's located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	http://pastebin.com/m564e6b67
2009-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	Wow, that is a very consice little file!
2009-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	i did just enable the proprietary driver, should I reboot then paste again?
2009-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	i had it enabled, then disabled it earlier
2009-06-02T07:46:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	Try it out now, inserting the resolution where it says: http://pastebin.com/m2e6ccb9f
2009-06-02T07:47:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	BE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR XORG.CONF
2009-06-02T07:49:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	would I put it like this:   "1920x1080"
2009-06-02T07:50:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	Precisely
2009-06-02T07:50:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	with quotes too, or delete those?
2009-06-02T07:50:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	No, keep quotes.
2009-06-02T07:51:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	ok, done, so reboot and keep fingers crossed?
2009-06-02T07:51:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	Seems like the best option. If that doesn't work for whatever reason, I will be stumped. Not that it takes much to stump me :D.
2009-06-02T07:52:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	i will give it a shot, and hopefully let you know, Thanks!
2009-06-02T08:20:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	it did not work
2009-06-02T08:23:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	It's not a monitor issue then if you still had boot. Sorry I couldn't help!
2009-06-02T08:24:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	it never let me get to the log in screen.  it went through the little ubuntu screen and before the gdm manager showed it went all ugly
2009-06-02T08:24:00.000Z	whitt	Fohn	would installing the ATI drivers from their website be any different?
2009-06-02T08:25:00.000Z	Fohn	whitt	That is rather odd, but still similar to my problem. Regarding the drivers, I think not.
