2005-06-19T14:55:00.000Z	Tuxicity		I'm doomed if I cant even load google... :-\
2005-06-19T14:56:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 Perhaps your DHCP server is having issues, have you checked to see if you have an IP?
2005-06-19T14:57:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	I have a WAN IP, yes.
2005-06-19T14:57:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 okay hold on just one second, I'm going to give you an IP to ping
2005-06-19T14:58:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 Load up a command line and type ping 216.239.37.99
2005-06-19T14:59:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	tell me if you get a reply...
2005-06-19T14:59:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	0% packet loss, I get lots of replies
2005-06-19T15:00:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 That means that your DNS server is having troubles.  Because you were pinging google.com's IP address just then ;)
2005-06-19T15:00:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	:o :D lol
2005-06-19T15:01:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 If your other machines are not having this trouble, check to see if you're using the same DNS
2005-06-19T15:03:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	hmm it appears the other PC has different DNS entries...
2005-06-19T15:04:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 Well you can probably get the right ones by reconnecting to the DHCP server...
2005-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	how?
2005-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	oh oh I see
2005-06-19T15:06:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 On your ubuntu box that's having the trouble, you can go into system -> administration -> networking and deactivate / activate it
2005-06-19T15:11:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	trouble is my LAN uses static IPs :-o
2005-06-19T15:12:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 You can do that with a DHCP server.  I take it you don't have one, though?
2005-06-19T15:12:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 I believe you can modify /etc/resolv.conf or use the networking admin tool to change your DNS servers
2005-06-19T15:13:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	my router can act as a DHCP server, but since I want static IPs, I disable dit
2005-06-19T15:14:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 Alright, you'll need to add the DNS servers from the computers that are working properly...
2005-06-19T15:16:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 An ideal way to do static IP addresses is to use reserved addresses on a DHCP server...
2005-06-19T15:19:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	you think my router can do that??
2005-06-19T15:20:00.000Z	SeamusLP	Tuxicity	 No clue, I use a headless linux box as a router ;)  do it how you want, but in your current setup you need to add DNS servers manually.
2005-06-19T15:31:00.000Z	Tuxicity	SeamusLP	hey, what's a "Search Domain" in Network Settings?
