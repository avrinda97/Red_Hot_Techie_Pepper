2009-01-29T06:02:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	to copy in the terminal you need shift+ctrl+c
2009-01-29T06:04:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	no dice... just see's it as a ctrl+c
2009-01-29T06:06:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	I dont know shift+ctrl+c always works for me
2009-07-03T22:15:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	I have ubuntu 9.04 64bit edition, java works for me. I can take a look at my ff profile and see what it using if you wish
2009-07-03T22:16:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	can you go here and tell me if it asks you to install a plugin?  http://www.javatester.org/version.html
2009-07-03T22:17:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	yes, it works for me --> Java Version 1.6.0_13 from Sun Microsystems Inc.
2009-07-03T22:19:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	thank you.  Did you have to do anything special to get java working?  I remember when first getting java 64 bit to work under 8.10 I had to follow this:  [edit: ff just froze... will post link when resolved]
2009-07-03T22:20:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	no, but I'm using a laptop I purchased from System76 with ubuntu 9.04 64bit already installed
2009-07-03T22:20:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	ah, so it came pre-installed.  ok, thanks for the help :)... i'll figure this out :)

2009-07-03T22:23:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	that might be my problem... I have a link called javaws... but no jvm directory
2009-07-03T22:25:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	I have to ask, have you tried going to a flash site and downloading it from there when prompted?
2009-07-03T22:26:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	just downloaded the sun(tm) java plugin for ff off the java taster pae
2009-07-03T22:27:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	at the command line what does   java -version   give you?
2009-07-03T22:28:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	not sure if this will help but this is what I have -->   java version "1.6.0_13"   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_13-b03)   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.3-b02, mixed mode)
2009-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	looks like we have the same thing now
2009-07-03T22:29:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	so it works for you now?
2009-07-03T22:30:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	getting closer :)... for some reason still says browser has java disabled
2009-07-03T22:31:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	yeah, restart ff and see if that helps
2009-07-03T22:32:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	do you have   /opt/java/64/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so
2009-07-03T22:34:00.000Z	gbear14275	exodus_ms	you rock!... I had that plugin but it was disabled... I didn't recognize it at all so didn't enable it.  Didn't realize it was java.  I turned it on and now have a little dancing javaman on the http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml site.  THANKS!
2009-07-03T22:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gbear14275	cool, no problem, glad its working
