2007-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	acke	wols	yeah it is
2007-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	wols	acke	and what happens if you do /etc/init.d/gdm start?
2007-06-19T13:24:00.000Z	acke	wols	it says its not the default manager
2007-06-19T13:25:00.000Z	wols	acke	have you anotehr DM loaded/installed? ls -al /etc/rc2.d/S99*
2007-06-19T13:26:00.000Z	acke	wols	there are things listed when i do taht,, ' ./init.d/rmnologin '
2007-06-19T13:28:00.000Z	wols	acke	that rmnologin is ok. but there should be a S99gdm. if there isn't that's your problem. S99gdm should link back to /etc/init.d/gdm
2007-06-19T13:29:00.000Z	acke	wols	didnt have any ending with gdm
2007-06-19T13:29:00.000Z	acke	wols	what should i do?
2007-06-19T13:29:00.000Z	wols	acke	no gdm in /etc/init.d/?
2007-06-19T13:30:00.000Z	acke	wols	yeah i have gdm there
2007-06-19T13:31:00.000Z	wols	acke	then link it to /etc/rc2/S99gdm. maybe use rcconf or such
2007-06-19T13:33:00.000Z	acke	wols	are you telling me to do a ln -s /etc/init.d/gdm /etc/rc2/S99gdm
2007-06-19T13:33:00.000Z	wols	acke	basically yes
2007-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	acke	wols	im kindof newbie, so what do you mean wiht basically
2007-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	wols	acke	use rcconf
2007-06-19T13:34:00.000Z	wols	acke	and knowing how to use ln -s makes your more knowledgeable about linux than about 90% of the people in here
2007-06-19T13:42:00.000Z	acke	wols	i found this  S13gdm -> ../init.d/gdm
2007-06-19T13:42:00.000Z	acke	wols	isnt that what i was searching for before
2007-06-19T13:42:00.000Z	wols	acke	acke sorta. but way too early imho
2007-06-19T13:42:00.000Z	acke	wols	i dont get it
2007-06-19T13:43:00.000Z	wols	acke	what is the error when you have all X closed and run /etc/init.d/gdm start ? check dmesg and syslog
2007-06-19T13:43:00.000Z	acke	wols	okay i will look at that.
