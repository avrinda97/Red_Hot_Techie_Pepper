2006-10-20T11:47:00.000Z	crimsun	dcordes	then it's not an alsa issue but a hotkey-setup one.
2006-10-20T11:47:00.000Z	dcordes	crimsun	ok where do i set like pcm is my standart volume which is controlled by hotkeys?
2006-10-20T11:52:00.000Z	crimsun	dcordes	'Master' is controlled by default
2006-10-20T11:52:00.000Z	dcordes	crimsun	that's the problem about which i came here --i have no master :-D
2006-10-20T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	dcordes	yes you do.
2006-10-20T11:54:00.000Z	crimsun	dcordes	then you need to bind the hotkey manually. See hotkey-setup.
