2006-11-01T09:32:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	yes
2006-11-01T09:30:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	are you wireless?
2006-11-01T09:30:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	no, wired lan.  worked fine in 6.06 and in a dualboot on another os, so its not the network itself.
2006-11-01T09:31:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	Are you pinging domains or your router?
2006-11-01T09:31:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	i checked the router and other machines on the local netork, and machines on the internet itself
2006-11-01T09:32:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	are your domains resolving to an IP address when you ping?
2006-11-01T09:33:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	so your other apps don't have internet access then, right? nothing else?
2006-11-01T09:33:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	as far as I can tell, nothing network related past pings works.  i can't connect to anything besides pings.  but it gets better.
2006-11-01T09:34:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	i upgraded earlier today, and things were working fine.  i was doing some tasks, and great.  then this problem struck.  but i had just done a clean install, so i figured i must hve messed something up, so ill save time and just reinstall pure.
2006-11-01T09:34:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	but ive had the same problem on 3 vanilla installs since.
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	I had a similar problem with my ethernet when I installed dapper, let alone edgy. my router appeared to be fine just like you
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	did you happen to have your ethernet unplugged when you installed?
2006-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	no, plugged in
2006-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	under System > Admin. > Networking , what are your DNS servers?
2006-11-01T09:38:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	Right well your DNS should be. One sec before you reboot
2006-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	check to see if you have servers in that DNS tab I just mentioned and try again your internet apps
2006-11-01T09:39:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	ok, bb in roughly 5 or so
2006-11-01T09:43:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	dns was the local ip address of my router, which compred to another machine on the network, is set as appropo
2006-11-01T09:44:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	but now, i'm back in edgy and things seem to be working.  FM
2006-11-01T09:44:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	oh so you're working all right in edgy then?
2006-11-01T09:44:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	yeah, but its fkn magic.  i dont understand why it wasnt working before, but magically is now, after 3 reinstalls and a dozen or so reboots.
2006-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	I had the same deal, couldn't pin it down
2006-11-01T09:45:00.000Z	neonempyr	swiz	was hoping we could figure something out; I'm sure it's something simple but deceptively...deceptive. glad it's working
2006-11-01T09:46:00.000Z	swiz	neonempyr	exactly.  and its not even something that you can easily google or look for.  i only found one pertinent response, and it was an unanswered forum thread regarding a similar issue.
