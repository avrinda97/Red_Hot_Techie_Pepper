2010-02-14T12:27:00.000Z	AbizzalsX		grub doesn't display an entry that's in boot.cfg but does display all other boot.cfg entries correctly
2010-02-14T12:28:00.000Z	AbizzalsX		Any thoughts anyone?
2010-02-14T12:28:00.000Z	AbizzalsX		Been battling this for a couple of hours now
2010-02-14T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 boot.cfg? You mean grub.cfg?
2010-02-14T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 i noticed a similer thing with some iso files i was trying to boot.. but havent looked into it lately
2010-02-14T12:29:00.000Z	AbizzalsX	Dr_Willis	Ah - I figure I have some parameter wrong...But without error messages or logging it's difficult to sort out
2010-02-14T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 not sure what to check really.
2010-02-14T12:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	  i wonder if grub is seeing some mistake and thus ignoring the entry
2010-02-14T12:31:00.000Z	AbizzalsX	Dr_Willis	Yeah - Question is what's the mistake?

2010-02-14T12:58:00.000Z	AbizzalsX	Dr_Willis	The "Windows 7" entry doesn't show up at boot time
2010-02-14T12:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 ive heard of others with that issue..   but never seen a fix.  Perhaps the forum may have an suggestion
2010-02-14T12:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 so its shown in grub.cfg but not in the actual grub menu?
2010-02-14T12:59:00.000Z	AbizzalsX	Dr_Willis	Yes
2010-02-14T12:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 ive never had the issue so never looked into it. I think others have had the issue in her befor. but ive never seen a fix.
2010-02-14T13:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AbizzalsX	 i keep my windows and linux on their own hd's so iu can always set the bios to boot the windows drive directly
