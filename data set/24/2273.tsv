2010-02-19T14:32:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	This is your crontab, yeah? Not one in /etc/cron.d/ or something?
2010-02-19T14:33:00.000Z	titan_ark	EvilDennisR	nope, i added this after doing a crontab -e
2010-02-19T14:35:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	\n is obviously a new line in your crontab: SHELL=/bin/sh\n DISPLAY=":0.0"\n 33 01 * * * gnome-calculator

2010-02-19T14:40:00.000Z	titan_ark	EvilDennisR	sorry, but i am new to this, what exactly does the SHELL = ... do? i dint understand the meaning of what you posted?
2010-02-19T14:41:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	SHELL= just specifies what shell is used
2010-02-19T14:41:00.000Z	titan_ark	EvilDennisR	ah okay
2010-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	how is that crontab not working? You know that cron gets run every minute, and if you've specified the minute that you're in, it won't run -- yeah?
2010-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	and you have to exit the editor you're in so crontab can check in your crontab -- yeah?
2010-02-19T14:48:00.000Z	titan_ark	EvilDennisR	I am always trying to run something after a 2 minute wait and i close the editor after making the edit
2010-02-19T14:49:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	titan_ark	you know its  m h  dom mon dow for the crontab, yeah ?
