2011-02-14T08:29:00.000Z	Bendyr		Hey guys- I have a question about creating a bootable USB flash drive with the ubuntu 10.04 image from my mac.  I want to create the image on my mac, but boot my dell mini 9 with that usb drive.  I've tried following the directions on the ubuntu site at: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/netbook/get-ubuntu/download, but no matter what, it doesn't seem to be able to boot off the usb drive
2011-02-14T08:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	Those directions make a USB drive which is only bootable on macs.
2011-02-14T08:30:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	I suspected that might be the case... do you have any idea how to modify those instructions to create one that is bootable on a dell mini 9?
2011-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	Are you set on Ubuntu 10.04? Because I already have an image which will work this way created for 64 bit Ubuntu 10.10.
2011-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	I had read mixed reviews of Unity
2011-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	but I haven't used either
2011-02-14T08:32:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	and my machine is 32-bit
2011-02-14T08:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	OK, I can create a minimal install iso for you that you can dd to a USB drive and boot from a BIOS based machine. What version of Ubuntu would you like?
2011-02-14T08:33:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	and wouldn't I still have the problem getting the image onto a usb stick?
2011-02-14T08:36:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	I was looking for the ubuntu netbook edition actually, is that very different from the standard?
2011-02-14T08:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	The UI is signifigantly different, yes. The minimal installer can install any flavor of Ubuntu depending on what options you choose.
2011-02-14T08:37:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	thank you
2011-02-14T08:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	You're welcome.
2011-02-14T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	http://216.57.70.194/ubuntu_minimal_lucid_i386_ddable.iso
2011-02-14T08:42:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	getting a persmission error
2011-02-14T08:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	Should be fixed now.
2011-02-14T08:44:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	thanks! i'll give this a shot- so once it's downloaded I just need to do "sudo dd if=ubuntu_minimal_lucid_i386_ddable.iso of=/dev/rdisk4" ?
2011-02-14T08:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	Yes.
2011-02-14T08:45:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	sweet thanks a ton, i'll give that a shot
2011-02-14T08:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	You're welcome.
2011-02-14T09:21:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	downloaded!  before I dd it, do I need to format the drive with anything special?
2011-02-14T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	No.
2011-02-14T09:25:00.000Z	Bendyr	Jordan_U	It's working! Thanks, I was going nuts. Ok I gotta log out of this machine cause I need the ethernet drop.  I'm gonna give this a shot.  Thanks a ton for all your help!
2011-02-14T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bendyr	You're welcome :)
