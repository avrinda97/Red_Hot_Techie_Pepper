2007-01-31T17:33:00.000Z	wolferine		anyone familiar with setting up a boot sequence in win, to allow XP, Vista and linux run?
2007-01-31T17:34:00.000Z	wolferine		well, i used install.exe last night
2007-01-31T17:34:00.000Z	wolferine		but I added a new HD into my system, occupying C:
2007-01-31T17:35:00.000Z	wolferine		and the boot record was stored on another partition/drive
2007-01-31T17:35:00.000Z	xdude	wolferine	- I prefer the use of grub....    Ubuntu will find the windows stuff when using grub-install (correct me anyone)
2007-01-31T17:35:00.000Z	wolferine		im sure offerring suggests is a room "good quality", but I am looking to repair something specific
2007-01-31T17:36:00.000Z	wolferine		so if you are unsure, please hold your suggestions, thanks
2007-01-31T17:36:00.000Z	xdude	wolferine	repair?
2007-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	wolferine		maybe my terminology is incorrect
2007-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	xdude		oh windows
2007-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	wolferine		allow me a minute to explain pls
2007-01-31T17:37:00.000Z	xdude		|)
2007-01-31T17:38:00.000Z	wolferine		i have a few HDs in my system, and recently I added one, which occupies c:, and the install.exe(ubuntu) was run last night, and I found this ir in my boot.ini, on my c:
2007-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	wolferine		this is the third OS i am adding, so the default menu was created when I installed Vista
2007-01-31T17:39:00.000Z	wolferine		which currently only has two OSes
2007-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	wolferine		so I was wondering if anyone knows how to edit using bcdedit.exe in Vista to add my ubuntu to my list of boot preferences?
2007-01-31T17:40:00.000Z	xdude	wolferine	- I run Grub with windows XP pro - Suse 10.2 and ubuntu 6.10 options.   I usually set the linux as the primary master.
2007-01-31T17:41:00.000Z	wolferine	xdude	-- good to know, thanks
2007-01-31T17:41:00.000Z	wolferine		ok thanks frogzoo
2007-01-31T17:41:00.000Z	wolferine		later
2007-01-31T17:41:00.000Z	xdude		This way when the Grub is written to the MBR, it only effect the primary master
2007-01-31T17:42:00.000Z	xdude		and all other drives can be reset to master if all else fails
2007-01-31T17:43:00.000Z	xdude		We set up a city community senior center up this way on all the computers.   Now we be teaching seniors Linux
2007-01-31T17:45:00.000Z	xdude	wolferine	 does that make any sense?
