2012-03-31T08:28:00.000Z	AcidRain		i have a question about using software that creates an image of your current harddisk. does that image have to be restored on that same computer. incase if your mobo goes out... will the harddisk still function properly
2012-03-31T08:28:00.000Z	AcidRain		assuming you get a new mobo of course
2012-03-31T08:29:00.000Z	AcidRain		any type of cloning software. does it have to be reinstalled on the same disk, using the same computer with the hardware that it was setup to run with?
2012-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	AcidRain		like a realtek driver, when perhaps another lan card would use a different chipset
2012-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	AcidRain		out
2012-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	AcidRain		ouch*
2012-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	AcidRain		that would be alot of modifications
2012-03-31T08:31:00.000Z	AcidRain		i have an onboard realtek chipset. so... perhaps the next 1 is onboard. then what?
2012-03-31T08:31:00.000Z	AcidRain		well this is about backing up my ubuntu system :)
2012-03-31T08:32:00.000Z	AcidRain		hmmm. ok thx for the help though
2012-03-31T08:32:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	AcidRain	If you make major changees in your motherboard, ofcourse the new restored operating system will not be compatible
2012-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	AcidRain	sddhrthrt	ok. well what about this...... errr....
2012-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	AcidRain		there is just no way to insure that my epic work on this hdd will be safe from destruction.
2012-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	AcidRain		because of so much configuration
2012-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	AcidRain		i mean dont get me wrong. i could do it. but... things in ubuntu that i have configured take time
2012-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	AcidRain		alot of time
2012-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	AcidRain	tell me about it! i backed up my ubuntu 10.04 before trynig to upgrade to ubuntu 12.04, things got messy there, came back, found the backup simply wouldn't work.
2012-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	AcidRain		i wrote a little bash script to backup my important files every morning at 3. but idk if that would be just as good as using something better?
2012-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		Took all the pain to reconfigure.
2012-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		backing up: sid-rt.blogspot.com
2012-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		:D
2012-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	AcidRain	sddhrthrt	yeah thats what im scared of
2012-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		But trustt me AcidRain, It just gets better when you reconfigure it!
2012-03-31T08:36:00.000Z	AcidRain	sddhrthrt	lol. this is the better version right here. i just recently lost all my files. this is why im so concerned in a reliable way to get this done
