2006-05-24T07:01:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	add the command to enable your swap file into /etc/init/bootmics.sh
2006-05-24T07:02:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	 in /etc/init/bootmics.sh
2006-05-24T07:04:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	also of note.  sudo is not needed in the init scripts.
2006-05-24T07:05:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	do this   sudo gedit /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2006-05-24T07:09:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	^
2006-05-24T07:10:00.000Z	shriphani	intelikey	i asked something can you please reply ?
2006-05-24T07:10:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	yes.  less any sudo      init scripts are ran as root, so sudo is not needed
2006-05-24T07:10:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	that impatients of yours is not the way to get help.
2006-05-24T07:15:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	any other questions you have.  just ask someone else.
2006-05-29T08:38:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	!b-e
2006-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	shriphani	intelikey	how do i create a mount point for my external floppy ?
2006-05-29T09:35:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	mkdir.
2006-05-29T09:36:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	a dir is a mount point
2006-05-29T09:37:00.000Z	intelikey	shriphani	you can't mkdir in depth without switches.  it would be     sudo mkdir /mount && sudo mkdir /mount/floppy
2006-05-29T12:03:00.000Z	shriphani	intelikey	tell me why xemacs ./config doesnt create a f00ken makefile
