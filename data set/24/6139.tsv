2006-02-18T16:59:00.000Z	IdleOne		ok jenda
2006-02-18T16:59:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	if the iso is bootable, just do cdrecord -v foo.iso (assuming cdrecord is set up)
2006-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	openbox is good
2006-02-20T07:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	 i have a p2 233mhz
2006-02-20T07:54:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	openbox should run fine on that - it's a better remimplementation of blackbox
2006-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	 im checking it out thanks :)
2006-02-20T07:55:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	200KB binary
2006-02-20T08:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	 openbox runs smooth. thanks! :)

2006-02-28T07:15:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	what would a GUI ssh client do for you?
2006-02-28T07:17:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	what could it do? it doesn't get much simpler than ssh user@host
2006-02-28T07:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	 I saw that
2006-03-30T06:47:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	run xinit on the local machine, ssh -X remote_box, and run whatever command you use to start your wm
2006-03-30T06:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	Ill give that a try :)
2006-03-30T06:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	you mean run xset if not using gdm
2006-03-30T06:50:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	what does gdm have to do with xset? (I don't use gdm)
2006-03-30T06:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	I dont you said it lol
2006-03-30T06:51:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	no, I meant some gnome monitor pm thing that might ignore/override what you did with xset
2006-04-06T08:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	amphi	you mentioned whowatch is that a package?
2006-04-06T08:22:00.000Z	amphi	IdleOne	it is on debian...
