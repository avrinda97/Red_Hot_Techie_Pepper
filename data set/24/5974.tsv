2009-02-06T22:11:00.000Z	jero		ok my swap partition works if that cat /proc/swaps is accurate
2009-02-06T22:12:00.000Z	jero		then i have no clue why i cannot wake up from suspend
2009-02-06T22:12:00.000Z	jero		yep
2009-02-06T22:13:00.000Z	jero		/dev/sda6 listed being 1024mb
2009-02-06T22:14:00.000Z	jero		Any hints how i can track the problem down of suspend not working properly?
2009-02-06T22:15:00.000Z	jero		ramirand - 512mb ram and 1GB for the swap
2009-02-06T22:15:00.000Z	jero		it is an old laptop... but ubuntu makes it fly still compared to winxp
2009-02-06T22:16:00.000Z	jero		actually i tried only suspend, trying hibernation now
2009-02-06T22:16:00.000Z	jero		suspend it would go to sleep mode, but waking up fails
2009-02-06T22:18:00.000Z	jero		on a notebook suspend is quite essential
2009-02-06T22:19:00.000Z	ploom	jero	old laptop might not have acpi, but apm or something instead
2009-02-06T22:19:00.000Z	ploom	jero	never tried it myself tough
2009-02-06T22:19:00.000Z	jero	ploom	- its not that old :D appart it works perfectly fine in windowsXP
2009-02-06T22:19:00.000Z	ploom		I can hibernate even my p4 desktop
2009-02-06T22:20:00.000Z	ploom	jero	first you should try without fancy graphics drivers I guess
2009-02-06T22:20:00.000Z	jero	ploom	- it is still a nc8000 hp with a pentium m 1.6ghz and a ati 9600 radeon. Its quite fast if the ram is not filled
2009-02-06T22:21:00.000Z	jero	ploom	i tried on a fresh install without any drivers. the original drivers make it fail completely
2009-02-06T22:21:00.000Z	jero		nice, i think i need a reinstall after this hibernation attempt
2009-02-06T22:22:00.000Z	ploom	jero	have you tried acpi=off or something similar too?
2009-02-06T22:22:00.000Z	jero		not only suspend does not work, but hibernation got the system stuck at "starting up...." without any disk activity at all
2009-02-06T22:23:00.000Z	jero	ploom	acpi off is quite anti suspend i would think
2009-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	ploom	jero	anyways suspending and hibernating do work for my desk since ibex
2009-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	ploom	jero	for ex they did not work every time before. For ex. I had no sound after resuming
2009-02-06T22:25:00.000Z	jero	ploom	on my notebook it couldnt be worse. i would never have thought a failed hibernation attempt could mark my system unbootable
