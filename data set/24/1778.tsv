2009-08-29T06:33:00.000Z	mmorrow		this worries me very very much (this is regarding the ToshibaNB205, i have a Gateway blahblah with the same wireless card) "Wi-Fi must be enabled in Windows XP before installing UNR or else it is impossible to enable it."
2009-08-29T06:33:00.000Z	mmorrow		so windows was wiped immediately. am i screwed? how can this even be possible?
2009-08-29T06:34:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Did you reinstall Windows?
2009-08-29T06:34:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	i can't, since it didn't come with any sort of restore anything, nor does the laptop have a cd-drive (nor do i have a windows cd)
2009-08-29T06:35:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Does it have a USB port and can it boot from USB?
2009-08-29T06:35:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	yes and yes
2009-08-29T06:36:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	May I interest you in a Linux Live install?
2009-08-29T06:36:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	i've got fedora on it now, but can't seem to get the wireless card to work. so i'm now trying to install ubuntu since i've read that there's a prepackaged working solution in linux-backports-modules-jaunty
2009-08-29T06:37:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Hmm...What wi-fi card is it?
2009-08-29T06:37:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	atheros AR9285
2009-08-29T06:38:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Would you benefit from a Linksys Wireless USB Dongle?  I hear Ubuntu has better compatibility with those
2009-08-29T06:38:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	right, i just tried the ubuntu live usb netbook image, and that dies with "can't find module/something"
2009-08-29T06:38:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	If you can get the exact error message, we may be able to help you with that
2009-08-29T06:40:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	retrying boot now (i build the current snapshot of the drivers from linuxwireless.org, and still no dice. i think this is a hardware-being-disabled-somehow thing)
2009-08-29T06:40:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	as in, somehow it needs to be enabled from windows (which strikes me as a huge wtf)
2009-08-29T06:41:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	do you know how to configure the BIOS?
2009-08-29T06:42:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	yes, there doesn't seem to be any options in the bios setup related to the wireless card
2009-08-29T06:43:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	the reason i think it's hardware or something is that i just read "Wi-Fi must be enabled in Windows XP before installing UNR or else it is impossible to enable it. "   here    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks/ToshibaNB205
2009-08-29T06:44:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Can you try the Ubuntu Desktop version and see if that works?
2009-08-29T06:45:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	hmm, is there any way to transfer that .iso to a usb key for boot?
2009-08-29T06:46:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	I cannot help you there...Someone else in here may be able to tell you how to do that
2009-08-29T06:55:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	Have you tried the Ubuntu Desktop image?
2009-08-29T06:57:00.000Z	mmorrow	mnaines	not yet, downloading the desktop version
2009-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	mnaines	mmorrow	It probably will not give you the results you want, however
