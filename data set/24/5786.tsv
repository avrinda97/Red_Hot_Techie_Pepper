2006-05-05T05:12:00.000Z	Ali		anyone willing to help me reducing my /var/log size ?
2006-05-05T05:14:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	edit /etc/logrotate.conf
2006-05-05T05:14:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	and ?
2006-05-05T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	...use your head.
2006-05-05T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	sorry, that was rude
2006-05-05T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	but you have to decide for yourself what the best balance is between having a log history and disk usage.
2006-05-05T05:16:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	i'd go for a 1 day log file
2006-05-05T05:17:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	4.2G used for log on a 8.7 disk is not fun at all
2006-05-05T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	oh, you've got a problem. Something is logging excessive errors.
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	i know
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	do a 'ls -srS /var/log | tail -n 1' to see what the biggest file is.
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	it's the kernel logging about my cdrom
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	why don't you solve that then?
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	cannot, it's a false error
2006-05-05T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	what does it say/
2006-05-05T05:19:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	drive hdc ... appears confused
2006-05-05T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	have you stfw for that error?
2006-05-05T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	"searched the fine web"
2006-05-05T05:20:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	i always had it with that drive
2006-05-05T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	well, I suggest you solve this problem instead of messing with your log settings.
2006-05-05T05:25:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	it's related to irq, i have a very old mother board with weird irqs
2006-05-05T05:27:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	are you on kernel 2.6.12?
2006-05-05T05:31:00.000Z	soundray	Ali	are you on kernel 2.6.12?
2006-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	Ali	soundray	2.6.15
