2008-07-08T23:17:00.000Z	Br|ce		hi
2008-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	Br|ce		I've got a pretty old (as in edgy) ubuntu server that I'd like to update
2008-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	Br|ce		my problem is my apt-get update would'nt work anymore
2008-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	Br|ce		which is quite annoying since I need it to get the update-manager-core package
2008-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	Br|ce		any idea ?
2008-07-08T23:20:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	I would recommend installing latest version from scratch
2008-07-08T23:20:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	that's gonna be hard, only have a network connection to the server
2008-07-08T23:21:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	as you can see on that upgradenotes page, Edgy is Obsolete
2008-07-08T23:22:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	yeah, I know it is ... which is why I'd like to upgrade
2008-07-08T23:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	"End-of-life releases have been supported previously but have reached the end of their support cycle. It would be best for users of these versions to perform a fresh install of the latest Ubuntu release. Links have been removed since the upgrades between these versions are no longer supported." I guess you're out of luck
2008-07-08T23:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	damn me for not following links properly: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FeistyUpgrades
2008-07-08T23:25:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	only problem is it asks me to apt-get update update-manager-core
2008-07-08T23:25:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	and I can't
2008-07-08T23:26:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	update wouldn't work, and instlal network manager core wouldn't find the package
2008-07-08T23:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	to be honest with you, multiple upgrades are a pain that I've only done once and therefore I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't think I have enough info to handle your upgrade setup
2008-07-08T23:28:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	ok, thanks anyway
2008-07-08T23:41:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	turns out it IS possible to find a working mirror
2008-07-08T23:41:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	I'm currently using http://mirror.ne.gov/ubuntu
2008-07-08T23:41:00.000Z	Jowi	Br|ce	great. I hope your upgrade goes smoothly
2008-07-08T23:42:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	was a pain in the a*** but using a search engine with inurl: keywords turned out to be helpful
2008-07-08T23:51:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	do you have an idea on why my hand was shaking when I typed "y" on the do-release-upgrade command ?
2008-07-09T00:01:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	restarting, nuts kicking
2008-07-09T00:40:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	just finished the upgrade to hardy !
2008-07-09T00:40:00.000Z	Br|ce	Jowi	that went smoother than I expected
