2008-03-01T19:40:00.000Z	panfist		in the wikipedia description of AIGLX they say it works like this: "This allows remote X clients to get fully hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol." Does this mean if I have an ubuntu server with no 3d graphics, and a desktop with 3d graphics, I can remote into the server and play 3d games on the server but rendered locally?
2008-03-01T19:40:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	of course
2008-03-01T19:41:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	ok im going to try something crazy. i want to play dungeon keeper 2, which doesnt run very well on XP but my server is ubuntu, and dungeon keeper works fine in wine. i'm going to try to remote into my server to play dungeon keeper over RDMCP/AIGLX/WINE
2008-03-01T19:42:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	good luck
2008-03-01T19:43:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	how do i know i'm using AIGLX?
2008-03-01T19:43:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	your xorg log will tell you. but to be hones I have no clue if xming supports 3D. I doubt it
2008-03-01T19:44:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	ahhh i see
2008-03-01T19:44:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	what about some other method of remote desktop like cygwin
2008-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	that uses xming. I'd try to run virtualbox on windows and linux inside that. it supposedtly has hardware3D now for guests. you could try it
2008-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	from the wiki article: xming now comes with mesa3d support...that's opengl right?
2008-03-01T19:46:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	software3D.... tho for dungeonkeeper it might work if your CPU is good enough
2008-03-01T19:46:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	the CPU of my server or the clien
2008-03-01T19:46:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	X server. that's where it displays. and don't even thing to try under a 100Mbit connection
2008-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	it's gigabit and the xserver is running on a 3.4ghz dualcore penryn
2008-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	chances are good :)
2008-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	i'll give it a shot and let you know if I can get it working soon
2008-03-01T20:05:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	what xserver?
2008-03-01T20:06:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	im sorry that was a bad question...i'll have some stuff to pastebin in a sec
2008-03-01T20:10:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	xming is not ubuntu. we cannot and will not help you. ask elsewhere
2008-03-01T20:10:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	cp <sourcefile>  /usr/local/bin    as root
2008-03-01T20:11:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	well i'm guessing if I can get it to run in ubuntu, when I remote in it will work just like it was running locally
2008-03-01T20:11:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	I doN't care what you guess. xmwing support is OT
2008-03-01T20:12:00.000Z	panfist	wols_	fine forget i even mentioned xming, how do i get aiglx locally and natively
2008-03-01T20:13:00.000Z	wols_	panfist	I cannot forget your trying to circumvent support policies. no go away and don't ask me underhandedly anymore
