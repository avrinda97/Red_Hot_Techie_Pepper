2008-06-01T01:55:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer		(or the network, much less the internet)
2008-06-01T01:55:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	do you see eth1 when you type ifconfig ?
2008-06-01T01:56:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	yes I do see eth1 upon typing ifconfig
2008-06-01T01:56:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	does it have an IP address ?
2008-06-01T01:57:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	an inet address?
2008-06-01T01:58:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	an IP address... when you type ifconfig eth1 do you see an IP address?
2008-06-01T01:59:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	and is eth1 connected to a network with DHCP ?
2008-06-01T02:00:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	It should not be. Only DHCP/roaming mode works though. I set it to static but it won't work for some reason
2008-06-01T02:00:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	I dont get what you are trying to do, what is eth1 connected to and why do you need it?
2008-06-01T02:01:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	I use eth1 as my main port(this pc has 2 gblan ports) since it has better buffering, etc.
2008-06-01T02:01:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	so what is eth1 connected to ?
2008-06-01T02:02:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	I mean eth0
2008-06-01T02:02:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	ok, so you are using eth0 at the moment ?
2008-06-01T02:02:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	usually I don't connect eth0 to anything. I'm using eth0 at the moment though
2008-06-01T02:03:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	ok, so do you have two network cables plugged into the same network at the moment? or do you have to manually switch the cable to test eth1 ?
2008-06-01T02:04:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	I manually switch the cable. I'm supposed to use eth1. I tested eth0, and it works.
2008-06-01T02:04:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	ok, how is eth0 setup? roaming mode?
2008-06-01T02:05:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	also static. Just that static works on eth0, not eth1. Different ips of course.
2008-06-01T02:06:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	give them the same IP address, as they are never plugged in at the same time they can't conflct. Then, switch cables... type sudo ifconfig eth1 down - then sudo ifconfig eth1 up - then try connect; if that fails, try ping an ip address on your network (router for example) and take note of the error message
2008-06-01T02:07:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	leave a 10 second gap between the up/down/ping
2008-06-01T02:14:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	nope, still doesn't work
2008-06-01T02:14:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	error message when you tried to ping ?
2008-06-01T02:15:00.000Z	stu	Swiftfoxer	are you getting a link light? and did you try the same IP address as eth0 ?
2008-06-01T02:15:00.000Z	Swiftfoxer	stu	yes it was the same ip address
