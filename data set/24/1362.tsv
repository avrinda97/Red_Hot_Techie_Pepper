2010-02-18T23:20:00.000Z	Pianoman13		is there an expert in wireless configuration in here today?
2010-02-18T23:21:00.000Z	Pianoman13		i have an hp laptop Compaq 8710p with a Linksys wireless-g wrt54gp2 router that works in vista but not in ubuntu 9.10
2010-02-18T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	the router is moot. Run: sudo lshw -C network
2010-02-18T23:23:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	ok i ran the sudo command
2010-02-18T23:25:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	description: Wireless interface
2010-02-18T23:26:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	sorry, which line and for what purpose?
2010-02-18T23:26:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	it's not working
2010-02-18T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	make sure your system is fully updated too. This may help
2010-02-18T23:28:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	thanks, i tried many guides so far but cannot follow the instructions, maybe when i get older, as i said i am only 3 weeks old on this ubuntu
2010-02-18T23:28:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	yes my system is fully updated
2010-02-18T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	most guides are fairly decent and step by step
2010-02-18T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	if all else fails you can install ndisgtk and use the windows driver which matches your ubuntu arch (32bit/64bit)
2010-02-18T23:29:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	yes but for a new user ther are very difficult to follow and reference are many opf times outdated or not relevant to the software hardare used
2010-02-18T23:30:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	ndisgtk is already installed but i do not know what to do with it!
2010-02-18T23:30:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	i don't even know where it is?
2010-02-18T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	you need the windows driver .inf and .sys
2010-02-18T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	press alt+f2, type: gksudo ndisgtk ,press enter
2010-02-18T23:31:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	YES but where are they if the big question
2010-02-18T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	on the install cd or the manufacturers site
2010-02-18T23:32:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	thanks for your help by the way, do you mean the intel or Linksys manufacturer
2010-02-18T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pianoman13	linksys
2010-02-18T23:33:00.000Z	Pianoman13	ActionParsnip	ok, i will go and check on their web site
