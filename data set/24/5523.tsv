2008-04-27T22:42:00.000Z	eric_		oops sorry
2008-04-27T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	if it is your only / everyday system   ... dual boot it , or make full backup or hold off for a week as support catches up
2008-06-20T02:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	while I dont know the answer. YOu need to tell people how you installed FF3   from our repos or did you download it yourself
2008-06-20T02:07:00.000Z	eric_	Jack_Sparrow	Whos looking?  I just installed the firefox-3.0 package in synaptic..
2008-06-20T02:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	Please move discussions and opinions to offtopic..
2008-07-01T03:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	Were you trying to install a version other than the one available in our repos
2008-07-01T03:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	Did you change any sources before the apt-get
2008-07-01T03:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	doesnt matter...
2008-07-01T03:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-07-01T03:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	looking now
2008-07-01T03:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	mixing gutsy and hardy repos is not a good idea
2008-07-01T03:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	It may nave been what got you...  I have no way of knowing.. I would remove # the gutsy repo  update, upgrade and hope for the best
2008-07-01T03:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	You know a single command in a terminal will backup everything for you..
2008-07-01T03:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	yes
2008-07-01T03:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	If you after you reinstall..  you can doa system backup very easily
2008-07-01T03:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	too late for a backup
2008-07-01T03:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	for the next time
2008-07-01T03:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	the command is fine..  just backup if you end up reinstalling or create a sep /home.. it will save you a lot of frustration
2008-07-01T03:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	tar cvpzf backup.tgz --exclude=/backup.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/dev --exclude=/lost+found  --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media --exclude=/root/.Trash -- /
2008-07-01T03:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	yes everything should be in ~   but double check your bookmarks and save them to your desktop
2008-07-01T03:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eric_	good luck, sorry it wasnt a simpler soultion
