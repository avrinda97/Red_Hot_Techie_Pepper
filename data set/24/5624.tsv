2006-07-08T08:35:00.000Z	Ayabara		Carmen: count to 10
2006-07-08T08:37:00.000Z	Ayabara		I have a 100gb drive on my laptop. the xp partition is 12gb. how much should I use for the partition I will install ubuntu on?
2006-07-08T08:38:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	a standard install will be fine on 4-5 GB.. Conider a separate /home ond maybe /var partition.
2006-07-08T08:39:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	ok. what goes in /var?
2006-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	/var holds logfiles, the apt-cache and in some cases mail... stuff which should only grow to a certain limit
2006-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	tell me how much RAM you have, how much diskspace you have and i could suggest a partition layout
2006-07-08T08:44:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	do you burn DVDs frequently?
2006-07-08T08:45:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	not really. I store stuff I seldom use on a 300GB external, and burn backups of what I can't afford to lose
2006-07-08T08:51:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	and read about tmpfs.. it pays to have the /tmp in virtual memory. Thus there's the use for the large swap
2006-07-08T08:53:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	thanks! now I just gotta think and see if I understood you? I need to read up on the folder structure in Linux...
2006-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	feel free to ask, if you are unsure about smething
2006-07-08T08:57:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	just about to start ;-)
2006-07-08T08:58:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	in any case, i#d recommend not to use the automatic scheme that the installer suggests...
2006-07-08T08:59:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	I think I will use the setup you suggest. thought about giving the xp install a fat32 storage partition but I'm not sure
2006-07-08T08:59:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	Oh yes... you'll need a fat32 for data exchange
2006-07-08T09:00:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	when I start adding applications and stuff, this will be put in my /root partition right?
2006-07-08T09:00:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	could use the external for this
2006-07-08T09:01:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	you could as well use the 'big rest' as fat32... but then cannot use it as /home
2006-07-08T09:02:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	ok. than I will put /home one the root part and symlink to the fat32 like you said?
2006-07-08T09:04:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	won't 5bg for root+home be too little if I start adding a lot of apps?
2006-07-08T09:06:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	the complete install of EVERYHING is about 7GB.. an average system will be 3 GB.. you could rise the space for / to 10GB if you want to build software on it,
2006-07-08T09:07:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	ok. now I have a plan, and 97% of the ubuntu cd is burned :-)
2006-07-08T09:11:00.000Z	Ayabara	stefg	snoops: thanks for helping me out. starting the procedure now :-)
2006-11-14T15:39:00.000Z	stefg	Ayabara	have a look at /etc/modules
