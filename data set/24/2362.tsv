2009-03-25T09:55:00.000Z	afallenhope		hey I recompiled all the alsa drivers and utils and everything so I know it's not an issue with that. I'm simply asking if I'm trying to follow the following tutorial does it matter that I'm on amd64 running 32 bit skype and 64bit jackd? (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=577914)
2009-03-25T09:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	that would probably be best asked on that forum thread
2009-03-25T09:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	did you actually compile alsa drivers from source?
2009-03-25T09:57:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	yeah. I used the script provided at: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6589810
2009-03-25T09:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	wow, thats really not recommended....
2009-03-25T09:59:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	runs better than it used to..
2009-03-25T10:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	well, I would recommend using one of those tutorial threads
2009-03-25T10:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	compiling modules from source is really not the ubuntu way of doing things
2009-03-25T10:01:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	yeah... well ubuntu is slow at releasing UP TO DATE drivers. soooo I do it my own way lol.
2009-03-25T10:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	yes, it is now considered a dead project
2009-03-25T10:03:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	yeah..well.. people like to use the power of ALSA rather than using crappy sound like pulse
2009-03-25T10:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	I don't use ubuntu, I just hang out and help the linux newbs :)
2009-03-25T10:04:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	lol nice
2009-03-25T10:07:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	what distro you running?
2009-03-25T10:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	gentoo
2009-03-25T10:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	a bit of extra work but always up to date
2009-03-25T10:08:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	good man lol. good os.. I WAS running it.. then i decided to try ubuntu... bad choice..
2009-03-25T10:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	yeah, I think of ubuntu as mainly a starter distro
2009-03-25T10:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	the gateway drug into linux :)
2009-03-25T10:10:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	nice!
2009-03-25T10:10:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	I tired fedora.. then I ran away lol tooo many bugs
2009-03-25T10:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	afallenhope	I'm not a big fan of fedora/centos/red hat
2009-03-25T10:11:00.000Z	afallenhope	Titan8990	noice! mind if I pm you a sec?
