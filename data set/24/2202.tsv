2009-09-02T21:41:00.000Z	lenswipe		theres nobody home in #samba
2009-09-02T21:41:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	printers are PITA
2009-09-02T21:41:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	huh?
2009-09-02T21:42:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	what do you mean?
2009-09-02T21:42:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	CUPS is pain in the ass...
2009-09-02T21:43:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	i wasnt gonna use CUPS nyway - i was gonna use the print$ share
2009-09-02T21:44:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	you can't do it without cups. because cups is what does printing )
2009-09-02T21:44:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	im not trying to print from it - just provide a location to download print drivers from - i understand thats what the print$ share is for but i dont know how to get it to work
2009-09-02T21:45:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	ahhh, that... i think, the fastest and easiest way is to create this share on pure windows pc then replicate it.
2009-09-02T21:46:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	not sure what you mean
2009-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	Find a windows PC, install printer drivers (remove excess drivers), share printer. Go to it's print$ and copy all share to your own
2009-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	right what im saying is how?
2009-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	i got printer drivers installed on my laptop
2009-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	now what?
2009-09-02T21:49:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	hmm. i am confused :) i understood that you want just to make a fake printer share to allow someone to install drivers. It's possible.
2009-09-02T21:50:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	yeah thats it, just not sure how...
2009-09-02T21:50:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	how to make a share on samba?
2009-09-02T21:50:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	i got the drivers on my laptop so i got a windows machine (xp pro) which has the drivers and i have a samba server with a config file, now what do i do?
2009-09-02T21:50:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	yeah i know to make a share on samba..
2009-09-02T21:51:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	do you want to be able to install this drivers on other windows pcs or to print from linux using this drivers?
2009-09-02T21:52:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	i want to have a linux machine with the windows drivers and i want the windows machines to be able to pick the drivers up from there - im given to understand that the print$ is designed for this but i could be wrong..
2009-09-02T21:54:00.000Z	guest_007	lenswipe	yes, that's it. they could install drivers from that share. but they won't go further. because there is no actual printer.
2009-09-02T21:54:00.000Z	lenswipe	guest_007	???
