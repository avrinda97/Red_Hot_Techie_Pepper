2007-07-29T16:20:00.000Z	alecwh		I'm looking for an HTML WYSIWYG editor that has support for web standards, does anyone have any suggestions?
2007-07-29T16:20:00.000Z	alecwh		amaya freezes my machine.
2007-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	alecwh		nvu is horrible, I've tried it.
2007-07-29T16:21:00.000Z	alecwh		it's mutilating standards.
2007-07-29T16:22:00.000Z	alecwh		OK.
2007-07-29T16:23:00.000Z	alecwh		ok

2007-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	alecwh		Quanta is for KDE, will it work with GNOME?
2007-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	alecwh		is there a downside?
2007-07-29T16:24:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 I use Quanta with Gnome its fine
2007-07-29T16:25:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 you need to kill the cd line in your sources.list
2007-07-29T16:25:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 its in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-07-29T16:30:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 btw - I havent found a WYSIWYG dev tool yet that is even near compliant tho - mainly because compliancy depends on knowing CSS now and most all of those clients are weak
2007-07-29T16:31:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	I'm an experienced web developer, I just need to construct a tabular table, and it's easier to do it visually than with gEdit.
2007-07-29T16:32:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 if you are doing a tabular table and not using CSS your probably arent that experienced yet :)  But feel free :)  Quanta is probably the best the OSS has to offer I think
2007-07-29T16:34:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	CSS is the language I've been studying for years now. Constructing a table that actually uses tabular data (prices... ect) a WYSIWYG editor is better. In fact, using CSS for it is not a choice option, earlier browsers don't support tables styled with CSS very well.
2007-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 CSS is now mandated tho, so, its up to you how you style your tables.
2007-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	mandated? CSS is a specification... and merely a "suggestion" for web developers.
2007-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 lol.. well ok..hehe
2007-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	and ShackJack: Glad we can agree. But it's important to realize that tables are not bad, and ARE SUGGESTED for tabular data.
2007-07-29T16:37:00.000Z	kkathman	alecwh	 I didnt say that CSS was solely used for tabular data. but if you do look up the standards, you'll find that new standards have deprecated many HTML commands with the end result pointing toward their implementation in CSS
2007-07-29T16:40:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	The elements that are deprecated (<b>,<i>,<strong>,<strike>,<center>...) doesn't mean that they are removed. Browsers WILL continue to implement them for the sole reason of completeness. They aren't recommended. However, there are NO table elements that are deprecated, because there isn't a replacement. You can create a table with CSS, however the methods are not widely supported, and won't be very useful until a more XML based web is
2007-07-29T16:41:00.000Z	alecwh	kkathman	I win. ;)
