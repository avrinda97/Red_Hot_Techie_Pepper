2011-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	lapaga		it does not really matter because both are working fine but any idea why winxp and xubuntu would show different ip's?
2011-06-07T05:53:00.000Z	lapaga		that would be my ip
2011-06-07T05:54:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	I don't understand. Are you running a dual boot?
2011-06-07T05:54:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	 for now am running xubuntu as wubi
2011-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Forgive me, but when you install with wubi, does it install a dual boot or is it virtualization?
2011-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	it is a real install on a virtual disk as far as I know (not positive though)
2011-06-07T05:58:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	I guess without getting too into it, there's a half dozen reasons why the two would have different ips, it's nothing to worry about
2011-06-07T05:59:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	not worried just curious...my ip comes from my cable company and rarely changes in windows just curious as to why it is not the same in xubuntu...like I said it is not important just curious
2011-06-07T06:00:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Are you getting two different external ip addresses or are you behind a router?
2011-06-07T06:01:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	it is an external ip - I have no router...just a nic to a cable modem and then to the cable company
2011-06-07T06:02:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	If the two installs use the same nic, I have no idea why you could get a different dhcp lease.
2011-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Do you have one NIC or multiple?
2011-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	just one
2011-06-07T06:09:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Yeah, it's strange. Either the DHCP server is messing with you, or maybe on your old windows install you manually set an ip address and your ubuntu is on automatic.
2011-06-07T06:10:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Typically, the dhcp server picks up o your hardware and gives you an IP. With cable, this will typically not change, and if it changes, it will be once and it will be permanent (because the company moved ip blocks or restarted their dhcp server or something)
2011-06-07T06:11:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	yes i agree it is strange...only think in windows is ip assigned by dhcp
2011-06-07T06:12:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	as far as I know the cable company assigns ip's by the mac address so that makes it even more strange...like I said was just curious
2011-06-07T06:13:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	Right. Based upon your description, I don't know why it would behave that way.
2011-06-07T06:14:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	if I just use the livecd my ip changes every time I boot so to me at least makes no sense
2011-06-07T06:15:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	How are you viewing your ip address?
2011-06-07T06:16:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	ifconfig
2011-06-07T06:19:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	*shrug* dunno. Dynamic addresses are dynamic.
2011-06-07T06:21:00.000Z	lapaga	FrankDrebin68	well thanks for the time - eventually maybe I can figure out why (not that it matters).
2011-06-07T06:23:00.000Z	FrankDrebin68	lapaga	np
