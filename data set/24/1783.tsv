2009-08-26T01:30:00.000Z	mickster04	digitalbuddy	well if it works then there is something else the problem
2009-08-26T01:36:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	mickster04	there is an option in my router called single port forwarding? there are apps like http ftp telnet pop3 and their in and out ports and their protocols and their ip addresses they are all unchecked are they useful in solving the problem?

2009-08-26T01:40:00.000Z	mickster04	digitalbuddy	torrenting...that uses the same system as skype to connect...
2009-08-26T01:42:00.000Z	digitalbuddy	mickster04	how is that related to skype if then could it solve the problem?
2009-08-26T01:42:00.000Z	mickster04	digitalbuddy	basically they would both break. they both use p2p to conncet to the internet if one works then they should both work.
