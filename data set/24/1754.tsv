2009-09-08T18:26:00.000Z	erika2009		anyone with wireless chipset ath5k?
2009-09-08T18:27:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	yep
2009-09-08T18:27:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	can you walk me through to get it working? im novice
2009-09-08T18:28:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	modprobe ath5k should work.
2009-09-08T18:28:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	if it doesn't it will give an error message or at least it will print something on dmesg
2009-09-08T18:30:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	nothing happend still no wireless networks
2009-09-08T18:30:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	what was the output of the command and what does executing the command dmesg say?
2009-09-08T18:31:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	I think it is quite impossible that modprobe foo && dmesg doesn't show anything when the driver wasn't already loaded.
2009-09-08T18:32:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	Does dmesg | grep ath5k show anything?
2009-09-08T18:33:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	and you must be sure of course that there are wireless networks in the area to begin with.
2009-09-08T18:33:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	it is home wireless network
2009-09-08T18:33:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	I use some Gnome tool called Network manager or something like that. Just put it to adhoc and it should connect.
2009-09-08T18:33:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	I have the same chip.\
2009-09-08T18:34:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	so, you just make sure the driver doesn't display errors in dmesg and try that Gnome application.
2009-09-08T18:34:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	It has been some time for me, but starting synaptic and searching for something called network manager should do it.
2009-09-08T18:35:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	if the driver is loaded, it is enabled.
2009-09-08T18:35:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	forms?
2009-09-08T18:35:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	who/what is forms?
2009-09-08T18:37:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	I am also not sure of the state of Ubuntu wireless in general. I had to install from source to get ath5k working for example.
2009-09-08T18:39:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	can you walk me through it? from source?? I appreciate it if you can help me
2009-09-08T18:40:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	if you have a website thats fine :)
2009-09-08T18:41:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	I don't, but the forums explain it too, I think.
2009-09-08T18:41:00.000Z	pozic	erika2009	and I am not up to date. You should just try for yourself or ask on the forums. If you are novice, searching and asking the forums is the best thing to do. I am quite busy.
2009-09-08T18:42:00.000Z	erika2009	pozic	thanks
