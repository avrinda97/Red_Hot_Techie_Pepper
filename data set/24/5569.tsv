2011-03-31T19:36:00.000Z	Combatjuan		I'd like to set up my own apt-get repository.  It would only have custom builds of a few packages.  My searches have only yielded information on setting up mirrors.  Can someone point me to a guide or am I asking for nonsense?
2011-03-31T19:37:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	you don't want to create a PPA?
2011-03-31T19:38:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	I don't know.  I want it to be private and local.

2011-09-01T19:39:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	install actual vim, you will have alternative automatically...
2011-09-01T19:40:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	Dr_Willis: Real vim is installed, it is not a choice when I do "update-alternative --config editor"
2011-09-01T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	you want to update the vim alternative
2011-09-01T19:41:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	Sorry, I don't know how to do that.  It doesn't seem to be "update-alternative --config vim"
2011-09-01T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	it is
2011-09-01T19:41:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	I mistyped it.  Now I get "There is only one alternative in link group vim: /usr/bin/vim.basic"
2011-09-01T19:41:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	but editor should also list the vim variants.  How did you install real vim?
2011-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	"apt-get install vim" -> "vim is already the newest version"
2011-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	try vim-gtk or vim-gnome
2011-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	This is a headless machine.
2011-09-01T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	vim-nox then
2012-06-20T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	are you using ubuntu?
2012-06-20T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	you enabled the root account yourself?  What further modifications did you make to sshd_config?  To your system?
2012-06-20T19:08:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	I did not enable the root login myself as far as I'm aware.  Actually, let me check, that may have been changed automatically as part of a setup script.
2012-06-20T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	the root account is disabled by default on ubuntu.  How did you install this system?
2012-06-20T19:13:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	It looks like part of the post-install script is to copy an sshd_config over the existing one.  If I diff the current copy to the backup of the original it says the only line changed is UseDNS no .  So I doubt my 'backup' copy is clean.
2012-06-20T19:13:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	that's impossible since root login isn't allowed by default either
2012-06-20T19:14:00.000Z	Combatjuan	jrib	Yes.  That's my point.
2012-06-20T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	can you pastebin the current sshd_config?
2012-06-20T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	Combatjuan	I don't think so
