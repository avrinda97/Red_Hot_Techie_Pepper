2009-03-24T08:02:00.000Z	damnubuntu		anybody try installing backtrack 3 on ubuntu with vm?  I keep getting the normal startup and then it aborts and when i try to start it again it says FATAL no bootable media
2009-03-24T08:04:00.000Z	damnubuntu		frosterr what kind of driver you using?
2009-03-24T08:06:00.000Z	damnubuntu		i have an aspire one and I think the  madwifi drivers are the best
2009-03-24T08:07:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	just dont want the overhead of recompiling often...but...does it work for the -7 kernel?  -11 I dont even get eth0 up
2009-03-24T08:08:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	yep, but I'm only using wep :(
2009-03-24T08:10:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	do you have the restricted driver manager enabled or disabled
2009-03-24T08:12:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	doesnt even see hardware.  in modules nothing listed, in restricted modules common, disabled ath_hal
2009-03-24T08:13:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	Im guessing that network manager isn't showing wireless networks either right?
2009-03-24T08:13:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	NADA!
2009-03-24T08:14:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	i cant get network manager to even know there's a card in the machine
2009-03-24T08:15:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	do you know what modules, restricted modules common files look like on stock install?  Whats blacklisted and not?
2009-03-24T08:16:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	type lspci in a terminal  and see if it recognizes the wifi card
2009-03-24T08:16:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR242x 802.11abg Wireless PCI Express Adapter (rev 01)
2009-03-24T08:23:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	turn off restricted drivers and try sudo aptitude install linux-backports-modules-intrepid in terminal
2009-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	 that's already done - backports via sources manager, just turned off restricted.  Reloaded ath_pci and ath_hal (but thats in my restricted modules common blacklist) so I guess I should kill it
2009-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	robert@AAo:~$ sudo rmmod ath_hal
2009-03-24T08:27:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	blacklist ath_pci and reboot
2009-03-24T08:27:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	where/which file?
2009-03-24T08:28:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	/etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
2009-03-24T08:29:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	be right back.....famous last words!
2009-03-24T08:39:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	no dice. even tried putting back ath_hal is blacklist and madwifi.  nothingworked
2009-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	damnubuntu	frosterrj	Okay man this will make it work out of the box with ath5k add jaunty's repositorys in synapti. then get the 2.6.28.6 kernel
2009-03-24T08:42:00.000Z	frosterrj	damnubuntu	how to do that? check intrepid proposed?
