2007-04-14T08:11:00.000Z	RainCT_2		Hi, how can I share a wvdial connection with another computer with Ubuntu and one with XP?
2007-04-14T08:12:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	the easiest way is to install firestarter. on the first run it will ask you if you want to share the connection
2007-04-14T08:13:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	cool, thanks
2007-04-14T08:13:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	and how can I let Firestarter start automatically when I start the computer?
2007-04-14T08:14:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	it does. you don't have to do anything
2007-04-14T08:16:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	ah, so the icon at the panel isn't required?
2007-04-14T08:16:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	nope
2007-04-14T08:17:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	it is started as a daemon when you boot
2007-04-14T08:18:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	:) and how can I configure the other computers to go throught this one?
2007-04-14T08:18:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	tell them that this computer is your gateway
2007-04-14T08:19:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	yes, but how?
2007-04-14T08:19:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	at proxy configuration (on ubuntu)?
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	you said the other machine is a winbox?
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	there are two, a XP and a Ubuntu Feisty
2007-04-14T08:21:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	look around in the  "network configuration" dialog. there should be a setting for "default gateway"
2007-04-14T08:21:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	don't know exactly how it is named or where to look
2007-04-14T08:26:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	ok, found it. what IP should I write there?
2007-04-14T08:26:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	the ip of the machine which is connected to the net
2007-04-14T08:27:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	to find out it's ip address run "ifconfig" on this machine
2007-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	I configured Feisty's connection with static ip, ip: 10.0.0.3, submask: 255.0.0.0, gateway: 10.0.0.1, and pings to 10.0.0.1 are working (firestarter also says 0.2kb/s incoming on eth1) but I can't ping any site (nor domain nor ip) from outsite
2007-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	is you internet connection up?
2007-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	yes
2007-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	hamlet	RainCT_2	out of ideas. it should work if it's done correctly
2007-04-14T08:45:00.000Z	RainCT_2	hamlet	ok, thank you
