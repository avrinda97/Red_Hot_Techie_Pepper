2009-03-30T02:46:00.000Z	zekAtreides		i installed xubuntu 8.10 on an IBM thinkpad A20m it installed fine and at the login window the mouse cursor moves fluently and for a short time after i log in it moves fluently then it starts lagging really badly, sometimes the cursor disappears and it is impossible to do anything on the system i think it is 128mb or 256(not sure) and ~700mHz, ideas?
2009-03-30T02:48:00.000Z	zekAtreides		are there some boot options to change or something.  or maybe a different windows manager that would take less resources, i dont neet much i am comfortable with a command line
2009-03-30T02:49:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	Xcfe is i guess the lightest
2009-03-30T02:50:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	ideas on removing the lag
2009-03-30T02:51:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	depends upon the lag is your file browser crashing taking to much time... depends
2009-03-30T02:51:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	what about file browser crashing?
2009-03-30T02:52:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	well for starters if you are on gnome you'll find that nautilus crashes a lot while running vids
2009-03-30T02:52:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	that gets solved in KDE using dolphin
2009-03-30T02:53:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	ok but this is just xubuntu and i didnt do anything at startup, i just let it login and my mouse cursor still lags without any action
2009-03-30T02:54:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	well it means that a process is hogging ur memory or something not sure about that....you should try gnome or KDE if you havnen't done so yeet
2009-03-30T02:55:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	do you mean at the sessions during login try the failsafe gnome?
2009-03-30T02:56:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	ok first of all...what DE have you on ?
2009-03-30T02:56:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	all 3 ?

2009-03-30T02:57:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	ok go to terminal and install gnome
2009-03-30T02:57:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	under the the sessions option on login there is a failsafe gnome
2009-03-30T02:57:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-03-30T02:58:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	yes its like recovery...but you should download the whole thing from the terminal
2009-03-30T02:58:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	ok ill try that
2009-03-30T02:58:00.000Z	zekAtreides	pronoy	should i boot under recovery then use the root terminal?
2009-03-30T03:00:00.000Z	pronoy	zekAtreides	yes its like recovery...but you should download the whole thing from the terminal
