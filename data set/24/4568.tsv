2007-03-12T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 the firefox extensions are easy to find. IF they do what you need. is another question
2007-03-12T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 gnome may have a similer feature.. but it depends on what you are doing i guess
2008-02-19T04:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 what game.. You probely RUN the insaller. not mount it.
2008-02-19T04:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 you mean to say  its an image of a windows game cd?
2008-02-19T04:52:00.000Z	m1r	Dr_willis	yes
2008-05-11T18:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 close all programs accessing the cdrom - or it wont unmount

2008-05-11T18:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 let me guess.. some stupid game with wine?
2008-05-11T18:48:00.000Z	m1r	Dr_willis	correct!:)
2008-05-11T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 for wine/games/multi-cd i tend to copy ALL the files from both cd's (or more) to a single dir, then use wine and start the installer from that directory.
2008-05-11T18:49:00.000Z	m1r	Dr_willis	somehow game dont work if installing from hdd
2008-05-11T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	m1r	 check the wine app database then - they may have a fix.
2008-05-11T18:49:00.000Z	m1r	Dr_willis	it is ok, now, it unmounted after 5 min :)
