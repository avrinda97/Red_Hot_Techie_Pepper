2009-04-17T01:59:00.000Z	Waldir		hey guys... I think I have a serious problem... the sound volume all of a sudden became very low and this is happening both in windows and ubuntu! what could be my problem?
2009-04-17T02:00:00.000Z	Waldir		what could have caused it?
2009-04-17T02:01:00.000Z	juaco	Waldir	maybe accidentally swapped line-out, spk-out ports?
2009-04-17T02:01:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	how?
2009-04-17T02:02:00.000Z	juaco		some cards come with amplified/non amplified jacks
2009-04-17T02:03:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	I only have jacks for mic and external speakers / headphones. I can hear the sound, very low, if i use my ext. speakers but the pc's own speakers are completely mute
2009-04-17T02:04:00.000Z	juaco	Waldir	mmm try in a terminal running "alsamixer"
2009-04-17T02:04:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	anyway, I don't see how I could've swapped anything, do you mean something like connecting the ext. speakers to the wrong jack? or something software related?
2009-04-17T02:04:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	already tried alsamixer, I only have one bar, "master", and it is full (100)
2009-04-17T02:05:00.000Z	juaco	Waldir	if you press tab it'll show you other channels
2009-04-17T02:05:00.000Z	Waldir		also, it says card:PulseAudio, I'm not sure this is meant to be... but still, it doesnt work on windows either
2009-04-17T02:06:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	I only have "master" and "capture"
2009-04-17T02:06:00.000Z	juaco		that's what i suggested indeed, it has happened to me to plug non-amplified speakers to "line-out" and ending with no amplification at all
2009-04-17T02:07:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	I doubt this was it since it started happening earlier today, while I had no speakers connected
2009-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	juaco		waldir, maybe it's an error with pulseaudio try restarting it. Have you rebooted and the problem persists?
2009-04-17T02:08:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	yes, and in windows too :(
2009-04-17T02:10:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	i suspect it might have to do with me turning off the sound with the laptop's integrated volume knob while ubuntu was starting earlier today, to avoid playing the logon sound since i was in a class. this is the only unusual sound-related thing I recall doing prior to this happening..
2009-04-17T02:11:00.000Z	juaco	Waldir	have you tried opening the GUI mixer?
2009-04-17T02:12:00.000Z	juaco		it has two tabs
2009-04-17T02:12:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	alsamixergui? or the volume control?
2009-04-17T02:12:00.000Z	juaco		volume control
2009-04-17T02:12:00.000Z	Waldir		two tabs?
2009-04-17T02:13:00.000Z	juaco		one tab has all the sliders for each channel, the other one should say "switches" or something like that
2009-04-17T02:13:00.000Z	Waldir	juaco	aargh... I gotta leave for a sec, brb
