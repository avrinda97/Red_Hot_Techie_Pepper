2007-05-24T14:41:00.000Z	DarthShrine		My laptop has the Intel 945GM chipset, but the integrated sound does not work (it's a laptop). The driver is loaded and whatnot, and I'm pretty sure it's not muted. What else could be wrong?
2007-05-24T14:42:00.000Z	DarthShrine		(Yay, I managed to mention it's a laptop twice >_>)
2007-05-24T14:43:00.000Z	brylie	DarthShrine	you have checked the system volume control by double clicking the speaker icon next to the clock?
2007-05-24T14:44:00.000Z	DarthShrine	brylie	Yeap, nothing is muted.
2007-05-24T14:49:00.000Z	brylie	DarthShrine	is your soundcard listed under Device Manager?
2007-05-24T14:49:00.000Z	DarthShrine	brylie	Where is the Device Manager hiding?

2007-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	DarthShrine	brylie	I've tried Rhythmbox for my music, but none of the system sounds work either.
2007-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	DarthShrine	brylie	Also, even low-level tests like noise don't work.

2007-05-24T16:13:00.000Z	DarthShrine	brylie	Re my sound prob, I had to add "options snd-hda-intel model=3stack" to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base. It doesn't work through the headphones though.
