2011-07-19T01:57:00.000Z	gribouille		ubuntu screwed my X configuration. now, the 1280x1024 screen resolution isn't available any more. what should I do ?
2011-07-19T01:58:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	 can you change the resolution using "Monitor"??? or use the command line utility, use xrandr to see what capabilities your monitor can use currently
2011-07-19T01:59:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	xrandr says the maximum resolution is 1024x768. but previously, I used 1280x1024
2011-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	you might want to reconfigure X or you can manually configure your xorg so that you can use the resolution you want, I suggest you try reconfiguring X first
2011-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	how ?
2011-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	how what ?
2011-07-19T02:01:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	reconfigure X
2011-07-19T02:02:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	you need to put that in the form of a question LoL  no, seriously ask again all in one line, hopefully someone will know how to do it if not I can dig up some documentation, ive never done that in 11.04
2011-07-19T02:03:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	how can I reconfigure X?

2011-07-19T02:05:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	I did that countless times, and it didn't change anything
2011-07-19T02:05:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesn't ask me any question
2011-07-19T02:06:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	did you use sudo ?
2011-07-19T02:06:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	of course I did
2011-07-19T02:08:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	 you might have to log in using just text mode OR hit ctrl-alt-f1, log in and try it again
2011-07-19T02:09:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	do you mean I should quit X ?
2011-07-19T02:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	hit CTRL-ALT-F1  then log in
2011-07-19T02:11:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	I did that and ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but nothing happened
2011-07-19T02:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	how did your resolution get borked ?
2011-07-19T02:12:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	I didn't do anything. ubuntu did it all
2011-07-19T02:13:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	something happened and your resolution got change, what happened??? ubuntu cant turn your computer on by itself
2011-07-19T02:14:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	but I didn't do anything special. I just booted my computer as usual
2011-07-19T02:17:00.000Z	tucemiux	gribouille	update your computer and reboot to safe mode
2011-07-19T02:19:00.000Z	gribouille	tucemiux	why ?
