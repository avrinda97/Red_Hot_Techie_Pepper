2006-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	kickfacce	orbin	could it be something to do with the nvidia drivers i have installed? i read something about others having issues on ubuntu similar
2006-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	orbin	kickfacce	possibly.  i'm neither an nvidia owner nor a linux gamer, so i doubt i could help you. sorry
2006-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	kickfacce	orbin	any ideas of channels i could get help in specific gaming on ubuntu?
2006-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	orbin	kickfacce	forum section on gaming is a good bet
