2010-03-04T05:17:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	Welcome to ubuntu support, this is a support chat channel for ubuntu , when asking questions please be specific and provide details of your problem so we can help
2010-03-04T05:19:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	what are you using to setup the dual-display?
2010-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	do you have nvidia-settings installed? .. you will need to run it as superuser by typing gksudo nvidia-settings into a terminal
2010-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	but before you do that let's check a few things
2010-03-04T05:23:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	answer my last question?
2010-03-04T05:23:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	then sudo nvidia-xconfig from command line
2010-03-04T05:25:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	it is a application that is provided by nvidia and the community... if you type "gksudo nvidia-settings" into a terminal ... tell me what happens after you enter your password
2010-03-04T05:28:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	not wierd, kinda cool... now see if it will detect your dispalys ... set it up for your dual displays and save the configuration to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-03-04T05:29:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	then logout and log back in and see if you get 2 screens
2010-03-04T05:30:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	now... goto a new terminal and type sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-03-04T05:32:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	you with me?
2010-03-04T05:33:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	 do not paste here ... use paste.ubuntu.com to paste
2010-03-04T05:34:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	did you run sudo nvidia-xconfig
2010-03-04T05:35:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	close nvidia-settings, and run gksudo nvidia-settings again
2010-03-04T05:38:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	continue the process... detect, setup dual-screens, then save to /etc/X11/xorg.conf  ... the first X is caps the second isn't
2010-03-04T05:38:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	do you get an error now?
2010-03-04T05:40:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	 log out and log back in
2010-03-04T05:40:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	yep, save your work
2010-03-04T05:41:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	same way you did to find this channel
2010-03-04T05:44:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	yep
2010-03-04T05:48:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	now, you are going to have to do some playing around with the nvidia-settings, and I won't be able to help you with that, but all that can be controlled from that application... gksudo nvidia-settings is your friend... note nvidia likes the primary moniter to be on the left (from my expierence)
2010-03-04T05:52:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	you can manually edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and make Screen0 be Screen1 and Screen1 be Screen0 and you should be fixed
2010-03-04T06:02:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	I have other responsibilities... I got you started, the only way you are going to learn at this point is to do it yourself... hint: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-03-04T06:04:00.000Z	GeekSquid	garrett_	on your ipod problem, make sure you have libgpod4 installed, also see codecs
