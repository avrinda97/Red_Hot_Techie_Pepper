2009-11-13T10:09:00.000Z	Blue1	mohan_	I seem to remember an idle timeout parm - but I don't remember where when I set it --
2009-11-13T10:11:00.000Z	mohan_	Blue1	i changed ssh_config, uncommented ConnectTimeout 0
2009-11-13T10:11:00.000Z	Blue1	mohan_	I think that is it...
2009-11-13T10:11:00.000Z	mohan_	Blue1	but it didnt solve the issue

2009-11-13T10:12:00.000Z	mohan_	Blue1	there is nothing like that in ssh_config
2009-11-13T10:12:00.000Z	Blue1	mohan_	:-(
