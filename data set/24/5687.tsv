2006-05-27T14:08:00.000Z	EmxBA		hi everyone again
2006-05-27T14:08:00.000Z	EmxBA		i have a very strange problem with apt
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	EmxBA		anyone? i tried to install some .deb packaged from debian dvd but they have unmet dependencies
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	EmxBA		so now when i want to apt-get install *something* i must download 40MB :( but i have only dialup connection
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	add the DVD as an APT source with 'apt-cdrom' and use 'apt' to install them.
2006-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	but it takes too long to scan dvd
2006-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	obviously you are a very advanced guru so you fully understand the implications of mixing binaries from Ubuntu and Debian...
2006-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	don't be like that! I didn't understand till now
2006-05-27T14:38:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	thanks for advice before ~20 minutes ago. My poor Celeron could not handle so many processes, and too small 256 MB of RAM, i waited approx. 20 minutes to scan index files on Debian DVD, and my disk got crazy running. Only solution was RESTART. *Please, don't ignore this, try to solve my problem. I will explain it in details if needed. Anyway, thanks :D :D :D
2006-05-27T14:39:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	you can make the CDROM a lost faster if you tell 'apt-cdrom' not to do an exhaustive scan
2006-05-27T14:40:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	how to do that, for god sake
2006-05-27T14:41:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	'man apt-get' lists the various options, I think you might want to use '-f'
2006-05-27T14:44:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	that was 'man apt-cdrom'....
2006-05-27T14:44:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	i was wondering how to add Debian DVD and fix my broken dependencies
2006-05-27T14:45:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	of course I am a bit surprised that someone who fully understands the dangers of mixing Debian and Ubuntu packages has forgotten the options of 'apt-cdrom' :-)
2006-05-27T14:46:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	i could be rude as you, but I don't want that
2006-05-27T14:47:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	if you want, we could speak nicely on PM, really
2006-05-27T14:57:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	now i have added Debian DVD. But i  type apt-get install -f and it againg needs to download ~40 MB, but I'm pretty sure that all those packages are on Debian DVD...what to do???
2006-05-27T14:58:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	evidently there are newer versions of packages online than on the DVD...
2006-05-27T14:58:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	what you can do is to comment out the network-based repositories in '/etc/apt/sources.list'
2006-05-27T14:59:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	OK, i'll try that
2006-05-27T14:59:00.000Z	Blissex	EmxBA	note that I am still assuming that you know exactly what you are doing and the likely consequences...
2006-05-27T14:59:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	don't worry
2006-05-27T15:28:00.000Z	EmxBA	Blissex	just a tip: when you uncomment previously commented network repositories you must run apt-get update again
