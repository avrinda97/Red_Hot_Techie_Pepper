2011-06-01T00:23:00.000Z	mbnoimi		where can I request to add new software in ubuntu repositories?
2011-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	chances are it will fall on deaf ears unless you package it yourself...
2011-06-01T00:25:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	you mean I've to package it by myself in launchpad.net
2011-06-01T00:25:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	I think you can submit a bug as a feature request. I am not sure. But the best way to get something included is to make a package and then submit it.
2011-06-01T00:28:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	damn, there is a huge gap in Winrar alternative in ubuntu I discuss it with KDE community and I found that best thing is to request to add q7z in ubutnu repository (q7z exists in openSuSE repository)... see kde discussion http://tinyurl.com/3cl3cn4
2011-06-01T00:29:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	what do you need winrar for?
2011-06-01T00:31:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	usually in winrar the user can set compression ratio where in Ark it can't be so the user forced to use peazip or q7z where both of them not exist in ubuntu repositories
2011-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	are you try to make a rar file? why does it matter if you can set a compression ratio?
2011-06-01T00:32:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	also, what program do you recommend ubuntu get?
2011-06-01T00:33:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	I want to create 7z file with hightest compression (9), this can done from CLI where it can't in GUI
2011-06-01T00:34:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	interesting. what program do you want to install?
2011-06-01T00:34:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=45453
2011-06-01T00:35:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	see this discussion too http://tinyurl.com/3cl3cn4
2011-06-01T00:37:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	I guess you should file a bug. I think when you file a bug you can mark it as an enhancement. However, I think it is unlikely someone will take it :-\
2011-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	or, you can file a bug with ark upstream...
2011-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	that is more likely to be handled ;-)
2011-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	yes, thanks for suggestion
2011-06-01T00:38:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	you can also make your own then go into the ubuntu dev channel and ask for someone to review/submit it. Sort of a mentorship thing.
2011-06-01T00:39:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	they tend to like to do that ;-)
2011-06-01T00:39:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	or you just compile by source and not try... but it helps the community when you fix it for everyone :-D
2011-06-01T00:40:00.000Z	mbnoimi	smw	unfortunately I don't have any experience in building deb packages.... I read tons of resource but I found them very compicated
2011-06-01T00:40:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	it is far too complicated... arch packages are so much easier :-P
2011-06-01T00:41:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	I have made rpms, debs, and arch linux packages. But I have too many projects on my plate to help with this :-\
2011-06-01T00:43:00.000Z	smw	mbnoimi	Dulak is correct. They are just compressed tar files (I don't believe they use gz for compression anymore)
