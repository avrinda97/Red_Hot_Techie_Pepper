2005-08-07T09:53:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		doesnt change the fact that it doesnt
2005-08-07T09:54:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		yeah mplayer plays EVERYTHING - except - these friggen .mp4 files
2005-08-07T09:55:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	compile it with libfaad
2005-08-07T09:55:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	nalioth	 would that be included in apt-get build-dep mplayer-686 ??
2005-08-07T09:56:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	it's been my (personal and in helping others) experience that compiling mplayer is the best route to the most compatibility
2005-08-07T09:56:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	nalioth	 i compiled it... it still doesnt run tho, heh
2005-08-07T09:57:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	and i recommend you d/l all the codecs/libs via apt, compile the ones not available in apt, and d/l hte source from mplayerhq and compile it with flags of your choice
2005-08-07T09:57:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	nalioth	 yeah did all that
2005-08-07T09:58:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	then i dont know anything else
2005-08-07T09:58:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	you need libfaad for mp4s/aac
2005-08-07T09:59:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	you also need gstreamer-libfaad (or whatever it's called)
2005-08-07T10:01:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	changing from totem-xine to totem-gstreamer aint but a thang
2005-08-07T10:01:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	install ALL gstreamer plugins
2005-09-01T11:13:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	is that what you are lookin for ?
2005-09-01T11:15:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	dont you mean my dog?
2005-09-01T11:17:00.000Z	nalioth	PurpleMotion	yep, just a script
