2006-12-18T12:01:00.000Z	Yodabunny		got Orion II working on it but it's VERY slow
2006-12-18T12:01:00.000Z	Yodabunny		mostly a driver problem, I have a crappy vid card in it and I can't get DRI to work
2006-12-18T12:02:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I hope so
2006-12-18T12:02:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I think vista might help with that
2006-12-18T12:04:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I prefer linux.  I'd use it exclusively if I could run all of the software I use
2006-12-18T12:04:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I'll never install vista
2006-12-18T12:04:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I reinstall too often and swap hardware quite often
2006-12-18T12:06:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I'd be happy if Linux had vid drivers for my last few pcs
2006-12-18T12:07:00.000Z	Yodabunny		I think the biggest problem holding back Linux adoption is having to touch the command line
2006-12-18T12:07:00.000Z	Yodabunny		And drivers etc
2006-12-18T12:07:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	But you don't need to touch the cli at all.
2006-12-18T12:08:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	Well, maybe *you* do, but people that need mail/web/word processing don't.
2006-12-18T12:09:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	you're right, but a lot of people need more than that
2006-12-18T12:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	You'd be amaed how many people don't need more though... and they all buy windows... and office...
2006-12-18T12:11:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	not disputing that at all.  Problem is they don't know that's all they need.  The second they can't do something without a tech friend they'll switch
2006-12-18T12:11:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	Yeah, that's no reason to pick windows instead. Most of these popel that I know also can't manage windows without help.
2006-12-18T12:13:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	it is a reason, a very good one.  Windows despite all of it's faults babies you through those problems.  There are a lot it can't fix, but the important (from a user perspective) ones it does.
2006-12-18T12:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	I'm talking about people who can NOT run through a wizard by themselves.
2006-12-18T12:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	There are LOTS of them... quite sad...
2006-12-18T12:14:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	I agree.  That being said, a lot of people that can go through a wizard can't manage a linux distribution
2006-12-18T12:15:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	But only due to lack of confidence; if there was decentish documentation they'd be fine.
2006-12-18T12:16:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	but most people don't want to know how it works, or figure out how it works, they want it to just work, or at the very least ask them simple questions
2006-12-18T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego	Yodabunny	Yes, a matter of confidence (or possibly even laziness).
2006-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	Yodabunny	cafuego	with linux you generally aren't asked questions, it's not neccessarily linux's issue, it's usually the hardware/software providers issue, but the user doesn't care about that
