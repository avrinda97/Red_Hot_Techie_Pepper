2006-10-27T05:06:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	no need to repeat yourself
2006-10-27T05:07:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	nope, you're just in a room with 1023 people at last count...it's kind of busy
2006-10-27T05:07:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	listen dude.. being in a room of 1/2 million people wouldn't help me more than this is now...
2006-10-27T05:08:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	have you looking in System->Administration->Networking?
2006-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	if you have a terminal open, and you type "ifconfig" is your stuff there?
2006-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	YES
2006-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	so it indicates that you are on the wireless network?
2006-10-27T05:13:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	any cunning plans??
2006-10-27T05:14:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	still not sure where you're at
2006-10-27T05:14:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	can you use sudo iwconfig to connect to the network from the terminal?
2006-10-27T05:15:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	yes, it can.  it just might not match as well graphically
2006-10-27T05:15:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	....
2006-10-27T05:17:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	soo.. that cunning plan's expiry time is approaching....
2006-10-27T05:18:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	you can use iwconfig to get on the network but Administration->Networking doesn't work?
2006-10-27T05:20:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	open a terminal, type sudo iwconfig <whateveryourinterfaceis> essid hpnetwork
2006-10-27T05:23:00.000Z	djm62	Nox_ville	replacing my obvious nonsense with sense
2006-10-27T05:24:00.000Z	Nox_ville	djm62	bout time... im trying that command now... just reinstalling my piece 'o  crap laptop....
