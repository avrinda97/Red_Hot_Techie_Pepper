2012-01-02T02:44:00.000Z	_Marcus		Is it possible to access my screens from other SSH sessions? It seems I can't atm
2012-01-02T02:44:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	Wuff Wuff is screen's default visual bell.  I have no idea why (probably someone has a sense of humour)
2012-01-02T02:45:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	But can I access my screens from other SSH sessions?
2012-01-02T02:45:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	sure.  screen -rd
2012-01-02T02:46:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	screen -list shows the screens
2012-01-02T02:46:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	it says "No Sockets found in /var/run/screen/S-marcus"
2012-01-02T02:47:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	well, you have no screens running as marcus then
2012-01-02T02:48:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	byobu makes running screen a bit easier (and prettier).  You might want to look at that.  Or have a read of: http://www.bangmoney.org/presentations/screen.html
2012-01-02T02:48:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	But I did "screen java " then stuff to start the jar, that should start the screen right?
2012-01-02T03:00:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	How do I switch through screen sessions?
2012-01-02T03:03:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	two screens are different from two windows in a single screen
2012-01-02T03:05:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	use byobu.  It's the same, but easier and prettier
2012-01-02T03:07:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	that's because you have two screen *sessionss, not two windows.  You'll need to detach from one and attach to the other
2012-01-02T03:09:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	http://www.bangmoney.org/presentations/screen.html
2012-01-02T03:57:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	you have to detach it if it's already attached (-dr)
2012-02-28T01:11:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	I would help him.
2012-03-28T23:23:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04.3/
2012-08-13T20:58:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	chown :<groupname> <filename>
2012-08-13T20:58:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	Thanks
2012-08-13T20:58:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	note the ":", it's significant
2012-08-13T20:58:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	Why?
2012-08-13T20:59:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	alternatively you can use chgrp (which I guess is more specific)
2012-08-13T20:59:00.000Z	ssta	_Marcus	chown changes owner and/or group.  Before the colon is owner, after is group (so chown <owner>:<group> <file>)
2012-08-13T20:59:00.000Z	_Marcus	ssta	Chown worked fine. Thanks :)
