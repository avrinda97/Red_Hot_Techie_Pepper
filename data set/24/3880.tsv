2007-09-21T12:54:00.000Z	roy		I install ubuntu and never been able to install windows again. why?
2007-09-21T12:55:00.000Z	ndube	roy	did you leave unpartitioned space on your hd for windows?
2007-09-21T12:55:00.000Z	roy	ndube	is a new notebook using sata hard disk, it keep saying that no hard disk found
2007-09-21T12:56:00.000Z	ndube		you probably need to download the drivers for the sata controller
2007-09-21T12:56:00.000Z	ndube		and then push f6 during windows setup boot to load the drivers from floppy...
2007-09-21T12:56:00.000Z	roy		how to remove linux file system?
2007-09-21T12:57:00.000Z	ndube	roy	boot up using a live cd and delete all partitions using gparted
2007-09-21T12:57:00.000Z	roy		live cd have gparted?
2007-09-21T12:58:00.000Z	roy		your mean gparted live cd or ubuntu live cd
2007-09-21T12:58:00.000Z	ndube	roy	either one
2007-09-21T12:58:00.000Z	ndube	roy	but you can delete them once you get windows to recognize your hd
2007-09-21T12:59:00.000Z	roy	ndube	had try using gparted live cd to delete away everything but windows still cannot find hd
2007-09-21T13:00:00.000Z	ndube	roy	then windows is more-than-likely not detecting your SATA Controller
2007-09-21T13:01:00.000Z	roy	ndube	think the note book is mean for media centre and not normal XP
2007-09-21T13:01:00.000Z	ndube	roy	media center is just normal xp with addons and additional drivers
2007-09-21T13:02:00.000Z	ndube	roy	what model laptop is it?
2007-09-21T13:02:00.000Z	roy	ndube	but it can detect usb external hard disk. model HP compaq V3000 series
2007-09-21T13:04:00.000Z	ndube	roy	thats because your windows has usb drivers built into the cd
2007-09-21T13:05:00.000Z	ndube	roy	what is the specific model?
2007-09-21T13:07:00.000Z	roy	ndube	HP COMPAQ V3345TU
2007-09-21T13:09:00.000Z	ndube	roy	I would hop over the the ##windows channel and post your question there
2007-09-21T13:10:00.000Z	roy	ndube	think you are right. Because the notebook ship original with Vista, and I am trying to install WInXP on it
2007-09-21T13:10:00.000Z	roy	ndube	my XP CD might not have sata controler support
2007-09-21T13:11:00.000Z	ndube	roy	true...
