2010-04-03T12:06:00.000Z	ugur		Hi all. Does anyone know how to create a multi boot usb pendrive with grub2 and iso bootables?
2010-04-03T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 its doable.. theres guides out on it.. i got links to some at -> http://delicious.com/dr_willis under the grub2 tags
2010-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 its not too hard to do either. :)  install grub2 to thependrive. make a grub.cfg that has the right entries..  copy over iso files. done.
2010-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	ugur		I am using this guide: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/install-grub2-on-usb-from-ubuntu-linux/
2010-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 so whats the exact issue you are having then?
2010-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	ugur		but i cant see grub menu at startup
2010-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	ugur		only a blank screen
2010-04-03T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 the thing is not booting from thependriv?or your  grub.cfg is wrong thenn would bemy guess
2010-04-03T12:09:00.000Z	ugur	Dr_Willis	I double checked the grub.cfg file. Any other guess?
2010-04-03T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 what did you use to make the grub.cfg?  and what filesystem is thependrive?
2010-04-03T12:10:00.000Z	ugur		File system is FAT32
2010-04-03T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 ive bnever used the method that guide uses.. i use other methods. toi let me boot several differnt iso files. I would try a different guide
2010-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	ugur		I installed grub with this command: sudo grub-install --grub-setup=/bin/true --no-floppy --root-directory=/media/MULTI/ /dev/sdb1
2010-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I have 5+ iso files on a pendrive all booting from grub2. works very well for me.
2010-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	ugur		and downloaded grub.cfg from the link in the guide
2010-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 you could of done a mistake in the directions and never put grub on thembr of the pendrive also. its hard to tell
2010-04-03T12:12:00.000Z	ugur	Dr_Willis	Can you recommend another guide that you have used ?
2010-04-03T12:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ugur	 see my delicious.com links i gave above
2010-04-03T12:12:00.000Z	ugur		Ok thanks
