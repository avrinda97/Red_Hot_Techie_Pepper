2011-09-18T20:39:00.000Z	Guest90616		I'm getting this error message from ubuntu server '  is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. '
2011-09-18T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	your user is is not an authorized sudoer, the user needs to be in the "admin" group
2011-09-18T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	is this your machine / do you administrate it
2011-09-18T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	that's not what I asked
2011-09-18T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	is this your server - do you admin it
2011-09-18T20:42:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	yes i am
2011-09-18T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	what happened to the user you setup when the machine was installed
2011-09-18T20:43:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	but i have never have this problem its a fresh installed server . I think i type into different user names
2011-09-18T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	what happened to the user you setup when you installed the server
2011-09-18T20:45:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	it ask me what user name you want it to be i type enter as X and then it ask me again I type in Y
2011-09-18T20:45:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	would u recommened me to reboot the server and go into recovery mode and do a sudo adduser  x admin
2011-09-18T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	the user needs to be in the admin group, put it in how you feel confortable
2011-09-18T20:46:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	is there anyway i can find out how many user is created in the admin group in ubuntu server?
2011-09-18T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	it only creates 1
2011-09-18T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	hence why your user is not in it
2011-09-18T20:48:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	i have no single clue,  i can't even do sudo shutdown -r on a ssh it said : shutdown: Need to be root
2011-09-18T20:48:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	oh wait .. does landscape affects the way
2011-09-18T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	correct, because you need to be in the admin group - put the user in the admin group
2011-09-18T20:48:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	i remember now i have it manage by landscape something, does that affect how i sudo/admin rights?
2011-09-18T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	you're not listening,
2011-09-18T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	you've been told
2011-09-18T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	you need to add the user you are using to the admin group
2011-09-18T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest90616	you need to do this from a recovery shell OR the user you setup the system with when you first installed it
2011-09-18T21:04:00.000Z	Guest90616	ikonia	i'm already in reocvery shell
