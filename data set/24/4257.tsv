2007-06-16T10:40:00.000Z	newchris		sorry for the repeat: i think that grub has overwritten the first 100mb or so of my documents drive (hdc1), how can i recover as much of the previous data as possible?
2007-06-16T10:41:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	why would grub do that, and what makes you think it?
2007-06-16T10:41:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	when i mount it (it should be a 110gb partition) all i see is a bunch of grub-related files, and it says the drive is about 100mb big
2007-06-16T10:43:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	how is /dev/hdc partitioned?
2007-06-16T10:44:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	just one big ext3 partition
2007-06-16T10:45:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	how are you mounting it?
2007-06-16T10:46:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	/dev/hdc1 /media/backup ext3 defaults,users 0 0
2007-06-16T10:46:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	oh, is that from /etc/fstab?
2007-06-16T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	when you run 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdc', does it show just the one partition? What size?
2007-06-16T10:50:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	/dev/hdc1 start 1 end 14916 blocks 120053713+ id 83 system Linux
2007-06-16T10:51:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	that looks fine
2007-06-16T10:51:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	yes. What does 'df -h' say about /dev/hdc1 ?
2007-06-16T10:52:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	Size 99M used 16M Avail 79M use% 17% Mounted on /media/backup
2007-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	this is what i don't understand. i know the partition's bigger than 100mb :-S
2007-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	is there any cherished data on that disk?
2007-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	nothing lifethreatening but everything i've ever written for school, and everything i've ever pirated, haha. i CAN live without the data but i'd want to exhaust all the possibilities first
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	I'm not sure what the best strategy is. You could backup the entire drive block-by-block with dd, but you'd need 120GB of space...
2007-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	you could also unmount and run e2fsck on it, but it's possible that you'll lose data if you let it "repair" stuff.
2007-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	i can boost a hdd from somewhere else to back it up, how would i do it?
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	'cd /directory/with/lotsofspace ; sudo dd if=/dev/hdc of=hdc-image'
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	if=/dev/hdc or if=/dev/hdc1 ?
2007-06-16T11:01:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	/dev/hdc (as this will save the entire hard disk, including the partition table and master boot record)
2007-06-16T11:01:00.000Z	newchris	soundray	cool i just wanted to check - battery on laptop is about to die :-) cheers for all your help, will give e2fsck a go after backing it up. nice one :-)
2007-06-16T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	newchris	another thing you could try is to look at it with gparted, see if you note anything strange
