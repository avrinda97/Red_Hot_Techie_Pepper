2010-05-20T05:00:00.000Z	CT1		I need one of 2 things, either 1: To resolve getting a black screen when login to ubuntu, or 2:  to burn a dmg file to a bootable dvd.  It's a macbook 2.1.  Hard disk ruined and need either (preferably) ubuntu working, or a way to burn the dmg file to boot and install os x.  Please help
2010-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	 if the HD is hosed, how do you plan to install either? :)
2010-05-20T05:02:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Replaced it with a new one (with os x absent ofc, and destroyed apple optical media) :)
2010-05-20T05:04:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	 not sure on 10.04, but with the 9.1 live-cd, you can make a 'startup usb', with which you can do a live-usb boot, which should allow  you to burn the .dmg image to the dvd disc in the dvd burner :)
2010-05-20T05:07:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	 I'd think the burning app in the live-boot will do the .dmg, isn't it just an image?
2010-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	some "mental" mac format.  I've converted it to an img with dmg2img.  Can I burn that (bootable)?
2010-05-20T05:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	  sure
2010-05-20T05:26:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	 yes
2010-05-20T05:11:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Does Brasero "see" img files?
2010-05-20T05:12:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	  I think so, I use k3b, but I don't think that should be an issue, worse case scenario, you can always use 'dd'
2010-05-20T05:12:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	  'dd' uses whatever
2010-05-20T05:15:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Far too complex for me.  I just wanted a working laptop. and before the hdd went all "free style percussion" on me I had both os x and ubuntu(mainly) working fine.  Now nothing : (
2010-05-20T05:15:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	  so, use Brassero to burn it then :)
2010-05-20T05:16:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	I'll try it.  Thanks for your support.
2010-05-20T05:24:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Are you back?
2010-05-20T05:28:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Great.  So far so good.  Brasero didn't complain when I selected an img file (although to see it I had to select "all files" as "image files" didn't show it.  also, the "free space" changed after I selected it.  We'll see in 16min.  Thanks for the help :)
2010-05-20T05:29:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	  hehe, it'll work, burning an image is just a simple 'raw writing'
2010-05-20T05:30:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	 which is what 'dd' is great at, raw writing/reading, bypassing any filesystem or OS
2010-05-20T05:33:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	"simple" is relative.  I'll be sure to read up on dd some day, when I cross the line of being an end-user (that occasionally helps a family friend with their computer) to being a serious technician.  Again though, thankyou :)
2010-05-20T05:50:00.000Z	Typos_King	CT1	   <banging drums>
2010-05-20T05:43:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	3min for that img.  I'll keep you posted.  Hope it's not a ruined dvd+r dl.
2010-05-20T05:47:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	"Finalising"... moment of truth.
2010-05-20T05:52:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	'Tworks mate. 'tworks a treat!  THANYOU :)  Now, hopefully I can get ubuntu working again.  Thanks for your time and help!
2010-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	CT1	Typos_King	Goodnight (or day?) to you.  I'm off to bring this macbuntu back from the dead.
