2007-04-04T16:21:00.000Z	awesomess3		hello everyone I have an Ubuntu HP Pavilion ze5700 laptop.  I took all of the screws out, but it still doesn't open!!  ggrrr!  Can someone help? :)))
2007-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	but why? why open a laptop?
2007-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	The power connector is loose and I was thinking about saudering it back to the mother board, or replacing the jack that holds the power connector to the mother board.
2007-04-04T16:24:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	humm. you might need a spudger, if it has locking tabs or something.
2007-04-04T16:32:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	Use the spudger to open the lap top if it has something like locking tabs?
2007-04-04T16:33:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	yes. are there seams where two sections of platic meet? a spudger is a small platic screwdriver/wedge that's gentle on plastic.
2007-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	Yes there is a plastic piece!  It's on the part of the laptop that is hard to open, so I bet that's it!  I tried using my mechanical pencil to open it up...I'll try something else lol
2007-04-04T16:37:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	Ok I got a sharp compass and it's pulling a little out, so this is good!  I tried it from the side...or should I try to pull it out from the top?...I'll keep experimenting :)
2007-04-04T16:38:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	no idea. :)  My ibook is all good, thanks to some online breakdown guide I found for it.  I even managed to replace the screen frame hinge. (Quite the feat, and PITA)
2007-04-04T16:39:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	I think one of the engineering problems that HP, Apple, etc. face is... "how are we going to make this as difficult as possible for the consumer to take apart?" :)
2007-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	lol. I think that's pretty much the design goal of anyone.
2007-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	I have done the impossible!!
2007-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	time to get some coffee :)
2007-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	Now I'm onto another problem on the opposite side of the laptop, it seems to not want to budge, this is interesting!
2007-04-04T16:49:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	double check for screws. even if they hide under a label.
2007-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	well the edge is right next to the DVD player, so I'd guess I might have to take the DVD player out first.
2007-04-04T16:56:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	ahhh. the ibook has three, yea THREE obnoxious plastic tab interlocks above the dvd drive. maybe hp stole that idea to.
2007-04-04T05:10:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	What if you're trying to open up the laptop with the spudger..and you think there is tab there..and you feel that you're pulling so hard that plastic might break...what do you do? lol
2007-04-04T05:41:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	*puts dynamite into the laptop and blows it up*
2007-04-04T05:41:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	gimmie first! :-X
2007-04-04T05:42:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	Well it's a friends, so if I gave it away they might get upset :( lol
2007-04-04T05:43:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	but TNT is ok hum?
2007-04-04T05:44:00.000Z	awesomess3	Supaplex	At least I have something to give back
2007-04-04T05:44:00.000Z	Supaplex	awesomess3	a heap of parts ;)
