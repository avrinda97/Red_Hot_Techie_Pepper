2006-04-11T11:51:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	what video card do you have?
2006-04-11T11:51:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	did it finish booting?
2006-04-11T11:53:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	what version of ubuntu is the CD?
2006-04-11T11:53:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	5.10
2006-04-11T11:54:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	hrm.. Not sure what to suggest. Without knowing what the error message is that is.
2006-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	i know, was worth a try heh. i can't seem to see the actual error code tho as the font seems crazy
2006-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	try it without the virtual pc.. if you can get the error message then it'd really help
2006-04-11T11:56:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	right, i'll be back soon....i hope
2006-04-11T12:11:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	i got as much of the error msg as i could
2006-04-11T12:12:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	ok
2006-04-11T12:13:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	 ^^
2006-04-11T12:15:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	well, there's 2 options
2006-04-11T12:16:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	 you can either try actually installing with an install CD on a separate partition or you can burn a live CD of dapper
2006-04-11T12:17:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	the next version of ubuntu it's not technically "stable" but it works pretty well
2006-04-11T12:17:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	and might have better support for your card
2006-04-11T12:17:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	where could i get the live cd of that from? :)
2006-04-11T12:19:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	for dapper http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/releases/dapper/flight-6/
2006-04-11T12:19:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	ubotu sent you a message about dualboot
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	if you are installing it though I'd recommend trying breezy first
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	the current stable version of ubuntu
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	5.10
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	I was just suggesting dapper for the Live CD
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	polpak	Eyel-e-ss	if you didn't want to install just yet
2006-04-11T12:21:00.000Z	Eyel-e-ss	polpak	thanks for your time and i hope to see u here when i get it all workin :)
