2007-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	^rob^		i am trying to install mysql server-4.1 from deb package and i get
2007-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	^rob^		dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/mysql-server-4.1_4.1.15-1ubuntu5_i386.deb (--unpack):
2007-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	^rob^		 subprocess pre-installation script returned error exit status 1
2007-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	^rob^		what the heck is that?
2007-03-06T15:55:00.000Z	^rob^		i did apt-get clean - redo the procedure - same error
2007-03-06T15:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Can I ask why from a deb package?
2007-03-06T15:56:00.000Z	^rob^	gyaresu	i mean ubuntu repo
2007-03-06T15:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	so you want to add feisty repo to edgy right?
2007-03-06T15:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	bcochofel K. So rob why are you  installing from a .deb and why does bcochofel need a feisty repo?
2007-03-06T15:59:00.000Z	^rob^	gyaresu	I AM INSTALLING WITH APT-GET!! grr
2007-03-06T16:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Right so you apt-get removed  and then apt-cache clean'd and still no joy.
2007-03-06T16:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Yeah but before clean. Did you do 'remove'.
2007-03-06T16:03:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	apt-get -f install ??
2007-03-06T16:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Lot's of google links. I assume you've seen?
2007-03-06T16:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	That's the spirit!
2007-03-06T16:06:00.000Z	^rob^	gyaresu	i did - it's a package mess
2007-03-06T16:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	(Without looking) Is it something special you've done with versions?
2007-03-06T16:07:00.000Z	^rob^	gyaresu	no - it's a fresh installed server from dedicatedcentral.com
2007-03-06T16:08:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Ah. Ok so you've bought a server.
2007-03-06T16:09:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	K. Well you'know. Same same, but something is foobar'd if a clean install is wacking out on just a mysql install.
2007-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	gyaresu	^rob^	Now now. Lot's of others have so can you think of anything you might have done non-standard and could you post the last of the error message.
2007-03-06T16:12:00.000Z	^rob^	gyaresu	yeah - i did : apt-get update... apt-get install mysql-server-4.1
