2005-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	socomm		Anyone having issues with java on hoary?
2005-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	are you installing it from a download from java.com, or a precompiled binary for ubuntu
2005-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	socomm	rm6990	Sun.com
2005-01-12T09:40:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	which java version, 1.5 update 1 or 1.4.6?
2005-01-12T09:40:00.000Z	socomm		java version "1.4.2_05"
2005-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	socomm		Java never launches the applets or applications.
2005-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	rm6990		sorry, not 1.4.6....i meant 1.4.2_06....you should also upgrade to that, it has a security patch not applied in 1.4.2_05
2005-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	is it in ur path?
2005-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	socomm		Yes only been having problems as of this afternoon, when I dist_upgraded hoary.
2005-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	that is the reason i stick with warty...java is important for me with school and it has a tendancy to break easily so i try to stay with stable versions of distros
2005-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	socomm	rm6990	Fortunately Java isn't that important for me, I just wanted to use azureus and play some java games.
2005-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	socomm		I'm gonna install _06 see if that fixes things.
2005-01-12T09:45:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	i do my school thru correspondance at this point in time, and a lot of it is done online (much better than snail mail) and with my physics courses all of the little interactive demos are written in java
2005-01-12T09:45:00.000Z	rm6990		i guess it could be worse, they could have been written in .NET or some other proprietary MS format
2005-01-12T09:46:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	go to www.java.com, it is easier to find then on sun's site
2005-01-12T09:46:00.000Z	socomm	rm6990	I've all ready downloading, extracting as we chat.
2005-01-12T09:46:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	lol, n/m then
2005-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	socomm		Bleh. No dice.
2005-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	what is it doing?
2005-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	rm6990		maybe a library that java relies on is currently broken in hoary?
2005-01-12T09:50:00.000Z	socomm		It just loads up the executable in to memory and stalls in the run process.
2005-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	rm6990		what does it show in the terminal, post in into pastebin
2005-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	socomm		java -cp :Azureus2.jar:swt-mozilla.jar:swt-pi.jar:swt.jar -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/bin org.gudy.azureus2.ui.swt.Main ''
2005-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	rm6990	socomm	have u tried more than just azureus in java?
