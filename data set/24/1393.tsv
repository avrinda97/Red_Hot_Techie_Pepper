2011-02-17T02:37:00.000Z	stephans		does anyone know when a fix for nm-applet will be out? I have a huge issue with mem leak... and when I went to post the issue in ubuntus ticket system there were already lots of others that had done so... This is a bad problem. 1.5 GIG after leaving the pc on for a day...
2011-02-17T02:38:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	how did you measure the "leak"?
2011-02-17T02:38:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	by watching it in top for instance
2011-02-17T02:39:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	but, to answer your question, there is a network manager ppa that has updated stuff, but what you're seeing probably isn't a leak; a lot of people think a slowly growing VM size is a leak
2011-02-17T02:39:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	well there is an end :] try looking how much memory it's actually using with smem
2011-02-17T02:39:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	ok I will... but it does reach the point where the computer is unusable
2011-02-17T02:40:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	suffice it to say the VM size is a useless number, it's really only something useful to track large and quick changes, it doesn't convey any actual information about memory use
2011-02-17T02:42:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	nm-applet is using 4.7 megs here, bur top says 287m virt, it's a big gap
2011-02-17T02:43:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	OK... I have smem now... will check
2011-02-17T02:43:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	free -m will show you how much swap is in use; if its becoming unusuable after a while and swap is full, it's probably something other than this
2011-02-17T02:44:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	got it
2011-02-17T02:45:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	if it _is_ swapping, iotop will tell you the programs that are being paged in/out
2011-02-17T02:46:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	iotop? Ok I will have to look for that one! sounds usefull...
2011-02-17T02:47:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	it could be that you just don't have enough memory for your average working set though; if that's the case you'll need more, or find a way to weed out stuff you don't really need
2011-02-17T02:50:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	nm-applet --sm-disable             0   713772   714402   724244
2011-02-17T02:51:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	seems a little over the top to me
2011-02-17T02:51:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	no pun intended
2011-02-17T02:51:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	nice, so it is really going nuts, do you have wifi & is it constantly trying to connect? or vpn or any other "interesting" connection types
2011-02-17T02:53:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	well I do have wifi... on a lenovo T400... I usually have Hide My Ass (HMA)running bu not now...
2011-02-17T02:54:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	HMA uses the Open VPN even under windows and mac...
2011-02-17T02:55:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	would continuous connect attempts mess up nm-applet?
2011-02-17T02:55:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	well, i didn't mean hma in particular; i mean like disable wifi scanning if you're not using wifi, disable other connection types and see if it goes away
2011-02-17T02:56:00.000Z	ohsix	stephans	anything that's done over and over could magnify a small leak
2011-02-17T02:58:00.000Z	stephans	ohsix	OK i will sleuth around and see... i have installed several items... even some KDE stuff, mybe that would include net software conflicting. Also I installed a Bank ID app for smart cards and tried to force it to work in my 64 bit ubuntu even if only 32 bit was supported... I had to replace some crypto libs.. which may ofcourse be in use by wifi...
