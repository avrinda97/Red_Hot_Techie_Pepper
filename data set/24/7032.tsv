2005-10-19T16:48:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		okay guys
2005-10-19T16:49:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		i JUST replaced my entire ubuntu installatiomn with a fresh install of the stable 5.10 -- the AMD64 version...  and i just finished adding all my upgrade components too...
2005-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		i,m now running AMD64 2.5 gigahertz with 4 gig of ram and a 300gig primary SATA drive
2005-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		jratter:  dude, relax...  EVERYBODY is pulling at that speed because EVERYBODY is tryuing to grab that same iso
2005-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		jratter:  you wanna go faster?  use bittorent
2005-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		okjay guys heres the 25 million dollar quiz question....  are the repositories totally different for the AMD64 version?
2005-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	Repositories? No. Binaries, yes
2005-10-19T16:53:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	josh43	 so that means my sources.liust file should contain the regular breezy repositories?
2005-10-19T16:53:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	Yes, mine do and I have no issues (well, no REPOSITORY issues ;)
2005-10-19T05:00:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	Yes and yes
2005-10-19T05:00:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	I mean; no and yes, respectivly ;)
2005-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	You can also compile from source; it's no big deal
2005-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	josh43	 ive never compiled anything from source....  if i wanted that kind of headdache id install Fedora and NEVER get anything done
2005-10-19T05:03:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	I used to think that way too, but it's easy.. just 3 commands: ./configure, make, make install
2005-10-19T05:23:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	It's the driver backend for your video player
2005-10-19T05:23:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	If you know what codecs are in windows, it's very similar
2005-10-19T05:24:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	You are on amd64 ubuntu, correct?
2005-10-19T05:24:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	josh43	 yes
2005-10-19T05:25:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	Well, I'm doing it through xine with the ffmpeg drivers, but that's still not 100%
2005-10-19T05:26:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	cafuego Brings up a good point: install all the gstreamer packages
2005-10-19T05:27:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	sorry.. a64 and mplayer is a no-go
2005-10-19T05:29:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	If you need it to read everything windows does, go to ubuntu 32
2005-10-19T05:30:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	You and me both ;)
2005-10-19T05:30:00.000Z	josh43	shadeofgrey	Or, ask everyone to use open-source codecs ;)
