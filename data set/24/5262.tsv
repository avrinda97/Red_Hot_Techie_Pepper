2006-09-13T16:49:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	output: there is a command that can configure twinview something like nvidia --reconfigure --twinview. are you familiar with this ootput?
2006-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	i want it to be prettymuch like windows. one off to the side, so just drag stuff between them
2006-09-13T16:54:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	i did xinerama and its kinda like that
2006-09-13T16:56:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	no... you have to change your xorg.conf file
2006-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	ootput, thanks ill look into xinerama and will probly be back if i need more help. for now i need to go
2006-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	you will need to find your max and min screen resolutions for each monitor. Same with the refresh rates. to get those you can search all over the place or you can do this command with one monitor hooked up then do the other monitor: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2006-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	your xorg.conf file is in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-09-13T16:58:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	yeah
2006-09-13T16:59:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	 ill look up the min/max reso and refresh rates in the manuals or something
2006-09-13T16:59:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	 yeah will do
2006-09-13T16:59:00.000Z	blinky	gbrent	ootput, ive gotta go. thanks for the help
2006-09-13T05:09:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	looks like you are having permissions denied on your temp firectory
2006-09-13T05:09:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	no i am lost with that perhaps ootput may have an idea
2006-09-13T05:10:00.000Z	gbrent	blinky	what are the permissions on your /tmp dir?
