2005-04-24T08:41:00.000Z	LISP		i prefer mplayer, though i've installed vlc too, and xine, and totem :P
2005-04-24T08:42:00.000Z	LISP		thore: do you have gmplayer? or mplayer?

2005-04-24T08:46:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	Gentoo, Debian; I've used Red Hat but it's been some time and I haven't used it much.
2005-04-24T08:46:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	my kind of man :P
2005-04-24T08:48:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	what happened with gentoo?
2005-04-24T08:48:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	I use it on my server. I tend not to use it on my laptop.
2005-04-24T08:49:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	I like it, but for my laptop I prefer that more things be done for me. I don't really have too much time to spend getting things working on the laptop since I use it all the time.
2005-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	sure, but it's excellent if you like GNOME and you want something that runs easily and smoothly
2005-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	c'mon - did you play any movies from the beginning?
2005-04-24T08:51:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	all the"illegal" codecs, like mpeg were out :(
2005-04-24T08:51:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	fair enough. although the unofficial guide got me started pretty quickly.
2005-04-24T08:51:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	yes, but without the net connection?
2005-04-24T08:52:00.000Z	LISP	chazwurth	or on dialup? wanna get 20megs or so of progs for a movie, or xmms?
2005-04-24T08:52:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	thankfully, network connectivity isn't a problem for me, but yeah, I can see where it would be a huge pain.
2005-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	the only bad thing I can say about the nvidia drivers is that I can't suspend my laptop when using them :)
2005-04-24T08:56:00.000Z	chazwurth	LISP	not that I've heard, but I'm not a gamer
