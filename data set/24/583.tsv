2011-07-04T23:29:00.000Z	japro		does anyone here have a mobile first generation core-i cpu?
2011-07-04T23:30:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	maybe its a bios setting
2011-07-04T23:31:00.000Z	japro	sudokill	well, for one thing there is not really much to "set" in the bios and it works flawlessly in windows
2011-07-04T23:32:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	what is it? that your fan is at 100% all the time or something?
2011-07-04T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	did you change laptops? or the cpu itself
2011-07-04T23:33:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	i know nothing about changing laptop cpu, maybe you didnt put it in properly or the heatsink, thermal ocmpiund or something?
2011-07-04T23:34:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	no idea
2011-07-04T23:36:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	maybe, but that kernel is old
2011-07-04T23:37:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	youd be beter off going for a newer kernel to minimise problems
2011-07-04T23:39:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	afaik the update manager does do kernels
2011-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	japro	sudokill	uhm, what should i use that option with? i now just explicitly installed the 35-25 image
2011-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	what option?
2011-07-04T23:44:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	no sorry :p
2011-07-05T00:07:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	afaik lm sensors dont work on everything
2011-07-05T00:08:00.000Z	japro	sudokill	are there any other things to try?
2011-07-05T00:08:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	not afaik, is your cpu still throttling with the new kernel?
2011-07-05T00:09:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	wait and see how it goes
2011-07-05T00:10:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	mprime
2011-07-05T00:16:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	or hotness
2011-07-05T00:38:00.000Z	japro	sudokill	seems ok, still no turbo boost though
2011-07-05T00:38:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	no idea why turbo boost isnt working
2011-07-05T00:44:00.000Z	japro	sudokill	ok apparently the freq readings in cpuinfo are not correct when it comes to turbo boost
2011-07-05T00:45:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	yea turbo only works for maxing 1 core
2011-07-05T00:45:00.000Z	sudokill	japro	i turned turbo off but only because i oc
