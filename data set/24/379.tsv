2011-11-02T19:28:00.000Z	fellayaboy		well jrib i was logged in the remote with ssh i typed the command zenity DISPLAY=0 --warning and no dialog showed on remote and gtk-warning cannot open display
2011-11-02T19:29:00.000Z	fellayaboy		DISPLAY=:0* JRIB..I put in that command
2011-11-02T19:29:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	I think the command you want is "DISPLAY=:0 --warning"
2011-11-02T19:32:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Again, variables go before commands
2011-11-02T19:33:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	DISPLAY=:0 zenity --warning --title="whatever" --text="boo!"
2011-11-02T19:34:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Pretty much the same way, "DISPLAY=:0 firefox"
2011-11-02T19:36:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	lol... Just so you know, it's basically the same for any environment variable, e.g.: "EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano sudo visudo"
2011-11-06T10:25:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	A wut?
2011-11-06T10:26:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	export foo='blah blah blah'
2012-02-12T20:03:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
2012-02-12T20:04:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Wired or wireless?
2012-02-12T20:04:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Open a terminal and type in "sudo dhclient eth0"
2012-02-12T20:04:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Should bring it up
2012-02-12T20:04:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	After that, use the apt-get command
2012-02-12T20:12:00.000Z	fellayaboy	theadmin	thanks that did it thank u so much
2012-02-12T20:13:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	dhclient is a somewhat old alternative to dhcpcd. It gets you an IP address from your DHCP servers
2012-02-12T20:14:00.000Z	fellayaboy	theadmin	thanks for telling me...so what does network manager essentially do..cuz i thought without that u couldnt get nothing
2012-02-12T20:15:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	NetworkManager establishes connections via a graphical interface and the DBus system messagebus. Quite an annoying thing to have actually.
2012-02-12T20:15:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	For me, at least.
2012-02-12T20:16:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Try wicd, it's a nice and lightweight network manager replacement
2012-02-12T20:17:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Remove networkmanager first though
2012-07-31T01:54:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	/etc/environment is the system-wide one
2012-07-31T01:54:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	For each user, you can simply define PATH in .bashrc or such.
2012-07-31T01:57:00.000Z	theadmin	fellayaboy	Run "export", it shows all the currently set envvars
