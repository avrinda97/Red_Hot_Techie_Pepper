2011-02-02T13:40:00.000Z	nV-work		This really is one terrible situation
2011-02-02T13:41:00.000Z	nV-work		can someone just explain to me in english what is happening now? Why can I not access my drive from livecd?
2011-02-02T13:41:00.000Z	nV-work		I am in that bad habits category I guess, or more inexperience
2011-02-02T13:41:00.000Z	nV-work		the way I see this is I need to get the files and shut this machine down forever
2011-02-02T13:42:00.000Z	saby	nV-work	every drive is like a partition, its like a file which needs to be loaded in a folder called mount
2011-02-02T13:43:00.000Z	saby	nV-work	yes you can do it within the live cd
2011-02-02T13:43:00.000Z	saby	nV-work	sure
