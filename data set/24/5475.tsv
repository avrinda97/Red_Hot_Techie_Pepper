2006-06-30T08:06:00.000Z	parker`		does ubuntu not come with a c++ compiler installed by default or am I just being a huge nub?
2006-06-30T08:06:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	you're not being a nub, you are being correct :(
2006-06-30T08:06:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	that honestly and seriously shocks me... why not? lol
2006-06-30T08:06:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	ubuntu is a user's OS not a developer's OS
2006-06-30T08:07:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	I use ubuntu
2006-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	and do you know no other devs?
2006-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	because I know that I use ubuntu, I don't care what others use
2006-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	which college do you attend?
2006-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	CUNY :(
2006-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	you do not like it?
2006-06-30T08:12:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	it's meh
2006-06-30T08:13:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	I learn, but they are outdated ... barely any linux/unix and no .NET and no nice web dev stuff (AJAX and stuff like that)
2006-06-30T08:13:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	I'm going to Georgia Tech in the fall, not sure what they use up there
2006-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	Stephon Marbury went there ...
2006-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	parker`	slavik	who's that? :)
2006-06-30T08:15:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	C/C++/Java are not the world
2006-06-30T08:22:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	learn to do what?
2006-06-30T08:23:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	I managed to break fedora 5 3 times by removing stuff
2006-06-30T08:23:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	you want to learn? get gentoo
2006-06-30T08:24:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	lfs/gentoo teaches a lot ... you do shoot yourself in the head later though
2006-06-30T08:27:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	I say start using ubuntu
2006-06-30T08:27:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	after you get confortable, then get something more extreme like gentoo
2006-06-30T08:27:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	whatever it is, pick one
2006-06-30T08:28:00.000Z	slavik	parker`	all linux distros are similar in that they do similar things differently
