2008-02-21T12:33:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	im in xchat, how do i change the color schemes for everything including menu and server list
2008-02-21T12:35:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i changed the foreground and background colors under the text colors section in settings -> preferences -> colors
2008-02-21T12:36:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	so did i, but only the main chat window changes color, not the side windows
2008-02-21T12:36:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i think i had to restart xchat too
2008-02-21T12:37:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	since changing the colors i ahve rebooted my machine
2008-02-21T12:38:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i have this uberscript plugin, maybe thats the difference?
2008-02-21T12:38:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	ya i only have the native software, no plugin
2008-02-21T12:39:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	i guess i was just hoping for it to work *out of the box* without configuring plugins, im lazy like that...
2008-02-21T12:40:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i have xchat on another box w/o the plugin, i'll check that really quick and see if it changes all the areas
2008-02-21T12:41:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	if it doesnt work on your other box, could you send me that plugin or tell me where to get it?
2008-02-21T12:46:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	it only changes the main... http://digdilem.org/irc/index.cgi?entry=2130779227
2008-02-21T12:47:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	that comes with a whole bunch of annoying things too, so check out all the options and disable most of it before going into channels or you might be kicked or banned
2008-02-21T12:47:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	i instaled uberscript but nothing changes with the color scheme, and i dont see extra options for it
2008-02-21T12:48:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	it has things like random away/join/part messages and other crap
2008-02-21T12:49:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	it added three menu drop downs for me "system" "uberscript" and "favorites"
2008-02-21T12:57:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i'm also running xchat on kde, i don't know if that would make a difference or not, the other box i checked has gnome

2008-02-21T13:04:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	thats what it looks like right now, with the white on the sides
2008-02-21T13:09:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i don't know why its not working
2008-02-21T13:10:00.000Z	sn00zer	Smacky	i think i found it, go to settings -> preferences -> userlist and check the second box (use the text box font and colors))
2008-02-21T13:12:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	thanks
2008-02-21T13:17:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	in preferences go to channel switcher and choose tabs, in user list section check the second box and in the text box section check the second box, and it looks like mIRC now
2008-02-21T13:17:00.000Z	Smacky	sn00zer	thanks for the help
