2008-06-17T07:13:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	one sec I'll find you the info, I got it off some site
2008-06-17T07:14:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	thx :)
2008-06-17T07:14:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	i know i had a bookmark.. can't find it :(
2008-06-17T07:27:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	were the drives you wanted to mount NTFS?
2008-06-17T07:27:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	where? didnt get the url
2008-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	I found this but it is for if you want to access an NTFS partition with NTFS-3G
2008-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	no.. i asked about the UID.. U know.. those numbers in the /etc/fstab file?
2008-06-17T07:28:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	i dunno who generates those
2008-06-17T07:35:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	you can do; ls /dev/disk/by-uuid
2008-06-17T07:35:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	 but it appears that it just lists it alphanumerically and not in the order of the devices themselves...
2008-06-17T07:37:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	found a better command
2008-06-17T07:37:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	sudo vol_id -u <partition>
2008-06-17T07:39:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	nice!
2008-06-17T07:39:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	 :)
2008-06-17T07:40:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	everything that I was reading says that the UUID is no longer needed when editing fstab, what are you using it for?
2008-06-17T07:42:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	nothing important.. just trying to keep my fstab nice hehe.ill add the UUIDs commented. thx for the help :)
2008-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	ah understandable, nice to have everything neat and tidy :)
2008-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	;)
2008-06-17T07:43:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	glad I could help, use to be really good at this been a long time since I've worked with linux though, wasn't convient for school
2008-06-17T07:44:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	luckly, that's changing Muehehe :P
2008-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	do you know how to disable that new hardy feature that automounts external partitions when U click its icon? coz they're not listed in fstab :S
2008-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	i have no idea how that works
2008-06-17T07:53:00.000Z	asmo[B]	leato	I'm unsure, I have nothing better to do so I'll poke around see what I can figure out
2008-06-17T07:54:00.000Z	leato	asmo[B]	haha, thx :) i thought about uninstalling that feature but dunno how its called
