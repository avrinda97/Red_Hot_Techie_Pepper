2005-10-21T14:57:00.000Z	BooZee		I have a prob with my LCD screen and Ubuntu: for some reason, ubuntu sets the refresh rate to 75hz, but I want it on 60 Hz. So I go and change. BUT! When I shut down or reboot my comp, it get's back to 75 Hz all over again. What can/should I do to prevent this, and to keep the 60 HZ setting ?

2005-10-21T15:06:00.000Z	nekohayo	BooZee	hmm.. try changing the setting, then LOG OUT saving the session
2005-10-21T15:06:00.000Z	BooZee	nekohayo	 I did auto save session
2005-10-21T15:06:00.000Z	BooZee		I tried logging out and in again, rebooting... nothing helps!
2005-10-21T15:07:00.000Z	nekohayo	BooZee	and editing xorg.conf ?
2005-10-21T15:08:00.000Z	nekohayo	BooZee	actually, what problem can a higher refresh rate cause you?
2005-10-21T15:08:00.000Z	BooZee		I tried it, but didn't find the place for the refresh rate
2005-10-21T15:08:00.000Z	BooZee		it's blurry and herts the eyes...
2005-10-21T15:09:00.000Z	nekohayo		I didn't think LCDs did that
2005-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	BooZee		so what can I do nekohayo and windex ?
2005-10-21T15:12:00.000Z	nekohayo	BooZee	I don't really know... I don't understand why gnome works like that, I was so pissed when I discovered that it did not consider xorg.conf at all
