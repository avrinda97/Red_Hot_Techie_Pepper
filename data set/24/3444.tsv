2010-07-27T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	put ampersands after each command, this will put the command to the background and will allow the other commands to rum
2010-07-27T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	i'd have the top command run in a different terminal or it won't work. You will background top and not see the output

2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	ext2 is better for flash drives as it makes them last longer due to no journal

2010-08-01T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	then log a bug stating that these issues are current and can be resolved by the newer version
2010-08-01T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	ubuntu is not a rolling release so packages will be out of date some
2010-08-01T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	http://theubuntunews.blogspot.com/2010/07/gparted-061-on-ubuntu-lucid.html    may help
2010-08-01T05:12:00.000Z	FabParma	ActionParsnip	I agree, but to update Gparted for me without the Ubuntu updaet support it is quite difficult
2010-08-01T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	no, its some dudes site but the deb will allow you to upgrade the version you have to a newer version, there is also the ppa
2010-08-01T05:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	its the official blogspot site.....
2010-08-01T05:16:00.000Z	FabParma	ActionParsnip	I should update from here to avoid risks http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted/gparted-0.6.1/ I always use official sites, but how to do?
2010-08-01T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	you will need to compile the sourcecode
2010-08-01T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	its not a rolling release so the package has become old, next package review the package may get upgraded, then it WIL be in the repos
2010-08-01T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	its very simple
2010-08-10T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	can even use both for super security
2010-08-10T22:33:00.000Z	FabParma	ActionParsnip	 danub:   hiku:  thanks a lot. i dont knew that with the ssh key it can skip the normal login
2010-08-10T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FabParma	your session will authenticate using the key. You will connect straight away. If you disable password logins, any attempt will be immediately dropped as the client doesn't have the key
