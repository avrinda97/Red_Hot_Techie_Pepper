2007-01-18T10:39:00.000Z	themightyshawn		I'm trying to enable ports 6500-6600 in ubuntu server, how do I go about this?
2007-01-18T10:40:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	you have services running on those ports?
2007-01-18T10:41:00.000Z	themightyshawn		one of them in there...can't remember which one.
2007-01-18T10:41:00.000Z	themightyshawn		just gonna open a range for now until I track down which port
2007-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	themightyshawn	bulmer	might as well open all of them actually, this server is behind another firewall
2007-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	use netstat
2007-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	what are you trying to accomplish?
2007-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	themightyshawn	bulmer	I'm trying to get mythtv-backend to run
2007-01-18T10:43:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	which machine is running which? and which one has the firewall?
2007-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	themightyshawn		it's running on my ubuntu 6.10 server edition box -- well trying to run -- and my linksys router has its firewall up
2007-01-18T10:45:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	can you elaborate as to what you have in your network? hard to assist when am guessing what you got
2007-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	themightyshawn		I have a total of 6 computers in a star configuration around a linksys router. the computer I'm having issues with I just installed Ubuntu Server on and am trying to get mythtv-backend service to run. it runs as my user, as root, and when I do sudo -u mythtv mythbackend it runs, but when I run the script in init.d it gives me an authentication failed error. Ive tried anything I could think of, then I remembered on the ubuntu pag
2007-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	themightyshawn		e it said that ubuntu server has all ports diabled by default, so I thought ah-ha! that might be it...I just don't know what else to look for
2007-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	themightyshawn		I installed ubuntu server so this computer wouldn't be bogged down with a gui
2007-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	you can isolate your server and just focused on getting connected to it from a client.
2007-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	you have switches or hubs between your router and the client pc's?
2007-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	themightyshawn		switch
2007-01-18T10:51:00.000Z	themightyshawn		but I can't even get the service started, let alone think about connecting client pcs to it
2007-01-18T10:51:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	are you logged on to your server?
2007-01-18T10:51:00.000Z	themightyshawn		I'm chatting with you on it.
2007-01-18T10:52:00.000Z	bulmer	themightyshawn	try netstat -rn and it should show the ports you are using on your server
2007-01-18T10:53:00.000Z	bulmer		netstat only not netstat -rn
2007-01-18T10:53:00.000Z	themightyshawn	bulmer	it shows me my ip routing table
2007-01-18T10:54:00.000Z	themightyshawn	bulmer	I'm just going to restore to my previous distro until a later time when I can get things figured out better
