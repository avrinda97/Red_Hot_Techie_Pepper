2005-04-29T13:47:00.000Z	zao_		does anyone here use hdparm? what is the ubuntu way to save the setting? on debian i would just run a script on startup
2005-04-29T13:47:00.000Z	zao_		but i guess that is even incorrect on debian
2005-04-29T13:47:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	the only drive that you can hdparm at boot is /dev/hda the other drivers aren't loaded till after the script runs so for the cdrom devices, you have to run a script at startup
2005-04-29T13:48:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	every time I boot I run sudo hdparm -d1u1c1X69 /dev/hda; sudo hdparm -d1u1c1X66 /dev/hdd
2005-04-29T13:49:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	thx, i wonder why that isnt standardized ..
2005-04-29T13:49:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	I would do it for /dev/hdc but the cd drive is blacklisted for some seemingly unknown reason -- no one has been able to tell me why
2005-04-29T13:51:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	you dont use -c3?
2005-04-29T13:51:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	c3??
2005-04-29T13:51:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	I thought it was on or off... what's the difference?
2005-04-29T13:52:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	 i dont know what it means excactly, but 32bit sound good to me :)
2005-04-29T13:54:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	I wonder if my burner supports that LOL
2005-04-29T13:55:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	and d1 works w/o problem? i get  HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted. but i remember getting in on debian also ..
2005-04-29T13:55:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	using sudo?
2005-04-29T13:56:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	what chipset?
2005-04-29T13:56:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	nforce3
2005-04-29T13:57:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	try adding idebus=66 to the "kopt=" line of /boot/grub/menu.lst then run sudo update-grub -- reboot
2005-04-29T13:58:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	can you give some insight in what that does?
2005-04-29T13:59:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	b/c all that DMA stuff i dont really get. issuing hdparm -i /dev/hda for example show me that it is using udma5
2005-04-29T13:59:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	X66 = UDMA2
2005-04-29T14:00:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	ok, so for some reason my hd is already configured optimal?
2005-04-29T14:01:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	b/c at the same time hdparm /dev/hda (w/o -i) says: using_dma: off
2005-04-29T14:02:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	sounds to me like the kernel isn't working with your hardware -- search google for stuff relating to using the nforce3 chipset and linux
2005-04-29T14:03:00.000Z	zao_	drspin	just to get this straight, could you post your output of hdparm and hparm -i, so i know how it _should_ look
2005-04-29T14:04:00.000Z	drspin	zao_	can't remember and can't test right now -- ripping & encoding some cds :)
