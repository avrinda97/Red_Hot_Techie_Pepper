2007-03-24T12:24:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		Hey guys, I've got some issues here. I have tried about 10 times now to install Ubuntu from a CD I got a long time ago, however.. it never seems to work.
2007-03-24T12:24:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		It says, KERNEL PANIC - Cannot sync vfs with partition to unknown block (0,0) or something like that
2007-03-24T12:25:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		And this it AFTER it says it was a successful install
2007-03-24T12:25:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		Yet, it doesn't work
2007-03-24T12:25:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		Does anyone have a clue?
2007-03-24T12:27:00.000Z	eVILPeeR		I need some help installing Ubuntu onto my laptop, can anyone assist me?

2007-03-24T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	whats the problem
2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- it gives me a kernel panic and just restarts
2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	define "never boots"
2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	kernel panics are normally hardware incompatabilities (mostly)
2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- basically it says "Cannot synchronize vfs with partition at unknown block (0,0) or something to that effect
2007-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	ahhh that could be your grub config messed up
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- Hm okay. Well I don't know how to partition the drives anymore either
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- So what would I do during installation then?
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	if its not working at install time, you need to boot from the livecd and modify grubs "menu.lst" file  manually on your installed system
2007-03-24T12:31:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- Hmm okay.
2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- So I shall do that then.. and then I will be back.
2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- how should I modify it?
2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	mount your parttion and edit it with a text editor
2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- Right, I remember what that file does.. okay, well can you assist me further once I'm back? :)
2007-03-24T12:33:00.000Z	ikonia	eVILPeeR	if you have specific questions yes
2007-03-24T12:33:00.000Z	eVILPeeR	ikonia	- Okay, no worries. :) Be back in a bit.
