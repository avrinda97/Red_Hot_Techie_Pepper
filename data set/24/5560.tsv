2009-09-18T03:49:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	didn't No-Neck mention Ubuntu Server?
2009-09-24T04:02:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	gnome-open URL works
2009-09-24T04:03:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	thanks. What if I don't have a URL and only want to launch the browser, with possibly the default home page?
2009-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	does www-browser do what you want?
2009-09-24T04:04:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	also, gnome-www-browser seems to exist on my ubuntu install (wasn't in my current system) :)
2009-09-24T04:07:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	www-browser seemed to launch w3m; x-www-browser worked.
2009-10-13T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	karmic isn't released yet.  Discussion happens in #ubuntu+1
2009-10-13T03:21:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	erUSUL: thanks, but no one in #ubuntu+1 has the answer.
2009-10-13T03:21:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	ok, but that doesn't  mean it's ok to ask here :)
2009-12-05T04:34:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	check http://bugs.ubuntu.com to see if it's a known issue
2009-12-05T04:34:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	ok?
2009-12-05T04:34:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	wasn't that your question?
2009-12-05T04:35:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	that wasn't the answer I was expecting. I've been searching through bugs for a while, and I know I need to do that.
2009-12-05T04:36:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	your question sounded like you wanted to know if it was known/common.  You check the bug tracker for that.  Seeing if the 10 people checking questions in this channel know about the problem isn't going to be as informative as seeing if a bug exists if all you care about is whether it is a known/common issue
2009-12-05T04:37:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	I'm not telling you not to ask here, just where to look for existing bugs
2009-12-05T04:38:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	ok cool.
2009-12-19T09:00:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	Dorkins is trolling and could you some of your attention.
2009-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	dragon	jrib	I hope you're watching Dorkins
2010-09-17T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	dragon	right now, you're the only one not discussing support...
