2006-10-11T11:56:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	can you help me pls
2006-10-11T11:57:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	can you repeat the problem please?
2006-10-11T11:57:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	can i move my other partition to another location?
2006-10-11T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	"to another location"?
2006-10-11T11:58:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	because, i can't access that partition and its in the /tmp directory
2006-10-11T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	"sudo umount /tmp/whereverthepartitionis", and then mount it somewhere else
2006-10-11T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	and don't mount things under /tmp. *never*. they get deleted at reboot
2006-10-11T11:59:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	uh... is that ~/temp, or /tmp? they're two quite different things
2006-10-11T12:00:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	then why did you write "~/temp/disk-conf-hda6"?  try "sudo umount /tmp/disk-conf-hda6" perhaps
2006-10-11T12:01:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	/tmp, "/tmp", it's got a slash -- *not* "tmp"
2006-10-11T12:02:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	/tmp right?
2006-10-11T12:03:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	yes. please, can you just type what i told you to type?    sudo umount /tmp/disk-conf-hda6
2006-10-11T12:04:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	umount: /tmp/disk-conf-hda6: not found
2006-10-11T12:05:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	well, then i don't know where that partition is mounted. you need to find out. type "mount" and paste the line that's relevant to that partition
2006-10-11T12:05:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	/dev/hda6 on /tmp/disks-conf-hda6 type ntfs (rw)
2006-10-11T12:06:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	then type   sudo umount /tmp/disks-conf-hda6
2006-10-11T12:08:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	to remount somewhere else,   sudo mount /dev/hda6 /somewhere/else
2006-10-11T12:09:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	ok, tnx
2006-10-11T12:09:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	also, make sure you do not have that entry in your "/etc/fstab" file. if you have it, *remove it*, because mounting anything into /tmp is, as i said, dangerous. very.
2006-10-11T12:10:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	ok copy
2006-10-11T12:17:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	im getting error "You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "data".
2006-10-11T12:17:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	/data is the location
2006-10-11T12:17:00.000Z	MaKaTiGuY	LjL	/data is the new location
2006-10-11T12:18:00.000Z	LjL	MaKaTiGuY	you either have to use the root account, or mount it with permissions allowing your user to read it. i have dinner ready, though -- ask about mounting with user permissions, or perhaps read ubotu's !mountwindows factoid, it should tell you what to do
