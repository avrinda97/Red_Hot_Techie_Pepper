2008-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	pike_	ikonia	isnt xfs pretty volatile or is that just exageration (battery backup needed)
2008-02-05T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	pike_	I disagree on that, pull the plug on it and it's a massive / full file system the percentage of corruption is higher than say ext3 - but thats just about balance
