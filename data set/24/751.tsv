2011-02-03T04:32:00.000Z	kimyong		hi guys i cannot boot 10.10 CD on my new laptop. It just drop me to GRUB.
2011-02-03T04:34:00.000Z	kimyong		is there any CD that i can boot my Sandy Bridge Laptop?
2011-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	maybe the 11.04 ones
2011-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	erUSUL		!11.04 | kimyong
2011-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	ack
2011-02-03T04:35:00.000Z	kimyong		bummer
2011-02-03T04:36:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	but it doesn't make sense. I can install it with a Debian CD but not Ubuntu?
2011-02-03T04:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	well maybe 10.10 or 10.04 installs with failsafe graphics ( vesa )
2011-02-03T04:37:00.000Z	kimyong		  erUSUL it wont even go as far as that. It just drop me to Grub shell
2011-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	then something else is going on... does it show any error message?
2011-02-03T04:38:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	nope
2011-02-03T04:39:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	boots fine one fedora and deb. i think it has to do with grub 1.9xxx
2011-02-03T04:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	well with that info is hard to know what is happening
2011-02-03T04:40:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	that's why i am here.
2011-02-03T04:40:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	I'll try booth via thumbdrive
2011-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	if it just drops to grub without any error message like " giving up  waiting for root device  " or root device foo not found or something like that ...
2011-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	npoe nothing at all
2011-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	kimyong		even that i can't find the kernel either
2011-02-03T04:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	really weird. usually there is a reason no matter how cryptic
2011-02-03T04:42:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	that's what you get for a spanking new laptop
2011-02-03T04:43:00.000Z	kimyong		so right now it is running in debian squeeze :|
2011-02-03T04:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	unfortunetly bleeding edge hardware still has issues with linux ...
2011-02-03T04:44:00.000Z	kimyong	erUSUL	hey i was a steal. 1K USD for an i7-2630QM with 8 GB of RAM
2011-02-03T04:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	kimyong	enjoy the shiny new toy ;)
