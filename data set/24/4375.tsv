2010-04-24T04:21:00.000Z	juanca		hi. Please, apparently I can't go to the domain 'grooveshark.com' (I don't know if other are blocked too)... I know It's working because I've just visit that site in my Windows partition
2010-04-24T04:23:00.000Z	juanca		How can I see if a domain is blocked, because I can not navigate in Ubuntu but I just did in Windows

2010-04-24T04:24:00.000Z	juanca	K350	what's that? I'm sorry
