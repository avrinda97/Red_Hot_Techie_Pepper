2010-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	gusty		can anyone give a few pointers on fixing wired connection problems? My wired connection dies after a few hours, I've tried restarting eth0 to no avail
2010-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	isn't you wifi card? Its Rtl for any reason ?
2010-04-06T13:39:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	well it could be my ethernet card, im using wired, how do i check? thanks
2010-04-06T13:40:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	lspci may give you some clue
2010-04-06T13:41:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	i'ved tried ifconfig eth0 down..up, and sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart which didn't do anything
2010-04-06T13:41:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	only after a reboot you connection come back?
2010-04-06T13:42:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	only after reboot
2010-04-06T13:42:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	so its almost certainly that is a driver/card problem... you could avoid rebooting unloading and reloading you wifi card module from kernel
2010-04-06T13:43:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	how do I reload my ethernet card module? thanks
2010-04-06T13:44:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	first you have to know which is you card module, pastebin you lspci output and lsmod output please
2010-04-06T13:46:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	ok just a sec, I need to restart the comp, thanks
2010-04-06T13:46:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	ok
2010-04-06T13:51:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	lspci: pastebin.com/MaLTdkGi  lsmod: pastebin.com/t11yz9Di    Thanks!
2010-04-06T13:52:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	if I'm not wrong, and someone correct me if I'm, you broadcom module is b43, so rmmod b43 && modprobe b43 could be a good try before rebooting
2010-04-06T13:54:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	great, thanks for the help. So to totally resolve this problem, I would have to find a driver patch? its odd since I'ved used the same config for about a year, and it only happened recently.
2010-04-06T13:55:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	I never trusted broadcom drivers, but to me, using ndiswrapper with the windows driver always worked better, you should give a try
2010-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	So the problem is with my wired interface, the broadcom card is for wireless, would it be a different module for my wired card? Thanks
2010-04-06T13:59:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	oh sorry, I thought the problem was with your wifi... well, you wired uses a realtek driver, which isn't so good too, but you can't use ndiswrapper for wired connection, so unloading the module and reloading it I think its you best try before trying to find a better driver
2010-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	I think your rtl driver is 8139too
2010-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	what do you mean its 8139 too? Do I reload the same b43 module? Thanks
2010-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	if the problem is with the wired connection so try unloading and reloading the module "rmmod 8139too && modprobe 8139too"
2010-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	ah ok got it!
2010-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	maginot	gusty	that is not the first time I see problem with those cards...
2010-04-06T14:05:00.000Z	gusty	maginot	yea, its a crappy card, figures
