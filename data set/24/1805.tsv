2009-08-15T14:08:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	a simple shell script, for the instalation of xnview, i can't get it working, it apears "run with wine" instead of the default command to run scripts
2009-08-15T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 run it from a terminal, or chakjge its default applicaion perhaps.
2009-08-15T14:11:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	from terminal i can't create the files, even with sudo command, and the command you passed me don't work...
2009-08-15T14:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 create what file?
2009-08-15T14:13:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	the files the script was trying to install... there is an argument to execute scripts with gedit?
2009-08-15T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 sudo sh scriptname   doesent work?
2009-08-15T14:14:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	nope, i tried it...
2009-08-15T14:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 what is the scrupt suppose dto install? where did it come from?
2009-08-15T14:16:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	it was supposed to install XnView, came from it's site (http://www.xnview.com/)
2009-08-15T14:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 i dont even see a 'script' to download  there  - i do see the tar.gz  That program seems a little out dated.
2009-08-15T14:21:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	inside the *.tar.gz is the program
2009-08-15T14:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 XnView-x86-unknown-linux2.x-static-fc4.tgz    works here when i run it after extracting the files.
2009-08-15T14:23:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	witch command do you use to run it?
2009-08-15T14:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 it it has binaries in the 'bin' dir of that archive that i ran
2009-08-15T14:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 cd whatever/bin      ./whatevercmmand
2009-08-15T14:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 that is  a rather old/outdated app it  shows its age. :)
2009-08-15T14:25:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	it's the one i found to browse for *.ico files, but it's another treat...
2009-08-15T14:30:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	well, thanks for your time, i will try to figure out some stuff
2009-08-15T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gome	 there are proberly other tools to work with .ico files.. (i dont even bother with ico's andy more) i find good png icons :)
2009-08-15T14:32:00.000Z	gome	Dr_Willis	i recently came from windows, so i still have some *.ico files from my deskmodes XD
