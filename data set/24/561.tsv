2011-06-13T23:06:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		heh.. figured it was flash (mainly youtube) that was causing my system lockups
2011-06-13T23:07:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		youtube can go suck a pigstick
2011-06-13T23:07:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		nau i use flashvideoreplacer fwd to wmp codec
2011-06-13T23:08:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	If you have flash running in 11.04, I'm curious as to what browser are you using? I can't make flash work with Firefox 4.01.
2011-06-13T23:08:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	firefox 4.01
2011-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Hm... Just won't work for me. Only way to see flash (if I need to) is using Opera.
2011-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	 Shockwave Flash 10.3 r181
2011-06-13T23:09:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Did you install from the adobe website or using one of the pacakges in Synaptic?
2011-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	lemmie check
2011-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	ok.
2011-06-13T23:10:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	10.3.181.22ubuntu0.11.04.1 (flashplugin-installer)  (through software center)
2011-06-13T23:11:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	although with firefox, you /can/ do what i ended up doing and install flashvideoreplacer (add-on) and then run through the settings till you find one that works.. (flash causes massive system lock ups on youtube)
2011-06-13T23:12:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	I don't use youtube very much.
2011-06-13T23:13:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	ok. I'll try again with flashplugin-installer. I'll shutdown FF, remove package, the re-install and see if that helps.
2011-06-13T23:26:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Nope. I go to youtube as a quick test and it always tells me I need to upgrade to flash player 10.
2011-06-13T23:29:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	When it locks up can you still Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a console window?
2011-06-13T23:33:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Are your video card drivers up to date?
2011-06-13T23:33:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	yep.. using latest from nvidia
2011-06-13T23:34:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	What desktop thing are you using Unity or gnome?
2011-06-13T23:35:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	I was going to suggest whether its something to do with Compiz. You can also start up with ubuntu-classic (no effects) and see if that makes a change.
2011-06-13T23:35:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	If its happening in Windows too that sounds like something other than an OS problem. Possibly a hardware related issue.
2011-06-13T23:37:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Could it be a heat related thing? Does the problem only happen when the machine has been running a while or can you make it lock up just after turning on the machine?
2011-06-13T23:37:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Plugh	it's not heat related, as i can run minecraft and get my temps up to 105 gpu and 85 cpu   without any errors
2011-06-13T23:38:00.000Z	Plugh	rinkukokiri	Not so much the mother board but the whole package.
