2012-02-19T18:26:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	install an older version of ubuntu or try to get it working using the nv driver
2012-02-19T18:27:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	how would I do that?
2012-02-19T18:28:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	different pins?
2012-02-19T18:30:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	its not like the usual ones..
2012-02-19T18:33:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	the nvidia-96 should support the mx400
2012-02-19T18:33:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	can I do it even on the latest Ubuntu?
2012-02-19T18:34:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	10.10 still has it, not idea about newer versions
2012-02-19T18:36:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	if the driver installation thing doesnt detect it try installing the driver manualy using apt/synaptic etc
2012-02-19T18:40:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	i think it does detect the driver the problem is the driver is latest.. my video card even in Windows has problems with latest drivers.. the video card only works with windows XP no service pack..
2012-02-19T18:40:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	I will download first 10.04 as the support is extended till next year
2012-02-19T18:41:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	what do you mean?
2012-02-19T18:42:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	I thought what you're pertaining to is when booting lol.. what is that driver thing?
2012-02-19T18:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	it probably fails to detect the card then if it doenst allow you to select a driver there
2012-02-19T18:47:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	I think so.. how would I do that? can i do that even in nomodeset option?
2012-02-19T18:47:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	 i think nomodeset option has something to do why additional driver doesn't detect my card
2012-02-19T18:50:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	- yeah I can complete that installation with that, so after then, I will install my driver using apt and change the xorg.conf? will I be able to do that in nomodeset?
2012-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	if that allows you to see something on your screen yes
2012-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	NyLes	mgolisch	yeah thats the only way I can access my desktop, I will try it thanks.. but I will use 10.04 instead :)  Thanks again..
2012-02-19T18:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	NyLes	yeah do that
