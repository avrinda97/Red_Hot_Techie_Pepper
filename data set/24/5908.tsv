2006-04-03T13:52:00.000Z	Jaga		A question: When I run synaptic the buttons/list boxes/other gui controls don't match the rest of the system. Have I screwed that up somehow or does synaptic usually do its own thing?
2006-04-03T13:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	there is a fix for that if you wanna give me a second.....
2006-04-03T13:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	that's normal because Synaptic runs as root, and you run mostly everything else as "user"
2006-04-03T13:53:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	ahah yes. that explains it
2006-04-03T13:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	...still looking, I stumbled accross it the last time I did it...
2006-04-03T13:55:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	no problem.. I know the feeling
2006-04-03T14:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	crap it all....I need to start bookmarking more...I'll get it...:P
2006-04-03T14:02:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	I think I might have found it.... just reading now
2006-04-03T14:03:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	link please ?

2006-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	that's it, dang you :P
2006-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	ah, might I be right in saying that as long as you use a standard theme then root aps will work, but if you use a self-installed theme it doesn't...
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	that would explain why I think it was working until recently
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	:)
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	wait, i lied, that's for hoary
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	there was one for breezy and I use a customized theme and it works just fine
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	oh... we're still looking then?
2006-04-03T14:07:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	yup yup :P
2006-04-03T14:13:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	i just tried the hoary one - it works. i think it's just because the info to make the theme is only in /home/user/.themes. copy that to /usr/share/themes and it works straight away
2006-04-03T14:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	...maybe i did too, snuck past me...:P
2006-04-03T14:14:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	:)
2006-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	Jaga	tristanmike	I wouldn't have found it but for what you said.. so team effort :) And I've managed to get fonts to look ok today !!
2006-04-03T14:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	Jaga	HAHAHA!! found it....lol  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=148325&highlight=synaptic
