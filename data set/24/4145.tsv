2007-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	twisties		ok, i've got a question. Friend has installed nVidia driver but it'd giving him an error when starting gnome
2007-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	twisties		i had the same thing a while ago with generic kernel conflict or something but cant remember how i fixed it
2007-06-28T13:42:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	same here ...
2007-06-28T13:43:00.000Z	twisties	fisons	got the same problem? or also had to fix it? anyone know how to overcome it?
2007-06-28T13:43:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	dmesg says: "nvidia: module license 'NVIDIA' taints kernel."
2007-06-28T13:43:00.000Z	twisties		?
2007-06-28T13:43:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	i did the following (bit annoying, but it works)
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		created a small script called "gdm.sh", containing:
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		#!/bin/sh
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		sudo rmmod nvidia &&
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		sudo modprobe nvidia &&
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		sudo killall gdm &&
2007-06-28T13:44:00.000Z	fisons		sudo gdm
2007-06-28T13:45:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	you have to remove the nvidia-module via rmmod, reinsert it and restart gdm...
2007-06-28T13:45:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	its not a nice solution, but it works
2007-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	twisties		is it a permanent solution?
2007-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	dont hope so...
2007-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	fisons		i'm also looking for a better solution
2007-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	twisties	fisons	Is that a yes or no?
2007-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	twisties		I remember installing a different kernel or something
2007-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	for now its a yes
2007-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	twisties		i honestly dont remember
2007-06-28T13:47:00.000Z	twisties	fisons	ok is it going to screw anything else up? is it reversible? I only ask because this friend with the problem is a first time linux user
2007-06-28T13:48:00.000Z	fisons	twisties	nope, everything else is fine
