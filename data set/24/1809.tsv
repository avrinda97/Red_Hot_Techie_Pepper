2009-08-12T16:29:00.000Z	hvnqke_work		has there been an update to the ethernet driver modules during the last three weeks that can have broken my installation?
2009-08-12T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	does ifconfig show the statically defined address?
2009-08-12T16:38:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	I just dropped connection when trying to connect to the statically defined connection. when pinging google during that connection I get destination host unreachable
2009-08-12T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	can you ping 7.125.45.104
2009-08-12T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	replace 7 with 74
2009-08-12T16:40:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	no cigar
2009-08-12T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	ok are you using a router?
2009-08-12T16:41:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	as far as I've understood, the cable goes to a switch which goes to a router which then goes to the modem which then goes to our ISP
2009-08-12T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	ok, can you ping the router. if the switch has an ip , can yo uping that
2009-08-12T16:43:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	when pinging the router destination host is unreachable
2009-08-12T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	ok then you have isolated the issue some
2009-08-12T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	ok if you run: sudo lshw -C network you will see what chip your network card uses
2009-08-12T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	you can then chek for drivers etc
2009-08-12T16:45:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	the driver it uses is e1000e
2009-08-12T16:53:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	did I kill you? :O
2009-08-12T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	maybe it needs a different driver, or some options when it is porobed
2009-08-12T16:59:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	perhaps. but what?
2009-08-12T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	not sure, if you are using a lappy you may need to check around see what it takes
2009-08-12T17:00:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	it's a thinkpad. but I'm using it as a desktop.
2009-08-12T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	still a thinkpad, what model?
2009-08-12T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_9.04_%28Jaunty_Jackalope%29_on_a_ThinkPad_T61
2009-08-12T17:05:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	nothing about ethernet issues
2009-08-12T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	hvnqke_work	i think if you install those acpi modules it'll be ok
2009-08-12T17:05:00.000Z	hvnqke_work	ActionParsnip1	the weird thing is that this install has lasted for months without problems
