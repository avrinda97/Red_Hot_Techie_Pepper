2006-06-03T13:26:00.000Z	majd		hey, how come audio doesn't play on youtube/flast mp3 players and what not in firefox?
2006-06-03T13:27:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	you probably have a setting pointing to the wrong audio driver
2006-06-03T13:27:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	i couldn't find the settings of the flash plugin anywhere
2006-06-03T13:27:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	there is some special website url you put in to see settings...let me check for you
2006-06-03T13:28:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	type "about:config" in the url bar
2006-06-03T13:28:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	k
2006-06-03T13:30:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	i think the problem is I can't change the default sound driver
2006-06-03T13:31:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	in firefox settings or globally to ubuntu?
2006-06-03T13:31:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	globally
2006-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	alsa
2006-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	alright, open up alsa-mixer
2006-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	my bad: alsamixer
2006-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	sorry,ok that menas it should be set up correct, are any of the bars muted? or lower than full?
2006-06-03T13:35:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	what do you see if you double click the little speaker in the top left if ubuntu desktop
2006-06-03T13:35:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	volume control....
2006-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	under file menu, which device is selected?
2006-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	go for it, im crossing the fingers
2006-06-03T13:37:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	when i got my sound working it was really finicky, i feel like playing with alsa-mixer fixed it magically
2006-06-03T13:37:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	therefore its flash settings
2006-06-03T13:38:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	let me see if i can find settings here
2006-06-03T13:39:00.000Z	majd	jsestri2	i can right click on the movie and click settings but it doesn't give me an option to select the sound card
2006-06-03T13:40:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	i'm trying to find a setting for it else where, setting that way probably wouldnt be permanent
2006-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	sorry dood i'm coming up with nothing here
2006-06-03T13:47:00.000Z	jsestri2	majd	you still there?
