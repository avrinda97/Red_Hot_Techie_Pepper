2006-08-20T08:21:00.000Z	saiko		so to format an ntfs drive i figured i need to use gparted, but when i try to do so, there's an error claiming that that's an read-only filesystem
2006-08-20T08:21:00.000Z	saiko		any help ?
2006-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	you don't create the ntfs file system from linux
2006-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	i need to format it
2006-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	yes, you do that from windows
2006-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	there is no windows option for me now
2006-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	then why do you want an ntfs file system?
2006-08-20T08:23:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	hard to explain at the moment but would be nice if i could just format it
2006-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	is there any way to format ntfs hdd under ubuntu/linux ?
2006-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	I don't know of any way to do that short of loading up windows.  since ntfs would be read only in linux, I can't imagine any reason to create an ntfs file system in linux.
2006-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	but, regardless of whether there is a reason, as far as I know there is no way to do it.
2006-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	so there is no way to format an ntfs filesystem under linux ?
2006-08-20T08:24:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	i don't need to create one
2006-08-20T08:25:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	just format it and for now that's the only reason ..
2006-08-20T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	you are getting confused.  creating an ntfs partition, actually, you could do.  formatting it is windows bizarre terminology
2006-08-20T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	in unix, you create a file system with mkfs.  windows incorrectly calls this "formatting"
2006-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	now, you can create a partition, but you can't create an ntfs file system on that partition
2006-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	so i should use mkfs and try to create, say fat32 ?
2006-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	will it work ?
2006-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	you can do mkfs.vfat, yes
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	I don't recommend that either, but as far as I know, it does work.
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	ok, thank you for now
2006-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	saiko	sethk	will try to make something work, sigh, thanks again for your help
2006-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	saiko	I think the odds are good that mkfs.vfat will work for you.
