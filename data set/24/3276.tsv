2008-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	adriaan		does anyone have experience installing pine on ubuntu x86_64?
2008-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	I DO!...
2008-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	couldn't get flash to work and not many third party packages are available... and personally NO WAY I feel a difference compared to i386
2008-05-02T02:39:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	ah, that's nice to hear. Care to share with me how I can do it?
2008-05-02T02:40:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	the flash player thing can be a real pain
2008-05-02T02:40:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	thanks for the info, but I was referring to installing the program pine on a 64 bit system :)
2008-05-02T02:40:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	Oh It should work man...
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	djzn		how do I set the users to login my box without a password (no need for security here)...
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	unfortunately there's only a 32 bit .deb available
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	oh that's the issue...LOL
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	and sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture does not seem to work
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	that's what I am saying...
2008-05-02T02:41:00.000Z	djzn		a couple of things will never work... at least for now...
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	djzn		do you have the 32 bit libs?
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	the 32 bit libs, do you have it?
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	adriaan		not sure
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	do you use SKYPE?
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	I'll see what errors I get
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	no :)
2008-05-02T02:42:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	they have a tutorial which they tell you to install a huge amount of 32 bit libraries..
2008-05-02T02:43:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	I believe that you can run 32bit apps after those libs are in the system
2008-05-02T02:43:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	with force-architecture
2008-05-02T02:43:00.000Z	adriaan	djzn	could you link it, please?
2008-05-02T02:44:00.000Z	djzn	adriaan	sorry i'm in a rush. look for Ubuntu Foruns Skype 64bit.... google for it
