2007-05-15T13:57:00.000Z	ace_ace		and your cd checks out (with the check that is on the boot menu of the cd)
2007-05-15T13:57:00.000Z	ace_ace		why would we still think the cd is bad ?
2007-05-15T13:57:00.000Z	ace_ace		ah
2007-05-15T13:59:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	I have a problem with the partitioner  =  doesn't work , neither does gparted - possible routes to look at?
2007-05-15T14:00:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	It is a SCSI disk, NTFS - is that why gparted / ubuntu partitioner fail?
2007-05-15T14:00:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	no idea why partititoning fails
2007-05-15T14:00:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	can be many reasons
2007-05-15T14:00:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	top 3?
2007-05-15T14:00:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	a file left at the end of the partition? SCSI not supported? ?
2007-05-15T14:01:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	scsi is of course supported since 1991 :-)
2007-05-15T14:03:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	- what can I do to troubleshoot the partitioner? I am looking for logs, the errors are very generic
2007-05-15T14:03:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	what was your problem agian ? Please describe
2007-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	did it happen during install ? of the livecd or the alternate cd ?
2007-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	the ubuntu 7.04 partitioner fails to partition, I then tried gparted. the error I pasted way back on here. cannot write the data it says.
2007-05-15T14:04:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	you might try the alternate install cd, text based but I believe a stronger partitioner.
2007-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	was your ntfs partition taking up the entire disk /
2007-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	- entire disk, yes
2007-05-15T14:05:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	so it wanted to resize the partition ? did you ask it to resize the ntfs partitiopn ?
2007-05-15T14:06:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	- yes, the installer has a straightforward slider, I set it to 90% (I believe... erm, that means keep 90% of the disk? oh dear... I think I see a flaw in my plans)
2007-05-15T14:06:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	eh ?
2007-05-15T14:07:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	there you go !
2007-05-15T14:07:00.000Z	jgoo	ace_ace	but doesn't that mean, 50% of the remaining?
2007-05-15T14:08:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	i don know, now maybe try it with other values and see if it works...
2007-05-15T14:08:00.000Z	ace_ace	jgoo	why worrying ?
