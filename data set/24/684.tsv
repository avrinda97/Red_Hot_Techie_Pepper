2011-03-24T07:28:00.000Z	lasha	nit-wit	I can boot xp because it was a default boot partition
2011-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	lasha	nit-wit	my problem was that i cant dual boot
2011-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	nit-wit	lasha	so what is the problem it is not clear
2011-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	lasha	nit-wit	basically it overided the grub2 of ubuntu
2011-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	nit-wit	lasha	you tried to reload grub2 and it didn't work?
2011-03-24T07:30:00.000Z	lasha		I didn't restart, afraid to see blank screen again
