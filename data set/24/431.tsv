2012-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	AceBlade258		the adapter isn't listed, just a loopback and my phone
2012-11-24T02:43:00.000Z	AceBlade258		I'm fairly sure it's a lack of drivers
2012-11-24T02:44:00.000Z	AceBlade258		voltages and whatnot are a pain
2012-11-24T02:45:00.000Z	AceBlade258		I'm currently using samsung and g.skill
2012-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	AceBlade258		keep in mind, Higher-speed ram tends to have slower timings. when you underclock it, the timings are still going to be slower
2012-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	AceBlade258		meaning you will have higher-latency overall on your ram, decreasing performance
2012-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	AceBlade258		however, unless you are doing things the require a lot of memory operations, the difference shouldn't be a big deal
2012-11-24T02:49:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	you should be my fortune... i log on and get some nice information like that handed to me instead of my fortune...
2012-11-24T02:49:00.000Z	AceBlade258	BoomerBile	thanks :)
2012-11-24T02:50:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	you know what fortune is right?
2012-11-24T02:55:00.000Z	AceBlade258	BoomerBile	lol, i'll take it as a compliment
2012-11-24T02:55:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	as it was intended
2012-11-24T02:56:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	nice choice in sound ;)
2012-11-24T02:58:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	run update-pciids, i think that's still the command, they recently changed it on me in gentoo. then do lspci again maybe it will show you what that is exactly, i'll start looking it up with those numbers
2012-11-24T03:00:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	looks like it uses the e1000e driver

2012-11-24T03:05:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	you need the mei driver, in kernel 3.0.0-17-generic
2012-11-24T03:05:00.000Z	AceBlade258	BoomerBile	kernel update?
2012-11-24T03:06:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	probably
2012-11-24T03:06:00.000Z	AceBlade258	BoomerBile	no, tethered on my phone
2012-11-24T03:12:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	you can install the new kernel using a package manager, or the command line, these two people just gave you the newest version numbers
2012-11-24T03:15:00.000Z	AceBlade258	BoomerBile	I have unlimited ;)
2012-11-24T03:15:00.000Z	BoomerBile	AceBlade258	nice!
