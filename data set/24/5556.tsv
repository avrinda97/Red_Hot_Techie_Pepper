2007-06-27T14:37:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
2007-06-27T14:37:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	thanks alot
2007-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	you might want to   /msg ubotu packaging  for more details
2007-06-27T14:53:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	Im getting an error that it cant find a debian directory.. is there a command to generate this?
2007-06-27T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	how did you obtain the source?
2007-06-27T14:54:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	from packages.ubuntu.com
2007-06-27T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	what are you rebuilding?
2007-06-27T14:54:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	amarok
2007-06-27T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	you know you can just do 'apt-get source amarok'?
2007-06-27T14:55:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	yes but I want to make a couple of changes to the source before I repackage it
2007-06-27T14:56:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	it seems when I run apt-get source -b amarok it generates the debian directory
2007-06-27T14:56:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	right, so once you do that you well end up with an amarok-VERSION directory, cd in there, then issue dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
2007-06-27T14:56:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	you shouldn't need the -b, that builds it
2007-06-27T14:57:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	on running the dkkg-buildpackage command Im getting: dpkg-parsechangelog: error: cannot open debian/changelog to find format: No such file or directory
2007-06-27T14:59:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	any idea what that error is? Im sure I have done everything correctly just don't know why that debian folder is missing
2007-06-27T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	brk3	did you cd inside amarok-VERSION?
2007-06-27T15:00:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	yes
2007-06-27T15:01:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	I think Ive found the problem
2007-06-27T15:23:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	when I run apt-get source amarok is there a way of making it download from the backports respitory rather than the default one?
2007-06-27T15:26:00.000Z	brk3	jrib	sorry for the bother ive got it working finally! thanks for the help
