2007-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	gavi		deathstar, thats for me?
2007-11-04T06:28:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Try right clicking on the menu bars, and then click edit menus
2007-11-04T06:31:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	removing it completely? You could go into the Synaptic Package Manager and mark it for complete removal..
2007-11-04T06:32:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager; and, if you're addressing someone, please put their name in your response/question
2007-11-04T06:33:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Glad I can be of help
2007-11-04T06:35:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	You should be able to find xchat-gnome in the repos.. Just click in the window where all the packages are, and type xchat, for example to search for it.
2007-11-04T06:35:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	You're welcome
2007-11-04T06:38:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	You've lost me there. :P I'm rather new to Ubuntu as well, and I don't know that.
2007-11-04T06:39:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	I chose Ubuntu as it is one of the more popular distrobutions, as well as it's user-friendliness
2007-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	You can set the root password.. I don't remember exactly how, you could do a quick google search and find it easily
2007-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	I haven't tried any other distro as of yet
2007-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	it's better than being insecure
2007-11-04T06:42:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	I've read up on them before I chose one. I was tired of Windows and decided to put in a dual boot.
2007-11-04T06:43:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	pretty much :P
2007-11-04T06:46:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Cyphase was referring to Windows 2.0... (i.e. the basic text prompt, no mouse support..)
2007-11-04T06:46:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	That's part of the user-friendliness I was talking about :P
2007-11-04T06:47:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	There WAS something before 3.1...
2007-11-04T06:48:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Windows had a 1.0 too.. you expect them to start at 3.1 for just some random reason? lol
2007-11-04T06:48:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Usually it does..
2007-11-04T06:49:00.000Z	eZek0	gavi	Even though Ubuntu 7.10 is called "Gutsy Gibbon", it's still 7.10.. and before that there was 7.04, etc etc
2007-11-04T06:52:00.000Z	gavi	eZek0	do u know how to check if all the latest drivers are installed?
