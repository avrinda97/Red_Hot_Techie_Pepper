2008-02-16T20:49:00.000Z	Krumar		hey, i'm trying to use a dynamic ip with a static DNS, but when ever i set it in network manager, it gets reset when i restart the firefox, does anyone know of a work around?
2008-02-16T20:50:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	that didnt seem to come in correct, you were using a dynamic ip (doled out by dhcp?) and your dns is what?
2008-02-16T20:57:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	never mind, google got me there
2008-02-16T20:52:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	i'm at college, my ip is set by the school, i want to set it up so that opendns is my primary dns, and the school's dns server is the secondary
2008-02-16T20:54:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	my /etc/resolv.conf is set to the school's dns servers, i've tried to change and save it to what i want, but when i restart the firefox, it works for one url, then defaults back to useing just the school dns\
2008-02-16T20:55:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	i've done this before on a windows box, the set up behind it works, but right nwo ubuntu won't save the settings
2008-02-16T20:55:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	its possible, because if your school blocks another dns, your client will time out and have to use the remaining name server on the list
2008-02-16T20:56:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	the school does not block the other dns, i have done this on windows boxes, ubuntu just seems to over write the file, i've tried to make it read only, that didn't work
2008-02-16T20:57:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	sorry, i've never used the paste bin, how does it work?
2008-02-16T20:58:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	look at your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-02-16T20:58:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	http://paste.ubuntu.com/4649/
2008-02-16T20:59:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	thanks, i've not found this yet
2008-02-16T20:59:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	yep
2008-02-16T21:01:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	perhaps remove the domain-name-servers from dhclient.conf, lets see if you can override
2008-02-16T21:01:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	it looks like everything in the dhcpclient.conf is commented out except request
2008-02-16T21:01:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	perhaps remove the domain-name-servers from dhclient.conf, lets see if you can override
2008-02-16T21:02:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	so just remove the entry?
2008-02-16T21:03:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	ok, i'll make a back up and try it
2008-02-16T21:03:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	good idea to backup
2008-02-16T21:06:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	you still there?
2008-02-16T21:07:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	ok good, made it back to the web, do you know if ubuntu can hold more that 2 dns servers?
2008-02-16T21:09:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	it seems to be working
2008-02-16T21:10:00.000Z	Krumar	amenado	thank you, good bye
2008-02-16T21:10:00.000Z	amenado	Krumar	you're welcome
