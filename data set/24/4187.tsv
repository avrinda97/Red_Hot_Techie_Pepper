2007-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	kde is more customizable
2007-07-11T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	there is no command that is issued it kills X
2007-07-11T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	it's hard coded into the code
2007-07-11T08:48:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	with sudo it will need human interaction though
2007-07-21T07:35:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	I believe mandriva just uses the window manager's one that they use
2007-07-31T16:44:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	umm the title should say it's name
2007-07-31T16:45:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	that is just a panel add on
2007-07-31T16:45:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	xfce kde has it not sure about gnome though
2007-07-31T16:46:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	gnome should have soemthing like that also
2007-07-31T16:47:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	right click and add applet to panel it's called network-something or other
2008-01-15T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	you have a scrollwheel?
2008-01-15T04:11:00.000Z	unagi	kitche	yes
2008-01-15T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	unagi	up and down should change workspaces on it if it's setup correctly
2008-01-15T04:12:00.000Z	unagi	kitche	up and down doesnt but i dont want up and down i want left and right or button 6 and 7
