2007-09-09T10:04:00.000Z	gh0sty2k		how do i enable ubuntus remote desktop feature via terminal.. its not located in my room anymore so can only access via ssh
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	you could install vncserver or something.
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	but if i can enable the inbuilt one remotley it would be quicker, lol
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	to enable XDMCP?  though you may have to hunt around on the forums
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	well thats what I believe the default one does is just enables vncserver.
2007-09-09T10:06:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	thats fine, how do i enable that one via ssh
2007-09-09T10:06:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	i dont have access to the box from where i am u see.. and want to use the gui
2007-09-09T10:07:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	ahh well actually the default one shares the desktop some how it doesn't enable another instance of X on a different display
2007-09-09T10:07:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	I have no idea how to do what you are asking.
2007-09-09T10:07:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	so if i locked the screen on the machine, i cant access again using the inbuilt one unless i install vncserver?
2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	The inbuilt one is quite differnt. Like I say I don't know enough about it to help.
2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	how do i install vncserver ? do u have any good guides?
2007-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	any ideas why i am unable to access shares on my unbuntu box through windows? it keeps rejecting the password?
2007-09-09T10:10:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	you need to edit your smb.conf there is a great howto on ubuntu guide site.  You can even set it so it doens't prompt for password
2007-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	one last question, is it possible for ubuntu to link to an active directory domain in windows?
2007-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	I believe so let me give you a good site hold up
2007-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	ubuntuguide.org
2007-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	that site has a lot of howto's specifically for things you are asking.
2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	just ssh in and use apt-get
2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	apt-get uninstall ?
2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	once you are logged in just sudo apt-get install <packagename>
2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	gh0sty2k	h1st0	i dont want to install, i want to un-install
2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	unisntalling programs would be sudo apt-get remove <packagename>
2007-09-09T11:33:00.000Z	h1st0	gh0sty2k	ps aux
