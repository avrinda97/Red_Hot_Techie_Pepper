2008-04-14T02:00:00.000Z	tim167		hello, i try to make a partition on a disk with gparted, but when it starts creating it the disk automatically mounts and then gparted says it cant create a partition ...what should i do ?
2008-04-14T02:01:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	does gparted allow you to umount it again?
2008-04-14T02:02:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	not really, it gives an error
2008-04-14T02:05:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	gparted can unmount it,and then shows it as if the partition is made, but i cant write anything on it and it contains a file named "lost and found", wierd...
2008-04-14T02:06:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	did you boot from the gparted cd or is that not necessary on your computer?
2008-04-14T02:07:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	its an external USB disk that i am trying to format with a ext3 partition
2008-04-14T02:07:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	 i dont know if i should boot from a gparded CD...should i ?
2008-04-14T02:08:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	ok, i see... is that really a file named "lost+found" or rather a directory?
2008-04-14T02:08:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	no, probably not in case of a usb device, unless you booted from it
2008-04-14T02:08:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	a directory,but with a red [x] icon
2008-04-14T02:09:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	what does "sudo touch $mountpoint/somename" do?
2008-04-14T02:10:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	that sounds like a permission problem, caused by improper mounting, rather than gparted's mistake :)
2008-04-14T02:11:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	the mounting is automatic
2008-04-14T02:13:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	hm... i am not sure then... maybe it is still mounted by gparted?
2008-04-14T02:15:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	no, thats not the case, i closed gparted, i see a volume in my filebrowser, but i cant write on it
2008-04-14T02:15:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	can you umount it from the filebrowser?  if not, try "sudo umount $mountpoint"... then unplug and plug the device... maybe that helps, i do not know :)
2008-04-14T02:16:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	hmm i tried but no, actually i dont need a partition to dd a disk, do i ?
2008-04-14T02:17:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	you can dd into files or raw devices... no need to create a file system
2008-04-14T02:18:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	i have a crashed disk and i want to try dd-ing it to this new one...ok i'll try it...was the command this : dd -if /dev/olddisk -of /dev/newdisk ? or do i need to add more stuff ?
2008-04-14T02:19:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	i had all that in memo's but they are on the trashed disk ... :/
2008-04-14T02:19:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	dd if=/dev/olddisk of=/dev/newdisk bs=4k (or whatever blocksize you prefer), there are also count or offset, but i guess you do notneed them
2008-04-14T02:21:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	ok, so bs=4k is good to recover data from a broken disk ?, also do you know anything about what i can do with the image afterwards ? are there tools to recover the actual files from it ?
2008-04-14T02:21:00.000Z	andi5	tim167	fortunately i have never had the pleasure to have a broken disk, so no, i am sorry
2008-04-14T02:22:00.000Z	tim167	andi5	ok no problem
