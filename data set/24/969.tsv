2010-10-24T23:57:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	what ubuntu version are you using?
2010-10-24T23:58:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	10.04
2010-10-24T23:59:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	go to applications, accesories, passwords (or something like that, i have it in spanish) and let me know when you are there
2010-10-24T23:59:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	ok there
2010-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	do a right click on default password deposit and select change password
2010-10-25T00:00:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	ok then
2010-10-25T00:01:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	keep it blank ?
2010-10-25T00:01:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	in old password enter your normal root pass, in new password leave it blank. READ CAREFULLY THE MESSAGE and continue
2010-10-25T00:01:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	if I do so then my system will be insecured
2010-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	not your system, just the passwords stored under that deposit
2010-10-25T00:02:00.000Z	sebikul		they wont be encrypted, but they would still need your login password
2010-10-25T00:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	under that deposit...there is vino.local, hotmail, Desktop Couch User Authentication, gmail, Desktop Couch User Authentication, another form of gmail
2010-10-25T00:05:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	that are passwords stored by other applications. you should only leave the password blank if you think you are still safe (a desktop pc for example)
2010-10-25T00:06:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	so it does not delete the Ubuntu login password ?
2010-10-25T00:06:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	no, that are 2 different things
2010-10-25T00:06:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	can I delete the whole deposit ?
2010-10-25T00:07:00.000Z	sebikul		you will still conserve your login password, but you wont be asked to enter it twice
2010-10-25T00:07:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	you can delete it, but the system will create it again
2010-10-25T00:08:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	can I delete the whole deposit ?
2010-10-25T00:08:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	you can delete it, but the system will create it again
2010-10-25T00:08:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	ok now...password is blank...will it remain so after restart Ubuntu ?
2010-10-25T00:09:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	yeah, thats the point of leaving it blank, to not be asked to enter the deposit's password to unlock it and be able to retrive the wifi pass
2010-10-25T00:10:00.000Z	anygivenname	sebikul	thanks...will restart to test
2010-10-25T00:10:00.000Z	sebikul	anygivenname	no problem ;)
