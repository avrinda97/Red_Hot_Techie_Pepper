2008-01-07T16:48:00.000Z	sveakex		how do i close my telnet port? (23)
2008-01-07T16:49:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	did you install a telnet server?
2008-01-07T16:49:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	no idea, i have apache on this box
2008-01-07T16:50:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	how did you ascertain it is open?
2008-01-07T16:50:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	nmaped myself
2008-01-07T16:50:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	that's no vaolid test
2008-01-07T16:51:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	what does netstat say? what process listens?
2008-01-07T16:51:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	netstat says a lot
2008-01-07T16:52:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	i think port 23 is not there
2008-01-07T16:53:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	how about checking instead of "thinking"?
2008-01-07T16:53:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	how about i checked it but not sure where to look and it looks like it is not listening.
2008-01-07T16:55:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	sudo netstat -lntp
2008-01-07T16:57:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	the number at the local adress (127.0.0.1:8118) is my port, 8118?
2008-01-07T16:57:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	it certainly isn't a telnetserver
2008-01-07T16:58:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	no i just took a random example so you could confirm me if 8118 would the port in a local adress
2008-01-07T16:58:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	yes it is
2008-01-07T16:58:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	but i did not find a 23 there, but why is it showing as open when i nmap my own ip?
2008-01-07T17:00:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	lol, so nmap -v -A my_ip is incorrect?
2008-01-07T17:00:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	don't use nmap if you don't understand how to use it
2008-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	where can i learn to use nmap?
2008-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	learn about how tcp and ip works first
2008-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	erawfish	sveakex	heck learn about linux itself first
2008-01-07T17:01:00.000Z	sveakex	erawfish	ok
