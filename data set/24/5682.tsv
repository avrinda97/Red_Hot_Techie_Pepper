2007-05-22T10:08:00.000Z	homanj		i want to create a vmware image of windows xp, is there a way besides installing windows and using vmware converter?
2007-05-22T10:10:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	you can create an image by installing XP using vmware-server
2007-05-22T10:11:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	thanks.
2007-05-22T10:12:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	yw.  btw, vmware-server is available in feisty-commercial
2007-05-22T10:12:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	ah, cool. thanks again
2007-05-22T10:12:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	 np :)
2007-05-22T10:13:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	how do i enable commercial?
2007-05-22T10:15:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	nvm, i found it.
2007-05-22T10:15:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	it might be available via Applications -> Add/Remove...
2007-05-22T10:15:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	cool, otherwise I can give you the sources.list line
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	a quick search got me the sources.lost line
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	at least i think so.
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	and you were right, server is in add/remove apps
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	great, thanks for confirming
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	np.
2007-05-22T10:16:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	now we both know
2007-05-22T10:17:00.000Z	bimberi		:)
2007-05-22T10:18:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	only problem, is that vmware player and vmware server conflict. cannot be installed at the same time.
2007-05-22T10:20:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	ah, ok :|
2007-05-22T10:21:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	though, i can create the image with server. and then use it with player. i dont necessarily need both installed at the same time.
2007-05-22T10:21:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	am i correct
2007-05-22T10:28:00.000Z	homanj		hmm, is there a reason why the hal update is being kept back?
2007-05-22T10:31:00.000Z	bimberi	homanj	sorry I stepped away for a bit,  yes - in fact you can use server as a player.  I prefer it personally.
2007-05-22T10:31:00.000Z	homanj	bimberi	ah, cool. nice
