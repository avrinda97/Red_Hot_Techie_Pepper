2007-09-04T11:08:00.000Z	Evanlec		oh
2007-09-04T11:09:00.000Z	Evanlec		wait
2007-09-04T11:09:00.000Z	Evanlec		kk
2007-09-04T11:10:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	no, you can't
2007-09-04T11:10:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	why not?
2007-10-03T11:18:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	 alias bf2='your command goes here'
2007-10-03T11:18:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	oh to make it persistent?
2007-10-03T11:18:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	yea
2007-10-03T11:19:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	what if ive never messed with .bashrc or .bash_aliases before?
2007-10-03T11:19:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	does it require some setup?
2007-10-03T11:19:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	not really. .bashrc is pre-existing, and if you open it in your favourite editor and go down, you'll see where to add it
2007-10-03T11:21:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	and if it doesnt work on the first try, type source .bashrc in a term and try again
2007-10-10T13:13:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	either is fine
2007-10-10T13:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	just out of curiosity which of those do you prefer?
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	i cant really say i have a preference. i've only used elinks since returning to linux, and my experience with any others is so far gone it can't be relevant
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	ah ok, thot there might be one a little nicer than lynx
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	esp cuz i use mutt as my primary mailreader, it pipes to lynx
2007-10-19T10:46:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	lol...
2007-10-19T10:54:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	i think that is incorrect...u must clean install for 64-bit
2007-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	think what is incorrect? o_O
2007-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	Evanlec	riotkittie	that he can upgrade from 32 to 64
2007-10-19T10:56:00.000Z	riotkittie	Evanlec	i didnt say it was correct. :P
