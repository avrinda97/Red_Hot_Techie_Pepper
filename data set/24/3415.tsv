2010-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	jetole		sudo dpkg --configure -a
2010-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	jetole		thats a whole command
2010-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	jetole		all options included
2010-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	jetole		I have had to run it from time to time for just that error
2010-10-25T20:07:00.000Z	jetole		@ stealth_
2010-10-25T20:08:00.000Z	jetole		Does anyone know how to tell FloodBot4 to ignore me since I wasn't flooding or using <enter> as a punctuation?
2010-10-25T20:08:00.000Z	jetole		meh
2010-10-25T20:09:00.000Z	rww	jetole	stop pressing enter so often â†’ FloodBot won't tell you to stop pressing enter so often :\
2010-10-25T20:10:00.000Z	jetole	rww	so FloodBot4 is broken/incomplete? Those were distinct statements I made. An IRC bot should not typically harass legitimate users.
2010-10-25T20:10:00.000Z	rww	jetole	No, FloodBot4 is working as intended.
2010-10-25T20:10:00.000Z	jetole	rww	it's intended to harass legitimate users? Touche
2010-10-25T20:10:00.000Z	rww	jetole	It's intended to poke at users that overuse the enter key, yes.
2011-01-21T05:55:00.000Z	rww	jetole	please try to be polite and professional in here :(
2011-01-21T05:55:00.000Z	jetole	rww	what did I say that was impolite?
2011-01-21T05:58:00.000Z	rww	jetole	no
2011-01-21T06:00:00.000Z	rww	jetole	sleeping furiously
2011-01-21T06:01:00.000Z	rww	jetole	try to be less funny and more helpful. the humor in telling people that they can't ask questions often fails to reach the other person when they don't speak English as their first language.
2011-01-21T06:02:00.000Z	jetole	rww	well he asked anyways?
2011-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	rww	jetole	perhaps you missed the part where he said he felt unwelcome and left :(
2011-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	jetole	rww	it doesn't but some of us do need it for example I use nvidia cards and nouveau isn't mature yet IMHO
2011-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	rww	jetole	I know. I was commenting on the concept of default xorg.conf settings :\
2011-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	jetole	rww	I see
2011-01-21T07:23:00.000Z	jetole	rww	do you have any experience with dual screens on ati? I did years ago and it was !@#$ but I haven't tried in a while and am hoping it has since improved
2011-01-21T07:23:00.000Z	rww	jetole	nope, sorry. i keep meaning to try it (my card has two outputs), but don't have anything handy to test
