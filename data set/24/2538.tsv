2010-08-21T11:28:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	you need to be identified with nickserv to get to #ubuntu itself right now
2010-08-21T11:28:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	not the first two times you tried joining, you weren't.
2010-08-21T11:29:00.000Z	needhelp1	rww	good to know, thanks for the info :)
2010-08-21T11:42:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	jen_h, [sleepy]: Can you move the offtopic discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic, please?
2010-11-04T09:32:00.000Z	needhelp1	rww	got a link for community team listing?
2010-11-04T09:33:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	apparently http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ is the place for it now
2010-11-04T09:35:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	and to try for two: sudo apt-get update, then sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-11-04T09:35:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	the first command just updates the list of available packages. the second actually does updates.
2011-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	It is, yes. The packaging for it is being worked on; I believe it'll ship in 11.04.
2011-01-16T08:48:00.000Z	needhelp1	rww	great, good news
2011-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	(that's not a guarantee, since maybe the packaging will turn out to be too hard. but they're at least trying for it.)
2011-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	needhelp1	rww	 i found the article, it references the jan 10-14th linaro and ubuntu platform sprint
2011-03-12T10:42:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	take it to #ubuntu-offtopic, please.
2011-08-07T22:55:00.000Z	rww	needhelp1	handbrake isn't packaged because some of its dependencies have legal issues
