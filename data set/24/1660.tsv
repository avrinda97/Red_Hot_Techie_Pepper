2009-11-24T23:38:00.000Z	c3l		what tools do I need to write c# / c++ code and compile it running ubuntu?
2009-11-24T23:38:00.000Z	maco	c3l	gcc for c++, for c# you'll need mono. other than that, any old text editor will work
2009-11-24T23:38:00.000Z	c3l	maco	okay, so gcc and mono is compilers too?
2009-11-24T23:39:00.000Z	maco	c3l	mono is the .NET runtime for linux. i forget the compiler's name. you can search in synaptic
2010-06-25T23:55:00.000Z	c3l	maco	who is evil enough to run non-free software?
2010-06-25T23:56:00.000Z	c3l	maco	itd  be unethical and immoral =
2010-06-25T23:57:00.000Z	maco	c3l	yet phishing sites still exist
2010-06-25T23:57:00.000Z	maco	c3l	oh you mean running proprietary software?
2010-06-25T23:57:00.000Z	maco	c3l	it could be a bash script.. not closed, can be read fine...except for the bit where most people cant read bash scripts
2010-06-25T23:58:00.000Z	c3l	maco	well the repos are being checked for malicious code
2010-06-25T23:58:00.000Z	maco	c3l	which is why i say to use them
2010-06-25T23:58:00.000Z	c3l	maco	oh :D then I guess we agree on every point
2010-06-25T23:58:00.000Z	maco	c3l	but you could find a script online or get an email that tells you to run something...and if you're gullible do it... and even if that script is human readable, it may not be readable to *you* as the user if its in a language you dont know
2010-06-26T00:03:00.000Z	c3l	maco	youre right, you must have the assumption of that the general public being more or less stupid =)
2010-06-26T00:04:00.000Z	maco	c3l	ignorant, not stupid. ignorance is curable (ie, they could /learn/ to read scripts and code)
2010-06-26T00:06:00.000Z	c3l	maco	truetrue
2010-08-06T03:27:00.000Z	c3l	maco	it seems that doesnt grab all dependencies, as I guess LinuxGuy2009 ran taht
2010-08-06T03:27:00.000Z	maco	c3l	it wont grab ones already installed. thats why i said start at a minimal install
2010-08-06T03:28:00.000Z	c3l	maco	ah, but there must be a way to do it without installing  a new system
2010-08-06T03:28:00.000Z	maco	c3l	vm?
2010-08-06T03:28:00.000Z	c3l	maco	still
2010-08-06T03:29:00.000Z	maco	c3l	there are tools to get dependency graphs. could feed one of those into aptitude's --download-only
2010-08-06T20:06:00.000Z	c3l	maco	run man xrandr
2010-08-06T20:07:00.000Z	c3l	maco	that was ment for demoneye; run man xrandr
