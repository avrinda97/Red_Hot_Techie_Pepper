2005-12-08T06:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	welcome to the club
2006-01-10T09:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	report it as a bug on http://www.launchpad.net
2006-01-13T17:02:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	if it is real c++ not something with lots of graphics - so hello world should port but windows effects you would have to run the binary on wine and hope for the best
2006-01-13T17:02:00.000Z	Stork	ompaul	i don't know any c/c++, so it would probably be difficult to make the source run from the command line
2006-01-13T17:03:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	you would take it and compile it
2006-01-13T17:03:00.000Z	Stork	ompaul	and remove the gui?
2006-01-13T17:04:00.000Z	Stork	ompaul	what do you mean by the hooks?
2006-01-13T17:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	the framework that provides the "windows gui" that the code would latch onto
2006-06-18T11:14:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	your langauge is not what we want in this channel please tone it down a little - you need to add multiverse and then you can install it from Synaptic Package Manager
2006-06-18T11:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	read this  http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=java&searchon=names&subword=1&version=dapper&release=all
2006-06-24T07:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	sha1sum hit enter - type what you want and then hit CTRL+D
2006-06-24T07:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	enjoy
2006-06-24T07:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	there may be it is called "synaptic" as far as I know, and perhaps not so obvious it is not "synaptic package manger" as for on and off I'll leave that to you to find out ;-)
2006-12-03T13:42:00.000Z	ompaul	Stork	don't say that, just say you don't know, if the word google is being used we give a full url targeted to solving the problem :)
