2008-04-01T21:23:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	yeah, I bought it back when I first went to Iraq.
2008-04-01T21:23:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	it's the older model though.
2008-04-01T21:23:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	1st or 2nd gen type.
2008-04-01T21:23:00.000Z	stond	nicodarious	what model is it
2008-04-01T21:24:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	 is there any way to tell?  by model number or something?
2008-04-01T21:25:00.000Z	stond	nicodarious	how many GIGS is it 60 or 20 or 40 or 80
2008-04-01T21:26:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	60 gig
2008-04-01T21:26:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	looking for a model number on it now.
2008-04-01T21:26:00.000Z	stond		that is the same model I have
2008-04-01T21:27:00.000Z	stond	nicodarious	would you like to install linux on your PS3
2008-04-01T21:28:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	i'm thinking about it.  It's not doing as much as I had hoped as far as gimeing for my wife.  She still likes her gamecube (blah).  so might as well put it to work.
2008-04-01T21:30:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	man, I have looked all over this thing.  all I can find is a dern serial number.
2008-04-01T21:31:00.000Z	stond		its ok I mean there is some stuff you can do and some stuff you cant do I suggest you try going to www.PSUBUNTU.com and read up on it before if you want at least that is what i did and since I do not have a PC a went ahed and did it until I get one
2008-04-01T21:31:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	 thanks for the site.  I'll check it out!
2008-04-01T21:33:00.000Z	stond	nicodarious	the number of gigs is how you tell wha model you see at first ther wher two models the 20GB and the 60GB model now there is the 80GB and the 40GB model
2008-04-01T21:34:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	ahh. I see.  so the 60 GB is the 1st gen I take it?
2008-04-01T21:35:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	btw, how powerful is the Cell porcessor, since you can only use one core for Other OSes?
2008-04-01T21:38:00.000Z	stond	nicodarious	I am not sure since I dont know that much about it I do know If I had to say its ok but not the greatest but it is better than nonthing I guess
2008-04-01T21:43:00.000Z	nicodarious	stond	cool!  well, I'll try it out after I have read and have made a decision on what I would like to install.  I have heard word that plugging in Puppy Linux USB stick or a DSL stick works, but I have been reluctant to do such a thing.
