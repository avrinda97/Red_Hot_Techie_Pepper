2009-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	PuterPutter		I am running a Broadcom wireless on the laptop. Is it characteristic for the wireless to  slow down and then drop out?
2009-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	broadcom does suck - what version are you running?
2009-08-26T05:03:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	it is 4318
2009-08-26T05:04:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	version of ubuntu
2009-08-26T05:05:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	go to system > adminsitration > hardware devices
2009-08-26T05:05:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	see if there's a closed source driver for it
2009-08-26T05:07:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	there is a B43 driver listed
2009-08-26T05:07:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	enable it, you'll need to restart after
2009-08-26T05:08:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	i have it activated
2009-08-26T05:11:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	i 'll try this driver and see what happens
2009-08-26T05:11:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	ok
2009-08-26T05:12:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	well it immediately dropped to 1 Mb/s from 54 mb/s and stalled
2009-08-26T05:15:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	that's after the reboot?
2009-08-26T05:15:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	yes
2009-08-26T05:16:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	my next suggestion is a bug report...
2009-08-26T05:16:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	yes i just lost connection
2009-08-26T05:17:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	it came back at 1 mb/s
2009-08-26T05:17:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	exact same issue with or without proprietary driver?
2009-08-26T05:18:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	 yes   how do i go back to old driver
2009-08-26T05:18:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	same way as what you already did
2009-08-26T05:21:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	now i have no connection it does not list wireless
2009-08-26T05:22:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	you should be able to go to system > administration > hardware devices and stop using the driver - then reboot
2009-08-26T05:23:00.000Z	PuterPutter	MTeck	i did that and it killed wireless all together  lol
2009-08-26T05:24:00.000Z	MTeck	PuterPutter	I'd file a bug on it - This is beyond my ability
