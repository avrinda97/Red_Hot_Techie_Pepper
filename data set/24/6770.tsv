2006-10-03T05:26:00.000Z	nocturn		I moved someone to Ubuntu, but she needs to make some changes to her website, which is written in ASP
2006-10-03T05:26:00.000Z	nocturn		Is ther a GUI toolkit that supports that (ASP)
2006-10-03T05:26:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	you mean an IDE?
2006-10-03T05:27:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	yeah.  Something like frontpage
2006-10-03T05:27:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	i dont know about asp but try nvu or quanta+
2006-10-03T05:27:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	it's just to allow yer to changes some text in it
2006-10-03T05:27:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	nvu does not recognise the ASP
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	quanta is good, but no GUI part I thought (it's been a while)
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	well, it is a gui
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	or you want a wysiwyg editor
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	yeah
2006-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	I dont know of any sorry
2006-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	i use emacs :) and so should everyone else :P
2006-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	LOL, I think she would freak at Emacs.  I'm kinda proud that the switch went so well
2006-10-03T05:30:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	 :)
2006-10-03T05:41:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	have you tried nvu?
2006-10-03T05:42:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	yeah.  it would work, but it thinks that the asp is xml
2006-10-03T05:43:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	yeah it doesnt like the %
2006-10-03T05:44:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	indeed.  I'm worried that most editors will have that problem.
2006-10-03T05:47:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	looks like your out of luck if you isist on wysiwyg editor
2006-10-03T05:47:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	best to stick to somthing like bluefish or quanta imo wysiwygs suck'
2006-10-03T05:49:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	I agree
2006-10-03T05:49:00.000Z	nocturn	variant	but the user has only basic computer skills
2006-10-03T05:54:00.000Z	variant	nocturn	its not computer skills you need.. its web development skills and imo, being able to use a wysiwyg editor does not mean you know how to develop webpages
