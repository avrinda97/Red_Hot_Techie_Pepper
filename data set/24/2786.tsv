2008-08-21T15:19:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	you maybe have a web proxy problem
2008-08-21T15:59:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	then you DO have a DNS issue
2008-08-21T15:59:00.000Z	mantise	rtu34672	i see mate.. but i have added the 2 right dns i have, and they work in windows ?
2008-08-21T16:00:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	so you are back in windows now?
2008-08-21T16:00:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	difficult to test you linux setup if you are in windows
2008-08-21T16:00:00.000Z	mantise	rtu34672	yes.. cant do anything in ubuntu, undernet i can connect to tho.. but not freenode
2008-08-21T16:01:00.000Z	mantise	rtu34672	well i could not connect to freenode to talk to u in ubuntu :/
2008-08-21T16:01:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	what is undernet?
2008-08-21T16:01:00.000Z	mantise	rtu34672	undernet irc server
2008-08-21T16:01:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	Whiz2: okay
2008-08-21T16:02:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	still it looks like a DNS issue
2008-08-21T16:04:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	DNS problem or proxy problem. do you know if there is a transparent proxy, possible filtering things?
2008-08-21T16:05:00.000Z	mantise	rtu34672	im sure there isnt mate
2008-08-21T16:08:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	if you get an IP it is more than just a modem. it is a router.
2008-08-21T16:11:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	i just tried to connect to undernet, they won't let me in
2008-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	rtu34672	mantise	i just managed to get into undernet as well, #ubuntu
