2011-01-22T17:05:00.000Z	bhavesh		SO here is my screen shot : http://i.imgur.com/sBH5Z.png -- On the right side it shows file manager. I want to merge the 2nd 4th and 5th partition which are empty
2011-01-22T17:06:00.000Z	bhavesh		with gpartition -- shows on the left
2011-01-22T17:06:00.000Z	bhavesh		how can I know which drive is known as sda2 and which one is sda7?
2011-01-22T17:07:00.000Z	bhavesh		because all are called as new volume
2011-01-22T17:08:00.000Z	bhavesh		hmm?
2011-01-22T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	by their contents? size?  UUID?  You should give them labels, then they'll get mounted with their labels
2011-01-22T17:09:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	sudo blkid
2011-04-21T21:44:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	why do you want to copy a folder there?
2011-04-21T21:44:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	its a C++ folder
2011-04-21T21:44:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	be more specific
2011-04-21T21:44:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	: its a c++ libraries folder that I want to copy to my college computer... because I cannot access internet there..
2011-04-21T21:45:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	I tried that.. but Symatic just made a 10byte text file
2011-04-21T21:45:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	yes then you run that script on a machine with internet
2011-04-21T21:46:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	I didn't assume you did
2011-04-21T21:46:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	I didn't do what?
2011-04-21T21:47:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	go to a different machine with internet and run the script you generated.  It should download the packages you need.
2011-04-21T21:48:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	man, I want to install c++ libraries on my college computer which does not have an internet access... thats it
2011-04-21T21:48:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	you're not reading what I tell you
2011-04-21T21:49:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	-__- u told me to download these packages on a different machine
2011-04-21T21:49:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	yes, do that.  That's how you solve your problem.
2011-04-21T21:51:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	I think this should work sudo cp * /home/Downloads usr/libraries
2011-04-21T21:51:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	sure, if you want a broken system
2011-04-21T21:52:00.000Z	bhavesh	jrib	will just pasting a file from my home computer to one in my college break it?
2011-04-21T21:53:00.000Z	jrib	bhavesh	I told you what you need to do.  I do not understand why you continue to want to just copy files manually and avoid the package system.
