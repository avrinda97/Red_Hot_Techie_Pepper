2009-01-19T10:44:00.000Z	kevdog		lynx is really hard to use
2009-01-19T10:45:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	what do you recommend instead?
2009-01-19T10:45:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	I wish I knew -- what do you want to do?  wget is good for downloading links directly
2009-01-19T10:47:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	alpine is a fancier version apparently.  i haven't tried it since i switched to mutt and all my pine-fu is forgotten
2009-01-19T10:49:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	alpine supports imap, so you can use it with your gmail box :]
2009-01-19T10:51:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	postfix is pretty easy but i moved my domain to google apps so i don't have to mess with that sort of thing anymore.  mail nowadays is really best done by professionals.
2009-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	I need to send mixmaster messages from my computer and relay them through google's smtp server.  I just need a relay
2009-01-19T10:52:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	postfix is pretty simple yeah, and easy to configure smarthost
2009-01-19T10:53:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	 You'd recommend postfix or something else?
2009-01-19T10:53:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	postfix is what i use by default normally, unless sendmail is required (mostly at work this happens)
2009-01-19T10:56:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	 Ive setup exim before ; Have you used this?
2009-01-19T10:56:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	a long time ago - it was debian's default when i was using debian.
2009-01-19T10:57:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	 Just wondering where to waste my time: postfix or exim
2009-01-19T10:58:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	i would learn postfix if i were you i see it more often than exim and not just on my own machines
2009-01-19T10:59:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	Cool!!  Just got to get the mixmaster component setup after that!!  Guess I should go one step at a time!!
2009-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	insofar as i can connect to the internet yes :]
2009-01-19T11:15:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	 and that command is failing?  Weird
2009-01-19T11:16:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	??
2009-01-19T11:16:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	seriously I confused
2009-01-19T11:22:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	i assume he can install ubuntu-desktop from the CD
2009-01-19T11:23:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	check your /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure the cdrom is listed as one of the repository choices
2009-01-19T11:24:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	i have my cdrom lines commented out ;]
2009-01-19T11:25:00.000Z	kevdog	wastrel	so do I, however if he is going to install ubuntu-desktop from cdrom shouldn't these lines be active only for now?
2009-01-19T11:33:00.000Z	wastrel	kevdog	fyi  /etc/lsb-release
