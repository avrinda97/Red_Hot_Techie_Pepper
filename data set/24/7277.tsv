2005-09-08T05:46:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	cause they're not very reliable?
2005-09-08T05:47:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	you realise that that was the most pointless irc session :-)
2005-09-08T05:47:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	more or less, yes :)
2005-09-22T13:04:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	hi again
2005-09-22T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	did you get sorted
2005-09-22T13:05:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	i'm afraid not
2005-09-22T13:06:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	isn't there a command i must run in order to make the script run automaticazlly?
2005-09-22T13:09:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	well that file should live in init.d and a sym link should point back to that
2005-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	currently thde script is in /etc/rc5.d ... you mean i need to create a symlink in /etc/rc.d?
2005-09-22T13:13:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	#!/bin/sh  as the first line is needed :)
2005-09-22T13:14:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	of course i'm so stupid
2005-09-22T13:14:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	but do i need a symlink as well?
2005-09-22T13:14:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	is also has to be in init.d and ln -s  real_name S99foo
2005-09-22T13:15:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	the correct place for that file is in /etc/rc2.d <<<  note the 2
2005-09-22T13:16:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	the correct place for that LINK is in /etc/rc2.d <<<  note the 2
2005-09-22T13:27:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	still doesn't work ... http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2272
2005-09-22T13:32:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	is there anything wrong with what i did ?
2005-09-22T13:36:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	did you add that line to the start of the file?
2005-09-22T13:37:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	in /etc/init.d/wifi ?
2005-09-22T13:43:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	that would be a good place for what we were trying to do
2005-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	sry, what place?
2005-09-22T13:45:00.000Z	ompaul	elvirolo	that /etc/init.d/wifi
2005-09-22T13:46:00.000Z	elvirolo	ompaul	yeah, i pasted its content in the paste bin
