2010-01-03T05:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3		can anyone please help me get this stupid tor to run?
2010-01-03T05:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3		!tor
2010-01-03T05:41:00.000Z	darthanubis	remoteCTRL3	install the tor ppa
2010-01-03T05:45:00.000Z	darthanubis	remoteCTRL3	I did not say anything about a Firefox tor button.
2010-01-03T05:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	i beg your pardon?
2010-01-03T05:45:00.000Z	darthanubis	remoteCTRL3	I did not say anything about a Firefox tor button.
2010-01-03T05:45:00.000Z	darthanubis	remoteCTRL3	install the tor ppa
2010-01-03T05:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	well first off all repeating the same thing doesnt make it any clearer, second i was talking about tor button, third what is a ppa?
2010-01-03T05:47:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	can help only midreaders huh?
2010-01-03T05:56:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	btw no such thing as a tor ppa;)
2010-01-03T05:58:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	are you on karmic? if yes i suggest you do a apt-cache search tor and then tell me which one to pick
2010-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	i would very much like to search for it, see the clue is to apt-cache search returns like 10 billion results as it also finds dozens of ediTORs etc. and just apt-get install says package does not exist but is referred to by another... so i'd be very thankful if you could share the precise package name with me... since you are using it...
2010-01-03T06:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	thanks man, lemm look into this for a minute:)
2010-01-03T06:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	hell, why does this work like charms if you install it manually and precisely not with this phunny thor button of firefox?
2010-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	well i wasnt aware that that was a crappy hack since mozilla provide it on their homepage, kinda awkward i have to say, having to tamper with a plugin that much and finally enabling the whole crap via a completely different method anyways...
2010-01-03T06:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	so how do i know now that i am actually "tor"ed?
2010-01-03T06:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	sure did
2010-01-03T06:17:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	ah view the network i guess:)
2010-01-03T06:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	thanks for your assistance dude i think i got it from here:)
2010-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	one more i got: how do i know if ff somehow bypasses this tor thing now or is basically EVERYTHING being passed through there? meaning like also irc?
2010-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	just like ordinary proxy settings?
2010-01-03T06:25:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	humm... well that would have been the advantage of thorbutton; not to have to do/undo this setting all the time, for tor for sure isnt fit for downloading purposes...
2010-01-03T06:26:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	which war basically what i was lloking for as i am using otr for pidgin and co anyways...
2010-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL3	darthanubis	ok i got it running with the phunny tor button also but maaaan is this slow :D
