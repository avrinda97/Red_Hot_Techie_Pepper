2011-10-31T17:36:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	did you say :turn off the card" ?
2011-10-31T17:37:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	just blacklist the nvidia driver and reboot
2011-10-31T17:39:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Well, compiz ain't starting for me it says it's missing GLX, I'm guessing the nvidia card is the problem, so I want to disable it, is there a better alternative?
2011-10-31T17:39:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	do you have an onboard video card too?
2011-10-31T17:39:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	I don't mind extra GPU power, but I would like to be able to turn the card off when on battery
2011-10-31T17:40:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Yeah, an intel card
2011-10-31T17:40:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Well, both are onboard, optimus switches between them
2011-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	ok; on-the-fly, it would do good to disable the nvidia when its working
2011-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	just disable the nvidia from the bios (if you can ) and boot normally
2011-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	oops it would do *no* good
2011-10-31T17:42:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	I've read that the bumblebee project does just that, but there hasn't been any activity within 13 weeks in the ppa, and I'm concerned it might be inactive
2011-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	the latest update is Sep
2011-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Oh, it would appear they've moved to: https://launchpad.net/~mj-casalogic/+archive/ironhide/+packages
2011-11-01T14:47:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	take a look at this for your solution -> http://developer.gnome.org/gio/2.28/GSettings.html
2011-11-01T14:48:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Thanks, the indicator shows now, I just had an invalid icon name, no need to whitelist
2011-11-01T14:48:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	ok
2011-11-01T14:48:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	I'm looking into the default list of icons for Ubuntu 11.10 that I can use, or how to use custom items
2011-11-08T14:40:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	mount the remote directory via sshfs?
2011-11-08T14:40:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	or download the file, edit it and then upload it back
2011-11-08T14:40:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	I see, allright. I asked because I thought there would be a faster alternative
2011-11-08T14:41:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	yes; thats a font-end for SMB/NFS/WebDAV/SSHfs etc
2011-11-08T14:42:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Is it still available in Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-08T14:43:00.000Z	phlak_user	GeorgeJ	 in Nautilus, there is an option called "Connect to Server"
2011-11-08T14:44:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	phlak_user	Found it, tyvm!
