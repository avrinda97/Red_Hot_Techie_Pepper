2007-08-14T07:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	How are you trying to run the script?
2007-08-14T07:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	./Z605
2007-08-14T07:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	np
2008-06-23T02:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	In what way? It can access far less than firefox can with a default setup
2008-06-23T02:20:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	IE is the most buggiest browser out there, would you ever call it safe?
2008-06-23T02:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	It's always a good idea to run your browser as a user which has no access to your important documents ( which are usually owned by your user and are in your home folder )
2008-06-23T02:21:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	Im talking about winbugs man
2008-06-23T02:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	I am not talking about IE, I am talking about isolation
2008-06-23T02:22:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	If you want isolation, use a VM
2008-07-14T02:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	No, AFIK you need to recompile your kernel to get Vista UDF to work :(
2008-07-14T02:08:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	that isn't really recommended, why motu's won't compile it with support?
2008-07-14T02:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Drk_Guy	Don't know
2008-07-14T02:09:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	Anyway, i'll download latest tar.bz2 from kernel.org
2008-07-14T02:14:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Jordan_U	If i compile my kernel, nvidia will still work?
