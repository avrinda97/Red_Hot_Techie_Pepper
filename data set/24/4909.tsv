2006-12-12T10:20:00.000Z	hydrox		Hello?
2006-12-12T10:20:00.000Z	hydrox		I had a question about a problem I'm having, if anyone minds helping out?
2006-12-12T10:21:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	what problem?
2006-12-12T10:22:00.000Z	hydrox	hume	When I try and boot the 2.6 kernel, it just stops, i don't know how to make it output anything with verbosity, so even that will help. 2.4 kernel boots but dosen't have support for the SATA harddrive I have. I'm using an official disk, too, and it happens with every single Linux i've tryed
2006-12-12T10:23:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	whats the exact point it stops, and do you have any error msgs?
2006-12-12T10:23:00.000Z	hydrox		it decompresses fine, and when it says "booting kernel..." it just freezes, no messages
2006-12-12T10:23:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	is there any data in /var/log/syslog that tells about it, that is, where it stops booting the 2.6 kernel?
2006-12-12T10:24:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	ubuntu regular kernel? right architecture?
2006-12-12T10:24:00.000Z	hydrox	hume	It's booting off the CD, so i can't check any logs
2006-12-12T10:24:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	are you sure the CD is OK? Tried booting it on another machine?
2006-12-12T10:24:00.000Z	hydrox		Yeah, right architecture, i tryed both x86 and the 64bit one [my CPU supports both..well, it's ment to :P] , I've been using Linux for 3years, it's just a new computer, and a big problem with not much information :P
2006-12-12T10:25:00.000Z	hydrox		yeah, the CD is okay
2006-12-12T10:25:00.000Z	hydrox		I have about 7 Ubuntu ones, it has the same problem with my Debian ones too
2006-12-12T10:25:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	you mean that the same thing happens with the computer if you boot off a debian CD with 2.6 kernel?
2006-12-12T10:26:00.000Z	hydrox		Yeah, sorrie. Cold hands so my typing is screwy and i'm not explaining well
2006-12-12T10:27:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	in that case there must be something with this particular kernel version and your computer, strange. can you try with other 2.6 kernels and see if they boot?
2006-12-12T10:28:00.000Z	hydrox		I don't really want to deviate from Debian/Ubuntu kernels. It's older versions of the kernel have trouble too. Old debian, latest debian, x86, 64bit, old ubuntu, new ubuntu, all the same problem, all diffurent versions of the 2.6 kernel
2006-12-12T10:29:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	got to go have dinner, but I'm afraid I dont know about that. I'd try to install with 2.4-kernel and then install a  number of 2.6-kernels and check the logs
2006-12-12T10:30:00.000Z	hydrox	hume	I guess, but SATA harddrive, so I can't. Thank anyway :)
2006-12-12T10:30:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	what do you mean you cant? no support for sata in 2.4?
2006-12-12T10:30:00.000Z	hydrox	hume	Yeah, as far as I know, and I can't really change the 2.4 kernel if there is
2006-12-12T10:31:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	try asking in debian channel as well - must be someone else having that problem
2006-12-12T10:31:00.000Z	hume	hydrox	good luck..:)
2006-12-12T10:31:00.000Z	hydrox	hume	Thanks bro :)
