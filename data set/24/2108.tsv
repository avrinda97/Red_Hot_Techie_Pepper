2011-01-12T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 locate updates the locate database about once a day. as a cron job.
2011-01-12T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 thats why its so fast at finding things.. but not always up to date
2011-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 wine shows them as instaslled where exactly?
2011-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 how is wine showing that.
2011-01-30T15:27:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	from the start menu wine>programs and list me some programs installed
2011-01-30T15:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 thats not 'wine' showing anything.   when a wine app installs.. the process gernates a .destktop and other files that gnome menus use. :)
2011-01-30T15:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 i think they are stored in ~/.config/menus/applications-merged
2011-01-30T15:29:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	but i start wine>Uninstall wine software it shows me tthat programs
2011-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	and list them in the add/remove programs window
2011-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	  I tend to just purge my whole .wine dir every so often. :) i rarely fight with wine much.
2011-01-30T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 i rarely even mess with th extra things in the wine 'menu' either.
2011-05-01T14:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 select the classic desktop at the GDM login screen if you want the old 'classic' gnome desktop.
2011-05-01T14:06:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	how is called this thing to see options for it
2011-05-01T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 when you log out.  you enter your user name. then theres a menu at the bottom. select 'classic'
2011-05-01T14:06:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	i was asking for the horizontal thing
2011-05-01T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 and its not clear what you are asking about. You mean the top panel thats always been in gnome? or the left side panel - thats the new unity launcher thing..
2011-05-01T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 you really dont tweak unity much at this time.
2011-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	unity launcher thing thanks
2011-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	ajah	Dr_Willis	i want to access tree structure of programs like before system->preferences ... how to do this in 11
2011-05-01T14:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ajah	 not sure what you mean. You want the preferances tool? its under a menu item under the power button now.
