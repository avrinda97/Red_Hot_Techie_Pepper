2011-07-09T03:05:00.000Z	Phoenixz		Any idea why apt-get install flash would fail on 11.04?

2011-07-09T03:05:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	how does it fail?
2011-07-09T03:06:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	http://pastebin.com/BHmBrah0
2011-07-09T03:07:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	tried flashplugin64-installer yet?  that spares you of the nspluginwrapper woes
2011-07-09T03:07:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	not yet, didnt know there was one, will try now
2011-07-09T03:07:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	you might want to remove flashplugin-installer (the 32bit version) beforehand
2011-07-09T03:08:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	mmm, I dont have a flashplayer64-installer package..
2011-07-09T03:09:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	clean your glasses please ;)
2011-07-09T03:09:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	regarding your paste, see line 5
2011-07-09T03:10:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	usr13: Just saw it.. Okay, but what about the crash? I cant imagine its "okay" like this..
2011-07-09T03:11:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	the crash smells terribly like nspluginwrapper
2011-07-09T03:11:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	I have the 64 bits install of kubuntu, but I cant find a flashplugin64-installer
2011-07-09T03:11:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	what version?
2011-07-09T03:11:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	Indeed it does.. since you say the 64 bit doesnt have this problem, I'd install it, but its not there
2011-07-09T03:11:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	version of ubuntu? 11.04
2011-07-09T03:12:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	there you go
2011-07-09T03:12:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	hmmm...  seems to be a PPA indeed, I'll look in my sources..
2011-07-09T03:14:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	https://launchpad.net/~sevenmachines/+archive/flash
2011-07-09T03:16:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	itaylor57: Thanks, I'll try the 64 bits version!
2011-07-09T03:16:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	see my URL, it has a one-line command to do that
2011-07-09T03:17:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	erm, no, it hasn't the full command, so -> 'sudo apt-add-repository ppa:sevenmachines/flash'
2011-07-09T03:18:00.000Z	szal	Phoenixz	then 'sudo apt-get update' and install flashplugin64-installer
2011-07-09T03:18:00.000Z	Phoenixz	szal	yeah, already added the repo
