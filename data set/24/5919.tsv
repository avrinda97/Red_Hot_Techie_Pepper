2006-03-24T09:42:00.000Z	Minion01		how come i can't play any of the music off my ipod?
2006-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	Minion01		it tells me that there were no decoders found to handle the stream
2006-03-24T09:43:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	I think it's in AAC format or something, and isn't it encrypted?
2006-03-24T09:44:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	nope, i can play a few of the files, but only a few. is there a way to get the right codecs to play them all?
2006-03-24T09:44:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	did these tunes come from itunes?
2006-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	yes
2006-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	on my windows computer
2006-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	http://www.apple.com/ipod/specs.html
2006-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	if you go down to "audio support" you'll see the range of audio formats supported by the ipod
2006-03-24T09:45:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	I believe music from itunes is in the "protected aac" format and is encrypted
2006-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	my ipod plays, but i want to hook my ipod up to my computer and play the music off of it
2006-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	which might prevent you from listening to it outside of itunes, unless you crack the encryption
2006-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	they arn't from the itunes music store
2006-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	just songs i put on there, mp3 files
2006-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	okay, so what were you using to play?
2006-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	what program?
2006-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	i tried that totem thing and rythmbox, they both wont play
2006-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	do they mention which codec they are missing?
2006-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	no
2006-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	if they are really mp3s I think they should just work
2006-03-24T09:48:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	well, they dont
2006-03-24T09:48:00.000Z	Dewi	Minion01	are you sure they aren't AAC files?
2006-03-24T09:48:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	rythmbox gives me the error "this is not an audio stream"
2006-03-24T09:48:00.000Z	Minion01	Dewi	yes, i'm sure
