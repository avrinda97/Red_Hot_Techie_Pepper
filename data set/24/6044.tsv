2010-08-04T20:17:00.000Z	cablop		how can i install the video driver from the shell?
2010-08-04T20:18:00.000Z	cablop		i can't start the X server, can anybody help me?
2010-08-04T20:19:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	what error do you get when you try to start it?
2010-08-04T20:20:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	segmentation fault
2010-08-04T20:20:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	was it working at one time? or is this a new install?
2010-08-04T20:21:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	it was working, i just changed it to a different board, it started in low graphics mode, then it offered me the video driver, i installed, then reloaded and it's not working anymore
2010-08-29T23:12:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	I tried it...ran terribly slow
2011-03-10T15:59:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	are the menus and such in spanish or the software descriptions? It might be the repos you are using are supplying info in spanish
2011-03-10T16:00:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	mmm interestng, let me check it
2011-03-10T16:00:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	nope, sources are appointing to Main Server
2011-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	what part of software center is in spanish? The menus at the top of the window? Or just the description and such?
2011-03-10T16:07:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	yes, the descriptions, the menus are ok...  by now
2011-03-10T16:08:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	the descriptions are not translated by the system. LANG would set the menus and such...that is why if you install the spanish language pack the menus in firefox change. The software descriptions are, if I remember correctly, downloaded from the repos
2011-03-10T16:09:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	i think you are right, but i'm using the main server, not any latinamerican or spanish one
2011-03-10T16:11:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	yes, but I think you are spinning your wheels looking at LANG and such. I think you should look at why you got the wrong info from the repos
2011-03-10T16:12:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	right... maybe they're sending me info based on my time zone or counry?
2011-03-10T16:12:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	sweden, right?
2011-03-10T16:12:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	nope, colombian
2011-03-10T16:13:00.000Z	th0r	cablop	then yes, might be country based....but check the link erSUL just sent
2011-03-10T16:25:00.000Z	cablop	th0r	and erusul, thanks, software list was rebuilt and it is in the correct language now :)
