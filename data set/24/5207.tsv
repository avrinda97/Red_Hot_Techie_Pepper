2012-10-16T13:03:00.000Z	Josh		If I have C D E and system reserve as Primary partitions, so I cannot create another partition, not even extended
2012-10-16T13:03:00.000Z	Josh		Therefore, I'll have to format one of my existing partitions.
2012-10-16T13:03:00.000Z	Josh		But someone told me that, I can't only format say, D and make it extended
2012-10-16T13:03:00.000Z	Josh		So, I wanted to ask, I can or I cannot?
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	Josh		The person told me, if I want to format the partition, I'll have to format both D and E partitions.
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	wols_	Josh	you can move the last partition to an extended partition even, without needing to format anything.
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	Josh		I can?
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	Josh		How?
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	wols_		gparted
2012-10-16T13:04:00.000Z	Josh	wols_	For that I need an extended partition
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	Josh		I don't have extended partition.
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	Josh		Thats the main problem
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	wols_	Josh	you CREATE one
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	wols_		and yes you can do it
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	Josh	wols_	I cannot, as I already have 4 primary partitions.
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	wols_		you can if you use gparted to do it
2012-10-16T13:05:00.000Z	Josh		I do have gparted.
2012-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Josh		and gparted is telling me, I already have 4 primary partitions.
2012-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Josh		System Reserved, C D and E
2012-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Josh	wols_	can you convert primary partition to Extended?
2012-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Josh		Nope, unless you format.
2012-10-16T13:06:00.000Z	Josh		But the question is, Is it have to be the last partition, that is E
2012-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	Josh		or I can just format D and format it newly as extended.
2012-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	wols_	Josh	wrong. but since you obviously are hopeless, I stop here. have a nice day formatting
