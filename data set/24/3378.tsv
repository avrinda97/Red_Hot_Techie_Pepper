2008-05-17T01:58:00.000Z	amenado		tim167-> not two devices, perhaps two partitions?
2008-05-17T01:59:00.000Z	amenado		ldiamond-> look at your configure file and see if mkinitramfs is compiled as a module
2008-05-17T02:00:00.000Z	amenado		tim167-> one single usb pendrive shows as two? ..now way..
2008-05-17T02:02:00.000Z	amenado		tim167-> id unmount it and remount it and see if it really detects two...confirm  with  cat /proc/partitions
2008-05-17T02:04:00.000Z	amenado		tim167-> well it does show you have only  /dev/sdb  so where is the two usb drive you speak of?
2008-05-17T02:05:00.000Z	amenado		Mudassar-> most likely the firewall dis-allows you
2008-05-17T02:06:00.000Z	amenado		Mudassar-> perhaps i did not understand you, from where are you doing the pinging?

2008-05-17T02:07:00.000Z	amenado		Mudassar-> i want to make sure I folllow you, from your client (another host) you are trying to ping a server?
