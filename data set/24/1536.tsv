2009-11-30T00:10:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	btw ctrl shift dragging a file/folder in nautilus will also create a symlink
2009-11-30T00:12:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	you also want to be careful about symlinking a child folder of a protected parent folder...i don't think it inherits its permissions
2009-11-30T00:19:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	No, my Ext Hard Disk has got permissions...
2009-11-30T00:21:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	yes, so parentFolder ( not publicly viewable) -> childFolder... (assumed to be private due to parent folder)
2009-11-30T00:25:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	so, you mean i need to symlink entire external hard disk (My Passport dir)  available to my LAN friends? I want to share on FTP just Movies (/media/My Passport/Movies) and want it to be pointed by movies as in /srv/ftp/movies
2009-11-30T00:26:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	no what I am saying is that don't expect childFolder to be hidden to other users if you symlink it to a publicly available place on the main drive
2009-11-30T00:26:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	that is if you have parentFolder setup to be hidden or non-accessable due to permissions
2009-11-30T00:27:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	oh..i had gotten it all wrong then :-) .. no issues.. i want "movies" and inside to be fully visible
2009-11-30T00:27:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	this is what i meant by symlinked folders do not inherit their source parent folder permissions....
2009-11-30T00:28:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	infact i don't think folders inherit their parent folders permissions anyway
2009-11-30T00:29:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	yeah
2009-11-30T00:29:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	ran this "sudo ln -s Movies /srv/ftp/kaleidoscope" it didn't work..returned 550 error
2009-11-30T00:29:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	first folder argument is wrong
2009-11-30T00:30:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	i assume you are running that command in the folder holding your token Movies folder ?
2009-11-30T00:30:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	yeah
2009-11-30T00:30:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	then it needs ./ infront of it
2009-11-30T00:32:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	" sudo ln -s Movies./ /srv/ftp/movies" again 550 error
2009-11-30T00:32:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	Even tried this .. " sudo ln -s Movies/ /srv/ftp/movies" again 550 error
2009-11-30T00:33:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	sudo ln -s ./Movies /srv/ftp/movies
2009-11-30T00:33:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	/srv/ftp/movies is where you want the fake folder to be or is it where the movies actually are located?
2009-11-30T00:39:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	/srv/ftp is there. i want a link or fake folder in this directory ... ur command created a link which on clicking showed the movies folder as in /srv/ftp/Movies but not from my browser when i accessed it..
2009-11-30T00:40:00.000Z	jadakren	ircuser	becuase you now need to change the permissions on the fake folder to be view able by all... try : sudo chmod 775 /srv/ftp/Movies
2009-11-30T00:41:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	thanks...
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	ircuser	jadakren	chmod: cannot operate on dangling symlink `/srv/ftp/movies'
