2012-01-13T20:51:00.000Z	scott3		my wireless connection keeps dropping on my netbook. i'm using a fresh install of 11.04
2012-01-13T20:51:00.000Z	scott3		i'd use wicd, but it freezes up the system just to connect
2012-01-13T20:51:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	I'd go to system > hardware > install new hard ware
2012-01-13T20:53:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	i'll try that now
2012-01-13T21:04:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	: i'm unable to find "add new hardware" anywhere. i've removed unity, so maybe it has something to do with the path you gave me.
2012-01-13T21:04:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	what's your ubuntu version?
2012-01-13T21:06:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	alright...just a sec
2012-01-13T21:07:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	did you do a update and upgrade ?
2012-01-13T21:07:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	yeah, a few times since i've installed 11.04
2012-01-13T21:08:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	sudo apt-get upgrade ?
2012-01-13T21:08:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	first sudo apt-get update
2012-01-13T21:08:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	but its always been sketchy. update/upgrade   gotcha
2012-01-13T21:09:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	that will take a while
2012-01-13T21:09:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	but then you should have the drivers you need
2012-01-13T21:10:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	i used unetbootin to download/install ubuntu on this machine. I've noticed that puts out a netbook specific version, but that version wasn't avail.  suggestion?
2012-01-13T21:12:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	that is to say, i noticed ubuntu puts out a netbook specific version of ubuntu. but it doesn;t show up as an option in unetbootin. suggestions
2012-01-13T21:12:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	honestly I don't have any experience with doing that so I can't tell ya
2012-01-13T21:12:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	are you trying to do a pc recover or something?
2012-01-13T21:15:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	I'd always use a virtual machine if I was you
2012-01-13T21:15:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	virtual box or vmware
2012-01-13T21:16:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	i have zero experience with either....not even sure what they are/do
2012-01-13T21:19:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	you could use virtualbox ....its free
2012-01-13T21:20:00.000Z	john_doe_jr	scott3	but those things your describing allow you to run the ubuntu os from a USB ....it's nice but virtualization is the way to go
2012-01-13T21:22:00.000Z	scott3	john_doe_jr	unetbootin allows me to create a usb version of the Disk ubuntu sends ya. i can install various linux versions
