2007-06-11T11:20:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas		I have made a typo and made a file read-only to user and to root...Is there a way to get permission to change it as root ?

2007-06-11T11:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	you can change the permissions back with sudo
2007-06-11T11:28:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	I can't, I get chmod: changing permissions of `/etc/xinetd.conf': Operation not permitted
2007-06-11T11:28:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas		I don't have permission as root
2007-06-11T11:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	'sudo chmod <whatever> /etc/xinetd.conf' does not work??
2007-06-11T11:29:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas		nope
2007-06-11T11:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	ls -al /etc/xinetd.conf
2007-06-11T11:32:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	-r-------- 1 root root 456 2007-06-10 23:26 /etc/xinetd.conf
2007-06-11T11:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	post to paste.ubuntu-nl.org the output of cat /proc/mounts

2007-06-11T11:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	i thought that maybe root fs / got mounted as read only.... not the case... i'm lost with sudo you should do everything you want...
2007-06-11T11:36:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	that's because all files have read-write permission for root

2007-06-11T11:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	 that's because all files have read-write permission for root << nothing to do with that...
2007-06-11T11:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	look here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25125/
2007-06-11T11:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	something else is broken in your setup... maybe weird permissions in /etc/ itself??
2007-06-11T11:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	post 'ls -l /' in paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-06-11T11:42:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	nothing isn't broken, i just set the wrong permission and makde it read only to everyone
2007-06-11T11:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	as you can see in the example i pasted you can change any permisions back to everything you want as easily as you changed them in the first time!!
2007-06-11T11:44:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	first you don't need to yell with !!!, second I can't do that because I don't have a permission to chenge it
2007-06-11T11:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Eric_Jardas	it seems that you do not need/want my help. Good luck (btw i recomend you to read a basic tutorial on file/dir permisions chmod and chown in unix/linux)
2007-06-11T11:47:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	... I want your help but your answer isn't working
2007-06-11T11:53:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	erUSUL	I fixed it
