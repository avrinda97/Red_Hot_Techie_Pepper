2008-11-08T09:35:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	there are 2 roots right after installation?
2008-11-08T09:35:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	no, root and your user
2008-11-08T09:35:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	just my user
2008-11-08T09:35:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	then use adduser to add it back
2008-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	whenever i do that home kidbuntu is my default before.. it says "home folder already exists" or user already exists
2008-11-08T09:37:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	how did you delete your account?
2008-11-08T09:37:00.000Z	harryinoferio		opened" systems--->users----> users and groups
2008-11-08T09:38:00.000Z	harryinoferio		is there a way that i can accesss it by doing a chmod
2008-11-08T09:38:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	i got a new admin now but the files are restricted.. i just want to have it again
2008-11-08T09:38:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	sorry i'm confused now, you need to start from the begining
2008-11-08T09:39:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	if your user account is gone, log in as root and re-add it. Otherwise it's wasn't deleted
2008-11-08T09:39:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	i did the adduser "user" on recovery console. and this is is that i'm using now
2008-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	why are you in a recovery console?
2008-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	all of my users are messed up.. heres what i did. i have my default user admin before
2008-11-08T09:41:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	i created a new one... on the second user i created i deleted the default first one. and i changed the home folder of the new one to my default one so i couldnt log in by gdm.
2008-11-08T09:41:00.000Z	waan		mhenley: yep, add the workspace switcher to the panel, then properties will let you change that
2008-11-08T09:42:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	thats why i went over to the recovery console and created this new account..
2008-11-08T09:42:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	you've totally lost me lol
2008-11-08T09:42:00.000Z	waan	harryinoferio	maybe re-install?
2008-11-08T09:43:00.000Z	harryinoferio	waan	reinstall would result to a totally reformating again right?
