2009-03-22T03:22:00.000Z	Dante123		Sony Vaio Pentium 4-1500 CPU, 256MB of PC-133 SDRAM <------------------------- Can this handle Ubuntu???
2009-03-22T03:23:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	the specs are fine for plain Ubuntu, Xubuntu might swap less
2009-03-22T03:24:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	what do yo mean by "awn"?
2009-03-22T03:25:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	the original gOS was light weight, then they went heavy, and I think they're going light again in a future release
2009-03-22T03:25:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	AWM = Avant Window Navigator, the fancy dock bar in gOS
2009-03-22T03:27:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	if it had 512 or more memory, I'd use straight Ubuntu
2009-03-22T03:28:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	if you can't get more memory, Xubuntu will run faster
2009-03-22T03:28:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	well I don't have any extra ram for this pc (except for pc100 stick but it uses pc133) so it will have to stay with 256.  Would you go Xubuntu over gOs?
2009-03-22T03:29:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	yes, like I said, recent gOS releases haven't been any lighter than standard Ubuntu
2009-03-22T03:30:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	xubuntu would work fine
2009-03-22T03:30:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	you can use just a lightweight window manager like Fluxbox, but at a sacrifice of quite a bit of functionality
2009-03-22T03:31:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	what ages are the intended users?
2009-03-22T03:33:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	I believe the kids and the mom will use it mostly.  The girls are pretty smart, aged 10 and 12
2009-03-22T03:33:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	You can look at Qimo: www.qimo4kids.com but they're at the upper-end of it's targetted age range
2009-03-22T03:33:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	disclaimer: I'm the developer of Qimo, so I'm biased
2009-03-22T03:35:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	what comes with it?  Open office?  chat client?
2009-03-22T03:39:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	does it have pidgin or chat client built in?
2009-03-22T03:40:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	it has pidgin and xchat
2009-03-22T03:41:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	i may download and try in virtualbox first.  Thanks
2009-03-22T03:42:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	leave any feedback you have, it's a 1.0 release, so we're looking for ways to improve it
2009-03-22T19:03:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	did you try Qimo?
2009-03-22T19:07:00.000Z	Dante123	mhall119	yes, and it looks really good for the younger set.....like some of my nieces and nephews.  However these girls a getting older next year grade 8 and grade 6 so I opted for full xubuntu. But will consider qimo in the future for younger set.
2009-03-22T19:08:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	you're a part of freegeek?
2009-03-22T19:09:00.000Z	mhall119	Dante123	freegeek is an organization that recycles old computers by putting Linux on them and giving them back out in their communities
