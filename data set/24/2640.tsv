2009-04-27T15:59:00.000Z	alarm		how could i install the kernel sources ? i could try that first
2009-04-27T16:00:00.000Z	alarm		i know that i need to reinstall the drivers again, thats what i am trying to do and thats where i get this error
2009-04-27T16:00:00.000Z	alarm		on the installation
2009-04-27T16:00:00.000Z	alarm		let me paste it online
2009-04-27T16:01:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	are you trying to install nvidia driver on 9.04 amd64?
2009-04-27T16:02:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	yeap. my privious nvidia installation was from the nvidia binary, not from a repo package
2009-04-27T16:02:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	why don't you use nvidia binary? it works ok for me.
2009-04-27T16:03:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	i am using the nvidia binaries , thats what i said, i dont use the deb package
2009-04-27T16:05:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	did you use "NVIDIA*** --uninstall"?
2009-04-27T16:06:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	no
2009-04-27T16:06:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	you should have used it. it removes them automatically. i did it several times. always works :)
2009-04-27T16:09:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	have you managed to uninstall it?
2009-04-27T16:11:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	did you understand what i said just now? let me rephrase it. you have to run nvidia binary driver installer with --uninstall switch. got it?
2009-04-27T16:12:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	 yeap
2009-04-27T16:12:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	try it :) let me know if it's not working
2009-04-27T16:17:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	does it work?
2009-04-27T16:18:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	may i know what error?
2009-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	why don't you use the latest 180.* or 185.*?
2009-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	i dont think this would fix the problem, i am now just unsure if i should download the linux-source-2.6.28 while i got linux-source-2.6.28-11-generic
2009-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	give me the full file name of your nvidia driver installer...
2009-04-27T16:30:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	as far as i know linux-source shouldn't be needed, but it is worth trying since you are using old driver....
2009-04-27T16:31:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	no problem. you can always uninstall it safely
2009-04-27T16:33:00.000Z	alarm	dhanar_10	from the nvidia website, the Linux AMD64/EM64T is what i need, correct ?
2009-04-27T16:34:00.000Z	dhanar_10	alarm	if you are using amd64 then yes...
