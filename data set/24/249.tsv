2012-08-27T15:55:00.000Z	Dragonfly		Hi there guys, can anybody help me with this: I have a broadcom wireless card but ubuntu treats it as an ethernet card, I cant see any wireless network here.
2012-08-27T15:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	that is the weirdest thing I've heard of on ubuntu networking...
2012-08-27T15:57:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	yes this is weird. I think that might be a problem with drivers or something but I am not sure about it.
2012-08-27T15:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	wish I could help.  sorry, but my broadcom experience is limited to getting wifi up and running.
2012-08-27T16:05:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	love to know if this works...
2012-08-27T16:17:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	um, yeah, quite possibly related...
2012-08-27T16:19:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Should I just remove the wireless kernel ? is there a particular rollback method for it ? I think that has messed with a lot of modules on my system so I am a little concerned about it
2012-08-27T16:20:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	sorry, man, mixing aircrack into the mix is way over my paygrade.  Were it me, I'd clean install and start over, but then I don't have your skill set.  Ask in the channel for advice from someone with more experience
2012-08-27T16:22:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: No problem buddy I am removing the compat wireless kernel now. lets see if that help.
2012-08-27T16:23:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: I have one more problem here, all of a sudden the fan of my laptop has stopped working. Its been a couple days now I am looking for a solution. Do you have any idea ?
2012-08-27T16:24:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	cleaning out of the vents usually works magic.  also, opening up the casing and dropping a few drops of lube on the main screw is similarly magical
2012-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Ok thanks, I'll try that too.
2012-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	good luck.
2012-08-27T16:25:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Thanks :)
2012-08-27T16:28:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Hey that did the trick :) I removed the wireless kernel and my card is again a wireless card now :)
2012-08-27T16:29:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Now the fan issue. here is something BTW. Do you think messing with Apparmor can cause that Fan failure ?
2012-08-27T16:31:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Can I just rename the network interface ? I mean my wireless card name is eth1 in ifconfig, I want it to be wlan0 ? any tip ?
2012-08-27T16:31:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	congrats on solving it.  regarding the fan: that's hardware.  Seriously can't see how app armor in any configuration could effect fan settings.  But I'd bet $ you, like most of us, have NEVER cleaned out the vents or lubed the fan.  So...
2012-08-27T16:31:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	don't know if I'd do that.  The default id's usually work best...
2012-08-27T16:33:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Default was wlan0 before I installed the wireless kernel, after installation it just got vanished and renamed to eth1. Now I want it back to wlan0.
2012-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	not something I can add any meaningful advice to.  Sorry.
2012-08-27T16:34:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: No problem, I'll try to find another way
2012-08-27T16:35:00.000Z	Dragonfly	cfhowlett	: Thank you for the help :)
2012-08-27T16:35:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Dragonfly	best of luck
