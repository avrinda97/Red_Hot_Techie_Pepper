2012-02-01T00:35:00.000Z	guest4375430		One more thing, is there a way in which I can customize the applications which are going to be installed on the system during installation, like in old days ?
2012-02-01T00:37:00.000Z	guest4375430		but I have a live cd which installs ubuntu 11.10 in GNOME version....  can I use that to customize because I dont have mini cd
2012-02-01T00:38:00.000Z	acerimmer	guest4375430	"mini" isn't a mini cd.  You'd download the ISO, burn it to a disk, boot and customize.  the iso is only  a few hundred megabytes
2012-02-01T00:41:00.000Z	guest4375430	acerimmer	yeah I know but it would be expensive for me to download 600MB or more data ...that is likely to cost about $5 .... for something which I already have free on disc
2012-02-01T00:45:00.000Z	acerimmer	guest4375430	11.10 is 23 mb.  You've probably expended that much data just in this irc...
2012-02-01T00:46:00.000Z	guest4375430	acerimmer	, lol yeah I have no probs downloading mini cd which is 26MB for me but after downloading it when I would start installing, it will download over 600MB of packages...  which will cost
2012-02-01T00:47:00.000Z	acerimmer	guest4375430	install the default, then sudo apt-get purge the packages you DON'T want?
2012-02-01T00:49:00.000Z	guest4375430	acerimmer	and how does that help ? I will still have to download about 600MB of data which I already have on free disc
2012-02-01T00:53:00.000Z	acerimmer	guest4375430	is your system mobile?  laptop?
