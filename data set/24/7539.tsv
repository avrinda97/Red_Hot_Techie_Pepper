2004-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	Kamion		you can use prelink if you want without recompiling, but said linker option means there's little point
2004-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	Kamion		-O1 to ld, or -Wl,-O1 to gcc
2004-10-23T16:44:00.000Z	Kamion		yes, our datacentre's link appears to be down ...
2004-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	is there any mirror?
2004-10-23T16:47:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	and you wouldn't happen to know the addresses of those extra repositories? The unofficial ones, I mean?
2004-10-23T16:48:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	the MP3 stuff, mono, ...
2004-10-23T16:49:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	the Google Cache page doesn't load here...
2004-10-23T16:50:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	Hedgy Hedgehog? On WEDNESDAY already???
2004-10-23T16:58:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	btw, my girlfriend got Ubuntu yesterday (she's only seen Win XP before and it's her first own computer) and she loves it.
2004-10-23T11:25:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	why don't you use RHGB?
2004-10-23T11:28:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	What does the installer have to do with the operating system _after_ it is installed?
2004-10-23T11:29:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	Oh. Then I must believe that you don't know RHGB?
2004-10-23T11:32:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	Not yet, but I can if it would help you.
2004-10-23T11:36:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	but isn't Ubuntu a desktop-centric distribution? How will it work without X?
2004-10-23T11:37:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	The text mode installer displays just fine.
2004-10-23T11:37:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	And if these users require manual configuration for X, where's the difference in doing it at install time?
2004-10-23T11:38:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	But it's not displaying pictures. For example, the isolinux picture isn't showing up here.
2004-10-23T11:45:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	do you know the bug number of the Totem-showing-only-a-blue-screen-bug?
2004-10-23T11:58:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	no...
2004-10-23T11:58:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	but scrollkeeper is installed...
2004-10-23T11:59:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	There's only /usr/bin/scrollkeeper-uninstall
2004-10-23T12:00:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	returns without ouput.
2004-10-23T12:01:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	<[rapha] > Keybuk: there's a couple of scrollkeeper-*, but no -update.
2004-10-23T12:13:00.000Z	[rapha] 	Kamion	just out of curiosity, how does this work "under the hood"? Taking the the user's password for root, that is.
