2008-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	go to system->administration->printing add it find your model etc it'll work flawlessly
2008-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	the printer does not show up, however, the vista pc shows up, but when I click on it, it doesn't show any printers.  same with folders, but I can access them with the right name.
2008-08-25T08:31:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	system->administration->printing then new printer choose windows printer with samba, type the name of your vista machine(may have to type ip) followed by the shared printer name.

2008-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	is the printer a hewlet packard?
2008-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	I'll type in that line using your way. it's the line I'm having trouble with now.
2008-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	are u sure the printer is shared on vista? can u see it using that browse button?
2008-08-25T08:34:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	I cannot see it with the browse button, but I can print from my vista laptop to it.
2008-08-25T08:35:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	the printer is connected to the laptop? using usb cable?
2008-08-25T08:35:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	whats the general setup?
2008-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	My vista pc acts as as the 'server' and a normal desktop to.  A networked laptop using vista can print from it. I file share from ubuntu off of it.
2008-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	all there is to it smb:///newname/printer
2008-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	u just have to know the shared name of the printer cause the one that vista shows in printers and faxes is something else
2008-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	I'll go check to make sure I have the 'shared' name  I may just have the normal name.

2008-08-25T08:47:00.000Z	usser	Joeseph	so does it print from ubuntu?
2008-08-25T08:48:00.000Z	Joeseph	usser	I've added it now, I'm about to test it...... but it's not my vista computer....
