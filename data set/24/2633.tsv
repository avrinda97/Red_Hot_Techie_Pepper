2008-10-16T16:19:00.000Z	jerryz		i put some folder under picasa folder, using nautilus opened from terminal, but now the folders are inaccessible, please help
2008-10-16T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	what folder exactly?
2008-10-16T16:20:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	i copy some web template into web template folder under picasa
2008-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	what is the path to the folder that is giving you issues?
2008-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	now i see that there's "x" mark beside the inaccessible folders
2008-10-16T16:22:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	it's: opt/picasa/wine/drive_c/Program FIles/Picasa2/web/templates
2008-10-16T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	ok.  What does this command return: ls -ld '/opt/picasa/wine/drive_c/Program FIles/Picasa2/web/templates'
2008-10-16T16:26:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	it said cannot access bla bla bla, no such file or directory
2008-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	write "Files" instead of "FIles" maybe
2008-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	ya i did write Files
2008-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	the path you gave me originally had "FIles".  Does that work?
2008-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	it was my mistype
2008-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	btw, I've just been thinking, if I open nautilus as root (sudo nautilus from terminal), and try to see the folder permission properties, maybe it can help?
2008-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	let me see first and I report again if I can do something or not
2008-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	that would be one way yes, but I won't understand what you are doing then
2008-10-16T16:33:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	just now I see that for some default folders there, the permissions properties for "group" and "others" folders are set as "access files" versus "none" in the inaccessible folders
2008-10-16T16:33:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	I think it is the problem
2008-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	sure, check ownership as well
2008-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	it works
2008-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	ownership is still root
2008-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	so to solve the problem, change the folder access right in the properties of the folder, via nautilus (open as root)
2008-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	thanks for your response & help, though
2008-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	jerryz	glad you figured it out
2008-10-16T16:38:00.000Z	jerryz	jrib	thanks, have a nice day :-)
