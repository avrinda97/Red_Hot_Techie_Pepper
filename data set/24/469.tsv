2011-08-11T02:31:00.000Z	intrader		Anyone, ubuntu 10.10 hangs during boot while displaying ubuntu with the four repeating dots.  What can I provide as info?
2011-08-11T02:32:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	did you mess with the gdm
2011-08-11T02:32:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	you might have messed up your login screen
2011-08-11T02:33:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	no I did not - it does come up in recovery mode requiring login.
2011-08-11T02:34:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	huh, man im not sure about that one, try googling the problem exactly, and you man have to reword it a few times, but thats what i do when i forget something or need to learn something new it usually finds something, but you may have to reinstall
2011-08-11T02:36:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	how do I reinstall and retain Windows, and two linuces (one in sda7, the old one ins sda5).
2011-08-11T02:38:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	are you running windows right now
2011-08-11T02:39:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	or are you running dual boot
2011-08-11T02:39:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	no, using the recovery version . I have dual boot.
2011-08-11T02:40:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	man ive never even done a dual boot, except for wubi a long ass time ago, id have to do some reading honestly real fast, stay on
2011-08-11T02:41:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	in this mode I don't even get controls in frame of windows.
2011-08-11T02:43:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	so you are running straight from terminal
2011-08-11T02:43:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	in the recovery mode it allowed me to restart X
2011-08-11T02:45:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	man, im sorry but in one reply explain to me your whole problem, im gonna try and find a solution online somewhere real fast, i think this happened to me a while back with wubi, if i remember correctly.
2011-08-11T02:47:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	I am not running wubi.
2011-08-11T02:52:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	here I go - yesterday It was running 10.10 with one user only, but showing in Places the folder for the previous version. From this I recoverer the setting for google chromium, firefox, and tomboy. The I installed an update to allow me to see the iPod. At the end of this synaptic tells me that a partial upgrade is necessary. When I try to reboot, it does not fully boot but hangs on the startup before the login screen.
2011-08-11T02:54:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	on Friday, I had tried the upgrade to 11.04 path, and got it to hung with the Caps lock and disk light solid. I then decided to install 10.10.
2011-08-11T02:55:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	son of a bitch, whats the programs name
2011-08-11T02:56:00.000Z	nocsutud	intrader	and if you are using 10.10 why the f did you have to install an update to see the ipod, it should just show up automatically
2011-08-11T02:59:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	the web page detailing the iPod stuff that got in trouble: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/12/get-ios4-mountsync-working-in-ubuntu.html. At the end of the last step, synaptic warms me that a partial upgrade is necessary.
2011-08-11T03:14:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	sorry, should i wait longer?
2011-08-11T03:21:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	sorry, should i wait longer?
2011-08-11T03:27:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	sorry, should i wait longer?
2011-08-11T03:30:00.000Z	intrader	nocsutud	I will try the reinstall 10.10 route - I have not heard from you.
