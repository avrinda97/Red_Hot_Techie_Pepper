2011-04-27T19:56:00.000Z	fruitwerks		anyone know a good grub2 how-to
2011-04-27T19:57:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	what u trying to do?
2011-04-27T19:59:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	- well I had a crappy setup, so what I did was rsync everything to a single drive, single partition like I wanted it in the first place, the drive had legacy grub on it, and I attempted to install grub2 to it, but I can't boot off of it anymore
2011-04-27T19:59:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	theres an os on this drive?
2011-04-27T20:00:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	- there is now a clone of my working install on there
2011-04-27T20:00:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	and ur in ubuntu now?
2011-04-27T20:02:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	the easiest way to do this is for you to dl an app called "grub customizer" ask google and add the PPA to your software centre. after its installed run "os-prober". that will create an entry in the customizer, and then u can simply add it to the grub2 menu, all GUI style
2011-04-27T20:03:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	this is a headless install - and the new drive no longer boots after I apparently improperly installed grub2, it boots off the old drive
2011-04-27T20:04:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	ok this makes ur life more difficult. u got a live CD?
2011-04-27T20:05:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	sorry, i thought u said it wasnt booting? what OS are u getting into?
2011-04-27T20:06:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	lol.. ok sorry - I can boot my current and working setup, I am unable to boot to a NEW disk (that had a working grub legacy install) with an rsync of my working system on it
2011-04-27T20:06:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	if u just want to boot the partition I suggest PLoP, more so I suggest the "Ultimate Boot CD" which has PLoP on it and can boot any partition independetly of the HDD
2011-04-27T20:06:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	ok, so u are in ubuntu 10.x?
2011-04-27T20:07:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	- yes I am in my working setup - I just need to properly install grub2 to another disk which will become the new root
2011-04-27T20:08:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	ok go to console and "sudo os-prober" tell me what it says
2011-04-27T20:08:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	after mounting your rsync'd partition
2011-04-27T20:09:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	anything else?
2011-04-27T20:09:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	no that was all
2011-04-27T20:09:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	yes, sda1 is what I need booting
2011-04-27T20:10:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	no google "grub customizer" and install it. i suggest u use ubuntu sofwatre centre by adding the PPA listed on that page
2011-04-27T20:11:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	- does that have a cli? this is a headless system
2011-04-27T20:11:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	what u mean "headless" system?
2011-04-27T20:11:00.000Z	fruitwerks	LAcan	as in no monitor, ssh only
2011-04-27T20:12:00.000Z	LAcan	fruitwerks	hrmmm. u would know about that better than me... check out the page for GC and see what it says, ive only used the GUI version but im certain theres a terminal version as well
