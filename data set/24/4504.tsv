2007-03-24T07:45:00.000Z	tbuss		looking for canon i950 driver install help
2007-03-24T05:02:00.000Z	tbuss		new to ubuntu can anyone help with screen display problem, vertical lines appear when using 1280x1024
2007-03-24T05:03:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	sounds like a refresh rate problem
2007-03-24T05:03:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	or possibly an unsupported restolution
2007-03-24T05:03:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	is it safe to experiment with refresh rates without damage to lcd?
2007-03-24T05:04:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	first I would check to see what your native resolution is on that LCD
2007-03-24T05:04:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	LCD's only have one true resolution, everything else is interpolated
2007-03-24T05:05:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	I manually changed the xorg.conf to support the higher resolution.
2007-03-24T05:05:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	60hz should be safe though, don't use anything below
2007-03-24T05:05:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	that might not be a good idea if your monitor doesn't support that higher resolution
2007-03-24T05:06:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	I checked, the monitor supports it, brand new Sceptre
2007-03-24T05:08:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	then make sure you have a proper refresh rate, should be between 60-85hz, though higher hz can cause this affect if they are unsupported.   Even 80hz can cause this issue on some displays at certain resolutions
2007-03-24T05:08:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	tried 75Hz, 70hz, and 60Hz with 1080x1024, vertical lines for all three; nothing avail above 75Hz
2007-03-24T05:08:00.000Z	Belboz91		wait, 1080x1024?
2007-03-24T05:09:00.000Z	Belboz91		no one runs at that resolution, that's practically square tbuss
2007-03-24T05:09:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	so 1024x768 is good?
2007-03-24T05:10:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	yes
2007-03-24T05:10:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	other resolutions that are common are 1280x1024, and 1280x1080 for a wide screen
2007-03-24T05:11:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	I should only use 1280x1024 if my monitor is a widescreen?
2007-03-24T05:12:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	I just thought the higher resolution looked "cleaner" there was more space avail.
2007-03-24T05:12:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	no, you can use 1280x1024 for a standard screen
2007-03-24T05:13:00.000Z	tbuss	Belboz91	any suggestion off hand on links for info on screen resolutions?
2007-03-24T05:13:00.000Z	Belboz91	tbuss	try running:
