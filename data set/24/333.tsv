2011-11-15T22:58:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	i have to type some commands every time i boot my system to let my computer know where grub is installed
2011-11-15T22:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	so you have more then one OS? Have you run sudo update-grub when your in the ubuntu/
2011-11-15T23:00:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	nope i have just one, ubuntu
2011-11-15T23:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	have you run sudo update-grub once your in?
2011-11-15T23:00:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	i didnt make a separate partition for the boot, so i installed it inside one of the ext4 parts
2011-11-15T23:01:00.000Z	a34154ek		blueskaj: okay
2011-11-15T23:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	install grub to the mbr ten if it is not the if sda it would be from the ubuntu terminal sudo grub-install /dev/sda
2011-11-15T23:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	run sudo fdsik -l to confirm the HD letters sda or sdb then run that command with the correct one the sudo update-grub
2011-11-15T23:02:00.000Z	urlin2u		then*
2011-11-15T23:03:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	which partition would the grub be installed to if i write  sudo grub-install /dev/sda
2011-11-15T23:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	the grub files for the partition are alraedy there it sound like
2011-11-15T23:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	the partiotion grub files and the grub stuff for the sda=mbr talk to each other4.
2011-11-15T23:04:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	my grub resides in dev/sda8/boot/grub
2011-11-15T23:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	what is the partition that the ubuntu is in the root?
2011-11-15T23:05:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	root is in sda8 as well :p
2011-11-15T23:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	cool and that is the partition used with the manual boot?
2011-11-15T23:06:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	yup
2011-11-15T23:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	you didn't make a boot partition correct, just installed grub to that partition?
2011-11-15T23:07:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	ubuntu asks where to install the bootloader while installing the os; i chose sda8 :p
2011-11-15T23:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	okay your fine you just need grub installed in the mbr with this command run from your booted sda8 sudo grub-install /dev/sda  then run sudo update-grub
2011-11-15T23:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	a34154ek	gotta go that should work others will help if you need more help.
2011-11-15T23:09:00.000Z	a34154ek	urlin2u	unh, again - where will the grub go if i do what u say?
