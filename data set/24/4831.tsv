2007-01-01T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	I'd hardly think the number of bugs is indicative of "goodness", but Im sure quite a few of us would love to talk about it, but in #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-01-01T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	kernel major versions are frozen each release, so never.
2007-01-01T14:47:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	oh, you're talking about patches, not kernel versions.
2007-01-02T13:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	please don't recommend automatix here.
2007-01-02T13:50:00.000Z	jasin	Flannel	where did I do that? Please, do tell me.
2007-01-02T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	we've seen plenty of people coming here with broken installs, having used automatix.
2007-01-02T13:57:00.000Z	jasin	Flannel	i'm sure you do, but some stupid script that's just merely an interface for apt-get is hardly going to take down someone's system.
2007-01-02T13:57:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	it's not an interface for apt-get, and it does take down systems.  However, this is offtopic, if you'd like to continue to discuss this, we can do it in #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-01-02T13:58:00.000Z	jasin	Flannel	like I told idle, so you say.
2007-01-02T13:58:00.000Z	jasin	Flannel	and yes it is, it modifies sources.lst
2007-01-02T13:59:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	I could care less if you continue to use it.  But do NOT recommend it here.
2007-04-20T16:38:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	please stop spamming
2007-04-20T16:39:00.000Z	jasin	Flannel	posting the ubuntu website in #ubuntu is spamming? ROFL
2007-06-13T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	jasin	yes
