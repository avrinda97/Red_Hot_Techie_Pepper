2009-05-20T20:09:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	orbit listening on a low (<1024) port is kinda weird, afaik
2009-05-20T20:09:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	Slart: orbit is an ipc mechanism used by a couple of gnome things, mainly the panel (to communicate with applets)
2009-05-20T20:10:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	Strange... so why is it listening on Samba?
2009-05-20T20:10:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	that's what I don't understand. Also, to even do that at all it'd have to be launched as root, which is weird.
2009-05-20T20:12:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	luke@luke-desktop:~$ netstat -an 1 | grep 445: tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:445             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     11445    /tmp/orbit-luke/linc-d70-0-5315a2b9a087c
2009-05-20T20:14:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	that's really weird output. Those /tmp/orbit-blah/linc-blah things should be sockets, not executables. So getting "tcp" there makes no sense, should be "unix". Can you run "file /tmp/orbit-luke/linc-d70-0-5315a2b9a087c"?
2009-05-20T20:15:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	"netstat -an 1|grep orbit" gives me output like "unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     5929     /tmp/orbit-mzz/linc-9e9-0-3801cf8813dac" and "unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     241229   /tmp/orbit-mzz/linc-732e-0-1566ea5b1382b"
2009-05-20T20:16:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	hmm I see...
2009-05-20T20:16:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	doesn't appear to execute
2009-05-20T20:16:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	so either your netstat is being weird (compared to mine at least) or you have an executable cleverly disguised in a location normally used by sockets
2009-05-20T20:16:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	I didn't mean attempt to run it, I meant run "file" on it to see what it is
2009-05-20T20:17:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	Oh :P  ... well I'm going to try viewing them with gedit. Somethings there...
2009-05-20T20:17:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	that shouldn't work if they're sockets. Can you please try "file"?
2009-05-20T20:18:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	sure, trying now
2009-05-20T20:18:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	/tmp/orbit-luke/linc-d70-0-5315a2b9a087c: socket
2009-05-20T20:19:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	tha'ts the output.
2009-05-20T20:19:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	then imho your netstat is being weird
2009-05-20T20:20:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	Strange. lol. So how can I bind the honeypot since the port is indeed in use by something? When I configure Firestarter to allow port 445, nmap says it's wide open, but nepenthes remains "unbinded".
2009-05-20T20:21:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	not sure what's going on here. That netstat output is weird. Wonder if anyone in here currently running ubuntu (which I'm not) gets the same?
2009-05-20T20:21:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	and Slart: Thanks for answering btw, I knew I wasn't going insane. XD (generally port 445 isn't bound to a port that low).
2009-05-20T20:38:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	so the port was in use by nepenthes and netstat was just confused?
2009-05-20T20:41:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	mzz	Yes, what is strange was nepenthes does not appear on gnome-monitor. Evidently it was not binding properly in nepenthes because it was already running and bound to all the ports. I simply had to "sudo pkill nepenthes" and then "sudo nepenthes". Now I'm allowing a lot of ports on FireStarter and all is good. Netstat was confused as well.
2009-05-20T20:42:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	sounds like your gnome-system-monitor is only showing you your own processes (iirc that's the default)
2009-05-20T20:42:00.000Z	mzz	Gaming4JC	there's an "all processes" thing somewher
