2010-04-04T05:51:00.000Z	tripelb		UBUNTU FREEZES, no keyboard lites, no flashing, wont recover on ^SysRq+REISUB  - worked for days, several hulu then freezes, then in first few mins of hulu, then first seconds. (Ch or FF)  Been trailing this for weeks.  --- oops RemCogito has left. he asked what flash package I was running. I would say whatever comes with the browser.
2010-04-04T05:53:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	memtest?
2010-04-04T05:55:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	I did that and it was CLEAN. I ran it throught the whole thing.
2010-04-04T05:55:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	one pass or more? from livecd?
2010-04-04T05:57:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	memtest runs infinitely. are you sure it's the same thing?
2010-04-04T05:58:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	I pressed escape and went to the text screen. When I looked back in the mornig it said it was complete.
2010-04-04T05:59:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	It was the third time I ran memtest. Each time I report that I did it I get told I need to do more. One time explaining it or linking me to an explanation would be superior.
2010-04-04T06:00:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	i'm a little surprised that it can be misunderstood is all. how are you running it? grub1 menu entry?
2010-04-04T06:01:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	karmic (9.10 and newer) use grub2, so i make the distinction now :)
2010-04-04T06:02:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	I am using 9.10 I apologize for not specifying it. (I said I've been doing this for 2 weeks now, coming here when the freeze cycle gets shorter and I am frustrated.)
2010-04-04T06:02:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	so once it starts up, you get the main window, leave it there and don't press anything for hours and hours :D you'll see the "Pass" # increment, 3 passes or more would be nice
2010-04-04T06:02:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	i see, was the computer new, recently?
2010-04-04T06:03:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	no computer I have is noe recently. BIG LOL.
2010-04-04T06:03:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	no computer I have is NEW recently. BIG LOL.
2010-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	what's so amusing?
2010-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	 I'm not laughing that was someone laughing at me
2010-04-04T06:07:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	 I'm not laughing that was someone laughing at me for having no new computer. I had a new Averatec but it dies over a year ago and I gave ti away last week. It was a laptop and it worked and then fell prey to "known problems" in the charging circuit overheating. The company fell down too. But think of it that was 6 years ago and it would have been out to lunch anyway.
2010-04-04T06:08:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	thanks for the back story, more interested in the age of the computer and how long since getting it this problem began ;)
2010-04-04T06:10:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	I was using wubi ubuntu on other drives before.
2010-04-04T06:11:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	hmm, ok well i can't think what to suggest to diagnose that one.
2010-04-04T06:12:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	thank you.
2010-04-04T06:12:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	is there anything NOT released when I go down hard. That I could fix now and reboot?
2010-04-04T06:13:00.000Z	daftykins	tripelb	no idea what you mean
2010-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	tripelb	daftykins	Thank you for your help. I am off helping someone else on a matter far less computer. lol
