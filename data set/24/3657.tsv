2008-01-10T16:44:00.000Z	deostroll		How do you enable NUM LOCK while os loads?
2008-01-10T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	isn't that some kind of bios setting?
2008-01-10T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	sorry.. didn't read the log properly...
2009-04-27T12:17:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	lsb_release -a
2009-04-27T12:20:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	I think so, yes
2009-04-27T12:21:00.000Z	deostroll	Slart	any linux based os...?
2009-04-27T12:21:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	lsb is short for Linux Standard Base or something.. google for it.. I think most distros has the lsb modules
2009-04-27T12:22:00.000Z	deostroll	Slart	on my terminal it first prints "No LSB modules are available..." and then prints the rest...
2009-04-27T12:23:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	mm.. there are several lsb modules iirc.. but check out the lsb site.. I'm sure they have some kind of explanation
2009-04-27T12:24:00.000Z	deostroll	Slart	thanx for the info anyway :)
2009-04-27T12:24:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	you're welcome
2010-01-15T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	probably quite many.. yes
2010-01-15T00:37:00.000Z	deostroll	Slart	thot it had an install issue when it was released...?
2010-01-15T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	hmm.. nothing I noticed when I installed it.. haven't heard anything about it here either
2010-01-15T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	9.04 had some issues with intel graphics.. but I don't remember anything that serious with 9.10
2010-03-15T22:57:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#alternate
2010-03-15T22:58:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	or you meant a direct link to the iso file?
2010-03-16T21:11:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	yes
2010-03-16T21:12:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	now why didn't you ask that question to the channel the first time?
2010-03-16T21:13:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	no.. I meant.. why did you have to ask the first question (if any1 heard of gwget).. you clearly had another question in mind..
2010-03-16T21:13:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	try asking the channel again.. "Does gwget support pause and resume of downloading?"
2010-03-16T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	deostroll	ask the channel.. not me
