2010-08-12T04:53:00.000Z	bichonfrise74		I have a dual boot (windows and ubuntu 10.04), is it possible to increase my disk space / partition to ubuntu?
2010-08-12T04:53:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	I can't remember how, but the answer is yes, but its also dangerous
2010-08-12T04:54:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	you could lose all sorts of windows things
2010-08-12T04:54:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- so the better method I guess would be to uninstall ubuntu, and install it again with bigger size?
2010-08-12T04:54:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	did you already resize the windows partition ?
2010-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- I have not done anything yet.
2010-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	so windows and ubuntu are on the same drive ? correect ?
2010-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- that is correct.
2010-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	have you installed ubuntu already?
2010-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- yes,
2010-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- windows and ubuntu are running side by side.
2010-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	then the harm is done already, does windows partition have tons of spare space ?
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- yup, tons of space.
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	then I would just clean the drive, defrag and whatnot, and resize it,
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- Initially I just wanted to test ubuntu... but now I am loving it very much that I want to use it more.
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	though its dangerous, keep in mind
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	if you just need space, I would suggest simply mounting the other partition.
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- thanks
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- what do you mean mounting the other partition?
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- maybe that is just want I need?
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	yup, you just want access to the windows-side of the spare hd space, so don't resize ubuntu and windows
2010-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/mountwindows
2010-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	agoole	bichonfrise74	that should start you off
2010-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	bichonfrise74	agoole	- thanks.
