2007-02-08T09:23:00.000Z	xelados		The only stuff I have to worry about are media codecs and Fx plugins.
2007-02-08T09:23:00.000Z	xelados		Because not all 64-bit codecs or plugins have been made yet
2007-02-08T09:24:00.000Z	xelados		You can still get'em to work through howtos like firefox32, etc though
2007-02-08T09:24:00.000Z	xelados		Automatix and EasyUbuntu help, too

2007-02-08T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Please don't recommend Automatix
2007-02-08T09:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Upgrades will completely ruin your Ubuntu install if you have used Automatix, at least it is very likely it will screw it up, if it doesn't then you are lucky
2007-02-08T09:26:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	as in, 'apt-get dist-upgrade' style?
2007-02-08T09:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	No, as in gksu "update-manager -c" style ( don't dist-upgrade to Edgy unless you have read the upgrade notes )
2007-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Reading the wiki or if needed easyubuntu
2007-02-08T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Can't you just choose it as the session when logging in and then save it as the new default when it asks you?
2007-02-08T09:36:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	in xdm? I didn't see an option for it anywhere. It's just a login dialog
2007-02-08T10:10:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	in xdm? I didn't see an option for it anywhere. It's just a login dialog
2007-02-08T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	You could use gdm instead of xdm?
2007-02-08T10:19:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	I'd prefer to stay away from GNOME and KDE. :\
2007-02-08T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	It's not gnome, it's just Gnome's DM
2007-02-08T10:20:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	Doesn't it rely on GNOME for its API or libs?
2007-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Yea, but I think most of those libs are required for XFCE also, try running apt-get install gdm and see what it says it will need to install.
2007-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	I'm also not using XFCE, but will do.
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Oh, I thought you had mentioned it before, my mistake
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	xelados	Jordan_U	No problem. I'm sorry if I sound impatient or cranky. Just trying to learn and wade through it all. :)
2007-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	Great :)
2007-03-03T14:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	top
2007-03-03T14:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xelados	kill or killall
