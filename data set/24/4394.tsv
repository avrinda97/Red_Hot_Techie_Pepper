2007-08-20T08:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	no, i hope you have a good backup
2007-08-20T08:54:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	how do i make a back up right now
2007-08-20T08:55:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	u mean i need an external hdd and then i can move data form my hdd via the live cd into the extern hdd???
2007-08-20T08:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	you should be able to.
2007-08-20T08:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	if you don't have two DVD drives(one for the live CD, one for the blank), i dont think you can
2007-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	probably not htat stuff, but maybe..... i'd just download the current version, Feisty Fawn 7.04
2007-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	should i try and remove the repositories form ultimate and then do a sudo apt-get distupgrade or maybe downgrade?
2007-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	youc an't downgrade.
2007-08-20T09:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	but before you do anything absurdly stupid(which you're about to do), id' backup
2007-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	you have to tell it what to edit.
2007-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	how do i back up from here, i dont have 2 dvd burners and i dont have 2 hdd
2007-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	then you have a real problem
2007-08-20T09:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	i don't think that will work, but it might.
2007-08-20T09:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	the file you edit, unless you mount your ubuntu drive, is going to be the file for the live CD..
2007-08-20T09:06:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	this happened once before, something similar and someone in here walked me through the live cd stuff and we dug into the OS and fixed the problem and then i rebooted and it all worked wagagin
2007-08-20T09:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	biodeath666	then i would find someone
2007-08-20T09:55:00.000Z	biodeath666	IndyGunFreak	u there
