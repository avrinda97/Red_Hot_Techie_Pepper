2006-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	Ramnath		i still don' t understand how to install things i download off of the internet
2006-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	Ramnath		tar.gz files
2006-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	most often you don't need to
2006-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	that's what apt is for
2006-03-16T14:33:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	you can run it natively
2006-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	that doesn't mean anything
2006-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	... it's really not that hard
2006-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	I'm pretty sure there's even a howto
2006-03-16T14:38:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	it's really not that hard
2006-03-16T14:38:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	just need to read the howto
2006-03-16T14:42:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	they're not going to auto-run
2006-03-16T14:43:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	you have to open them up and select what you want (except possibly for audio cd's)
2006-03-16T14:43:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	..... what exactly are you trying to do?
2006-03-16T14:44:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	one at a time. Which game are you trying now?
2006-03-16T14:44:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	ok
2006-03-16T14:45:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	you've installed wine already?
2006-03-16T14:46:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	actually.. what video card do you have?
2006-03-16T14:51:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	you need to either give up and go groveling back to you MS masters or suck it up.
2006-03-16T14:51:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	So far you've mentioned trying to install warcraft3 and doom3 both of which are very well supported under wine or natively respectively
2006-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	if you've actually installed wine you can probably just double click the setup.exe file on your warcraft 3 cd
2006-03-16T14:54:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	you don't need to do anything with winecfg for that
2006-03-16T14:57:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	what exactly happens when you double click install.exe
2006-03-16T14:58:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	try from a terminal
2006-03-16T14:59:00.000Z	polpak	Ramnath	cd /media/cdrom && wine install.exe
