2007-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	I told you already
2007-06-02T05:00:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	and some highports for PASV support
2007-06-02T05:02:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	by default it most probably uses system accounts
2007-06-02T05:02:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	just use scp from ssh. much better than ftp
2007-06-02T05:03:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	can i use my root user/pass in ftp ?
2007-06-02T05:04:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	can u check it ftp://cable-202-8-235-235.d-one.net
2007-06-02T05:05:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	no root access with ftp
2007-06-02T05:05:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	is it working now ftp://cable-202-8-235-235.d-one.net ?
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	I didn't ask you, but good choice. you need a system user (sudo adduser for example) for it
2007-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	edit /etc/vsftpd.conf to enable anon access
2007-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	can u check it ftp://cable-202-8-235-235.d-one.net
2007-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	I don't think so
2007-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	can u give the high pssv port for vstpd
2007-06-02T05:17:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	no. it depends on whatever you set
2007-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	rOb3rt	wols	cant even login my ftp in local
2007-06-19T07:57:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	not unless you ask me a question
2007-06-19T08:00:00.000Z	wols	rOb3rt	not until you answer my question
