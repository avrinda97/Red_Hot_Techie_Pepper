2005-03-07T13:03:00.000Z	SiRrUs	Kallicat	same here
2005-03-07T13:03:00.000Z	SiRrUs		I know it will work cause it does through mandrake
2005-03-07T13:04:00.000Z	Kallicat		*nods* what kinda palm for you? mine's a zire 31
2005-03-07T13:05:00.000Z	SiRrUs		zire 72
2005-03-07T13:05:00.000Z	Kallicat		heh
2005-03-07T13:05:00.000Z	SiRrUs		just got it had you model previous
2005-03-07T13:06:00.000Z	Kallicat		*nods* yeah, they're good little toys
2005-03-07T13:06:00.000Z	SiRrUs		:)
2005-03-07T13:06:00.000Z	Kallicat		getting the palm up under linux is the last critical thing before I can go all linux
2005-03-07T13:07:00.000Z	SiRrUs		Like I said I know its possible I had it working with mandrake using jpilot
2005-03-07T13:07:00.000Z	Kallicat		yep
2005-03-07T13:08:00.000Z	Kallicat		I tried a dmesg | less to see if any of the error messages looked relevant, but none of 'em rang a bell
2005-03-07T13:08:00.000Z	Kallicat		not even to my two full time sysadmin buddies
2005-03-07T13:08:00.000Z	SiRrUs		but there got to be a way
2005-03-07T13:08:00.000Z	Kallicat		yah
2005-03-07T13:08:00.000Z	Kallicat		did you find the right device id for yours?
2005-03-07T13:09:00.000Z	SiRrUs		nope
2005-03-07T13:10:00.000Z	Kallicat		hrm, that might be your probelm
2005-03-07T13:10:00.000Z	Kallicat		*problem
2005-03-07T13:23:00.000Z	Kallicat		hrm, it looks like pilot-link package might have the necessary device code info for a zire series palm
2005-03-07T13:23:00.000Z	Kallicat		dunno that it'd solve my problem tho
2005-03-07T13:28:00.000Z	Kallicat	hawke	since my zire doesn't sync, it's kind of a problem for me...
2005-03-07T13:28:00.000Z	SiRrUs	Kallicat	if your still here I just did any time apt-update there are updates for gnome pilot
