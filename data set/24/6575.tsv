2006-05-21T15:50:00.000Z	NET||abuse		hmm, how well will the upgrade from breezy to dapper go on release?
2006-05-21T15:50:00.000Z	NET||abuse		do we expect very few bugs, resonably stable?
2006-05-21T15:51:00.000Z	NET||abuse		i'm thinking of setting up a box to start running my own little snmp network monitor setup, but after i get the basic graphing done, i need to register events in a database, but the db i have to use is mysql5... nd breezy having no libmysqlclient15 available through deb is a kick in the sack
2006-05-21T15:52:00.000Z	NET||abuse		but if i can get the initial setup and graphing running on breezy and do a worry free upgrade to dapper,,, then it'd take some of the bite out of the whole situation
2006-05-21T15:53:00.000Z	NET||abuse		hmm, mustn't have the needed utils package
2006-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	NET||abuse		it's like a credit card coupon, you put a certain amount of money into it, the bank gives you a temporary cc number, and you can spend that online
2006-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	NET||abuse		so you don't need an actual visa/mastercard whatever
2006-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	why would you want to setup a server which is supposed to be stable with a version you're not sure about based on the possibility of a worry-free upgrade?
2006-05-21T15:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	well it's more to just get the second part up and running asap.. if the service has interuptions due to problems after the initial upgrade, and not during.. then i have deniability :)
2006-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	it's a numbers game with the guys in here.. if it's the os's fault, then that's ok, fix it and move on.. if it goes into upgrade and never gets working at all again... well then i'm in trouble cause i'm the one doing the upgrade
2006-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	and i have to use libmysqlclient15..
2006-05-21T15:57:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	why don't you wait for a month until dapper comes out and set it up cleanly on that?
2006-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	dapper has 5 years of support as a server platform, by the time you get around to upgrading it'll be due for replacement.
2006-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	can't, just happens the deadline for this fits in for one week after dapers new release
2006-05-21T15:58:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	break the deadline or setup straight after dapper is released. I'd go for the former.
2006-05-21T15:59:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	you're better off doing the job properly in the first place
2006-05-21T16:00:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	you can't really show anything working if the database end doesn't work.
2006-05-21T16:00:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	we need to be able to walk away from this with proceedures left behind to maintain it(sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; //that kinda lark)
2006-05-21T16:00:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	you just can't do that.
2006-05-21T16:01:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	no system requires that little maintenance.
2006-05-21T16:01:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	obviously i'm understating the proceedures for maintenance, the initial graphing won't be databased, they have another method for that,, it's all been planned by someone else.. i just trying to get it done
2006-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	if you need something to show by tomorrow and you need to run this on dapper but have a deadline a week after the dapper release, it hasn't been planned properly.
2006-05-21T16:02:00.000Z	NET||abuse	njan	your telling me :)
2006-05-21T16:11:00.000Z	njan	NET||abuse	I know it sounds obvious, but I've worked on lots of projects like that one and you don't do anyone any favours by just doing a shit job.
