2009-11-18T08:01:00.000Z	arghh2d2	brainy142	i dunno, i'd say it was prbly something you installed that wasnt ready for 9.10 but you said it happende right after you installed...maybe try reinstalling gdm

2009-11-18T08:04:00.000Z	brainy142	arghh2d2	how would I do that?
2009-11-18T08:04:00.000Z	arghh2d2	brainy142	sudo apt-get install gdm
