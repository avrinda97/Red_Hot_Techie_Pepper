2008-03-25T08:30:00.000Z	Concretesledge		hello
2008-03-25T08:31:00.000Z	Concretesledge		im trying to install ubuntu, i have 3 IDE drives, hda hdb hdc
2008-03-25T08:31:00.000Z	Concretesledge		i want ALL 3 to be used for the installation, someone said somethinga bout LVM But i dont understand
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	you can have a logical volume which crosses multiple physical volumes
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	then you can create a single partition on that logical volume, if you want
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	(or any number of partitions)
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	, so make them all logical?
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	no.  you use LVM, and add all the hard drives to a volume group
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	, i didnt see LVM anywhere in the ubuntu install im on live right now
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	this is completely different than "logical partitions"
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	which version?  i'm not sure if they even had it in gutsy
2008-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	don' t know
2008-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	7.10
2008-03-25T08:35:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	 there where no options in the partition managers, where would it be?
2008-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	maybe i can use UBCD, to format them or something AS one large partition?
2008-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	no.  you have to use LVM
2008-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	i would check to see if lvm made it  into gutsy
2008-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	 what exactly is LVM
2008-03-25T08:39:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	Logical Volume Manager
2008-03-25T08:40:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	 could you please tell me how i could find LVM on the ubuntu install disc, while im installing im on a live right now
2008-03-25T08:40:00.000Z	Concretesledge	pestilence	 could i install and alt-tab to talk in here?
2008-03-25T08:41:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	i don't think gutsy's live cd has it.  and i kind of doubt that hardy has it either
2008-03-25T08:41:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	from google:  http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem
2008-03-25T08:42:00.000Z	pestilence	Concretesledge	but with that, i'd say good luck...i have to go to bed.
