2011-01-21T23:34:00.000Z	leachim6		hey
2011-01-21T23:34:00.000Z	leachim6		so....I have ubuntu 10.10....and my suspend used to work (on a laptop) but now it doesn't....
2011-01-21T23:35:00.000Z	leachim6		I think it might have something to do with laptop-mode-tools, I found info on the net about that
2011-01-21T23:35:00.000Z	leachim6		so I uninstalled laptop-mode-tools, but I still can't suspend
2011-01-21T23:35:00.000Z	leachim6		anyone know ?
2011-01-21T23:37:00.000Z	leachim6		when I press the power button "Failed to suspend, Failure was reported as: Cannot Suspend", anyone know how to fix it?
2011-01-21T23:38:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	did you set your power button to suspend instead of shut down?
2011-01-21T23:39:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	yes.....I did
2011-01-21T23:41:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	usr13 , do you have any suggestions on how to fix it? I already uninstalled latop-mode-tools and I still can't suspend
2011-01-21T23:41:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	can you write a script to execute that command when the power button is pressed? i know it's a round about solution but it would work
2011-01-21T23:42:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	the power button?
2011-01-21T23:42:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	yes?
2011-01-21T23:44:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	I found the culprit, installing laptop-mode-tools removes something else, I didn't realize
2011-01-21T23:44:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	when I click the power button on the panel, I get two options "Shutdown" and "Restart"
2011-01-21T23:44:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	which package provides these functions?
2011-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	pm-utils
2011-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	but pm-utils is already installed :/
2011-01-21T23:46:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	can you sudo apt-get install suspend?
2011-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	or hibernate for that matter?
2011-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	that's not a real package name.....
2011-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	did you try?
2011-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	yes.
2011-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	leachim6	crap, maybe it's something else
2011-01-21T23:48:00.000Z	leachim6	sinisterstuf	yeah, s2ram is one
