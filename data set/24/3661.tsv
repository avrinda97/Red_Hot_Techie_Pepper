2008-01-23T16:43:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	:i can
2008-01-23T16:48:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: what's the next step?
2008-01-23T16:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	Using Nautilus > GoTo > Location > Network, can you see an entry 'Windows network'?
2008-01-23T16:50:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	:i can
2008-01-23T16:50:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: but when i click on it nothing appears
2008-01-23T16:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	Double-click on Windows network should display the shares available to you. If not I presume that your smb.conf file is wrong.
2008-01-23T16:53:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: where is the proper smb.conf file?
2008-01-23T16:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	/usr/share/samba/smb.conf
2008-01-23T16:58:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: i tried replacing the etc/samba/smb.conf with /usr/share/samba/smb.conf but still it doesnt show up
2008-01-23T17:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	I made a mistake. The file /etc/samba/smb.conf is your personal Samba configuration file. Its contents should resemble that of your friend's mutatis mutandis.
2008-01-23T17:06:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	:it is mutatis mutandis .infact i replaced it also!!!
2008-01-23T17:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	But still after rebooting Nautilus cannot see your friend's share?
2008-01-23T17:07:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	:and the worst thing is he doesnt have samba running when checked in adminstration->services and i have both samba and nfs running!!!!
2008-01-23T17:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	NFS does not matter. You either try Samba or NFS. Please do not mix them (at least not at the beginning.)
2008-01-23T17:11:00.000Z	user11_011		there is a lan and many comps are sharing
2008-01-23T17:12:00.000Z	user11_011		both windows and linux
2008-01-23T17:12:00.000Z	user11_011		are shared
2008-01-23T17:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	If he doesn't have a samba client running then he will never receive a remote file.
2008-01-23T17:13:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: its not showing in ps -aef
2008-01-23T17:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	May be you are referring to a Samba server. A Samba server may be located anywhere in a LAN, it has not to be at your firend's location.
2008-01-23T17:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	What is not shown in ps -aef?
2008-01-23T17:14:00.000Z	user11_011	bullgard4	: SAMBA
2008-01-23T17:14:00.000Z	bullgard4	user11_011	Then you better install and launch your Samba client.
