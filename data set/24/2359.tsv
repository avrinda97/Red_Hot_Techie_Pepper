2009-02-04T07:28:00.000Z	jer3my		Looks like i am not the only one with wifi issues, i have a Atheros AR242x card that for the life of me, i can not get working, have tried back ports, madwifi, ndiswrapper, and other things... not sure if i am doing something or what, Looks as if my card might be disabled... but no idea how to enable it. http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/113426/
2009-02-04T07:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	that device should work fine.. you say you've tried the backports..
2009-02-04T07:30:00.000Z	jer3my	IndyGunFreak	I doesn't, on a fresh install, did the blacklisting, disabling, rebooted, installed backports, then rebooted again and still no wifi.
2009-02-04T07:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	are you using 64bit/
2009-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	are you using 8.10, or 8.04
2009-02-04T07:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	should be unnecessary.. it works w/ a patched version of madwifi under 8.04.. but it should work just by installing the backports under Intrepid. (8.10
2009-02-04T07:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	go to system/admin/hardware drivers
2009-02-04T07:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	what is there.. "Support for Atheros 802.11 wireless lan cards"
2009-02-04T07:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	if you don't have two options there for that atheros device, you've nto followed instructions properly
2009-02-04T07:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	again, what does that option say there..
2009-02-04T07:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	you're doing something wrong... you should also have there.. "Support for 5xxxx series of Atheros 802.11 wireless LAN cards"
2009-02-04T07:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	you say you've tried the backports... what did you try
2009-02-04T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	i've tried to ask you, and you left before i had the chance
2009-02-04T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	ok, are both of them enabled, or both disabled, or what?
2009-02-04T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	i thought you said there were two, and it was disabled?
2009-02-04T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	yes
2009-02-04T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	so you installed the backports, ...and disabled support for athoers 802.11.. cards" right?
2009-02-04T08:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	open a terminal, what is the output of lsb_release -a
2009-02-04T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	i honestly don't know.. you've probably done something in your fumbling to get this working.. but those instructions you were looking at, should work perfectly
2009-02-04T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	what model is your laptop?
2009-02-04T08:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	i'm really not sure what all you've done, but those instructions should work perfectly
2009-02-04T08:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	i've got that device on 3 different laptops, not to mention i've set it up on several others.. and thats exactly what i've done (what those instructions say)
2009-02-04T08:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	that device was harder in 8.04 than in 8.10
2009-02-04T08:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jer3my	maybe you should try a shotgun...
