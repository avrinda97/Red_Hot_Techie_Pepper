2007-03-31T16:03:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	no problem
2007-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	it should do it automatically, can you open System>Preferences>Sessions ?
2007-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	just make sure there is a line that says nm-applet --sm-disable in startup programs
2007-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	great
2007-03-31T16:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	it should work now, if it ever doesn't work, all you should do is sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
2007-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	screen rotation?
2007-03-31T16:06:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	I have no experience in tablet pcs
2007-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	well im afraid i will not be able to help you on that one :S
2007-03-31T16:07:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	theres a driver called ntfs-3g
2007-03-31T16:08:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	i don't have ntfs drives, so I wouldn't know
2007-03-31T16:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	it should say how to install them
2007-03-31T16:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	yes you probably will have to compile them
2007-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	its not as difficult as you think
2007-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	actually for ntfs it doesn't look like source packages, so it should be pretty straight forward
2007-03-31T16:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	nah, it gets easy
2007-03-31T16:11:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	rod__	you don't need that
