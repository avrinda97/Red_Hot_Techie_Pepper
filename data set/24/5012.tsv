2006-11-19T09:40:00.000Z	bunnythebunny		Hey guys, how do i update my Alsa drivers?
2006-11-19T09:42:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	has to be configuration
2006-11-19T09:42:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	something must be set to mono somewhere
2006-11-19T09:43:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	well, Surround is up, LFC is up, Master is up, Center is up, PCM is up,
2006-11-19T09:44:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	it isn't anything obvious like that, or you would have found it long ago
2006-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	:(. But the thing is, i've tried a sort of ...trick...into making them all work, from gentoo wiki i think....which basically implies in making a .asoundrc file in the home directory. They all work. the only problem then is that eventually it starts making odd cracklings and the system sort of "stops" ..kinda like a scratched record.
2006-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	they all work = my speakers.
2006-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	can you put the .asound file on the paste site?  maybe that will trigger someone's memory about something
2006-11-19T10:17:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	could you do me a favor and look at this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32670/   is that how its supossed to be? i dont think my sound card is anything reelated to Intel
2006-11-19T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	looking
2006-11-19T10:18:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	aplay --list-device
2006-11-19T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	that's ok.  iec958 is a format, like mp2
2006-11-19T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	the ich is from a bus manager, I think.  I don't think that's your problem.
2006-11-19T10:19:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	ITS SO FRUSTRATING! i can't find anything wrong..........and........there's something wrong. URGH.
2006-11-19T10:20:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	indeed.  You might try running something under strace and looking for something suspicious, but that would generate thousands of lines of output and probably 5 lines would be relevant.
2006-11-19T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	I don't know who would look.
2006-11-19T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	let me think about it for a bit.
2006-11-19T10:21:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	alright
2006-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	what about rpm2cpio?
2006-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	i need to get in order to get klik working
2006-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	so install it.
2006-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	can't find it in the repositories and google isn't telling much either
2006-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	bunnythebunny	there is a package named rpm, it includes rpm2cpio
2006-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	bunnythebunny	sethk	yeah! i found that out just now! thanks anyway :)
