2010-10-30T15:02:00.000Z	alexb92		hey guys i need help upgrading to ubuntu 10.10, it keeps mentioning somethong about a dependency cycle and it locks up
2010-10-30T15:02:00.000Z	alexb92		any ideas on how to fix?
2010-10-30T15:03:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	rather do a clean install
2010-10-30T15:05:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	save all the packages for all your current programs to a CD, download Ubuntu 10.10, do clean intsall, install your apps from your CD and voila! :)
2010-10-30T15:05:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	how do i do that? haha ive already downloaded the alternate install cd, so i might give that a try maybe?
2010-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	there is an easy way and a fun way
2010-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	the easy way is to install AptOnCD
2010-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	hahahaha fun as in challenging?
2010-10-30T15:07:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	the fun way is to actually do it yourself, copy the files to a CD/usb do dpkg-scanpackages and so on, and add that directory to your sources list in the new OS
2010-10-30T15:08:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	haha nah stuff that way hahaha, cant be bothered, i actually dont even mind waiting till 11.04 to come out
2010-10-30T15:09:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	yeah i sometimes use apt-get, if i just want it done quick and fast, then update-manager is what i generally use
2010-10-30T15:09:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	thatś a long time. upgrading to 10.10 broke my computer, so I did a clean install and works fine
2010-10-30T15:11:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	local repositories are also cool when you have lots of Ubuntu machines and they need updating, then you only need to download it for 1 computer and the others can download it from that one
2010-10-30T15:12:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	so is it worth it then? i really dont have the time to be stuffing around with broken installs
2010-10-30T15:13:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	hmmm, sounds interesting, shame ive only got ubuntu installed on one computer at home, i was thinking of putting it on my netbook but i think its crammed enough as it is
2010-10-30T15:13:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	do you have a LOT of programs installed that didnt come installed with ubuntu?
2010-10-30T15:13:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	what OS is your netbook currently running?
2010-10-30T15:17:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	yes, a heck of alot over 20,000 packages from memory
2010-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	currently i have a dual boot config with windows 7 and xp home, i did try the netbook remix but i didnt really like it
2010-10-30T15:19:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	if youŕe using winXP or > then I think Xubuntu should really work much faster on your computer than windows, I think ubuntu netbook remix is possibly too oversimplified
2010-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	if you have that many packages I recommend doing a clean install and reinstalling the porgrams because a direct upgrade with so many untested packages is not gfuarunteed to work
2010-10-30T15:23:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	hmm fair enough, thanks for all the help mate :)
2010-10-30T15:24:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	alexb92	youŕe welcome, if you need help with your packages I still here
2010-10-30T15:25:00.000Z	alexb92	sinisterstuf	: cheers :D
