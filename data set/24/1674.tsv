2009-10-11T01:47:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie		I have two kernals in my grub/menu.lst that appear to be exactly the same (except for the quiet/splash parameters), can I just delete the ones that I don't want?
2009-10-11T01:47:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	yeah you can, but if you want the diagnostic boot options at boot you might want to leave the others
2009-10-11T01:49:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	diagnostic boot options?
2009-10-11T01:50:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	typically you'll have one that does single user mode, but if it's a new install they have one that goes to a recovery options menu
2009-10-11T01:51:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	i beleive using the option 'single' before the root declaration in grub does that
2009-10-11T01:52:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	can you tell me if this is set up right? these are the kernels that are listed: http://pastebin.com/d7869405c
2009-10-11T01:54:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	yeah they look fine, and that does seem like the only difference.... no quiet/splash, 2 different kernels
2009-10-11T01:55:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	should I have one that is a recovery mode or diagnostic one? like, should I delete the extras and then add one in?
2009-10-11T01:56:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	usually there is a recovery option, how did you do this install?  I notice you have a realtime kernel installed
2009-10-11T01:57:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	I updated the Juanty install that I had with the ubuntu studio packages (for audio production stuff).
2009-10-11T01:58:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	is it possible to get a recovery mode one since I don't have one?
2009-10-11T01:59:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	well, now that I've looked at mine, the only thing that the 'recovery mode' does different is add the 'single' option to the kernel line, so it seems that the menu to which I referred earlier is just implemented by ubuntu's runlevel 1
2009-10-11T02:00:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	so if you want a recovery mode option, just copy one of those and add 'dingle' to the end of the kernel line, and put something meaningful in the title
2009-10-11T02:01:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	so keep one of the copies, change the title to have (recovery mode) in it, and then add 'single' to the end of the kernel line... sounds do-able...
2009-10-11T02:01:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	yeah that will give you a 'recovery mode' option at boot
2009-10-11T02:02:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	 the 'single' goes after the 'ro' at the end of the line, right? And what exactly does that do?
2009-10-11T02:03:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	yeah, what that does is it tells the kernel to boot to single user mode
2009-10-11T02:04:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	in single user mode you don't have most things, and the only user that can access the system is root
2009-10-11T02:05:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	so it's just good for repairing stuff? I'm a little confused about it, since I've never used it, but I can just check up some more information about it in the community documentation or something.
2009-10-11T02:05:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	should I have a recovery mode for each kernal, or just one?
2009-10-11T02:07:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	yeah, you'd use it when you had problems you couldn't solve normally, mostly for broken file system problems.... and in all reality you don't even need to have an entry in your menu.list file because you can add the 'single' option at the grub boot menu at boot time
2009-10-11T02:07:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	that is to say, whether you have one for each kernel or not is purly up to you
2009-10-11T02:09:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	thedude42	thank you
2009-10-11T02:09:00.000Z	thedude42	ZoeyMarie	no prob
