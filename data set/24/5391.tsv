2006-07-27T16:52:00.000Z	AndyCooll		jentsu: Yes, when it comes to the partitioning stage of the install select manual installation
2006-07-27T16:52:00.000Z	AndyCooll		jentsu: apologies should have read ...select manually partition
2006-07-27T16:53:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	okay, thanks. Is that going to be too terribly difficult to figure out?
2006-07-27T16:53:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	manually partitioning, that is?
2006-07-27T16:54:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	Is that it?
2006-07-27T16:55:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	Thanks... That sounds much easier than I expected.
2006-07-27T16:57:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	just one further thing to mention ...you need to partitions minimum / and swap
2006-07-27T16:57:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Wish I could type! That should read "two partitions minimum"
2006-07-27T16:58:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	oh, okay. Well, since I already tried installing it but it messed up after that stage, there should already be both of those partitions, yes?
2006-07-27T05:01:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	you might try breaking that partition in to two. Or you could try dooglus's approach
2006-07-27T05:02:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	How would I split it up, as far as size distribution goes?
2006-07-27T05:03:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Well, first you delete it
2006-07-27T05:03:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Then you create a new partition.
2006-07-27T05:04:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Say the partition you delete was 10gb, you create the new one to be 9gb
2006-07-27T05:04:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	And then you create another partition and use the rest of the free space
2006-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	Jentsu	AndyCooll	so for a 50gb partition, I should split it as 45/5, or 49/1?
2006-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	They generally say create a swap partition that 1.5 to 2 times the size of your RAM
2006-07-27T05:07:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	As dli says. In my case I have 1024 so I create a 2gb swap. It could be less I know, but since I have an 80gb HDD I ain't too worried about space
2006-07-27T05:09:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	How much RAM do you have?
2006-07-27T05:13:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	The one that says "user memory"
2006-07-27T05:15:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Ok, you probably want to create a swap partition up to about 1gb then
2006-07-27T05:17:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	Have you backed up your "important" files. Just in case!
2006-07-27T05:18:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	And you might want to have a look at this website. Just a bit more background. http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/
2006-07-27T05:21:00.000Z	AndyCooll	Jentsu	You are welcome. Best of luck!
