2009-04-02T13:46:00.000Z	thefeds		how do I set it to automatically log into root?
2009-04-02T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	you don't - thats not a good idea
2009-04-02T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	the root password on ubuntu locked
2009-04-02T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	if you don't know how to unlock it I strongly advise you not to
2009-04-02T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	sudo passwd root - good luck
2009-04-02T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	thats done through the "gdm" manager, if you go into system->administration->login window you'll be able to set it
2009-04-02T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	no - it just locks it
2009-04-02T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	then run ass root
2009-04-02T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	so do it
2009-04-02T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	you can request an update,
2009-04-02T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	if you log a request through launchpad.net
2009-04-02T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	just log a request to the team that maintains it
2009-04-02T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	control your lagnauge please
2009-04-02T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	you wher etold what to do
2009-04-02T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	why are you asking again  ?
2009-04-02T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	I told you how to do auto login
2009-04-02T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	you need to use the gdm manager tool
2009-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	that's not what I said do
2009-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	it's in system->preferences and it either says login manager, or login window
2009-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	have you set the root password for root?
2009-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	thefeds	as I explaiend earlier the root password is locked by default
