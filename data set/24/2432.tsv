2009-07-12T23:05:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	does apt-get or similar report any errors with the file?
2009-07-12T23:07:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	that could be from the server too .. what's the exact error message?  pastebin it
2009-08-17T06:16:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	the preferred way is to use -exec .. xargs is usually broken unless all filenames passed to it are quoted properly
2009-08-17T06:17:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	What are the parentheses for?
2009-08-17T06:18:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	parantheses in regards to the shell or find?
2009-08-17T06:18:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	The parentheses in the exec {}
2009-08-17T06:20:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	those are curly-braces not parantheses .. find expands that notation to the filename found so it can be passed to the application properly
2009-08-17T06:21:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	for example you might want something like this.    find . -exec echo I found {} \;
2009-08-17T06:22:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	 Do I always this for example if I was passing the output to sed or something?  Couldn't I just do a find . -name "*.mp3" | sed ...........
2009-08-17T06:23:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	you could do that - but you must be careful, that construct can break if your filenames have spaces or newlines, etc in them.
2009-08-17T06:24:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	 this should help you - http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind
2009-08-17T06:24:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	So what would be the correct syntax for use with sed?
2009-08-17T06:25:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	  erm it gets complicated.    while read -r -d '' line; do sed -e '...' <<< "$line"; done < <(find . -print0)
2009-08-17T06:25:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	the link i gave you discusses some pitfalls and how to avoid them
2009-08-17T06:26:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	Im reading the page right now, but the last example you gave me -- That's crazy!
2009-08-17T06:27:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	well yea, typically for trivial scripts - you wouldn't go through the hassle - but if you want your script to work everywhere and not be prone to errors, you'd have to worry.
2009-08-17T06:34:00.000Z	kevdog	unop	That wiki went from basic to extreme really quick!!!
2009-08-29T10:03:00.000Z	unop	kevdog	you mean, you're connected to a remote screen session via SSH and want to forward X back to your client?
