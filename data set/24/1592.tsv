2010-05-11T11:10:00.000Z	tim__		I have seamonkey and it does the same thing
2010-05-11T11:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	Try this in a terminal: dig AAAA www.google.com
2010-05-11T11:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	Do you get any output?
2010-05-11T11:11:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	it worked fine
2010-05-11T11:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	ok, it's not ipv6, or a dns issue then
2010-05-11T11:14:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	ok, try this: telnet www.google.com 80 - (if it connects it will tell you, ctrl+c to excape)
2010-05-11T11:15:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	there's your problem, port 80 (possibly more) are being blocked
2010-05-11T11:16:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	can you do this: ping google.com
2010-05-11T11:17:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	how do I unblock it?  I cannot ping google.com, but I can ping my internet service provider, I am in Honduras
2010-05-11T11:18:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	try this: ping 72.14.213.147
2010-05-11T11:19:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	no
2010-05-11T11:20:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	do you know someone else near you that has Internet via the same isp, that maybe you can call and have them run similar tests - even if on windows?
2010-05-11T11:21:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	 I have a windows laptop sitting right here
2010-05-11T11:21:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	try the same tests with it (the dig tests wont work, but the others will)
2010-05-11T11:22:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	brb while you test...
2010-05-11T11:30:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	I can still ping my provider here in Honduras but no where else but have never been able to do this successfully but the internet is working without problem on the other computer and my voip phone is working great also
2010-05-11T11:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	I guess that narrows it down to the ubox...are you running any kind od firewall?
2010-05-11T11:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	can you paste the result of: sudo iptables -L  -to http://paste.ubuntu.com
2010-05-11T11:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	can you paste the result of: 'sudo iptables -L'  -to http://paste.ubuntu.com
2010-05-11T11:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	the quotes are not needed, I was just trying to clarify...
2010-05-11T11:37:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	 Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
2010-05-11T11:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	dude
2010-05-11T11:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	tim__	heh, good point - regardless, from what I saw f/w isn't the issue.
2010-05-11T11:43:00.000Z	tim__	greezmunkey	 I am burning a new install cd and going to go that route, thanks for the help!
