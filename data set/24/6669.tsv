2005-08-25T16:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	what hardware do you have? What version of ubuntu have you installed? Please give us more details
2005-08-25T16:21:00.000Z	mrttm	HappyFool	I use Hoary U5.04
2005-08-25T16:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	that is a normal network card? (i.e., ethernet)
2005-08-25T16:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	your card is not listed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWiredNetworkCards
2005-08-25T16:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	ok, so what isn't working? I'm still not really sure what your problem is
2005-08-25T16:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	how about the pci=noacpi line?
2005-08-25T16:31:00.000Z	mrttm	HappyFool	how can I reload the module of kernel
2005-08-25T16:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	try 'modprobe'
2005-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	i'm not sure exactly what you mean, though
2005-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	what module do you want to load?
2005-08-25T16:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	not at all
2005-08-25T16:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	you may want to 'blacklist' the tulip module somehow -- i'm not sure how that's done
2005-08-25T16:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	glad i could help
2005-08-25T16:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	maybe add 'tulip' to /etc/hotplug/blacklist -- i'm not sure that's right
2005-08-25T16:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	mrttm	cheers
