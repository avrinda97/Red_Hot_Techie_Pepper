2007-11-01T04:30:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	yep, you run windows in a window
2007-11-01T04:31:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	this sounds fantastic but, what about this files? libxerces27 libxalan110. Are they secure ?
2007-11-01T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	hmm, what are those files?
2007-11-01T04:32:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	Ubuntu package installers advices me that they could have malicious code. Are they safe, how can I check?
2007-11-01T04:34:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	pastebin the exact errors
2007-11-01T04:36:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	it is in my language, not english you wouldn't understand. What can I do?
2007-11-01T04:36:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	I'm installing anyway
2007-11-01T04:37:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	I understad spanish well enough
2007-11-01T04:38:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	my system is *not*  in spanish, it's basque
2007-11-01T04:39:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	ah, my mustake, just went by ip.  You can run 'LANGUAGE=en apt-cache policy PACKAGE' for the offending packages
2007-11-01T04:40:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	No problem, I just wanted to know about those warning files, anyway let me fibish installation...
2007-11-01T04:41:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	And I'm reading the license in case...
2007-11-01T04:44:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	So it says that it can only be used for a few weeks, what happens afterwards?
2007-11-01T04:45:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	erm... what package did you grab exactly?  http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads should not say that
2007-11-01T04:46:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	VirtualBox 1.5.2 for Linux Hosts: * Ubuntu 7.10 ("Gutsy Gibbon") i386 | AMD64
2007-11-01T04:47:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	I should have downloaded the OSE ?
2007-11-01T04:47:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	nope, I use the other one as well.  Where exactly are you reading this limit?
2007-11-01T04:48:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	I read the limit in the license, wich says that it's for educational purposes etc...
2007-11-01T04:48:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	oh, I see.  I guess you are technically correct, but it is up to you to decide how long you want to evaluate it
2007-11-01T04:49:00.000Z	_hopex	jrib	would there be any difference if I add the repository and install it by apt-get? How did you do that?
2007-11-01T04:50:00.000Z	jrib	_hopex	difference would be update-manager will notify you of updates about virtualbox.  Join me in #ubuntu-classroom if you want to do that and the instructions there are not clear
