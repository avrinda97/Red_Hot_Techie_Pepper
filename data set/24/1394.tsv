2011-02-21T01:18:00.000Z	FSX		The default printing GUI in Xubuntu is a bit limited. Is there an alternative?
2011-02-21T01:19:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	you mean the printer configuration? the ui in apps for printing should be the same regardless of the DE (as long as it's gtk)
2011-02-21T01:20:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	I mean the GUI you see when you print a photo for example. My parents are not happy with the default one.
2011-02-21T01:21:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	you might need to look to another app thats printing the picture and hope its changes to the dialogue suffice
2011-02-21T01:21:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	the print preview stuff is weird in firefox tho, can't do much about that
2011-02-21T01:23:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	I can say they're not nuts. ;) My mom prints a lot of photos and it's not easy enough to place multiple photos on one page without using an image editor.
2011-02-21T01:24:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	ya, that's why i'm saying you should sooner look to an app that's better at printing photos
2011-02-21T01:25:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	k
2011-02-21T01:25:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	something that lets you arrange photos on the paper or something, that's not a job for the print dialogue proper
2011-02-21T01:26:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	unfortunately the only app i know personally that does that, is picasa :\
2011-02-21T01:26:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	Ok, I'll probably try to make something myself then.
2011-02-21T01:27:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	you could install them all and let the parents pick :]
2011-02-21T01:27:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	hehe, they don't have time to try things. It just has to work. Can't do much about that.
2011-02-21T01:29:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	shotwell and f-spot are on the shortlist, but only because i don't know of any others :D
2011-02-21T01:30:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	I tried Shotwell. Printing is a bit limited.
2011-02-21T01:30:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	You can only adjust the size of the image.
2011-02-21T01:35:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	good luck, picasa is available for linux; just not in the repos
2011-02-21T01:35:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	Do you perhaps know if there's a Printing API for Python in Ubuntu?
2011-02-21T01:38:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	if there is it won't be able to do what you're looking to do
2011-02-21T01:38:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	Why not?
2011-02-21T01:39:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	the print dialogue isn't the place to arrange photos and stuff, it needs to be done by the app before that
2011-02-21T01:40:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	My mom just needs to be able to select a few photos in THunar and then print them (on one page or something else). I can make a GUI for that.
2011-02-21T01:40:00.000Z	ohsix	FSX	i suppose, but that's something different entirely :]
2011-02-21T01:41:00.000Z	FSX	ohsix	Yea ^^
