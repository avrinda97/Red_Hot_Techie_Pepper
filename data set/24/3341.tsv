2008-12-15T00:10:00.000Z	Karn	n8tuser	it doesnt have one :) it was connected over wireless but after removing network-manager it doesnt have the ra0 interface
2008-12-15T00:10:00.000Z	n8tuser		Karn-> can you not connect it using an ethernet cable? thats okay too to use ethernet,

2008-12-15T00:11:00.000Z	n8tuser		Karn-> do you recall which chip your wifi uses?
