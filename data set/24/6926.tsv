2005-06-14T14:38:00.000Z	MrDataNet		How can I turn off daemons? Things start up automatically when I boot, and I would like to turn them off, but I have no idea how. I think they're daemons. I tried an uninstall of Zope, and it is now only partially uninstalled. I think daemons are the problem? Someone put a bug note here: https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/malone/tasks/651/
2005-06-14T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	zope being broken shouldn't affect anything else.
2005-06-14T14:39:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	anyway, if your original question is "How do I stop some daemons running on boot?", just delete the S symlinks from /etc/rc2.d/
2005-06-14T14:58:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	it's how init systems work on all modern unix systems
2005-06-14T14:58:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	in ubunut/debian, the theory is that you don't install things if you don't want to run them
2005-06-14T15:30:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	this problem has nothing to do with "daemons running
2005-06-14T15:35:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	If daemons aren't the problem, then what do you think is the problem? This relates to https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/malone/tasks/651/
2005-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	good on you for finding the bug report, btw
2005-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	thanks
2005-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	it being uninstallable is presumably because the package is broken
2005-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	it won't run anymore, but it won't cause problems with you installing zope from source, either
2005-06-14T15:43:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	I believe you, and it's just on faith. Question: Could package removal of any particular package be impeeded by the program already running? I guess you're saying that Linux/Unix can do the removal with programs running? The reason I ask is that I think I saw a message from Synaptic about trying to close a daemon, but that failed because the "daemon manager" wasn't running. I don't see...
2005-06-14T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	"subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 1" is a generic error from the low-level package manegement tools (dpkg) that means the removal cleanup script screwed up somehow
2005-06-14T15:44:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	you would have got that if the zope packages are screwed
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	The package wasn't completely removed. It makes me nervous. ;> Should I remove the remaining pieces manually? Do you think it would be worth trying to reinstall, then uninstall? I don't like pieces of broken stuff lying around.
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	Maybe I just overanalyse.
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	it depends on how broken it is
2005-06-14T15:48:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	heh, I understand
2005-06-14T15:49:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	without looking carefully at the bug report, I couldn't tell you, and I don't have time, sorry
2005-06-14T15:49:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	NP.
2005-06-14T15:49:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	Thanks for your help. I'm at least pointed in the right direction.
2005-06-14T15:51:00.000Z	MrDataNet	bob2	One last question, then. Would it make any difference if I reboot? I'm asking re Synaptic Package Manager: Right now, it's in a certain state where it says nothing is broken, etc. I might want to try that reinstall, or repair, or something. But, if I reboot, can that mess me up?
2005-06-14T15:56:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	rebooting won't help or hinder
2005-06-14T15:56:00.000Z	bob2	MrDataNet	unless the problem was to do with zope running or something weird
