2007-12-05T01:36:00.000Z	jk__		dude: yea
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	jk__		dude: your boot loader will work as usual, but just with ubuntu instead of slackware
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	jk__		dude: personally, i wouldn't set up a dual boot if you paid me . . .
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	jk__		dude: vmware is too good
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	jk__		dude: yes, you have to make sure your boot loader is happy
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	jk__		dude: personally, i do a lot of development, and i run ubuntu with many vmware vm's
2007-12-05T01:39:00.000Z	jk__		dude: dual boot is too much a headache.
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	jk__		dude: vmware: emulator. you'll be much happier, trust me. abandone dual booting
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	jk__		dude: if i were you, i'd back everything up, install ubuntu on the whole machine
2007-12-05T01:40:00.000Z	jk__		dude: then i'd install vmare (free) and run windows in a virtual machine
2007-12-05T01:41:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Install virtualbox instead
2007-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Virtualbox is almost like vmware, but free, and very decent
2007-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	It behaves and looks similar to vmware that is
2007-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Well, it is opensource aswell :P
2007-12-05T01:42:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Virtualbox
2007-12-05T01:43:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	And virtualbox runs also on windows
2007-12-05T01:43:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	I use it a lot on both windows and linux machines
2007-12-05T01:52:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Hmm, in some senses it seems to be slower, atleast last time I benchmarked it, year ago
2007-12-05T01:52:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	But it has developed much since then
2007-12-05T01:54:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	http://www.linux-gamers.net/smartsection.item.56/virtualbox-vs-qemu.html
2007-12-05T01:54:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Some benchmark, seems vbox is better than vmware
2007-12-05T01:55:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Not when using kernel drivers
2007-12-05T01:56:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	Anyways I have had no problems with perfomance on virtualbox
2007-12-05T01:57:00.000Z	Suva	jk__	And last time I used linux guest on win machine on vmware I replaced it with vbox because vmware was much slower and didn't want to install guest additions
