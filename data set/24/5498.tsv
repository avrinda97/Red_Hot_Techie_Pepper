2006-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	but gparted can't change your current partition mounted on /
2006-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	Hence the link to the CD :)
2006-06-24T10:39:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	knoppix livecd won't work for this purpose?
2006-06-24T10:40:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	KNOPPIX is 700MB, GParted disc is about 30MB
2006-06-24T10:41:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	oh! that's brilliant! a separate cd for it so you won't have to worry about having anything mounted!
2006-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	I always feel horrible about burning 30mb to a 700mb cd...
2006-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	As long as they don't put an automounter at boot...
2006-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	CDRW is your friend
2006-06-24T10:42:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	oh?
2006-06-24T10:43:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	yes
2006-06-24T10:43:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	As long as it's type can be resized
2006-06-24T10:44:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	Ext3 can be resized (I have never done it in a GUI, but I have done it with fstab and parted in CLI)
2006-08-01T13:49:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	Synaptic
2006-08-01T13:50:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	It will take out the main openoffice meta-package, but the others should remain. If not then use aptitude to get a little more control
2006-08-01T13:53:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	Yes, but it you may be in a situation where the openoffice package is the only one installed "manually". In that case when you remove oodraw, which will then remove openoffice, it may say it is removing the rest (like oowrite) sicne they are "no longer used" (ie. they only existed because openoffice was installed) if that is the case then aptitude lets you fine tune your changes before you apply them
2006-08-01T13:55:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	OODraw is really bad :)
2006-08-08T15:55:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	I am trying to break my addiction (well, diverge it on to Listen)
2006-10-17T10:25:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	Z sessions are in /usr/share somewhere I think (I found them by opening up a package which contained a new .desktop profile)
2006-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	i do have a fluxbox.desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions, but everywhere it says /usr/bin/startfluxbox... so i dont see why it continues to run the executable  fluxbox instead
2006-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	Warbo	azureal	That is a text file, open it up in gksudo gedit and change the command it runs
2006-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	lol, i'
2006-10-17T10:29:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	i'm trying to tell you that the file already looks correct
2006-10-17T10:31:00.000Z	azureal	Warbo	oh, i'm going to try putting my startup commands + programs in /usr/bin/startfluxbox rather than ~/.fluxbox/startup...
