2009-02-12T08:29:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	And you haven't made any drastic changes after the install? Meaning, the wubi install is still intact?
2009-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	no changes, it worked perfectly before i left for my trip, today my gf was trying to print something and i walked her though some things, had her boot to windows to print .. she left it in windows, says nothing strange happened, i come home and its in initramfs ...i reboot same thing, i go to windows and it says it recovered from a severe error
2009-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Does it always say recovered from a serious error? Did you try doing a diskcheck?
2009-02-12T08:32:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	since i got back, i've only booted into windows once ... so its only said it once, i wouldnt expect it to say it again but i havent tryed
2009-02-12T08:33:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	A diskcheck from Windows wouldn't hurt a little bit
2009-02-12T08:35:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	k
2009-02-12T08:38:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	diskcheck complete, (i did not check the box to scan for and atempt to repair bad sectors ... that takes hours?) but the normal check passed fine
2009-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Yeah, that should be fine. So, the thing is it goes into initramfs recovery... there are a few threads on ubuntuforums but nothing too substaincial
2009-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	in grub's menu there is a recovery option .... i chose to try to boot to windows before i tryed that, so i didnt try it ... what does that do, is it worth a try?
2009-02-12T08:40:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	most of my data, from in ubuntu, or windows, i stored to other partitions ... so if i lost this and had to start over it wouldnt kill me, however it would be very inconvient ...
2009-02-12T08:41:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Yeah I get it. Although it is a really weird bug, let me see if google can kelp
2009-02-12T08:41:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	good luck, i tryed google but didnt notice anything to useful ...
2009-02-12T08:45:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	when i put the ubuntu dvd into windows now it gives 3 options, first is 'demo and full instal' which reads to reboot the system, boot to cd, and you can demo, instal ubuntu alongside windows, or as the only OS ... 2nd option (probably what i tryed last time to get the setup i now have which worked for a few months untill now) is 'install inside windows' which reads to instal and uninstal ubuntu like any other application,
2009-02-12T08:45:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Yeah, that is wubi. It relies of some parts of Windows to run properly
2009-02-12T08:46:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	I would say, go for a full install if you really want Ubuntu as a full fledge OS
2009-02-12T08:46:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	i would much rather we figure out how to save my past instlation beings i cant go in there and back anything up (such as my email) .. but if i chose option 1, and instal it alongside windows ... how does that work? how is it different?
2009-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	It should create a proper partition, and then let you install it as a separate partition, rather than running it inside the windows partition
2009-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	i'm working on geting so i dont depend on windows, but i still depend on it slightly ... and would like both OS's .... i COULD instal windows in a VM i understand after doing ubuntu first but that cuts resources right?
2009-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Could you try a Chkdsk /r on the main boot parition
2009-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	trying
2009-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	As long as you are not running a game inside a VM, you should be fine
2009-02-12T08:49:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	says 'chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by anouther process. ... i can scedual it to do it on a reboot?
2009-02-12T08:49:00.000Z	mib_lkgyn7	Logikos	Yes please
2009-02-12T08:51:00.000Z	Logikos	mib_lkgyn7	k, i'll reboot and do that russ: i'll check your responce when i get back
