2009-02-24T21:41:00.000Z	shadeslayer		yeah
2009-02-24T21:41:00.000Z	shadeslayer		!screenlet
2009-02-24T21:41:00.000Z	shadeslayer		i have the targz file
2009-02-24T21:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	you shouldn't try to install from source in ubuntu
2009-02-24T21:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	unless its for learnin purposes, then I would recommend something easier anyways
2009-02-24T21:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	ah, that should be a drag and drop somewhere
2009-02-24T21:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	atleast gnome themese are drag and drop
2009-05-22T12:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	if you could, it wouldn't be able to scan things such as registry keys
2009-05-22T12:05:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	which is why you would typically scan from safe mode, if you can't even get in to safe mode, reformat
2009-05-22T12:06:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	you can see #windows for more info
2009-05-22T12:07:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Titan8990	cant it be done via samba?? registry keys are not a problem
2009-05-22T12:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	are you sure they are not a problem?? thats where malware keeps a lot of its bad stuff
2009-05-22T12:08:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Titan8990	yeah...ill be scanning the system with avast and then via ubuntu...just to make double sure
2009-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	i really have to say.... cleaning an infected windows machine from ubuntu is not very effective
2009-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	those A/Vs are primarly used to scan files BEFORE sending them to windows clients
2009-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	email and file server
2009-05-22T12:10:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Titan8990	ok,got your point...but some of the viruses detected by ubuntu were not detected by avast on windows
2009-05-22T12:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	shadeslayer	malwarebytes anti-malware has been by far the most effective tool for me
2009-05-22T12:11:00.000Z	shadeslayer	Titan8990	ill keep that in mind
