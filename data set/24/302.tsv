2011-12-31T19:10:00.000Z	Adrian_		Hi guys according to forums I have just been reading can someone confirm if I can't turn my ssd sata to ahci can I not install ubuntu to my ssd?
2011-12-31T19:12:00.000Z	Adrian_		Anybody had any trouble installing ubuntu to an ssd
2011-12-31T19:14:00.000Z	Adrian_		anybody good with ssd installaion
2011-12-31T19:14:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	It's the same as normal, why?
2011-12-31T19:15:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	Only to save space you might want to put the /home partition on a harddrive
2011-12-31T19:15:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	cant recognize the disk size or format!! Only thing I can think of is to try and preformat the ssd to ext4 in win 7
2011-12-31T19:16:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	You could try that with the ubuntu livecd with the program gparted. Is ahci on in the bios?
2011-12-31T19:17:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	have been trying to do that but have not had any luck yet, gparted cant help tried live boot and in windows. don't think I have ahci capability. this is a new build and I neglected to check that detail, don't want to put an old disk in either if I can avoid it.
2011-12-31T19:18:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	hmm.. I don't really know then. My ssd was just supported like a normal harddrive
2011-12-31T19:19:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	all data is on a nas so have 90gb force for dual boot os win7 and thought I might play with new ubuntu distro as haven't dual booted for a while and looks good.
2011-12-31T19:19:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	What happens if you shrink the windows partition in Windows? Then you'll have unused space where you might be able to install Ubuntu
2011-12-31T19:20:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	have 35gb raw waiting but ubuntu wont play ball. I assume ahci would be mentioned in mb spec or manual and it isn't?
2011-12-31T19:20:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	You can't find it in bios either?
2011-12-31T19:20:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	It's mostly called sata mode: ide or ahci
2011-12-31T19:23:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	Ok, what type of mb do you have?
2011-12-31T19:24:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	no set windows with 60gb and planned to use remaining 30gb for ubuntu.
2011-12-31T19:24:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	you're adressing the wrong guy, but what kind of motherboard do you have?
2011-12-31T19:25:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	mb is gigabyte m68mt-s2p, sorry sirajperson.
2011-12-31T19:26:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	Looks like your motherboard uses a special NVIDIA driver for ahci
2011-12-31T19:27:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	Don't know if that's the problem btw
2011-12-31T19:29:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	good luck
2011-12-31T19:41:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	no joy it seems nothing in bios menu mentions ahci? anybody have any solutions?
2011-12-31T19:43:00.000Z	yeehaw	Adrian_	Dina: gtg, sorry
2011-12-31T19:43:00.000Z	Adrian_	yeehaw	thanks
