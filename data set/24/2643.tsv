2008-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		So, no one has any idea what I messed up?
2008-10-15T08:21:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	when all else fails, try google?
2009-07-30T07:34:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	what do you plan to do with the iso?
2009-07-30T07:35:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	mount it, extract the files and then create a customized live CD
2009-07-30T07:36:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	yes you can...
2009-07-30T07:38:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	actually hold up, I need to get it onto a squashfs file
2009-07-30T07:39:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	not sure I can help you with that. There are howtos for remastering ubuntu cds tho'...
2009-07-30T07:40:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	thats why i was tryin to figure out how to get it to the .iso image cause the instructions call for that
2009-07-30T07:40:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	we can make an iso if you want....
2009-07-30T07:41:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	I already have the CD in the drive and dl'd on the other comp
2009-07-30T07:42:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	well, let me know when you have an actual question :-)
2009-07-30T07:42:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	so do you know of a way to just to make the .iso file from the actual CD?
2009-07-30T07:43:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	yes, wait a mo while I peek in my shell script
2009-07-30T07:45:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	first, run isoinfo -d -i /dev/cdrom and note down the number where it says 'volume size is: nnnnnnn'
2009-07-30T07:46:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	then run dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 count=<nnnnnnn> conv=notrunc > mycd.iso
2009-07-30T07:50:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	did you get what you need?
2009-07-30T07:51:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	sorry, had to go downstairs for a sec
2009-07-30T07:55:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	do you have what you need?
2009-07-30T08:01:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	thanks
2009-07-30T08:01:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	glad it worked. Your problems are just beginning...:-)
2009-07-30T08:01:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	hahahaha
2009-07-30T08:03:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	people do it, (though I'm far too lazy myself)...
2009-07-30T08:04:00.000Z	losher	GodfatherofEire	for work, presumably...
2009-07-30T08:05:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	losher	well, yeah, thats what I was gonna use it for, but still, thatd be a pain in any event
