2005-12-17T15:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Anyone have experience burning audio CDs directly from MP3?
2005-12-17T15:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I'm wondering which apps can do it.
2005-12-17T15:59:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	gnomebaker is good
2005-12-17T15:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	If I just tell it that I'm making and audio CD and add mp3 files to the list, will it figure it out from there?
2005-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	you just drag and drop the mp3s and it will make it
2005-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Perfect.
2005-12-17T16:00:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	just make sure you click on Audio Disk tab
2005-12-17T16:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Right.
2005-12-17T16:01:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	if you need to install it the command is sudo apt-get install gnomebaker
2005-12-17T16:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Already done.
2005-12-17T16:02:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	ok cool
2005-12-17T16:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Any idea why Gnomebaker would want me to be root to burn a CD?
2005-12-17T16:04:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	it shouldn't unless there may be files that are owned by root?
2005-12-17T16:04:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	i dont have to run as root or sudo...
2005-12-17T16:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	& Madpilot: No files belonging to root.  Maybe I need to add an entry to sudoers or some other permissions config to access burning capability?
2005-12-17T16:06:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	is this the default user you made with ubuntu installation?
2005-12-17T16:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Yes.
2005-12-17T16:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Yes?
2005-12-17T16:08:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	i have all ticked except use tape drive and setup and recieve faxes
2005-12-17T16:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Same.
2005-12-17T16:09:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	I don't know what's up then
2005-12-17T16:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	All right.
2005-12-17T16:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	_Gray_	Why is Gnomebaker trying to reference mplayer, totem, and java plugins on startup?
2005-12-17T16:12:00.000Z	_Gray_	tonyyarusso	No idea sorry
