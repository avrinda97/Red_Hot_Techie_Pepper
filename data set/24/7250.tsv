2005-03-01T09:49:00.000Z	chutwig		friends, is there by any chance an area where hoary ISOs are built on a scheduled basis for testing?
2005-03-01T09:49:00.000Z	chutwig		sort of like how debian testing gets new CD sets built each week
2005-03-01T09:50:00.000Z	chutwig		ah
2005-03-01T09:51:00.000Z	chutwig		so i guess hoary hasn't got any snapshot images built, then
2005-03-01T09:51:00.000Z	chutwig		;_;
2005-03-01T09:52:00.000Z	chutwig		debian is pissing me off
2005-03-01T09:53:00.000Z	chutwig		debian does not play nice with any computer that uses SATA
2005-03-01T09:54:00.000Z	chutwig		incidentally, does anyone have any experience using non-standard resolutions with a radeon
2005-03-01T09:55:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	like what non standard
2005-03-01T09:55:00.000Z	chutwig		the last computer had an i915, which wouldn't do 1680x1050 because xorg didn't know how to set the video BIOS mode
2005-03-01T09:55:00.000Z	chutwig		if this radeon has the same problem i will be upset and may have to reinstall windows :(
2005-03-01T09:55:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	1680x1050 thats a pretty non standard resolution :-)
2005-03-01T09:56:00.000Z	chutwig		meh, it's a dell 2005fpw
2005-03-01T09:56:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	well have you edited your xorg.conf
2005-03-01T09:56:00.000Z	chutwig	Codyman	i haven't even touched that computer yet, i'm at work right now using their bandwidth to get the daily hoary image
2005-03-01T09:57:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	so do you have hoary installed, or the warty one
2005-03-01T09:57:00.000Z	chutwig	Codyman	there's nothing installed yet
2005-03-01T09:57:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	o in that case it should work.. you just need to install hoary and edit the xorg.conf.. as long as your monitor supports that
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	chutwig	Codyman	i'm just concerned about the xorg module for the card also not supporting it
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	chutwig		but if ATI were the ones who did it it ought to work
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	chutwig		guess i'll find out when i get home from work
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	chutwig		nothing like babysitting a bunch of windows XP upgrades all day long
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	Codyman	chutwig	i have an ATI Radeon 9200 PCI card even and i'm using custom resolutions as well
2005-03-01T09:58:00.000Z	chutwig	Codyman	that's good news
