2006-01-03T17:39:00.000Z	nekostar		how hard is it to get ubuntu to work on a laptop?
2006-01-03T17:39:00.000Z	nekostar		a dell insperion 4000 to be exact
2006-01-03T17:40:00.000Z	nekostar		its only a celeron 600MHz 128MB ram
2006-01-03T17:40:00.000Z	nekostar		5 gig hdd :/
2006-01-03T17:40:00.000Z	nekostar		but i was thinking of using it as a portable media player frankly hehe
2006-01-03T17:42:00.000Z	nekostar		i know dells have problem on some distros so i was wondering about ubuntu :)
2006-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	nekostar		ok
2006-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	nekostar		its also not connected to the inet so its a fully offline install....
2006-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	nekostar		how small a swap can i use for 128MB ram.. say 256MB ?
2006-01-03T17:44:00.000Z	nekostar		and how small an install can i do with server install + openbox + totem-xine + codecs
2006-01-03T17:44:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	If you don't run X, you can even have no swap whatsoever.
2006-01-03T17:44:00.000Z	nekostar	cafuego	its for watching anime on the go basically :P:
2006-01-03T17:45:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	128Mb swap *minimum* but 256 is probably a better bet.
2006-01-04T13:59:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	'Dell' is a large clue. ;-)
2006-01-04T13:59:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	Anything logged on terminals 2 through 4?
2006-01-04T14:00:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	I have a 500MHz celeron 128Mb dell craptop, I can mock them if I want to! :-)
2006-01-04T14:00:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	THough I must admit that when in the dock it makes a fantabulous Edubuntu LTSP client.
2006-01-04T14:01:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	The joy of admins worldwide :-)
2006-01-04T14:04:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	Is there a pcmcia card plugged in?
2006-01-09T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	Doesn't mplayer do that?
2006-01-09T11:22:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	plays fine on my ipod
2006-01-09T11:26:00.000Z	nekostar	cafuego	we are not talking about an ipod
2006-01-09T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	I thought we were talking about playing h.264 media?
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	cafuego	nekostar	Yeah, mplayer has no issues playing x264 video.
