2012-04-28T17:35:00.000Z	zoopp		I just did a fresh install of 12.04 LTS and all went ok however after updating packages the system hangs on boot. Anyone else experiencing this?
2012-04-28T17:37:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	any output what went wrong?
2012-04-28T17:37:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	does alt-ctrl-f1 work?
2012-04-28T17:37:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	everything update correctly..I did however notice it hangs after Apparmor starts.
2012-04-28T17:38:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	I did not try however I was able to get down to root shell by using recovery mode.
2012-04-28T17:38:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	ok, but this will not help solving the problem
2012-04-28T17:39:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	what should I do in order to solve it?
2012-04-28T17:40:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	you should try boot again in normal mode and try to get a shell, if you are not able to get a shell, then I would try disabling appamor
2012-04-28T17:40:00.000Z	resmo		in recovery mode
2012-04-28T17:42:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	hmm, but there's an [OK] thingie after the apparmor entry in the boot process..it just hangs after that. I don't think it's Apparmor.
2012-04-28T17:42:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	ok, i see... did you wait for a while?
2012-04-28T17:43:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	did you have internet connectivity?
2012-04-28T17:43:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	for about 30 minutes. The HDD led was blinking from time to time.
2012-04-28T17:43:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	it did get past the network initialization I think.
2012-04-28T17:44:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	try reboot and press ctrl-d or ctrl-c if it hangs again at that point
2012-04-28T17:45:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	I did press it. Nothing happened.
2012-04-28T17:46:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	ctrl-alt-f1?
2012-04-28T17:46:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	I'll try it. But what should I if it works?
2012-04-28T17:46:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	login and dmesg
2012-04-28T17:47:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	ok. I'll try it now.
2012-04-28T17:47:00.000Z	resmo	zoopp	do you have an ssd?
2012-04-28T17:47:00.000Z	zoopp	resmo	no I don't.
