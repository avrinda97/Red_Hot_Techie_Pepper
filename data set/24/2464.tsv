2009-06-24T13:00:00.000Z	papul		whats the current kernel version for ubuntu
2009-06-24T13:01:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	2.6.28 with a shedload of special patches
2009-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	for example?
2009-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	perl
2009-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	and you don't want perl to ever be installed?
2009-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	yes
2009-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	..why?
2009-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	i am not a developer
2009-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	yes, but perl is needed to run some other application
2009-06-24T13:12:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	i just gave an example
2009-06-24T13:13:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	yes, I have no idea how to do what you want. As for not installing perl seems a bit silly
2010-01-24T15:49:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	what are you trying to compile?
2010-01-24T15:50:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	midori
2010-01-24T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	you are aware that midori is in the repositories right?
2010-01-24T15:50:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	yes
2010-01-24T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	any reason you aren't using that version?
2010-01-24T15:51:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	????
2010-01-24T15:51:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	i want to compile
2010-01-24T15:51:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	okay, but why?
2010-01-24T15:51:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	my wish. :P will you help?
2010-01-24T15:52:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	sure, okay well you haven't installed the dependencies for that package. You can install the dependencies by doing sudo apt-get build-dep midori as midori is already in the repository
2010-01-24T15:52:00.000Z	ziroday	papul	do you understand?
2010-01-24T15:53:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	thanks
2010-01-24T15:54:00.000Z	papul	ziroday	didnt knew the command apt-get build-dep existed
