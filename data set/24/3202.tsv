2010-02-06T04:47:00.000Z	mlissner		Anybody know how to make an nvidia geforce 8600 gs work? When I put it in the machine, the machine just gives me a blank screen upon boot.
2010-02-06T04:48:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	you may have to disable the onboard video in the bios first
2010-02-06T04:51:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	I think I did that, I'll double check, but you're right that I have onboard video.
2010-02-06T04:55:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	is the onboard video the serial Port1 address or the parallel port address? I don't see anything that resembles video aside from those.
2010-02-06T04:56:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	its neither. If its a newer mobo it may do it automatically. My suggestion is more an oldschool fix.
2010-02-06T04:58:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	darn...any other thoughts then? I can't get the thing to boot if the nvidea card is in the pci slot.
2010-02-06T04:58:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	wait...what kind of card is it? agp/pci or pcie?
2010-02-06T04:59:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	pcie
2010-02-06T05:00:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	I do have a setting called "Init Display First" which can be set to either 'pci' or 'pci express card'. No idea what it means though.
2010-02-06T05:00:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	sounds like a hardware prob for sure if its black from the moment you hit the power button
2010-02-06T05:00:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	thats what you need to do...
2010-02-06T05:00:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	set it to pci express card
2010-02-06T05:04:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	I put in that setting, then put in the card, but I still can't get anything to come up on the display.
2010-02-06T05:04:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	your not putting the card in with the power on right?
2010-02-06T05:04:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	Right-o
2010-02-06T05:05:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	that's a correct - I'm powering off before adding/removing any hardware.
2010-02-06T05:06:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	does that card require power? newer cards actualy require power from the powersupply, plugged directly onto it
2010-02-06T05:10:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	interesting theory...you had me worried for a second, but no, no power needed.
2010-02-06T05:12:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	silly question, but you do have the monitor securly plugged in to the card, not the onboard
2010-02-06T05:13:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	yep.
2010-02-06T05:13:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	tried both though...neither works when the nvidia card is plugged in.
2010-02-06T05:14:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	wow, hmm, ive got no idea. you may have to go to another forum, nvidia forums or something. Could be faulty hardware. or a simple bios setting ive long forgotten
2010-02-06T05:17:00.000Z	mlissner	terminhell	Oh well, thanks anyway. Good to have a second opinion.
2010-02-06T05:17:00.000Z	terminhell	mlissner	no prob. good luck!
