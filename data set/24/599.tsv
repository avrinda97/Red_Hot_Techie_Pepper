2011-05-13T00:15:00.000Z	lolnet		Can anyone help me?
2011-05-13T00:15:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	You should be more specific
2011-05-13T00:17:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	Do you have a wireless card?
2011-05-13T00:18:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	I believe it's built into the laptop. Not a separate card or anything.
2011-05-13T00:19:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	Alright, but you've used wireless with that computer before and there hasn't been any change to the hardware?
2011-05-13T00:19:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	No change, it was working earlier today on 10.04.
2011-05-13T00:19:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	And you did an upgrade?
2011-05-13T00:19:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	No, did a netinstall of 11.04.
2011-05-13T00:33:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	sudo apt-get install pysdm
2011-05-13T00:33:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	Yeah, that's not part of 11.04 through
2011-05-13T00:34:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	I'm pretty sure it is.
2011-05-13T00:35:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	It's definitely not if I have to install it
2011-05-13T00:35:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	My 11.04 install suggests it when I type it in terminal...
2011-05-13T00:36:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	It will probably do the same for oowriter... but Open Office was removed from 11.04. Just because you can download and install it via 11.04 doesn't make it included
2011-05-13T00:37:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	Why are you so averse to installing programs?
2011-05-13T00:37:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	I'm not. But my question wasn't about installing programs
2011-05-13T00:38:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	Well, it looks like you might have to.
2011-05-13T00:39:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	I'd try to jump to fewer conclusions if I were you
2011-05-13T00:43:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	I'm saying what I'm saying to try to emphasise that Ubuntu isn't some perfect system with options that cover all the bases. You often have to suppliment the basic desktop install with other programs. Ubuntu do even rip features right out.
2011-05-13T00:44:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	So, if you can't find the option with some searching through the GUI, and Google yields nothing, then you're probably at a dead end.
2011-05-13T00:44:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	And I wasn't saying anything. I only asked a question asking if a particular feature was included with 11.04. That is all.
2011-05-13T00:45:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	Just because it's not doesn't mean I have to install something or need an opinion on the matter.
2011-05-13T00:49:00.000Z	lolnet	fructose	The opinion was an offer of help in case you had the wrong idea.
2011-05-13T00:49:00.000Z	fructose	lolnet	Fine, but I take exception to my need or idea being assumed and then being told I 'had' to do things
