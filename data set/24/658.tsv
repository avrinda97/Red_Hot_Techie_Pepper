2011-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	dusf_		there was a powercut last night and because my computer shut down unexpectedly i cannot login. after i enter my password the screen goes black and then asks for the password again. this happened before and was resolved by deleting some file. i had thought rm ~/.cache/sessions/* would do it but it didn't help. can anyone suggest something that might?
2011-11-30T18:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 make a new user. see if it works for them. as a test
2011-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	i don't know how to do that from the command line, and as i've said a file just needs to be deleted like last time
2011-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 ive never seen a issue like that caused by a cache/session file.
2011-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 so its possiuble you are going about it the wrong way
2011-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 try selecting a differnt session at the login screen perhaps.
2011-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	i am certain some file just needed to be deleted last time, i remember because in the end it was so simple
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 perhjaps its .dmrc
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	switching sessions often breaks ubuntu
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	.dmrc?
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 Hmm.. no it shouldent break ubuntu.
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	my bad, *my xubuntu
2011-11-30T18:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 the light dm login screen. the little gear icon should let you select other login sessions.
2011-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	it's very similar
2011-11-30T18:47:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	where can i find this .dmrc file to delete?
2011-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 right in the users home dir..
2011-11-30T18:48:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	ty writing it down
2011-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	sudo rmdir /.dmrc or rm /.dmrc/* ?
2011-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 its a file.. and its not /* anything... it would be in your HOME directory.
2011-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	sorry, i thought . before a file meant it was an invisible dir
2011-11-30T18:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	dusf_	 its a hidden file....
2011-11-30T18:50:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	i'm going to post on forums (while logged into windows), and then try deleting dmrc, thanks for the help
2011-11-30T19:29:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	rm ~/.dmrc didn't help, thanks though
2011-11-30T19:29:00.000Z	dusf_	dr_willis	do you think this problem is specific to xubuntu/xfce and i should be asking in their support channels instead?
