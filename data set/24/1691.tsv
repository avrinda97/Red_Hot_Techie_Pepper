2009-10-29T06:58:00.000Z	mattgyver		Does anybody know how to remedy 'stuck keys' in VNC?
2009-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	I don't think I've ever had a 'stuck key' in vnc. What exactly do you mean?
2009-10-29T06:59:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	when i connect in and start typing sometimes a button will just repeat as if someone were holding down the key ,the only way to fix it is to reboot the box ;x
2009-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	I've never seen that failure mode. You're sure the physical keyboard isn't faulty?
2009-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	no i have had it happen on other machines too
2009-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	its the damndest thing and a pain in the butt too.
2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	I can imagine. Whose client and server do you use?
2009-10-29T07:06:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	its x11vnc, which i might have this wrong but i believe it still is tightvnc
2009-10-29T07:06:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	x11vnc just ensures that it loads as soon as X loads
2009-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	Interesting: Sounds like this, no? http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=180868
2009-10-29T07:14:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	funny, a user even writes this issue only happens when VNC server is configured as a service, which is what ive done
2009-10-29T07:15:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	that would explain why I've never seen it in decades of vnc use...
2009-10-29T07:15:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	yeah, its really wierd and annoying.  Especially when your in the middle of something important
2009-10-29T07:16:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	looks like this bug's been there for a while. Can you work around it?
2009-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	well if restarting the box via ssh is a work around then yes :)
2009-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	well, I was thinking more not running it as a service (not sure what that means. You mean it starts from xinetd?)
2009-10-29T07:18:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	yes
2009-10-29T07:18:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	it allows me to login from the GDM
2009-10-29T07:19:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	what about a kludgy workaround, e.g. can you ssh in and start x11vncserver by hand
2009-10-29T07:19:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	id be more apt to figure out how to, i dont know if its possible, but disconnect the keyboard and reconnect it somehow
2009-10-29T07:20:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	the postings said something about a newer server version being fixed? Maybe you need to download and build the latest server and use it instead?
2009-10-29T07:21:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	ill have to do that.  I also read that there is a key fix or soemthing, some option you can run it with
2009-10-29T07:22:00.000Z	mattgyver	losha	well back to the grind, thanks for your suggestions man, your the man
2009-10-29T07:22:00.000Z	losha	mattgyver	:-)
