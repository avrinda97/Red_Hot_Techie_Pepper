2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		Er
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		You got an IP and can't hit anything
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		That's bad
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		And kinda weird
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		Try dhclient
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		+sudo
2007-04-29T11:04:00.000Z	poje		sudo dhclient
2007-04-29T11:05:00.000Z	poje		Try it one more time
2007-04-29T11:05:00.000Z	poje		k
2007-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	PMantis	poje	He REALLY needs to stay in Ubuntu, with another computer in IRC to get help...
2007-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	poje	PMantis	that would help a lot
2007-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	poje		I know his pain though
2007-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	poje		I was fortunate for feisty that I knew what I was doing from last time + the help file
2007-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	PMantis	poje	I wonder if iptables is in the way somehow...
2007-04-29T11:07:00.000Z	poje		Since my laptop is elsewhere and the other machine is at the other end of the house
2007-04-29T11:07:00.000Z	poje		It's possible but unliekly
2007-04-29T11:07:00.000Z	poje		If he has an IP but no data transfer my first thought would be bad drivers
2007-04-29T11:07:00.000Z	poje		Or another (non-functioning) default driver binding to the device as well
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	poje		Had that happen to me in edgy
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	PMantis	poje	I don't understand what else would allow UDP port 68 & 67, but nothing after that...
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	poje	PMantis	oh, he was getting transfer?
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	poje		I definitely missed that
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	poje		I feel bad for telling him to try dhclient again :(
2007-04-29T11:08:00.000Z	PMantis	poje	to get an IP via DHCP, you have to have UDP broadcasts working...
