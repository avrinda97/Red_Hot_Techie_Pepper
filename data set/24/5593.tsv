2009-10-31T22:40:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	strange, i could mount the share manually
2009-10-31T22:41:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	try to use the IP adress instead of pc name
2009-10-31T22:42:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	did work for me: sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.198/hsr
2009-10-31T22:44:00.000Z	XVampireX	bohne	what's the cifs thing?
2009-10-31T22:44:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	i think the protocol, newer version of smbfs
2009-10-31T22:45:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.198/hsr /mnt/winshare -o username=USER,password=PASSWORD,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=077

2009-10-31T22:48:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	hm.. ? DFS root?
2009-10-31T22:48:00.000Z	XVampireX	bohne	no idea, I copied your line and changed the ip >_<
2009-10-31T22:50:00.000Z	bohne	XVampireX	you should change user and password, and also the target directory for the mount, create a new one for that
