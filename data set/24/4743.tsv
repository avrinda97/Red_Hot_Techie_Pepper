2007-06-14T12:29:00.000Z	nixnoob		why does the low latency kernel break everything?
2007-06-14T12:30:00.000Z	nixnoob		the lowlatency kernel broke my video my mouse and my wifi...
2007-06-14T12:32:00.000Z	nixnoob		mine works...
2007-06-14T12:33:00.000Z	nixnoob		why does the lowlatency kernel break my mouse?
2007-06-14T12:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	I don't think that a low latency kernel would break a mouse... there's probably a different culprit
2007-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	nixnoob		hendrisxski my old kernel works fine....
2007-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	nixnoob		hendrisxski it broke my beryl and my wifi too...
2007-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	the beryl I can believe
2007-06-14T12:35:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	will you be doing audio editing?  if not then just uninstall it
2007-06-14T12:35:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	I plan on hosting a game server...
2007-06-14T12:35:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	I need a 1000hz kernel...
2007-06-14T12:36:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	loading my old kernel fixes all the issues...
2007-06-14T12:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	hhmmm... Beryl on a server... hhhmmmm  if you want peak performance then don't even install a GUI
2007-06-14T12:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	umm... there's also another kernel for servers  I think it has the same latency... can't remember the name
2007-06-14T12:36:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	I would not be using beryl on the session but the mouse problem makes it difficult to operate
2007-06-14T12:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	oh... so it won't be a dedicated game server... you'll use it as a regular desktop as well?
2007-06-14T12:38:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	there's also a server type kernel... forgot the name, something like big iron or something... but I think it also has lower latency... also can handle bigger addressing if you have a lot of RAM
2007-06-14T12:38:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	no no I would simply switch sessions if i wanted it to run the server... and just not use the desktop environment
2007-06-14T12:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	 oh... in that case... you could just have it load the lowlatency kernel only when you want to use it as a server?  or dual boot it?
2007-06-14T12:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	those are my best suggestions.   kernel issues are kind of hard to tinker with.  I usualy just work my way around them.
2007-06-14T12:40:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	well yea thats the idea but it doesnt solve the mouse problem...
2007-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	nixnoob	I don't know then... like I said usually I just work my way around it
2007-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	hendrixski		Why can't APT my dchroot connect to archive.ubuntu.com when my regular environment has no problem with it?
2007-06-14T12:41:00.000Z	nixnoob	hendrixski	I'm going to try the old of the two lowlatency kernels.. maybe ill get lucky.
