2004-11-05T11:58:00.000Z	bern		hey all
2004-11-05T12:00:00.000Z	bern		how can i go about mounting my windows partition so i can access it from my desktop
2004-11-05T12:01:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	mount -t ntfs ....
2004-11-05T12:05:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	i tried that
2004-11-05T12:05:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	it mounted it, but when i tried to access it, it killed itself
2004-11-05T12:06:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	it locked up the window
2004-11-05T12:06:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	shouldnt happen
2004-11-05T12:07:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	i put $ mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media
2004-11-05T12:08:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	that should work, as long as you are sure that /dev/hda1 is your windows partition
2004-11-05T12:11:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	unless it starts the numbering from 0, which it may
2004-11-05T12:11:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	hrmm
2004-11-05T12:11:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	i think that was it oops
2004-11-05T12:12:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	nope it's hda1
2004-11-05T12:12:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	numbering starts at 1
2004-11-05T12:12:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	but sometimes manufacturers put in an extra "rescue" partition at hda1
2004-11-05T12:31:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	put a line in /etc/fstab for your windows partition
2004-11-05T12:32:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	/dev/hda1  /mnt/windows  ntfs  defaults,noauto 0 0
2004-11-05T12:33:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	put that in /etc/fstab and you'll be able to mount and unmount from the desktop
2004-11-05T12:33:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	what does noauto 0 0 do?
2004-11-05T12:44:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	make sure you have the right case in fstab "/mnt/windows" or "/mnt/Windows"
2004-11-05T12:45:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	ok i figured out what's the matter
2004-11-05T12:45:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	i did ls -l and it only has root permissions
2004-11-05T12:45:00.000Z	bern	bohrbug	what's the chmod to have everyone read
2004-11-05T12:46:00.000Z	bohrbug	bern	chmod ugo+rx /mnt/windows
