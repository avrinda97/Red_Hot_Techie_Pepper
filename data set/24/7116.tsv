2005-05-06T08:23:00.000Z	Choubaka		at least after gcc4 starts breaking things
2005-05-06T08:24:00.000Z	Choubaka		apt meltdown. hee. :)
2005-05-06T08:26:00.000Z	Choubaka		Hmm
2005-05-06T08:26:00.000Z	Choubaka		Actually, I'm afraid of Linux distros becoming mainstream
2005-05-06T08:26:00.000Z	Choubaka		ignorant people might _really_ start using their machines as root.
2005-05-06T08:27:00.000Z	Choubaka		Ubuntu is doing a good thing though, disabling root login :)
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	Choubaka		He'll use sudo
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	Choubaka		and it's good.
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	Choubaka		but if root login were enable, there's a chance the user will use that.
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	Choubaka		enabled*
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	people will only start using root if a) they're home users who use distros who make it easy to run as root pr even pander to it (ahem, linspire), b) they have incompetant IT staff, or c) they *are* incompetant IT staff.
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	or they want stuff easy.
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	no distribution should make it so hard to do anything that people are obliged to run as root
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	yeah
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	if anyone is running as root to '[have]  stuff easy', that distribution has failed as a distribution for that individual.
2005-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	You just said that no distro should become windows. :P
2005-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	actually, windows is moving far, far away from having people run as an administrator.. look at longhorn's fundamentals ;P
2005-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	longhorn isn't here yet.
2005-05-06T08:32:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	no, but it's on the way - winxp actually has quite a lot of options for running as a regular user, the problem is the developers who've developed as administrators and made it impossible not to run as one.
2005-05-06T08:32:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	good point.
2005-05-06T08:33:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis <= that's worth a read if you're interested in this with reference to windows.
2005-05-06T08:33:00.000Z	njan	Choubaka	it will. Longhorn is going to be a very strong product offering. imo, the security model is actually far more capable than the security model in the vanilla linux kernel (and by extension in ubuntu,debian, etc), but we'll see :)
2005-05-06T08:34:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	MS has a reputation of screwing up lots of good stuff with lousy implementation.
2005-05-06T08:34:00.000Z	Choubaka	njan	and as long as they want to maintain legacy compatibility...
