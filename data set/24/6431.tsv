2005-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	centrebullet		Ok I have ubuntu installed but in order to get my wifi going I need the kernel source.  Do I d/l the kernel deb file and install that?
2005-10-24T05:16:00.000Z	centrebullet		Anyone?
2005-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	you just install linux-source
2005-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	deb package?
2005-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	from synaptic or apt-get or deborphan or aptitude or [...] 
2005-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	no net connection that's why I'm asking if I need to d/l the deb, burn to cd and install that way?
2005-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	that would work.
2005-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	look on packages.ubuntu.com for the package
2005-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	I tried that but they arent deb packages
2005-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	the packages on packages.ubuntu.com surely are .deb packages
2005-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	breezy, i386?
2005-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	I tried those I few days ago and it didnt work, yeah intel
2005-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	"it didn't work" how?
2005-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	I can't remember exactly, I think it said something about how the package wasnt the right format
2005-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	get this: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.12/linux-source-2.6.12_2.6.12-9.23_all.deb
2005-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	ah - except you probably just want the kernel HEADERS don't you?  not the full source?
2005-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	Can't I just get the src from kernel.org and use that?
2005-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	you need source which matches the kernel you're running.
2005-10-24T05:23:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	no you dont
2005-10-24T05:23:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	if you want to get the kernel.org source and build it and run that kernel, then that's fine, but it's probably a lot more work than you want to do
2005-10-24T05:23:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	you can be running 2.4.x and install 2.6.x kernel source and it works fine
2005-10-24T05:23:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	you can?
2005-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	centrebullet	dooglus	sure
2005-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	dooglus	centrebullet	why don't you do that then?
