2005-09-05T12:24:00.000Z	_BIJ_		hi @ all...
2005-09-05T12:25:00.000Z	_BIJ_		anyone knows if i get a speed increase when i try to compile my own kernel?
2005-09-05T12:25:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	not enough for a human to notice
2005-09-05T12:27:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	ok so it doesn't really matter if i use the standard ubuntu kernel for i386 or my own because i got an intel centrino...
2005-09-05T12:28:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	you might use the 686 kernel on your i386 ubuntu distro
2005-09-05T12:29:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	the 686 kernel addresses larger amounts of memory and some other refinements for faster newer machines
2005-09-05T12:31:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	and if i want a "faster" optimized kernel for my centrino, do i have to compile my own, or is it possible to download a precompiled ubuntu kernel for centrinos ?
2005-09-05T12:31:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	there is a 686 kernel available via apt-get
2005-09-05T12:34:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	use synaptic and search for kernel
2005-09-05T12:35:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	okay i'll do... MUCHOS GRACIAS! But first of all i got to reinstall my ubuntu, because an upgrade from hoary to breezy wrecked my system...
2005-09-05T12:35:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	da nada
2005-09-05T12:36:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	are you running breezy successfully?
2005-09-05T12:37:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	sorry, you mistook me for indiana jones, i'm not gonna switch to breezy on my production machine until a month after it releases (maybe sooner if i hear no bad news)
2005-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	OK won't call you indy :)
2005-09-05T12:39:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	i have enough trouble running the things i want (that x86 users have)
2005-09-05T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	i run a macintosh with ubuntu
2005-09-05T12:40:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	thats patriotic!
2005-09-05T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	yes, breezy is broken
2005-09-05T12:42:00.000Z	_BIJ_	nalioth	don't you think that macOS rules linux?
2005-09-05T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	#ubuntu-offtopic
2005-09-05T12:47:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	do you know chroot?
2005-09-05T12:49:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	that's what you'll be doing from the liveCD
2005-09-05T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	correct
2005-09-05T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	_BIJ_	i think its just "chroot", tho
