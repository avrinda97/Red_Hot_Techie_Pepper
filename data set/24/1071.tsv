2010-08-13T03:29:00.000Z	zopiac		i installed kde for a while, but it switched my login to KDM. I removed kde today and now I have no graphickal login whatsoever! how do I restore it to GDM?
2010-08-13T03:29:00.000Z	zopiac		dpkg-reconfigure gdm does not work, and I can't unlock gdmsetup to fix it with that
2010-08-13T03:31:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	are you using a "sudo" with the reconfigure? (need to ask to make sure!) Here is a link too: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-switch-between-gdm-and-kdm-on-ubuntu/
2010-08-13T03:46:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	yes I used sudo
2010-08-13T03:47:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	with sudo I do not know why "sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm" is not working.  Is there any output you can pastebin for people here?
2010-08-13T03:48:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	no, there is no output
2010-08-13T03:49:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	I do not know how to proceed from here.  You had KDE installed and then what?  Recap for everyone else here.. ;)
2010-08-13T03:51:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	what if you reinstalled KDE? "sudo apt-get install kuduntu-desktop"?  Would you be willing to try that?
2010-08-13T03:52:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	what if you reinstalled KDE? "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop"?  Would you be willing to try that?
2010-08-13T03:53:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	does "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" pull in something that may be missing?
2010-08-13T03:54:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	yes it does: f-spot firefox firefox-branding firefox-gnome-support gdm-guest-session pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pulseaudio-module-gconf ubufox ubuntu-desktop
2010-08-13T03:55:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	then try the dpkg-reconfigure gdm once those are installed!  Fingers-crossed! ;)
2010-08-13T03:56:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	hmmm...still nothing. I will log in again and try then.
2010-08-13T03:57:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	still nothing
2010-08-13T03:58:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	sorry, I don't know where to go from here.  Hopefully someone else can help generate some leads..  Post your situation every few minutes till someone bites?
2010-08-13T03:58:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	yeah, thanks though!
2010-08-13T03:58:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	you're welcome! :)
2010-08-13T04:00:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	so you can boot into a GNOME graphical environment? I was assuming you were stuck on a command line.  If so, when you log out what session manager appears?  Can you choose icewm from there?
2010-08-13T04:01:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	when i log out it brings me back to CLI
2010-08-13T04:01:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	but you do have a graphical gnome desktop?
2010-08-13T04:02:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	if you have the desktop then shouldn't there be *some* session manager running, even if it is not GDM?
2010-08-13T04:03:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	idk, really. I would assume that it does not /need/ it
2010-08-13T04:03:00.000Z	zopiac	headkase314	brb
2010-08-13T04:03:00.000Z	headkase314	zopiac	I'm not sure either but I was always under the assumption that the session manager bootstrapped the desktop.... idk!
