2008-01-30T08:22:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		hi there
2008-01-30T08:23:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		my gnome (that I use with Compiz at ubuntu 7.10) takes long to load... what can I do to fasten it up?
2008-01-30T08:23:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		*get it faster
2008-01-30T08:24:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		c thanks
2008-01-30T08:26:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		what should I prelink for speeding up gnome?
2008-01-30T08:26:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		and how?
2008-01-30T08:27:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		prelink /path/to/executable
2008-01-30T08:28:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		is there any other way? I mean
2008-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		for example to avoid gnome to load some components?
2008-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	it's the same
2008-01-30T08:30:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	so how come does gnome take longer than kde to load?
2008-01-30T08:31:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	it doesn't. maybe you just have good luck with kde. also, the ubuntu desktop by default loads the deskbar, and other items that take longer to load
2008-01-30T08:32:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	deskbar is the bar with Applications, Places and System menu?
2008-01-30T08:32:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	no it's a little magnofying glass thing with the orange arrow
2008-01-30T08:33:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	also i don't know if kubuntu does so, but trackerd is loaded all the time in gnome which indexes your home directory
2008-01-30T08:34:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	how do I turn it off?
2008-01-30T08:35:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	it can be disabled in System/Administration/Services
2008-01-30T08:35:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	is it advisable to disable it?
2008-01-30T08:36:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	if you don't search through your files often you can disable it without any problems
2008-01-30T08:36:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	also, if you don't have a printer, you can disable the CUPS printer service
2008-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	also, if you don't have bluetooth stuff you can disable bluetooth services
2008-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	Dex-Freudii	those three services are safe to disable
2008-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	bluetooth I don't have it
2008-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	jeffMASTERflex	thank you very much
