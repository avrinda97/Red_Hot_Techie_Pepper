2008-02-05T21:50:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	why did he use it when he's just told me the router doesn't support it
2008-02-10T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	the last 3 people that asked about it with me had turned it off
2008-02-10T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	why noapic for fake read
2008-02-10T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	so you just picked a random kernel parameter
2008-02-11T20:29:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	in a grub prompt ?
2008-02-11T20:29:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	nope, he haid he is fully booted..so I figured he can get another term and issue those
2008-02-11T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	something doesn't add up with that is being said
2008-02-11T20:30:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	right, we are getting confused on which state he is at
2008-04-02T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	he wants to share using his box as a server and over his wifi link (bad call - but it's his idea)
2008-04-02T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	thats what firestart will do, provide connection forwarding or "sharing"
2008-04-02T20:06:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	he needs first some kind of AP or his wifi drivers has to support adhoc and he has to know how to share the wifi connectivity with multiple wifi clients
2008-07-05T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	lshw doesn't show driver status
2008-07-05T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	the card is not associated with the ap, thats the issue, not drivers
2008-07-05T22:06:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	i suspect the drivers is causing it not to associate..thats why i asked if he can compare..
2008-07-05T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	its worked in the past - it's not the drives, he's been on someone elses network which has changed his default setup
2008-07-05T22:08:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	ah okay..didnt know that
2008-07-05T22:08:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	hence why downing the interfaces, using iwconfig to set the parameters correctly, and then bringing it up should reset it
2008-07-05T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	there are known bugs with encyption on/off for the intel cards and the gnome setup tool
2008-07-05T22:09:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	okay
2008-07-20T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	turorial in what ?
2008-07-20T21:45:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	the basic usage
2008-08-06T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	can we keep that sort of stuff out of the channe;
2008-08-06T19:08:00.000Z	amenado	ikonia	sorry..
2008-08-06T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	amenado	not a problem
