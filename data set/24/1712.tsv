2010-05-27T07:42:00.000Z	brax		Why doesn't anyone know anything about dpkg!?
2010-05-27T07:42:00.000Z	brax		:C
2010-05-27T07:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	pastebin the command you are using and the errors you are getting
2010-05-27T07:48:00.000Z	brax	onetinsoldier	What do you see in it?
2010-05-27T07:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	i'm not sure what to think. hard to know why the postinst script is failing
2010-05-27T07:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	i know how to make it so that the packages are gone as far as you package manager goes, but the files from those packages will still be left on your hard drive.
2010-05-27T07:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	has to be the one to want to do it ;-)
2010-05-27T07:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	it would stop the error messages. do you want to do it?
2010-05-27T07:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	once the errors are gone, you could then reinstall those two packages and then remove them. that's what most people do when i have them do this kind of operation
2010-05-27T07:58:00.000Z	brax	onetinsoldier	that sounds good. Lead the way, captain.
2010-05-27T07:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	ok, you need to be careful edit this file --> /var/lib/dpkg/status
2010-05-27T07:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	you know how to edit it as root?
2010-05-27T07:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	ok. when you have it open, you see how all the package have their own section in there?
2010-05-27T08:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	ok, you need to remove the entire section for those two packages that are giving you trouble
2010-05-27T08:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	ok, save the file and close it.... then try --> sudo apt-get -s -f install
2010-05-27T08:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	that caommand will run apt-get in simulation mode to show you waht it would do without actually doing it
2010-05-27T08:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	:-)
2010-05-27T08:12:00.000Z	brax	onetinsoldier	How do we do the second part?
2010-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	second part?
2010-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	you mean reinstall those two?
2010-05-27T08:13:00.000Z	brax	onetinsoldier	Yeah, so I can get rid of them. Is it just a typical install then?
2010-05-27T08:14:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	yes
2010-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	yes?
2010-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	brax	haha. cheers. take care
