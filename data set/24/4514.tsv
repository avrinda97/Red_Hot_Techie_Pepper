2007-03-23T07:43:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	Synaptic
2007-03-23T07:44:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	It's good to get into the habit early.
2007-03-23T07:46:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	If you have Adept, you don't need Synaptic too.
2007-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	Adept/Synaptic only install packages.
2007-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	Ooh, using RPM's requires the commandline.
2007-03-23T07:48:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	I could easily give you the command, it would take me a minute to type up.
2007-03-23T07:49:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	try this first.
2007-03-23T07:53:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	You need to enable the other repositories besides restricted and security or whatever's on by default.
2007-03-23T07:55:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	there is a simpler way, I told you.
2007-03-23T07:57:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	You forgot to sudo, or you have another instance of apt-get running.
2007-03-23T07:59:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	GTK-gnutella
2007-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	No, that's on the command line.
2007-03-23T08:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	sudo apt-get install wine :)
2007-03-23T08:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross	daifunai	The CLI is bloody easy.
