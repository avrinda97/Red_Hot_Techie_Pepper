2008-02-22T21:24:00.000Z	RickJones		hello, after doing a port scan on my machine i have this as an open port : ansyslmd . please how do i shut this off ?
2008-02-22T21:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	it seems that its the ansys license manager... do you use ansys on your linux box??
2008-02-22T21:26:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	i don't even know what that is
2008-02-22T21:26:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	google says it's a xp thing, yet i run 7.10. any ideas?
2008-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	ansys is a FEM (finite element method) package iirc
2008-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	netstat -putan | grep -i ansys
2008-02-22T21:28:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	upon doing that command it shows nothing ( it also asked me to be root)
2008-02-22T21:29:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	is it possible that port/program is running on another machine on my lan ?
2008-02-22T21:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	how did tyou run the port scan? if you scanned all the LAN and not only your host it is possible
2008-02-22T21:31:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	so as long as netstat -putan | grep -i ansys shows nothing, i should start looking at other machines on the LAN ?
2008-02-22T21:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	well i'm not sure what the command did is check if you have a daemon running with the ansys wrod on it
2008-02-22T21:33:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	so since i show no open process, yet an open port , it's possible it's a different machine.....
2008-02-22T21:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	i dunno without knowing how you did the port scan...
2008-02-22T21:37:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2
2008-02-22T21:37:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	that is the url reporting the open port
2008-02-22T21:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	are you behind a router??
2008-02-22T21:43:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	yes
2008-02-22T21:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	maybe is the router the one reporting that open port?? or a server in the DMZ ??
2008-02-22T21:45:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	no dmz ips in the router
2008-02-22T21:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	http://www.grc.com/port_1055.htm   Can you do 'netstat -putan | grep 1055'
2008-02-22T21:48:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	i show no open ports on this machien. so i need to unhook one by one and track this down...
2008-02-22T21:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	good luck
2008-02-22T21:50:00.000Z	RickJones	erUSUL	thank you for your help
2008-02-22T21:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	RickJones	no problem
