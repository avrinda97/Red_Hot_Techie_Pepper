2007-08-31T11:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fireman_	you should never be logged in as root.

2007-08-31T11:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fireman_	you probably had something open(like synaptic), that was using root access, one root access priv. at a time

2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	fireman_		I hate grub with a passion, and partitions for that matter. It kept screwing me over IndyGunFreak I lost all my data when I installed SuSE 10.
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fireman_	then that was your own fault, should have backedup
2007-08-31T11:45:00.000Z	fireman_	IndyGunFreak	I know it was, now I have learned from my mistake and have obtained an external.
