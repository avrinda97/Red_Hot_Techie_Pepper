2010-06-01T01:12:00.000Z	bricky		gunbert: are there any other cool apps for ubuntu?
2010-06-01T01:12:00.000Z	bricky		or very useful  apps
2010-06-01T01:13:00.000Z	bricky		I like the zoom feature myself, compiz fusion doesnt 'fully work' it works somewhat,
2010-06-01T01:14:00.000Z	bricky		I cant get the cube or the fire, but I can zoom in, have my windows wobble,
2010-06-01T01:14:00.000Z	bricky		gunbert: that reminds me, that is repo based huh?
2010-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	What doesn't 'fully work' about it?
2010-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	I type compiz in run, screen refreshes, can have some effects but I dont have the fire or the 'ctrl alt' cube
2010-06-03T11:07:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	thanks :)
2010-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	was able to run rovclock I recalling having aticonfig I thought that was standard
2010-06-03T11:18:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	If you install fglrx with that card on anything later than 9.04, you will not have 3D
2010-06-03T11:18:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	oh ok
2010-06-03T11:18:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	Its not a matter of rebuilding compiz. fglrx simply does not support your card at all anymore
2010-06-03T11:19:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	but it says it does I suppose thats why i'm abit confused
2010-06-03T11:19:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	thanks for clearing that up
2010-06-03T11:20:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	As I said before, you can ask about specifics in #radeon since that is the official open radeon driver channel (and the only one that supports your card directly)
2010-06-03T11:20:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	aticonfig, ati catalyst, proprietary driver, fglrx are ALL the same thing
2010-06-03T11:21:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	With the open driver you use things like driconf
2010-06-03T11:21:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	You need to register your nick to talk in the driver support channel
2010-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	one more thing not about drivers, Im trying to do VM ware,
2010-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	But driconf offers a way to change 3D options unrelated to clocking
2010-06-03T11:22:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	ahh!
2010-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	You need to ask in #radeon how to do the clocking stuff or if it is supported for your card
2010-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	bricky	soreau	thanks man I iwll register
2010-06-20T15:10:00.000Z	soreau	bricky	What do you mean by go into svideo?
