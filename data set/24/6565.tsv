2010-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 you can take/use a new filesystem on some other drive and move /home to it.. or move some users /home/username to it.
2010-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 a directory dosent have 'drive space' - filesystems do. :)
2010-01-31T09:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 i did it once ages ago for shareing a ntfs over samba.. but  I dont recall what i had to do.
2010-01-31T09:15:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	: i tried to asign the values  by folowing an guide in the community centre i mean to say by referring documentation but i am not able to figer out the exact values ... as after reborting i found my d drive that i want to share on network was not showing up in my linux box so  i am looking out for that particular values ... so that i can assign it ...
2010-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	: ya i agree with you .. so i am looking for some more elobrate explationation on this issue on internet so that i can get an clear idea .. on this topic .. so that i can use it in much better way .. ;)
2010-01-31T09:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 yea i always add a samba password for each of my linux users. :)
2010-02-07T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 not really. ive seen peple in jhere befir with 'speakers vs headphone'  problems. My speakers do have a headphone port.. so ive never tried it
2010-03-24T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 ive seen dozens of Headphone+Mics - some are usb. some use the mic/audio out cables..  whats the problem exactly?
2010-03-24T18:23:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	I am on Hp mini 110 and it is  having only one single point of input for mic/audio .. although i am having an ordinary headphone  with two jack but it's not supporting well ... so I am looking for an manufacturer who can meat my requirement ..
2010-03-24T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 ive seen splitter plugs at radio shack for such combo ports.    Take the thing in and see if they can find a proper  splitter
2010-03-24T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 or check the manuals for that  mini. could be they tell what you need to use.
2010-03-24T18:26:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	 according to the manual it says it's compatible to iphones  head phone ..
2010-03-24T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 that means very little to me.  Ive never owned an iphone. and never will
2010-03-24T18:29:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	 ok thanks for your time .. I have to find some body in locality to gave an cross cake .. with that ..
2010-03-29T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 a usb speaker may be more trouble then its worth.
2011-05-28T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 set up grub2 on the flash drive to boot the ISO file.
2011-05-28T14:09:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	any help links available for that?
2011-05-28T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ranjan	 theres guides for doing grub2/iso  - i got some bookmarked at the delicious.com/dr_willis
2011-05-28T14:10:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	thank you let me check
2011-05-28T14:11:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	but as u said again there is grub2 dependency no? isnt it possible by using some stuffs like syslinux.
2011-05-28T14:12:00.000Z	ranjan	Dr_Willis	if we are on an older distribution then again it would be trouble to find grub2
