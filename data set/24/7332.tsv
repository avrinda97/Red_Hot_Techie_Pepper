2005-02-03T15:39:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		skype is proprietary.
2005-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		therefore it shouldn't be used.
2005-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		but it's proprietary.
2005-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		"free to use" != should use.
2005-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		he's free to use mp3 too.  doesn't mean he shoudl.
2005-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		a proprietary protocol is never the right tool.

2005-02-04T06:09:00.000Z	meskes	BROKEN_LADDER	if you want to use something like that to a remote site, use ipsec.
2005-02-04T06:10:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	meskes	now there's a thought.
