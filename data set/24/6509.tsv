2007-09-21T14:24:00.000Z	NCLI		I installed Feisty a few minutes ago, totally clean install, after formatting my HDD. However, when I start my laptop, it doesnt even open Grub. After the OS boot screen, it just displays a blank screen with a blinking cursor in the top left corner, nothing else.
2007-09-21T14:24:00.000Z	NCLI		If I try to boot from the install cd, it does the same thing. I installed the 32 bit version.
2007-09-21T14:26:00.000Z	NCLI		Even if your ideas are totally out there, give it a shot, plese.

2007-09-21T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	installing in vmware?
2007-09-21T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	how long have you waited for something to happen?
2007-09-21T14:32:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	pay attention to who you're talking to. -- You can't boot the install CD at all now?
2007-09-21T14:34:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	Ubuntu wouldn't access your BIOS settings. Do you have a floppy drive by any chance?
2007-09-21T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	no, don
2007-09-21T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	no, don't worry, it's just a frequent cause of the problem you describe, a non-boot floppy left in the drive ;)
2007-09-21T14:38:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	can you enter your BIOS setup?
2007-09-21T14:38:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	you want to check whether your BIOS is still aware of your hard disk drive.
2007-09-21T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	the first being the CD-ROM drive?
2007-09-21T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	have you got any USB devices attached?
2007-09-21T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	your problem sounds to me like it's hardware related. I don't think it's got anything to do with your feisty installation.
2007-09-21T14:44:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	coincidence.
2007-09-21T14:44:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	it's just a guess, I may be wrong. Please ask the channel again, I'll keep out of it :)
2007-09-21T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	leave more time between repetitions please -- give new people a chance to log on before you repeat.
2007-09-21T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	are you being intentionally rude?
2007-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	NCLI	you've got a hardware problem, and that's that.
