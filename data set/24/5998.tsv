2006-03-03T14:11:00.000Z	Fatal73		Im also looking for some help regarding the w32codecs
2006-03-03T14:12:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	what about them?

2006-03-03T14:15:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	install totem-xine
2006-03-03T14:16:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	does it come with ubuntu, or will I need to find the .deb packages?
2006-03-03T14:16:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	it's in synaptic
2006-03-03T14:16:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	have you enabled universe?
2006-03-03T14:16:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	no I havent
2006-03-03T14:20:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	I cant use repositories because my ubuntu pc doesnt connect to the internet, does that mean I'll have to go looking for the package to download?
2006-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	probably, packages.ubuntu.com.  Make sure you get all the dependencies for it
2006-03-03T14:23:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	put ubuntu on the windows pc is what I would do :)
2006-03-03T14:24:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	dual boot
2006-03-03T14:40:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	are you there?
2006-03-03T14:41:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	yep, what's up?
2006-03-03T14:42:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	the totem-xine .deb package refuses to install because it says it conflicts with totem-gstreamer
2006-03-03T14:43:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	or does it not offer that as an option?
2006-03-03T14:43:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	no option, just says it refuses
2006-03-03T14:44:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	remove gstreamer first then
2006-03-03T14:44:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	totem-gstreamer that is
2006-03-03T14:45:00.000Z	Fatal73	_jason	what exactly does that package do, are you sure I can just remove it?
2006-03-03T14:45:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	use synaptic to remove it, totem-gstreamer uses gstreamer as a backend, totem-xine uses xine as a backend (for totem)
2006-03-03T15:00:00.000Z	_jason	Fatal73	cya
