2008-04-10T20:47:00.000Z	dave421		Hi folks - how do I install the dummy network adapter module?
2008-04-10T20:48:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	what do you mean with 'dummy network adapter module'?
2008-04-10T20:49:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	you might be refering to the loopback interface, 127.0.0.1
2008-04-10T20:49:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	hmm, never seen that before and it seems awfully useless to me...
2008-04-10T20:50:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- not at all.  I'm using EC2 with an ubuntu image, and i'm going to be running software that requires a network adapter with a specific MAC address.  I can't change the MAC address of eth0, because that makes the EC2 instance unreachable
2008-04-10T20:51:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	that sounds like you're trying to fool a bad copy protection
2008-04-10T20:51:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- no, I'm doing this with the permission of the company that makes it
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	there's really no reason we should beleive that ;)
2008-04-10T20:52:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- there's no reason to not believe it!
2008-04-10T20:53:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	the all-to-commonness of piracy is ;) But anyway, there's a 'dummy' module in my kernel. Doesn't 'sudo modprobe dummy' work for you?
2008-04-10T20:53:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- nope, it says "FATAL: Module dummy not found"
2008-04-10T20:53:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	odd, which kernel version?
2008-04-10T20:54:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	ah, you built your own kernel
2008-04-10T20:54:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- well, actually I used an existing EC2 image provided through Amazon
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	this is Ubuntu support, not EC2 support :)
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- the problem is with Ubuntu, not EC2
2008-04-10T20:55:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	ubuntu kernels have this module. You don't run an Ubuntu kernel
2008-04-10T20:56:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- it's a ubuntu kernel
2008-04-10T20:57:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	ask Amazon for support then.
2008-04-10T20:57:00.000Z	dave421	Seveas	- it's a UBUNTU KERNEL :)
2008-04-10T20:57:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	it is not
2008-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	ubuntu 7.10 has 2.6.20, not 2.6.16
2008-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	so for the last time: it's not an Ubuntu problem. Ask amazon/ec2 for support.
2008-04-10T21:35:00.000Z	Seveas	dave421	unless you disabled it, it starts automatically at startup
