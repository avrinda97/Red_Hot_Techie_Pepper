2005-02-27T14:33:00.000Z	Kenotic		If my video card was working with the other kernel and all I did was an apt-get upgrade and got the new one it should still work correct?
2005-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	nvidia?
2005-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	no problem
2005-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	the new kernel works with the linux-restricted-modules
2005-02-27T14:35:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	what version of kernel and l-r-m do you have?
2005-02-27T14:37:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	you're using Warty?
2005-02-27T14:38:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	what version of linux-restricted-modules do you have?
2005-02-27T14:38:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	it needs to match your kernel version exactly
2005-02-27T14:39:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	it needs to match your kernel version exactly.  That's the proble.
2005-02-27T14:39:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	updating now
2005-02-27T14:43:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	That worked
2005-02-27T14:43:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	no problem :)
2005-02-27T14:46:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	I have a dumb question. What does l-r-m do?
2005-02-27T14:47:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	it contains "restricted" modules like nvidia and fglrx
2005-02-27T14:48:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	Maybe it is just not me understanding how Debian and Ubuntu does things but why didnt installing the nvidia kernel give me the module?
2005-02-27T14:49:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	you installed nvidia-glx, not a kernel module
2005-02-27T14:49:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	the module itself is in l-r-m
2005-02-27T14:49:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	I really have nvidia-kernel-common installed
2005-02-27T14:50:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	No big deal I was just wondering
2005-02-27T14:50:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	yes, I know
2005-02-27T14:50:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	but that contains other files
2005-02-27T14:50:00.000Z	Kenotic	tritium	Just was a little confusing
2005-02-27T14:50:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	"dpkg -L nvidia-kernel-common"
2005-02-27T14:51:00.000Z	tritium	Kenotic	it doesn't contain anything in /lib/modules
