2006-07-19T09:14:00.000Z	`Evil`	richiefrich	oh, i havent plugged it in yet, the reason being xp doesnt support that old card and crashes, so didnt want ubuntu to do that as well, should i install it if there wont be any issues?

2006-07-19T09:51:00.000Z	`Evil`	richiefrich	k, ubuntu also didnt say anything like new hardware, so any idea how to go about it? or should i just try tvtime w/o anything?
