2011-08-02T22:13:00.000Z	vf-1j		Greetings all, my seamonkey application keeps crashing. Here is the terminal output when it occurs: http://pastebin.com/8C6Bv1xL
2011-08-02T22:15:00.000Z	vf-1j		What does 'buffer overflow' mean?
2011-08-02T22:16:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	It means a buffer that has so much stuff in it that stuff gets lost cause the buffer is not large enough to hold it all
2011-08-02T22:16:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	This is attributed to my Seamonkey application
2011-08-02T22:17:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	Seamonkey is a browser?
2011-08-02T22:17:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	Correct
2011-08-02T22:18:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	I don't know what buffer it is referring to (or what buffers there are).  Usually buffers are used to accept packets on the network card.  If too many packets are recieved (before they can be processed) the buffer will overflow with packets and they'll be lost.  This is what happens in a DDOS attack
2011-08-02T22:23:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	It is definitely a software issue.  Buffers exist only in software
2011-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	Have you done a memtest recently?  If not then you can't claim you're rigorous about checking hardware
2011-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	thanks, I think a solution is to build from source and launch the application manuallyu
2011-08-02T22:24:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	Yes I do regularly
2011-08-02T22:25:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	Are you overclocking?
2011-08-02T22:25:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	No
2011-08-02T22:25:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	You want to compile every program that is doing this from source?
2011-08-02T22:26:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	Seamonkey is a modest browser application, however I store a lot of e-mails. As for compiling from source, it seems to be the only way to get the program I need to work. Alternately, I can just use another distro. For instance, this issue never occurs in Slackware
2011-08-02T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	Sounds like you have the answers to your own questions.
2011-08-02T22:27:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	No, the buffer memory thing is still an issue I have not resolved with Ubuntu\
2011-08-02T22:28:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	I have no idea what is causing the problem.  I can only suggest test to start doing that are very generic like changing the kernel
2011-08-02T22:28:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	There is an idea
2011-08-02T22:28:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	perhaps it's a good one
2011-08-02T22:29:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	It sounds about right
2011-08-02T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	good luck
2011-08-02T22:29:00.000Z	vf-1j	edbian	Thanks for your help]
2011-08-02T22:30:00.000Z	edbian	vf-1j	sure
