2008-07-14T09:10:00.000Z	teamtrimble		hey all! any lawyers in here?
2008-07-14T09:11:00.000Z	teamtrimble		looking to remaster ubuntu similar to the way Dell did. Trying to get restricted format support for my customers, even if I haveto pay for it.
2008-07-14T09:12:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	you mean the dvd stuff?
2008-07-14T09:13:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	that, and mp3 and such. i believe that fluendo sells the legal (USA) codecs, but not for DVD. I heard there's a LinDVD product for that
2008-07-14T09:13:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	I know there is a restricted extras package, if that is what you are talking about, which is free (as in beer, not freedom).
2008-07-14T09:15:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	I don't think that it's legal in the USA, I know where it is, but the last thing I want is for the RIAA to come after me or my customers.
2008-07-14T09:16:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	Personally, I think that it sucks, but as a business owner, i have more concerns than the average joe :)
2008-07-14T09:17:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	it is legal.
2008-07-14T09:19:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	there is a a libdvdcss package somewhere, it will deencrypt dvds so they can be played, which is alos legal.
2008-07-14T09:19:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	If this stuff wasn't legal, a lot of people would have gotten sued already or something
2008-07-14T09:21:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	I don't know. Why do we get the warnings about not being legal in USA and same for libdvdcss if it's legal?
2008-07-14T09:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	where are you getting warnings?
2008-07-14T09:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	that says that for every contry.
2008-07-14T09:25:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	It says to check your local laws, it doesn't change the message for different contries

2008-07-14T09:27:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	I don't know where to look if it's legal.
2008-07-14T09:28:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	i don't really either, though i assume there is some place you can contact...
2008-07-14T09:29:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	i think/assume the multiverse repo is legal in the us.
2008-07-14T09:36:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	libdvdcss is legal in the USA.
2008-07-14T09:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libdvdcss#Comparison_with_DeCSS see the last sentence
2008-07-14T09:37:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	can you point me to some documentation?
2008-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	teamtrimble	Ashfire908	thanks! ...and what about mp3 and windows media?
2008-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Ashfire908	teamtrimble	looking at lame in the resrticted extras, only one that could be non-free, i know the licences/issues with them all, but vlc can do wma and all that stuff... to my knoledge
