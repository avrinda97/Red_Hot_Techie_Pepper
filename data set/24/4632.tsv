2007-02-21T09:24:00.000Z	hkn		do you guys know if ubuntu 6.06 has perc 2/dc support?
2007-02-21T09:25:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	yes it does, i have a couple of machines running those cards
2007-02-21T09:25:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	i am having some issues when the install cd gets to partman it is sitting there for a long time, did you have similar issues?
2007-02-21T09:26:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	no, the only problem i had was when i wanted to use one of the old servers as a workstation and tried to get X working...it didn't work
2007-02-21T09:27:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	would it be possible for me to ask you a few questions then about setting up the hardware raid?
2007-02-21T09:28:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	it's been a while since i installed it but sure, ask away
2007-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	are you sure that's not a perc3 instead of perc2?
2007-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	when i setup the drives i did 4 in an array and 2 as hsp then ran initialize so it shows up as a 54gb raid 5 logical drive 0 is that right so far?
2007-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	the bios version says perc 2 version 2.5
2007-02-21T09:30:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	yeah, that sounds good
2007-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	its a poweredge 6400 with 4 xeon p3s
2007-02-21T09:31:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	ok, i just thought a 6400 would have a newer card, the ones i installed on were old PE 2450's
2007-02-21T09:32:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	heh, it was free :)
2007-02-21T09:32:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	awesome
2007-02-21T09:33:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	so i run the lamp server install off the ubuntu cd and it gets gives an iop error then starts the install and i get past configuring the ethernet and it starts partman and doesn't progress
2007-02-21T09:34:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	since you said the raid was ok i don't know what would be the hangup
2007-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	my drives were already partitioned when i installed. we just migrated some slackware servers to ubuntu
2007-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	but it shouldn't matter because partman still ran, i just didn't change anything
2007-02-21T09:36:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	i would try to fdisk it from a shell
2007-02-21T09:36:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	ok, will try that
2007-02-21T09:44:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	do you know if i have to format the scsi drives before i use the live cd?
2007-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	verbose	hkn	you shouldn't have to, you should be able to at least fdisk and mke2fs them from the livecd
2007-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	the ubuntu live cd doesn't know what the command fdisk -l means:)
2007-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	hkn	verbose	im going to use a different live cd to format the drive
