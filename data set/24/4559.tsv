2007-12-31T00:48:00.000Z	c0nka		?/?
2007-12-31T00:48:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	i'd go with 32bit unless you have a 64 bit box and need support for 4+GB Ram...  ppc if you have a ppc. if you have to ask, you probably dont have a ppc3
2007-12-31T00:49:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	i dont no what i have how do you find out
2007-12-31T00:49:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	are you using a pc? or a mac?
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	c0nka		pc
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	pc
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	and yer in... windows right now?
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	c0nka		yeah
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	yeah
2007-12-31T00:50:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	you can Start Menu > Control Panel > System  ...   the screen will give you info about processor and RAM, IIRC... But really, go with 32bit
2007-12-31T00:51:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	32 bit will be easier, and really, if you dont need support for huge amounts of RAM, it's your best bet
2007-12-31T00:52:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	it says amd athlon 64 processor 3200+
2007-12-31T00:52:00.000Z	unravel		it can, from what i understand, be a pain to get flash/java/stuff working under 64 bit, especially for new users.
2007-12-31T00:52:00.000Z	unravel		and 32 bit will run fine on your box
2007-12-31T00:53:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	and should the live cd work
2007-12-31T00:54:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	and should the live cd work
2007-12-31T00:55:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	have you tried it yet?  if not, it should. SOME people do have problems with it but most can use it fine
2007-12-31T00:55:00.000Z	c0nka	unravel	ok i gaurantee it will be me having problems with it
2007-12-31T00:55:00.000Z	c0nka		Laughing Out Loud
2007-12-31T00:56:00.000Z	unravel	c0nka	think positive :P
