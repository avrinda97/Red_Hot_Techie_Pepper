2009-02-23T07:55:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS		if I have no sound in flash what do i do? libflashsupport installed
2009-02-23T07:57:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 I think what you may actually want is to enable multiverse then look in synaptic for Package flashplugin-nonfree
2009-02-23T07:59:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 I think what you installed is the libflash-mozilla plugin which is the one that lets mozilla use flash
2009-02-23T08:01:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 just make sure to go into software sources and enable multiverse
2009-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	same thing should i restart?
2009-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 did you close out firefox and restart it
2009-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	yes
2009-02-23T08:03:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 Which site are you having the issue with?
2009-02-23T08:04:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	youtube
2009-02-23T08:05:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 Do you have sound on other flash sites?
2009-02-23T08:08:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	same problem with the other ones
2009-02-23T08:09:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 can you go into your system- preferences sound- and then test all the sound channels to make sure you have sound in all of them
2009-02-23T08:10:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	only music and movies work
2009-02-23T08:11:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 try some of the other playback for sound playback-- see if it can get it make sound through them- THat is probably why you hear no sound using flash
2009-02-23T08:13:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	it works ALSA
2009-02-23T08:13:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 Now try you-tube
2009-02-23T08:14:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	same problem
2009-02-23T08:15:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 Question? do you have onboard sound plus a seperate sound card?
2009-02-23T08:16:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	just the one on motherboard btw i just tested in opera and it worked but not in firefox
2009-02-23T08:16:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 Then install the  libflash-mozplugin (you have to have both installed)
2009-02-23T08:18:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	it worked
2009-02-23T08:18:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	ty
2009-02-23T08:19:00.000Z	redvamp128	ERROR_SUCCESS	 I think you had the moz plugin without having flash
2009-02-23T08:19:00.000Z	ERROR_SUCCESS	redvamp128	yeah
