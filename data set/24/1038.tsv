2010-09-04T11:11:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_		hi all, a  simple question. are x86_64 and i686 architectures same on intel processors?
2010-09-04T11:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	yes, amd64 will run on a 64bit intel and all processors past about 1994 will run the 32bit OS
2010-09-11T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	check volume is not muted in gnome volume app as well as alsamixer in terminal
2010-09-11T22:59:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: please tell me how to check this out
2010-09-11T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	like the previous statement said. Open terminal and run alsamixer
2010-09-11T23:01:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: i ran "sudo alsamixer" it is showing : no such file
2010-09-11T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	when did I mention sudo?
2010-09-11T23:01:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	 i also tried : alsamixer . it is showing the same
2010-09-11T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	if you run all commands with sudo you WILL break your system
2010-09-11T23:02:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: ok,sorry for that.but for now what to do?
2010-09-11T23:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	install alsamixer and alsa
2010-09-11T23:07:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: i have downloaded the things but  still it is not working :(
2010-09-11T23:08:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: i mean alsamixer and alsa( oss) and alsa( gnome )
2010-09-11T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	what is the output of: lsb_release -c
2010-09-11T23:09:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: 1 hour back it was  working properly. but to hibernate the system i downloaded the powersavermanagement utility . for then it is not working.
2010-09-11T23:10:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: the command output : Codename: lucid
2010-09-11T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	ok. How did you install the OS?
2010-09-11T23:12:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: first win7  and after some days of that ubuntu 10.04. but as i said it was working fine 1 hour back but after........... not working
2010-09-11T23:13:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: one more thing . in windows sound is  intact.  but for ubuntu  ...:(
2010-09-11T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	ubuntu has different support to windows. What windows does or doesn't do is of no consequence to linux
2010-09-11T23:15:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	ActionParsnip	: so please tell me what to do? after alsamixer and alsa installation it is still not working.
2010-09-11T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	try the alsa .23 ppa
2010-09-11T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_mrn_ver_	https://launchpad.net/~ricotz/%2Barchive/unstable
