2009-11-13T05:07:00.000Z	emanuel__		So nobody can help me with my Synaptics slowness issues? Waah!
2009-11-13T05:08:00.000Z	emanuel__		I hear there's this new thing called Ubuntu Software Center or whatnot...
2009-11-13T05:10:00.000Z	emanuel__		Another thing: How can I configure sudo/PolicyKit/SeaHorse/whatever to not time out on authorizing my user as admin so quickly? Is there a global way to do that? Those "enter your p/w" dialogs are getting old real quickly...
2009-11-13T05:11:00.000Z	emanuel__		Actually those "tons of things" gnome loads don't add much to your boot time.
2009-11-13T05:12:00.000Z	emanuel__		I have a GNOME desktop in less than 30 s. U 9.10, old Pentium 4 based computer.
2009-11-13T05:12:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 thats pretty good for 9.10
2009-11-13T05:12:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 I would say very very good :)
2009-11-13T05:13:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	really?
2009-11-13T05:13:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 yeah karmis boot sequence leaves much to be desired and wanted
2009-11-13T05:14:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	RAID much?
2009-11-13T05:14:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 no  even though I have scsi drives here :)
2009-11-13T05:15:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	I have found that when you start worrying about bootup times, you need to look into this new stuff called "hibernation" :-)
2009-11-13T05:15:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	on a desktop?
2009-11-13T05:16:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	Definitely
2009-11-13T05:16:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 well I am comparing 9.10 to all previous version now :)
2009-11-13T05:16:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	Another thing, check out bootchart and use static IP if you have a router
2009-11-13T05:18:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 mmm  well almost the same system since ubuntu 4.10   this is the slowest booting version :)
2009-11-13T05:18:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	bloat tends to work like that
2009-11-13T05:18:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 I think you may be right  and also grub2  at least at t his beta stage
2009-11-13T05:19:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	remove everything you don't need and watch out for weird things like IPV6 timeouts etc. etc.
2009-11-13T05:19:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	 i will try that thanks :)
2009-11-13T05:20:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	My gentoo kernel had no IPV6 support, saved me lots of timeout related headaches
2009-11-13T05:21:00.000Z	coz_	emanuel__	ah gentoo....
2009-11-13T05:21:00.000Z	emanuel__	coz_	Ah, indeed.
