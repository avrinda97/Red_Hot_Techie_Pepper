2005-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	I thought ubuntu was a debian?
2005-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	no, only debian is debian
2005-11-30T17:20:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	 Ok I see... ;)
2005-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	ubuntu will have different library versions than debian. dependencies will break. some scripts won't work
2005-11-30T17:21:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	it totally depends on the problem
2005-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	When i launch my computer, gnome won't start anymore, I do'nt have any gui, just a terminal logon promt. When I log on, and try to start X, it raises an error. Smame goes when I try to start nautilus or kde.
2005-11-30T17:22:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	you used to have gdm? the graphical login?
2005-11-30T17:23:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	I used to have gdm, the grapgical login
2005-11-30T17:24:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	well, X is broken somehow. try to reconfigure it with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-11-30T17:25:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	what kind of error messages do you get? X errors also leave logs in /var/log
2005-11-30T17:25:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	So basically I should logon ithout the gui, and do "sudo  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	I'm not sure how to get to /var/log without the gui :s
2005-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	yeah, if you don't want to read the logs and find out what exactly is wrong :)
2005-11-30T17:26:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	cd /var/log. list the files with ls, read them with less
2005-11-30T17:27:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	i'll look what the exact log file is, hold on
2005-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	Ok. What is less? a terminal based text reader?
2005-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	probably /var/log/Xorg.0.log has the most recent errors
2005-11-30T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	yes, less is a pager for long files and command outputs
2005-11-30T17:31:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	I'm using a live session, I'll try that, than I'll come back to tell what errors I've read... thanx
2005-11-30T17:32:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	:)
2005-11-30T17:32:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	not to you it isn't =)
2005-11-30T17:33:00.000Z	topyli	Akonkwa2	yeah, and scroll down untill you find errors
2005-11-30T17:33:00.000Z	Akonkwa2	topyli	I'm using a live session, I'll try that, than I'll come back to tell what errors I've read... thanx
