2005-03-16T16:07:00.000Z	njs12345		anyone know why I get this error when trying to install the fglrx drivers:
2005-03-16T16:08:00.000Z	njs12345		trying to overwrite '/usr/X11R6/bin/fgl_glxgears', which is also in package fglrx-6-8-0
2005-03-16T16:09:00.000Z	njs12345		then it says "dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)
2005-03-16T16:09:00.000Z	njs12345		I have two as well
2005-03-16T16:09:00.000Z	njs12345		and four have run linux at some point or another
2005-03-16T16:10:00.000Z	njs12345		or some variation of that
2005-03-16T16:11:00.000Z	njs12345		mp3 support can't be shipped because it has patent problems
2005-03-16T16:11:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	no one is inforcing it though, which makes it somewhat more annoying...
2005-03-16T16:12:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	imo, if Debian can ship something, everyone should feel safe to do the same...
2005-03-16T16:13:00.000Z	njs12345	lunitik	I haven't researched the matter, I'm just saying what I've heard =)
2005-03-16T16:13:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	didn't see your question... what was it?
2005-03-16T16:15:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	dpkg --force-overwrite -i thepackage   (may need to apt-get -d install thepackage if you're getting it from online)
2005-03-16T16:15:00.000Z	njs12345	lunitik	woot! thanks
2005-03-16T16:16:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	yw
2005-03-16T16:18:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	XChat is gnome based... same thing
2005-03-16T16:18:00.000Z	njs12345	lunitik	http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx/
2005-03-16T16:19:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	oh... uhh... ouch
2005-03-16T16:19:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	looks ugly!
2005-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	I like the current look... that just looks cluttered
2005-03-16T16:21:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	current XChat, you can have it so that all that shows is the input field, any tabs, and the chat area, everything else can be hidden... looks simple and nice
2005-03-16T16:38:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	the mplayer packages don't contain the i part
2005-03-16T16:39:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	you probably want 'mplayer-686'
2005-03-16T16:40:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	also... k7 is only a transition package... depending on k6
2005-03-16T16:40:00.000Z	lunitik	njs12345	now you do
