2006-05-03T11:46:00.000Z	r0xoR		when i do "System Tools -> New Login" my resolv.conf gets overwritten as if it were trying to use DHCP
2006-05-03T11:46:00.000Z	r0xoR		what is going on with that?
2006-05-03T11:47:00.000Z	r0xoR		and, once i've done New Login, how do i switch between the currently active logins
2006-05-03T11:48:00.000Z	r0xoR		anyone? how do i switch logins? not just "new login" but there's gotta be a "switch login" functionality too
2006-05-03T11:48:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	there is a package to do that

2006-05-04T05:23:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	put the output on pastebin
2006-05-04T05:23:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	it's only one line: No supported architectures found, please contact authors in #easyubuntu on irc.freenode.net for help
2006-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	are you using dapper?
2006-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	which i'm doing but no one's responded over in #easyubuntu yet
2006-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	using breezy
2006-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	it should work
2006-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	hahah, ok great, well it's not
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	shh im thinking.
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	the app comes up but it's blank basically... it's got the tabs but nothing under them
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	i did recompile a custom kernel by hand
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	i686 sorta, it's an Athlon 64
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	shouldnt make a difference
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	where does easyubunty look for the architecture?
2006-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	do you have python installed?
2006-05-04T05:26:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	as i said, the app displays
2006-05-04T05:26:00.000Z	r0xoR	raptros-v76	it's got the logo and tabs, just nothing under the tabs
2006-05-04T05:28:00.000Z	raptros-v76	r0xoR	i need breakfast. im not thinking very clearly
