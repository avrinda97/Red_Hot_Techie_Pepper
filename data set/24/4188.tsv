2008-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	Thomas__		how can i make a mic port a speaker port?
2008-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	uhm, you can't.
2008-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	Thomas__		you can, because i booted into windows and did it very easily
2008-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	the hardware doesn't support it.
2008-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	Thomas__		obviously it does
2008-01-18T03:35:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	oh, hang on. Do you ahve one of those HDMA setups? Where the plugs can be rearranged?
2008-01-18T03:35:00.000Z	Thomas__		its onboard
2008-01-18T03:35:00.000Z	Thomas__	Viking667	is onboard audio with 6 ports
2008-01-18T03:36:00.000Z	Thomas__	Viking667	i did it in windows, so shouldnt i be able to in linux?
2008-01-18T03:37:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	yeah, sorry. I'm not used to the new audio setups.
2008-01-18T03:37:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	so I don't know HOW it can be done, nor even if it CAN be. I know my friend had a similar issue, don't know if he got it solved under Linux.
2008-01-18T03:37:00.000Z	Thomas__		ok does anyone know how to rearrange what ports are input and output with the alsa driver?
2008-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	Viking667	Thomas__	I'm more rather wondering if it's a way of modprobing?
2008-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	Viking667		i.e. if you look at the way the modules are loaded, and with what parameters?
2008-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	Thomas__		i dont know what modprobing is
2008-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	Viking667		!modprobe
2008-01-18T03:39:00.000Z	Viking667		hm. "modprobe" is a program that inserts kernel modules (i.e. points to hardware drivers, et al)
2008-01-18T03:39:00.000Z	Thomas__		hold on ill show you a screenshot of how it is in windows
2008-01-18T03:39:00.000Z	Viking667		Time I went, anyhow. It's getting madhouse 2.3 here.
2008-01-18T03:40:00.000Z	Thomas__		http://i10.tinypic.com/8anmfiv.png see how in windows i can change them
