2009-05-02T23:30:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	partimg
2009-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	sudo partimg [partitian1] [drive2]?
2009-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	you may have to install that program first. try man partimg or google. The program itself is quite easy to use (terminal, but menu oriented)
2009-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	cool, thanks
2009-05-02T23:33:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	there is a "linux rescue cd" with partimg on it somehwere on the web. You might want to burn on of those and boot it, instead of copying a "living" partition.
2009-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	nice program. When partimage creates an image, does it creat an image file that needs to be extracted, or does it directly copy the partitian?
2009-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	it can do both
2009-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	hmm, I wonder which one I did.
2009-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	I guess I'll know in 78 hours or so.
2009-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	just a little hint *giggles* think, _before_ you type
2009-05-02T23:54:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	Ok, that wasn't going to work... How do you copy a partitian directly to a new drive?
2009-05-02T23:54:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	i dont know by heart. Try the man page or look through the menus. SHouldnt be hard. You may have a problem, if the partition is already mounted, but I am not certain about this
2009-05-03T00:00:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	Ok, so, I have a 650+GB partitian I need to make into an image so that I can expell the image into another drive. The problem being that I only have about 884GB of free space.
2009-05-03T00:00:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	stand by, i will install partimg and look for myself
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	how did you install partimg?
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	(because i cant find it)
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	apt-get install partimg
2009-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	i have a freshly installed jaunty here, looks like i am missing some sources
2009-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	no problem, I'm trying to work it out with the dd command. Also, it may be apt-get install partimage
2009-05-03T00:07:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	dd is not perfect, since it copies empty sectors too. YOu might even get problems with different partition sizes, if you use dd. I wish you success!
2009-05-03T00:08:00.000Z	elexodus	hmw	I can't tell that it works at all. There are no empty sectors on the source disk.
2009-05-03T00:10:00.000Z	hmw	elexodus	just read the man page. Looks like partimage cannot directly copy between partitions. :/
