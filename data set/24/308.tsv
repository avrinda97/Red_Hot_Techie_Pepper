2011-12-08T12:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	when you installed ubuntu you wiped out MBR which was needed by windows, you need to fix windows first, with a rescue disk, google, repair MBR
2011-12-08T12:43:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	I run the windows system recovery and it finds no problems with the boot
2011-12-08T12:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	then all is well, windows is a boot option
2011-12-08T12:44:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	how can I get to windows then?

2011-12-08T12:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	does your cd include 'repair MBR'???
2011-12-08T12:50:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	no repair MBR
2011-12-08T13:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	now you got what you need to continue with grub repair till the cows come in
2011-12-08T13:18:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	I was just going to buy a second laptop!  Where would you go from here?
2011-12-08T13:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	if it'd 64bit, use 64bit, use the 'alternate' iso/disk and be connected to the internet via ethernet
2011-12-08T13:27:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	is this the right place to download from, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download
2011-12-08T13:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	assuming it's a 64bit machine and you want the 11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso.torrent
2011-12-08T13:29:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	it's an intel i7, an x86 chip.  It can run Win 64, so should be able to run Ubuntu 64?
2011-12-08T13:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	if it can run win64 then it's a 64bit machine, so 64bit ubuntu is the logical choice
2011-12-08T13:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	amd64=64bit
2011-12-08T13:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	insure you are connected to the internet on install via ethernet for best results
2011-12-08T13:38:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	one question - the file name AMD64 suggests that it's for an AMD chip, not an intel?
2011-12-08T13:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	its not, intel or amd
2011-12-08T13:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	I have never understood the reason myself, someone does not want to give intel credit????? anyway, my lappy is intel and it matters not to it
2011-12-08T13:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	there is one hitch, lets assume your lappy does not have 64bit virtualization, like mine, when you want to run 'virtual' software it will need to be 32bit,
2011-12-08T13:42:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	it does have hw virtualisation support.  Not sure that's an issue if I'm running dual boot?
2011-12-08T13:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	then if you choose to run virtual (virtualbox) either will work, 32 or 64 bit
2011-12-08T13:48:00.000Z	kimp	almoxarife	I'm off for dinner while the download happens.  Thanks again - you're a life saver!
2011-12-08T13:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	kimp	glad to help
