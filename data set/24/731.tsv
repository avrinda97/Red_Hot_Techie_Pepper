2011-02-20T04:15:00.000Z	AegisX		I was wondering... does anyone here use Evolution with a Gmail account? Do you find they interact well, with the labels and stars and archiving and such?
2011-02-20T04:15:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	I do, it works fine
2011-02-20T04:15:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	So IMAP works correctly etc?
2011-02-20T04:15:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	flawlessly :)
2011-02-20T04:16:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	I get mail notifications from evo before my iphone, so... Evo > apple?
2011-02-20T04:16:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Thank you; I'll synchronise them right now :)
2011-02-20T04:16:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	I use an Android phone, so that works well with Gmail. I've been thinking about synchronising everything, though, and Evolution seems to be a good way to do that.
2011-02-20T04:17:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	some people prefer thunderbird .. I personally don't care, don't need much from a mail client, just seperate my work and personal email and get it occasionally :)
2011-02-20T04:18:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	has some issues with html emails sometime. (doesn't render all the images)
2011-02-20T04:18:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	Im still talking, need tea, brb
2011-02-20T04:18:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Ah, didn't even think of Thunderbird... might have a look at that too. However, Evolution seems nicely integrated with Ubuntu's desktop.
2011-02-20T04:18:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Cool :)
2011-02-20T04:19:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	it is, but mozilla made thunderbird, lol, I haven't tried it, brb!!!
2011-02-20T04:21:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	I've never really used anything by Mozilla... I'm not a huge fan of Firefox hehe
2011-02-20T04:24:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	ImapX maintains a constant TCP connection to google, so its updated as soon as google is updated.
2011-02-20T04:24:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Oh, is that a plugin or a standard feature/
2011-02-20T04:25:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	standard, its whats the difference between pop and imap
2011-02-20T04:25:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Ah, nice. And does Evolution constantly run in the background?
2011-02-20T04:25:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	after you initially run it yes
2011-02-20T04:26:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	smtp is still used for outgoing mail though
2011-02-20T04:29:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	and pebblix: Just setting up Evolution now :)
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	And thanks to you, too :)
2011-02-20T04:39:00.000Z	Senjai	AegisX	:) Im in #ubuntu-offtopic if you need anything else
2011-02-20T04:40:00.000Z	AegisX	Senjai	Understood, thanks!
