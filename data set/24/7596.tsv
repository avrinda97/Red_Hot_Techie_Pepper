2005-09-19T09:30:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	Check if your CD-ROM is error-free.
2005-09-19T09:30:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	If you downloaded an ISO image, check the md5sum.
2005-09-19T09:30:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	md5sum <isoimage>
2005-09-19T09:41:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	There's plenty of windows tools if you google, I don't know what's good.
2005-09-19T09:41:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	Yes, you will find the list of md5sums for all the Ubuntu ISOs on the same server where you downloaded it, in the same directory.
2005-09-19T09:45:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	No, just the one for the ISO you downloaded.
2005-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	There should be a number on the same line as the file name of the iso you downloaded.
2005-09-19T09:48:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	run the md5sum program you downloaded on the iso, and compare it to that number.
2005-09-19T09:48:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	It's a windows program, so I'm clueless. Probably cd to the directory where you put it, and then just say whateveritscalled.exe
2005-09-19T09:49:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	no
2005-09-19T09:49:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	unless the iso happens to be on a partition on the same system that you can access from the install
2005-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	Then the image probably isn't on there?
2005-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/5.10/MD5SUMS
2005-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/5.04/MD5SUMS
2005-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	 depending on your release
2005-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	5.04 or 5.10?
2005-09-19T10:02:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	Might just be broken on your machine for some reason, after all it's still beta. What architecture?
2005-09-19T10:04:00.000Z	xTina	mkyb14	Good idea. If it turns out to be a problem with 5.10, maybe you can track it down.
