2008-09-14T04:02:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	I set up my own mail server on linux.  It's not worth it anymore (IMHO) unless it's for a large organization
2008-09-14T04:02:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	Why do you say that?
2008-09-14T04:02:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	There are too many spam hoops to jump through, and you have to do everything "just right" or your mail can get rejected by some servers.
2008-09-14T04:02:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	hmm
2008-09-14T04:03:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	Like, having a reverse dns lookup for your IP address is a big gotcha.  A lot of mail servers will drop you if your reverse dns lookup doesn't match the from domain.
2008-09-14T04:03:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	That could be bad
2008-09-14T04:04:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	And unless you have a hosted environment, a lot of spam blacklists automatically block all dsl and cable IP addresses
2008-09-14T04:04:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	And you have to appeal them to get yourself removed
2008-09-14T04:04:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	Damn
2008-09-14T04:04:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	I enjoyed learning about it, but it is a serious PITA to maintain
2008-09-14T04:05:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	Hmm. Is there any alternative to Blackberry Server yet?
2008-09-14T04:05:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	For a blackberry?
2008-09-14T04:05:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	No for a Treo. What else would a blackberry server do
2008-09-14T04:06:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	My wife has a treo, and we bought a Zimbra hosted account.  You can then use exchange activesync to sync mail/contacts/calendar
2008-09-14T04:06:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	I was asking if there was a free alternative to Blackberry Server
2008-09-14T04:06:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	Otherwise, you can get an IMAP account just about anywhere
2008-09-14T04:07:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	Zimbra does push e-mail like blackberry
2008-09-14T04:07:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	But there is no "open source blackberry server" that tries to emulate an actual blackberry server
2008-09-14T04:07:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	Ah thanks. SOmeone should do that
2008-09-14T04:08:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	If you are using a treo, you should seriously look at zimbra.  It works very similarly to a blackberry server
2008-09-14T04:08:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	That was sarcasm\
2008-09-14T04:08:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	lol... ok
2008-09-14T04:08:00.000Z	kapat	WDC	good luck then. ;-)
2008-09-14T04:08:00.000Z	WDC	kapat	lol.
