2007-05-13T07:28:00.000Z	digital_k		and save those also
2007-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	digital_k		ubuntu_ I have only used what comes with feisty thus far, so I have no knowledge really.
2007-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	digital_k		the included effects in feisty are compiz, very basic
2007-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	digital_k		hi CoAX
2007-05-13T07:30:00.000Z	digital_k		i dont believe that is in the 6.10 version
2007-05-13T07:30:00.000Z	imon9	digital_k	is there i jsut did the pakages backup thing u told... but i got a list of my installed pakages... when i reimport them, does it also help me uninstall those pakages that i not need?
2007-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	digital_k	imon9	it should install what you had and fix the rest I am guessing.
2007-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	imon9	digital_k	or is it better if i go it by installing ubuntu server version?
2007-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	digital_k		well do you need the server version?
2007-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	digital_k		are you going to run a server?
2007-05-13T07:31:00.000Z	digital_k		the desktop version should be ok unless you want a server setup
2007-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	digital_k		Koj did you make the cd yourself?
2007-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	imon9		no no...i just reckon that ubuntu server edition did not install all the application that coes with desktop version
2007-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	digital_k		you may want to check the cd for defects
2007-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	imon9		so i dont have to remove those application manually later
2007-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	digital_k		Ok so you have an 'official' dvd
2007-05-13T07:33:00.000Z	digital_k		what are the specs of your machine if i may ask , Koj?
2007-05-13T07:33:00.000Z	digital_k		hello jah13
