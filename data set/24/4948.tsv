2006-12-06T07:37:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	are you using AIGLX or XGL?
2006-12-06T07:37:00.000Z	cck	gribelu	well i suppose xgl ?! don't know what's the difference ?
2006-12-06T07:38:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	not sure but i think nvidia doesn't support AIGLX .. either :)

2006-12-06T07:45:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	actually.. seems that it might support AIGLX http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Beryl.2FAIGLX_.28Nvidia.29
2006-12-06T07:45:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	try the forums too.. they will help
2006-12-06T07:46:00.000Z	cck	gribelu	i've fooloowed the officiel howto, i guess something's wrong somewhere .. maybe the latest release ?
2006-12-06T07:48:00.000Z	cck	gribelu	i restart X with a new option in xorg, let's hope :p
2006-12-06T07:50:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	dunno about nvidia but there's nothing (pretty much) wrong on the ATI side.. and trust me, you're on the good side
2006-12-06T07:52:00.000Z	cck	gribelu	still crashing with 3 options in the xorg.conf :/
2006-12-06T07:54:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	no clues... sorry... i'm new to linux and i spent my last few weeks fixing ati hardware... so i don't think i can help
2006-12-06T07:54:00.000Z	gribelu	cck	all i can say is that the nice forums will get you there
