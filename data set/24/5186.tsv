2006-09-28T10:57:00.000Z	JacksLivr		question about partitions. there was a 47mb fat 16 and a 55gb ntfs... i added the swap and then i couldnt add any more primarys. i added an extended and put a logical 10gb ext3 for ubuntu install and another 40gb fat32 for common files. is that right?
2006-09-28T10:59:00.000Z	JacksLivr		is that right? im scared to death to hit enter
2006-09-28T11:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	It should work anyway.  "Right" is relative, depending on your needs.  I don't actually know if it matters, but I like to have my / on a primary partition, so if I were to do it, I'd switch the swap and root install.
2006-09-28T11:01:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	make the 10GB primary and put swap and fat32 in extended?
2006-09-28T11:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Yeah.
2006-09-28T11:03:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	ok, will it allow me to specify mount points later? i dont see them options yet
2006-09-28T11:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	They should be there now, but even if they're not, the only mount point you _need_ to specify now is /, everything else can be edited later, although it's easier now and should be there.
2006-09-28T11:05:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	no, no place to specify mount points
2006-09-28T11:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	All right, let's try to find them.  Hopefully I remember these screens.  What do you see now?
2006-09-28T11:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Maybe it does need to apply them before setting that.  Would make sense I suppose.  We'll see.
2006-09-28T11:08:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	ok, now it goes ther
2006-09-28T11:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Now it gives you the mount point option you mean?
2006-09-28T11:08:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	my windows partition is called /media/sda2 is that ok?
2006-09-28T11:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Sweet deal.  And yes, you can have it as whatever you want, theoretically.
2006-09-28T11:10:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	i appreciate your time tonight... my fat32 is not showing up in this emn. its the only one that isnt is thatok?
2006-09-28T11:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	It's not showing in the list at all?
2006-09-28T11:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	It might be worth backing up a step and trying adding it again, just for kicks, but it's not the complete end of the world otherwise, just addtional hassle.
2006-09-28T11:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Do you know what that other one was anyway?  Seemed odd to have such a small partition.
2006-09-28T11:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	Would you have proper backups for the Windows stuff if you totally fried it?  (Not saying you're doing so, just checking)
2006-09-28T11:17:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	i do have all my data backed up
2006-09-28T11:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	There you go, then you won't be in trouble :)
2006-09-28T11:20:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	what i wanna try... when this all working i wanna put vmware on the ubuntu install and create a virtual machine that uses the windows partition. then i can fire it up whenever i need to do anuything in windows and suspend it when i dont need it.
2006-09-28T11:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JacksLivr	That's a sweet idea, but as soon as you get into that you'll have to find someone else for help ;)
2006-09-28T12:32:00.000Z	JacksLivr	tonyyarusso	thanks for all your help. windows and ubuntu both work. I  have a long way to go to get ubuntu working well.... but the repartition and install worked. thanks again for all your help... gnight
