2011-05-06T16:02:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Woah dirty computer 169!  That's my iMac's IP address!  How do i fix that?  i already tried to change the cable!
2011-05-06T16:02:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	use a DHCP service or static IPs
2011-05-06T16:03:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	But this is Ubuntu!  It's supposed t owork!
2011-05-06T16:03:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	My computers didn't 169 until Ubuntu 11.04!
2011-05-06T16:04:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	it does, avail will allow you to publish resources over the local network without static IPs or a DHCP server, but if you want something more, you need more configuration
2011-05-06T16:04:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	i have an Android.  Internet works on Ubuntu and Android.  i have an iMac.  Internet doesn't work on iMac.  It says 169.  What do i do?  It worked in 10.10 and below!
2011-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	how to the different computers connect to the network/internet?
2011-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	It's a direct cable between the Ubuntu laptop and the iMac.
2011-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	then you need to share the internet connection
2011-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	Smartphone <---> Ubuntu <---> iMac
2011-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	you share the connection from ubuntu to with the mac
2011-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	Yeah.  There's an Ethernet connection from Android to Ubuntu.  Then there's another Ethernet connection (Shared with other computers) from Ubuntu to iMac.  The iMac says 169.  What do i do?
2011-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	so your ubuntu system has 3 network interfaces?
2011-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	two.  One is Android, the other is iMac.
2011-05-06T16:09:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	then how does the ubuntu system connect to the internet?
2011-05-06T16:09:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	With the smartphone.
2011-05-06T16:10:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	then you need follow the internet connection sharing guide to share the connection to the smart phone from the ubuntu system with the mac
2011-05-06T16:11:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	but i did!  It wasn't an issue until 11.04
2011-05-06T16:12:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	no version of ubuntu ever automatically bridged interfaces, you have to set that up yourself
2011-05-06T16:13:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	my Ubuntu computer has 10.*.*.*!
2011-05-06T16:13:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	10.* didn't do it either, you're basically setting up your ubuntu system as a router. that's not automatic
2011-05-06T16:14:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	What should i do?
2011-05-06T16:20:00.000Z	tsimpson	LetsGo67	read through https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
2011-05-06T16:22:00.000Z	LetsGo67	tsimpson	but i did!
