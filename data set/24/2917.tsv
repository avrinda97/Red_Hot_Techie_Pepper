2008-06-27T01:25:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	there are plenty of ssh clients supporting it
2008-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	mwoehlke	beli	Ubuntu doesn't enable sftp by default?
2008-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	it is enabled by default, but he wanted to know where to checkout :)
2008-06-27T01:26:00.000Z	mwoehlke	beli	ok :-)
2008-06-27T01:27:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	in my eyes some stuff should be disabled by default, but ok, ubuntus main aim is not security ;)
2008-06-27T01:29:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	you can use puttys sftp too
2008-06-27T01:29:00.000Z	mwoehlke	beli	never used putty :-)

2008-06-27T01:32:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	yeah, why not?

2008-06-27T01:42:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	why not just try to start it? ;)
2008-06-27T01:42:00.000Z	mwoehlke	beli	er, if he wants it to start next reboot...
2008-06-27T01:42:00.000Z	beli	mwoehlke	that was next step ;) i just wanted to checkout if it is installed
