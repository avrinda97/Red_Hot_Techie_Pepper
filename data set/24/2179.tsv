2009-11-08T20:55:00.000Z	Paulo39		hi, i'm having problems with my login screen. i'm on ubuntu 9.10 and i have a login screen from xubuntu, and i cant change it! Can you help me please?
2009-11-08T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 so it still works.. just looks different. so? :)  theres a tool called 'epidermis' i saw the other day on a site that can tweak/change the login screen themes and other themes also.
2009-11-08T21:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 that unofficial program 'epidermis' can change those settings/files with just a few clicks if you really want to change them ---> http://epidermis.tuxfamily.org/
2009-11-08T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 i got some bug with epidermis on this box now..  not ssure whats going on with it. :)  its a neat tool.
2009-11-08T21:34:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	ok, anyway, is not a big problem for me. now i am surprised with this bad performance on start-up
2009-11-08T21:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 i never upgrade.. only clean insttalls.. and i get 2+ week uptimes on my machines.. so a extra 30 sec to boot.. means nothing to me. ;)
2009-11-08T21:35:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	how do you safe all your apps and configurations when you make a clean install?
2009-11-08T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 i backup my home to a usb drive or keep it on its own parittion..  and i save what few configs i need also..
2009-11-08T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 i just reinstall the apps.
2009-11-08T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 easier to do it under linux then it is under winows by 1000000x
2009-11-08T21:37:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	yes, its easier
2009-11-08T21:39:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	i would like to have  a separate partition with my home, do you know how can i do that now? or it's really suggested to just do that on a clean install?
2009-11-08T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 find a partitio/drive somewhere.. move home files over to it. mount it to /home in /etc/fstab
2009-11-08T21:41:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	i'l see that, thanks
2010-03-06T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 you have todo a little work
2010-03-06T16:55:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	what work do i have to do?
2010-03-18T16:21:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	ok, thanks
2010-07-18T01:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 where did the .wmas come from? it could be some sort of DRM on them.
2010-07-18T01:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 you could try playing themn in vlc. from command line, look for any error messages
2010-07-18T01:39:00.000Z	Paulo39	Dr_Willis	how can i check for the DRM? i don't have vlc installed, is there other way?
2010-07-18T01:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 No idea. I rarely if ever even see a wma file.
2010-07-18T01:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 you could try playing it with gmplayer, or totem from the command line and look for error messages also
2010-07-18T01:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 ffprobe also might be able to give some info on the file
2010-07-18T01:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Paulo39	 from what i am 'translating' 'stream is encrypted' - so YES. its got some DRM on it.
