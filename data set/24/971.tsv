2012-02-11T15:20:00.000Z	Stelpa		hullo!
2012-02-11T15:20:00.000Z	Stelpa		i, uhm, seem to have screwed things up :S
2012-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	oCean	Stelpa	you have to give the channel some details...
2012-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	Stelpa		anyone willing to help me right this screw up; there is a catch, which is, i do not recall at all what i did to make this happen....
2012-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	oCean	Stelpa	start describing your issue in the channel, all in one line
2012-02-11T15:22:00.000Z	Stelpa		but, uhm, yeah; in my file browser (in my screenshot, looking for an album to play) it lists "sdb1" along with 2, 3, and 4 as file systems / storage... i have no idea what this means. When i try to click on one, an error message pops up about it being unable to mount.

2012-02-11T15:22:00.000Z	Stelpa		it's bizarre, i must have done this long ago and not noticed until recently...
2012-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	Stelpa		btw, wendy is a harddrive named after wendy carlos :-)
2012-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	Stelpa	jetole	i did, that isn't the issue; these objects on the menu (sdb1 through 4) are useless and bugged...
2012-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	oCean	Stelpa	the sdX devices are disk partitions
2012-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	Stelpa		they are?
2012-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	Stelpa		well, they aren't supposed to be there, i dont think :s
2012-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	Stelpa	jetole	i have tried this; both options (remove and rename) are "grayed out" and unclickable (i will screenshot if you need to see)
2012-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	Stelpa		k!
2012-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	Stelpa		ty for helping me btw :)
2012-02-11T15:27:00.000Z	Stelpa		okey, screenshot:

2012-02-11T15:29:00.000Z	Stelpa	jetole	there are no menu items at the top...
2012-02-11T15:30:00.000Z	Stelpa	jetole	ok, i did that; nothing seems to have changed :(
2012-02-11T15:31:00.000Z	Stelpa		:X
2012-02-11T15:31:00.000Z	Stelpa		uhm, this is linux mint... their help channel is currently busy/incapable of helping, so i hope you wont mind that i tried going here because of the similarity of the two...
2012-02-11T15:31:00.000Z	Stelpa		:(
2012-02-11T15:32:00.000Z	oCean	Stelpa	nope, mint is one of the derivatives we cannot support here
