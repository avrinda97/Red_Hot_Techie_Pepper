2010-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Fuyang: you'll need either a plugin or a script/binary to tell the browser to run it with
2010-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	fuyang	ActionParsnip	what plugin. right now the TomeMoviePlayer shows up on the page but can not play mms
2010-05-14T10:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bdunn: you could create a very simple bash script to run from a CD. You could even use the customise live cd to put the script on the install cd itself
2010-05-14T10:27:00.000Z	fuyang		ActionParsnip:totem player*, typed wrong just now
2010-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryanyt: install a local dns and look into tweaking /etc/sysctl.conf . You can also disable ipv6 to get a tiny bit more speed maybe (assuming you don't use it)
2010-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Fuyang: I'll assume you use crappy firefox: http://www.google.com/m?hl=en&gl=gb&client=ms-android-tmobile&source=android-browser-key&q=mms+in+firefox
2010-05-14T10:29:00.000Z	fuyang		ActionParnip : oh really? Thanks a lot. let me take a look

2010-05-14T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: opendns is still on the www. Using dnsmasq will make name resolves take 0ms rather than about 50ms
2010-05-14T10:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: I use 127.0.0.1 then the ones from my provider
2010-05-14T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: there are lots of tweaks if you use firefox to use more pipelines etc. There are guides all over for it

2010-05-14T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: it's also sysctl.conf not sysctI.con as you said
2010-05-14T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	find out your video chip / lappy mayke & model then see if there are some tweaks you need to do. Hiberante can be a REAL pain to get nice so expect some heartache and tears.
2010-05-14T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	same deal for the guides dude. You can find your video card with: lspci | grep -i vga
2010-05-14T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: read the output you will see why its slow.
2010-05-14T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	better than you thought ;)
2010-05-14T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bryant: you need to read guides for iwconfig to set the rate the 54M
2010-05-14T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obscurant1st	you may need some power settings adding, or some module options. It can be loads of things. The web will tell you. There may also be a guide for your model on www.laptoplinux.com

2010-05-14T11:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Gogeta: I changed mine last night using a different driver for bootup
2010-05-14T11:08:00.000Z	fuyang	ActionParsnip	sudo apt-get install gecko-mediaplayer -- this one helped me.
