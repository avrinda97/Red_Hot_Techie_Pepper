2005-09-21T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	because 2.6.8 is humourlys old
2005-09-21T13:05:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	but should you still not have it in the repositry?
2005-09-21T13:06:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	why would you want to have old kernels there?
2005-09-21T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	yes, it's simple
2005-09-21T13:08:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	I know it might be simple
2005-09-21T13:08:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	remove libgtk2.0
2005-09-21T13:08:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	but that's probably not what you want, so you need to define "remove gnome" more strictly
2005-09-21T13:09:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	can I see a screen shot of your desktop?
2005-09-21T13:10:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	it's the default gnome with 10 desktops of xterms, one of firefox and one of emacs

2005-09-21T13:19:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	you have anything against software raid?
2005-09-21T13:19:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	why did you say that?
2005-09-21T13:20:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	no, software raid is fine; I have something against shitty promise and sil "hardware" raid that require kernel drivers
2005-09-21T13:21:00.000Z	aethera	bob2	why did you say you are not for rent
2005-09-21T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	aethera	I said I am for rent, in reference to you asking what I did
