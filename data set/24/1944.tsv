2009-06-13T02:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	dom96	what video card do you use and driver?

2009-06-13T02:23:00.000Z	dom96		and i'm not sure which driver
2009-06-13T02:23:00.000Z	dom96		how can i check ?
2009-06-13T02:24:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	?
2009-06-13T02:25:00.000Z	ctmjr	dom96	type this in terminal egrep "Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-06-13T02:25:00.000Z	dom96		ctmjr:(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers//fglrx_drv.so
2009-06-13T02:26:00.000Z	dom96		that's what i got
2009-06-13T02:27:00.000Z	dom96		ctmjr:well ?
2009-06-13T02:28:00.000Z	dom96		ctmjr:k i think i got the driver version, 8.6
2009-06-13T02:29:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	any ideas ?
2009-06-13T02:30:00.000Z	ctmjr	dom96	it is almost impossible to get tear free video with the fglrx driver you can try the radeon xorg driver but you will not have 3d
2009-06-13T02:31:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	are you sure, couse i've seen on forums, some kind of command that you can type into th terminal
2009-06-13T02:31:00.000Z	dom96		but it doesn't work for me
2009-06-13T02:33:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	sudo aticonfig --sync-vsync=on
2009-06-13T02:33:00.000Z	dom96		that's the one
2009-06-13T02:34:00.000Z	ctmjr		dom96,you can ask in the #ati channel i do not use the fglrx driver for that reason
2009-06-13T02:35:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	i guess i'll try the xorg driver
2009-06-13T02:36:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	will i still be able to go back to fglrx ?
2009-06-13T02:37:00.000Z	ctmjr		dom96,you need to remove it to use the xorg driver but if you do not like it you can reinstall the fglrx driver
2009-06-13T02:38:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	thanks a lot i'll ask the people on #ati first and see what they think
2009-06-13T02:38:00.000Z	ctmjr	dom96	that would be best as i said i gave up on it so maybe they fixed it.
2009-06-13T02:38:00.000Z	dom96	ctmjr	ok thanks a lot
