2011-11-12T13:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	you want a hd mounted on booting?
2011-11-12T13:31:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	i have windows , ubuntu 11.04 and ubuntu 10.04 and i want this hd mounted when i startup my ubuntu 11.04
2011-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok but which is the comand to insert  in the start gui programs?
2011-11-12T13:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	you don't do it that way if you want partiions mounted it is fstab.
2011-11-12T13:39:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok from the  start gui programs i will search the site or comand to do it
2011-11-12T13:41:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	search /etc/fstab from start gui programs ?
2011-11-12T13:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	I think you don't understand startup applications has nothing to do with having partitions mounted on the computer automatically it is a fstab job
2011-11-12T13:45:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok i dont understand but i will to try from start gui programs , search /etc/fstab, because is easier for me
2011-11-12T13:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	what is start gui programs?
2011-11-12T13:47:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	if you want startup with compiz you must have compiz in the startup gui programs of ubntu
2011-11-12T13:48:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	is only a example
2011-11-12T13:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	it is startup applications no gui in there, what you want is a partition mounted correct?
2011-11-12T13:49:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok of course
2011-11-12T13:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	great that is done by adding the correct lines in fstab, not the startup manager we can help you here if we are on the same page.
2011-11-12T13:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	startup applications manager thatbs.
2011-11-12T13:51:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	whats thatbs?
2011-11-12T13:53:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok was an error but i wanted the comand to insert in the gui
2011-11-12T13:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	tlk16	it doesn't work that way I give up good luck./
2011-11-12T13:57:00.000Z	tlk16	urlin2u	ok another time will be....
