2007-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486		OK everybody, I have a new problem with my Live CD; when I reconfigured my BIOS to run the CD first and the HDD LAST, it starts up with this message: Non-system disk, press any key..._
2007-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	dirty disk?
2007-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486		i don't think so
2007-05-15T05:29:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	did you md5 it?
2007-05-15T05:29:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	what do you mean, md5 it?
2007-05-15T05:29:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	the ISO image, did you run a checksum?
2007-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	or is it a CD you had delivered?
2007-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	It's a CD i burned myself after downloading the 6.06 ISO
2007-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	did you run a checksum on the ISO then?
2007-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	I have no idea what thatis
2007-05-15T05:31:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	it checks your dload isn't corrupt
2007-05-15T05:31:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	I had no problem with the download when I got it...
2007-05-15T05:31:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	yeah but it might be wrong, if it's saying it's not a system disk that means it's not got the right data on it
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	I extracted it right from the ISO with WinRAR and burned it to a CD
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	should I try version 7?
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	there's your problem -_- use something like NERO to burn it using the ISO
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	I used the standard Windows burning wizard
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	you said you extracted it
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	you shouldn't have
2007-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	right, extracted the data and burned it to a CD
2007-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	you're not supposed to do it like that, you're supposed to put the ISO directly ON the cd
2007-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	using a burning prog that can "burn from image"
2007-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	WolfODonnel486	yoda	but when I insert the Live CD while the computer's already running, it works perfectly
2007-05-15T05:34:00.000Z	yoda	WolfODonnel486	it's not burnt the boot code it's only burnt the files
