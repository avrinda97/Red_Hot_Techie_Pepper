2007-09-20T05:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		Im going to use Virtual Box to install M$ XP if i pull this off I shouldn't need to dual boot any more, however how much Ram should I assign to XP? Ive got 2GB and 1GB swap for ubuntu so how much of that can i give to XP?
2007-09-20T05:51:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	give it 700 if you want a random but reasonable number
2007-09-20T05:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	bascule: 0o You're being serious? XP runs on like 256 minimum dont know how well that is when using virtaul box but why 700-768 Ram? isin't that a tad toooo much?
2008-10-24T01:12:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	it will create as many as you tell it
2008-10-24T01:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	ok just making sure the command was right
2008-10-24T01:13:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	well, in the command you gave, you put spaces where none belong
2008-10-24T01:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	yah but i thought i need spaces im creating three folder or more in the same directory, if not how would i do it, do i have to cd into the actual directory?
2008-10-24T01:15:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	no, you just type mkdir /media/foldername1 /media/foldername2 /media/foldername3
2008-10-24T01:15:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	which is not what you typed above
2008-10-24T01:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	that is so true didnt notice that was an error but thanx for spotting it
2008-10-24T01:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	ahh got beaten to it and in fashion
2008-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	looks more or less ok to me, i'm not so familiar with fstab and mount options to say "it's perfect", though
2008-10-24T01:42:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	that is what i also think but will try it out now, is there a way i can make fstab refresh without restarting my system?
2008-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	mount -a
2008-10-24T01:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	erUSUL: thank you
2008-11-27T19:04:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	will look at it
2009-03-04T23:23:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	amsn possibly, but i'm not sure
2009-03-04T23:23:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	i ahve amsn but can't get voice chat, just find it too hard
2009-03-04T23:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	do you know of anyother apps that could do the job
2009-09-19T01:43:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	no, but i'm pretty sure Ctrl+G will list it
2009-09-19T01:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	I did check that but what key would be M-/?
2009-09-19T01:44:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	Alt + whatever key combo you need to use to type /
2009-09-19T01:45:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	LjL	I did it gives me - everytime
2009-09-19T01:45:00.000Z	LjL	Pirate_Hunter	-?
