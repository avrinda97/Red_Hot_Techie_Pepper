2008-06-05T17:58:00.000Z	Mattz		no. it's too old a motherboard
2008-06-05T17:58:00.000Z	Mattz		this is literally the only option available to me
2008-06-05T17:58:00.000Z	Mattz		No
2008-06-05T18:00:00.000Z	Mattz		p3 650mhz 256ram 20gb hdd
2008-06-05T18:01:00.000Z	Mattz		so i'm told anyway
2008-06-05T18:03:00.000Z	Mattz		*doesn't
2008-06-05T18:04:00.000Z	Mattz		Oh yeah. This has been my spare time, self inflicted suffering project for six months. Finally get this far and the distro I was gonna use as a basepoint is too obsolete to get it going
2008-06-05T18:04:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	it doesent support cd boot?
2008-06-05T18:04:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	kus if it does maybe you should test the hardware to make sure its not buggy.
2008-06-05T18:05:00.000Z	Mattz	chamunks	I don't have a usb or PCMIA drive to use. Nothing but a USB floppy
2008-06-05T18:05:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	and you cant netboot?!!? wow...
2008-06-05T18:06:00.000Z	Mattz	chamunks	i can NEARLY netboot. I just need a better set of floppies that support a distro later than breezy
2008-06-05T18:07:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	ill see what i can search up for ya, i just had a bit of a crash course in net boot recently.
2008-06-05T18:07:00.000Z	Mattz	chamunks	cool. give me a minute while i go find the original guide i was using. maybe the author has a more up to date guide somewhere
2008-06-05T18:09:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	peitchie has a point usb drives are way better but if the only problem is the version of ubuntu your using it seems like just a matter of finding the more recent version net boot floppies
2008-06-05T18:16:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	looking into it 1 min
2008-06-05T18:18:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	to be honnest i believe that the release cd's for each distro contain boot.img's for that perticular release
2008-06-05T18:22:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	im looking at one of the cd's i have but yeah you should be able to get them in any of the dists
2008-06-05T18:25:00.000Z	Mattz	chamunks	I've got a 7.10 xubuntu disc which I can pop the files out of. the only problem is that it's far larger than a standard floppy. could it be split across them?
2008-06-05T18:26:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	it should be maybe ask around ill keep looking kus i wouldnt mind knowing how to do this myself i have a few machines with similar situations.
2008-06-05T18:26:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	besides i kindof prefer netboot rather than wasting disks all the time.
2008-06-05T18:27:00.000Z	Mattz	chamunks	ta dude, I'm gonna go do a bit of digging then, poke me if you find something
2008-06-05T18:28:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	will do
2008-06-05T18:41:00.000Z	chamunks	Mattz	aye this page should solve everything https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
