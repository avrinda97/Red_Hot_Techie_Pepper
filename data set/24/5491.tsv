2006-07-21T08:22:00.000Z	BSoDirl		stuff like this makes me hate printers
2006-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	BSoDirl		i probably need all the gnome-print stuff
2006-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	BSoDirl		*sigh*
2006-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	what's your problem?
2006-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	is CUPS installed?
2006-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	'dpkg -l | grep -i cups'
2006-07-21T08:25:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	'lpstat -t'
2006-07-21T08:26:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	in a command line, type 'lpstat -t'... you must see something like 'scheduler is running'
2006-07-21T08:27:00.000Z	BSoDirl	kikinovak	i saw that, but then it said "no system default destination"
2006-07-21T08:28:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	'/etc/init.d/cupsys status'... what does that give?
2006-07-21T08:29:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	you familiar with setting up CUPSA
2006-07-21T08:30:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	google for "linux cookbook carla schroder"... chapter 14 is about CUPS... very well explained... it's a sample download from O'Reilly... grab the PDF and read it, and then you'll enjoy setting up your printer
2006-07-21T08:31:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	I've just setup a printer server on Ubuntu Server:oD
2006-07-21T08:31:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	Also check for System > help > Ubuntu Server... there's a page about CUPS that looks well documented
2006-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	I've always been a Slackware user before... where things *never* work out of the box... excellent school
2006-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	BSoDirl	kikinovak	freebsd/netbsd here, but they were easier than this crap
2006-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	ah you don't have the doc files installed. Well, they're all available on help.ubuntu.com.
2006-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	there's a peculiar default setup with Ubuntu's cupsd.conf. Listen is limited to localhost.
2006-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	best thing IMHO is start a new cupsd.conf from scratch.
2006-07-21T08:34:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	go read the Cookbook Chapter... it's 10 pages, no more. And it teaches you everything you have to know about CUPS.
2006-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	take several glasses of whisky, indulge a bit in self-pitying... and tomorrow morning, learn about CUPS, and then be a man (or a woman?) and configure this thing by hand
2006-07-21T08:38:00.000Z	BSoDirl	kikinovak	booze just makes everyone dumber...
2006-07-21T08:51:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	sorry was away few min
2006-07-21T08:52:00.000Z	kikinovak	BSoDirl	what printer btw?
