2005-08-06T06:01:00.000Z	DeltaF		Is ubuntu suitable for a fileserver?
2005-08-06T06:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	yes
2005-08-06T06:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	both Ubuntu and Debian are useful as servers
2005-08-06T06:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	most of the Ubuntu specific work has been desktop stuff
2005-08-06T06:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	they are the ones who seriously hacked the filesystem?
2005-08-06T06:12:00.000Z	DeltaF	Burgundavia	With an abundance of links, yes. :)
2005-08-06T06:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	the key thing to remember is Mac OS X has a standard Unix file system
2005-08-06T06:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	changing the names of folders does nothing, IMHO
2005-08-06T06:13:00.000Z	DeltaF	Burgundavia	Tell your parent to click on /usr/local/sbin/ or /Programs. :)
2005-08-06T06:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	the user should never see the underlying filesystem
2005-08-06T06:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	changing the name doesn't fix that bug
2005-08-06T06:14:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	no, I tell my parents to plug in the camera and follow the dialogs
2005-08-06T06:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	you can make the system completely usable without breaking the file system
2005-08-06T06:17:00.000Z	DeltaF	Burgundavia	Not if a general user EVER has the need to look at the file structure.
2005-08-06T06:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	the user looking at the underlying filesystem is a bug
2005-08-06T06:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	as I said, there are easier and better backwards compatible ways to fix it
2005-08-06T06:18:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	what does?
2005-08-06T06:19:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	what is boils down to is that breaking the file system is not an overall win
2005-08-06T06:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	yes it is
2005-08-06T06:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	because you can always access it, if you want to
2005-08-06T06:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	what you consider redundant?
2005-08-06T06:21:00.000Z	DeltaF	Burgundavia	/bin, /usr/bin
2005-08-06T06:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	there are very good reasons for seperating thme
2005-08-06T06:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	DeltaF	I suggest you read about why the various binaries are seperated into 4 different dirs
