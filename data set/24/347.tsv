2011-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	gunztunz		how do i get rid of upstart in ubuntu and replace it with something saner?
2011-11-03T11:08:00.000Z	gunztunz		fucking retards
2011-11-03T11:08:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	stop it
2011-11-03T11:10:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	thats not the fault of ubuntu or any other distro
2011-11-03T11:11:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	sure you can but that is not a good/clean solution i think
2011-11-03T11:12:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	there was a bug for that
2011-11-03T11:12:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	let me have a look
2011-11-03T11:14:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	hm at the morning my search-foo is very bad but i am 100% sure there is a bug for exactly that issue
2011-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	and if i am correct it was the result that it would be fixed in 12.04
2011-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	or better, it would be checked to integrate that feature in 12.04
2011-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	10.04 is (imo) not using upstart
2011-11-03T11:16:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	or a misc between both methods
2011-11-03T11:16:00.000Z	gunztunz	iceroot	are you talking about this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/ifupdown/+bug/497299
2011-11-03T11:17:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	hm, i know i was adding me as a affected person (but the search is not showing it under my bugs) that is not the bug i mean
2011-11-03T11:19:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	launchpad is down now :(
2011-11-03T11:19:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	but the topic was a debug-system for upstart
2011-11-03T11:19:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	search is giving me timeouts atm
2011-11-03T11:23:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	yes that should be possible now, the bug i mean was a default-debug-system for upstart and controlling on failed events
2011-11-03T11:23:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	e.g. apparmor should be using upstart at the moment and its spawning my tty1 completly with error-messages, so using tty1 should be possible for other scripts too
2011-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	gunztunz	iceroot	?
2011-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	your issue is that upstart is not showing the status at boot? or that your scripts are not able to write to the shell at boot?
2011-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	ok, to change that there is the bug i mentioned (and not found at the moment)
2011-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	yes, that would be a fix for 11.10 or 12.04 (maybe a backport is possible)
2011-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	iceroot	gunztunz	maybe #ubuntu-devel is better for that
