2008-01-16T19:18:00.000Z	Ntemis		hello ppl
2008-01-16T19:19:00.000Z	Ntemis		i want to install latest scummvm but all i can find is etch package
2008-01-16T19:19:00.000Z	Ntemis		and i cannot install echt on gutsy
2008-01-16T19:19:00.000Z	Ntemis		can i?
2008-01-16T19:20:00.000Z	Ntemis		here it is
2008-01-16T19:20:00.000Z	Ntemis		http://scummvm.sourceforge.net/downloads.php
2008-01-16T19:20:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	actually, the Etch package is the same version as the Ubuntu package.
2008-01-16T19:20:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	ah, you mean the one on the site.
2008-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	the Etch package may work, but no guarantees. you might find yourself with broken packages (which can be quite a nuisance).
2008-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	perhaps, if you can settle for version 0.10 instead of 0.11 (since 0.10 is what is in Hardy), then you can request a backport
2008-01-16T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	is there a specific reason why you need that version?
2008-01-16T19:28:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	let me attempt to patch that package to work with Gutsy. NO GUARANTEES about it, however.
2008-01-16T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	i'll put it somewhere... let me see if it's actually *possible* to patch it, for starters
2008-01-16T19:30:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	how would we know? ask them.
2008-01-16T19:33:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	actually, that package installs and starts fine "out of the box". how did you attempt to install it?
2008-01-16T19:35:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	try « sudo apt-get install libflac7 » and then try again
2008-01-16T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	then yes, there is probably something with your repositories. pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-01-16T19:38:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	ah, no, wait... *i* have libflac7 installed from "somewhere" for some reason.
2008-01-16T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	i don't know, i don't have the repository (whichever it is) enabled anymore, so i can't see where it was installed from. let me investigate
2008-01-16T19:40:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	ah, you see, the thing is that Gutsy comes with libflac8. my libflac7 package is probably a leftover from Feisty... which, however, should mean that the Feisty package is pretty Gutsy-compatible (still no guarantees, just reasoning).
2008-01-16T19:41:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	the Feisty package can be downloaded at http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/flac/libflac7_1.1.2-5ubuntu2.1_i386.deb
2008-01-16T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	oh, i think i've upgraded from an Edgy install originally
2008-01-16T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	no, that would be "apt-get upgrade", and still, that's not the recommended way to upgrade. anyway...
2008-01-16T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	Ntemis	you try installing that flac package i gave you, and then you try again your scummvm package.
