2010-10-27T22:05:00.000Z	tripelb		Opinion/Suggestion for UbuntuL (sorry but I may never figure out the "official" channel for suggestions) Re Audio Gain control on the Panel. viz: I'd like (an option of?) + and - buttons to click. Or once vol. is opened a way to go by stages. (I'd like it vertical to but that's not what this comment is about.) As it is not it is difficult to control. It goes HIGH too easily. I may want to keep it quiet for friends in the room. Right n
2010-10-27T22:05:00.000Z	tripelb		ow I do not even have the option to mute it then adjust it. MUTE it, It might help to have numbers on it so I can set a level I have liked before. I'd like to mute it with one click. Altogether it's considerably less sophisticated/comfortable/useful than I would like,less friendly/harmonious too. THanks for listening. I'd like Ubuntu to be easier to use. THis is a surface property but another one that could be a deal-breaker.

2010-10-27T22:07:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	then what's the point of avast.  she_dyed oh yes I do. With pleasure. And on toast.
2010-12-15T03:44:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 try changing your accessibility settings
2010-12-15T03:45:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	er,  Syst> Prefs > Assistive Technologies
2010-12-15T03:46:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 hm, pretty sure there was an option in there to make text larger system-wide ... guess they omitted it ?
2010-12-15T03:50:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 System > Preferences > Appearance > Fonts
2010-12-15T03:50:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 yes, a microsoft owned font to make fonts look better in microsoft windows :P
2010-12-15T03:51:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	are you telling me to go to fonts to make my fonts bigger? That's exactly what I have to do now. I used windows (for a guest) and was amazed that I could read the small text.
2010-12-15T03:52:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	then are there any fonts in ubuntu that I can read small?  this is terrible. I use my large monitor like a small monitor only its' heavier and takes more electricity.
2010-12-15T03:54:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	a font is no different big than it is small, except siez of course, the font you like and can see best is up to you.  it may also be application specific.
2010-12-15T03:54:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 ie, different sizes in ff than in gnome
2010-12-27T23:18:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 also man du
2010-12-27T23:22:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	- thanks. And that reminds me, there's something  -h   that I have used but forgot. If you remind me I'd get even happier.
2010-12-27T23:24:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	- amazing. I looked in the terminal history. First I went back a long time, them started looking and foundit it!!  df -h
2010-12-27T23:26:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 the -h command is common among many apps, and pretty much stands for "human readable".. ps -h, du -h, df -h, etc
2010-12-27T23:26:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	thanks.  (I found http://www.watchingthenet.com/ubuntu-guide-for-windows-users-how-to-check-hard-drive-disk-space.html)
2010-12-27T23:26:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	 df -h might be more what you're looking for
2010-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	goltoof	tripelb	  coolio
2010-12-27T23:27:00.000Z	tripelb	goltoof	thanks.
