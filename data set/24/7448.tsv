2004-12-21T14:19:00.000Z	lil_anthony		i don't have it
2004-12-21T14:19:00.000Z	lil_anthony		i thougth so i installed openssh
2004-12-21T14:19:00.000Z	lil_anthony		is it not included with that
2004-12-21T14:19:00.000Z	lil_anthony		so its /etc/init.d/openssh?
2004-12-21T14:20:00.000Z	lil_anthony		sorry i'm new to this trying to figure out how to launch my apps remotely for fun
2004-12-21T14:20:00.000Z	lil_anthony		file not found
2004-12-21T14:20:00.000Z	lil_anthony		hmm i just installed it from the repository :(
2004-12-21T14:21:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	apt-get install openssh-server
2004-12-21T14:22:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	are you on warty or hoary?
2004-12-21T14:29:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	you must have an apt-get install or something somewhere that hasn't quit
2004-12-21T14:31:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	look for dpkg, apt, dselect, aptitude, or even another instance of synaptic
2004-12-21T14:42:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	that's fucked up.  for a fast reboot do a sudo shutdown -f now, then when you get the # just hit ctrl-d
2004-12-21T14:45:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	you need openssh-server though
2004-12-21T14:49:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	if it's saying "do you want to connect anyway", just say yes
2004-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	I think y ou must know more about the actual use of ssh than I do because I have no idea what you're talking about =(
2004-12-25T14:04:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	to use fsck I believe the filesystem needs to be mounted as read only
2004-12-25T14:05:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	you need to fsck / ?
2004-12-25T14:07:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	sudo `shutdown -F now' I believe
2004-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	running warty?
2004-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	oh, from what you had said before it sounded like you had automatic login enabled
2004-12-29T07:30:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	have you installed flux?  last I knew it wasn't in warty
2004-12-29T07:38:00.000Z	farruinn	lil_anthony	I think you're right - ~/.xsession
