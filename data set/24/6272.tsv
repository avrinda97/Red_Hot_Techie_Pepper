2005-12-10T06:55:00.000Z	BigKahuna		Anybody using the V4L driver with ubuntu?
2005-12-10T06:55:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	is there *the* V4L driver? I thought it's a library...
2005-12-10T06:57:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Actually, that what I was hoping someone could explain for me.
2005-12-10T06:57:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	I think V4L is a library, and drivers (e.g. for tv-cards or webcams) are written compliant to that library
2005-12-10T06:58:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	I have been tinkering with my PVR card and finally have it working with the IVTV driver. Then I here about V4L, all I can figure out from the official wiki is that it is an API. Which doesnt really help me.
2005-12-10T06:59:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	haven't you found any tutorial for your PVR card?
2005-12-10T06:59:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	and what's IVTV?
2005-12-10T07:00:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	maybe your IVTV is a V4L driver?
2005-12-10T07:00:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Yes I found a HowTo, IVTV project to develop drivers specifically for my type of PVR card (hauppauge).
2005-12-10T07:01:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	ivtvdriver.org?
2005-12-10T07:02:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Yah
2005-12-10T07:02:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	maybe entering Load "v4l" into your /etc/X11/xorg.conf already helps
2005-12-10T07:03:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	v4l should already be compiled into Ubuntu's kernel I guess
2005-12-10T07:03:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	at least I seem to use it
2005-12-10T07:03:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	(Hauppauge analogous tv-card)
2005-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Yup, thats what Im using.
2005-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	what's your problem now? the driver is loaded
2005-12-10T07:04:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	I think it already uses it
2005-12-10T07:05:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	does lsmod list your ivtv driver?
2005-12-10T07:06:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Yes.
2005-12-10T07:07:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	so, I think now you can use your card. As the howto tells: use ptune-ui or ivtv-tune to tune the channel and cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg
2005-12-10T07:07:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Yeah thanks.
2005-12-10T07:08:00.000Z	eth42	BigKahuna	cool!
2005-12-10T07:10:00.000Z	BigKahuna	eth42	Last question, just tried to install MoTV. When I try and run the application it says a library is missing. Should all the dependencies not have been checked before installing, I used apt.
