2007-04-06T10:43:00.000Z	Derek__		as if I had shut the computer off
2007-04-06T10:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	sounds like your video driver is crashing.  check Xorg.log
2007-04-06T10:44:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	I'm using a live cd right now, the OS isn't isntalled
2007-04-06T10:44:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	i would install using Alternate and then recovery/check Xorg.1.log
2007-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	alternate cd i'd haveto suggest
2007-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	that's to be expected.  you have to modify xorg using recov mode
2007-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	*ubuntu will work the same . if your regular ubuntu does not boot properly, xubuntu wont either with your card.
2007-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	you can install from LiveCD via ubiquity, "Install" shortcut on the desktop
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	 , define "configure" a driver? a restricted driver?
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	yes
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	such as nvidia or ati?
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	it was working fine, but I disabeledd it and reset under magnetron_'s advice and now it doesn't
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	ATI
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	well grab the restricted drivers pkg then "sudo modprobe DRIVERNAME"
2007-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	e.g., "sudo modprobe nvidia" and "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" i think for nvidia
2007-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	how do I know what the driver name is?
2007-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	well tell me your device ill tell you the driver :)
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	fglrx is the driver name
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	please type my name in each msg, makes it easier for me
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	ok, sorry.  I just forgot because I am on windwows and it doesn't do the nice red outlining thing like in linux, heh
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	ohh
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	Derek__	xtknight	let me reset and try that, I'll let you know how it goes
2007-04-21T10:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	um well hold on
2007-04-21T10:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Derek__	why not just use vesa then go into restricted drivers manager?
