2008-01-25T14:32:00.000Z	Shadow147		I wanted to run my old games but I have giving up on vmware to much trouble
2008-01-25T14:34:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	dosbox is good but why is vmware too much trouble?
2008-01-25T14:36:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	I just got fed up with it slowing down my pc and I was using a pc with a P4 processor in it
2008-01-25T14:36:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	have you tried qemu or virtual box instad of vmware?
2008-01-25T14:37:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	and wine is good too
2008-01-25T14:37:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	qemu I have used before it's good never used virtualbox
2008-01-25T14:44:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	hmm btw curious why was flash player install a pain?
2008-01-25T14:45:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	well took me awhile to find the right info I needed and where to put it
2008-01-25T14:46:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	yes sometimes it happens that some tutorials have really outdated info, that confuses things a lot
2008-01-25T14:47:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	now only symlink to home or system browser profile and works fine, so easy :)
2008-01-25T14:47:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	yeah but I was able to get flash working so I am happy
2008-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	did they ever got shockwave working?
2008-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	with crossover yes
2008-01-25T14:48:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	natively no
2008-01-25T14:49:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	well I got flash running native but not shockwave
2008-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	that is because there is no native version of shockwave for linux
2008-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	unfortunly
2008-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	that is really easy also in linux make and make install :)
2008-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	of course if you do not have Makefile then it is more complicated
2008-01-25T14:53:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	well usually make install is common but sometime I don't want it installed
2008-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	yes
2008-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	just compiled and then I chmod it with +x
2008-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	phade	Shadow147	you could also run or bash it
2008-01-25T14:56:00.000Z	Shadow147	phade	true sometimes I don't want terminal to work in the background
