2007-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	in top, have a look at the second line (starting with "Cpu(s):")
2007-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	k i've got top open instead of htop
2007-10-11T14:39:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	if the machine is idle, the "id" (idle) value in that line should have a high percent value
2007-10-11T14:40:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	what about the other values in that line?
2007-10-11T14:41:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	"us" is user processes, "sy" is system work, "ni" is "nice" (some kind of background processes)
2007-10-11T14:44:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	it looks like some process is taking quite some CPU time... what is the highest process on the list in "top"?
2007-10-11T14:45:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	i started eclipse about 2 mins ago:  6447 digitals  15   0  414m  87m  15m S   93  8.7   3:45.06 eclipse
2007-10-11T14:45:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	eclipse is quite a beast...
2007-10-11T14:46:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	do you know which Java VM you use? The Sun Java VM is quite fast, but the GCJ (GNU) Java VM is really slow here
2007-10-11T15:03:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	sorry i had to go away there for a few mins
2007-10-11T15:03:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	ah is eclipse started now?
2007-10-11T15:04:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	yea it has
2007-10-11T15:05:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	that seems to be the Sun Java VM
2007-10-11T15:05:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	do you have the load problems only with eclipse, or also with other apps?
2007-10-11T15:06:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	hmm...
2007-10-11T15:06:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	so what does "top" say now?
2007-10-11T15:07:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	btw. the first line in top shows the "load average:"; that value is also a good hint about the system load (duh :-)
2007-10-11T15:08:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	hmm ok... AFAIK those are the "system loads" of last few seconds, last 5 minutes, and last 15 minutes...
2007-10-11T15:08:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	a load of 1.00 means: the system is completely "in use" but is not overloaded
2007-10-11T15:09:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	everything above 1.00 basically means the system might be a bit overloaded
2007-10-11T15:10:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	0.16 seems to be ok (you seldom have 0.00 load - on a desktop machine there are always some processes busy :)
2007-10-11T15:11:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	i'm gonna try restart, as my VPN isn't working anyway, i'll track my system load as i open stuff up
2007-10-11T15:11:00.000Z	oliver_g1	digitalspaghetti	that might be a good idea
2007-10-11T15:22:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti	oliver_g1	7.20, 4.99, 2.33  as I start up
