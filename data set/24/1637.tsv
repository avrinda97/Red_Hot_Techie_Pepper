2009-10-24T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	10 GiB for root should be more then enough for a desktop
2009-10-24T20:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	/home as large as you can is where media files end up :)
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	Program files are also stored under /home?
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	no they are in /
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	I mean, if I install k3b, in which directory would the be?
2009-10-24T20:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	under /usr/
2009-10-24T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	but believe me 10 GiB for root / is enough for a desktop
2009-10-24T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	i have 15 GiB for root i'm only using 5.1 GiB at the moment
2009-10-24T20:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	that's a waste 10GB for a root parition without /usr/ is too large
2009-10-24T20:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	you ask for help but you do not listen to the advice given...
2009-10-24T20:57:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	No I did, I just mistakenly wrote that I was going to create a separate partition for /usr
2009-10-25T02:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	what version of ubuntu ?
2009-10-25T04:24:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	ctmjr, I'm getting 'xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwritting possibly-customised configuration' 'file; backup in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.2009102418...'
2009-10-25T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	that's normal. it makes a backup before creating the new conf
2009-10-25T04:25:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	yes, but the thing is I'm not getting anything else :)
2009-10-25T04:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	normal again. he created an alternative configuration file. to test it you have to bring up xserver
2009-10-25T04:27:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	Isn't there a command that Gives you a text based automated configuration for X?, where you put the refresh rates, and then asks about the video card, the monitor, the keyboard layout
2009-10-25T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2009-10-25T04:31:00.000Z	gcrazy	erUSUL	that starts the configuration script that I'm talking about, however it just goes until keyboard configuration :(
2009-10-25T05:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove
2009-10-25T05:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-10-25T05:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	look for a line that is # defoptions=quiet splash change it to # defoptions=
2009-10-25T05:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	do sudo update-grub
2009-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	gcrazy	nano
