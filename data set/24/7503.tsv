2004-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	geppy		I'd like to install extendedprefs for GAIM, but I'm unable to, as it uses libtool, and I don't have anything else installed with it, so all of the environment variables and such are undeclared.  What should I do?
2004-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	Why not install libtool?
2004-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	I did, but I'm getting things like "extendedprefs.c:553: error: `GAIM_MINOR_VERSION' undeclared here (not in a function)"
2004-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 (tons and tons of things like that)
2004-11-13T12:09:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	Add the word multiverse to the end of the line that has universe on it.
2004-11-13T12:09:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	The deb lines that is.
2005-02-15T16:46:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	Why didn't you make it the debian way? A lot easier.
2005-02-15T16:47:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	No
2005-02-15T16:52:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	Hope you still have your old kernel set up./
2005-02-15T16:59:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	How did it go?
2005-02-16T17:01:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Any advice? =)
2005-03-08T08:46:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Yes, this is true.
2005-03-08T08:47:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Let me be the millionth to point out:  End-users can use JACK happily;  Any kind of serious audio workstation can't be without it.
2005-03-08T08:48:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	I know. The thing is that it forces all apps to work at particular sample rates, which then means that if they need to resample, there is more work to do. Then there is also the problem of badly coded jack clients.
2005-03-08T08:48:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	I am on the jackit-devel list and this sort of thing has been raised before.
2005-03-08T08:49:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	The jack developers are mainly interested in it for pro audio work.
2005-03-08T08:49:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Yes.
2005-03-08T08:59:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	There are many other multimedia based distros out there already. Agnulla, etc.
2005-03-08T08:59:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 And they're good for nothing else.
2005-03-08T09:00:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	So you mean a distro that can be used for multimedia as well as general use?
2005-03-08T09:00:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Yes.
2005-03-08T09:00:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	Fair enough.
2005-03-08T09:01:00.000Z	TheMuso	geppy	I personally wouldn't use something like that, as I like to have something optimally configured for a single use. In this case, audio work, and for this I have Slackware with my own packages.
2005-03-08T09:01:00.000Z	geppy	TheMuso	 Understood, but I am not of that type. =)
