2012-04-01T04:50:00.000Z	icehawk		ummm..hope you have a boot disc Ubravo
2012-04-01T04:51:00.000Z	icehawk		check your firewall. could be you have not installed ubuntu cloud or registerd. could be you do not have softwarre that matches the servers you are connecting could be to many thing
2012-04-01T04:52:00.000Z	icehawk		s
2012-04-01T04:53:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Check the Ubuntu firewall? Isn't it off by default? Also, I am not quite sure how to check ubuntu firewall... and I did not install cloud owo
2012-04-01T04:57:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	hm, well I used ufw to 'open' 9987 becuse ufw did tell me firewall is enabled...
2012-04-01T04:57:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	I am not trying to share files wirelessly, I am trying to enable people to connect to a server that should be listening on port 9987
2012-04-01T04:57:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	however, even though I 'opened' 9987 in ufw netstat doesn't show it =.=
2012-04-01T05:01:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	okay, thanks. I am running with putty ssh connection and I am not using any GUI on the server so... I, more than likely, will have no clue how to operate these services =\
2012-04-01T05:02:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	But I will def. try, thanks :)
2012-04-01T05:03:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	oh, this is a nightmare alright. Thanks xD
2012-04-01T05:06:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Ah, I see lol. I suppose I will have to do the same
2012-04-01T05:36:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Not quite sure how to use firestarter, but I will download it. I have had 9987 open for 1.5 years until two days ago owo
2012-04-01T05:37:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	I know how to get it, I am downloading it now... but I am not using a GUI owo
2012-04-01T05:40:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	I have firestarter installed but... how do I access it now?
2012-04-01T05:42:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	I have it downloaded... but it didn't prompt me to do anything after installation... I don't know how to use this program lol.
2012-04-01T05:42:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	At least, not without GUI
2012-04-01T05:45:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	I can't... I don't have GUI  o.o
2012-04-01T05:47:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	The video you listed, the person uses a GUI. Again, I am using pure terminal no GUI
2012-04-01T07:10:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Sorry, I used it once a long time ago but... not since.
2012-04-01T07:10:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	You are using a GUI? I had no issues with it when I used it owo but, this was a long time ago and not on server.
2012-04-01T07:11:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Well, I only use Ubuntu for server, and windows for all else. I can actually DO stuff in windows owo lol. I don't feel like such a newb xD . Though... put me in my registry and I will screw everything up owo
2012-04-01T07:12:00.000Z	smg60231_	icehawk	Ah, once I get to college, they will have some ACTUAL computer programs xD . Not like basic HTML crap =.= . Anyway, thank you so much for the help. Logging off ^^
