2008-06-02T16:31:00.000Z	s3a		how do i make multiple jpegs get a lower resolution at a time insted of 1 by 1 with gimp (is there a way to do this with imagemagick for example?)
2008-06-02T16:32:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	that's the kind of thing imagemagick was made for =).. I don't know the exact syntax but it can def do it
2008-06-02T16:33:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	 well to convert a pdf to jpegs it would be: "convert -units PixelsPerInch -density 150x150 filename.pdf filename.jpg" so would u no how to modify this command?
2008-06-02T16:33:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	I'll take a look at it.. I'm bored out of my skull here anyway =)
2008-06-02T16:34:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	i need to go to skool and i need to convert my jpeg notes to that res so i can view on my psp and i gota leave in like 5 min
2008-06-02T16:34:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php
2008-06-02T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	find ./ -type f -exec convert -resample 100x100 {} \; might do the trick... but better keep a backup just in case it does something nasty
2008-06-02T16:40:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	wat part of ur message is the command?
2008-06-02T16:40:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	from find up to and including the \;
2008-06-02T16:42:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	nope.. didn't work..  it needs an output filename
2008-06-02T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	find ./ -type f -exec convert -resize x480 {} {}-new.jpg \;     This will resize all images to 480 width and save the new images as the old filename + -new.jpg
2008-06-27T02:13:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	I think wine is 32-bit.. no matter how you compile it.. (not that it matters for your question.. )
2008-08-20T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	I don't think you can
2008-08-20T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	not without wiping the partition
2008-08-20T01:57:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	captain: should i put that in brainstorm?
2008-08-20T01:57:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	captain? .. well.. no, it's not a bug.. it's just the way ntfs and ext3 are
2008-08-20T01:58:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	captainm is another person here
2008-08-20T01:58:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	you can't convert ntfs to ext3 in place, you can't eat candy all day, you cant fly by flapping your arms.. some things aren't meant to be =)
2008-08-20T01:58:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	and not as a bug report, as an idea, like couldnt it be a nice feature request or is it absolutely impossible?
2008-08-20T01:59:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	I would say it's impossible.. it might be doable but it isn't worth the time and effort
2008-08-20T02:00:00.000Z	s3a	Slart	well if u ask me, its worth it cuz such a feature is good to convert windows users ;) but thats not my situation
2008-08-20T02:02:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	well.. let's say this will take 400 man years... that time would be better spent on other things.. making directx games run natively in ubuntu, drivers for all graphics cards, booting in <10 secs.. all that.. or convert ntfs to ext3 in place..
2010-06-01T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	awn or cairo-dock
2010-06-01T04:03:00.000Z	Slart	s3a	they are both easy to configure (comes with a small gui-configure-dialog thing)
