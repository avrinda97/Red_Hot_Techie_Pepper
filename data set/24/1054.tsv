2010-08-14T17:21:00.000Z	sarah32		<linxeh> so i have some problem with something right ?
2010-08-14T17:22:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	without seeing more lines of that log (use http://ubuntu.pastebin.com to paste it, not in the channel!) it is hard to tell
2010-08-14T17:22:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	what device is it ?
2010-08-14T17:23:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	paste the full output of dmesg into the pastebin
2010-08-14T17:24:00.000Z	sarah32	linxeh	http://paste.ubuntu.com/477901/
2010-08-14T17:31:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	yeah, I dont think it is a problem, assuming everything is working for you. can you paste the output of    lspci -v
2010-08-14T17:38:00.000Z	sarah32	linxeh	 did you see ?
2010-08-14T17:40:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	will look, sec
2010-08-14T17:41:00.000Z	sarah32	linxeh	tnx
2010-08-14T17:41:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	ok, does everything appear to work for you ?
2010-08-14T17:42:00.000Z	sarah32	linxeh	 no cdrom doesnt work with udev
2010-08-14T17:42:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	to me it just likes the PCIE ports on your motherboard dont support that request the kernel made when it installed the firmware, I dont think it will affect you
2010-08-14T17:43:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	ok, I you can change the udev rules in /etc/udev/rules.d
2010-08-14T17:44:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	have you changed your CD drive or something ?
2010-08-14T17:45:00.000Z	sarah32	linxeh	 no i didnt change anything
2010-08-14T17:46:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	ok, I'm afraid I don't know much about udev - I've not had to do much with it myself
2010-08-14T17:46:00.000Z	linxeh	sarah32	I see there is this though - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/562092
