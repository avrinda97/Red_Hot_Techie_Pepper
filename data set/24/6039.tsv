2006-02-21T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	sudo apt-get install <packagename>
2006-02-21T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-02-21T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	sure.  That's a common question :)
2006-02-21T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	you don't have -dev libraries installed that you need
2006-02-21T12:04:00.000Z	|alpha	tritium	how can i do?
2006-02-21T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	you need libglib, from your error
2006-02-21T12:05:00.000Z	|alpha	tritium	yes i have the source code
2006-02-21T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	install the libglib2.0-dev package
2006-02-21T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	gcc will work if you installed build-essential
2006-02-21T12:07:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	apt-cache search <search_term> can be very useful.  You can also try synaptic
2006-02-21T12:08:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	it's in the repos
2006-02-21T12:09:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	don't forget the "-dev" at the end
2006-02-21T12:11:00.000Z	|alpha	tritium	thx for ur effort will talk german in #ubuntu-de :)
2006-02-21T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	|alpha	okay :)
