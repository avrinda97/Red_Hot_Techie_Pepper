2009-11-01T23:14:00.000Z	iWolf		•jMyles• No Sound?
2009-11-01T23:15:00.000Z	iWolf		No Sound, Am I Correct?
2009-11-01T23:15:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	That's correct.  No sound.  I have a Sound Blaster Live, but Pulseaudio does not seem to recognize it since upgrading to Karmic.
2009-11-01T23:16:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Then run sudo update-grub
2009-11-01T23:17:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	done.
2009-11-01T23:17:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	thank you, be right back.
2009-11-01T23:19:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	I am back no sound.
2009-11-01T23:20:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	There was a kernel mismatch i believe
2009-11-01T23:20:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	How can I confirm a kernel mismatch?  Will this also explain the old splash screen?
2009-11-01T23:21:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Do you have grub?
2009-11-01T23:21:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	How can I tell?  It looks like the same old grub.
2009-11-01T23:22:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Did you put sudo in front of it?
2009-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	sudo in front of what?
2009-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	sudo update-grub
2009-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	yes I did.
2009-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	Is there anything i can discern from the output of update-grub that will be useful?
2009-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Yes
2009-11-01T23:24:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	If it is updated, it might be a hardware problem
2009-11-01T23:24:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	How can I tell if it is updated?  What can I look for in the output of update-grub?
2009-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Go to a terminal
2009-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	iWolf	jMyles	Run sudo update-grub again
2009-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	done.
2009-11-01T23:28:00.000Z	jMyles	iWolf	I'm going to go into my grub menu and see what the options are.  If you think of anything, I'll be back.
