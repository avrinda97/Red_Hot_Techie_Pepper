2008-12-28T01:32:00.000Z	faisal_d		I'm on Ubuntu 8.04, and I just used system monitor to check my free HDD space... there is a 5 GB difference between the free and available.. any ideas why?
2008-12-28T01:33:00.000Z	faisal_d		﻿Dr_Willis_AAO: oh.. didn't know that
2008-12-28T01:34:00.000Z	duffydack	faisal_d	sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/hda1 or whatever
2008-12-28T01:34:00.000Z	faisal_d		﻿duffydack: thanx mate
2008-12-28T01:34:00.000Z	duffydack	faisal_d	ive always failed to see the point of the 5% reservation of ext3..
2008-12-28T01:35:00.000Z	duffydack		guess ive never had an "emergency"
2008-12-28T01:35:00.000Z	faisal_d	duffydack	is it like for restore points? what goes into those 5%?
2008-12-28T01:36:00.000Z	duffydack		i make sure it wont get full..
2008-12-28T01:36:00.000Z	duffydack		its supposed to be for root access, running progs for recovery etc, and as willis says, lost n found..i guess
2008-12-28T01:37:00.000Z	duffydack		for me, in the real world its not needed...
2008-12-28T01:37:00.000Z	duffydack		set it to 1% or something then.. i
2008-12-28T01:37:00.000Z	duffydack		depends how big your / is set to.
2008-12-28T01:38:00.000Z	faisal_d	duffydack	I have a 10G partition for /, and another 100G partition for /home... and those 5 missing from /home are annoying me
2008-12-28T01:38:00.000Z	duffydack	faisal_d	what mount point is it anyway ?
2008-12-28T01:39:00.000Z	duffydack		ah.. well,   set to 0
2008-12-28T01:39:00.000Z	faisal_d	duffydack	yeah I was thinking that... don't need much there
2008-12-28T01:39:00.000Z	duffydack		the chances it being full and errored to hell, well.. if it were me i`d set to 0
2008-12-28T01:40:00.000Z	duffydack		dont come here lookin for me when it all goes ****
2008-12-28T01:41:00.000Z	faisal_d		﻿Dr_Willis_AAO: kk.. thanx
2008-12-28T01:41:00.000Z	duffydack		sudo tune2fs -l /dev/whatever will show its reserved space
2008-12-28T01:41:00.000Z	duffydack		among other things
2008-12-28T01:41:00.000Z	faisal_d		this will help me for now... I guess I should invest in some more storage, probably an external HDD or something
2008-12-28T01:42:00.000Z	duffydack		curiousity, a 100g home, what do you have there?  ihad a 160gig external and its JFS...ext3 is too slow at working with 10-20gig files (virtualbox)..and lots of small files too..
2008-12-28T01:43:00.000Z	faisal_d	duffydack	lots of anime :)
