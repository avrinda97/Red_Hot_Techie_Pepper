2009-12-12T05:36:00.000Z	lolmac404		Hi, i recentely installed ubuntu 9.1, i'm having a huge problem with pppoe, in ubuntu previous versions it worked perfectly, in this new version of ubuntu, i have to choose between wired connection, OR dsl connection, but i use a dsl connection THROUGH a wired connection, so in other OS and older versions of ubuntu, i used a wired connection + a dsl connection that was dialed (pppoe)
