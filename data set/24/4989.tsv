2006-12-16T08:31:00.000Z	Tonren		Guys, I have a horrible urgent problem and need help
2006-12-16T08:32:00.000Z	Tonren		I left my computer on until the battery ran out and it tried to hibernate, and now I can't boot into Linux
2006-12-16T08:32:00.000Z	Tonren		I'm on Windows ont he same laptop right now (I dual-boot)
2006-12-16T08:32:00.000Z	Tonren		When I try to mount the Linux partition in Windows with Ext2FS, I get a "This drive is not formatted error"
2006-12-16T08:32:00.000Z	Tonren		It was giving me Error 0x40 when I ran without quiet splash
2006-12-16T08:33:00.000Z	Tonren		Someone PLEASE help, this is completely awful and I badly need to fix it right away.
2006-12-16T08:33:00.000Z	Tonren		C'mon guys... this is SO urgent
2006-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	Tonren		It was hanging on /scripts/premount
2006-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren		C'mon guys.  Someone PLEASE help with this.  I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
2006-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren		Someone PLEASE help out.  This seriously sucks, this is a code red holy shit emergency.
