2005-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	qt2		well wtf.
2005-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	qt2		is there something up with apt/synaptic...?
2005-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	qt2		Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/libc/libcairo/libcairo1_0.3.0-1_i386.deb  MD5Sum mismatch
2005-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	qt2		E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
2005-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	qt2		been getting lots of those lately... <.<;
2005-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	remove the "us" from those urls
2005-07-15T16:00:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	what?
2005-07-15T16:00:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	eh?
2005-07-15T16:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	that's the command you'd use to "kill yourself" on irc
2005-07-15T16:01:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	i wasnt trying to do that... ;)
2005-07-15T16:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	type your nick's password after it
2005-07-15T16:11:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	you shouldn't have to copy things into your home dir as root, and you shouldn't have to be root to play mp3s.  You can get mp3 support by grabbing gstreamer0.8-mad from Universe
2005-07-15T05:27:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	you shouldn't have to do that, seriously.  Get beep-media-player and try it as a normal user.  If you need mp3 stuffs, get gtreamer0.8-mad
2005-07-15T05:28:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	err, i've tried it with several medial players, unless i open them via a root terminal, they wont open.
2005-07-15T05:29:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	=\  what do they say to you?
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	not a word, they just.. dont play.
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	are they in your home directory?
2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	aye.
2005-07-15T05:33:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	it's probably a sound thing.  If you want, you can follow this long convoluted sound setup thread, but I'm not guaranteeing it will work for you
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	heh, it's a chown problem o.o;
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	glad you've solved it then
2005-07-15T05:36:00.000Z	qt2	tiglionabbit	;)
2005-07-18T16:59:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	qt2	I don't know
