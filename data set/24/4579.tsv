2007-03-04T13:33:00.000Z	LordLimecat		mine works perfectly
2007-03-04T13:34:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	In my experience when playing games fullscreen with beryl, the panels wouldn't hide, they would stay on the top and the bottom of the screen.
2007-03-04T13:34:00.000Z	LordLimecat	billymeter	this was the case for WoW, you are righ
2007-03-04T13:35:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	Ah, I see
2007-03-04T13:35:00.000Z	LordLimecat	billymeter	but it works, and allows easy rotating between game and other stuff, like thottbot or (HOPEFULLY) a second WoW instance :D
2007-03-04T13:36:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	=D I use to play WoW, taking a hiatus right now.

2007-03-04T13:52:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	I know, I was thinking ahead and held down shift when typing lynx =)
2007-03-04T13:52:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	I got too excited.
2007-03-04T13:53:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	lol
2007-03-04T13:55:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	I'll agree with that
2007-03-04T13:57:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	Not really. I'm still pretty much a n00b.
2007-03-04T13:58:00.000Z	billymeter	LordLimecat	Probably the most advanced Linux thing I've done has been getting the Broadcom driver to work in Slackware.
