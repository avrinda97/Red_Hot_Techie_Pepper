2009-08-14T08:14:00.000Z	zetheroo1		sorry to say but Ubuntu is proving to be a further let-down with each new release ... :(
2009-08-14T08:15:00.000Z	zetheroo1		Kernel Panics since Intrepid ... and no help in sight ...
2009-08-14T08:15:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	maybe you are expecting it to be too much like windows?
2009-08-14T08:21:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	they also fixed a lot of things im sure, just different bugs heh
2009-08-14T08:22:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	oh certainly ... but what is the point of fixing something and breaking other things?
2009-08-14T08:22:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	such is software development
2009-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	and I am talking about wireless and graphic cards ... stuff that was working before ... and now is useless ...
2009-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	that is not all ubuntu, if you are using proprietary graphics drivers for instance
2009-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	that's not true ... and if it is then someone needs to find a new hobby
2009-08-14T08:23:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	not using proprietary drivers
2009-08-14T08:24:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	maybe that would fix your problem then.
2009-08-14T08:25:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	have you checked System->Administration->Hardware Drivers?
2009-08-14T08:26:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	uh ... why would I do that?
2009-08-14T08:26:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	im using an atheros card on a macbook pro that is working fine
2009-08-14T08:27:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	which wasnt true 3 releases ago incidently
2009-08-14T08:27:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	what chipset and what driver?
2009-08-14T08:27:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	way way better than what you used to have to do with madwifi or ndiswrapper
2009-08-14T08:28:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	see that's the kicker ... there are many who have the same hardware who are not having issues and then others who are ... so maybe its a combination of hardware that makes the issue ...
2009-08-14T08:28:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	are you sure its the wireless card?
2009-08-14T08:29:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	I only recall having to do that with BC chipsets
2009-08-14T08:29:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	no .. but when wireless is disabled the system stays on for more than 5 min
2009-08-14T08:30:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR5008 Wireless Network Adapter (rev 01), with default drivers
2009-08-14T08:31:00.000Z	zetheroo1	jedc	Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR5212 802.11abg NIC (rev 01)
2009-08-14T08:34:00.000Z	jedc	zetheroo1	it looks like this is the same issue, no solution there though http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1206430
