2012-11-29T00:15:00.000Z	Guest6188		Hey guys, I'm trying to install libreoffice from the repositories, but it's throwing a wobbly. Can anyone help? Looks like dependency problems, but when I attempt to resolve them it throws a wobbly at me. http://pastebin.com/7nzTMStH
2012-11-29T00:15:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	try 'apt-get install -f'
2012-11-29T00:16:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	yeah, it looks like you don't have java install
2012-11-29T00:17:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	You need to try to run 'apt-get install -f', just that string
2012-11-29T00:18:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	try 'apt-get purge libreoffice'
2012-11-29T00:18:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	it looks like you had it installed previously
2012-11-29T00:21:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	update: just realized I removed it earlier because it wasn't working. let me re-install.
2012-11-29T00:24:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	when I run 'apt-get purge libreoffice' it just complains of unmet dependencies/
2012-11-29T00:24:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	but you were able to reinstall fine?
2012-11-29T00:25:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	no, it throws the errors seen in the pastebin at me
2012-11-29T00:25:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	jwrigley, check to see if /var/lib/libreoffice/share/prereg exists
2012-11-29T00:26:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	doesn't appear to exist when i cd to it in terminal
2012-11-29T00:30:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	use apt-get via the command line
2012-11-29T00:31:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	tab completion helps a lot
2012-11-29T00:32:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	run 'apt-get purge libreoffice'
2012-11-29T00:32:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	oh, yeah i see now. sorry.
2012-11-29T00:33:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	now it is telling me to fix dependencies with apt-get install -f
2012-11-29T00:40:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	awesome, so are you all set now?
2012-11-29T00:41:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	well libreoffice is still not working, so no.
2012-11-29T00:41:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	what happened after you apt-get install -f'd
2012-11-29T00:43:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	nothing, when i click libreoffice writer (which has no icon either) it just doesn't start.
2012-11-29T00:43:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	try launching it from the terminal
2012-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	Guest6188	twirm	yeah I just did to investigate, it says the program is missing.
2012-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	twirm	Guest6188	Can you reboot real fast and then we can move from there?
