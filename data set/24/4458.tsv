2007-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	foug_		has anyone downloaded the new version of opera? 9.5? I'm confused as to which version to get, you can see them all here; http://snapshot.opera.com/unix/9.50-Alpha-1/
2007-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	do you know your machine type?
2007-09-07T13:39:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	probably ppc-linux, intel-linux, or x86_64-linux
2007-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	well i have an amd processor, if there's a command i can put into terminal i can find out
2007-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	uname -a
2007-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	hmmm, didn't really give me a good answer. i686? lol
2007-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	32-bit
2007-09-07T13:40:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	i686=32-bit, x86_64=64-bit
2007-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	i686 happens to be called intel there so use intel-linux
2007-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	cat /proc/cpuinfo says amd 64 processor
2007-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	you're running 32-bit ubuntu
2007-09-07T13:41:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	you need not your CPU's arch but your OS's architecture from uname -a
2007-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	ahhh i see
2007-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	so intel-linux is the one to download then?
2007-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	amd64 CPUs (as you can see) can run both 32 and 64bit OS
2007-09-07T13:42:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	ya
2007-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	http://snapshot.opera.com/unix/9.50-Alpha-1/intel-linux/ is the new page after clicking intel-linux, what does 5-6-shared mean?
2007-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	then there appears to be many options there.  i would choose the latest version (.10) and static.  static reduces problems running the program on a system with a lot of libraries.
2007-09-07T13:43:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	with shared you're taking a chance that your system has what opera needs.  static ensures that library X is included in Opera itself so there are no problems
2007-09-07T13:44:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	hmm, so opera-9.50-20070903.10-static-qt.i386-1567.tar.gz ?
2007-09-07T13:44:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	right
2007-09-07T13:44:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	ya
2007-09-07T13:45:00.000Z	xtknight	foug_	 actually 98% of people will probably download what you are (for ubuntu)
2007-09-07T13:45:00.000Z	foug_	xtknight	ahhh i see
