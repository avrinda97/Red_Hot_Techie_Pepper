2012-11-29T02:18:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	what is: apt-cache policy libsdl1.2-dev libpulse-dev;
2012-11-29T02:21:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	this is it.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1395473/
2012-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	looks fine, how about the output of: sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev;
2012-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	it seems right but .. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1395484/
2012-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	do you have -proposed enabled?
2012-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	i suppose that my repository is not valid
2012-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	fishcooker		should i change/ remove id on *archive.ubuntu.co.id
2012-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	fishcooker		sorry *com
2012-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	I don't know that there is necessarily anything wrong with that mirror just yet, but the version it wants to install seems to still be in lucid-proposed, can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2012-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	or alternatively look in software-properties-gtk on the Updates tab and see if -proposed is checked
2012-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	fishcooker		i've just checked the box for lucid-proposed
2012-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	i hope it solved the problem .. thanks
2012-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	so it wasn't checked? you probably don't want it checked, I just wanted to know whether it was enabled or not
2012-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	fishcooker		yes it was'nt checked
2012-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	yeah then it may be an issue with the mirror being out of sync, have you run: sudo apt-get update; yet?
2012-11-29T02:36:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	on progress ...
2012-11-29T02:40:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	oh out of curiosity, what is: apt-cache policy libpulse0;
2012-11-29T02:40:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	maybe you had -proposed before, but removed it, but you have newer versions of libpulse0
2012-11-29T02:41:00.000Z	fishcooker		it works trism
2012-11-29T02:41:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	all fixed?
2012-11-29T02:42:00.000Z	fishcooker		its downloading
2012-11-29T02:42:00.000Z	fishcooker		btw on what err message .. you know that my lucid-proposed doesnt include on my sourcelist?
2012-11-29T02:42:00.000Z	fishcooker	trism	thankyou
2012-11-29T02:43:00.000Z	trism	fishcooker	I could tell because of the version it wanted to install, 14.1 instead of 14
