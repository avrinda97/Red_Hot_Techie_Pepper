2012-05-14T14:12:00.000Z	Qasaur		Is the ports blocked or something?
2012-05-14T14:13:00.000Z	Qasaur		huh?
2012-05-14T14:13:00.000Z	Qasaur		This is a small school, not university
2012-05-14T14:14:00.000Z	Qasaur		alright
2012-05-14T14:14:00.000Z	Qasaur		Unable to connect

2012-05-14T14:15:00.000Z	Qasaur		yep that works
2012-05-14T14:15:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	and then type "GET /" and hit enter a few times and check whether the response is google.
2012-05-14T14:16:00.000Z	Qasaur	muelli	What do you mean?
2012-05-14T14:17:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	in the connected telnet session, issue a GET request yourself, to check whether your network presents you a proxy page or indeed the real google.
2012-05-14T14:17:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	type "GET /" in the telnet session.
2012-05-14T14:25:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	just remove the "> /dev/null" and scan your terminal for google's page. Or whether there is smth related to your school
2012-05-14T14:31:00.000Z	Qasaur	muelli	I couldn't download anything from the repositories
2012-05-14T14:31:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	how do you know?
2012-05-14T14:31:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	may I guess what you've tried and what the error was? Or will you tell us?
2012-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	type pwd to find out
2012-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	Qasaur	muelli	Huh?
2012-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	to find where the downloaded index.html is
2012-05-14T14:39:00.000Z	Qasaur	muelli	It works
2012-05-14T14:40:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	k. then what did you try to install?
2012-05-14T14:40:00.000Z	muelli	Qasaur	Then do "apt-get install anything" and paste us the output
