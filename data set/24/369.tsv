2011-11-10T15:27:00.000Z	StompinBroknGlas	Younder	I have added the my self to the audio, pulse, pulse-settings groups, do I have to do something else ?
2011-11-10T15:30:00.000Z	StompinBroknGlas	Younder	do I have to re-loging or something ? the input Connector drop down box is still reverting to line-in
2011-11-10T15:30:00.000Z	Younder	StompinBroknGlas	No it should just work
2011-11-10T15:31:00.000Z	Younder	StompinBroknGlas	but in doubt reboot

2011-11-10T15:46:00.000Z	Younder	StompinBroknGlas	Well it worked for me
2011-11-10T15:47:00.000Z	Younder	StompinBroknGlas	Why do you want to change the input connector?
2011-11-10T15:48:00.000Z	StompinBroknGlas	Younder	 Was testing the line-in, now I want to use my headset mic

2011-11-10T16:19:00.000Z	StompinBroknGlas	Younder	I'm using on-board sound, it's a VIA chipset
2011-11-10T16:21:00.000Z	Younder	StompinBroknGlas	Well, I am sorry. I am clueless. It  should just work
2011-11-10T16:23:00.000Z	StompinBroknGlas	Younder	it's ok, could it be a bug or something ?
