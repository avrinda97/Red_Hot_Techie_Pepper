2007-12-06T22:37:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		hey if  i have 653 megs of ram, is there any way to tell why swap space is being used?
2007-12-06T22:38:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		megs of free ram
2007-12-06T22:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 the 'free' command
2007-12-06T22:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 I would say somthing paged out to swap and just hasent paged back yet.
2007-12-06T22:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 from what ive read over the years.. its best to let linux handle the memory and not try to tweak it like people try to di with windoes.
2009-03-08T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 enables the backports repository
2009-03-08T18:01:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	is it a backport from jaunty to intrepid?
2009-03-08T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 no idea.. could be in some cases I guess. but not always
2009-03-08T18:02:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	i think that is what has messed up X for me
2009-03-08T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 'updated unofficial, but desireable packages' is how i think of it.
2009-03-08T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 in KDE or gnome its laggy?
2009-03-08T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 yiou can always reinstall grep i imagine
2009-03-08T18:07:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	yes, but synaptic was throwing all sorts of warnings
2009-03-08T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 yep. that can happen when you start adding.remioveing repos and stuff. and why backports is considerd optional/unsupported.
2009-03-08T18:08:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	yeah but i would think that removing the repo, then deleting orphaned packages should be smooth
2009-03-08T18:09:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	when it was installing kde I saw it pulling in Xorg packages -- which is what i think my problem is
2009-03-08T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 could be its using some older/veasa/whatever drivers instad of the ones you need for your system.
2009-03-08T18:11:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	so how do i verify the versions and all that to get this thing working again?
2009-03-08T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	  not sure. You could try reinstalling your video card drivers i guess. Ive rarely had issues remioving things.. i rarely remove things.
2009-03-08T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 X -version perhaps
2009-03-08T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 somthing from 'ppa' would be very unofficial i think
2009-03-08T18:14:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	so should i just reinstall xorg-server again?
2009-03-08T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hvgotcodes	 could try i guess.   thats all we are doing here is guessing basically.
2009-03-08T18:16:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Dr_willis	yeah what  i really wanted to do was somehow tell synaptic to go back to the latest supported packages across the board
