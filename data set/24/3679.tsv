2008-05-02T06:41:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	you sure the file hasn't been overwritten?
2008-05-02T06:41:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	positive
2008-05-02T06:42:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	don't know why it would be ignored - you can   sudo /etc/init.d networking restart   to see if the file is used
2008-05-02T06:44:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	its not ignored per say what appears to happen is when i restart networking the static is applied as expected but when the dhcp lease expires it renews it ignoring the static
2008-05-02T06:44:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	can you paste /etc/network/interfaces?
2008-05-02T06:45:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	http://paste.ubuntu.com/9356/
2008-05-02T06:46:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	that looks right
2008-05-02T06:47:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	why, with a static ip address, do you have a dhcp lease?
2008-05-02T06:47:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	i had this problem in fedora befor i switched and had to disable network-manager to get it to stop using dhcp, as far as i can tel network-manager is not installed on 8.04 correct?
2008-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	no clue..... i dont want one
2008-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	it is installed - in control center I think
2008-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	any hints on how to manage it via cli..... not running a gui on this box
2008-05-02T06:49:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	I use the interfaces file for that...
2008-05-02T06:50:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	locate doesnt yield anything named network-manager
2008-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	that's a gui thing - and you have no gui - is it something with your router resetting or similar?
2008-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	why would the router be forcing dhcp requests?
2008-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	now that you mention it though  this did start happening shortly after replacing my old router
2008-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	never had your issue - looking for clues
2008-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	there you go
2008-05-02T06:53:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	........ im totaly confused by that though... i mean time line matches up .... but that confuses me to the point of taking a shotgun to my computer
2008-05-02T06:54:00.000Z	ere4si	Sylphid	shoot the router not the comp
2008-05-02T06:54:00.000Z	Sylphid	ere4si	i need a new one of both =P
