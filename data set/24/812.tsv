2011-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs		but the laptop I'm on seems to be getting an IP from DHCP just fine
2011-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	try plugging the computer directly to the router instead of the switch and than plugging it back into the switch after it has obtained an IP?
2011-01-11T08:55:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	Not really an option. The machines are in different rooms.
2011-01-11T08:55:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	move it
2011-01-11T08:55:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	and than move it back
2011-01-11T08:56:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	trust me it will turn back on
2011-01-11T08:57:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	from the ubuntu fresh installed?
2011-01-11T08:57:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	Yeah. It wouldn't even get an IP during the installation process
2011-01-11T08:57:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	does the windows machine give you an issue with two machines getting the same IP?
2011-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	Not sure what you're asking.
2011-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	unplug your switch take out the input and stick it in the machine. obtain an IP. Plug the switch back in. Than plug the internet back into the switch
2011-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	Worth a shot I suppose. Gonna lose connection while I do that, of course.
2011-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	its ok you know where to finds us :)
2011-01-11T09:09:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	so did you fix it?
2011-01-11T09:10:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	SOmewhat: I tried a DIFFERENT switch. And it's working.
2011-01-11T09:11:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	I only have one switch so if its not working I'm in trouble :)
2011-01-11T09:14:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	well in that case I was just trying to make you feel better I have 3 routers and 1 switch :p
2011-01-11T09:15:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	all wireless (not switch)
2011-01-11T09:17:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	There's only so high I can have the router
2011-01-11T09:17:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	buy a longer cord :p
2011-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	nivida is also a network adapter in some machines
2011-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	Fortunately not in this system. But no, it was specifically telling me to install the drivers for the Geforce
2011-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	meway	DW_Upstairs	my HP had both so I was like erf?
2011-01-11T09:39:00.000Z	DW_Upstairs	meway	He specifically asked for console
