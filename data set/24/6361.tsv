2007-12-05T01:33:00.000Z	jenda		Which text editor will allow me to open a ISO-8859-2 html file without messing up teh encoding and how?
2007-12-05T01:34:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Any, you might have to manually set the encoding
2007-12-05T01:35:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	ok, and how would I do that with gedit?
2007-12-05T01:36:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Use vim and set encoding of console
2007-12-05T01:36:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	yikes - that won't work :)
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	I need to actually do some work once the file is open ;)
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	I don't have gedit installed
2007-12-05T01:37:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	ok, I'll RTFM, then ;)
2007-12-05T01:38:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Just browse menus
2007-12-05T01:45:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	I have to admit, gedit sucks :P
2007-12-05T01:45:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Use something else, like... vim :P
2007-12-05T01:45:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	:)
2007-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	i'm trying scribes... and I found out how to open it with gedit now.
2007-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	that is, gedit --encoding ISO-8859-2 file.html
2007-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Good good
2007-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	I still recommend you to learn vim
2007-12-05T01:46:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	It's easyer than you think :P
2007-12-05T01:47:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	oh, I tried it. The effort to learn it, however, is not worth it for me, as i'd use it once a year.
2007-12-05T01:47:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	I'm a law student, not a computer guy.
2007-12-05T01:47:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Okay
2007-12-05T01:48:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	That makes no sense, lawstudents don't use lunix
2007-12-05T01:49:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	oh yes they do... they can even be Ubuntu members ;)
2007-12-05T01:49:00.000Z	Suva	jenda	Ah, for fighting those evil patent guys
2007-12-05T01:50:00.000Z	jenda	Suva	among other things :)
