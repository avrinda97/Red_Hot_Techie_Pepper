2007-02-18T08:00:00.000Z	bdina		has anyone had any luck with vlc in firefox??
2007-02-18T08:01:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i think i did
2007-02-18T08:02:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	cause i cannot seem to get my 0.8.6 plugin working on 6.10
2007-02-18T08:03:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	my version reads 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-1ubuntu1.1  .. i use backports and universe
2007-02-18T08:03:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	i think that was the same ver i was using... i get a "no video" output in the browser
2007-02-18T08:04:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i think it depends on the installed codecs then, download the video and try to run off the hdd
2007-02-18T08:05:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	that part works fine -- when i enter the url (into stand-alone player) it works as well, its only the plugin that wont play correctly i guess
2007-02-18T08:06:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i cant help then - i also cant play some vids off web and thought it was the codec
2007-02-18T08:06:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	oh well -- thanks anyway
2007-02-18T08:08:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	vlc/firefox looks like no-go http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?p=98805
2007-02-18T08:09:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	ive seen that link, i am guessing it really is a problem -- there's even a bug open with ubuntu that has yet to be worked on ... but there are also tutorials on how to get the plugin installed so that seems to contradict bugs -- i assume that someone would only create a howto if it actually did work -- right??
2007-02-18T08:11:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	if it worked, then it should be enougth to install that package... anyway there are other player plugins .. gxineplugin, totem-mozilla
2007-02-18T08:12:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	mozilla-mplayer
2007-02-18T08:12:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i didn't need video that badly to try them all though:)
2007-02-18T08:13:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	i have the totem plugin installed now, that does not work either -- i am trying to listen to the radio from a local station -- they actually have a faq that answers the question of what to do when in linux -- they recommend using mplayer -- also does not work for me...
2007-02-18T08:14:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	i was able to play the stream with vlc standalone but i really want the plugin to work and am becoming obsessed with getting it working -- spending toooooo much time though
2007-02-18T08:14:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	guess we have to wait for Feisty.. Dapper even had problem with Flash sounds, but it's ok now in Edgy:) things are improving
2007-02-18T08:15:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	if you tried totem and vlc, that still leaves you with mozilla-mplayer and gxineplugin untried
2007-02-18T08:18:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	okay -- different subject same topic (multimedia) do you use rythmbox?  i have been using banshee for my ipod/mp3 stuff -- but ubuntu has defaulted with rythmbox.... i am not sure which to use now -- i have them both installed
2007-02-18T08:20:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i use movie player for music i guess... rythmbox is fine though... you may wanna look on that revolution player too.. but be warned it installs mozilla wich will take over your browser system default
2007-02-18T08:21:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	thanks for the advice :)
2007-02-18T08:24:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	sorry, i meant http://www.getdemocracy.com/
2007-02-18T08:25:00.000Z	bdina	wrox	i have thought about trying the democracy player -- i did balk at the deps
2007-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	wrox	bdina	i installed, seen my firefox replaced by mozilla and uninstalled immediatelly:)) guess i should just switch the default browser next time
