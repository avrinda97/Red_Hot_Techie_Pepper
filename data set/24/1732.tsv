2009-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	Alan502		My audio card is not detected! It is on windows but i lost my audio card in kubuntu, kde even prompted me to remove the drivers as they were "no longer necessary"
2009-12-24T07:44:00.000Z	Alan502		what could be the possible reasons?
2009-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	try running: aplay -l
2009-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	that will list all possible audio devices, or should
2009-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Use pastebin.ubuntu.com to show the results
2009-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	damn, mom calling for dinner, will you still be here in 30 mins?
2009-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Perhaps, if not some one else should know. You may also want to try #kubuntu (since ur running that)
2009-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	ok, i'll be back, thanks :)
2009-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	back
2009-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	i'm pasting my aplay -l input now
2009-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Try running some of the tests they did on this posting: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1144923 and ok. :)
2009-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	http://paste.ubuntu.com/345672/
2009-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Also "/join #kubuntu" since your using Kubuntu, ubuntu is not the support for this distro specifically. :/
2009-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	ok i'm posting my problem there too
2009-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Ok, I hope they can help you out. I had a client who had an Intel audio chip just like you and it seemed to stop working entirely on 9.10 I think it may be a bug, 9.04 worked perfectly. :(
2009-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	my chip is intel as well, are you suggesting i change back to 9.04?
2009-12-24T08:08:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Worst case scenario, but you may want to file a bug at launchpad if we can prove it's a bug. See what the other guys say at #kubuntu first.
2009-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	i still have like 15 updates left tho
2009-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	 i haden't updated for about to weeks... so i don't think the updates where the problem
2009-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	but anyway, updating could solve it
2009-12-24T08:10:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Hmm yes, running sudo apt-get updates might resolve the issue then
2009-12-24T08:10:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Or just running your default updater application, I believe Kubuntu has one as does ubuntu
2009-12-24T08:15:00.000Z	Alan502	Gaming4JC	yeah it does, i'll see if there is something related with audio in the updates
2009-12-24T08:16:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Alan502	Ok, gl. :)
