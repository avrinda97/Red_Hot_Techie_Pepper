2008-05-20T18:27:00.000Z	Yo`		thanks v let for support

2008-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	Yo`		everytime i get the error message
2008-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	Yo`		FYI i am new with linux
2008-05-20T18:29:00.000Z	Yo`		yes Pici
2008-05-20T18:29:00.000Z	Yo`		i am only having this version on this machine
2008-05-20T18:29:00.000Z	Vlet	Yo`	you're probably best off just backing up all your personal documents or whatever to a cd or thumb drive or somewhere else, and just install Hardy
2008-05-20T18:30:00.000Z	Yo`		i have no problems sid
2008-05-20T18:30:00.000Z	Yo`		i am doing this breezy on very old hardrive
2008-05-20T18:30:00.000Z	Yo`		 i dont know it can take a pain of any more formatting
2008-05-20T18:30:00.000Z	Vlet	Yo`	just because it's an old computer doesn't mean you have to use old software.
2008-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	Yo`		ok vlet
2008-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	Yo`		i have some edgy version lying around
2008-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	Vlet	Yo`	use hardy. It's not like it's slower; just more refined.
2008-05-20T18:32:00.000Z	Yo`		i have glib-2.14.0 with me
2008-05-20T18:32:00.000Z	Yo`		but i am not able to do make or make install
2008-05-20T18:33:00.000Z	Yo`		i have edited source file
2008-05-20T18:33:00.000Z	Yo`		and now trying contrib
2008-05-20T18:34:00.000Z	Vlet	Yo`	nothing you do will fix the problem. The repositories for your version are gone, and the packages for the newer versions won't work with your system. You have ONLY two choices: use the system as it is now without any updates ever, or install hardy
2008-05-20T18:34:00.000Z	Yo`		ok can i print the screen here
2008-05-20T18:35:00.000Z	Yo`	Vlet	can i listen to mp3 files on this system?
