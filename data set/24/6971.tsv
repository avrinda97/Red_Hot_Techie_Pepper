2005-09-05T09:16:00.000Z	bob2		bear in mind that "ac97" is not a modem
2005-09-05T09:16:00.000Z	bob2		it's a device to play sounds into a phoneline
2005-09-05T09:16:00.000Z	bob2		your CPU has to be the actual modem
2005-09-05T09:16:00.000Z	bob2		so go pay linuxant for drivers
2005-09-05T09:17:00.000Z	bob2		do you mean "boot flag"?
2005-09-05T09:17:00.000Z	CCFIEL	bob2	ahh..ic....i think not an conexant modem...
2005-09-05T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	I assume this is a laptop?

2005-09-05T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	http://linux-laptop.net/
2005-09-05T09:20:00.000Z	CCFIEL	bob2	my laptop is not listed in that site.. does it mean its not supported?
2005-09-05T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	of course not, it means you need to go do some research yourself
2005-09-05T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	what did google say about getting your modem working?
2005-09-05T09:21:00.000Z	CCFIEL	bob2	i have research...for 2 days now..i have no luck...im stuck...
2005-09-05T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	so, your question should have been "I hadva SiS ac97 modem in my $foobar laptop."
2005-09-05T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	what for?
2005-09-12T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	there isn't one, it's calling nautilus
2005-09-12T09:24:00.000Z	CCFIEL	bob2	ic coz im transfering to another window system xfce because my computer is low in memory. can nautilus run in xfce??
2005-09-12T09:25:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	yes, but it will start lots of gnome, too
2005-09-12T09:25:00.000Z	bob2	CCFIEL	just mount the filesystem if you're going to use it
2005-09-12T09:25:00.000Z	CCFIEL	bob2	ok thanks
