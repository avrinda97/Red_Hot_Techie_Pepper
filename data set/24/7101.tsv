2005-04-23T07:23:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	create a shell script in /etc/X11/Xsession.d
2005-04-23T07:24:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	Xsession is like profile for console/xterm envs
2005-04-23T07:35:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	can you point me to docs about Xsession.d ?
2005-04-23T07:41:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=65800#post65800 , i guess the ubuntu link is the best fitted there :)
2005-04-23T07:42:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	though if you want i have a load of unreadable docs about profile and unix (something liek the graal quest)
2005-04-23T07:48:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	i'd want the unreadble docs too. the more info, the better :)
2005-04-23T07:53:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	still loading the 40 bookmarks ... i have not made a policy with those yet (i hope you will :)
2005-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	do you read french ?
2005-04-23T07:58:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	no, only english and hebrew.
2005-04-23T08:15:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	sorry it will take too long , it is a mess there
2005-04-23T08:17:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	np.
2005-04-23T08:18:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	you can find some random data in m17n  ML and an implementation of an Xsession per user in m17n-env
2005-04-23T08:22:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	thanks, i think i understand now why putting scripts in Xsession.d works: they're sourced, not executed.
2005-04-23T08:23:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	yes but there is stil a problem , it is systm wide , m17n-env script take care of that (you can put scripts in ~/.xsession.d )
2005-04-23T08:24:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	that's ok, the systemwide script only sources the scripts in ~/.xsession.d :)
2005-04-23T08:25:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	yes and it is also secure as at this stage the X server run with the user permissions (no problem with user gaining root permissions in a script)
2005-04-23T08:26:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	you mean those scripts once ran with root permissions?
2005-04-23T08:27:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	i mean it was not obvious (there are no official docs for the Xsession )
2005-04-23T08:29:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	why aren't there? i'm sure i'm not the first to want to set a $PATH that'll apply to X too..
2005-04-23T08:30:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	because debian is the first to do it, if you want i have examples of the way aix, RH and a few others does ... i guess so few people understand X as a whole that the XSF was the first to think of Xsession
2005-04-23T08:32:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	yes, i'd like to know how other systems do this.
2005-04-23T08:32:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	you can write one , maybe as a small wiki page on ubuntu site will give it the needed momentum
2005-04-23T08:40:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	prahal	thanks.
2005-04-23T08:42:00.000Z	prahal	H0lyD4wg	that refreshed my memry, HP use ~/.vueprofile and aix ~/.dtprofile ...
