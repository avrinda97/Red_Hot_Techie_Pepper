2007-01-21T17:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		hi... my friend's computer is randomly freezing
2007-01-21T17:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		any ideas? it freezes mostly when a program is started,
2007-01-21T17:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		like firefox, etc
2007-01-21T17:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		they are on breezy, but we booted into edgy liveCD and it does the same
2007-01-21T17:07:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	how much ram does the system have?
2007-01-21T17:07:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		it just started doing that, was working fine for 5 months or so
2007-01-21T17:07:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n2diy	256
2007-01-21T17:08:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	ah, ok, 256 is ok.
2007-01-21T17:08:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		any ideas on how i can disable the sound card without BIOS?
2007-01-21T17:08:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		might be some hardware issue
2007-01-21T17:09:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		also, can i check memory from within ubuntu without rebooting?
2007-01-21T17:09:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	not unless there is a jumper for it on the mom board?
2007-01-21T17:09:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		something like memtest
2007-01-21T17:09:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	did you run memtest?
2007-01-21T17:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n2diy	no i can't use keyboard when rebooting
2007-01-21T17:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n2diy	so i cant select memtest
2007-01-21T17:10:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	can you substitute the keyboard with another one?
2007-01-21T17:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n2diy	i would do that if i can
2007-01-21T17:11:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		but i cant
2007-01-21T17:12:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	Not being able to use the keyboard at boot is a problem, and that could be the problem.
2007-01-21T17:12:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n2diy	its a USB keyboard
2007-01-21T17:12:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		wireless
2007-01-21T17:12:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		i don't have access to it, it for a friend
2007-01-21T17:13:00.000Z	n2diy	pppoe_dude	well, you know he has a problem with the keyboard, that needs to fixed before you can troubleshoot anything else.
