2007-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, Yep.
2007-01-21T09:59:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, but wait, I run the development version of Ubuntu (Feisty fawn to be)
2007-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	sometimes the lan works and sometimes it doesn't
2007-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, Yep, thats exactly what I am facing!
2007-01-21T10:01:00.000Z	pmc_asad_		oh, any ideas?
2007-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, I am checking on #ubuntu+1
2007-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	ok let me know
2007-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, Not sure. But LKLM has similar stories.
2007-01-21T10:03:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad,  http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2006-12/msg00479.html
2007-01-21T10:06:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	If I turn off my pc and unplug the power source for about aminute, it works after that. But it seems like a stupid solution
2007-01-21T10:07:00.000Z	harsha-		pmc_asad, I guess I have the same issue.  But I reboot my ADSL router to get back my connection.
2007-01-21T10:08:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	I'm on a LAN in my colony. I can't do that. Lets hope they fix the problem in fiesty fawn
2007-01-21T10:09:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	Ah, lets hope it gets fixed
2007-01-21T10:09:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	so far the only distro I have tried that automatically pics it up properly is Mandriva one and PCLinuxOS
2007-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	 I tried FC5 from another partition to see whether it was with the connection or with my PC. I noticed that it was with my system.
2007-01-21T10:10:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	btw, what kernel do you run? 'Cause I never faced it before. I only faced it after my upgrade to Feisty.
2007-01-21T10:11:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	that sucks, but my LAn works fine in mandriva, I think it has something to do with the forcedeth drivers
2007-01-21T10:12:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	what is the version of your Ubuntu kernel?
2007-01-21T10:12:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	not sure. Whatever comes default with 6.06
2007-01-21T10:12:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	can you paste the output of uname -a ?
2007-01-21T10:13:00.000Z	pmc_asad_	harsha-	no, I'm in windows and ubuntu is not installed right now
2007-01-21T10:13:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	Ok. np.
2007-01-21T10:17:00.000Z	pmc_asad_		I can't get 32 bit version of ubuntu to install on MD 64 X2...any suggestions?
2007-01-21T10:18:00.000Z	harsha-	pmc_asad_	 I was just looking, and I think 2.6.20-rc4-mm1/ has a lot of forcedeth fixes.
