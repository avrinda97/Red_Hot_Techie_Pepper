2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	awilcox		hehehe
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	awilcox		actually, this thing has been buggering out on me since December 22nd
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	awilcox		that's the one I use, not sure which one it is
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	awilcox		/bin/sh, so prolly dash
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	awilcox		puh, months ago
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	awilcox		so I cp -r'd the home directory to the new mount point, for some reason it didn't even mount /dev/hda8 to /tmp so I didn't have to erase anything, I just formatted it and reset it.  well I put two 8s into fstab so it came up in maintenance mode saying fstab is broke.  so I fixed it.  then it said bad FS type, I forgot to put ext3, so I reformatted and recopied EVERYTHING again
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	awilcox		then I was finally able to almost log in; I typed my password in, then it said "could not run ksomething; check your installation" and then I tried doing it again after resetting the permissions.  it went black, then it went back to the password prompt, then I typed again, then it went back to the prompt after going black for a second
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	awilcox		When I did sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop and then startx from the command line, Xorg caught sig11
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	awilcox		^ Asc, there ya go!
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	What's the output of "ls -ld ~ /tmp" ?
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	still curious: What's the output of "ls -ld ~ /tmp" ?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	I said already, it never got the /tmp mount point, stupid setup didn't know it WAS to mount at /tmp
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	So you're trying to start X without a /tmp ?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	no ti's on /
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	What's on /?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	So you do have a /tmp.
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	yes, just not a separate partition
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	So tell me what that command prints.
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	Yes.

2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	Everything looks fine. That's not the problem thenl sorry to bother you.
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	not a bother
