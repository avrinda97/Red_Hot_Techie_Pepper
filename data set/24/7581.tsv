2006-01-14T06:33:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Hey buddy!
2006-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	I've got a bit of a ppp problem in dapper, interested in hearing about it?
2006-01-14T06:34:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	I can hear, but I haven't used a modem for years
2006-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	nothing at all in syslog?
2006-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Not a thing at all, which confuses me, as debug is on
2006-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	that was my next question..
2006-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	hm, the ppp package hasn't been touched for about 4 weeks in dapper
2006-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	search bugzilla
2006-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	the official move still hasn't been done
2006-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Yeah. It worked for me 5 days before christmas, then not on the day before christmas.
2006-01-14T06:37:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2006-01-14T06:38:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	not running anything special, it's just a boring old modem?
2006-01-14T06:40:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	how are you online right now? breezy or another box?
2006-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	So same computer, but with 802.11G.
2006-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Also in a probably unrelated note from about the same time, my built in dvdrw stopped working.
2006-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	right, and running 'pppd call <provider> debug' does what?
2006-01-14T06:46:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Ok, adding nodetach to peers/provider makes things work, but it of course keeps the pty
2006-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	regardless, syslog doesn't get anything in any case
2006-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	so it's just logging broken?
2006-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Thats what I'm seeing, yes. Before now though, I could have _SWORN_ that ppp0 never comes up though.
2006-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	So apparently whatever the problem may have been, now its just a case of logging being broken
2006-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	ajmitch	jblack	it's an improvement at least - probably still worth a bugreport
2006-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	jblack	ajmitch	Aye.
