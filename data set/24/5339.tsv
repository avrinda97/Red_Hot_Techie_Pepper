2006-12-02T12:51:00.000Z	ivx		hey is there a limit to how much ram ubuntu can support, and will it support sata
2006-12-02T12:52:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	it supports a lot of sata chipsets.  not sure about the ram limit, but its assuredly pretty high
2006-12-02T12:52:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	so if i get some sata hds you think it will be good?
2006-12-02T12:53:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	you need to find out the chipset that runs the sata on your motherboard.  im running of an nforce sata drive as we speak.
2006-12-02T12:54:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	unless its obscure or really new, i wouldn't fear that its not supported, it probably is.
2006-12-02T12:54:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	i am thinking of buying http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2665520&sku=MBM-RD480-3700
2006-12-02T12:56:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	thats a uli southbridge.  it will work for sure.
2006-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	cool, I got an okay job so I finally can start playing with this stuff
2006-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	thanks
2006-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	no worries, building a desktop machine?
2006-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	no, a server that isn't going to be that busy, so that should be plenty
2006-12-02T12:57:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	can i give you some unsolicited hardware advice/
2006-12-02T12:58:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	yes, i would love it, just rember i am trying to keep it cheap
2006-12-02T12:58:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	i would go with an AM2 motherboard cause thats the future, and DDR2 ram tends to be a little cheaper
2006-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	yeah i don't know it i can get an am2 for cheap, i was kinda thinking get a board that supports duo core and pentiumd, and just run a pentium d for now
2006-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	or what ever has the same socket number
2006-12-02T13:00:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	for sure, and if its not that busy, you don't need much cpu horsepower anyway
2006-12-02T13:01:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	well the one i got now has dual pIII 600 mhz, with 128 rdram. so anything will beat that
2006-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	haha, for sure.  i use an old pIII as a server as well.
2006-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	yeah i got it off ebay for 30 shipped :)
2006-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	excellent
2006-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	well it was for a month, now it can't really handle the requests. anyway thanks
2006-12-02T13:03:00.000Z	princemackenzie	ivx	no problem
2006-12-02T13:53:00.000Z	ivx	princemackenzie	oh I just read that that mother board support am2
