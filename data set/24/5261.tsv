2008-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	nathan_		Do you know if 8.10 has any better support for Atheros Wireless Cards?
2008-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	nathan_		Oops meant scunizi
2008-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	not sure but my bet is it will be.
2008-12-03T08:48:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	see above ^--^
2008-12-03T08:49:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	System>Admin>synaptic
2008-12-03T08:54:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	click the search button and type in nvidia.. there will be lots of things.. just scroll to the nvidia section and you'll see it.
2008-12-03T08:56:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	no just the legacy one
2008-12-03T08:57:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	also have you looked at system>admin>hardware drivers? might already be listed there.
2008-12-03T09:01:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	did you get the driver enabled?
2008-12-03T09:01:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	open a terminal and type glxgears.. do you see anything?
2008-12-03T09:02:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	Applications>accessories
2008-12-03T09:05:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	good you're almost there.. close the gears window and do what winston_ said.. glxinfo | grep direct
2008-12-03T09:05:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	type that in the terminal
2008-12-03T09:07:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	were you able to enable the restricted drivers in system>admin>hardware drivers?
2008-12-03T09:09:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	got them going?  your next question will probably be how to get the cube working....
2009-06-21T18:02:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	yes.. but I work out of the house
2009-06-21T18:03:00.000Z	nathan_	scunizi	any suggestions to maximise ubuntu potential
2009-06-21T18:06:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	depends.. install and learn the programs that make life easier for what you do.  explore options or additions like a lamp server in a virtual machine so you don't muck up your primary system
2009-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	use a seperate /home for your data.. it makes it easier for upgrades or reinstalls
2009-06-21T18:08:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	np :)
2009-11-05T09:40:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	reinstall..
2009-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	nathan_	scunizi	without actually reinstalling :p
2009-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	not that I'm aware of..
2009-11-05T09:42:00.000Z	scunizi	nathan_	an almost easy method is to mirror your partitions just after install and all the updates..
