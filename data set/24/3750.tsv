2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	joanki		sometimes when i am just on the internet or doing something miscellaneous, my system gets VERY slow as if something huge is running.  any reason why?
2007-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	joanki		and my fan goes crazy
2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	joanki		yes it does
2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	joanki		and i see my network history usage spike
2007-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	joanki		but i barely did ANYTHING
2007-10-22T07:01:00.000Z	joanki		i wonder if i an a guinea pig for 7.10 gusty
2007-10-22T07:01:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	I feel the same darn way, i cant do crap, and i dont know whats wrong
2007-10-22T07:02:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	i would say so, because all 7.10 has brought me is nothing but anger and a screwed up OS
2007-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	what version did you have before gusty
2007-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	7.04,went to upgrade to 7.10 upgrade failed, OS got bent over =\
2007-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	did you like 7.04
2007-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	yeah, but i wanted to get 7.10 because it had supported desktop effects and such, along with more security and stuff :P
2007-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	i think they will fix the bugs though
2007-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	thats nice, but i dont have a computer now =\
2007-10-22T07:05:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	nothing works?
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	nothing works, when i boot up it hits loading screen, after that it just fails, and restarts
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	so now im just going to try and backup my data with 7.10 LiveCD, but it wont even work
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	what is the biggest concern right n ow
2007-10-22T07:07:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	my data on my hard drive, if i can get that back ill just go back to 7.04 or XP because this has just been hell
2007-10-22T07:07:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	no one here can help you?
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	danny3794	joanki	most likely not, i have had at minimum 4-5 people help me, i have been reading the forums for about 3 days, and i have found nothing, im just about ready to throw the damn thing into my burn pit and light er up
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	joanki	danny3794	maybe you can send wirechief a message
