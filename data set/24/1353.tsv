2010-02-25T05:31:00.000Z	madjoe		Here's an easy question: is mplayer and standard Movie player that comes preinstalled with Ubuntu = same players?
2010-02-25T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	no
2010-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	just use a symlink
2010-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	any special flags I should use?
2010-03-25T14:18:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	no, ln -s TARGET NAME.  Or just rigth click -> create symlink (or whatever it says)
2010-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	so?
2010-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	it would be much easier to be able to navigate with "cd .." within my original dirname...
2010-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	you probably just want to use an alias, I don't see your use case
2010-03-25T14:26:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	no, not an alias.. my use case would be something like this: when I'm located in my ~/Downloads, I'd like to be able to quickly move files to different locations, such as "/var/www/home/sites/all/themes/mytheme/images"
2010-03-25T14:27:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	what's wrong with using a symlink in that case?
2010-03-25T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	or just store the long path in some variable and then do mv whatever_file $my_long_path
2010-03-25T14:28:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	I'd use links for that - like "mv filename linkname", but when I "cd linkname", I'm not able to navigate throught my "/var/www" path with "cd .." - maybe I should use both... alias AND links... hmmm.. but it's just weird
2010-03-25T14:30:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	well I think in zsh you can have cd aliases, but really I think your solution is to just save the path in some short variable...
2010-03-25T14:31:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	well, that's not such an improvement comparing with symlinks... or am I missing something big here?
2010-03-25T14:31:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	why not?  cd $my_path, mv whatever_file $my_path
2010-03-25T14:31:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	you could ask #bash if there's a better way
2010-03-25T14:31:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	oh, cd $my_path WILL work as I expect! right!
2010-03-25T14:43:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	that doesn't do what you want...
2010-03-25T14:44:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	I've been suggested on #bash
2010-03-25T14:44:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	I understand, but you can't use that to move files, and you can't use it with cd.  It's about the same as having an alias
2010-03-25T14:46:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	yes, I just tested it... bummer.
2010-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	"my applications"?
2010-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	madjoe	jrib	all the applications I've installed on my Karmic
2010-09-22T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	madjoe	when you upgrade, they are kept
