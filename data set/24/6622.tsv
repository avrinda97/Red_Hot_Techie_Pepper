2005-11-18T12:51:00.000Z	zoexii		hey, I have questions about gcc:  Is it possible to have multiple versions installed at once?  it looks like synaptic will let me do this..  Is it a bad idea?
2005-11-18T12:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	not really, it's okay.
2005-11-18T12:58:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	adriyel, gnomefreak, you all seem to know many things about gcc's... I just finished installing gcc 3.4, yet the configure file for qemu gives a warning that gcc appears to be 4.x...  Is there a trick to get it to see version 3.4 ?
2005-11-18T12:59:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	try export $CC= <path to your gcc>
2005-11-18T13:01:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	what is the default path to my gcc?  I'm guessing it is in /usr/bin?
2005-11-18T13:04:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	i sure hope so :)
2005-11-18T13:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
2005-11-18T13:08:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	trappist, ok tried those two, it returns "no alternatives for gcc"
2005-11-18T13:10:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	export $CC= <path to your gcc> I think I had a syntax problem trying this, it returned something about "not a valid identifier."
2005-11-18T13:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	one sec
2005-11-18T13:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	 try  export CC=<your gcc>
2005-11-18T13:15:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	with the "<>"s correct?
2005-11-18T13:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	no, without the <>'s
2005-11-18T13:21:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	ok, I am looking inside the configure file, and I think maybe it checks for the presence of gcc 4.x, and then prints an error regardless of wheter gcc 3.x is available.  I'm not sure.  If you don't mind looking I can paste what I'm looking at in #flood
2005-11-18T13:21:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	use the pastebin,
2005-11-18T13:21:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	it will stay aournd for a while then
2005-11-18T13:22:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	pastebin?
2005-11-18T13:25:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	right on, I pasted it there, it's definately the part of the config file that produces the error message, but I'm not certain of how it works or how to interpret it.
2005-11-18T13:26:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	./configure --help | less' and/or README or INSTALL file
2005-11-18T13:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	plus, tell me the url to the pastebin
2005-11-18T13:28:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4494
2005-11-18T13:30:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	./configure --disable-gcc-check
2005-11-18T13:31:00.000Z	zoexii	robotgeek	ok, was I right then? about it displaying the error regardless of whetere 3.x was available?
2005-11-18T13:32:00.000Z	robotgeek	zoexii	yeah, it checks for gcc 4.0, and doesn't check your CC, i guess
