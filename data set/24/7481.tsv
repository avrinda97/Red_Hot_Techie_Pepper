2008-02-18T08:13:00.000Z	billytwowilly		I have windows vista  currently. I blew away gutsy already.
2008-02-18T08:13:00.000Z	billytwowilly		I suppose I could boot into windows and use fdisk /mbr
2008-02-18T08:13:00.000Z	billytwowilly		oh yah, is 32 bit linux as lame about more than 2 GB of ram as windows is?
2008-02-18T08:14:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	no
2008-02-18T08:16:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	replace with a windows mbr you mean? not just "blow away"
2008-02-18T08:16:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	no I don't care what it does. I just want it gone. Doesn't have to be windows mbr, just has to have current mbr obliterated.
2008-02-18T08:18:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	so write zeroes to it using dd
2008-02-18T08:18:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	ok, how do I do that?
2008-02-18T08:19:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	you need to retain the partition table though?
2008-02-18T08:20:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	yes, I need the partition table.
2008-02-18T08:21:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	I think dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/yourdrive bs=466 count=1   would do it, I think..
2008-02-18T08:21:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	that should erase the code area of the MBR, according to wikipedia
2008-02-18T08:22:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	You don't sound very confident;)
2008-02-18T08:22:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	well the mbr contains the partition table as well, but I'm pretty sure the partition table is the last 66 bytes of the 512B mbr
2008-02-18T08:23:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	to be safe, you could dd if=/dev/yourdrive of=mbr_backup.img bs=512 count=1  and copy it off somewhere safe
2008-02-18T08:24:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	then write the zeroes, and if it somehow fails miserably, just write the backup back ala dd if=mbr_backup.img of=/dev/yourdrive
2008-02-18T08:24:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	Sweet! I think that did it!
2008-02-18T08:26:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	for using linux since it was 2 years old, one would think you'd be more familiar with dd, but I'm glad it worked ;)
2008-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	crap, you're right, it was 97 ish, which is 11 years, not the better part of 15
2008-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	heh, about when I started I think
2008-02-18T08:29:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	actually 1999 for me, now that I check the SuSE release history
2008-02-18T08:29:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	I don't think suse was even around when I started using linux...
2008-02-18T08:30:00.000Z	Klowner	billytwowilly	1.0 in '94
2008-02-18T08:31:00.000Z	billytwowilly	Klowner	mine was redhat 4.2 or 5. It was crap;)
