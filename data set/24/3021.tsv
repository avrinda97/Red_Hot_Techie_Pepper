2008-05-22T14:21:00.000Z	papegaaij		can anybody explain how to get the version i want available in synaptic?
2008-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	papegaaij		doh :)
2008-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	you'd have to enable a repository that has the older version.
2008-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	why don't you first explain the problem you're trying to fix
2008-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	this is the problem http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=479073
2008-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	when i look in the pool/main/s/samba directory on nl.archive.ubuntu.com, i see plenty of versions, why can't i select one of those?
2008-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	because they are part of previous versions of ubuntu.
2008-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	ah, ok, so when i add a gusty rep, i should be able to select the gutsy version of these packages?
2008-05-22T14:26:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	from a distributor's point of view, if you allow a mix of versions, you have to allow a mix of dependency, which is the road to hell.
2008-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	in principle, yes. But please make sure that it's absolutely unavoidable before you go down this path.
2008-05-22T14:27:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	maybe you can just update the server in question?
2008-05-22T14:28:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	i'm afraid there is no fix yet for this bug, so also no updates
2008-05-22T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	consider  also what VSpike said
2008-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	have you tried mount -t cifs ?
2008-05-22T14:31:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	not yet
2008-05-22T14:32:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	i'll give it a try
2008-05-22T14:34:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	what package provides mount.cifs?
2008-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	smbfs
2008-05-22T14:41:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	mount.cifs seems to work
2008-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	so you're happy?
2008-05-22T14:49:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	ok, the problem is fixed now, it seems i needed some obscure config option in smb.conf
2008-05-22T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	papegaaij	I'm glad you didn't get yourself into a mixed gutsy-hardy mess
2008-05-22T14:50:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	so am i :)
2008-05-22T14:54:00.000Z	papegaaij	soundray	thanks for your help
