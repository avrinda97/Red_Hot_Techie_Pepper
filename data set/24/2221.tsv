2009-03-06T07:17:00.000Z	coreyman		So I put a new partition into fstab, and i told it to mount at /home ... when i try to log in, it says Cannot enter home directory.  Using /. So I entered failsafe and edited fstab to mount the disk in /mnt but I still get the error, what am i doing wrong.
2009-03-06T07:19:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	have you confirmed that the partition is getting mounted ?
2009-03-06T07:24:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	ok
2009-03-06T07:34:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	cannot move /home to /old_home : device or resource busy, how do i make it unbusy >.>
2009-03-06T07:39:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	generally that means the a terminal is 'cd' to somewhere in '/home'
2009-03-06T07:39:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	yea, how do i cd out.
2009-03-06T07:39:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	or do i just load from live cd
2009-03-06T07:44:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	cd to somewhere else like 'cd /'
2009-03-06T07:47:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	i booted into live disc, permission denied moving all files in /old/home to /new/ find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /new/
2009-03-06T07:50:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	ok,   what does "ls -ld /new' return?
2009-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	did you sort out your problem?
2009-03-06T09:07:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	pretty much, but new problem i am working on resolving myself, since it was nearly working earlier and i broke it and i need to get back to that nearly working state so i can try something i found
2009-03-06T09:11:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	good!  I have been having hardware troubles myself.
2009-03-06T09:11:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	oops! that sounded bad.
2009-03-06T09:15:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	sweet, i got further now.
2009-03-06T09:15:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	seemed my mount point did not exist >.>
2009-03-06T09:16:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	ok.  don't forget to check the premissions of the mount point once you have done the mount.
2009-03-06T09:18:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	yea i just had to change that.
2009-03-06T09:18:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	from recovery mode
2009-03-06T09:20:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	what troubles are you havin
2009-03-06T09:33:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	all sorts of messages when booting, saying ata4.0 is having trouble, and a very slow boot.
2009-03-06T09:33:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	oh, sounds hardware related.
2009-03-06T09:36:00.000Z	neil_d	coreyman	yes!  but as this is the second new drive, that its reporting trouble with, and it an old motherboard, and I have been having trouble for the last 6 months,
2009-03-06T09:36:00.000Z	coreyman	neil_d	i would suspect mobo then
