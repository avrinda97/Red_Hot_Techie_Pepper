2011-03-08T19:35:00.000Z	duckstar		I have some questions about .mkv playback containing what i think is VC-1 codec not playing in mplayer / vlc/ xbmc  is this the right place to be asking them ?
2011-03-08T19:37:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	if it doesn't play in mplayer its most likely un-supported. mplayer has been able to play anything I have thrown at it. If it can play it, its most likely a bad encoding.

2011-03-08T19:38:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 Thanks for the reply.  I got the file from somewhere that confirms its working.  When i try and play the file using the mplayer test.mkv command it starts loading the file and then says Seek failed.
2011-03-08T19:39:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 Also when trying to play it in XBMC it trys to play it as a audio file, but i think that is because XBMC does not support VC-1
2011-03-08T19:41:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	in my experience if it says seek failed it normally means that its a incomplete file.
2011-03-08T19:41:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	or its missing some sort of important headder
2011-03-08T19:42:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	,bluekaJ  But don't worry the questions dont end there..
2011-03-08T19:49:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	I have played 1080p mkv files .. They work fine but use a bit of cpu. You really need a fast computer to keep up with the codec
2011-03-08T19:51:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 Surely it would be some sort of codec problem if they work fine in xbmc ?
2011-03-08T19:51:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 i run XBMC in the same session, not in its only session
2011-03-08T19:51:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	most likely btw where are you getting these videos from anyway
2011-03-08T19:52:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	I get them from Usenet
2011-03-08T19:53:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	its possible that the format is just messed up on thoes piticular files.
2011-03-08T19:56:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 i am just testing between all the vieo files i have.  It seems any 720p or under works fine in vlc but anything 1080p isn't.  In XBMC everything plays.  Is there a cache setting that is maybe choking me ? since i am streaming these off  mount NAS drives
2011-03-08T19:57:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	alright .. try  mplayer -cache 80000 /path/to/file
2011-03-08T19:57:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	I stream 1080p off of NFS and it works fine .. usually 1 to 2 MB/s though of data
2011-03-08T20:02:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	Takes ages to type the paths.  is there some sort of auto fill ?  like type the first part in then let the terminal autofill ?
2011-03-08T20:03:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	tab and dubble tab
2011-03-08T20:03:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 Cheers.  Nope its still laggy
2011-03-08T20:03:00.000Z	duckstar	nn102400	 Less Laggy..
2011-03-08T20:03:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	tab fills in ... dubble tab lists everything int that directory that is under the characters you already have down
2011-03-08T20:05:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	my experience is that broken formats usually spit out a lot of junk on the terminal about broken crc or somthing like that .. and dont play right with a lot of skips and glitches
2011-03-08T20:05:00.000Z	nn102400	duckstar	if its not the format try the -frameskip option to speed up the sound.
