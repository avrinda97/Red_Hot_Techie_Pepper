2009-01-21T20:16:00.000Z	james296		can anyone here help me change the menu icon next to the Applications area?
2009-01-21T20:17:00.000Z	james296		like Im using the gnome-human icon theme
2009-01-21T20:19:00.000Z	james296		just for one icon?
2009-01-21T20:19:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	i dont know if i remember it exactly but if i am not wrong the name of the icon is something like gnome-desktop-icon or something like that. i think you can find it in /usr/share/gnome/ try finding it and replace it
2009-01-21T20:22:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	ok here is the way
2009-01-21T20:23:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	open gconf-editor
2009-01-21T20:23:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	go to apps>panel>objects in gconf-editor
2009-01-21T20:24:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	check the option "use custom icon" and select your icon
2009-01-21T20:24:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	you have to find menu-object there
2009-01-21T20:25:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	find menu-object and select the option "use custom icon" and select your own
2009-01-21T20:26:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	let me check one minute
2009-01-21T20:27:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	ok do this in terminal : locate distributor-logo
2009-01-21T20:28:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	find the path to the logo of your theme. the one that you are using. and replace it there. you can use in terminal : sudo cp /path/to your logo.svg /path/to the logo in the theme.svg
2009-01-21T20:29:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	i found mine in /home/snake/.icons/hydroxygen/22x22/places/distributor-logo.png
2009-01-21T20:30:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	so try checking yours in .icons folder. and look carefully to your size. i dont know what size ar you using
2009-01-21T20:31:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	if it has to be 24X24 than change that one
2009-01-21T20:32:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	it worked for me in this way. i had the gnome foot before and i have the ubuntu logo now
2009-01-21T20:34:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	i dont know that. maybe yes
2009-01-21T20:34:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	sorry
2009-01-21T20:34:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	sorry no
2009-01-21T20:34:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	dont do it. i know you have to do some command to update the icons but i dont remember it
2009-01-21T20:38:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	i am happy for you :)
2009-01-21T20:39:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	i use the ubuntu logo. :)
2009-01-21T20:40:00.000Z	albuntu	james296	yes. it seems a little more near to the menu
