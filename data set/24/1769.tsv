2011-04-27T21:02:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	Not everyone is running Ubuntu desktop here.
2011-04-27T21:03:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	He said 10.04.1, guess that's what threw me.
2011-04-27T23:51:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	looks like you're rather busy the day before a release... It's all good. :-)
2011-05-31T18:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	Even if you put the pamerror in the topic, most would miss it... :-(
2011-05-31T18:41:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	Which is why I haven't :/
2011-06-22T22:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	gertidon  Interesting some of my jpegs are different colors from one another; I never really paid much attention, but it is curious.
2011-07-06T16:26:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	Thats not helpful.
2011-07-06T16:27:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	ayaya...?
2011-07-06T16:27:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	what?
2011-07-06T16:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	Sorry, I misread his aya...as play; won't happen again. I should pay closer attention. :-)
2011-07-06T16:29:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	tis okay :)
2011-07-27T17:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	I almost answered "tux" but I wasn't clear on his question; correct me, please, if I'm wrong but, isn't the password, when running from a LiveCD, "ubuntu"?
2011-07-27T17:17:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	Someone elsewhere suggested that, didn't work.  I didn't think there was one personally.
2011-07-27T17:18:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	OK, thanks. :-)
2011-09-01T16:26:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	Wow, there's two; never knew about the hashes factoid. :-)
2011-09-09T17:11:00.000Z	Pici	Sidewinder1	coraxx: Canonical aren't really the folks to talk to about this.  I suggest you drop into #ubuntu-community-team and discuss your ideas there.
2011-12-23T20:31:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	I think that r4y was speaking to pitlimit and stating that unity/linux, like many things takes some time to learn, :D
2012-03-12T18:39:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Pici	Beat 'ya. ;-)
