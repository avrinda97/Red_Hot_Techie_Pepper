2012-07-27T23:11:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		Question abt partitioning (gparted) - I'm running a Wubi install - I recently added a new hdd
2012-07-27T23:12:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		Under gparted I see three devices sda sdb and sdc
2012-07-27T23:12:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		I'm thinking sdc is the new hdd I added - how do I make sure that it indeed was the last added hdd?
2012-07-27T23:12:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		\like form dmesg / equivalent?
2012-07-27T23:13:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		Any ideas y'all?
2012-07-27T23:14:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		but being pedantic
2012-07-27T23:14:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		there must be a way - to see the last added device right ?
2012-07-27T23:14:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder		dmesg
2012-07-27T23:14:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	dmesg should tell you, also, you could check previous boots in  /var/log/messages, see what the UUID of the old drive is?  I think it shows up in there.
2012-07-27T23:14:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	hmm - let me chk them
2012-07-27T23:30:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	http://pastebin.com/WWRhG8im
2012-07-27T23:30:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	How do I know from here which was the last added disk ?
2012-07-27T23:33:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	Were both discs in when you botted?
2012-07-27T23:34:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	Actually 3 disk - I already had 2 disks - the 3rd disk was added in - all unfortunately 160gigs
2012-07-27T23:34:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	Added after boot time, or before boot time?
2012-07-27T23:34:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	before
2012-07-27T23:35:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	Um.  Strange, I don't see any info in there.  Is there anything on the new drive?
2012-07-27T23:35:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	Shouldn't be
2012-07-27T23:36:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	Then just type fdisk -l, and the one with no partitions should be it.
2012-07-27T23:36:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	if there's nothing on it, there might not BE a 1 partition.
2012-07-27T23:37:00.000Z	kyle__	OptimizedCoder	But then again there might be.  Give it a shot.
2012-07-27T23:38:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	http://pastebin.com/Kaaw7wXa -> I'm not sure which is the new one now sda1/sdc1
2012-07-27T23:38:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	How do I know where my /dev/loop0 comes from (using WUBI) - through /sda1 / sdc1
2012-07-27T23:39:00.000Z	OptimizedCoder	kyle__	how do I get that info?
