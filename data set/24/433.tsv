2011-10-19T18:42:00.000Z	supNow		does anyone know how to find the wine folder/programs in 11.10
2011-10-19T18:43:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	you mean it's not under ~/.wine like before?
2011-10-19T18:44:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	no the folder does not exist in home like it did before update
2011-10-19T18:44:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	and it isn't found in unity by program name
2011-10-19T18:44:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	ouch
2011-10-19T18:44:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	yes :(
2011-10-19T18:45:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	would it matter whether your 11.10 was a fresh install or an upgrade?
2011-10-19T18:45:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	after searching the net I find that I'm not the only one and a real fix hasn't been posted
2011-10-19T18:46:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	my upgrade to 11.04 it was fine, it wasn't until the 11.10 upgrade when it vanished
2011-10-19T18:46:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	for a new diagnostic data point, you might try making a fresh install on a separate disk partition
2011-10-19T18:46:00.000Z	adminewb		or partition(s)
2011-10-19T18:47:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	I'll pass on that for now it's busy season at work and I'm trying to convince the boss we should be using ubuntu... don't have time to reinstall everything
2011-10-19T18:48:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	thanks for the response though... maybe you can help with another issue
2011-10-19T18:48:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	may I didn't say it right; the idea being you leave the existing system intact while building a disposable 11.10 installation for testing purposes only
2011-10-19T18:48:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	my workspaces have turned black when activated... the wallpaper is removed after doing updates last night
2011-10-19T18:49:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	but it shows all the apps in each space
2011-10-19T18:49:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	but I see why you'd not want to experiment much on a production system
2011-10-19T18:49:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	yes it's just the production aspect... it's busy season and I don't have time to tinker in the office
2011-10-19T18:51:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	glad if I could help, what's the other issue?
2011-10-19T18:52:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	my workspaces lost the wallpaper and everything is black when activated after running updates last night. however the apps still show in all 4 spaces
2011-10-19T18:52:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	if you're talking unity, i'm really not familiar
2011-10-19T18:53:00.000Z	supNow	adminewb	ahh ok. well I'll go do some work and ask in here later, maybe someone else will know. thanks for taking the time though
2011-10-19T18:53:00.000Z	adminewb		on ubuntu I only ever use old fashioned gnome, 10.04.3 LTS
2011-10-19T18:53:00.000Z	adminewb	supNow	sure
