2011-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	ruan_	WINDOWS BOOT MANAGER - The selected file could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt: \NST\AutoNeoGrub0.mbr
2011-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	ruan_	SealedWithAKiss	mbr is corrupt?
2011-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	ruan_	that's what it says.
2011-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	ruan_	SealedWithAKiss	i dont get why windows boot manager complains about grub being corrupt

2011-03-01T14:49:00.000Z	ruan_	SealedWithAKiss	can't boot off a flash usb?
2011-03-01T14:50:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	ruan_	You need to use EasyBCD to create a bootable USB on another Windows machine. Then copy the contents of the ISO you downloaded from our ISO to the USB, and use EasyBCD to add a WinPE entry pointing to the .WIM file on the USB. Apparently.
2011-03-01T14:51:00.000Z	ruan_	SealedWithAKiss	the last step is confusing
2011-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	ruan_	good job I backed up for the first time in my life like 4 hours ago.
