2005-10-24T14:21:00.000Z	tidalwav1		TiMoDo: It didn't work. :)
2005-10-24T14:22:00.000Z	tidalwav1		STILL can't get my NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 to work, and I followed the wiki instructions...I keep getting an error about no usable screen.
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	you need the older drivers for that
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	I am using nvidia-glx-legacy
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	right
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	well, trying to.
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	but it still doesn't work.
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	did you do nvidia-glx-config enable? (or equivalent)
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	yes, I did.
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	and restarted X
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	yes.
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	it said could not insert nvidia.ko
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	except the file exsists.
2005-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	sudo modprobe nvidia
2005-10-24T14:25:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	FATAL: Error inserting nvidia (/lib/modules/2.6.12-9-686/volatile/nvidia.ko): No such device
2005-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	the driver doesn't think the card is there?
2005-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	apparently?
2005-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	is it because of the 686 kernel?
2005-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	I don't know how to help you. 686 should be ok
2005-10-24T14:27:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	okay, thanks, time to blare another message to the room
2005-10-24T14:27:00.000Z	tidalwav1		anyone have any idea why a RIVA TNT2 won't work with nvidia-glx-legacy?
2005-10-24T14:27:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	did you try nvidia-glx as well?
2005-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	tidalwav1	frank23	I did before, and it didn't work either.
2005-10-24T14:28:00.000Z	frank23	tidalwav1	o
