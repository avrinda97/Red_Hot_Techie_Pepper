2007-03-29T16:36:00.000Z	dromer		ok, I'm installing/configing mpd using this howto: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31763  but when I try the $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure mpd nothing happens
2007-03-29T16:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	I just installed from source?
2007-03-29T16:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	I think thats just for editting config right? gksudo gedit /etc/mpd.conf
2007-03-29T16:37:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	no, I installed using apt
2007-03-29T16:38:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	I have no idea what I need to change to make it work
2007-03-29T16:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Do you want me to give you my conf file?
2007-03-29T16:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Yeah. Basically just set up your music directory at the top and enable alsa
2007-03-29T16:42:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	oh ok
2007-03-29T16:42:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	the howto explains making symlinks in the music-folder
2007-03-29T16:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Yeah I tried that. I found it unnecessary though
2007-03-29T16:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Mine just points to "/media/Music" (my music directory)
2007-03-29T16:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Then symlinking would be the best way of going about it.
2007-03-29T16:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Create ~/music, then symlink all your other music directories into there, and point MPD to ~/music
2007-03-29T16:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Not ssh. MPD is just a server. You can run mpd on your ubuntu box and connect to it via a media player on windows
2007-03-29T16:47:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	can't I use mpc over ssh? I'm not sure, I thought it worked that way too
2007-03-29T16:48:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	no I want to access/listen my music over ssh
2007-03-29T16:48:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	I can x-forward though ;) but that doesn't forward sound
2007-03-29T16:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Why?
2007-03-29T16:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Just share your music files with samba.
2007-03-29T16:53:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	hmm, no I don't want that
2007-05-23T05:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Changed any bios settings lately?
2007-05-23T05:33:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	nope
2007-05-23T05:33:00.000Z	dromer	Stormx2	not that i know of
2007-05-23T05:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	dromer	Google it? ubuntuforums.org search?
