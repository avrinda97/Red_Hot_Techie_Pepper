2009-05-11T09:35:00.000Z	the1corrupted		m0rtimer: Well the kernel itself is perfectly fine and all the files seem to be in order (at least the diagnostics say so) but I still can't get the GUI up and running...  Is there a way I can reconstruct Linux on my system without total format?
2009-05-11T09:37:00.000Z	the1corrupted		Anyone?  I really don't feel like formatting my HDD AGAIN....
2009-05-11T09:37:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	does your system crash immediately after installing during first boot to new os?
2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	It crashes some time after it's already up and running.  I think it may have something to do with the graphics card.  Or the fact it's a 64-bit system.
2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	64bit shouldn't be the prob.. what graphics?
2009-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	ATI Radeon.
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	have you installed the restricted ati driver from restricted drivers manager? no probs there? you're on 9.04?
2009-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	I did via the hardware manager thing that came packaged with Ubuntu.
2009-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	9.04 yes?
2009-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	Yeah.  From what (all the exhaustive) diagnostics tell me is that there is nothing wrong with the Ubuntu installation...
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	Now before each crash, there is one thing in common: I'm trying to get my blasted touchpad working.
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	i can't be of more help, but i think it'd be good to start with graphics. maybe turn of restricted driver and see if you get same result? try running from livecd and see if that crashes. try turning off desktop effects before you try the other things.
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	oh, that's probly good info
2009-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	so touchpad doesn't work out of the box?
2009-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	No.  Now I've found ways of modifying xorg.conf but whenever I even touch the file, it's like pandora's box.
2009-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	i've always enjoyed how well touchpads work out of the box on ubuntu with all features working. maybe you should try google for your laptop model as well as ubuntuforums
2009-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	and divulge that info here for further possible help
2009-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	Tried that...  I open Xorg.conf via Gedit, don't change a thing, save it, and the next thing I know, my GUI fries.
2009-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	do an 'lspci' to see what ubuntu says your touchpad is, might help you track down info
2009-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	It says it's a "PS/2 Mouse"
2009-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	huh
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	laptop model?
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	cyd_away	the1corrupted	weird that you wouldn't see 'synaptics' or 'alps' touchpad device..
2009-05-11T09:46:00.000Z	the1corrupted	cyd_away	Toshiba Sattelite P305D
