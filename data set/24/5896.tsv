2006-04-10T13:48:00.000Z	arrick		I already have a ssh session open
2006-04-10T13:49:00.000Z	arrick		ok
2006-04-10T13:50:00.000Z	arrick		why did I get told to ssh in to edit my webpage on the apache server?
2006-04-10T13:50:00.000Z	sean	arrick	Because you can
2006-04-10T13:50:00.000Z	arrick	sean	how?
2006-04-10T13:50:00.000Z	sean	arrick	read man sftp
2006-04-10T13:51:00.000Z	sean	arrick	sftp is a programs that uses a ssh subsystem to transfer files similer to ftp
2006-04-10T13:52:00.000Z	sean	arrick	as long as the server has sftp-server, which I assume it does, you can do it from Konqueror is use use kubuntu
2006-04-10T13:52:00.000Z	sean	arrick	Otherwise, start sftp in a terminal with similar syntax to ssh
2006-04-10T13:53:00.000Z	arrick	sean	i have creating the page with frontpage on xp,
2006-04-10T13:53:00.000Z	sean	arrick	There are winxp programs too
2006-04-10T13:53:00.000Z	sean	arrick	Inclusing ones from sf.net if i remember correctly
2006-04-10T13:54:00.000Z	sean	arrick	No, it cannot be started in an already running session of ssh
2006-04-10T13:54:00.000Z	sean	arrick	But you can  reconnect with sftp instead.
2006-04-10T13:55:00.000Z	sean	arrick	Just do "sftp user@host.com" no quotes
2006-04-10T14:09:00.000Z	sean	arrick	I left for a moment
2006-04-10T14:10:00.000Z	sean	arrick	I cannot help you much there, I have not really used windows much in 3 years, I don't know
2006-04-10T14:10:00.000Z	sean	arrick	It's usually dragnDrop
2006-04-10T14:44:00.000Z	arrick	sean	have you ever set up an ftp on an ubuntu/apache server?
