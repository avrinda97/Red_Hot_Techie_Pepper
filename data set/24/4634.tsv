2007-02-23T12:47:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		hey guys big noob here anyone can help me with wireless setings?
2007-02-23T12:47:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		cant get my card to run on ubuntu?
2007-02-23T12:48:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	what card? in a lappy or desktop?
2007-02-23T12:48:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		desktop a dwl-g520 with atheros chipset
2007-02-23T12:49:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		during the instalation the card is recognised and im prompted to enter wep and other information
2007-02-23T12:49:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		but after the install the card isnt there anymore -_-
2007-02-23T12:50:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	do a google for "atheros wireless ubuntu" . I googled for my wireless on my lappy (broadcom in a presario) and i found the howto in just a few minutes...
2007-02-23T12:50:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		i will try for the 100th time lol
2007-02-23T12:51:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	lol...ok l'll give it a go... do u have network manager installed?
2007-02-23T12:52:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		no, got ubuntu server
2007-02-23T12:52:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	ok. u said the card disapeared?
2007-02-23T12:53:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		really strange iwconfig doesnt list the card, even tho it was there at install
2007-02-23T12:53:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		yeah
2007-02-23T12:54:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	u using ndiswrapper?
2007-02-23T12:54:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		i dont know, just the fresh install from the server version of ubuntu
2007-02-23T12:56:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		1: lo:...
2007-02-23T12:56:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	I'm no expert, but i would try using ndiswrapper and the windows driver, unless your googleing has pointed you to an open sourced driver, that works.
2007-02-23T12:57:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		as far as iv read its supposed to work of the bat
2007-02-23T12:57:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		but ppl usually have problem if the have wep enabeled
2007-02-23T12:57:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		as i do
2007-02-23T12:57:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_		tho they all seem to have diff solutions (which dont work for me) and some just dont work
2007-02-23T12:58:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	then I'll stop trying to help. mine was a major PITA. Yours sounds too easy...
2007-02-23T12:58:00.000Z	_84Z00K4_	bulmer	yes
2007-02-23T12:58:00.000Z	LordKeiden	_84Z00K4_	I even read that mine didnt work at all in any flavor...
