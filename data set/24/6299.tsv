2006-12-17T14:54:00.000Z	RichB		I've got an Ubuntu Edgy box one which the gnome menus at the top and bottom are not responding (although strangely the icons in the "tray" at the top right are responding). Is there any sort of keystroke that will bring up something that allows me to kill the non-responding panel app? In windows I'd either use ctrl-alt-del to bring up taskman or use ctrl-esc to do the same. What is the equivalent on Ubuntu? I guess I'd prefer not to do ctrl-del or ctrl-
2006-12-17T14:56:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	you can restart the gnome panel with "killall gnome-panel"
2006-12-17T14:56:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	How do I issue the command killall ? That's my problem you see
2006-12-17T14:57:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	if you cant get a terminal, you could go to ctrl+alt+f1, login and type that (ctrl+alt+f7 gets you back in x windows)
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	So how do I get to a terminal if gnome-panel isn't working?
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	maybe with alt+f2 (or what i said earlier)
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	Is there any GUI way of doing that
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	It's my wife's computer and she's not really used to doing command line stuff
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	you can start gnome-terminal with alt+f2 ?
2006-12-17T15:00:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	well, you could allso try alt+f2, type xkill and then select the gnome panel with the skull...
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	Tried alt-F2 but nothing happens. I guess whatever was watching for that has hung
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	ah ok, then your best bet is virtual terminal, ctrl+alt+f1
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	Cheers. It's not ideal. Hopefully there'll be something much better in Fiesty
2006-12-17T15:02:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	and that would be ?
2006-12-17T15:08:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	The ideal UI would be something more like Windows that doesn't require a command line to fix things when the shell dies/hangs.
2006-12-17T15:09:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	what ? i thought the gui freezed... as alt+f2 didnt work anymore...
2006-12-17T15:09:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	Correct. alt-f2 didn't work.
2006-12-17T15:10:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	so, if in ms-windows the gui freezed (ctrl+alt+del) doesnt work, you can only restart... on ubuntu you can go to ctrl+alt+f1 and do something for the console... so, cli rules over gui ;)
2006-12-17T15:11:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	ctrl-alt-del always works. It is a hotkey that is not managed by the shell
2006-12-17T15:11:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	what ever you say...
2006-12-17T15:12:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	and as long computers are programmed with _text_, text based "rescue" will win!
2006-12-17T15:14:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	user friendly is very relative... and i find it very userfirendly to say on irc type this and that command, rather than clieck there scroll there and heres a screenshot...
2006-12-17T15:15:00.000Z	RichB	oskude	User friendly is relative. And Windows is still more user friendly than Ubuntu. Even sabdfl has said so
2006-12-17T15:19:00.000Z	oskude	RichB	btw, have you looked at system monitor panel applet ? im sure theres a way to open that on ctrl+alt+del...
