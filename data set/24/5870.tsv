2006-06-15T09:54:00.000Z	Some_Person		Is anyone here familiar with GNOME PPP?
2006-06-15T09:55:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	i've used it...wouldn't say familiar
2006-06-15T09:55:00.000Z	Some_Person		I'm trying to use it, but it hangs on "Sending Password"
2006-06-15T09:55:00.000Z	Some_Person		I can, however, connect by typing "wvdial" in terminal
2006-06-15T09:56:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	installed it via repos?
2006-06-15T09:56:00.000Z	Some_Person	orbin	yep
2006-06-15T09:57:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	sure it hangs?  maybe it's just authenticating
2006-06-15T09:57:00.000Z	Some_Person	orbin	but i didn't install wvdial thru repos (i used dpkg and a deb file because i had no internet in ubuntu)
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	Some_Person		i let it go for an hour
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	wvdial's actually on the install cd.
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	Some_Person		i didnt know that
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	heh, that's long enough...try running it in terminal to see for errors
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	Some_Person		running gnome-ppp?
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	orbin		yep
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	Some_Person		ok
2006-06-15T09:58:00.000Z	Some_Person		i'll have to disconnet first
2006-06-15T10:04:00.000Z	orbin		stupid question: it's just a frontend to iptables right?  does that mean we're no less protected w/ it closed than w/ it open?
2006-06-15T10:04:00.000Z	Some_Person		There were no errors
2006-06-15T10:05:00.000Z	Some_Person		I did see my password pop up in the terminal
2006-06-15T10:05:00.000Z	Some_Person		it was on a line
2006-06-15T10:05:00.000Z	Some_Person		i tried pressing enter in the terminal to enter that line
2006-06-15T10:05:00.000Z	Some_Person		but that also failed
2006-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	Some_Person		any ideas?
2006-06-15T10:07:00.000Z	orbin	Some_Person	not reall, sorry.
