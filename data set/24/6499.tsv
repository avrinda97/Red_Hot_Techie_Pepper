2005-12-11T06:32:00.000Z	victor		before it worked properly..
2005-12-11T06:33:00.000Z	victor		i don't think that will work, i've trying as well doing a halt, or killing X and shutting down from terminal
2005-12-11T06:33:00.000Z	victor		that's strange as well, it reboots perfectly, but it doesn't halt
2005-12-11T06:35:00.000Z	victor		yes, i can halt it by pressing the button, and it reboots without checking anything
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		sorry? i don't understand that
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		linux can't shut down the pc
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		i can manually
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		windows also can
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		and linux was able to some days ago
2005-12-11T06:38:00.000Z	victor		by manually i mean using the power button lol
2005-12-11T06:38:00.000Z	soundray	victor	I have a workaround for problems with shutting down, using grub.
2005-12-11T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	victor	add a stanza to /boot/grub/menu.lst with 'title Shutdown' and 'halt'
2005-12-11T06:40:00.000Z	soundray	victor	then you can shutdown with 'yes | grub-reboot 5' (replace 5 with the appropriate number for your shutdown stanza).
2005-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	victor	soundray	but your workaround is like typing halt in command-line?
2005-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	soundray	victor	yes, roughly.
2005-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	soundray	victor	what doesn't work?
2005-12-11T06:46:00.000Z	soundray	victor	put it up on http://pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-12-11T06:47:00.000Z	victor	soundray	i use klipper
2005-12-11T06:47:00.000Z	soundray	victor	in Gnome?
2005-12-11T06:48:00.000Z	soundray	victor	mjr, it does paste things, but only if you've selected them in Ooo itself...
2005-12-11T06:50:00.000Z	victor	soundray	what are you talking about?
2005-12-11T06:54:00.000Z	soundray	victor	do you want to copy your /var/log/messages to pastebin?
2005-12-11T06:57:00.000Z	victor	soundray	yes, frogzo1 asked me about my /var/log/messages
2005-12-11T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	victor	apt-get install lunch :)
