2008-04-14T11:02:00.000Z	evilbug		Bidget- are you ubuntu-only?
2008-04-14T11:02:00.000Z	evilbug		Bidget- don't remember,haven't had to mess with it in months.let me see if i can figure that out.
2008-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	evilbug		go to Server List
2008-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	evilbug		File>Server List that's what it is for me.
2008-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	evilbug		i'm in osx btw...
2008-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	i'm so sorry.
2008-04-14T11:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	did you lose a bet?
2008-04-14T11:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	VirtualBox is so easy, plus seamless integration is great
2008-04-14T11:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	no, definitely not. I hate iTunes, even if it would run smoothly in windows.
2008-04-14T11:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	It's more like Windows Media Player 10
2008-04-14T11:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	iTunes has that 4 panel layout of artist, album, song and playlist
2008-04-14T11:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	I only liked it for the treeview, it's terrible for actual playback
2008-04-14T11:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	but for managing, it's good
2008-04-14T11:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	try foobar, with a decent skin it's amazing
2008-04-14T11:39:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	and not just because of eyecandy, skins make up functionality
2008-04-14T11:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	agreed, and it's why i steered clear at first, but then i found a skin that had some good panels in it and so i just tried it out, and loved it
2008-04-14T11:41:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	but back to the topic
2008-04-15T03:51:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	no clue, seems i don't have permission to write a file to my own desktop haha
2008-04-15T03:52:00.000Z	dmsuperman	evilbug	haha
