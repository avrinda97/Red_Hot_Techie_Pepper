2008-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	Abyssal		hi is there a tool like eraser in windows that ensures in ubuntu that my data is erased safely?
2008-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	erase I think
2008-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	my mistake, its shred
2008-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	is it in the repository?
2008-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	yeah, should be pre-installed if I'm not mistaken
2008-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	and it can also delete with gutmann, us method etc.?
2008-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	shred is not in the repository.
2008-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	well, type man shred and see if it's installed
2008-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	yeah, you can specify number of iterations I think
2008-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	though a Gutmann pass is a bit silly today :P
2008-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	oh sorry. it is a shell command?
2008-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	i thought a window application
2008-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	yes
2008-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	there probably are other tools, but that's the one I have off the top of my head
2008-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	ok thanks. how to get out of that manual?
2008-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	ok thanks. 1. how to get out of that manual? 2. and why is gutmann silly?
2008-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	q
2008-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	and Gutmann's 35 passes were intended for a magnetic recording technology not used in today's hard drives
2008-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	a few DoD passes are more than enough to wipe data, but I guess if you want to do 35, go ahead
2008-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	will those harddrives be used in the future? or what was it developed for?
2008-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	Gutmann's paper was for the hard drives of the day
2008-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	the recording technology is simply not used today
2008-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	scguy318	Abyssal	you'll have to read it, I'm just remember from recall
2008-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	Abyssal	scguy318	ok thats enough information. but nice to know.
