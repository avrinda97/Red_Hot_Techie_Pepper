2010-12-28T05:05:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	use the chroot feature in whichever ftp server you are using
2010-12-28T05:06:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	yea, otherwise it would be easy =)
2010-12-28T05:07:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	you should still be able to do it though, I haven't had to chroot an SFTP user for a long long time though
2010-12-28T05:07:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	there is a lot of documentation but none of them have worked for me
2010-12-28T05:08:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	you could use scponly, but it won't work for existing users
2010-12-28T05:09:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	that was the last attempt that i tried
2010-12-28T05:09:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	that one should work fine, was what I used last time and it did the job nicely
2010-12-28T05:11:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	does that mean i cant configure scponly through ssh?
2010-12-28T05:12:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	no you should be able to configure it through ssh, just so long as you're not trying to create the same user you're currently logged in as
2010-12-28T05:12:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	ok cool, i dont want to limit my admin user :D
2010-12-28T05:16:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	scponly still requires openssh right?
2010-12-28T05:16:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	yeah, anything using SSH still needs openssh or similar
2010-12-28T05:16:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	ok no problem
2010-12-28T05:21:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	what about this method http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=229
2010-12-28T05:25:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	sorry for delay, that looks good, lots of work though for each user :(
2010-12-28T05:25:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	luckily i only have 2 users :D
2010-12-28T05:25:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	but it doesn't need to be for each user......just add each new users to sftp group
2010-12-28T05:42:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	dropbox as in an account with a 2gb limit to access files from any where including a phone
2010-12-28T05:44:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	haha subnet is simple :D
2010-12-28T05:44:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	I know, was just over-exagerating to make a point lol
2010-12-28T05:45:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	I used to be a guru of all things IT, but since I moved into development, I barely do anything systems or network related and am starting to forget in my old age :D
2010-12-28T05:46:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	i manage nodal networks for the army, i hope to get a cisco job when i get out
2010-12-28T05:50:00.000Z	MrUnagi	HollowPoint	"adduser -d /pub -s /usr/local/sbin/scponlyc scpdemo" i do not have scponlyc in that dir
2010-12-28T05:51:00.000Z	HollowPoint	MrUnagi	with scponly you should be using the setup_chroot.sh script, not adduser
