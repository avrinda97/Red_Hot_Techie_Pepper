2008-09-17T06:45:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit		hey all, trying to connect to my VNC setup on my ubuntu machine at home, but it won't let me in... I've tried TightVNC, and RealVNC, both mention something about security types... anybody know of a vnc program that works for connecting to ubuntu's supplied vnc server?
2008-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	any reason you cant use ssh x forwarding?
2008-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	it's behind a firewall and I don't have access to it at the moment, though I could do that
2008-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	there is a piece of software for windows called xMing, i was using it on XP to have remote x forwarding from windows to a gnome desktop
2008-09-17T06:47:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	and that would go over the internet, not just on a LAN?
2008-09-17T06:47:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	so i could use putty, setup x forwarding and loginto my ubuntu machine, then i could run anything that would normally require a x server, which xMing handles since it is an x server for windows
2008-09-17T06:48:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	it's connection abilities are using ssh... so anything you can setup ssh to connect to
2008-09-17T06:48:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	it was the easiest way for me to get gedit running on windows
2008-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	this was when i was using dapper though
2008-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	ah, i get you now, ssh into the box, forward the X11 ports
2008-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	ja
2008-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	cool, I'll try it when i get home
2008-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	better peformance than vnc
2008-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	would xMing support xdm?
2008-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	but im not sure about sessions...you could incorporate the use of 'screen' in there somehwere
2008-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	i dont know what xdm is
2008-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	is it like gdm?
2008-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	it is a blanket term for gdm and kdm for gnome and kde
2008-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	the act of logging in via ssh does the same thing that you would do via gdm/kdm/xdm
2008-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	once you are at the remote servers prompt, you just run stuff like : # gedit or # nautilus --no-desktop
2008-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	or you could just open up the nautilus desktop .... #nautilus
2008-09-17T06:53:00.000Z	Aaron_Mibbit	airtonix	a google search revealed that xMing does support XDMCP out of the box
2008-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	its one of my favourit pieces of software on windows
2008-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	airtonix	Aaron_Mibbit	providing you are stuck in a windows enviroment and are allowed to install xming
