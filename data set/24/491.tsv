2011-07-29T23:15:00.000Z	natty-user		Hi, may I ask the difference between Kubuntu, Ubuntu and Xubuntu?
2011-07-29T23:16:00.000Z	natty-user		All I know is Kubuntu uses KDE, Ubuntu uses GNOME, and Xubuntu uses Xfce.
2011-07-29T23:17:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	in short: the base system will be exactly the same... so you will have the same software... it will jsut look different
2011-07-29T23:18:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	xubunut uses xfce, the samllest and fastest of those you are mentioning. kde is know for being very complete and having a lot of settings you can change. gnome is generally know for being minimal and less  bulky tha KDE.
2011-07-29T23:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	they are a bit more than that...
2011-07-29T23:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	the menus will be organized in a different way
2011-07-29T23:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	but you can test it... all the interfaces are just programms, like any other progrma to
2011-07-29T23:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	you can easily install and uninstall them
2011-07-29T23:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	so you can turn a ubuntu in a full xubuntu or kubuntu and vice versa
2011-07-29T23:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	xfce is faster
2011-07-29T23:21:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	i use fluxbox.. it is one of the fastest... but very minimal
2011-07-29T23:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	fluxbox is not really for beginners... it makes a lot use of key short cuts
2011-07-29T23:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	i barely use the mouse
2011-07-29T23:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	maybe, if you are coming from gnome, xfce will be a good thing for you
2011-07-29T23:23:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	wait...do you ahve ubuntu installed?
2011-07-29T23:24:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	you can use gnome and xfce side by side and choose waht you like to use during log in
2011-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	natty-user	Benkinooby	Thanks
2011-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	you are welcome...
2011-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	again, all things can be installed side by side... you can have fluxbox, xfce, gnome, kde installed in the same time and then choose what to use when you log in
2011-07-29T23:29:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	i did that when i was looking for my favourite interface...
2011-07-29T23:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	btw, if you are playing around... i REALLY, recommend you to have a look at gnome-do or kupfer
2011-07-29T23:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	they are application starters and also index some of your most used files... gnome-do or kupfer make the use of menus obsolete and you will find your files very fast
2011-07-29T23:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	natty-user	there are youtube videos on how they work and what they can do
2011-07-29T23:31:00.000Z	natty-user	Benkinooby	I'll look into those too, its good to learn more about linux. I've learnt much today. Thanks again. I'll be back after re-logging in :)
