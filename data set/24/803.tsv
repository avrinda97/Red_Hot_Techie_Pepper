2011-01-12T05:12:00.000Z	wasser		hi people i installed ubuntu 10.10 and when i use apt-get install XXXXXX, my terminal doesnt autocomplete XXXXX with applications by pressing tab. any ideas?
2011-01-12T05:13:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	are you using konsole and kubuntu by chance?
2011-01-12T05:13:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	no, im using the terminal
2011-01-12T05:15:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	is it working in say xterm or a tty?
2011-01-12T05:16:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	i have just logged into tty1 and tried it and works just fine (my ubuntu installation is relatively fresh. Installed yesterday)
2011-01-12T05:18:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	log in as another user and try terminal then
2011-01-12T05:19:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	just did it. works fine in other account
2011-01-12T05:20:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	well then delete the config files of terminal and try again
2011-01-12T05:21:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	you mean bashrc?
2011-01-12T05:21:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	no
2011-01-12T05:24:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	i think everything is in ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal
2011-01-12T05:25:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	so rm -r  ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal  should do the trick
2011-01-12T05:26:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	do i have to logout then login again?
2011-01-12T05:26:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	possible. don't know. gconf is quirky
2011-01-12T05:26:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	doesn't hurt anyway
2011-01-12T05:27:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	hmmm... right now my autocomplete doesn't work at all when using sudo in front of things
2011-01-12T05:27:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	so not even in a tty?
2011-01-12T05:28:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	im going to logout from gnome and try again, cause in a tty it works...
2011-01-12T05:30:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	ok. situation right now: i logged out, logged in again and my autocomplete doesn't work at all with sudo stuff and apt-get doesn't autocomplete programs
2011-01-12T05:31:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	don't know an easy way then. delete all the configs and start over again :-)
2011-01-12T05:32:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	ok gonna try . thanks anyway ;)
2011-01-12T05:40:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	I solved my problem from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=734023 (just for you to get closure) purge bash_completion, reinstall, add code to .bashrc
2011-01-12T05:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	wasser	never considered that because you said it worked on a tty
2011-01-12T05:41:00.000Z	wasser	sam-_-	because it works, maybe the lines in bashrc changed something?
