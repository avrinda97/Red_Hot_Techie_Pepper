2005-04-26T05:20:00.000Z	declan		Greetings from Dublin. I've looked through a lot of posts here and there, about getting my dvd playback working, but I'm not getting anywhere.  The problem is that as soon as I put the dvd in the drive, the system mounts it as a CD-Rom.  I've tried doing symbolic links and all that, but to no avail.  Anybody want to try and help?
2005-04-26T05:21:00.000Z	declan		The error xine gives is "the source can't be read."
2005-04-26T05:21:00.000Z	revelater	declan	you need libdvdcss
2005-04-26T05:25:00.000Z	revelater	declan	no not really, just plain xine if you can, or totem - xine
2005-04-26T05:29:00.000Z	revelater	declan	that is both strange and dangerouse
2005-04-26T05:30:00.000Z	revelater	declan	ahh, but i cannot forsake my love of expresso
2005-04-26T05:31:00.000Z	revelater	declan	sorry
2005-04-26T05:31:00.000Z	revelater	declan	i am trying though

2005-04-26T05:33:00.000Z	revelater	declan	and i will, trust me, and at un down i will play my pipes also
2005-04-26T05:36:00.000Z	revelater	declan	whatever it started with is what would be best, it no doubt has already detected your dvd player
2005-04-26T05:37:00.000Z	revelater	declan	try setting it to /cdrom
2005-04-26T05:38:00.000Z	revelater	declan	do you only have one cd/dvd drive or do you have two?
2005-04-26T05:39:00.000Z	revelater	declan	i suggest that, unless you are having bugs or problems, that you not upgrade...
2005-04-26T05:41:00.000Z	revelater	declan	i have all of those also and mine works
2005-04-26T05:41:00.000Z	revelater	declan	so you have reinstalled libdvdcss2?
2005-04-26T05:41:00.000Z	revelater	declan	and totem - xine?
2005-04-26T05:42:00.000Z	revelater	declan	ok try that
2005-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	revelater	declan	so do you have just regular xine installed?
2005-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	revelater	declan	if so, then try installing totem - gstreamer
2005-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	declan	revelater	I uninstalled libdvdcss2.  But now I have to go looking to reactivate the relevant repository.
2005-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	revelater	declan	it shouldn't be much harder than just installing it again
2005-04-26T05:50:00.000Z	revelater	declan	taht could have been the problem there, synaptic needs all the sources of all the programs it has in order to build and upgrade dependancies
2005-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	revelater	declan	yup, well i am clear out of ideas... i am kind of new to linux so....
