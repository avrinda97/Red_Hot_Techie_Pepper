2005-08-13T08:49:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	i find apps easier to install in linux by far
2005-08-13T09:16:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	what part is giving you trouble?
2005-08-13T09:17:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	hold on
2005-08-13T09:18:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	Go to java.sun.com and download the j2sdk or j2re .bin file for Linux. Not the rpm! Install 'java-package' and 'fakeroot' via Synaptic. Now run 'fakeroot make-jpkg <name of the java file you downloaded>'. This will generate a .deb. Install that file using dpkg. Done!
2005-08-13T09:18:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	I followed that exactly and it didn't work
2005-08-13T09:19:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	let me check on it one sec
2005-08-13T09:20:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	where did those instructions come from? do you have a link?
2005-08-13T09:21:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	that was referred to me by someone through ubotu.
2005-08-13T09:22:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	why not use apt-get to install java?
2005-08-13T09:22:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	i got errors with that too
2005-08-13T09:23:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	im not sure what to tell you
2005-08-13T09:24:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	is this the command u used and got errors?  sudo apt-get install sun-j2re1.5
2005-08-13T09:25:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	my issue is why all of these DOS-like commands? Is there a distro that will eliminate majority of these?
2005-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	I was told to use that command without the sudo bit.
2005-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	umm there are a couple of distros that claim to be more "friendly like windows" but i havent tried them
2005-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	use sudo and see what happens
2005-08-13T09:27:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	UBUNTU was reccommended by the biggest Microsoft apologists: ZDNET!
2005-08-13T09:28:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	Ubuntu is very easy compared to some others
2005-08-13T09:29:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	I realized that, UBUNTU installed on my thinkpad in thirty minutes, I was very imperssed!
2005-08-13T09:29:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	did that command work?
2005-08-13T09:32:00.000Z	adman_	youngcoder	this is wht i get>>>root@ubu:/home/adman # sudo apt-get install sun-j2rel.5
2005-08-13T09:32:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	one sec
2005-08-13T09:36:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	did you ever add extra repositories
2005-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	youngcoder	adman_	http://ubuntuguide.org/..... it will have a section on adding extra repositories then that command should work
