2009-10-09T05:08:00.000Z	kilo		Hey all!  really Really new to Ubuntu (9.04) here... I was trying to perma-mount a network drive using cifs and I've modified fstab and all, but when I reboot, nothing pops up on the desktop. If I pop a "sudo mount -a" everytime I logon, it pops up just fine... any ideas?
2009-10-09T05:08:00.000Z	kilo		hehe
2009-10-09T05:10:00.000Z	kilo		Anyone have any idea about network mounts? I'm stumped   :P
2009-10-09T05:10:00.000Z	kilo		samba
2009-10-09T05:11:00.000Z	kilo		lol, I just did what the pretty online tutorials showed me in the pictures
2009-10-09T05:12:00.000Z	kilo		So NFS can perma mount a drive on a windows network to a jaunty box
2009-10-09T05:12:00.000Z	kilo		?
2009-10-09T05:12:00.000Z	kilo		LOL
2009-10-09T05:13:00.000Z	kilo		I'm not stuck using samba
2009-10-09T05:13:00.000Z	kilo		this is a totally new build
2009-10-09T05:13:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	You can use Webmin to configure samba
2009-10-09T05:19:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Wait, if the problem is mounting network volume, you can put the command to mount your NFS volume in the file /etc/rc.local
2009-10-09T05:21:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Well, if you only have linux client than NFS can be good, and it is easy to administrate
2009-10-09T05:59:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Well, when you stick to Samba, do you have problems mounting network volumes from Windows or Mac ?
2009-10-09T06:00:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	From your Ubuntu box ?
2009-10-09T06:01:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Can you explain the situation to me, I didn't get everything out of it.  I remember setting a Samba server with auto-mounting from another linux box
2009-10-09T06:03:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Does these shared folder have restrictions applied to them ?
2009-10-09T06:04:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Ah wait, I know what you want !
2009-10-09T06:04:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Basically, instead of putting them into the fstab file, put them into the rc.local folder under /etc
2009-10-09T06:05:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	This rc.local file runs command after everything is up bascially
2009-10-09T06:06:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Theorically, it should work.  All you have to do is type the command you want to run in that file, so if you have 4 share you will type four times the mount -t smbfs command
2009-10-09T06:06:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	This file is run as root anyway :P
2009-10-09T06:08:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Well, I would do it like this, or does a mount -a right now mount the two other network drives ?
2009-10-09T06:09:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	kilo	Ok so you can leave what you need in fstab and just put mount -a in rc.local.  That would solve your problem of network drives not mapping properly
