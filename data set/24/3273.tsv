2008-11-02T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/810features/
2008-11-02T18:15:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	i meant from 8.04.
2008-11-02T18:15:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	right, what did I send you?
2008-11-02T18:16:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	An overall about the features in ubuntu (not 8.10 specificly=
2008-11-02T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	it is about 8.10
2008-11-02T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	basically, if 8.04 works for you and you don't care for newer software, then there is no reason to upgrade
2008-11-02T18:17:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	I do care about new software, problem is, my old nvidia card is not longer supported in 8.10 (only beta drivers where compiz messes openoffice)
2008-11-02T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	then I would wait if I were you
2008-11-02T18:18:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	What are the biggest changes from 8.04 to 8.10 ? I just want a list of noticeable features. (Already noticed quite faster)
2008-11-02T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/810rc#New%20Features%20since%20Ubuntu%208.04 that might be what you are looking for
2008-11-08T04:42:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	or by "there" do you mean "synaptic"?
2008-11-08T04:42:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	I know that, but it is hidden from the synaptic, that is my problem, I know how to install manually
2008-11-08T04:42:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	yes
2008-11-08T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	check your filters for search maybe
2008-11-08T04:43:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	Everything set to all
2008-11-08T04:44:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	also problem with other stuff such as nvidia-glx-96
2008-11-08T04:44:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	A lot seems to be missing in manager since reinstall
2008-11-08T04:45:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	I've seen someone else have the same problem.  I don't know though since I can't duplicate it here.  Tried hitting reload? Does it say "rebuilding index"?
2008-11-08T04:45:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	Yes it does.
2008-11-08T04:45:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	I'd try giving it some time to let it finish then
2008-11-08T04:46:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	I did
2008-11-08T04:46:00.000Z	amews_aj	jrib	Strange, I already did that 5 times or so, now I did it again, now they show up.
2009-01-10T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	amews_aj	why?
