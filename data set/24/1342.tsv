2010-02-27T16:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 what software?
2010-02-27T16:22:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	Oracle web tier utilities
2010-02-27T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 so its a binary installer? or source? or what?
2010-02-27T16:23:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	the install script is a bash script
2010-02-27T16:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	  check the script out and the progrema homepage/forums there maybe some option you need to use.
2010-02-27T16:24:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	the installer uses Java to execute the installation
2010-02-27T16:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 so basically its installing premade binaries some where.
2010-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	That is correct
2010-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	I specify the directory and it creates the directory and then begins the installation
2010-02-27T16:27:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	I guess I could create the directory ahead of time, but I would like to be able to specify the directory and then the installation create the directories
2010-02-27T16:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 seems loke an odd bug if it cant write to its own dirrectories its made.
2010-02-27T16:31:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	The installation states that I don't have permissions to create the directory
2010-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	How do I set the user to have directory creation permissions?
2010-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 seems weird, You could run th installer with sudo I guess.. but that sounds like a nasty way to do it
2010-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 if its in their home dir. they allready do.
2010-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 any system dirs.. they do not
2010-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	it is not in the home directory. Can I change so it has permissions to create outside of its home directory
2010-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 then you run the installer as root.
2010-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	the installer does not allow the installation to be done with root
2010-02-27T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 i would say check their install docs then. I think there maybe somthing you missed.
2010-02-27T16:34:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	I guess I will have to create under the home directory
2010-02-27T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spokes	 if its makng a system directoy like /var/www/XXX then thats not going to be makeable by the user. Unless you run it as a user with proper group permissions for /var/www/
2010-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	I did the install under the home directory. It wasn't worth the hassle to do it any other way
2010-02-27T16:37:00.000Z	spokes	Dr_Willis	Thanks for the information
