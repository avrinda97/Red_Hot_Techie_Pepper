2008-08-27T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	There is no seen command, What are you looking for?
2008-08-27T20:58:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	he was assisting me with something a few days ago.
2008-08-27T20:59:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	!seen causeitsme did resolve something
2008-08-27T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	It hasn't done anything the last three times you've done it.
2008-08-27T20:59:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	it gave me: -Kyrin- causeitsme quit IRC stating 'Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)' 4d 18h 22m 9s ago.
2008-08-27T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	Stop.
2008-08-27T21:00:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	now it gave me: -kitche- Pici is here in #ubuntu
2008-08-27T21:02:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	The only automated scripts allowed in this channel are those from ubottu. I've removed that user, now please stop it with the !seen stuff.

2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	kyrin
2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	I was not trying to be annoying.
2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	who is kyrin?
2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	The one that was responding to your !seen commands
2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	and why does it resolve when you use the "!seen command"
2008-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	stat_cs	Pici	that was not the only one
2008-08-27T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	stat_cs	nevermind, this is offtopic.
