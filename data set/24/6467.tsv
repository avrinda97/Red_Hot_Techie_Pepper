2005-10-13T06:39:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	What do you mean by "cannot load it" ?
2005-10-13T06:46:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	I might be able to help you, what is your problem exactly ?
2005-10-13T06:47:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	hyperactivecrond seems to know the trick as well :) Your problem is you can't choose Linux/Windows at boot ?
2005-10-13T06:47:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Yes ?
2005-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Remove the partition ? Which partition ? Why did you remove it ?
2005-10-13T06:51:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	How did you erase it ?
2005-10-13T06:52:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Yes, but from where ? From a linux program ? From Windows ? DId you want to install any Linux distro on the same partition, for instance ?
2005-10-13T06:52:00.000Z	MTommy	lllmanulll	i format the linux partition from windows
2005-10-13T06:52:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Okay, so now you want to install Linux again ? Or you just want to use Windows ?
2005-10-13T06:53:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Hmm, I see
2005-10-13T06:54:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	Well, everything would be like before if you reinstalled Windows, but I'm not sure you're ready to do that...
2005-10-13T06:55:00.000Z	MTommy	lllmanulll	the problem it's that Grub is still installed on my pc, and it's not working because somthing is missing
2005-10-13T06:55:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	topyli is right, and you need to run that from the Windows shell ("DOS like")
2005-10-13T07:10:00.000Z	lllmanulll	MTommy	It seems you rather need a Windows expert :)
