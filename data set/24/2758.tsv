2009-05-02T03:07:00.000Z	Joeseph	MarkJones	It is.  Maybe I'm having a video driver issue?

2009-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	Joeseph	MarkJones	I can see my unencrypted dvds in vlc, but it's small, fuzzy, with lines through it and the image repeating.
2009-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	MarkJones	Joeseph	Try installing a vid driver then.You got a ATI or NVIDIA?

2009-05-02T03:13:00.000Z	MarkJones	Joeseph	install sysinfo
2009-05-02T03:14:00.000Z	Joeseph	MarkJones	ATI Tehc. Inc. Radeon Mobility M6 LY
