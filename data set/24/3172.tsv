2008-04-12T21:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	you can PM ubotu triggers rather than just running them over and over and flooding the chanel.
2008-04-12T21:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	then use their name and highlight it to them and they won't over look it.
2008-04-12T21:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	true, but if i need your opinion on that, i'll ask.
2008-04-12T21:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	i don't care if you're helping, you're just flooding the channel with stupid bot factoids when you can just pm them.
2008-04-12T21:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	then you had an amazing install.
2008-04-12T21:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	it will be removed when you are
2008-06-20T06:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	what video card?

2008-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	do you have nvidia-settings installed?
2008-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	I do
2008-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	run nvidia-settings, and you can set refresh rates, etc, in there, then save them
2008-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	Ah. Thanks.
2008-06-20T06:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	unfortunately i'm not at my PC, on my laptop and it doesn't have nvidia, but I'm amlost positive its there.. isn't it where you set the resolutions?
2008-06-20T06:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	sorry, i can't remember off hand, but i could have swore it was there
2008-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	what does fdisk -l do?
2008-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	lists your partitions
2008-06-20T07:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	well yeah, but how does that make gparted see the drive?
2008-06-20T07:34:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	regardless of mounting or not...I just remember that gparted used some wierd detection scheme that fdisk didn't...and fisk saw it
2008-06-20T07:34:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	the bug's already been reported
2008-06-20T07:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dmsuperman	any idea on the bug #?
2008-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	dcoblent: Ultimately what I did was add some unallocated space between each of my partitions and it worked...it was a problem with "overlapping" partitions (or so it thought)
2008-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	dmsuperman	IndyGunFreak	and no, I don't. I think it's one of the few bugs I commented on, if it's possible to search by posts by user my user is dmsuperman
