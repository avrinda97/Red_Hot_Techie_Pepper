2009-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	twig11		From the Desktop CD installer for Jaunty, what do I need to do to reinstall the operating system without affecting /dev/sda6 where I have my home folder?
2009-07-22T08:18:00.000Z	twig11		From the Desktop CD installer for Jaunty, what do I need to do to reinstall the operating system without affecting /dev/sda6 where I have my home folder? I'm at the "Prepare Partitions" screen now, so would really appreciate some quick help.
2009-07-22T08:19:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	what are you trying to do?
2009-07-22T08:20:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I'm trying to reinstall Jaunty without having to re-import all my files. I have /home on its own partition, so that should be simple, right?
2009-07-22T08:20:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	sorry, without having to re-import all my personal files
2009-07-22T08:20:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	you can backup your /home directory somewhere
2009-07-22T08:21:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I don't have to do that if /home is on its own partition, do I?
2009-07-22T08:21:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	reinstall the system and backup the /home directory
2009-07-22T08:24:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	can you post fdisk -l ?
2009-07-22T08:24:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I can see the three partitions I made when I originally installed the system: /dev/sda1, /dev/sda5 (swap), and /dev/sda6 (where /home is). What I want to know is how to install the operating system without formatting /dev/sda6.
2009-07-22T08:25:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I don't know how to run a command from where I am right now on an install screen.
2009-07-22T08:26:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	from Application>Accessories>Terminal
2009-07-22T08:26:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	sudo fdisk -l
2009-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	you can delete the /dev/sda6 partition
2009-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I don't really want to stop in the middle of the installation. Did you read what I posted before? I'm booted into the desktop cd, at the Prepare Partitions screen in the graphical installer. I would have to reboot to do something on my desktop and I don't even know if that's safe.
2009-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	That would delete my home folder right?
2009-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	yes
2009-07-22T08:29:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	if you select a partition as / (root) than it will contain the /home directory ,why do you want to create seperate /home directory in making another partition ?
2009-07-22T08:29:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I don't understand why you keep telling me that then. I said I want an explanation of how to reinstall WITHOUT deleting my home folder. Please don't offer advice on how to do something I'm not trying to do.
2009-07-22T08:30:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	i think you are creating needless extra /home directory in /dev/sda6
2009-07-22T08:31:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	if you select a partition as root ("/ ") then it will automatically contain the /home directory
2009-07-22T08:31:00.000Z	twig11	Pidgin_	I put home on a separate partition precisely so I wouldn't have to import my data again if I reinstalled. Now I'm ready to reinstall and I'm not sure how to do that while leaving /dev/sda6 intact. could you just explain what I want to know instead of telling me what I'm doing is needless?
2009-07-22T08:33:00.000Z	twig11		From the Desktop CD installer for Jaunty, what do I need to do to reinstall the operating system without affecting /dev/sda6 where I have my home folder?
2009-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	Pidgin_	twig11	well, i think  if you reinstall you will lose all data of your /home directory
