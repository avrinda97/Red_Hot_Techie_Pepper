2006-08-06T09:20:00.000Z	wheels3572		Ok.  I only have 1 slight problem.  101 is supposedly taken but I have no devices that are taking it lol.  See my Desktop is 100 and then my laptop is 102 (I have NO IDEA where 101 is being used at)
2006-08-06T09:21:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	can you ping it? Are you using wifi?
2006-08-06T09:22:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	it's unpingable and yes I am on wireless
2006-08-06T09:24:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	yes but they have to be up and running.
2006-08-06T09:25:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	you're basing the assumption of a 101 device on the fact that your devices are 100 and 102, yes? What's running the DHCP server?
2006-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	Exactly what I am basing that on
2006-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	Oh: and can you currently ping 100 and 102 from eachother?
2006-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	No, I'm asking you, how do you know theres a 101 device?
2006-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	let me double check that
2006-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	because my internal ips aren't in synch.  If 101 wasn't being used wouldn't it be picked up and used and not skipped?
2006-08-06T09:27:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	okay that's what I thought you were saying: just double-checking.
2006-08-06T09:28:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	it is possible that one of your other devices had temporarily got 101, and then were reassigned for one reason or another. If your network's not locked down, it's also possible a neighbor or somesuch was using it temporarily. But, if they're not currently connected, you wouldn't be able to determine much. /Except/, your DHCP server should have a record of what MAC address it assigned 101 to.
2006-08-06T09:28:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	were you able to ping?
2006-08-06T09:29:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	can I get you in a side window cuz I would like to see if something picked up on my mac address just dont know ho to do that lol
2006-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	Ok I will stay here :) lol
2006-08-06T09:31:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	 what operating system is your DHCP server running on?
2006-08-06T09:32:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	Linux Ubuntu Dapper 6.06
2006-08-06T09:33:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	what program are you using as the dhcp server?
2006-08-06T09:33:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	I dont know what you mean lol.  I am using a Linksys wireless router that has dhcp enabled
2006-08-06T09:34:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	^^
2006-08-06T09:35:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	what does ^^ mean
2006-08-06T09:36:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	Yes I do
2006-08-06T09:37:00.000Z	micahcowan	wheels3572	I probably can't tell you much more than to look at your router's documentation, and try to find out where it keeps logs of assigning IPs to MAC addresses (it may be fairly intuitive from the interface)
2006-08-06T09:38:00.000Z	wheels3572	micahcowan	I can tell you this I JUST turned my laptop on and it went straight to 102 and my desktop is 100 lol.  I am gonna search the logs now ty
