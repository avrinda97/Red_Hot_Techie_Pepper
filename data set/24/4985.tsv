2006-11-21T11:47:00.000Z	soplix	globe	i've got a laptop and I surpose the cable should be fine. it haven't happened before in windows
2006-11-21T11:47:00.000Z	globe	soplix	lol...probably is if it is a laptop
2006-11-21T11:48:00.000Z	soplix	globe	have another clue about what can be wrong?
2006-11-21T11:48:00.000Z	globe	soplix	do you have the correct drivers?
2006-11-21T11:55:00.000Z	soplix	globe	I use the driver found here in lack of drivers made by SIS: http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsisvga.shtml
2006-11-21T11:56:00.000Z	globe	soplix	does it only happen in gui?
2006-11-21T11:57:00.000Z	soplix	globe	it doesn't happen often so I don't know if it will happen without gui
2006-11-21T11:58:00.000Z	globe	soplix	it just freaks out every so often?
2006-11-21T12:03:00.000Z	soplix	globe	could you do me a favour and read some of this http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsispart1.shtml#13 and see it that have something to do with my problem?
2006-11-21T12:03:00.000Z	globe	soplix	yep...
2006-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	globe	soplix	I don't know.  What is your screen res?
2006-11-21T12:06:00.000Z	soplix	globe	1280 + 800
2006-11-21T12:07:00.000Z	globe	soplix	try decreasing it and see if that helps.  if so, you probably don't hav the independent video ram
2006-11-21T12:09:00.000Z	soplix	globe	 it said something about dedicated local video memory. do you know what that is?
2006-11-21T12:09:00.000Z	globe	soplix	yes.  its when a video card has its own memory onboard.  shared video memory means that it uses the system memory, and must use the system bus to use it (ie. slow).
2006-11-21T12:09:00.000Z	globe	soplix	my laptop has that junk....shared memory
2006-11-21T12:11:00.000Z	soplix	globe	do you know how I can check wherether my pc uses dedicated local video memory?
2006-11-21T12:11:00.000Z	globe	soplix	if you know the model number of the laptop, google it.
2006-11-21T12:19:00.000Z	soplix	globe	it used shared video memory
2006-11-21T12:19:00.000Z	globe	soplix	I figured.
2006-11-21T12:20:00.000Z	soplix	globe	that means that there was a problem with the video card and the driver. crap!
2006-11-21T12:20:00.000Z	globe	soplix	I feel your pain
