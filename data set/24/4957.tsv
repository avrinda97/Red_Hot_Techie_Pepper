2006-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	oOKenTOo		i have som problems when i boot after i have installed ubuntu or debian when i boot and boot up in ubuntu or debian it's working fine but i have all so windows on my computer on a other hdd.. but if i choose to boot in windows and reboot i get a wierd error i think it is... it boot until i reach loading grub stage 1.5 and reboot again and do it for ever until i install ubuntu or debian again..
2006-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	oOKenTOo		it is my first time to really try any kind of linux on my computer so don't give me all those fancy words that i don't really get, if you know what i mean...
2006-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	So in fact you can't boot windows, but you can boot on linux.
2006-12-02T07:01:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	no not after i boot in windows.. after that i have to reinstall linux again..
2006-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	And this windows installatin is your old one that you made smaller with a partition tool?
2006-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	i allready have installed windows before i intalled linux.. but when i intalled linux i installed it on a new empty hdd..
2006-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	Ok. So the two OS are on seperate hdd. And the linux hdd is master?
2006-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	my windows hdd is IDE 1 master and the Linux hdd is IDE 2 master
2006-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	grub is stored in which boot sector? hdd-win or hdd-linux?
2006-12-02T07:09:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	hdd-win (i think..not sure...but allmost sure)
2006-12-02T07:10:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	I would probably set the hdd-linux as IDE 1 slave...
2006-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	hmm okay.. and if that is not working got any others ideas?
2006-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	minimec		oO or even better ... do a clean linux install and set hdd-linux as IDE1 master and hdd-win as IDE slave and configure burb afterwards...
2006-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	or even better ... do a clean linux install and set hdd-linux as IDE1 master and hdd-win as IDE slave and configure burb afterwards...
2006-12-02T07:13:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	hmm okay... is there any way to remove the grub loader and get the computer to reboot normally?
2006-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	on win or on linux? You have the possibility to configure the master boot secot with the live CD, I think.
2006-12-02T07:15:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	so i could reboot in windows for now?
2006-12-02T07:16:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	Hmm.. Modifying grub... htere should be a possibility, but I am not sure.
2006-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	well yeah.. but i don't really know how to, because it is my first time to use linux...
2006-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	I would set hdd-linux as IDE master and hdd-win as IDE 1 slave... then do a clean ubuntu install. The windows Os should be recignized during the installation process...
2006-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	oOKenTOo	minimec	hmm i'll give it a try.. thanks for the help anyway..
2006-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	minimec	oOKenTOo	sorry for the typing errors ...
