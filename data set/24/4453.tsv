2007-04-16T10:55:00.000Z	Andeh		Ok... ill have a look
2007-04-16T10:55:00.000Z	Andeh		Thanks
2007-04-16T10:55:00.000Z	Andeh		works now
2007-04-16T10:56:00.000Z	Andeh		Ok, i got into my routers config
2007-04-16T10:56:00.000Z	Andeh		HOW, do i get it to use my webserver instead?
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	Andeh		Ok, this is weird. Can i get my router to forward port 80 to my server, but change the config on another port?
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	Andeh		I mean port 80 opens my router config, can i change that to another port
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	Andeh		anyone
2007-04-16T10:57:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- whatare you trying to achieve?
2007-04-16T10:58:00.000Z	Andeh	ajehuk	Get my LAMP server online so visitors dont get forwarded to my Routers config :D
2007-04-16T11:00:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- so you need to port forward 80 (from outside) to 80 on the machine with the webserver on it, if ou router supports port forwarding that should be all you need to do - if you router is configurable from the web that is probably a bad thing anyway (unless its ssh or https)
2007-04-16T11:02:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- posting here - I guess so..
2007-04-16T11:03:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- whats the IP?
2007-04-16T11:04:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- Its worse if it doesnt ask for a login... :) - but no - timeout here too
2007-04-16T11:09:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- still no page on that IP
2007-04-16T11:09:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- ftp server, telnet, and a few other bits open and responding... but no webserver...
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	Andeh	ajehuk	that sucks. How do i fix it?
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- depends on your router
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- I suggest you nip over to grc.com - take a look at the sheilds up part of that site, just so you get an idea of what you are opening up to the web...
2007-04-16T11:31:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	- you router wouldnt be a Necomm NB1300 DSL router would it?
2007-04-16T11:32:00.000Z	ajehuk	Andeh	 - ou havent set your pc up with the same IP as your router have you?
2007-04-16T11:32:00.000Z	Andeh	ajehuk	No, and i said my routers retarded
