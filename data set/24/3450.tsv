2008-07-25T18:53:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	my file doesn't have one
2008-07-25T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	how do you mean?
2008-07-25T18:43:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	well, say I want to use mplayer to play a file, I type 'mplayer' and then the beginning of the file name followed by TAB so that it completes the name. However, I discovered that ubuntu uses a file called '/etc/bash_completion' that restricts the file names that get completed according to their extension. For instance I can use the auto completion if my file name is for instance 'file.mpg', but not if it's just
2008-07-25T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	if the file is in the current directory you must use ./
2008-07-25T18:44:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	that doesn't work
2008-07-25T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	is the fileexecutable?
2008-07-25T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	so you can type mplay<tab> ./somef<tab>
2008-07-25T18:45:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	I'm not actually typing tab
2008-07-25T18:46:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	but as I said, this doesn't work if the file doesn't have one of the extensions specified for mplayer in '/etc/bash_completion'
2008-07-25T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	I thought it just read the files locally and suggested
2008-07-25T18:51:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	no, it apparently doesn't work like that on ubuntu (I'm a recent convert from fedora). That's an interesting feature I think, but I'm looking for a way to temporarily bypass it
2008-07-25T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	i tab everything just fine, ive never heard of thisbash file before you told me
2008-07-25T18:52:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	well, try to mplayer some file with no extension. It shouldn't work
2008-07-25T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	im at work on xp, sorry
2008-07-25T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	how do you mean? Like dont type the file extension of the file?
2008-07-25T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	or does your file not have one
2008-07-25T18:55:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	it knows by parsing the file
2008-07-25T18:55:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	it doesn't
2008-07-25T18:57:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	well, you can't always do that. For instance, if you want to play the temporary flv files that you get when you're browsing a site with videos like youtube, these files are named FlashXXXX in /tmp/
2008-07-25T18:57:00.000Z	Pedrolito	ActionParsnip	but anyway, thanks for the help
2008-07-25T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Pedrolito	is there any switches for mplayer to help it
