2012-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	zack6849		its pretty much brand new
2012-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	if you are getting the cd booted and from the try ubuntu gui you get a blinking cursor check out the bots link on nomodeset.
2012-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	are you getting to the try ubuntu gui
2012-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	you did not read the link it tells you what to do there.
2012-08-09T09:07:00.000Z	zack6849	wilee-nilee	no i m not
2012-08-09T09:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	Ah I see, then I don't kmow.
2012-08-09T09:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	have you checked the md5sum of the disc
2012-09-26T04:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	you using the something other manual install option?
2012-09-26T04:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	Can you be a little more clear on what you are doing ay least for me and be sure to use nicks. ;)
2012-09-26T04:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	A true dual boot is partitioned installs, the ubuntu install from windows is only a file in windows.
2012-09-26T04:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	Are doing a manual install from the something else option on the live cd install?
2012-09-26T04:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	And how are you doing that?
2012-09-26T04:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	If you were paying attention at the gui before that one there was a something else option, this is why I asked you that first.
2012-09-26T04:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	Not sure to be honest we are not really communicating, so I can't help in good concious. ;)
2012-09-26T04:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zack6849	I think the channel in general is your best help with the info you have given, someone can do it no biggie. ;)
