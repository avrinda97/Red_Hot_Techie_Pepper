2006-05-04T11:28:00.000Z	gill		hello all
2006-05-04T11:29:00.000Z	gill		I need help with a printer... it's just not giving me any errors or anything.
2006-05-04T11:30:00.000Z	soundray	gill	printer errors go into /var/log/cups/ . Make sure you have ghostscript installed.
2006-05-04T11:32:00.000Z	gill	soundray	Printer fault!
2006-05-04T11:33:00.000Z	gill	soundray	a number of tools which do things with the printer directly like escputill don't seem to beable to even query it.
2006-05-04T11:34:00.000Z	soundray	gill	try with sudo
2006-05-04T11:34:00.000Z	gill	soundray	it is a new printer so all the things are flashing on it
2006-05-04T11:34:00.000Z	gill	soundray	that was will sudo
2006-05-04T11:34:00.000Z	soundray	gill	is it supported? linuxprinting.org is a good source
2006-05-04T11:35:00.000Z	gill	soundray	sure is 'mostly'
2006-05-04T11:37:00.000Z	soundray	gill	how do you mean "all the things are flashing on it"?
2006-05-04T11:39:00.000Z	gill	soundray	it didn't have ink in it. I've fix that now
2006-05-04T11:40:00.000Z	soundray	gill	yeah, inkjet printers kind of depend on ink...
2006-05-04T11:40:00.000Z	gill	soundray	sometimes you just have to RTFM
2006-05-04T11:41:00.000Z	soundray	gill	if all else fails...
2006-05-04T11:51:00.000Z	gill	soundray	haha, the test print is just ejecting every pice of paper one by one ;-)
2006-05-04T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	gill	at least there's progress ;)
2006-05-04T11:55:00.000Z	gill	soundray	indeed now mtink works and detects the printer and the ink levels but escutill is still dead
2006-05-04T11:57:00.000Z	soundray	gill	much as I dislike recommending closed software, sometimes the only way to get a (newer) printer working is Turboprint.
2006-05-04T11:57:00.000Z	gill	soundray	I think if I can get the correct ppd it might work better, using the generic Epson Stylus ppd might not be so good. at least I know the escutill works to an extent
2006-05-04T12:00:00.000Z	gill	soundray	interestinly gutenprint isn't available via apt-get
2006-05-04T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	gill	it's probably still called gimp-print in the repos
2006-05-04T12:04:00.000Z	gill	soundray	it's insalled, does that means it's an old version? should I download it drectly and compile it?
2006-05-04T12:05:00.000Z	soundray	gill	if you feel up to it, sure. If you're conservative, its better to stick with what the repositories provide.
