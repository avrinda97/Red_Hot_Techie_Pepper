2007-11-01T17:48:00.000Z	arcticblue		so, what happened to XV on Nvidia cards?
2007-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	arcticblue		XV video playback
2007-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	arcticblue		VLC and Mplayer use this as the default
2007-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	arcticblue		all i get is green blocks
2007-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	arcticblue		this makes using mythtv near impossible
2007-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	arcticblue		this is on a clean install too
2007-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	are you using Compiz?
2007-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	arcticblue		no
2007-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	XV can be enabled in xorg.conf, though the xorg config application in 7.10 may support this option also.
2007-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	arcticblue		so the default behavior is to disable XV support which many multimedia apps use?
2007-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	i don't think so. you may have manipulated your xorg.conf however.
2007-11-01T17:52:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	if not, then i would consider looking at the video overlay and opengl overlay options. they are toggles.
2007-11-01T17:52:00.000Z	arcticblue		haven't touched it.  like i said, it's a clean install.  just finished installing about an hour ago
2007-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	right, odd. have you tried passing mplayer alternative output flags to see if the problem is more general?
2007-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	arcticblue		i can watch videos using the X11 output module
2007-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	can you look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see if the option VideoOverlay is set to On?
2007-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	arcticblue	delire	would that be in the device section?
2007-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	yes, i believe so.
2007-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	just grep or it. if it's not there it's "off"
2007-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	arcticblue	delire	no, there is no VIdeoOverlay option
2007-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	which card and driver combination are you running?
2007-11-01T17:55:00.000Z	arcticblue		it's an on-board 6100.  I'm using the restricted drivers
2007-11-01T17:56:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	right. well at this stage i'd search around to see if NVIDIA fully supports xv output with that card.
2007-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	delire	arcticblue	stranger ommissions have occurred.
