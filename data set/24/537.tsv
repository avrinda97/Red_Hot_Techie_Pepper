2011-06-20T10:39:00.000Z	elssha		what is the difference between regular ubuntu 10.04 and the netbook ed of 10.04? I just got an Aspire 1 and am debating between the two ve3rsions
2011-06-20T10:39:00.000Z	elssha		versions*
2011-06-20T10:40:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	netbook edition uses unity.  but you can still switch to classic ubuntu
2011-06-20T10:41:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	the 10.04 unity is different from current unity.  whole words e.g. 'System' are displayed on the left of the desktop
2011-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	repos are the same
2011-06-20T10:50:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	ubuntu classic is usually more responsive than the netbook edition unity...  though unity 2d (builtin) is pretty responsive too on older netbooks
2011-06-20T10:54:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	if you use netbook, you can try default install. if too slow use unity 2d or ubuntu classic.  actually i dont think you'll miss too much if you just use vanilla 10.04 rather than the netbook edition.  They just look different and just depends on preference
2011-06-20T11:07:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	maybe it's memory can be upgraded to 4GB
2011-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	you'll still be using ubuntu...  desktop is different
2011-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	yes
2011-06-20T10:59:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	i believe lubuntu is lxde
2011-06-20T11:00:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	but since there are differences so cant expect everything to work as is, but repos would be there
2011-06-20T11:00:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	lxde is about being light...  you probably could run frills.. but if you want to do that just use gnome
2011-06-20T11:01:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	:)
2011-06-20T11:03:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	yeah you can choose your desktop manager from login screen
2011-06-20T11:03:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	how much memory you have?
2011-06-20T11:05:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	64 bit programs usually use more memory and hard drive space.  You can install either 32 bit or 64 bit if your processor supports it.  Since you have 2 gig ram, 32 bit should be good.  64bit for 4gb mem and up
2011-06-20T11:08:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	k...  only way to know for sure is to try it out.  but use 32 bits first
2011-06-20T11:10:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	:)
2011-06-20T11:12:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	pretty good netbook
2011-06-20T11:21:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	ubuntu / linux is good at that. it uses only necessary CPU...  keeps things minimal...   you'll probably dual boot windows and ubuntu?  so you'll have an alternative if one OS goes down
2011-06-20T11:31:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	on regular 10.04 if you enable effects, you can use the SUPER (windows) key and tab to flip through your open programs
2011-06-20T11:33:00.000Z	jkbrntot	elssha	ah you mean workspaces...
