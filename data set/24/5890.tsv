2006-07-31T14:29:00.000Z	ailean		I'm trying to install the nVidia drivers but keep getting errors on startup. Im changing my xorg.conf  from "nv" to "nvidia" and have installed the program straight from nvidia.com. what could I be doing wrong?
2006-07-31T14:30:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	maybe you should have installed the driver in the repos, installing from nvidia is more ... complex
2006-07-31T14:31:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	is the driver in the repos as good? I seem to remember doing it last year and it was pathetic
2006-07-31T14:32:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	i'm talking about the nvidia driver, not the community made driver; it's in the repos and it works just fine; anyway, there might be a guide for installing drivers from nvidia, let me find it
2006-07-31T14:34:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	what are the names of the nvidia driver and the community made driver so i know?
2006-07-31T14:34:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	and now that i've installed the driver from nvidia.com, can i remove it?
2006-07-31T14:34:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	this thread might help you: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074
2006-07-31T14:34:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	ta
2006-07-31T14:35:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	afaik, the closed source driver is "nvidia" and the community one is "nv"
2006-07-31T14:35:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	don't know if you can remove it
2006-07-31T14:36:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	yes, that is the package, but when refering to it in the /ect/X11/xorg.conf file, "nvidia" is used
2006-07-31T14:37:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	what chipset does your video card has?
2006-07-31T14:37:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	i don't know what you mean by that :$
2006-07-31T14:37:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	because if you have an loder card, you might need to install the nvidia-glx-legacy package
2006-07-31T14:37:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	no, it's ok
2006-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	i checked that already :)
2006-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	ok
2006-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	thanks
2006-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	ur welcome
2006-07-31T14:50:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	thanks - i got SOMETHING installed anyway :)
2006-07-31T14:51:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	anything is easy to install on ubuntu
2006-07-31T14:51:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	yeah, I thought it was older than this
2006-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	zugu	ailean	it still gets better
2006-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	ailean	zugu	well it has to get better in terms of EASE of use, but it can do everything windows or apple can
