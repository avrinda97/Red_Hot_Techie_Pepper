2009-03-07T22:34:00.000Z	LinuxUser_	Dr_willis_AAO	 It is PNG files, all off then.
2009-03-07T22:34:00.000Z	LinuxUser_	Dr_willis_AAO	 But how do i install the theme for my icons.
2009-03-07T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_AAO	LinuxUser_	 so use them then.. they are not a gnome theme.. so yiu just use them as if they were normal images.. OR are they a gnome icon theme>
2009-03-07T22:34:00.000Z	LinuxUser_	Dr_willis_AAO	 yes it is
2009-03-07T22:35:00.000Z	LinuxUser_	Dr_willis_AAO	 it is a gnome icon theme.
2009-03-07T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis_AAO	LinuxUser_	 yoi did NOT need to extract them.. and  why are they .zip ed?
2009-03-07T22:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis_AAO	LinuxUser_	 you can insall nome theme parts by just drag/dropping the file onto the gnome appearancess contril-panel window.
