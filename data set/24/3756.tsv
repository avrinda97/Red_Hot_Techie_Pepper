2008-08-23T05:39:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	I figured out my problem... but now I have to figure out a way to correc it :/ and there's not much in your xorg.conf that can help I don't think
2008-08-23T05:39:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	ok, what's the problem?
2008-08-23T05:40:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	nvidia is getting a bad EDID from my monitor. However... my monitor doesn't have a bad EDID. It's just using EDID 1.3 and, apparently, nvidia can't read this correctly
2008-08-23T05:41:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	oh ok. I haven't had that happen to me. Using the latest drivers etc? I think there even was an update today, but I didn't look to see what it included.

2008-08-23T05:42:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	same here. Don't think I can help you with this one, sorry.
2008-08-23T05:43:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	well, thanks for helping me get to where I am :) Now that I know the problem, it'll be easier to search for what people already have done

2008-08-23T05:48:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	do you have experience with virtual box?

2008-08-23T07:47:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	you use twinview, right?
2008-08-23T07:49:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	for the moment yes. I used Xinerama before.
2008-08-23T07:50:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	I'm not sure if there's a setting for that. But I think I saw something in Compiz dealing with window placement. I don't remember exactly what tho.
2008-08-23T07:52:00.000Z	TwoD	ShdwShinobi	I'm heading to bed really soon, but pm me if you've got more questions and I could take a look at it in the morning.
2008-08-23T07:52:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	TwoD	ok, will do. Thanks for all the help!
