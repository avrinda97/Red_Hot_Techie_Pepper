2008-07-15T03:49:00.000Z	travis		Is there a way to "translate" in xorg language the screen configuration of the windows nvidia control center?
2008-07-15T03:49:00.000Z	travis		i know i repeat myself but theres people coming inside
2008-07-15T03:49:00.000Z	travis		mabe they know
2008-07-15T03:51:00.000Z	travis		Is there a way to "translate" in xorg language the screen configuration of the windows nvidia control center?
2008-07-15T03:51:00.000Z	travis		i mean the values of that configuration
2008-07-15T03:52:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	if you're using the nvidia restricted driver, there is also a special nvidia settings editor program
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	you can install the "nvidia-settings" package
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	travis	ScottWegner	ive got the nvidia-settings and nvidia-clock installed, but theres no way of making a customized configuration as in windows
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	is there something in particular you're trying to configure that you don't see there?
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	travis		i've got the values of the windows program, i just don't know where to put them
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	travis		yes
2008-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	travis		the screen
2008-07-15T03:54:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	well, what about the screen?  the nvidia setting application has many configuration fields
2008-07-15T03:54:00.000Z	travis		windows control center has a personalized screen section built in
2008-07-15T03:54:00.000Z	travis		i know
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	travis		but mabe theres a way to fill in that values by hand directly into xorg
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	I imagine that the configuration file format isn't exactly the same between windows and Linux
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	travis		so the screen works smoothly
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	I'm not aware of any direct "translation" utility
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	travis		refresh rates
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	travis		horizontal sync
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	travis		etc...
2008-07-15T03:56:00.000Z	travis		active horizontal pixels
2008-07-15T03:56:00.000Z	ScottWegner	travis	the settings for nvidia are saved in the fiile ~/.nvidia-settings-rc -- you can check this file to see if the format is similar to Windows
