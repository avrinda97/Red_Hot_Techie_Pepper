2010-02-06T03:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	cdimage.ubuntu.com
2010-12-20T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	not it doesnt will or touch windows
2010-12-20T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	it simpley replaced the master boot record on the disk
2010-12-20T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	no it hasn't grub does not touch windows
2010-12-20T22:40:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	that could be the issue there
2010-12-20T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	what could be the issue ?
2010-12-20T22:40:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	it does not touch windows so much it does not even show up
2010-12-20T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	it doesn't need to touch it to make it show up
2010-12-20T22:41:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	Its just something nice that could be touched on :p
2010-12-20T22:42:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	I'll be off than, no need for me to troll around sense nobody cares much about graphical blank spots on panel bars
2010-12-20T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	ok
2010-12-20T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	yes
2010-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	.exe's are for windows
2010-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	research "shell scripts" and "crontabl"
2010-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	I just want to know the equivalent of a batch file. <- .bat is also windows.
2010-12-20T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	a shell script
2010-12-20T22:50:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	idk how to use shell script. If you could give me an example of it starting the following line in a terminal it would be great. mana -u -d Documents/OpenSourceProjects/Tmw/mainline/ -p 6901 -s 127.0.0.1
2010-12-20T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	research shell scripts
2010-12-20T22:51:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	I did and it does not look anywhere near as easy as .bat files
2010-12-20T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	it's not
2010-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	so why say its the equivalent ?
2010-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Meway	because it is the same thing, it's just not as easy, but it is once you start to use it
2010-12-20T22:54:00.000Z	Meway	ikonia	ok I guess I have no choice than. :/
