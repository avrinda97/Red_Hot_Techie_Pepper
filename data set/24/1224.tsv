2010-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	marel		`edit etc/fstab` doesn't work, it says that I have no permission.
2010-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	marel		How do I edit it ?
2010-05-10T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2010-11-25T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	gedit filename ,will run gedit and open the file
2010-11-25T01:32:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	the problem is that this command you've specified opens gedit in terminal, which means untill I close gedit I can't do anything else in terminal..
2010-11-25T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	then suffix with an ampersand
2010-11-25T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	gedit filename &
2010-11-25T01:34:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	thanks.
2010-11-25T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	if you aren't the owner you can run: gksudo gedit filename & ,to run gedit with elevated access
2011-04-14T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	what plugin do they use? flash? java?
2011-04-14T22:18:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	I think java, when I played it on windows, I had to install java.
2011-04-28T20:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	sudo -i
2011-05-02T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	log off and log in to gnome classic
2012-01-04T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	yes, you will need to resize your NTFS and install to the free space
2012-01-09T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	I'd use:  dpkg -l  | grep  part        change part for some of the name of the app you installed
2012-01-09T02:02:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	I don't can't find this package I've installed, however if I search it it shows that it exists.
2012-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	you will then have the name of the package, you can then use:  sudo apt-get --purge remove name
2012-01-09T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	what is the name of the deb you installed?
2012-01-09T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	try:   dpkg -l | grep charm
2012-01-09T02:04:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	I tried this, but I didn't find that package..
2012-01-09T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	if you run:  history | grep dpkg     does it give a deb name?
2012-01-09T02:06:00.000Z	marel	ActionParsnip	no. Perhaps it wasn't a .deb package..
2012-01-09T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	then try:  history | grep apt-get
2012-01-10T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	marel	gedit &
