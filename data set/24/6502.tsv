2008-09-13T20:32:00.000Z	paolo		well: now, if i type sudo apt-get install build-essential konsole says that it's named by another package etc.
2008-09-13T20:33:00.000Z	paolo		and i can't install it
2008-09-13T20:33:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	is there no way for you to network that machine temporarily?
2008-09-13T20:34:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	then you should try using apt offline. Hold on, I'll dig out a URL
2008-09-13T20:34:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	yes, that's what i was searching for
2008-09-13T20:34:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	http://batmat.net/apt-offline/
2008-09-13T20:34:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	it's written for Debian, but it should all apply.
2008-09-13T20:35:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	let's have a look, thnks
2008-09-13T20:38:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	unfortunately the document is old and poor. but, i insist: i only have to pick the build essential .deb packages needed for kubuntu 8.04
2008-09-13T20:39:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	no, there isn't. Apt is designed for networked computers. Working around the issue is complex.
2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	i insist again, it would be complex if you have to install several packages. in my case i have only to install few
2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	that package is empty. It consists only of dependencies. It wouldn't help if you installed only build-essential.
2008-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	anyway, downloading individual packages is through packages.ubuntu.com
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	in fact i only need the list of dependecies
2008-09-13T20:41:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	'apt-cache depends build-essential'
2008-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	it didn't give me anything
2008-09-13T20:42:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	no output, no errro?
2008-09-13T20:44:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	did you enter precisely the command, and nothing else?
2008-09-13T20:44:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	checked. yes
2008-09-13T20:45:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	did it return to a $ prompt?
2008-09-13T20:45:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	yes
2008-09-13T20:48:00.000Z	soundray	paolo	does 'apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop' give you a list of dependencies?
2008-09-13T20:49:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	yes
2008-09-13T20:52:00.000Z	paolo	soundray	probably i've solved. i'm picking the build essential package directly from the cd
