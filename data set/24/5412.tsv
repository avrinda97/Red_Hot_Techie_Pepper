2006-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	Novagenesis		lol...interesting... Synaptic only sees x86 stuff...how do I add 64-bit capability to my apt?
2006-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	Novagenesis		no, joejaxx, I installed the 32-bit...i was thinking of trying to update on the fly ;)
2006-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	Novagenesis		hey,. it's not the gutsiest (dumbest) move I've ever made
2006-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	Novagenesis		and I'm more than willing to stick with ext3 :-D
2006-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	haha that was not dumb :P i actually use reiserfs
2006-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	automaitx is not a really good idea :(
2006-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	Novagenesis	joejaxx	 thanks for not botspammin like the other person did....so what's particularly wrong with automatix?
2006-11-23T08:48:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	it use scripts and things are not packaged right, it can break your system, you might not see it presently but when you go to update or upgrade to a newer release things are going to break it has happened to alot of people with edgy despite the authors little statement about this channel on the website :(
2006-11-23T08:48:00.000Z	Novagenesis	joejaxx	fun....guess i still gotta go the way I went in Dapper with my last system
2006-11-23T08:48:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	yeah probably so
2006-11-23T08:49:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	haha yeah me either, i just wish there was a way to educate people about automatix
2006-11-23T08:51:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	i do not know as i do not have 64bit pcs well i do but they are old sun sparcstations haha 233mhz
2006-11-23T08:52:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	i do not know for sure but i do not think it will
2006-11-23T08:53:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	if you are going to try it make sure you install 64bit and then reboot into it
2006-11-23T08:53:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	then after a couple of days (or hours or minutes depending on how your system feels ) if everything is stable then remove the 386
2006-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	did you install the 64bit version of ubuntu?
2006-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	haha :)
2006-11-23T08:56:00.000Z	Novagenesis	joejaxx	yeah, but reiser's a killer now ;P
2006-11-23T08:56:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	lool  :P
2006-11-23T08:56:00.000Z	Novagenesis	joejaxx	but yeah...erm...so I take it doing an on-the-fly upgrade is totally impossible?
2006-11-23T08:57:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	i do not know if trying to upgrade from a 32bit version of ubuntu to a 64bit version is going to work at all
2006-11-23T08:57:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	:)
2006-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	:)
2006-11-23T09:35:00.000Z	joejaxx	Novagenesis	haha
