2005-09-12T14:14:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	great :)
2005-09-12T14:00:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	why would you need that ?
2005-09-12T14:00:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	apparently to burn cd's...
2005-09-12T14:00:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	2.4 kernel ?
2005-09-12T14:00:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	xcdroast wont detect my burner...
2005-09-12T14:00:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	then u dont need scsi emu
2005-09-12T14:01:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	well perhaps you could help me to figure out how to have my drive be detected in Xcdroast?  :-)
2005-09-12T14:01:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	do you have an empty cd in your cdburner ?
2005-09-12T14:02:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	no i do not, but i wouldnt think that would effect the burner being detected by the program
2005-09-12T14:02:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	please try
2005-09-12T14:03:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	same problem.  "no cd writer or cdrom device detected"...
2005-09-12T14:04:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	strange , did you try another burnprog like graveman ?
2005-09-12T14:05:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	no, not yet.
2005-09-12T14:06:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	I would try graveman to see if that detects your burner
2005-09-12T14:06:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	i just tried eroaster as well, also unable to detect
2005-09-12T14:06:00.000Z	deFrysk	vanberge	no clue
2005-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	vanberge	deFrysk	graveman works
