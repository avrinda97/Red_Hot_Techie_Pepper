2009-10-26T05:56:00.000Z	ubuntu_		hey guys, EXTREME Ubuntu n00b here.....how the heck does one upgrade FF in Ubuntu.  I DL'ed the 3.5 file, but this is so different from Vista, im lost!
2009-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_		so, i should stick with what i have then?
2009-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	d9500	ubuntu_	you want firefox 3.5, right?
2009-10-26T05:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_		and, compared to Vista, this is INCREDIBLY slow.  Any ideas?
2009-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_		which is?
2009-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_		okay, i dont see that listed in my add-ons
2009-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	d9500	ubuntu_	if by "which is?" you mean what is gnash, it is a reverse engineered open source/free software implementation of adobe flash player.
2009-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_	d9500	thanks for the explanation
2009-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_		where is that.....ive been running Ubuntu for litereally 10 mins
2009-10-26T06:00:00.000Z	d9500	ubuntu_	hit alt+f2 on your keyboard, and then type "gnome-system-monitor" (without the quotes)
2009-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_		yessir
2009-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_		was just fixing to reply
2009-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_		system monitor is up
2009-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_		nothing like that is listed
2009-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_		yes
2009-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_		the live cd
2009-10-26T06:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		havent done a complete install yet, as i was unsure about what i was getting into
2009-10-26T06:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		i apologize for not saying that right off the bat then
2009-10-26T06:03:00.000Z	d9500	ubuntu_	if you're using a 9.04 live CD, you should probably go ahead and do the install before you try to upgrade firefox to 3.5, if that's what you're looking to do. otherwise, the new firefox won't be saved to your installed apps next time you run the cd.
2009-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_		i mainly just wanted to explore, and play with this OS before i committed to it 100%
2009-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_		so far, its not that bad, IMO
2009-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		isnit possible to do a install to HDD, and NOT lose my vista.  For reverting purposes?
2009-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_		what is a Wubi?
2009-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	d9500	ubuntu_	yes, wubi will do that, or, should you choose to actually istall ubuntu from the live cd,in most cases, ubuntu's installer will automatically set up a dual-boot for you, provided that you do not try to install ubuntu on the same partition as your vista install
