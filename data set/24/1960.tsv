2009-06-06T04:57:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	no i remember
2009-06-06T04:57:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	cabrey	what does teh about me do other than just have all ur info lol
2009-06-06T04:58:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	pretty much it
2009-06-06T04:59:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	cabrey	just wanted to point out a security issue, before I edited the /etc/fstab and made a mistake where my machine wouldnt work, I then used my live cd to try and make a change, I was able to edit the fstab file using the sudo but it didnt ask me for a password, isnt this a security bug?
2009-06-06T04:59:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	no
2009-06-06T05:00:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	cabrey	so then anyone with a live cd could edit ur files, no?
2009-06-06T05:00:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	when you have physical access to the machine, all bets are off unless you encrypted the hdd
2009-06-06T05:00:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	yup, but you usually can disable cd booting from within the bios, then set a bios password
2009-06-06T05:01:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	cabrey	yeah lol what was weird was that it didnt ask me for a pass that's what i was concerned about
2009-06-06T05:02:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	it's understood
2009-06-06T05:02:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	cabrey	no one has physical access to my PC that i dont want to have, but just something i wanted to mention, :D
2009-06-06T05:03:00.000Z	cabrey	mib_csj1b03z	I am very stingy who touches my netbook :)
