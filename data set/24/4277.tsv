2007-05-17T13:17:00.000Z	dfarje_		hey guys I'm trying to install GKRELLM
2007-05-17T13:17:00.000Z	dfarje_		but it won't allow me to do it, because it says
2007-05-17T13:17:00.000Z	dfarje_		 Depends: libgnutls11 (>=1.0.16) but it is not installable
2007-05-17T13:17:00.000Z	dfarje_		what does it mean when a package is not installable?
2007-05-17T13:18:00.000Z	jrib	dfarje_	pastebin your command, the full error, and the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list

2007-05-17T13:22:00.000Z	jrib	dfarje_	ubotu should have sent you a private message, did you receive it?

2007-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	jrib	dfarje_	remove the breezy repositories from your sources.list
2007-05-17T13:35:00.000Z	jrib	dfarje_	actually, it's probably easier if you just create a new dapper one with universe and multiverse, see:
2007-05-17T13:36:00.000Z	dfarje_	jrib	how do I create a dapper
2007-05-17T13:36:00.000Z	jrib	dfarje_	check your messages from ubotu
