2005-09-14T08:07:00.000Z	elmo_		Can anyone help with a boot error that is preventing me from booting? "pivot_root: no such file or directory" and " /sbin/init:428:cannot open dev/console: no such file"
2005-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	Souns like your / partition isn't where someone expects it to be. Could also be devfs (if such is used) that isn't installed properly in the kernel.
2005-09-14T08:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	What caused this problem to start?
2005-09-14T08:11:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	I tried adding a second hd, a slave to the master that has ubuntu on it. I got no response from grub. I then removed the 2nd hd and tried just booting again. Now I have these errors. thanks for the help.
2005-09-14T08:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	Is your primary harddrive set to Cable Select or spesifically to Master?
2005-09-14T08:15:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	hd set to cs
2005-09-14T08:15:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	Well that might have confused it as grub might have mistaken it for a different drive. Try setting it spesifically to master.
2005-09-14T08:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	If that does not work you might need to re-install grub.
2005-09-14T08:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	To re-install grub: Boot from ubuntu install cd, mkdir /oldinstall, mount your linux partitions there and chroot /oldinstall /bin/bash then run grub and root (hd0,X) and setup (hd0)
2005-09-14T08:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	That should fix it (most likely)
2005-09-14T08:29:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	I have set the hd to master. grub boots ok. but I am still getting the pivot_root and /sbin/init errors. Any ideas?
2005-09-14T08:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	No, not really, sorry. I've never had that problem with any distro and certainly not with ubuntu. :)
2005-09-14T09:00:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	Yes.
2005-09-14T09:01:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	How? I tried with live cd and could not find the path to hd? hey khermans I am a noob and not very proficient with this linux stuff!
2005-09-14T09:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	as root fdisk -l (that will list all harddisks found)
2005-09-14T09:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	If it isn't listed there then tell me what kind of disk you're using.
2005-09-14T09:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	...well you can tell me about your disk anyways.
2005-09-14T09:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	mkdir /ubuntu && mount /dev/hdX /ubuntu && chroot /ubuntu /bin/bash
2005-09-14T09:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	Might need to change X to the partition number and if you have got other partitions you might need to mount them on the appropriate places in the /ubuntu tree.
2005-09-14T10:56:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	Thanks again for your help. I have spent a long time trying to figure out the root terminal commands to do what you suggested, but to no avail. I have tried many variations (i.e. ext2 and 3, hd1 and hd0, different mount commands. Either I am completely inept at operating at terminal commands or the live cd system does not even see the hd.
2005-09-14T10:56:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	sudo fdisk -l
2005-09-14T10:57:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	if it doesn't list your harddisk then it (the kernel) doesn't see it at all....yet
2005-09-14T10:57:00.000Z	BlueEagle	elmo_	if it does list your harddisk then we should be able to mount it.
2005-09-14T10:57:00.000Z	elmo_	BlueEagle	thanks. I will try tomarrow, when I can keep my eys open. You have been very helpful.
