2010-11-14T21:50:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	you'e aware you can type 'GNU\' and hit tab on 99% of all IRC clients and it nick completes eh? I noticed you're typing the entire nick out, and you're doing it wrong also
2010-11-14T21:51:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	Also I hardly think shuttleworth's personal decisions are "calls from a greater majority"
2010-11-14T21:51:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	sorry never noticed that feature ty for pointing it out
2010-11-14T21:53:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	according to the magazines I buy at $20/month each there is a call from the greater majority of users to make some features standard on all linux distrobutions
2010-11-14T21:54:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	one of those being default desktop environment
2010-11-14T21:55:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	yeah, well your magazine is incorrect, there is no majority call for unification,
2010-11-14T21:57:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	thats why you have "open source utilities" is so that you can do this funny thing called "modification" to make what you want
2010-11-14T21:58:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	Yeah well I hate to break your "hackers make GNU/Linux, and if you don't like it, you can make your own" bubble, but GNU/Linux distributions are corporations, they're ran by money, not on the sweat of basement hackers
2010-11-14T21:59:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	hmm thats why my ubuntu has a gnome desktop using PLASMA utilities..... wait a minute many say that cant be done
2010-11-14T22:00:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	bottom line is that if you dont like something CHANGE IT!! and if you cant change it GET LOST!!
2010-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	it doesn't work like that, I make many patches for projects, bring up many bugs, it gets ignored, and I don't have the money to start a ubuntu-level project like shuttleworth does
2010-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	 look at linux puppy as an example of what a SINGLE person can start
2010-11-14T22:02:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	puppy linux is horrible
2010-11-14T22:03:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	 if you hate is so much to be a part of this community the I revert back to GET LOST!!
2010-11-14T22:03:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	there is no community here, there is shuttleworth and paid employees
2010-11-14T22:03:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	I use puppy all the time on broken systems for recovery
2010-11-14T22:04:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	then what are all of us in this room are we not community helping others to make a better system for themselves?!
2010-11-14T22:05:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	 I exclude you from that grouping as you are not contributing to anything but nonsence
2010-11-14T22:08:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	 go blow bill gates then
2010-11-14T22:09:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	 and while your at it turn in your free software irc chat software
2010-11-14T22:10:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	Actually funny you should mention it, I've submitted 5 bugs to xchat, 3 patches for the bugs, and all of it was ignored or re-coded, not only that, I was banned from their IRC channel for bringing up the bugs. So my local client is my own IRC client now, a fork from xchat, so why would I turn it in?
2010-11-14T22:11:00.000Z	dustin_	poutine	lets see you denounce open source yet you build on it to perfect it for your own wants/needs..... hmm sounds like you are part of the community you hate so much, I think I wan tyou voted off this island because you are a buzzkill!!
2010-11-14T22:12:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	I never once stated anything was wrong with open source, I stated that there is no "community" to be found, you're fooling yourself to think ubuntu is about you and not shuttleworth
2010-11-14T22:16:00.000Z	poutine	dustin_	your ubuntu was completely built by shuttleworth, actual "ubuntu devs" do not make the packages that make your GNU/Linux system work, shuttleworth delegates to them to tweak elements of 3rd party apps to give what he thinks the ubuntu experience is. Also You must never update your system, because ubuntu sure wipes out any customizations I add on a nearly regular basis
