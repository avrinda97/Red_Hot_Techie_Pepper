2009-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	G2k		but it keeps stalling. Maybe I need to change the dowload server?
2009-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	ArkoldThos	G2k	use the most close to your country
2009-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	I know that. i already set it in the software sources
2009-10-05T14:00:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	but apparently it hasnt been set on my mounted partition
2009-10-05T14:00:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	only on the livecd
2009-10-05T14:00:00.000Z	ArkoldThos	G2k	change it manually in /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	ArkoldThos	G2k	doubt that is possible :o
2009-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	then how can i fix my partition from livecd
2009-10-05T14:08:00.000Z	ArkoldThos	G2k	try this: sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu
2009-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	thanks
2009-10-05T14:13:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	hmmm its still not letting me apt-get update
2009-10-05T14:13:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	even though I chrooted into the environment
2009-10-05T14:14:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	is there a command that can make me automatically change the sources.list file?
2009-10-05T14:14:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	im not sure i can do it manually
2009-10-05T14:14:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	without ,making a mess that is
2009-10-05T14:24:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	how can i reload the sources list?
2009-10-05T14:24:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	i modified the file
2009-10-05T14:25:00.000Z	G2k	ArkoldThos	oh ok i think its going
2009-10-05T14:25:00.000Z	ArkoldThos	G2k	sudo apt-get update
