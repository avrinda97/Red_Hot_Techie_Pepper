2006-12-28T14:34:00.000Z	madman91		i just got a 300gb hdd... if i want to backup my entire linux install.. can i just use cp -ax /
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	To back it up so you can get at the files? Or to back it up so you can restore exactly your partition from the file?
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	which is better? ... well which is easier
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	If the latter, you might want to consider "dd if=/dev/sda2 of=backupfile" where /dev/sda2 is your Linux partition.
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	Both are pretty easy. It depends what you need to do.
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	i can do both :D
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	If you make a giant tarball out of /, you can then get at files. But if you bitcopy your partition, you can completely restore it with dd if=backupfile of=/dev/sda2
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	is backupfile just backupfile?
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	no extension?
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	backupfile is whatever filename you want your backup to have. Call it fred if you want.
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	i will call it fred :D
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	What extension would it have? It's a copy of a partition.
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	.partition
2006-12-28T14:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	If you want *shrug*
2006-12-28T14:38:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	how do i do incremental or differential backups?
2006-12-28T14:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	I don't do backups. xD Ask someone else.
2006-12-28T14:39:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	if i use dd.. can i access the files inside it ?
2006-12-28T14:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	Not easily. You could mount it as a loopback device. That would require Linux.
2007-05-02T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	To keep your system clean. If you install application foobar, and it installs libfoobar as a dependency. Then you remove foobar, but the libfoobar package is still on your system, being useless.
2007-05-02T09:57:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	no.. not like that.. i mean sometimes aptitude just removes some apps for no reason
2007-05-02T09:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	madman91	Those useless packages which were installed as dependencies for a package which is now removed are cleaned by aptitude.
2007-05-02T09:57:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	it says "not being used" even though i didnt remove any
2007-05-02T09:58:00.000Z	madman91	arrenlex	thanks
