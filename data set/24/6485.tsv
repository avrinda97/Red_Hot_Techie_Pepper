2009-01-19T03:24:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	Thanks, but did they really get rid of "shared folders" in 8.10 ?! I find this very hard to believe
2009-01-19T03:27:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	What is this "main shared directory" you're talking about? You're trying to shared some directory with a Windows machine?
2009-01-19T03:27:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	If so, just use SWAT to set it up. Couldn't be simpler really.
2009-01-19T03:28:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	I installed swat but cannot find it anywhere
2009-01-19T03:28:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	it's a web app
2009-01-19T03:29:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	try http://localhost:901 (I think. I don't use SMB very much any more.)
2009-01-19T03:29:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	No luck with :901... do I need tomcat or apache first?
2009-01-19T03:29:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	No, and no.
2009-01-19T03:29:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	you might have to start swat though.
2009-01-19T03:33:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	In Hardy, SWAT is started from xinetd so it's done on-demand. I just hit http://localhost:901/ and got a user ID and password prompt.
2009-01-19T03:34:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	You should also know that POSIX users != SMB users.
2009-01-19T03:34:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	I know, but I added the samba user
2009-01-19T03:36:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	Just to be sure we're talking about the same thing, if you have a linux account "tamale", that doesn't mean that you can login from Windows via SMB as "tamale". You have to "smbadduser tamale" and "smbpasswd tamala" first.
2009-01-19T03:36:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	Correct, and I have both users added
2009-01-19T03:36:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	Posix and windows
2009-01-19T03:36:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	good. A way around this is to use LDAP, btw. Bit of work to set up but it works great.
2009-01-19T03:37:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	Heh, true.. honestly that 'shared folders' utility was perfect.. and tiny.  I just don't understand why it's missing.  I see it when I go to 'edit menus' even, but it's not in the menus
2009-01-19T03:38:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	I don't know what you're talking about since I don't have a "shared folders" utility in Kubuntu.
2009-01-19T03:38:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	It's been in every version of Ubuntu I've used since 5.10 but nowhere to be found in 8.10
2009-01-19T03:40:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	Oh, you're talking about that "Sharing" think in "Network & Connectivity" in the System Settings. Never used it. I just don'
2009-01-19T03:40:00.000Z	cilkay	tamale	I just don't find that control panel all that useful.
2009-01-19T03:41:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	I don't even see "network and connectivity" in gnome. I don't see any sharing options in "Network tools" or "Network Configuration"
2009-01-19T03:50:00.000Z	tamale	cilkay	Found a package called "gadmin-samba"  maybe this is it
