2008-05-26T12:17:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		anyonw know why i cant browse the network shares using gui, but it works in terminal using smbclient command
2008-05-26T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 ive had similer issues with  the gnome and kde file managers, and the fusesmb tool.. but smb4k worked fine.. NO IDEA why its acting so goofy.  Ive filed a few bug reports but never get an answer. :(
2008-05-26T12:19:00.000Z	d[X_X]b	Dr_willis	good to know thnx.... ive only had this issue with ubuntu 8 however
2008-05-26T12:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 exactly. My other ubuntu boxc's work fine. This issue would happen to me durign the beta testing.. then go away.. then come back.    Ive not checked the forums on it lately.
2008-05-26T12:20:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		and why all of a sudden hardy is mounting shares... i didnt have this in fiesty
2008-05-26T12:21:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		i feel like its acting like mac and less like windows machine when it mounts shares on a wim
2008-05-26T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 i used to use the fusesmb tool all the time.  but it has issues now for me. :(  just as a test i tried smb4k to actually 'mount' the shares - and it worked like a champ. I cant even figure out a good place to start troubleshooting this stuff. :(
2008-05-26T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 technically the kde/gnome file managers dont mount the shares.. they 'browse' them.  smb4k sees and mounts them.
2008-05-26T12:23:00.000Z	d[X_X]b	Dr_willis	but it used to browse and thats it. now its throwing the folder to my desktop and favorites
2008-05-26T12:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 Yep.  - makes it a little hard to troubleshoot. :(
2008-05-26T12:25:00.000Z	d[X_X]b	Dr_willis	and when i rightclick the favorites the only option is unmount so i fig its mounting...
2008-05-26T12:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	  The forums seem to have others with similer issues.. checking for any fix's  (so far none, just a lot of , it affects me also posts)
2008-05-26T12:26:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		dr_willis how do i browse an nfs share? i only know smb://computer
2008-05-26T12:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 i always just mount them. Not sure you can browse nfs likeyou can samba
2008-05-26T12:27:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		dr_willis oh.... so how does one mount it? ie... i use ipaddress as the mount? \
2008-05-26T12:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis		!nfs
2008-05-26T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 i always do it from the command line. or fstab file - for linux to linux - NFS is the way to go. :)
2008-05-26T12:28:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		kewl thnx
2008-05-26T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 or for somthing quick  - i use the sshfs tool
2008-05-26T12:29:00.000Z	d[X_X]b		hmm.. funny i setup an smb/nfs... and i never knew...i tried nfs://computer...it failed haha...thanx dr_willis
2008-05-26T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 nfs is radically different from samba :)
2008-05-26T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 in the forums - people have reported that using the older samba packages - gets their stuff working...  go figure. :)
2008-05-26T12:31:00.000Z	d[X_X]b	Dr_willis	yea unny how updates can be harmful... i lost so much with this upgrade to 8
2008-05-26T12:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	d[X_X]b	 i did a clean install..   not upgrade..  :) and still have the same issue.
