2009-03-07T01:04:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		i was just wondering if there was any way
2009-03-07T01:04:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		I'm not really familiarr w/ all this
2009-03-07T01:05:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		I was just wondering if there was an easy way to do it
2009-03-07T01:05:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		?
2009-03-07T01:06:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		well I'm just trying to figure out this video playback problem. its really choppy and there are horizontal lines... anyone know anything about that? I have all the codecs required
2009-03-07T01:07:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		ubuntu intrepid
2009-03-07T01:07:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		yup
2009-03-07T01:07:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe		doesnt play internet vids well either
2009-03-07T01:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	have you tried experimenting with your video player(s) video output options yet to see if that cimproves things ?
2009-03-07T01:09:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	not really, usually xv or opengl vieo output modes work ok .. just a thought sorry
2009-03-07T01:11:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	yeah its been in open Gl and im running it in xv now and theres no difference
2009-03-07T01:12:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	my friend said he had the same problem and to disable hardware acceleration but ive been trying to figure out how to do that all day w/ noi luck... I'm new to linux btw
2009-03-07T01:13:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	no worries, linux is so broad that everyone is new to some parts of tit .. disabling hardware acceleration is done in /etc/X11/xorg.conf i think, never done it so not really a clue
2009-03-07T01:14:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	so my xorg.conf seems to not have hardly any info in it... is this normal for intrepid?
2009-03-07T01:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	it's typical for the newer version of Xorg server yes, it's meant to be like that to enable 'hotplugging' devices without mangling config files
2009-03-07T01:17:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	oic. um, do you know how I might be able to edit xorg.conf then?
2009-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	try doing a websearch on your graphics card model/type + disable hardware acceleration + ubuntu is about my best advice on thi i'm afraid
2009-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	the actual editing of the xorg.conf file in question is simpler, if you need help on that, give a shout
2009-03-07T01:19:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	ok will do... is there any gui in ubuntu or terminal prompt that I could find  the model type? all i could find was intel integrated extreme graphics card but i think i need more into than that
2009-03-07T01:20:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	if you're looking for a GUI, sudo apt-get install glshw (a GUI for lshw, which lists all available hardware in your system with loads of info
2009-03-07T01:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	my bad, sudo apt-get install lshw-gtk
2009-03-07T01:24:00.000Z	Legumebo_Magezfe	glitsj16	ok it totally worked this time. Thats all I need for now, thank you so much for all the help!
2009-03-07T01:24:00.000Z	glitsj16	Legumebo_Magezfe	very welcome, hope you get some nice hits websearching to solve the issue
