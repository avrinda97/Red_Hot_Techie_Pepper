2010-01-08T05:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	open the file with totem and download the codecs with totem
2010-01-08T05:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	rebooting will not solve anything
2010-01-08T05:09:00.000Z	ja660k	mkanyicy	sorry i still live in the land of windoze
2010-01-08T05:10:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	alternatively, open synaptic and search for 'gstreamer' and select the good, bad, and ugly plugins plus install w32codecs
2010-01-08T05:10:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	I see, only updates or installs that affect the kernel require rebooting
2010-01-08T05:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	let me know if after trying all this does not solve anything
2010-01-08T05:13:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	ok, install ffmpeg, mplayer and vlc
2010-01-08T05:17:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	open terminal and type "mplayer filename" and copy all the message in terminal and pastebin it
2010-01-08T05:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	replace "filename" by a relevant filename
2010-01-08T05:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	replace "filename" by a relevant filename like my_file.m4v
2010-01-08T05:23:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	paste HERE the output of "file filename"
2010-01-08T05:23:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	after that replace mplayer by vlc and pastebin the error messages like before
2010-01-08T05:24:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	I mean do this command exactly like this: file 03\ Chappelle\'s\ Show\ 103.m4v
2010-01-08T05:25:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	that SHOULD NOT give you 34 lines of output
2010-01-08T05:25:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	are you still there?
2010-01-08T05:27:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	mplayer was supposed to play this easily, is this file encrypted, did you purchase it from iTunes ?
2010-01-08T05:28:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	it has DRM
2010-01-08T05:28:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	no player will ever play that on ubuntu
2010-01-08T05:29:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	it is protected, I guess you cannot even play it by any other non-Apple player even on windows
2010-01-08T05:30:00.000Z	ja660k	mkanyicy	bummer... new hatred for apple right now.
2010-01-08T05:31:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ja660k	sorry
