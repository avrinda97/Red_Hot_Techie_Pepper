2010-02-23T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	if you are on live CD now then your HD might not be mounted at all - so it wont show up in baoab or with du
2010-02-23T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	then please type df -h in the console to see how full the partitions are
2010-02-23T02:05:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	/dev/sda5 is full
2010-02-23T02:07:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	I was speaking two thwo or three people helping me. I can single them out again, I suppose
2010-02-23T02:08:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	problem is: when you don't use your partner's  nick  he may not see your answer (we are reading sevearl channels usually)
2010-02-23T02:10:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	but if several people were helping me, its not efficient to single out one person, is it?
2010-02-23T02:11:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	you can use several nicks too - but thats not your problem  I guess
2010-02-23T02:11:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	I didn't understand from that ubot output, how you do several nicks
2010-02-23T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	jonzbcc: jonzbcc: just like this
2010-02-23T02:12:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	OH, I thought irssi only highlights messsages where your name is first.
2010-02-23T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	you type the first characters of a nick, press <tab>, then the next....
2010-02-23T02:15:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	back to your problem: as I said your /dev/sda5 (/) is full - next step du -s /media/8e.../* to find the biggest directory there
2010-02-23T02:26:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	 I just wrote to Nitsuga before he said "continue with " me (see it?)
2010-02-23T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	yes I saw it - your home partition is not relevant - please type  du -s /media/8e.../* | sort -n to find the biggest directory there
2010-02-23T02:29:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	or are you within the real system now?
2010-02-23T02:30:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	heres `du -s /media/8.../* | sort -n ` : http://paste.ubuntu.com/381845/
2010-02-23T02:30:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	no, I'm doing these things via live cd
2010-02-23T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	now you see the biggest directory is var, next step du -s /media/8e.../var/* | sort -n to find the biggest one there
2010-02-23T02:32:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	is there a way to hide all the traffic in irssi (its not even content, its just "quit" "join" etc)? -- and okay, I'll dig down into var and see if I find anything
2010-02-23T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	I'm sure there is but I use xchat - so don't know
2010-02-23T02:38:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	:) thanks so much makes a big difference to have someone elses help when you're pannicking/stressed.
2010-02-23T02:39:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	I know the feeling :-) did you work it out by now?
2010-02-23T02:40:00.000Z	jonzbcc	guntbert	yes, it was a gigantic file being written to /var/backup (even though I _thought_  I unchecked that /var/backup feature).
2010-02-23T02:41:00.000Z	guntbert	jonzbcc	good :-))
