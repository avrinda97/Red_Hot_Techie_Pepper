2006-03-29T15:53:00.000Z	ludi		Hi I need help with an upgrade to dapper.
2006-03-29T15:53:00.000Z	ludi		when my system boots it hangs when loading the PCMCIA services
2006-03-29T15:53:00.000Z	dli	ludi	is it released?
2006-03-29T15:53:00.000Z	ludi	dli	no it's not released
2006-03-29T15:53:00.000Z	dli	ludi	don't load pcmcia then, remove it in kernel, and update-rc.d -f pcmcia remove
2006-03-29T15:54:00.000Z	ludi	dli	^
2006-03-29T15:54:00.000Z	dli	ludi	read ubuntu documents, you can boot ubuntu livecd
2006-03-29T15:56:00.000Z	ludi	dli	 how would I do that?  I have booted into debian which is on another hard drive in my system.  I can mount my ubuntu dapper hard drive from here.
2006-03-29T15:57:00.000Z	dli	ludi	go to /etc of the ubuntu partition, less inittab to find the default runlevel, (should be 2 by default), then, cd rc2.d, remove all filenames contains pcmcia
2006-03-29T15:58:00.000Z	ludi	dli	 like this?  ls -l *pcmcia*
2006-03-29T15:58:00.000Z	ludi	dli	when I run that command, I get nothing
2006-03-29T15:59:00.000Z	dli	ludi	or go to /etc/init.d/ (of ubuntu), mv pcmcia pcmcia.bak , a temporary work around
2006-03-29T16:00:00.000Z	dli	ludi	and cd /etc (of ubuntu), remove all pcmcia modules in /etc/modules
2006-03-29T16:01:00.000Z	ludi	dli	/etc/modules contains no pcmcia entries
2006-03-29T16:01:00.000Z	dli	ludi	or, you compile a kernel in debian without pcmcia
2006-03-29T16:01:00.000Z	dli	ludi	pcmcia doesn't necessarily be named pcmcia as modules
2006-03-29T16:01:00.000Z	ludi	dli	ide-cd
2006-03-29T16:02:00.000Z	ludi	dli	should I try it now?
2006-03-29T16:02:00.000Z	dli	ludi	to compile your own kernel is better
2006-03-29T16:02:00.000Z	ludi	dli	I have never compiled a kernel before
2006-03-29T16:02:00.000Z	ludi	dli	isn't that dangerous?
2006-03-29T16:03:00.000Z	dli	ludi	then, give it a try
2006-03-29T16:03:00.000Z	ludi	dli	but if what I've done already prevents pcmcia from loading and I can boot into dapper, then I shouldn't need to compile kernel right?
2006-03-29T16:03:00.000Z	dli	ludi	compiling your own kernel is better, but not necessary
