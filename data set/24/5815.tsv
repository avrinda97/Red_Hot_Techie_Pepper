2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	jrsims		hey, looks like I deleted my home directory and all my settings files for gnome.
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	jrsims		How do I create a new gnome profile
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	jrsims		?
2006-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	jrsims		Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
2006-06-01T07:41:00.000Z	jrsims		Hello!! Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
2006-06-01T07:42:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	Usually just logging in again will do it (after copying anything from /etc/skel to your new home)
2006-06-01T07:43:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	well, I will enter gnome from the login screen, but then all I get is a screen with my mouse pointer on it
2006-06-01T07:43:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	no menu bars or anything
2006-06-01T07:43:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	so I was thinking I probably killed all my gnome settings in the home directory.
2006-06-01T07:44:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	Did you lose your actual home directory?
2006-06-01T07:44:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	well, no. but everything in it is gone.
2006-06-01T07:45:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	including hidden stuff?
2006-06-01T07:45:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	yeah. I just did an "ls -a" though, and it looks like I have some of my settings files back. Still, gnome won't fully load.
2006-06-01T07:47:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	Hmmm. Are you really concerned with your settings (ie. customised to the extreme like me) because maybe deleting them and letting them be remade might work. However, it may not be a settings problem, it may be a  network/authentication one
2006-06-01T07:48:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	well, I'm not too worried about my settings, and it does look like many of the settings files were recreated when I attempted to log in again.
2006-06-01T07:48:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	I have encountered this before, but I forgot how I solved it. I think it was a permission thing
2006-06-01T07:48:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	so maybe it's not the fact that I killed my files, it's something else. I'm not sure what to do. Would an apt-get of gnome be an idea?
2006-06-01T07:49:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	I think removing your user and adding it again might work better as I think there are important files in your home for logging you into X
2006-06-01T07:49:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	ok. do you know the command? is it just a 'useradd'?
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	either that or adduser :)
2006-06-01T07:50:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	yeah, isn't there a difference - like you can add a user but it won't create a home dir, or something like that? Various adduser options?
2006-06-01T07:51:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	I honestly don't know (adduser seems fine whenever I use it)
2006-06-01T07:52:00.000Z	jrsims	Warbo	cool. I'll look at the man page and try that.
2006-06-28T11:46:00.000Z	Warbo	jrsims	add an "&" after it (so "firefox &")
