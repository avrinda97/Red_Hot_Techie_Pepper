2007-02-21T15:41:00.000Z	lisapc		is Norton Ghost the best way to create image files?
2007-02-21T15:41:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	I prefer Acronis True Image recovery disk
2007-02-21T15:43:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	is Acronis True Image the new Norton Ghost?
2007-02-21T15:43:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	no different product. TI has never failed me and I use it all the time. The "recovery cd" one can make from it from a Windoze install works beautifully to image Linux boxes, clone Linux drives, etc.
2007-02-21T15:44:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	using true image, does it backup even the boot sectors etc?
2007-02-21T15:44:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	yes
2007-02-21T15:45:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	it will even automatically create expanded partitions if you are restoring an image to a larger hard drive than it came from originally.
2007-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	no, not on the same CD. the image should be on another drive, like external USB, or another internal fixed drive or across a Windoze network.
2007-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	so u can create a boot CD with the created image on the same boot CD? and restore from there?
2007-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	no
2007-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	cant i create the image on a blank DVD?
2007-02-21T15:47:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	i dont have any spare partitions
2007-02-21T15:47:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	do you have a local network?
2007-02-21T15:47:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	its 13gig. too large for a usb stick
2007-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	no
2007-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	any ideas?
2007-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	you might consider getting an external USB hd ... pretty cheap these days and makes backing up a snap
2007-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	you are not helping
2007-02-21T15:49:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	notice my questinon carefully!  is there a way to create a image and restore it from a blank DVD?
2007-02-21T15:50:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	only if you have a DVD drive and another optical drive to run the recovery CD on
2007-02-21T15:50:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	but its too big for DVD anyway
2007-02-21T15:50:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	im going to install ubuntu and then only have that.  and use vista only for my tv tuner and video cam.
2007-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	lisapc	rbil	that way i dont need to restore it as it wont be using it much
2007-03-10T10:54:00.000Z	rbil	lisapc	if it's like vmplayer, simply deleting related vm files should get rid of a virtual machine. Unless there's some other way with the server version?
