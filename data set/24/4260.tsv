2007-05-26T16:45:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	eclipse + cdt is good but very slow compared to anjuta.
2007-05-26T16:46:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	what is the synaptic package name?
2007-05-26T16:46:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	what is the synaptic package name?
2007-05-26T16:47:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	eclipse I think, it runs on java. you can install the cdt from inside eclipse (updates). ubuntu installs gnu java implementations with eclipse though (dependencies) so I would recommend to jsut download eclipse from the official site and so on.
2007-05-26T16:47:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	thanks
2007-05-26T16:47:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	mind that eclipse is suboptimal for that anjuta is far nicer for C/C++
2007-05-26T16:48:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	you could also try kdevelop
2007-05-26T16:48:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	the only problem with anjuta is that whenever I compile a simple hello world program, it doesnt run
2007-05-26T16:49:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	how would I be able to run a program made by anjuta:
2007-05-26T16:49:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	did you manage to compile/run it yourself on the command line?
2007-05-26T16:56:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	after building the program, I saw the executable saved in my home directory, but when i double click it, nothing happens.
2007-05-26T16:56:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	it's just a simple hello world program from anjuta
2007-05-26T16:56:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	try running it from a console/terminal to see what error it gives
2007-05-26T16:57:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	there is no error
2007-05-26T16:57:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	it works fine in the terminal, printing "Hello World"
2007-05-26T16:58:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	how do I get it to run just by clicking it?
2007-05-26T16:58:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	probably you need to set "run in terminal" somewhere on it
2007-05-26T16:59:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	thx
2007-05-26T05:07:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	I can run the program in the terminal from anjuta, but not after it's been compiled.Do you happen to know how to set it to run from the terminal?
2007-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	predaeus	tux_wears_a_tux	nah, maybe you can right click on it and set it's properties, or create an application launcher that runs it and has run-in-terminal ticked
2007-05-26T05:14:00.000Z	tux_wears_a_tux	predaeus	how do i create a launcher?
