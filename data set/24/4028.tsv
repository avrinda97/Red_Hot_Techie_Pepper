2008-02-22T11:24:00.000Z	ritzcracker		I have tried the stable release and the alternitive cd
2008-02-22T11:25:00.000Z	ritzcracker		nithier work
2008-02-22T11:25:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	i think the last ppc version is 6.10 but i aint sure
2008-02-22T11:30:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	as i said, ppc isnt tsupported in latest. Try to install 6.10 and then try to uptade you way up to lateast supported version
2008-02-22T11:31:00.000Z	ritzcracker	judgen	ubuntu's website has released the lattest version of 7.10 for ubuntu, was this just the latest packes non tested? last stable tested version is 6.10?
2008-02-22T11:32:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	gimme a few sec, i have to check
2008-02-22T11:33:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/7.10/release/ubuntu-7.10-desktop-powerpc.iso did you use that one?
2008-02-22T11:33:00.000Z	ritzcracker	judgen	yes i did
2008-02-22T11:33:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	should work.. have you got any odd cards or upgrades in your machine'?
2008-02-22T11:34:00.000Z	ritzcracker	judgen	no it is all stock. it seems like for some reason it can not decide what video driver to use hence the screen being grey
2008-02-22T11:34:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	what gfx card are you using?
2008-02-22T11:35:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	have you tried installing in VESA mode?
2008-02-22T11:37:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	are you holding C while booting up?
2008-02-22T11:39:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	have you tried installing in terminal?
2008-02-22T11:40:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	if you use "live-nosplash-powerpc video=ofonly" at boot when using the minimal install cd you should be able to install. the problems seems to be with usplash
2008-02-22T11:42:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	gimme a little while and ill hunt it for you
2008-02-22T11:42:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	btw had you tried that options with the alternative cd?
2008-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/gutsy/main/installer-powerpc/current/images/powerpc/netboot/mini.iso
2008-02-22T11:44:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	try booting from that one
2008-02-22T11:45:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	then you can install ubuntu-desktop manually. thus skip that problem
2008-02-22T11:45:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	its an massive 8mb download =P
2008-02-22T11:53:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	darn.
2008-02-22T11:54:00.000Z	judgen	ritzcracker	as mini does not include any display drivers or usplash, im very preplexed about the outcome
