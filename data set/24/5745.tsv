2012-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	happy_		i tried everything unmounted it before formating etc
2012-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	are you running the install from this
2012-10-14T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	make it read/write
2012-10-14T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	how is it set read only ?
2012-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	/dev/sdb1 is a partition not a disk
2012-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	1.) is the file system currently mounted ?
2012-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	are you on the machine now ?
2012-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	please post the output of the following commands "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" and "mount"
2012-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	ok, so how can you partition /dev/sdb1 if /dev/sdb doesn't exist
2012-10-14T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	ok, so your disk device is not /dev/sdb as you thought
2012-10-14T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	please pastebin (not in the channel) the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
2012-10-14T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	yes
2012-10-14T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	please run the command I asked for
2012-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	I told you NOT to paste in the channel
2012-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	start reading and paying attention to what people are giving you
2012-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	you got kicked out because I kicked you out, because you are not doing what you are asked to do
2012-10-14T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	being new doesn't mean you can't follow instructions
2012-10-14T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	right, so say that
2012-10-14T13:09:00.000Z	ikonia	happy_	"I don't know how" rather than just do the opposite of what you've been asked to do
