2008-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	you just need flash.  visit http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/ and click on the yellow bar
2008-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	I already installed flash, but I am still getting the error message
2008-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	what does the page I gave you tell you?
2008-11-02T22:02:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	thanks, its working now
2009-11-09T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	##c++ is probably more appropriate or #bash
2009-11-09T06:32:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	I don't understand your reply.
2009-11-09T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	the irc channel ##c++ is probably more appropriate or the irc channel #bash
2009-11-09T06:33:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	ok, thanks
2011-01-30T21:41:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	yeah, you're missing a space...
2011-01-30T21:47:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	cousteau`nbk also told you that '0' should be 'o'.  If you still get the error, then the file doesn't exist in the directory you are in
2011-01-30T21:49:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	I do have an "o". the file is on a CD. How do i make that a part a path?
2011-01-30T21:49:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	what you pasted has a '0', not an 'o'
2011-01-30T21:49:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	I know, i typed it wrong
2011-01-30T21:50:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	for the path, start at / and provide the absolute path to the .iso
2011-01-30T21:50:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	how do i do that if the file is on a CD?
2011-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	/folder1/folder2/whateveryourfileiscalled  Probably /media/cdrom/.  If you know how to get there from the gui, then use that to aid you
2011-01-30T21:57:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	after putting my cd in, i see no indication where it is located, How would i find out its location?
2011-01-30T21:57:00.000Z	jrib	youngblood	check /media
2011-01-30T22:04:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	I found it, it was mounted on /media. thanks for your help
2011-01-30T22:11:00.000Z	youngblood	jrib	when I cd to /media and then do ls command, this is what I see - "Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS i386". This is nothing like the file created when I did the download. I would have assumed that the file name on the CD would be the same as the filename. Can I use the the file name i see from the ls command?
