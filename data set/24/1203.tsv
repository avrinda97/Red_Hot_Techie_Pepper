2010-05-19T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Get the ubuntu CD! !ubuntu
2010-05-19T08:22:00.000Z	dukefan02011	edbian	this is my only cpu and I want to dual boot it without messing it up,
2010-05-19T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Great: step 1 get an ubuntu cd and boot from it.
2010-05-19T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	We don't do tutorials from start to finish.  We more or less answer questions in a robust way.  http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2010-05-19T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	yes but it is harder.  You can use unetbootin
2010-05-19T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation#Installation%20without%20a%20CD   other ways to install ubuntu (I'm just using google here)
2010-05-19T08:28:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	I don't know why you'd want to install another way though.  It's more difficult
2010-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	No
2010-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	The CD will give you the option to install or to
2010-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	"try ubuntu" which will run the OS from the CD without any changes to your computer at all.
2010-05-19T08:32:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Yes  between a reboot of course
2010-05-19T08:33:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	But you can boot from the CD without affecting your computer at all.  It's very cool.  That's why the call it a live CD.
2010-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Get the CD and try it out! :)
2010-05-19T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	You're going to love linux :)
2010-05-19T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Yeah pretty much.  Sometimes you have to hold a button down on an older mac but I don't think that's true anymore.
2010-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	You need an ISO burner though cause it's an ISO file that you download
2010-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	Make sense?
2010-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	The site has pretty good instructions
2010-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	dukefan02011	:)
