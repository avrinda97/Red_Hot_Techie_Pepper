2008-08-13T18:23:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 usually grub rans finde, have you checked devices.map? I you run grub under chroot it's dificult.  test always wether (in grub cmd-line) find /boot/grub/menu.list is seen
2008-08-13T18:28:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	just tried it
2008-08-13T18:28:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 what was the problem?
2008-08-13T18:32:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	mount --bind /mnt/yournewinstallation/ boot /boot  so grub installs to your installation not to CD-Bootable.
2008-08-13T18:33:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	command doesn't work, and I replaced the yournewinstallation
2008-08-13T18:35:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 look at my wiki http://www.ddy.ch/pm/laden/pm.wiki/HW-Installation/GRUB1
2008-08-13T18:37:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	don't try with chroot, it very complicated that it works
2008-08-13T18:39:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	i've done the grub repair 4 times today
2008-08-13T18:39:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 I know sometimes it's tricky...
2008-08-13T18:48:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 is it the first time you install grub?
2008-08-13T18:48:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	nope,
2008-08-13T18:48:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	done this way too many times,
2008-08-13T18:49:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	sometimes it reacts very strange...
2008-08-13T18:49:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	today it's the strangest, none of my normal methods work, and none of google's methods have worked
2008-08-13T18:49:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	I made recently a few installations on usb-Drives and sticks, usually it works. On Drive did only work with grub2
2008-08-13T18:50:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#The%20GUI%20Way:%20Using%20the%20Alternate/Install%20CD%20and%20Overwriting%20the%20Windows%20bootloader
2008-08-13T18:51:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	but the trick to mount ---bind  did help me a lot.
2008-08-13T18:53:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 when I made a installation via chroot in /dev/sdc  . Grub wanted to install in /dev/scd8 (!).  sca8 was my real / and  sdc2 was the chroot.
2008-08-13T18:54:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	IMHO, when grub has problems with the stages, it looks at the wrong place.
2008-08-13T18:59:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	try grub2, but a very recent version...
2008-08-13T18:59:00.000Z	tonisius	pogay	not gonna try something new, i'm trying to get this older one to work, and more people know how to use it 'properly'
2008-08-13T19:00:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	 can you see the things via grub commandline  find /vmlinuz
2008-08-13T19:04:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	I had the case, where grub recognised the geometry but couldn't access the files..http://www.ddy.ch/pm/laden/pm.wiki/ProdTest/GRUB..
2008-08-13T19:07:00.000Z	pogay	tonisius	o.k
