2009-12-01T13:08:00.000Z	Balsaq		get rid of all the cache, history and useless pieces of files left over from uninstalls
2009-12-01T13:08:00.000Z	Balsaq		ok sudo apt-get clean...that will do it?
2009-12-01T13:09:00.000Z	Balsaq		thats it?
2009-12-01T13:09:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	.deb files are like Setup.exe...it gets rid of those
2009-12-01T13:01:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	purge your ubuntu? install root?
2009-12-01T13:01:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	root is a user, not something to install...
2009-12-01T13:06:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	when anyone tries to attack your computer, they know to try username root and then only try to guess password to break in and have free run of everything
2009-12-01T13:06:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	theyd need to guess both your username AND your password with the default setup
2009-12-01T13:07:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	this makes it an exponentially more difficult problem
2009-12-01T13:09:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	itll empty out /var/cache/apt/archives
2009-12-01T13:09:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	if you do "sudo aptitude purge PACKAGE" itll uninstall *and* remove systemwide config files for PACKAGE
2010-11-01T08:38:00.000Z	Balsaq	maco	the nwut is wubi all about?
2010-11-01T08:39:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	it actually was started as a 3rd party thing and then integrated into the CD
2010-11-01T08:39:00.000Z	Balsaq	maco	i think it is good software and it insalled beautifully into my new laptop and has performed flawlessly so far...
2010-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	Balsaq	maco	i would like to see you change the stock ubuntu colors from taupe...to fire engine red.
2010-11-01T08:41:00.000Z	maco	Balsaq	aubergine is the colour, not taupe, and i'm neither a designer nor ubuntu-desktop person. i'm involved in kubuntu-desktop, and the kubuntu community has agreed to stick to kde artwork
2010-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	Balsaq	maco	the stock ubuntu color theme look surprisingly like baby's kuku
