2011-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	mosx1		hi all, I am having some installation problems with 11.04 32bit downloaded ISO
2011-07-07T19:53:00.000Z	mosx1		I have burnt to CD-R but when I try to boot from CD I get a message up on screen
2011-07-07T19:53:00.000Z	martian	mosx1	What does the message say?
2011-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	mosx1		cannot mount /dev/loop0
2011-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	mosx1		sorry was attempting to copy paste...
2011-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	mosx1		cannot mount /dev/loop0
2011-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	mosx1		(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: input/output error.
2011-07-07T19:55:00.000Z	mosx1		Can not mount /dev/loop0 (cdrom/casperfilesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs
2011-07-07T19:55:00.000Z	mosx1		nope...I never do
2011-07-07T19:55:00.000Z	martian	mosx1	based on this thread, I'm wondering if your iso download failed: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1556602
2011-07-07T19:55:00.000Z	mosx1		but I sure checked it afterwards and it was ok
2011-07-07T19:57:00.000Z	mosx1	martian	so I've checked the ISOs md5 and it was good
2011-07-07T19:57:00.000Z	mosx1		I used ImgBurn latest version to burn the ISO
2011-07-07T19:57:00.000Z	martian	mosx1	well, regardless of the cause, it seems that many install problems like this are fixed by using the alternate install cd
2011-07-07T19:58:00.000Z	mosx1		718,583,808 bytes
2011-07-07T19:59:00.000Z	mosx1		I have something else going on that I thought was a bit odd though...
2011-07-07T19:59:00.000Z	mosx1		when I boot from the cd I get the Ubuntu logo up for a while before the message...
2011-07-07T20:00:00.000Z	mosx1		when I tried it on another machine I got a diff logo...in fact it said Ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-07T20:00:00.000Z	mosx1		I burnt a CD have no DVD media
2011-07-07T20:00:00.000Z	martian	mosx1	You should try the alternate install iso
2011-07-07T20:00:00.000Z	mosx1		the machine I am trying to install on had 9.04 but it failed to reboot
2011-07-07T20:01:00.000Z	mosx1		yeah i read a few threads that suggested that
2011-07-07T20:01:00.000Z	mosx1		didn't make much sense to me why that could be the case - any suggestions ?
2011-07-07T20:01:00.000Z	martian	mosx1	yes, use the alternate install cd
