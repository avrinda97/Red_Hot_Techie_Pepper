2009-03-20T04:20:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	hello
2009-03-20T04:30:00.000Z	cipherZen	Krell	precisely, you can get libdvdcss from the mediabuntu repositories
2009-03-20T04:31:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	i have installed the "forbidden" drivers pack and on the sights that talk about it have install links on the page and tell me that they are all installed already that is what has me confused
2009-03-20T04:33:00.000Z	cipherZen	Krell	sent you a PM, we can continue on there
2009-03-21T02:45:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	hello again
2009-03-21T02:48:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	oh hey thought you were afk or something :) you have time for me to pick your brain today?
2009-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	ok here goes .... i can play DVD movies with VLC and Totem... by using the interlace i can make the quality ok.  the problem comes from trying to use other movie players they say i don't have libdvdcss.
2009-03-21T02:58:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	umm totem and VLC work, mplayer, kaffeine, qxine do not
2009-03-21T03:00:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	strangely kaffeine says it's encoded and needs libdvdcss, and i have all that installed for some reason it will not see it. the others say something like stream not handled or don't have plug in
2009-03-21T03:02:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	all i seem to find in a google search is about installing the restricted drivers :/ and i have done most all of them they now all tell me that is it already installed
2009-03-21T03:07:00.000Z	cipherZen	Krell	Kaffeine uses totem correct?
2009-03-21T03:08:00.000Z	Krell	cipherZen	i don't know how can i check?
2009-03-21T03:09:00.000Z	cipherZen	Krell	try the last thing on this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=515067
