2010-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Avoid deleting anything until you know that's the problem just rename it.
2010-07-04T14:41:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Is firefox ok on sites that don't have flash content?
2010-07-04T14:42:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	www.google.co.uk
2010-07-04T14:43:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Can you disable the shockwave flash plugin and try the sites that were causing you to crash before.
2010-07-04T14:44:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	It may be problematic with your older version of Ubuntu.
2010-07-04T14:47:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Did you mean to say "without"?
2010-07-04T14:47:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Sorry ignore that just read an old post my bad
2010-07-04T14:49:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Tools > Addons > Plugins
2010-07-04T14:53:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	I'm not sure if it's a problem but I've only got the one entry myself.
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	How did you install flash in the first place?
2010-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	www.youtube.com
2010-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Can you remember exactly which package you installed?
2010-07-04T14:57:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	That sounds about right I'm just not sure what the movie player plugin you had is or where it came from.
2010-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	eoke	Taev	Did you say you were on Ubuntu 8.10
