2008-05-29T23:33:00.000Z	jessika		doesn't look like anything there applies. the nvidia driver isn't loading
2008-05-29T23:33:00.000Z	jessika		although it says it is in the hardware manager
2008-05-29T23:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	any output from glxinfo ?
2008-05-29T23:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	looks like a mis-configured /etc/X11/xorg.conf, hardy has a newer xorg and things have changed a bit .. could you pastebin that xorg.conf please ?
2008-05-29T23:43:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	do you have nvidia-settings package installed ?
2008-05-29T23:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	 did you try the envyng-gtk drivers ?
2008-05-29T23:47:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	well, i can't state that it's bullet-proof, but couldn't hurt to re-install and see what gives i suppose, since your system is crippled as it is right now .. re-installing that solved my xorg problems though, running smoothly ever since
2008-05-29T23:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	hehe, yep, take the necessary backup precautions .. and use xorg-edit package to "test-drive" before committing ;)
2008-05-29T23:50:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	any guidance from the /var/log/Xorg.0.log btw ?
2008-05-29T23:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	ok great, i'll look and report back
2008-05-29T23:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	looks clean allright ... one of those harder nuts to crack it seems
2008-05-29T23:59:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	yep, the display 0.0 bit is the only thing to go on i suppose, weird
2008-05-30T00:00:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	no it's a syntax thing that double O notation
2008-05-30T00:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	i'm gonna take a precise look at my xorg.conf, back in a sec, just want to check something display-settings wise
2008-05-30T00:03:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	what is the busid in your xorg.conf for the device section ?
2008-05-30T00:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	that could be a problem .. i'll add something to your pastebin okay, it's worth a shot
2008-05-30T00:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	added a one-liner, line 88
2008-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	that sound be the same sequence of numbers as generated by the output of 'lspci'
2008-05-30T00:12:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	*should, sound is working i hop ;)
2008-05-30T00:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	too bad .. annoying
2008-05-30T00:29:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	that is a tough one indeed .. although I didn't catch any mode lines in your xorg.conf neither ... taking a second look as we type ..
2008-05-30T00:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	are you running a twinview xinerama set-up as your xorg.conf suggests ?
2008-05-30T00:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	the only thing i can come up with is the somewhat unfamiliar *0 "Screen0" 0 0* bit on line 3, anyone around that can translate that into human speak for jessika ?
2008-05-30T00:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	jessika	: never used a twinview setup like yours .. maybe someone who has can assist you
