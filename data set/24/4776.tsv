2010-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	mememe		ok. followed the link. all that information is for installations previous to mine. i started, today, with installing from a supplied live ubuntu 9.10 (karmic) cd, then running the live upgrade install. that site says everything from earlier than 9.04 needs an upgrade, but 9.10 and newer should already have grub2

2010-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	mememe		wow. that's still me, but i guess it wasn't that one i was using all this time in irc
2010-05-27T05:09:00.000Z	mememe		think you guys missed this so posting it again: > ok. followed the link. all that information is for installations previous to mine. i started, today, with installing from a supplied live ubuntu 9.10 (karmic) cd, then running the live upgrade install. that site says everything from earlier than 9.04 needs an upgrade, but 9.10 and newer should already have grub2
2010-05-27T05:15:00.000Z	mememe		ok while i wait for an answer on how to fix/install grub2, i have other questions. like how to connect my network drives on my local area network?
2010-05-27T05:15:00.000Z	mememe		or, if i am ultimately unable to fix my windows installation, how to increase the size of my ubuntu partition?
2010-05-27T05:16:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i get "bash: !grub2: event not found
2010-05-27T05:18:00.000Z	mememe		deofavente: thank you for that. actually, before someone offers to answer your question, my guess is you have to just ask the room
2010-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i went to the site provided it says grub2 should have been installed with my ubuntu installation,w hich it wasn't. so i'm at a loss.
2010-05-27T05:20:00.000Z	mememe		ok i must have been given multiple pages. the page i went to talked about 9.10 and newer having grub2, and oler versions like jaunty needing to update.
2010-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	mememe		honestly, i'm not lying or refusing to follow instructions. I'm just a freaking n00b doing this less than one day. could you guys please have at least a little patience with me?
2010-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	mememe		when someone types "!grub2" what dos that mean, in english, that i am supposed to do?
2010-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	mememe		ok, so if so, then why did i get a bash error, and why when i got that and reported it here, did i get told "no one told you to type that"?
2010-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	i am sorry if i mistook that link as the same one someone had just given me and did not read it for what i thought would be a useless "second" time. please have some patience with me
2010-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	mememe		someone in this room told me that, ikonia
2010-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	mememe		then you told me no one had.
2010-05-27T05:25:00.000Z	mememe	ikonia	someone did. i'm sorry if you missed it. and, again, i am SORRY i didn't follow the wiki link which i am now reading. thankyouverymuch
2010-05-27T05:25:00.000Z	mememe		for the record, this is the link i thought the ubottu sent me a second time, where it does say what i said it says: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
2010-05-27T05:27:00.000Z	mememe		actually, it was you who did. here it is: ikonia> !grub2 > mememe
2010-05-27T05:27:00.000Z	mememe		ok. call me an idiot. what does that mean, "!grub 2 ? mememe
2010-05-27T05:27:00.000Z	mememe		excuse em "!grub2 > mememe"
2010-05-27T05:28:00.000Z	mememe		what should i have interpreted that to mean?
2010-05-27T05:28:00.000Z	mememe		i'm sorry i'm so confused. like i said, this is my first day with any of this.
2010-05-27T05:29:00.000Z	Pici	mememe	its okay, sometimes this can all be a bit overwhelming.
