2005-08-09T12:15:00.000Z	lui		hello everybody
2005-08-09T12:15:00.000Z	lui		i am so, so, so happy with this ubuntu i can't take it!! :)
2005-08-09T12:17:00.000Z	lui		i've just installed an hour ago and i'm trying it but it is practically perfect
2005-08-09T12:17:00.000Z	gpd	lui	 are you a linux person? if so which previous distro?
2005-08-09T12:19:00.000Z	gpd	lui	good luck!
2005-08-09T12:26:00.000Z	lui	gpd	I have bought a basic linux book to enter this world and I am learning very well. The thing is it have nothing in common with windows, you know? For a person like me who started with such a bad thing this linux world is a whole new world
2005-08-09T12:27:00.000Z	gpd	lui	that is half the attraction for some ;)
2005-08-09T12:27:00.000Z	gpd	lui	 kde is slightly more like windows... but not much
2005-08-09T12:29:00.000Z	lui	gpd	yep, i've tried with SuSE, but then, when I saw gnome interface I liked more, I'm tired of things like windows, you know?
2005-08-09T12:30:00.000Z	gpd	lui	yes! I know too well ;)
2005-08-09T12:33:00.000Z	lui	gpd	one thing I have asked to some friend, some linux friends, is why linux looks so cool, so smooth, everything looks so well like machitosh. For me is a dream come true because windows is so ugly I can't take it anymore. So why the fots and the graphics look so well in linux and windows look so "hard"?
2005-08-09T12:34:00.000Z	gpd	lui	that is an unusual response!  windows fonts are pretty amazing with cleartype...
2005-08-09T12:35:00.000Z	lui	gpd	yes man, of course but it doesn't compare with linux, the windows cleartype can't do it so good
2005-08-09T12:36:00.000Z	gpd	lui	glad you are pleased :)
2005-08-12T12:41:00.000Z	lui	gpd	the v or the vi?
2005-08-12T12:42:00.000Z	gpd	lui	graphical front ent to sysv-rc-conf
2005-08-12T12:43:00.000Z	lui	gpd	oops, i dn't know
2005-08-12T12:43:00.000Z	lui	gpd	oops, i don't know
2005-08-12T12:43:00.000Z	gpd	lui	it should be in gnome-utils but not there
2005-08-12T12:51:00.000Z	lui	gpd	try /usr/share/sysvinit
2005-08-12T12:52:00.000Z	gpd	lui	I used sysv-rc-conf - it was all good, sysvconfig is broke though
2005-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	lui	gpd	I don't see any sysv-rc-conf
2005-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	gpd	lui	you have to apt-get it :)
2005-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	lui	gpd	that's why I don't see any :)
