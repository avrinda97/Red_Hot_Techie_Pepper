2009-04-16T22:49:00.000Z	mbeierl		heya, does anyone know how to get the source code for a package?
2009-04-16T22:49:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	If you have the deb-src lines for the repository, use apt-get source packagename
2009-04-16T22:49:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	thanks!  apt-get source!  whoulda thunk?
2009-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	You don't need sudo for that either, it will download the files to the current directory.
2009-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	thanks, I just tried it w/o sudo and am glad to see that it did what I expected
2009-04-16T22:51:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	any clue on building packages then?  like if I want to test something out?
2009-04-16T22:51:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	sorry - duh! it was just a ./configure
2009-04-16T22:51:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide
2009-08-18T23:32:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	banned him...
2009-10-06T19:44:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	install apt-file, run sudo apt-file update then: apt-file search libtermcap.so.2
2009-10-06T19:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	jrlb: thanks!
2009-11-10T22:13:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	isn't dist-upgrade now called full-upgrade?
2009-11-10T22:14:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	Only in aptitude
2009-11-10T22:14:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	ah, ok.  thanks!
2009-11-10T22:14:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	And aptitude is a bit more forgiving when it comes to packages that depend on new packages now. But the remove stuff is the same.  Its manpage has more details.
2009-11-11T20:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	DefamedPrawn: does that need to be done for each mounted filesystem, for /boot (if it's separate) or just for / ?
2009-11-11T20:37:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	I *think* it just needs to be done on / , but I'm not 100% sure on that.
2010-04-22T20:42:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	10.04 is not released, merely the release candidate, please use #ubuntu+1 for discussion
2010-04-23T00:41:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	I don't see any packages in our archives that provide that file.... I'd check your auth log.
2010-09-09T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	Its no longer supported upstream, was removed from debian and then us: see http://bugs.debian.org/521175
2010-09-15T18:49:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	You aren't identified either.
2010-09-15T18:50:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	how is it that I am not identified?  I've got a registered nick and set it up in pidgin to sign me in?
2011-12-01T06:28:00.000Z	Pici	mbeierl	ubottu.com is having issues. thus no ubottu, and why the floodbots are flopping around
2011-12-01T06:28:00.000Z	mbeierl	Pici	i was wondering about the floodbots...
