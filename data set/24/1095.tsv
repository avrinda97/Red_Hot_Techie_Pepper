2011-05-16T00:50:00.000Z	pfifo	madstein	are you mounting /dev/pts?
2011-05-16T00:50:00.000Z	madstein		i dont think so
2011-05-16T00:51:00.000Z	pfifo	madstein	there is an opting in the kernel for ttys Im assuming its enabled, as thats its default state. However you may not have a console enabled or a frambuffer.
2011-05-16T00:52:00.000Z	madstein	pfifo	help me out then i used the oold config
2011-05-16T00:52:00.000Z	pfifo	madstein	well check to make sure those are enabled
2011-05-16T00:52:00.000Z	madstein		how ?
2011-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	pfifo	madstein	well first, why are you using a custom kernel?
2011-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	madstein		atheros not working right with the generic kernel
2011-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	madstein		the new one fixed it
2011-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	pfifo	madstein	are you sure ubuntu doesnt provide a newer kernel with the fix?
