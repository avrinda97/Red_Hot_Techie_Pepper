2006-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	whalesalad		tristianbob: unless its a mac, the best way to go is newegg
2006-12-03T10:15:00.000Z	whalesalad		im following thsi guide for the mysql portion, http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p4
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		mysqladmin -u root password yourrootsqlpassword    <- is the command that gives me errors
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		im already root right now
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		root@wsdev:/home/whalesalad# mysqladmin -u root password *******
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
2006-12-03T10:18:00.000Z	whalesalad		i think it might be a hostname issue
2006-12-03T10:20:00.000Z	whalesalad		i guess what the problem is, is that im trying to connect to the databse server from my macbook using an app called navacat, when i try and connect it tells me that the host (my macbook) is not allowed to connect to the mysql server
2006-12-03T10:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	Just add access; grant all on db.* to user@remotehostname identified by 'password';
2006-12-03T10:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	and then 'flush privileges;'
2006-12-03T10:21:00.000Z	whalesalad	cafuego_	sorry. im an sql noob, how do I do that?
2006-12-03T10:22:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	'sudo mysql', then run those commands
2006-12-03T10:22:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	actually, just 'mysql -u root' and not sudo at all
2006-12-03T10:22:00.000Z	whalesalad		ok well its giving me that password error, so how do I login with the password in the terminal
2006-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	whalesalad		-p and the password doesnt work
2006-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	whalesalad		ok nevermind, i figured it out
2006-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	did you set a root password for mysql?
2006-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	whalesalad		haha sorry, its been a while and i keep not trying what i already know thinking it wot work
2006-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	whalesalad		yeah, so now im on the command line. how can I grant access to my macbook, so i guess systems other than localhost
2006-12-03T10:25:00.000Z	cafuego_		don't believe fierljeppen
2006-12-03T10:25:00.000Z	whalesalad		cafuego: how can I tell mysql that anyoen from the ip ______ is allowed
2006-12-03T10:25:00.000Z	cafuego_	whalesalad	%@remotehost
