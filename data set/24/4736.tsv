2007-12-06T08:37:00.000Z	FluxD		audacity I think f0rtune
2007-12-06T08:38:00.000Z	FluxD		it converts to mp3 using lame library
2007-12-06T08:39:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	I don't know what can do the wmv reading, but definitely just bash + lame will handle massive scale conversion
2007-12-06T08:40:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	no clue :/
2007-12-06T08:42:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	from some googling looks like mplayer can output a wav file from anything it can play, then you can lame encode it
2007-12-06T08:42:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	oh nice
2007-12-12T05:58:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	updatedb and locate :) in the terminal
2007-12-12T05:59:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	should just be able to do "locate <search-string>" and find files
2007-12-12T05:59:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	it can find stuff from the whole computer?
2007-12-12T05:59:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	just searching filenames and dir names, yes
2007-12-12T06:03:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	yes, it's run daily by default (the slocate file in /etc/cron.daily)
2007-12-12T06:03:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	"sudo updatedb"
2007-12-12T06:04:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	you can use it to create you're own databases if you want, but with no arguments it tries to update the system database, hence you need sudo
2007-12-12T06:04:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	sudo locate after that?
2007-12-12T06:04:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	you can locate without sudo
2007-12-12T06:05:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	"locate <search> | grep mp3"
2007-12-12T06:05:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	hence the power of using the command line
2007-12-12T06:05:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	nice :)
2007-12-12T06:07:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	find does the searching slowly, but allows you to search by almost ANYTHING relating to files (by owners / permissions / mod or create time / etc)
2007-12-12T06:07:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	I mean find the command
2007-12-12T06:08:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	Jordan_U: I have a file called "Angel City - Do You  .mp3" I did "locate angel city | grep mp3" and it didnt find it
2007-12-12T06:08:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	FluxD "locate -i angel city"
2007-12-12T06:08:00.000Z	FluxD	kelsin	Jordan_U thx
2007-12-12T06:09:00.000Z	kelsin	FluxD	"man locate" for more options
