2008-05-08T00:46:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mimi	USB stuff normally will mount if it is plugged-in after you log in ...
2008-05-08T00:47:00.000Z	Mimi	Don_Miguel	dholbert:   I'm aware of that *sigh* but the reason Im asking here, is BECAUSE it is NOT mounting, so I figured "Hey, to make it mount, I can put it on fstab!" But I don't want to have to sudo mount  every time I log in! Is there a way around that?! It's ALL I'm asking!
2008-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	Don_Miguel	Mimi	<Mimi> ejer: /dev/sdb1 /media/USB\040Drive ntfs-3g defaults 0 0  I think ejer is probably correct about your backslash in the name ... and that may indeed be the "Problem" ...
2008-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	Mimi	Don_Miguel	 the backslash is just an escape character for a space >.> I already said it mounts fine from command line .. thanks anyway
