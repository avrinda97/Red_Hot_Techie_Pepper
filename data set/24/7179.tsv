2005-05-14T14:50:00.000Z	Keizer		Damn
2005-05-14T14:50:00.000Z	Keizer		Totem is bringing my system doooooown
2005-05-14T14:51:00.000Z	Keizer		I should be able to play DVDs with a 1.6Ghz and 256MB of RAM
2005-05-14T14:51:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Keizer	I play dvds with a 800mhz 512mb
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer	Fator_Dee	Twice my RAM
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer	Fator_Dee	How long does it take to load a DVD movie?
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer		Mine is still spinning
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Keizer	haven't measured
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer		OMG
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer		< 5 minutes?
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		you have dma on?
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer		Maybe
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		check
2005-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	Keizer		I'll check
2005-05-14T14:53:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		and yes, <5min
2005-05-14T14:54:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Keizer	and you have installed the library to decode dvds?
2005-05-14T14:55:00.000Z	Keizer	Fator_Dee	I have all that
2005-05-14T14:56:00.000Z	Keizer	Fator_Dee	Get this, everything in my hdparm.conf is commented out....
2005-05-14T14:56:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	Keizer	what does "hdparm /dev/hdX" say
2005-05-14T14:56:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		where hdX is your dvd-player
2005-05-14T14:57:00.000Z	Keizer		sudo /sbin/hdparm -d 1 /dev/cdrom
2005-05-14T14:57:00.000Z	Keizer		That enables DMA
2005-05-14T14:58:00.000Z	Fator_Dee		it's -d1
2005-05-14T14:59:00.000Z	Keizer	Fator_Dee	I'll have to try Totem because MPlayer just shit itself when I tried to get it to play the DVD
