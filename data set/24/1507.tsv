2009-12-26T07:39:00.000Z	cslamar		hello, I'm trying to setup dual monitors under ubuntu.  Everything this working except when i move my mouse to the second monitor i cannot move it back to the first monitor.  Any ideas?
2009-12-26T07:40:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	ubuntu verision? video card type ? video card drivers (where you got them from) ?
2009-12-26T07:42:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	9.10amd64, Quadro FX 2700M, nvidia 195 beta driver (i've tried the stable one as well) and got from nvidia's site
2009-12-26T07:43:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	ok i assume you are using the nvidia control panel >?
2009-12-26T07:43:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	i've used it and have hand edited xorg.conf as well
2009-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	you shouldn't need to touch xorg. but describe how you attempted to setup the dual screen with the control panel
2009-12-26T07:46:00.000Z	cslamar		well the reason i had to hand edit it was because the second screen i'm using is a vertical monitor attached to a laptop, and TwinView won't let you rotate a single monitor
2009-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	cslamar		i enabled Xinerama and configured the resolutions of both monitors and then added the rotate option to xorg.conf so it would be the proper direction
2009-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	so then you are using two separate x sessions per screen ?
2009-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	ok xinerama not 2 x sessions.
2009-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	yea
2009-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	cslamar		everything works fine except that when i move the mouse over to the second screen it won't move back to the first monitor
2009-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	and this gets both screens working and the vertical one rotated? (but you cant treat them like one coherent display)
2009-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	I can one way.  I can move windows to the second monitor but cannot move them back to the first
2009-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	ah ok one thing i can think of is that the way multi screens work in twinview and xinerama is that the mouse leave s one screen via a porthole and enters the next screen through any of its sides (not a porthole)... maybe the destination screen porthole is not where you expect it to be (on the adjacent side of you first monitor)
2009-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	so perhaps try to move the cursor past all eges of the second screen.
2009-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	tried that
2009-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	yes it was too easy to be the solution.
2009-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	did you by chance read/find this : http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Ubuntu/2008-10/msg01251.html
2009-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	the really weird part is that i can move the windows back and forth but not the mouse
2009-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	mouse refuses to leave 2nd monitor ?
2009-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	cslamar		yup
2009-12-26T07:55:00.000Z	airtonix	cslamar	that link i posted previously seems to be exactly your situation..no ?
2009-12-26T07:55:00.000Z	cslamar	airtonix	reading now
