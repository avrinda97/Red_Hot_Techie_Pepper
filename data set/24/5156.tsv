2007-06-30T13:47:00.000Z	tony_		not just "All linux commands have to start with "sudo"  I don't know why.
2007-06-30T13:47:00.000Z	tony_		you know?
2007-06-30T13:49:00.000Z	tony_		ok ivan click System, then About and look around for a version number
2007-06-30T13:51:00.000Z	tony_		no, ivan_: it'll be a year, then month number... either 6.10 or 7.04 probably
2007-06-30T13:51:00.000Z	tony_		and it'll say "Edgy Eft" or "Feisty Fawn"
2007-06-30T13:52:00.000Z	tony_		on mine it does ompaul
2007-06-30T13:52:00.000Z	tony_		"Thank you for your interest in Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft"
2007-06-30T13:52:00.000Z	tony_		anywho ivan you're in luck because you have Feisty
2007-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	tony_		go to System > Administration > Restricted ____ (I forget what the actual name is, cause I don't use Feisty on this machine) but something about restricted)
2007-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	tony_		it makes it easier for you to install your codecs
2007-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	yell8w	tony_	restricted drivers manager
2007-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	tony_		thanks yell8w
2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	tony_	yell8w	that's where the codecs are handled, right?
2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	tony_		I haven't used that feature of Feisty yet
2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	tony_		still running Edgy here LOL
2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	yell8w	tony_	no, that's where you get your ati drivers
2007-06-30T13:54:00.000Z	tony_		gotcha...
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	tony_		so how do the codecs come up... I know they come up automagically when you do something...
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	tony_		does he just need to try to play a divx video?
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	yell8w	tony_	as far as codecs there are gstreamers, or w32codecs + libcsssomething
2007-06-30T13:55:00.000Z	tony_		yeah but how do you trigger the auto-download thing that I saw advertised so much about Feisty?
2007-06-30T13:56:00.000Z	tony_		ok ivan_ do you know how to install stuff with synaptic yet?
2007-06-30T13:56:00.000Z	yell8w	tony_	erhh just try to open a file ?
2007-06-30T13:56:00.000Z	tony_	yell8w	that's what I thought... might work
