2005-12-02T08:31:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	I think so, but totally different genre of music then System Of A Down
2005-12-02T08:31:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	in the same genre of System of  A Down, I know the new Mudvayne and Demon Hunter cds are pretty sweet
2005-12-02T08:35:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	ok..bak to blogging the nvidia drivers...
2005-12-02T08:35:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	i haven't forgotten, but had a problem with eclipse...just fixed it now
2005-12-02T08:37:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	ok... i will ask you to review my blog...to make sure it's accurate...since you'll have recent experiecne by then =) (that is if you're around and don't mind)
2005-12-02T08:40:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	doesn't that have to do with the ZAxisMapping stuff in the xorg.conf ?
2005-12-02T08:41:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	open a terminal and run, "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2005-12-02T08:42:00.000Z	tyrelsouza	zdennis	ok i will try
2005-12-02T08:42:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	then do a Ctrl-F and search for ZAxis
2005-12-02T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	in a terminal, do "cd /etc/X11"
2005-12-02T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	then do a "ls"  and let me know if you see a xorg.conf file in there
2005-12-02T08:45:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	it probably says "4 5"   , correct?
2005-12-02T08:46:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	switch them to "5 4"
2005-12-02T08:46:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	yep and  then you need to restart X, by hitting Ctrl-Alt-Backspace ...and then relogin
2005-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	Ctrl-Alt-Backspace actually kills X, but default ubuntu installs will automatically restart the things for you
2005-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	i agree with polpak. wait until they're done. You can save it whenever
2005-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	zdennis	tyrelsouza	whenever you're name is mentioend, XChat highlights the line in red
2005-12-02T08:48:00.000Z	tyrelsouza	zdennis	so this is red to you?
