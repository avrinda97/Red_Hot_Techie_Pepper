2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z	porkpie		guy's I am having problems setting JAVA_HOME  can anyone help please run.sh: Missing file: /lib/tools.jar
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z	porkpie		run.sh: Unexpected results may occur.  Make sure JAVA_HOME points to a JDK and not a JRE.
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z	porkpie		I am not sure how to set JAVA_HOME
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	its complining the a jar in /lib is missing
2007-11-30T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	JAVA_HOME=$PATH/TO/SOMEWHERE
2007-11-30T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	I've just shown you "JAVA_HOME=$PATH-you-WANT"
2007-11-30T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	if thats your path, yes
2007-11-30T15:36:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	that looks an unusual path
2007-11-30T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	thats because yout path is not right
2007-11-30T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	its not - you are. You're setting the wrong path
2007-11-30T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	your setting the wrong path
2007-11-30T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	thats not what java_home is for
2008-01-02T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	your building perl
2008-01-02T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	the static libary is not portable
2008-01-02T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	few things look odd there, like the libraries path on /usr/local/lib that seems odd, and it's trylink to use a staic lib as a dso
2008-01-02T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	I'd have to look into that in detail as you've not given me much to go on, but I suggest you get support from teh freeradius guys
2008-01-02T20:27:00.000Z	ikonia	porkpie	no a clue, take a look
