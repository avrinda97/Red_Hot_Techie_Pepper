2011-11-17T16:02:00.000Z	New0		is there a way to install ubuntu with NTFS?
2011-11-17T16:03:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	Do you mean install ubuntu on an NTFS filesystem?
2011-11-17T16:03:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	yes on NTFS FileSystem
2011-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	I'd go with dr_willis, look at the WUBI install option
2011-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	no tnx. hate WUBI
2011-11-17T16:05:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	If you install Ubuntu on ext4, ubuntu will be able to mount NTFS partitions
2011-11-17T16:06:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	right, so all i have to do is. sda1 (ext4) sda2 (ntfs)?
2011-11-17T16:07:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	yes?
2011-11-17T16:08:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	Probably the otherway round, install Windows(sda1) leaving space for Ubuntu (sda2(/),sda3(swap))
2011-11-17T16:10:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	well i brother doesn't want any windows on it. (Win or Lin) so only ubuntu will be install on it. but he want to be able to cpy /pst from/to windows (pc1) ubuntu (pc2)
2011-11-17T16:10:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	You don't need an NTFS partition on Linux
2011-11-17T16:15:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	samba or ssh
2011-11-17T16:16:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	ok tnx for all of your help. i will do that. and btw how much ext4 space for OS? GB
2011-11-17T16:17:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	Ubuntu Server can fit in 4Gb.
2011-11-17T16:18:00.000Z	New0	deej1976	so 10GB for / OS is good?
2011-11-17T16:18:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	/ (sda1-10Gb), swap (sda2-2Gb), /home (sda3-rest)
2011-11-17T16:22:00.000Z	deej1976	New0	yes
