2010-07-28T08:30:00.000Z	therealpsychx	sixofour	So you press the mouse lock, then can't get out of it - or do anything at all? Then you hold the power button on the laptop?
2010-07-28T08:30:00.000Z	sixofour	therealpsychx	pressing mouse lock pretty much breaks linux

2010-07-28T08:42:00.000Z	therealpsychx	sixofour	Something you can try is going to System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager, then search for something called: gpointing-device-settings

2010-07-28T08:42:00.000Z	therealpsychx	sixofour	It basically gives you more control over the settings for the touchpad.
2010-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	therealpsychx	sixofour	Also, check out this Ubuntuforums post.. I'll PM it to you.
