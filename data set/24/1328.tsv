2010-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot		every time I try to install GRUB bootloader (on the alt install CD) it says "UNABLE TO INSTALL GRUB IN (ha0,#). EXECUTING 'grub-install (ha0,#) FAILED. THIS IS A FATAL ERROR. Where # is the sda number of the boot partition. What did I do wrong anyone???
2010-03-09T18:47:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	LLUTZ in lowercase.
2010-03-09T18:50:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	We're all volunteers here. Treat llutz with more kindness, he's trying to help you.
2010-03-09T18:51:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	then possibly clarify. Drop the issue now, llutz has no interest in helping you. Ask the question again in a little while, or rephrase it to be clearer.
2010-03-09T18:52:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	ha0?
2010-03-09T18:52:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	specifically ha0?
2010-03-09T18:53:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	you're doin' it wrong. try hda1
2010-03-09T18:55:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	is it a sata drive?
2010-03-09T18:55:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	im assuming, yes
2010-03-09T18:55:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	is this a laptop?
2010-03-09T18:56:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	yes
2010-03-09T19:09:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	reinstall with the livecd.
2010-03-09T19:08:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	i can't use the live CD because im installing a fully encrypted dualboot system
2010-03-09T19:09:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	do you have any other suggestions?
2010-03-09T19:10:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	i can't use the live CD because im installing a fully encrypted dualboot system
2010-03-09T19:10:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	unless you can't.
2010-03-09T19:10:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	you think there's security there? Hmm. Well, then... No, I have no answer for you.
2010-03-09T19:12:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	were you going to explain to me why that's not secure or is it off topic if *I* ask about it?
2010-03-09T19:13:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	Not here. It's got some fallacies that make the whole thing pointless to encrypt / I encrypt /home sometimes, but not for my main machine, which is secure.
2010-03-09T19:14:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	could you please clarify "not here"?
2010-03-09T19:14:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	no. You want a encrypted system, that's your call. I can't help you with it. Sorry.
2010-03-09T19:16:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	I apologise but, I'm very confused as to what you're trying to tell me.
2010-03-09T19:16:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	ubuntudualboot	I am saying that encryption is silly, that's all.
2010-03-09T19:16:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	SpaceGhostC2C	ok
