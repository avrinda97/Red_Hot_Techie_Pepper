2005-02-17T13:13:00.000Z	heliolith		i won't mess with the 486s
2005-02-17T13:13:00.000Z	heliolith		DSL linux is a low resource distro?
2005-02-17T13:14:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Yes, it is actually designed and tested on a 486
2005-02-17T13:15:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	right
2005-02-17T13:28:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Where is the school you teach at?
2005-02-17T13:29:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	You've got to be able to find something better than a 486 in southern california.
2005-02-17T13:29:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	I am I am
2005-02-17T13:30:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	I got another array of PIIs that had Redhat on them, they were part of some super array...
2005-02-17T13:31:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	I'd be willing to donate some parts, if you'd like them.  I have some 40GB harddrives and a few motherboards and ~1Ghz CPUs.
2005-02-17T13:31:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	Im me i can send you info that would be nice
2005-02-18T11:11:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	In synaptic, you can right click on the packages that are installed and go to properties.  One of the tabs is installed files.  Look there.
2005-02-18T12:08:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Just run which firefox
2005-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	it gives me /usr/bin/firefox which is a read me file
2005-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	How did you get a readme file named firefox into /usr/bin!?
2005-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	If you haven't messed around, then the file in /usr/bin/ is certainly the binary executable for firefox.
2005-02-18T12:12:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	when tell the shortcut to use that version, it says no such file or dir... oh well it's been a long day maybe i'm not thinking clearly anymore
2005-02-18T12:15:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Did you install 1.0 on your own or through Synaptic?
2005-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	this is one problem I don't seem to figure out from system to system... on my first ubuntu install I did it manually because I couldn't figure out how to do it right... by enabling universe in synaptic, it shows that the latest version is installed, but that's not the version that's running
2005-02-18T12:17:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Are you in warty?
2005-02-18T12:18:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Then I'm surprised that 1.0 is in Synaptic.  I didn't think it ever made it in.
2005-02-18T12:18:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	I've got universe enabled
2005-02-18T12:18:00.000Z	heliolith	ficusplanet	extra repositories
2005-02-18T12:19:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	I didn't think 1.0 was in universe even.
2005-02-18T12:21:00.000Z	ficusplanet	heliolith	Yes.  But I'm in hoary.
