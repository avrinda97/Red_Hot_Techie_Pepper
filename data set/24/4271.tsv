2007-05-20T09:34:00.000Z	mar77i		morning
2007-05-20T09:36:00.000Z	mar77i		trying to get cmedia 8738MX to work on ubuntu... keep failing. anyone?
2007-05-20T09:38:00.000Z	mar77i		thx so far I'm looking. not hearing anything, so options are poor
2007-05-20T09:39:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	is the sound card module loaded?
2007-05-20T09:47:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	have you tried "asoundconf list"?
2007-05-20T09:47:00.000Z	mar77i	brennus390	sound is integrated in kernel. hal-device-manager does not show any hardware that has to do with audio drives.
2007-05-20T09:48:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	ah, figured asoundconf would still show available sound cards...not sure though
2007-05-20T09:49:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	i assume you checked dmesg?
2007-05-20T09:51:00.000Z	mar77i	brennus390	aplay -l returns that no sound cards are found. what do I have to look for in entries returned by dmesg?
2007-05-20T09:52:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	not sure, but maybe pci if it's a pci card...give me a sec...see if i can find something for you
2007-05-20T09:54:00.000Z	mar77i	brennus390	it's onboard a cmedia 8738MX on a msi kt4 ultra mainboard
2007-05-20T10:04:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	can't find anything specifically mentioning sound in dmesg...but i have an onboard sound card an it's loaded via module by default
2007-05-20T10:05:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	also, if your is onboard, what's the chance it is disabled in the bios?
2007-05-20T10:07:00.000Z	mar77i	brennus390	good idea, didn't consider this. but I don't consider me that n00by. brb...
2007-05-20T10:07:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	you don't sound like a n00b...just throwing out ideas...
2007-05-20T10:29:00.000Z	mar77i	brennus390	funny. it actually was deactivated. now its on, recognized with lspci but not with esd.
2007-05-20T10:30:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	well, at least it's a step in the right direction
2007-05-20T10:31:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	did you upgrade this to a new version of ubuntu or was it a clean install?
2007-05-20T10:34:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	cause i've seen issues with upgrading to feisty and esd not seeing things...or something like that
2007-05-20T10:42:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	so lsmod lists the card now?
2007-05-20T10:53:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	you could try manually loading the modules
2007-05-20T10:54:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	no problem...sorry you didn't get it up and running but i think your close...have a good one
2007-05-20T11:08:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	do you mean to customize bash for a particular user?
2007-05-20T11:09:00.000Z	brennus390	mar77i	not sure there is much difference...i do know that on some unix's .bashrc doesn't work well...so you have to use .bash_profile
