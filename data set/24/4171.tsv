2007-06-18T13:50:00.000Z	craigbass1976		Can anyone think of a reason why an ubuntu box would all of a sudden start refusing ssh and http requests?  I just went up to it and rebooted it, and it was ok.  An hour later (once I'm back home a half hour away of course) it's refusing conections again)
2007-06-18T13:51:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I went through the logs and so no evidence of hacking
2007-06-18T13:52:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	could have lost net connection....is it behind a router?
2007-06-18T13:52:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	It's behind a sonicwall, buti t was working fine until this weekend
2007-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	if it suddenly started refusing connections it sounds like an IP address changed somewhere, either internally or your WAN ip changed
2007-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	no.  They're all windows boxes and I haven't forwarded any vnc ports or anything to them
2007-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	nope; static ip
2007-06-18T13:54:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	you can login via ssh from windows, just use putty
2007-06-18T13:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	right, but I can't get to a windows box on that network
2007-06-18T13:54:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	which IP address is static?
2007-06-18T13:55:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	Theirs, the one with the ubuntu box I'm trying to get into
2007-06-18T13:55:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	i mean is the internal IP address static or is the WAN ip static or are they both?
2007-06-18T13:56:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	the public and ubuntu ip are both static.
2007-06-18T13:57:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	did you get my PM?
2007-06-18T13:58:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	yeah
2007-06-18T13:58:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	i get 100% packet loss when pinging that IP
2007-06-18T13:59:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	could be the firewall is dropping them.  I can log into the firewall, so the ip is up
2007-06-18T13:59:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	you sure the ubuntu machine is up then?
2007-06-18T13:59:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	but ssh got you nothing?
2007-06-18T14:00:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	connection refused.  port forwarded to 22, right?
2007-06-18T14:00:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	yep.  Ok, it's not jsut me then
2007-06-18T14:00:00.000Z	craigbass1976	pha|con	having kids is very difficult when one wants to really swear at a box...
2007-06-18T14:01:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	indeed, but i wouldn't know...hehe  well, if it just stopped working chances are the machine locked up
2007-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	pha|con	craigbass1976	maybe he should use nano if he's just editing plain text?  fewer weird commands to have to worry about for just text editing.
