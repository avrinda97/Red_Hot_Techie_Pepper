2006-01-22T10:09:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	have you been to the website for install/build instructions?
2006-01-22T10:09:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	no
2006-01-22T10:09:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	but I'm reading the README-file right now
2006-01-22T10:09:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	cool idea.
2006-01-22T10:11:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	the autogen.sh script will need to be run successfully in order to generate the configure script first
2006-01-22T10:11:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	do you have autoconf and all those installed?
2006-01-22T10:12:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	sh autogen.sh
2006-01-22T10:12:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	could it be that I'm in the wrong directory?
2006-01-22T10:12:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	you need autoconf and automake1.7 at a minimum installed
2006-01-22T10:12:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	that is also a possibility
2006-01-22T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	no it is not. there are no developer tools by default in ubuntu
2006-01-22T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	install 'build-essential autoconf automake1.7"
2006-01-22T10:15:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	build-essential is on the cd, but the auto things are online
2006-01-22T10:15:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	sudo apt-get install
2006-01-22T10:16:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	how do I know for sure that my PC won't crash tragically?
2006-01-22T10:16:00.000Z	nalioth	idefix_	none of us can know the date our boxen will go up in flames

2006-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	idefix_	nalioth	how come it is so much harder to install than qcad?
