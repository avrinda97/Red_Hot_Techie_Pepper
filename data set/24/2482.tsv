2008-11-30T08:26:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	you're x is messed up
2008-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	hit Ctrl + Alt + F5 to switch to terminal (Ctrl + Alt + F7 to get back to X) and then reconfigure x server
2008-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	hang on, I'll get the command
2008-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	the command is "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2008-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	just run through all the options, the defaults should be fine
2008-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntunoo	endoubt	where shoud i put that?
2008-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	in a terminal somewhere
2008-11-30T08:30:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	live cd won't give you a desktop either?
2008-11-30T08:31:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	in the very first menu of the live cd there are boot options
2008-11-30T08:31:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	there will be several for graphical options like -vga or something like that, try some until you get a desktop and then the one that works will tell you what the problem is
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	I forget the exact details but at the livecd menu it will say something like "hit blah for more options"
2008-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntunoo	endoubt	i mean theirs a menu it says demo installition, install in windows, and learn more
2008-11-30T08:37:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	it doesn't give you an other options at the top and bottom of the screen?
2008-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	endoubt	ubuntunoo	that's a good thing
