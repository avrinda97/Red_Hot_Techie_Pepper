2006-07-25T05:38:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom		I'm running Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper (AMD64) on an HP Pavilion dv5000 laptop with an ATi Radeon Xpress 200M. I cannot get the binary drivers to work, they crash the system on boot, and cannot get anything to work with OpenGL. Is there a way to either do software-acceleration OpenGL, or somehow fix the problem with the binary video card driver?
2006-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	software opengl is never accelerated :)
2006-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	I can't get opengl to work period
2006-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	are you running the amd64 version of ubuntu?
2006-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	yes
2006-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	I mentioned this in the big problem statement
2006-07-25T05:40:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	the binary drivers work OK on my HP nx6125 (Mobile Sempron, same chipset)
2006-07-25T05:41:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	well, could have been that you just wanted to point out which kind of processor you have...
2006-07-25T05:41:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	understandable.
2006-07-25T05:41:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	anyway, works fine with x86 (32 bit) ubuntu for me
2006-07-25T05:42:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	well, do you have a 64-bit processor?
2006-07-25T05:43:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	no. but I could simply swap the mobile sempron for a turion to have 64 bit capability...
2006-07-25T05:44:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	and, from what I've heard so far, ubuntu amd64 causes a lot of problems so that you are usually better of using the 32 bit version
2006-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	my advice, as I already told you: use ubuntu x86
2006-07-25T05:50:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	Thank you for your advice, but I'd rather not
2006-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	ok
2006-07-25T05:52:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	but why not? AMD64 doesn't have any real benefits at the moment (besides being incredibly cool)
2006-07-25T05:53:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	not true...math processing is faster
2006-07-25T05:54:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	yeah... but not that much, especially not if the software hasn't been optimized for 64 bit processors
2006-07-25T05:55:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	It will, eventually, and ATi has released 64 drivers, so that's not the problem
2006-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	Well,
2006-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	all ATi drivers are shit anyway
2006-07-25T05:58:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	gregg__	I would have gotten a Nvidia if I could
2006-07-25T05:58:00.000Z	gregg__	kitsuneofdoom	same here
