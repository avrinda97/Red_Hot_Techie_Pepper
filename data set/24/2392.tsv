2009-03-27T18:11:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	which empty files did you remove? sometimes empty files are important...
2009-03-27T18:12:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	unfortunately i made it in a blind way
2009-03-27T18:12:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	deleting files randomly is generally not a good idea :-)
2009-03-27T18:13:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	i realized :(
2009-03-27T18:14:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	depending on what exactly you deleted, a reinstallation might be simplest, especially if you have a separate partition for user data.
2009-03-27T18:16:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	I have no partitions as I un deeply in ubuntu after a virus atack in Windows which destroyed sector 3 of my HD
2009-03-27T18:16:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	reports are
2009-03-27T18:17:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	well, you must have at least one partition, else what were you running ubuntu on?
2009-03-27T18:17:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	/etc/gdm/Xsession user "username" not found
2009-03-27T18:18:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	   =====BEGIN MILESTONES (/usr/sbin/sabayon-apply) =====
2009-03-27T18:19:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	did you run some sort of script to bring you to this state?
2009-03-27T18:20:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	line 107, in <module> sys.xit (utl.EXIT_CODE_NORMAL) SystemExit: 0
2009-03-27T18:21:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	I tryed several ways, but this state never changed and it is as start...
2009-03-27T18:22:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	well, but you had a working system (I assume?), and now you don't. so what exactly did you run to go from state A to state B?
2009-03-27T18:23:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	I run KleenSweep and accepted blind deletion of files and directories empty
2009-03-27T18:24:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	and my system seems to be ok yet as I can get in through root and it stilll manages the printers in a network
2009-03-27T18:25:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	printers conected to my system are addressed by other machines in a network and shared files can be used as well
2009-03-27T18:26:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	prince_jammys asked you a question about the .ICEauthority file, and i'm curious to know the answer as well. do you have this file in your home directory? (note the dot at the beginning of the filename)
2009-03-27T18:27:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	another possiblity would be to create another user, and see if they don't have the same problems when using your system.
2009-03-27T18:28:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	: ok, hold a minute please
2009-04-22T22:15:00.000Z	sipior	FernandoF	i'm fairly certain that you won't be able to increase the space of /cdrom :-)
2009-04-22T22:15:00.000Z	FernandoF	sipior	lol
