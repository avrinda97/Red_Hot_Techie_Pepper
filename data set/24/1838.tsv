2009-07-31T22:43:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	It asks for your own password.
2009-07-31T22:43:00.000Z	jiohdi	grawity	how do I change it?
2009-08-15T18:27:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	If you installed the Sun Java runtime, you need sun-java6-plugin too.
2009-08-15T18:28:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	I don't know. The runtime itself is for standalone applications -- it is not limited to webpages.
2009-08-15T18:29:00.000Z	jiohdi	grawity	I have two firefoxes installed, one that came with ubuntu and one that I got from mozilla as the latest version
2009-08-25T17:42:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	'mount' is a command.
2009-09-04T18:20:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	No, nobody can access your computer over IRC.
2009-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	UNLESS you tend to accept every .exe someone sends to you.
2009-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	jiohdi	grawity	I have accepted nothing .exe so how could all my start up scripts become so corrupted?
2009-09-04T18:21:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	I don't know. But I am sure it is not related to you being on IRC.
2009-09-15T19:48:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	There's an environment variable $PATH that contains a list of directories where to search for programs if you don't specify a path.
2009-09-15T19:48:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	For example, 'ls' is in /bin, and /bin is in $PATH, so you only type 'ls'
2009-09-15T19:48:00.000Z	jiohdi	grawity	in what path?
2009-09-15T19:49:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	echo "$PATH"
2009-09-15T19:50:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	And if you want to run a program that is not in $PATH, you need to specify the full path.
2009-09-15T19:51:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	No, the current directory is never in $PATH by default.
2009-09-15T19:51:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	./someprogram means "run someprogram from the current directory"
2009-09-15T19:52:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	But you did specify the path - by using ./
2009-09-15T19:53:00.000Z	grawity	jiohdi	"." means the current directory, and ./uninstall means a file "uninstall" in the current directory.
