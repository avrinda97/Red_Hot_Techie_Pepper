2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	the bot didn't, I told it to.
2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	the first time i asked?
2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	i must have missed that
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	I missed something to, I told ubotu, to explain it was a bot to you.
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	i caught that part
2007-02-13T11:19:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	im still confused about ndiswrapper though, for software soucres i have universe, main, multiverse, and restricted selected, but when i go to add/remove and search for ndiswrapper it doesnt find anything
2007-02-13T11:20:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	I can't help, I'm not running any wireless cards here. Have you updated your sources?
2007-02-13T11:21:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	after i selected the internet sources it downloaded a updated list if thats what your talking about...
2007-02-13T11:22:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	i was trying to figure out where to get a list of third party repositories, then i stumbled upon a howto that says to select universe to get ndiswrapper but it didnt help
2007-02-13T11:22:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	Ok, keep in mind, your packages are cached locally, so when you uninstall something, and go to fetch it again, your are just getting it from your cache.
2007-02-13T11:23:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	this is a brand new install, and all i have done is add those sources
2007-02-13T11:23:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	what did you use to set up the new repos?
2007-02-13T11:24:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	system > administration > software sources... i selected the other internet sources that were not checked and let it update
2007-02-13T11:25:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	What ver. of Ubuntu are you running? On Dapper, I use sys-admin-synaptic.
2007-02-13T11:26:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	6.10 edgy?
2007-02-13T11:26:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	i mean 6.10 is that edgy?
2007-02-13T11:26:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	So no Synaptic option in sys-admin?
2007-02-13T11:27:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	yeah, just found it in there...
2007-02-13T11:28:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	Ok try that, there is a preferences option, or something like that in the menus, where you can click check boxes, to add the additonal repos.
2007-02-13T11:29:00.000Z	DLB|Maximus	n2diy	i found it in there, whats the diff between add/remove and synaptic?
2007-02-13T11:29:00.000Z	n2diy	DLB|Maximus	It is there to confuse both the newbs and vets alike!
