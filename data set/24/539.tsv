2011-06-19T19:05:00.000Z	beate		Hi there! I need help on formatting a usb hard-drive. Right now, it's completely messed up - how to get just one clean ext3 partition (just for regular files)?
2011-06-19T19:06:00.000Z	edbian	beate	Use gparted (it will erase everything on the drive)
2011-06-19T19:06:00.000Z	beate	edbian	i will try that!
2011-06-19T19:07:00.000Z	edbian	beate	fdisk / mk2fs are cli
2011-06-19T19:09:00.000Z	beate	edbian	so I have deleted everything using gparted. Now I'll create a single new one - primary or extended? (I want to use the usb harddrive for data like a "big usb stick")
2011-06-19T19:10:00.000Z	edbian	beate	Primary.  extended is for adding more than 4 partitions to a hdd
2011-06-19T19:10:00.000Z	beate	edbian	ah, I see. thank you
2011-06-19T19:10:00.000Z	edbian	beate	sure
2011-06-19T19:14:00.000Z	beate	edbian	so, /dev/sdb1 is formatted ext3. How can I mount that into some homedirectory and be able to write to it as non-root?
2011-06-19T19:15:00.000Z	edbian	beate	first mount it (the proper place is in /mnt) but you can put it in any empty folder in your /home
2011-06-19T19:16:00.000Z	beate	edbian	right. But doing so sets the permissions to root
2011-06-19T19:16:00.000Z	edbian	beate	Then chown -R you /path/to/that/folder (which makes you the owner of the whole thing
2011-06-19T19:16:00.000Z	edbian	beate	chown it
2011-06-19T19:16:00.000Z	beate	edbian	chown everytime I mount?
2011-06-19T19:17:00.000Z	edbian	beate	No, only once
2011-06-19T19:17:00.000Z	edbian	beate	After you've mounted it
2011-06-19T19:17:00.000Z	edbian	beate	But you will have to mount it every time if you don't but an entry into fstab
2011-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	beate	edbian	seems to work
2011-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	edbian	beate	Yeah?
2011-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	edbian	beate	Good
2011-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	beate	edbian	wols : thank you both very much!
2011-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	edbian	beate	You should put something in /etc/fstab so that you don't have to mount it everytime
2011-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	beate	edbian	wols : I'll be back in 5min!
2011-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	edbian	beate	ok?
