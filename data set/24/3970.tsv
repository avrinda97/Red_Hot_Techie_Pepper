2008-04-20T16:19:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	then your card probably works, u need to adjust some settings
2008-04-20T16:20:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	double click on the volume icon ont he top right corner

2008-04-20T16:52:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	does lsmod | grep snd give you any output?
2008-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	nope
2008-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	use pastebin
2008-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	my nick is Gin by the way not GLn
2008-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	it seems there are drivers loaded for your card
2008-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	as I said, play with the settings..
2008-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	are your speakers turned on?
2008-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	how are you testing your sound card to see if it works or not?
2008-04-20T17:01:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	are they set to auto detect?
2008-04-20T17:02:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	a faster way to test is, play a long movie, then leave it on and play with your sound settings
2008-04-20T17:02:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	gutsy right?
2008-04-20T17:03:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	:S Hardy uses pulse audio.. try in #Ubuntu+1 :\
2008-04-20T17:05:00.000Z	GIn	it_rains	but I am sure your card works, because the drivers are loaded.  take your time and play with the volume settings, unmute, check the switchs, raise the volume bars etc. g'luck
