2010-09-06T00:43:00.000Z	ipunk		how to mount a damn iso
2010-09-06T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	you start by dropping the language and attitude
2010-09-06T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	mouont -o loop $iso_image $mount_point
2010-09-06T00:47:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	 gives me this mount: only root can do that
2010-09-06T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	use "sudo" in front of the command
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	 the folder i wanted to mount on is empty
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	that's fine
2010-09-06T00:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	an empty directory is a good mount point
2010-09-06T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	then the iso is empty
2010-09-06T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	it can be 4.3GB of empty space
2010-09-06T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	why did you put $ signs in
2010-09-06T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	$ is a varible
2010-09-06T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	remove the $ sign
2010-09-06T00:53:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	 rld-stf4.iso: No such file or directory
2010-09-06T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	then you're not in the directory that contains that file
2010-09-06T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	thats fine
2010-09-06T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	your audio controller may just have a poor kernel module
2010-09-06T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	yes but you're not using windows 7, hence why I said it may just have a poor kernel module
2010-09-06T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	kernel is basically the linux "driver manager"
2010-09-06T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	what is your audio controller, that's the real question
2010-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	 how do I check whats my audio controller?
2010-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ipunk	check your hardware specs (back in 5 minutes)
2010-09-06T14:01:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	                        Intel 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller
2010-09-06T14:17:00.000Z	ipunk	ikonia	                        Intel 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller
