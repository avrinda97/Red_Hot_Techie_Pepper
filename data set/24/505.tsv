2011-07-26T18:23:00.000Z	redmenace		ummm should the syncing instructions work with ipod nano 6th gneration?
2011-07-26T18:24:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	Given that it runs same version of iOS, it should interface identically
2011-07-26T18:24:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	i dont think it uses iOS
2011-07-26T18:25:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	What iPod is it?
2011-07-26T18:32:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	Stupid question but did you unplug it without safely removing it?
2011-07-26T18:33:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	Sadly I don't have a 6th gen to test on
2011-07-26T18:33:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	it plays when i have it pluged in
2011-07-26T18:35:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	there's no subdirectories in my Music folder, except for 2 that i made
2011-07-26T18:40:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	It looks like it's unsupported by gtkpod
2011-07-26T18:41:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	You may be able to get something working under virtualbox or wine
2011-07-26T18:45:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	That's on the 6g or the old one?
2011-07-26T18:46:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	I only have iPhone 4, iPad and iPod Touch 3
2011-07-26T18:47:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	They all use the same library I think
2011-07-26T18:47:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	ill try then get back to ya
2011-07-26T18:54:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	It's because the hash which is used to store things is common to a library
2011-07-26T18:56:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	There is a hash which is used to protect the upload mechanism and nobody has reverse engineered it yet
2011-07-26T18:57:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	I think it works with mediamonkey as well
2011-07-26T18:59:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	No
2011-07-26T18:59:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	can i still put music on it that i buy from banshee?
2011-07-26T19:00:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2008/03/18/enable-support-for-7th-gen-ipods-in-ubuntu/
2011-07-26T19:01:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	Not sure if it will, it's from 2008. AFAIK the 6th gen iPods weren't out then
2011-07-26T19:05:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	there is one part i think can use
2011-07-26T19:09:00.000Z	redmenace	Reikoku	can you go to that arcticle plz?
2011-07-26T19:11:00.000Z	Reikoku	redmenace	Sorry, I was on the phone, what's up?
