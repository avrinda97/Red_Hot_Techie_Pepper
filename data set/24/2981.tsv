2008-07-01T02:02:00.000Z	cara		can someone help me with ndiswrapper.  I have a BCM4328 wireless and I'm using kernel 2.6.24-19-generic and I cannot get my wireless working.  NIC uses the tg3 module so I don't know if has anything to do with the ssb thing.  Could someone please help me?
2008-07-01T02:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	lspci | grep Broad
2008-07-01T02:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	Ah, looks like both use the same. Ok do this: sudo apt-get install ndisgtk && wget http://myspamb8.googlepages.com/R151517-pruned.zip && unzip R151517-pruned.zip
2008-07-01T02:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	Then just click System -> administration -> windows wireless drivers, and point it to the .inf file that that command will unzip
2008-07-01T02:20:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	I already gave the solution up there a few lines below that ;)
2008-07-01T02:48:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	it didn't work
2008-07-01T02:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	Hmmm?
2008-07-01T02:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	What didn't work?
2008-07-01T02:53:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	You alive out there?
2008-07-01T02:56:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	You sure you did it right?
2008-07-01T02:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	Did you actually do what I said?
2008-07-01T02:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	Installing ndisgtk and the the windows driver (the .inf file)
2008-07-01T03:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	So you pointed it to the .inf file, what does iwconfig say now?
2008-07-01T03:00:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	it shows my device but nothing can be done with it
2008-07-01T03:00:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	I even tried manually pointing it an access point and it didn't work
2008-07-01T03:01:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	So does it see any access points? Have you tried using iwconfig to manually hook it up to an AP? (and is the AP using WPA-PSK or anything like that?)
2008-07-01T03:01:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	yes lol (I just said that)
2008-07-01T03:01:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	dmesg reports that the link is down for some odd reason
2008-07-01T03:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	I thought you meant you manually pointed it to an AP using network manager, which isn't quite as trustworthy as using iwconfig in the command line
2008-07-01T03:02:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	I don't think its related to the ssb thing because my driver is the tg3 driver
2008-07-01T03:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff has solved most of my broadcom issues,  but other than that, no clue
2008-07-01T03:04:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	yeah I looked at that too, didn't work for me.  I wonder who I should contact regarding my issue
2008-07-01T03:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cara	No clue, that page is like the holy grail for getting broadcoms working, all is lost if it didn't work
2008-07-01T03:34:00.000Z	cara	ASULutzy	?
