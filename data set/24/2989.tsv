2008-06-02T07:04:00.000Z	sgmadison		i have downloaded ubuntu-desktop it installs fine but after the loading screen goes to a black screen, same from livecd - this is an optiplex 745 that has installed debian and linuxmint just fine - any ideas? I've been trying to get it going for 3 days, i'm a little lost as to why debian boots fine, as does linuxmint (which is based on ubuntu? or debian at least)
2008-06-02T07:05:00.000Z	sgmadison		note that if i install ubuntu-server, it loads fine, it's obviously an issue with gnome or x
2008-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	 It's probably some X option that video card doesn't like -- reboot the CD again and check the list of boot options, theres one for a 'safe video mode', though I dont recall what it is.
2008-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	- thanks i'll try that
2008-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	np mate, let us know how it goes.
2008-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	use safe video mode produces an interesting result, it loads to a very artifact infested screen, gets a busy cursor, and then goes completely white - with the cursor still visible and active
2008-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	Wow.  What kinda system again?
2008-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	however while I was typing that, it looks like xserver restarted and i'm on the desktop now - if I install how do I enable whatever this did?
2008-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	an optiplex 745, intel 975G chipset/onboard video if i'm not mistaken, I've nveer had an issue with it under windows or any other linux distro before
2008-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	 I *think* whatever boot options you use on the cd are propogated to the installation.  I remember having to use a certain flag for a laptop and the issue never occured in the installed copy.
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	Pretty recent chipset, this is Hardy?
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	correct
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	8.04, downloaded and burned yesterday
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	 Wierd.  I've never used it on that chipset, I wonder if it's a chipset-specific bug.
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	well, the last time I burned it was yesterday, I thought maybe something was wrong with the CD
2008-06-02T07:11:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	I've googled and found other people reporting the issue as far back as the GX260 on gutsy gibbon, but it looks like anytime someone fixes it they never say how...
2008-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	Anyway, whatever flag you booted with could be appended to the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to produce the same result, theoretically.  I think the installation LiveCD is the same kernel.
2008-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	I'm going to try enabling the safe video mode and installing, I'll report back about how ti goes =P
2008-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	For the record, I think safe video mode uses the Xorg "vesa" driver instead of autodetecting nvidia, nv, radeon, intel, etc.  I'm guessing the chipset would autodetect intel and try that.
2008-06-02T07:15:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	honestly, this is for a little 'rack' of 12 optiplex's, I wanted to try something besides debian, I like having a gui environment instead of just staring at terminals when i play with them, but once they're set up I really just remote desktop in with vnc
2008-06-02T07:15:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	 Then vesa is fine ;).  I can't say I agree with you though, I usually roll out ubuntu-server on .. uh.. servers :)
2008-06-02T07:16:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	I'm just not totally comfortable with my terminal skills yet, I use the terminal alot, but for some things I'm just not "there" yet
2008-06-02T07:18:00.000Z	sgmadison	askreet	are you familiar at all with dhcpd?
2008-06-02T07:26:00.000Z	askreet	sgmadison	 Are you on the installed system?
