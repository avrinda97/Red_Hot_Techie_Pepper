2007-03-20T16:31:00.000Z	awilcox		Hrm, I haven't done that for a long time, _seanc_.  In fact SuSE's X was so screwed that is why I switched to Ubuntu.
2007-03-20T16:32:00.000Z	awilcox		no more screwing around with X :)
2007-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	awilcox		Okay I just tried to reinstall Netscape 7.02 as a normal user.  It installs as a normal user, but STILL won't open.
2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	awilcox		Is there a Netscape channel?
2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	that is still around?
2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	Yes?
2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	I have Netscape 7.02 that I must get working on Linux.
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	awilcox		And nobody here seems to know what the problem is.
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	sounds like you may have to run it in wine
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	if they dont have a linus version
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	they have a Linux version, I am running it, but it will only run as root.
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	change the permissions
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	LadyNikon		!permissions
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	I installed it as a normal user.  I also did chmod 777 netscape7 -R
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	see the links above
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	I have already done this.
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	then thats all i know
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	I have chmod 777 netscape7 -R
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	LadyNikon		it should work under user
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	yes it should, that is why I need help.
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	is there a usergroup for it?
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	awilcox	LadyNikon	Netscape?  No there isn't.
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	awilcox		Maybe I should just run as root.
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	LadyNikon	awilcox	sorry i couldnt think of anything else :(
