2011-03-12T14:35:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	did you try sudo apt-get clean?
2011-03-12T14:35:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	yeah i tried that....it did not do any difference
2011-03-12T14:38:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	what version of ubuntu
2011-03-12T14:43:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	its 10.04
2011-03-12T14:47:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	http://www.ithowto.ro/2008/10/howto-increase-apt-gets-cache-limit/
2011-03-12T14:48:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	and then sudo apt-get update
2011-03-12T15:03:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	do i need to restart before it works?
2011-03-12T15:03:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	should just have to do sudo apt-get update
2011-03-12T15:04:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	brb
2011-03-12T15:09:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	its stilol not working :(
2011-03-12T15:09:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	i set it to 10MB, did update and restarted
2011-03-12T15:11:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	did you do apt-cache clean?
2011-03-12T15:11:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	ahh now i tried setting it to 50Mb and it seems to work better
2011-03-12T15:14:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	is it possible somehow to see how much cache size is actually needed ? Instead of just guessing
2011-03-12T15:16:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	i think it depends on how much you are doing.
2011-03-12T15:17:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	you mean how many packages are installed?
2011-03-12T15:18:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	apt cache is similar to get, but a separate command: http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/UNIX/updating-redhat/apt-howto/how-to-use-apt-cache.html
2011-03-12T15:20:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	apt-cache stats shows me: Total space accounted for: 17.4M
2011-03-12T15:20:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	probably thats it
2011-03-12T15:20:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	probably. that's why 50 was enough
2011-03-12T15:25:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	exactly
2011-03-12T15:25:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	thx a lot
2011-03-12T15:26:00.000Z	milamber	Diverdude	no problem :)  once you get your system configured the way you need it, gnu/linux really is rock solid. come back with any more issues
2011-03-12T15:27:00.000Z	Diverdude	milamber	yeah...its just that there a lot of things to configure
