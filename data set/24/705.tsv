2011-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	Trfsrfr		can anybody here direct me to somewhere I can get some rookie help? ubuntu-beginners is empty.
2011-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	If you're using Ubuntu then yes, this is the place to be. For dual monitors have you tried using "Monitors" in System Settings?
2011-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	What happens when you try to configure dual monitors?
2011-05-22T05:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	Your messages to me will only be highlighted in my client if you use my full nick.
2011-05-22T06:00:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	and ubotto - not understanding the tab function, and hitting the key doesnt do anything
2011-05-22T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	If you type "Jorda" then hit tab it doesn't complete automatically to "Jordan_U" ?
2011-05-22T06:02:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	now it did.  Maybe I didnt type enough letters
2011-05-22T06:03:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	did you see the error message above?
2011-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	"the selected config for displays could not be applied, required virtual size..."
2011-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	Did you log out then back in again?
2011-05-22T06:09:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	I did. No luck.
2011-05-22T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	Do you get the same error when you try to add the second monitor again after logging out and in?
2011-05-22T06:11:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	I have only tried to log in out once. Let me try again.
2011-05-22T06:30:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	I tried loggin in and out, and still get the same error message.
2011-05-22T06:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	What graphics card are you using?
2011-05-22T06:32:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	I am running a radeon hd4650, its in the supported list
2011-05-22T06:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	Have you tried the "Additional Drivers" utility?
2011-05-22T06:34:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	I probably did awhile ago. I used to have both monitors and sound working, but then I think I let it automatic update and it all went away
2011-05-22T06:38:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	where is the additionally drivers utility located?
2011-05-22T06:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	In System Settings.
2011-05-22T06:46:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	The additional drivers utility says that I am using is a proprietary driver.
2011-05-22T06:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	You can try disabling the proprietary driver, but that may just make things worse.
2011-05-22T06:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Trfsrfr	Actually, part of the problem may be that you weren't using ATI's tools for setting up displays.
2011-05-22T06:52:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	Jordan_U	 I will try ATI's tools. i'll be back shortly.
