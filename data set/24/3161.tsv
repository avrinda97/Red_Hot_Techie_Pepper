2008-07-03T05:32:00.000Z	Bidget		hey guys I was in yesterday trying to fix my problem of installing zsnes but I ran out of time, anyone around that could help me? for some reason when I try and install using the command sudo apt-get install zsnes it tells me that zsnes has no installation candidate
2008-07-03T05:33:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	using hardy?  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install zsnes
2008-07-03T05:33:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	wait wait
2008-07-03T05:33:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	I actually used sudo apt-get install upgrade
2008-07-03T05:33:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	check your software sources via system->administration and make sure "universe" repositories are enabled
2008-07-03T05:34:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	k one sec
2008-07-03T05:34:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	they are all enabled
2008-07-03T05:35:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	in that case, you should have it in your repos... it's part of universe... if you can't get it via apt, you can download the .deb via http://packages.ubuntu.com
2008-07-03T05:35:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	well I downloaded a file from the zsnes website but it is a bz2 file any idea how to install it that way?
2008-07-03T05:35:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	it is .tar.bz2 if that helps any
2008-07-03T05:35:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	or would it just be better to get it from the package ubuntu website
2008-07-03T05:36:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	you don't have to compile... CZ-18 is a fudspreader ;)  though i agree that apt would be better
2008-07-03T05:39:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	alright well Im just gonna do a restart and see if that helps at all
2008-07-03T05:43:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	its still telling me that zsnes is unavailable but is referred to by another package, it means that the package is either missing, obsolete, or only available from another source. Package zsnes has no installation candidate :(
2008-07-03T05:44:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	http://ubuntu.secs.oakland.edu/pool/universe/z/zsnes/zsnes_1.510-2ubuntu1_i386.deb
2008-07-03T05:45:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	thanks :) do I just double click it?
2008-07-03T05:45:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	probably
2008-07-03T05:45:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	thanks :)
2008-07-03T05:46:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	oh thats odd.... when I double click it it opens up and then says Status: ERROR: WRONG ARCHITECTURE 'i386'
2008-07-03T05:46:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	aww, you're a 64-bit user... sorry... no zsnes for you.. you'll have to compile it
2008-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	aw damnit hahaha. I never get to do things the easy way!
2008-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	you'll have to compile it... try this forum post  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=588744&highlight=dfreer+zsnes
2008-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	burner_	Bidget	or, as mentioned, install 32-bit ubuntu
2008-07-03T05:48:00.000Z	Bidget	burner_	I'll try the compile option first haha
