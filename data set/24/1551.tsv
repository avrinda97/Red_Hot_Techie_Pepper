2010-11-13T12:25:00.000Z	surt		Hi guys, having an issue with slow i/o disk speeds. 3d effects (compiz) are lightning quick and as long as an request doesn't involve disk access it's normal. Decompression and removing and installing software is abysmally slow.
2010-11-13T12:26:00.000Z	surt		Like pre 486 slow.
2010-11-13T12:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	check your disk with palimset, or some other utility.
2010-11-13T12:28:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	What is the synatx you suggest to check the disk?
2010-11-13T12:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	go to system/administration/disk utility and browse around in there - check your drives there first.
2010-11-13T12:30:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	Do you know the terminal command? I use xubuntu.
2010-11-13T12:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	you can use fsck, but you'll have to restart to do that I believe.
2010-11-13T12:31:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	What is the binary name?
2010-11-13T12:31:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	Of the application you recommend I check out...
2010-11-13T12:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	I'll dig that up, ... fsck - FileSystemChecKer
2010-11-13T12:32:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	I know what fsck is, but I just need the first app you recommended. I think If I knew how to fully operate fsck I probably wouldn't be here ;-)
2010-11-13T12:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	check out that last post here: http://www.overclock.net/linux-unix/588130-ubuntu-9-10-failing-hard-disk.html
2010-11-13T13:25:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	what do you mean by extraction?
2010-11-13T13:25:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	Extraction of an array of rar files for example.
2010-11-13T13:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	sonds like a disk IO buffer issue to me.
2010-11-13T13:26:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	Yes, the extraction begins very quickly then practically stops. That sounds right to me...
2010-11-13T13:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	do you have another drive handy?
2010-11-13T13:27:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	 I have four...
2010-11-13T13:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	In the system now?
2010-11-13T13:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	are you using the motherboard RAID system?
2010-11-13T13:28:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	The disk is about a year old, roughly.
2010-11-13T13:28:00.000Z	surt	greezmunkey	No.
2010-11-13T13:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	there it is!
2010-11-13T13:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	surt	the e0 is a dead give away
