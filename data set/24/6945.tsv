2005-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	guillem		It is a LG studiobworks 19 inch
2005-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	guillem		Wich one is DVI?
2005-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	guillem		I have adaptor for the largest one to the "usual" one
2005-07-21T15:44:00.000Z	guillem		However there is not signal at the largest one right now
2005-07-21T15:44:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	try that.
2005-07-21T15:44:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	you will probably have to reboot.
2005-07-21T15:45:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	do I have to restart the computer with the monitor plugged at DVI one?
2005-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	just try it for me? I'm curious now. :)
2005-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	how do I enable the DVI port? it is automagic or do I need something?
2005-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	I really want to try all the available options :-))
2005-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	better?
2005-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	figuired.. it seems to be worryingly common these days :/
2005-07-21T15:53:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	definitely better quailty. Still some small shadow after high contrast zones but this used to happen with the old computer also (probably because high resolution and refresh rates) It is not anoying so far
2005-07-21T15:54:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	great :> another satisfied customer :>
2005-07-21T15:55:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	I'm a bit worried, nevertheless...
2005-07-21T15:55:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	I won't be able to use dualhead unless I try with Xyc0 's  method,....
2005-07-21T15:57:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	to be fair.. I'm guessing it's one of the 5200s ?
2005-07-21T15:58:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	no
2005-07-21T15:58:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	NVIDIA Corporation NV40 [GeForce 6200 TurboCache] 
2005-07-21T15:59:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	however, nvidia drivers do not perform well in 3D accel... The driver complains about my kernel and I don't know if it is that the problem...
2005-07-21T15:59:00.000Z	Shorty`	guillem	does it do it in windows?
2005-07-21T15:59:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	I don't have windows at all.
2005-07-21T16:00:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	 "NVRM: WARNING [...]  ychange_page_attr kernel interface [...]  you update to a 2.6.11 or newer kernel"
2005-07-21T16:09:00.000Z	guillem	Shorty`	no, I'm just gessing that since customers tend to buy TFT monitors lately, the old CRT outputs might have been lowered their quality checks. This would make sense if TFT monitors do not use the old VGA outputs....
