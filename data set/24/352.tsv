2011-11-01T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	what GPU do you use?
2011-11-01T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	yes it does
2011-11-01T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
2011-11-01T23:11:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	How do I do that?
2011-11-01T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	some nvidia gpus don't like the nouveau driver. The option
2011-11-01T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	makes it

2012-02-07T08:26:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	thanks, I'll check this out now
2012-02-07T08:26:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	I was on here earlier trying to get help, and someone ended up giving me this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1837235 said it was out of his abilities though :/
2012-11-07T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	in an EEE PC....really?
2012-11-07T05:50:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	would you not install proprietary drivers if the resolution is horrible?
2012-11-07T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	if its an Intel GPU or a SiS GPU, there aren't any to install
2012-11-07T05:51:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	i've never owned a eee pc, so I didn't know they were running intel graphics
2012-11-07T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	then how can you advise? Not all systems need, or can even use proprietary drivers. Most netbooks use crappy Intel or SiS or Chrome GPUs.
2012-11-07T05:53:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	sorry, I gave bad advice.
2012-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	you can use rsync or dd to transfer over easily
2012-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	might be a dumb question, but could I just cp instead of dd? then install grub on the new drive? or would that work?
2012-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	sure but remember to preserve ownership, you will also need to install grub to the mbr of the sd card
2012-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	so could I just use parted to partition the new drive, then copy everything over and do grub-install to /dev/sdb1 or whatever my boot partition will be?
2012-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	/dev/sda  not /dev/sda1
2012-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	deper29	ActionParsnip	yes, my bad
2012-11-07T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deper29	its annoying
