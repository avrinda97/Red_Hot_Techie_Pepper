2007-12-25T05:53:00.000Z	turdy		hi all
2007-12-25T05:53:00.000Z	turdy		this is probably not the place to ask but I dont' seem to be able to get an answer anywhere else
2007-12-25T05:54:00.000Z	turdy		I have a analogue tv tuner card (Yuan PG600), Ubuntu installed the IVTV driver for me
2007-12-25T05:54:00.000Z	turdy		so that's all good
2007-12-25T05:54:00.000Z	turdy		but for some strange reason, the card is on mute and no matter what I do, I can't unmute it
2007-12-25T05:54:00.000Z	turdy		I can see video though
2007-12-25T05:54:00.000Z	turdy		can anyone offer me any advice?
2007-12-25T05:55:00.000Z	turdy		I was just oging to buy a new one but its god damn expensive for an analogue tv card
2007-12-25T05:55:00.000Z	turdy		and aI'm not even entirely sure if its the drivers fault
2007-12-25T05:55:00.000Z	Falados	turdy	Did you try the sound controller? You probably need to view all of the sliders so that you can unmute them
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		tried that
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		didn't work
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		I checked using the vl4ctl tool
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	Falados	turdy	Are you sure you selected the right device?
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		and it says the audio is muted
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		I can hear music and everything
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		just the freaking tv tuner card decides to produce no audio
2007-12-25T05:56:00.000Z	turdy		(as you can imagine, tv without sound isn't much fun)
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	Falados		If it's a huge problem, you can probably get a cable to go from your Tuner's audio out to your sound card's line-in
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	turdy	Falados	The tuner doesn't have an audio out
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	Falados	turdy	Ah, darn
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	turdy		It sucks!
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	turdy		everything works, just the stupid audio
2007-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	Falados	turdy	I had a 10$ tuner, isnt' worth the silicon its printed on
