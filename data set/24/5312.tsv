2006-08-20T08:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Have you also got IDE drive(s) on your machine=
2006-08-20T08:16:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	yes a second 80GB IDE
2006-08-20T08:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Then that's your problem.
2006-08-20T08:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Did you use the live cd?
2006-08-20T08:17:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	LiveCD yes
2006-08-20T08:18:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	I'm running that now....
2006-08-20T08:18:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	btw, they should have Xchat or irssi installed on the liveCD ;)
2006-08-20T08:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	getting solution for you
2006-08-20T08:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	isn't irssi on there? o.O
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	are you booting off the IDE or sata drive?
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	SATA
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	You might need to change that and then edit your /boot/grub/device.map file
2006-08-20T08:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	ie. your grub might be installed on the ide drive.
2006-08-20T08:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	another alternative is to re-install grub and put it on (hd1)
2006-08-20T08:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	if you choose the former you might also need to remap the drives to get windows to boot at all.
2006-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	if you do the latter you should probably be ok with the menu.lst you've got.
2006-08-20T08:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Are you comfortable with setting up a chroot environment?
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Well you'll need to mount the partition(s) on which ubuntu is installed and then bind-mount the /dev and /proc filesystems then simply run sudo chroot /path/to/installed/linux/
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	It's really not hard
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	Unless ofcourse you've got the alternate install cd.
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	that will repair grub for you iirc.
2006-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	yes. the installation should have detected your windows install and will chainload it fine.
2006-08-20T08:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	gz1	the problem is that grub gets confused which drive is hd0 and hd1 when there are both sata and pata disks present.
2006-08-20T08:34:00.000Z	gz1	BlueEagle	ok I'll hopefully see you guys on the flip side...thanks :)
