2012-06-24T06:33:00.000Z	hylian	tking	if you uninstall the dropbox deb package, does anything change? could this somehow be a dropbox related software situation?
2012-06-24T06:34:00.000Z	tking	hylian	not sure, using linux first time for almost a week now
2012-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	hylian	tking	it can't hurt.
2012-06-24T06:37:00.000Z	hylian	tking	wait, I misunderstood. I thought for some reason your desktop was loading filed from dropbox, I didn't get that you where using dropbox to share screenshots, my bad..
2012-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	tking	hylian	ooh i c
2012-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	hylian	tking	hmmm. This is Ubuntu doing this?
2012-06-24T06:39:00.000Z	tking	hylian	yes
2012-06-24T06:41:00.000Z	tking	hylian	i charge my iphone with my laptop, one thing i notice is that when i connect iphone to usb to charge some stuffs are mounted like iphone drives and when i eject or use savely remove from dock/daskboard, it makes the dock disappear and reappear like it crashed
2012-06-24T06:42:00.000Z	tking	hylian	am on desktop doing everything normal don't know the next time it will happen, cos it might suddenly do same again
2012-06-24T07:17:00.000Z	hylian	tking	there are usually to reasons for this. One is the file, or files in question are inproperly named for Windows. Anything with , for instance, won't work. so jamie's first dance recital.wmv won't play or copy over.
2012-06-24T07:19:00.000Z	tking	hylian	so should i rename all files and folders? but before installing ubuntu, i hv used most of the files on windows b4 some are school works
2012-06-24T07:20:00.000Z	hylian	tking	I was just mentioning one possibility... hmmm. well if you are selecting a mass of files, one wrongly named file will stop windows in it's tracks. i would try to copy over like 10 files ata  time, and see if the error still persists.
2012-06-24T07:21:00.000Z	hylian	tking	the backup drive, is it ntfs?
2012-06-24T07:22:00.000Z	tking	hylian	yes ntfs
2012-06-24T07:22:00.000Z	hylian	tking	have you added any new files since using ubuntu that could be strangely named? if there is even one file in a folder that is named in a way that is unfriendly to windows, you will not be able to copy the folder... and are there any error messages?
2012-06-24T07:24:00.000Z	tking	hylian	escott  well i just thought of copying the files from ubuntu to the windows desktop since i can access windows directory from here :) what do u think?
2012-06-24T07:30:00.000Z	hylian	tking	if you have ubuntu and windows running at the same time, ubuntu is going to control it's hard drive partition. You would either need to shutdown ubuntu, or have ubuntu do it. and you may or may not need super user priveleges in Ubuntu.. although I would think not if your files are going from ntfs to ntfs...
2012-06-24T07:32:00.000Z	hylian	tking	Miguelito escott i have to go, time for me to crash. I hope I was a little helpful. :)
2012-06-24T07:32:00.000Z	tking	hylian	thanks for ur help good night
