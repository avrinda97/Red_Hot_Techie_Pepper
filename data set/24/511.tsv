2011-09-03T10:43:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	there's no difference except price
2011-09-03T10:45:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	it's much more difficult due to stupidly diffiult apache configuration
2011-09-03T10:46:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	Hmm
2011-09-03T12:07:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	you bind apache to your external IP.
2011-09-03T12:09:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	Or are you referring to my PC
2011-09-03T12:10:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	I mean local hosting
2011-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	okie local.. Hmm.. know of a way to make it work without having to forward anyport? Cuz I don't have a router
2011-09-03T12:28:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	what are you trying to do?
2011-09-03T12:33:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	I am tying to create a webserver on my ubuntu desktop so I can host my website on it
2011-09-03T12:34:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	I do have a static IP  But I do not have a router
2011-09-03T12:34:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	you don't need a router
2011-09-03T12:34:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	GREAT!

2011-09-03T12:35:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	 Please give me the 411
2011-09-03T12:35:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	no, your ISP forwards ports for you
2011-09-03T12:36:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	So I just install apache and follow the instructions on the wiki and i'm goog to go? it will become visible and accessible on the ww from any PC?

2011-09-03T12:40:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	then how will i access my website from another computer?
2011-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	you provide your external IP address, it gets mapped to your provider's local address
2011-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	Lint	wh1zz0	of course
2011-09-03T12:43:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Lint	Okie thanks.. I'll give it a try... one last thing please..
