2009-02-18T22:55:00.000Z	thecookie		Hmm. I'm trying to install ubuntu 8.10. The cd boots up fine, I get to chose to install it. I gest stuck and thrown into BusyBox built-in shell (ash)
2009-02-18T22:55:00.000Z	thecookie		What could be the problem?
2009-02-18T22:55:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	may be rootsystem not found
2009-02-18T22:56:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	And how would I make the installer find it? :)
2009-02-18T22:56:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 you can look with mount wether it is mountet under /root/yourroutsystem
2009-02-18T22:57:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	rootfs on /
2009-02-18T22:57:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	one reason could be not the driver for the filesystem used
2009-02-18T22:57:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	It's a empty new disk
2009-02-18T22:58:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 I had the case, when i started an existing installation
2009-02-18T23:01:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	usually you have an error-message, when you come to busybox
2009-02-18T23:03:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	Yeah, No controller found.
2009-02-18T23:05:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	you boot from a CD?  you can try options like failsafe
2009-02-18T23:07:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	Yeah, I do. I'll try to see if there are any booting options
2009-02-18T23:09:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	Safe graphics mode or use driver update cd?
2009-02-18T23:11:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 it it's a hw-recognition problem you may avoid some tests, for example with acpi, but I have no Idea what controler it misses...
2009-02-18T23:11:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	may be the hard-disk controller, may be there is a module missing
2009-02-18T23:11:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	Yeah, I guessed. I tried searching google.. but I can't seem to find someone with the same problem + computer model. It's a shuttle sd37p2
2009-02-18T23:14:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	I guess it can be. I did boot up gparted before at least. So there should be a driver for it
2009-02-18T23:14:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 ah gparted worked...
2009-02-18T23:15:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	I guess I have to do some sort of custon like usb installer to get stuff working?
2009-02-18T23:16:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 you can install an ubuntu on a usb-Stick... and boot from there
2009-02-18T23:16:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	Yeah, I meant.. I wold need the disk driver on it tho? Otherwise I would get the same problem
2009-02-18T23:17:00.000Z	pogay	thecookie	 differnt drives have differnt drivers I guess,  but it's difficult to say
2009-02-18T23:18:00.000Z	thecookie	pogay	I remember an app that prepares the usb stick with a boot image.. somewhere on sourceforge.. you remember the name?
