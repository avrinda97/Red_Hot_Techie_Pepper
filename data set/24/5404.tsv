2009-07-15T23:11:00.000Z	djzn		which is the BEST video graphic vendor towards linux distributions... nVidia? AMD-ATI? or Intel ?
2009-07-15T23:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	Intel graphics usually bad,   ATI  have good Linux support I think,   Nividia  have pretty good Linux support, only thing is though that their drivers are propritary and closed source
2009-07-15T23:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	oh yeah and with  Nividia the drivers have to be installed from the Ubuntu repo, or bad things can happen
2009-07-15T23:14:00.000Z	djzn	sebsebseb	i am looking for a mobo, am thinking of these AMD-ATI chipsets, are they any good ?
2009-07-15T23:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	ATI  catalyzst drivers or something, people had issues with, when it came to Ubuntu
2009-07-15T23:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	Nividia are one of the best  when it comes to  graphics card support and Linux, even though their  drivers are closed
2009-07-15T23:16:00.000Z	djzn	sebsebseb	i currently have a nvidia chipset, it works quite well.. but i was wondering if i am missing something about ati / amd
2009-07-15T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	I have used  Nivida  with Linux since  before Ubuntu,  so  2004,  and not had issues
2009-07-15T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	Fedora  Core 2 and 4 on old computer with Nividia  no problems,  Ubuntu for a bit on that one,    and then this later computer with of  course a later Nivida card and no problems.
2009-07-15T23:18:00.000Z	djzn	sebsebseb	ATI has a branch for open drivers, right, and then a commercial closed source drivers branch?
2009-07-15T23:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	closed source is bad,  generally  really  most closed source programs are bad, because of the vender lock in and all that,  visit gnu.org and then go to philosphey section for more info if interested.   However  for  Nivida graphics card i'll make an exception   from using the  closed source  drivers and  knowing they tend to work well on Linux.
2009-07-15T23:20:00.000Z	djzn	sebsebseb	but you're then telling me that ATI is open source, but not so good?
2009-07-15T23:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	I think with Nivida and Linux  though,   the issues will come, if  your using a really old graphics card,   or  you got something way to fancy.
2009-07-15T23:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	well people have had issues with all of them,  Intel,  AMD,  Nivida, etc,  but generally  Nivida works well on Linux,  as for ATI  I haven't used them for graphics as far as I know
2009-07-15T23:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	or is the other computer ATI hmm
2009-07-15T23:21:00.000Z	djzn	sebsebseb	i have also used the downloadable nvidia stock driver in linux and worked quite well....
2009-07-15T23:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	well  with Ubuntu getting the driver directly from  Nivida tends to mess things up
2009-07-15T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	hence why  I sadi to get from the repo earlier
2009-07-15T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	well I have said  what I can say basically so,  you could always  Google for more info,  or  go to  ##linux  the general Linux channel and find out more there
2009-07-15T23:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	oh yeah  your questions are about Hardware and Linux so ##hardware makes sense
2009-10-02T00:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	uhmm well
2009-10-02T00:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	Ext4 isn't perfectly stable in 9.04, because of the kernel they have and that
2009-11-05T06:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	as far as I know that bug is not in 9.04's optional  Ext4 support,  but that's not perfectly stable since the kernel they  have and such
2009-11-05T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	djzn	well some people apparnatlly have had what I said or whatever the notes were saying
