2012-05-06T22:05:00.000Z	stan_man_can		anyone know of a good article on how to setup sendmail on 11.11?
2012-05-06T22:07:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	what do you want to set it up to do?
2012-05-06T22:07:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	I just need it running so I can make the php mail() function work
2012-05-06T22:08:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	ok should be simple enough - do you have a MTA that will receive and send out your messages or are you just playing locally?
2012-05-06T22:10:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	I'll be sending to third party emails
2012-05-06T22:11:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	thats probably the easiest way. and set your mta to forward mail to a gmail account and such
2012-05-06T22:12:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	then you just point mail() to the localhost and sendmail will handle the rest
2012-05-06T22:13:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	I dont even have sendmail installed yet though. I literally know nothing.
2012-05-06T22:15:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	thats ok - its not that bad - sendmail is annoying - i like postfix - but its cool

2012-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	yes
2012-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	postfix has a way better management interface afaik
2012-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	sendmail is ancient
2012-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	so give me one more second.. ill get a diff articly
2012-05-06T22:19:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/11/11/relaying-postfix-smtp-via-smtpgmailcom/ | for postfix
2012-08-30T23:15:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	those variables are for users
2012-08-30T23:16:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	How do I make it global?
2012-08-30T23:16:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	/etc/profile
2012-08-30T23:19:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	I added EDITOR=vim in the /etc/profile and still opening in nano
2012-08-30T23:19:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	did you export it in profile?
2012-08-30T23:20:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	so in the profile I add the line export EDITOR=vim, not just EDITOR=vim ?
2012-08-30T23:20:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stan_man_can	yes
2012-08-30T23:20:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	Well I may have chosen nano a long time ago but I'd like to change it to vim now
2012-08-30T23:21:00.000Z	stan_man_can	SolarisBoy	export EDITOR=vim didn't help either
