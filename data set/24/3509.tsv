2008-01-24T14:38:00.000Z	crwlr		for what, georgea?
2008-01-24T14:39:00.000Z	crwlr		ahh...i use a different OS for that.  trying to remember the name of it...
2008-01-24T14:40:00.000Z	crwlr		no....genewitch...i cant think of it.  hang on, let me look at my cd
2008-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	crwlr		backtrack 2    genewitch georgea
2008-01-24T14:42:00.000Z	crwlr		there's another one but i'd have to get the name of it and i cant find the cd
2008-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	crwlr		thelynx: none so far...got gutsy on there?
2008-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	yep. gutsy. sadly on a hp laptop with amd64 with ATI radeon graphics
2008-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	crwlr		georgea: i just use the livecd
2008-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	crwlr		thelynx: i have gutsy on a laptop with a p4 and an ati chipset, and i havent had any problems
2008-01-24T14:45:00.000Z	crwlr		georgea: i didnt use vbox for that...hmmm...course i only set it up as a nat network so it wouldn't detect my network adapter
2008-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	everything else works. or well.. the graphics flickers etc etc and fullscreen video is only possible using xine. this due to poor amd drivers. still a known issue I suppose
2008-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	crwlr		what kind of laptop is it, thelynx?
2008-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	hp 6715s
2008-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	crwlr		georgea: very true.  only thing i vbox is winblows...whenever i need to
2008-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	amd64, ati radeon x1250
2008-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	crwlr		thelynx: hmm...which drivers did you install?
2008-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	crwlr		thelynx: ATI and linux go together like...nothing.  ubuntu barely supports ati, so if you installed the restricted drivers and then the effects started happenin...then u gotta remove those
2008-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	the ones from ATI. compiz works but the problem with ctrl+alt+backspace is new to me. been trying to find anything related to the problems on forums, but still confused. does this has something to do with the hibernate issue with ATI and linux?
2008-01-24T14:49:00.000Z	crwlr		hrmmm...
2008-01-24T14:49:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	guess so. do you recommend using the open source driver?
2008-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	can't do much with the hardware. using a laptop from work. otherwise I would returned it
2008-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	crwlr		thelynx: i dont recommend when it comes to ati.  i had an ati in my desktop, and i got ticked off at it cause the effects wouldn't work.  so...i ditched ati and went with nvidia.  you will just have to check wikis and google variations of your problems because i'm not an expert with that
2008-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	crwlr	extern	ATI and UBUNTU don't mix well
2008-01-24T14:51:00.000Z	TheLynx	crwlr	ok. thanks anyway. it's just too bad with the ATI and linux issue. never had any major hardware/driver related problems before
