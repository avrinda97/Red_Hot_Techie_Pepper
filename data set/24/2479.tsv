2008-12-07T06:26:00.000Z	tiyowan		tsrk...I think you want to use the recovery console?
2008-12-07T06:26:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	the windows one?
2008-12-07T06:26:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	ok, thanks
2008-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	You know what the best thing would be?
2008-12-07T07:04:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Um...did this NTLDR msg start to show up right after you installed Ubuntu?
2008-12-07T07:05:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	no, I erased my recovery partition which I no longer needed, forgetting that I had installed some boot stuff to it
2008-12-07T07:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	I think you'll need to get rid of grub to fix this one. Better to nuke grub, fix this problem, then reinstall grub.
2008-12-07T07:06:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	that's what fixmbr from the recovery cd did, but it still didn't fix the error, just "nuked" grub
2008-12-07T07:06:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Ok hold on.

2008-12-07T07:08:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	You need to be a bit careful doing this.
2008-12-07T07:11:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	ribatejo, I found a NTLDR file on my xp recovery CD, should I just copy that over?
2008-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	what?
2008-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Just use testdisk.
2008-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	what's that do?
2008-12-07T07:12:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	It's a utility you run off a cd or usb stick.
2008-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	It'll automatically scan and fix your drive.
2008-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	It also happens when you have a lot of files on your root drive.
2008-12-07T07:13:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Sometimes the MFT gets pushed around.
2008-12-07T07:15:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Actually, ignore my earlier advice, the best thing in my opinion would be to run testdisk. It's bundled with many boot recovery packages. And even linux distros. In fact, I used Parted Magic today to recover my partition table. I got a bit carried away with the Create New Partition Table option.
2008-12-07T07:16:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	isn't testdisk for recovering deleted partitions?
2008-12-07T07:17:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	No. It does a lot of other stuff as well.
2008-12-07T07:17:00.000Z	tsrk	tiyowan	I looked at it and I don't think it would really help because nothing about the file systems or partitions is messed up
2008-12-07T07:19:00.000Z	tiyowan	tsrk	Up to you. You could try this: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-727533.html
