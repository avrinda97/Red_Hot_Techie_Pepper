2008-05-06T05:20:00.000Z	randomoutburst		i was going to install 8.04 and during the partition process i got confused and instead of splitting my hard drive into two partions i made it into one 20gig partition so now windows wont boot, i download testdisk so i just write testdisk MBR code to first sector?
2008-05-06T05:21:00.000Z	randomoutburst		? would that fix the problem?
2008-05-06T05:21:00.000Z	randomoutburst		or do i need to completely repair the NTFS master file table?
2008-05-06T05:23:00.000Z	randomoutburst		? any help?
2008-05-06T05:25:00.000Z	randomoutburst		does anyone know what i should do about my partition?
2008-05-06T05:25:00.000Z	randomoutburst		anyone familiar with testdisk?
2008-05-06T05:27:00.000Z	randomoutburst		im really not sure, when i run the ubuntu live cd it just shows a 20 gig drive, which its actually 40, but i boot into windows
2008-05-06T05:28:00.000Z	randomoutburst		*i cant boot into windows
