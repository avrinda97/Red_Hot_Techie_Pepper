2012-08-31T13:19:00.000Z	geekgirl		hello can  i ask for some help in here about installing wireless
2012-08-31T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	as long as its under ubuntu, yes
2012-08-31T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	what wifi chip are you using?
2012-08-31T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	still doesn't tell us the wifi chip
2012-08-31T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	then why are you reaching for ndisgtk, there may be a native driver!
2012-08-31T13:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	why would you want or need to if there is a Linux driver for it for Linux. Why would you need to bother
2012-08-31T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	if you run:  sudo lshw -C network      you should see what wifi chip it is
2012-08-31T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	yes, but what is the product line
2012-08-31T13:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	press CTRL+ALT+T and run:  sudo lshw -C network
2012-08-31T13:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	ok and run:  lspci    one line will identify the device
2012-08-31T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	try:   sudo modprobe r816
2012-08-31T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	wait, that's an ethernet controller, not wireless
2012-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	yes but the wifi is having the issue...
2012-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	can you run:  lspci -n; lsb_release -a; uname -a     and go to http://pastie.org  and put all the text there
2012-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	we don't know the wifi chip, so it may not be needed
2012-08-31T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	once you hit paste, copy the new address in the address bar and paste the URL here

2012-08-31T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	don't you think you should get something a bit more fundamental setup, like your wireless connectivity....
2012-08-31T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	while you read, run:  sudo apt-get install arduino
2012-08-31T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	all ok now?
2012-08-31T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	wifi all working?
2012-08-31T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	the modprobe command will succeed (no output)
2012-08-31T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	geekgirl	you don't need the .inf
