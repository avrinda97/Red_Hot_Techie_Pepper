2005-11-08T16:14:00.000Z	sunshine82	penguinbrat	so whay did that just happen
2005-11-08T16:14:00.000Z	penguinbrat	sunshine82	it sounds like the app you are running, is triggering some bug in X that is killing it, and it simply restarts...
2005-11-08T16:16:00.000Z	sunshine82	penguinbrat	ok thaks
2005-11-08T16:16:00.000Z	penguinbrat	sunshine82	are you doing this through wine? I had a probelm with wine killing the X server on the last coupld of versions - but I thought it was just my funky setup...
2005-11-08T16:17:00.000Z	sunshine82	penguinbrat	no i wasnt doin anything with wine
2005-11-08T16:18:00.000Z	penguinbrat	sunshine82	what was this "icon" you were clicking on?
