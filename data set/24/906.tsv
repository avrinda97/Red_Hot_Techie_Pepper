2011-02-02T22:24:00.000Z	denisesball		can anyone help with figuring out why my laptop runs hot in 10.10? i dont remember this being a problems in earlier version
2011-02-02T22:25:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Open your system monitor and see if something's hogging the CPU
2011-02-02T22:28:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	nothing is using CPU. its constantly 60 degrees or higher http://i.imgur.com/puIJl.jpg
2011-02-02T22:29:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Laptops tend to build up dust and dirt inside, which can slow down fans, thermally insulate hardware, etc. Maybe you need to to get some canned air or a compresser and blow the dust out
2011-02-02T22:30:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	or...
2011-02-02T22:30:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	g_0_0: i actually just took this whole laptop apart to replace the hinges. inside was pretty clean and im pretty sure it started after moving to 10.10
2011-02-02T22:30:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Maybe your CPU is on "performance"?
2011-02-02T22:30:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	where do i set that?
2011-02-02T22:31:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Easiest way to set it is to put a CPUFreq applet on your panel for each core.
2011-02-02T22:31:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	it's set to on demand
2011-02-02T22:32:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	should i try conservative?
2011-02-02T22:32:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Go for it
2011-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Though at 97% idle, it shouldn't make a difference...
2011-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	doesnt seem to be helping, man this has been driving me nuts for months
2011-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	also, it doesnt run hot it windows
2011-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	What is your current/max CPU freq?
2011-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	where do i see that?
2011-02-02T22:34:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	If you have that CPUFreq applet, hover over to see current, click to see a list of possivle Frequencies
2011-02-02T22:35:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	possible*
2011-02-02T22:35:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	it says 1GHz but goes up to 2GHz, but is set to ondemand setting
2011-02-02T22:36:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	I can see no reason for your computer to run hot, then
2011-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	Unless it's your GPU causing the heat
2011-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	undecim	denisesball	But with 97% idle on CPU, that's unlikely.
2011-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	denisesball	undecim	yeah me neither. ive been trying to figure it out for months. i have compiz and everything disabled, its intel graphics
