2005-10-24T15:26:00.000Z	dragonkh		hello
2005-10-24T15:26:00.000Z	dragonkh		im struggling with apache and php4 - I cant get php to work in apache
2005-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	dragonkh		I had php4 and I then apt-got php5 then found it brokoe my software - so went back to php4 - but now php doesnt work - thinks php is a downloadable file
2005-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	dragonkh		I heard it was quite complex to get it working though - so I might need to re-install ?
2005-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	that means you've misconfigured apache
2005-10-24T15:29:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	 - I have the line in that does the .php bit
2005-10-24T15:29:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	is the php4 module enabled?
2005-10-24T15:29:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	read /var/log/apache2/error.log
2005-10-24T15:30:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- looking
2005-10-24T15:31:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- thers no errors in the error log
2005-10-24T15:32:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- how to enable the module ?
2005-10-24T15:32:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	I'm not asking about errors, read it again
2005-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	do you see a mention of php in there?
2005-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- I read the error.log  - nothing in it
2005-10-24T15:37:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	that's unlikely to help
2005-10-24T15:38:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- it will install it again default - which was working ok
2005-10-24T15:39:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- I think apache2 + php is broken now for my machine
2005-10-24T15:39:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	ok
2005-10-24T15:39:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	reinstalling is unlikely to help
2005-10-24T15:39:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- you think its broken even if I re-install ?
2005-10-25T16:05:00.000Z	dragonkh	bob2	- where do I put a LoadModule command for php ?
2005-10-25T16:05:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	I don't do php, sorry
2005-10-25T16:06:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	dude
2005-10-25T16:06:00.000Z	bob2	dragonkh	/etc/apache2/
