2011-04-19T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 its very likely its os-prober seeing some rescue partition or the windows 7 boot partition. I would just ignore it. and not worry about it
2011-04-20T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 i tried it once.. it dident work. :)
2011-04-20T17:05:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	why didn't it work?
2011-04-20T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 i installed it.. it dident work.. so i went back to grub2..
2011-04-20T17:07:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	I want to install it on my system but was wondering if there were any risks i should know about before doing it.
2011-04-20T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 worse case.. system wont boot..
2011-04-20T17:08:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	then i would have to simply repair grub from live cd? or what would i fix that scenario
2011-04-20T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 yep. live cd, chroot in, reinstall grub2 or somthing like that.
2011-04-20T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 you would have to remove burg i imagine.. and reinstall grub2.. i dont recall how i did it
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 sticking with nvidia, but not the 'just came out yesterday' nvidia cards seems to workbest for me. get their  cards that have been out for a few months.
2011-05-08T14:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 nvidia definatly.  my 8800 works very well.
2011-05-08T14:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 but im not even sure what exist in agp anuy more.
2011-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	do you use open source or proprietary? Which is all around, better?
2011-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 i use the nvidia drivers for all my nvidia systems
2011-05-22T15:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 some times it wont switch till you log out/back in
2011-05-22T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 as a test. you could chantge the setting and restart the X server also.
2011-05-22T15:30:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	do you know the exact command for that? :)
2011-05-22T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 sudo service gdm restart will FORCE X to restart ...
2011-05-22T15:35:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	I tried restarting x. not successful :(
2011-05-22T15:35:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	do you think it might have to do with compiz?
2011-05-22T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 no idea. I rarely mess with the pointer.
2011-05-22T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 try metacity --replace   and see if it works
2011-05-22T15:37:00.000Z	uabn93	Dr_Willis	Ahh. Also, the appearance>theme tab icons look all screwy. Do you think I can just reinstall that program or something?
2011-05-22T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	uabn93	 you can tweak themes all you wwant.. 'reinstalling' is windows thinking.
