2010-09-10T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	the less vague you are, the easier we can help you.
2010-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	have you read my paste?
2010-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	yes.
2010-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	so you don't know how to solve the problem
2010-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	I cannot help you if you don't answer my questions, no
2010-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	i answered you :)
2010-09-10T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	k
2010-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	i'm following a tutorial to install a software, but make command show me errors in the paste
2010-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	look, I can't help you if you don't answer my question.  If you don't want to tell me what you are compiling for whatever reason, ask the channel for help
2010-09-10T16:32:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	i'm compiling a configuration for a software called NEMO, the configuration is called ORCA2_LIM
2010-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	you read its documentation and made sure you had the required dependencies.  Do you have a link for this project?
2010-09-10T16:34:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	yes but you must log in to see the documentation
2010-09-10T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	honestly the errors look like bugs.  Did you try contacting the project (forums, mailing list, their own irc channel, whatever?)
2010-09-10T16:37:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	do you think that these are errors in fortran programming?
2010-09-10T16:37:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	well they say you need to pass the -fwhateveryourpastebinsays switch to (I guess) gfortran
2010-09-10T16:38:00.000Z	HiddenHeroDH	jrib	is it an error on gfortran option?
2010-09-10T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	HiddenHeroDH	it looks like that switch needs to be passed, your best bet is contacting upstream support
