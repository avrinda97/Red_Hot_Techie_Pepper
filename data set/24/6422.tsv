2005-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	alsyr		hi everybody. i am new to ubuntu and i am having difficulty in installing it on an emachines desktop. has anybody got the same problem ? if so, how did you solve it ?
2005-10-19T10:02:00.000Z	alsyr		hi ColonelKernel, thanks for responding.
2005-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	alsyr		i have an emachines t6412. ubuntu installs without any problem. past the login screen, on the splash screen, X hangs completely and freezes the computer
2005-10-19T10:04:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	you need to run memtest
2005-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	whats the install problem
2005-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	reboot, type in memtest at the prompt, if you can figure out how, run the extensive test, it sounds like youve got a memory error
2005-10-19T10:27:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	i ran memtest from the boot menu. is the same as running it from the prompt ?
2005-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	yes, do the extended test
2005-10-19T10:33:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	Is that memory error possible ? knoppix seems to run fine on the computer.
2005-10-19T10:42:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	any idea how long memtest takes ?
2005-10-19T10:42:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	ok :)
2005-10-19T10:43:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	it depends on the CPU
2005-10-19T10:45:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	ok
2005-10-19T12:14:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	memtest has been running for 14 hours now and no errors are reported
2005-10-19T12:15:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	what speed is your CPU
2005-10-19T12:16:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	2,189 Mz
2005-10-19T12:16:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	it is an athlon 64
2005-10-19T12:16:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	what video card are you using?
2005-10-19T12:17:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	ati radeon xpress 200
2005-10-19T12:17:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	what video driver are you using right now?
2005-10-19T12:18:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	should i stop memtest ? ati, from what i can read on xorg.conf
2005-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	alsyr	yeah you should be safe to stop memtest - I would redo my xorg.conf and use the vesa driver until I get the ati driver from ati installed
2005-10-19T12:25:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	to use vesa, should i just change "ati" to "vesa" in xorg.conf or should i do more that that ? if so, what should i do ?
2005-10-19T14:54:00.000Z	alsyr	ColonelKernel	using another graphics card. works fine now. thanks.
