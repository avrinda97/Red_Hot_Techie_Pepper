2006-07-07T12:13:00.000Z	Shizboom		i have a mounted partition with a funny name
2006-07-07T12:13:00.000Z	Shizboom		how do i rename it
2006-07-07T12:14:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	rename the partition or just rename what it is mounted as?
2006-07-07T12:15:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	you should just be able to right click the icon and rename the icon
2006-07-07T12:16:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	hrmm... ooook then
2006-07-07T12:16:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	lemme check something
2006-07-07T12:19:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	i have a suggestion but i don't want to tell you to do it and have something mess up .... :/
2006-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	i was thinking chmod 777 /dev/hda5 and that should allow you to right click and edit the mount name ... or maybe you just need to change you /etc/fstab entry
2006-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	actually ... could you cat /etc/fstab and pastebin it?
2006-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	might be able to do it that way
2006-07-07T12:22:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	k
2006-07-07T12:24:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	ok, just a moment
2006-07-07T12:25:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	^ what dli said
2006-07-07T12:31:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	well the way i was going to do it is have you make a directory inside of /media/ and name it whatever you want the hard drive to be called and then have that be the mount point
2006-07-10T09:45:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	sorry, i just came in ... what you making?
2006-07-10T09:46:00.000Z	rellim	Shizboom	cool cool, functionality?
