2008-11-30T02:01:00.000Z	dime	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu.com/78142/
2008-11-30T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	looks like a disk failure sdf isn't looking good
2008-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	that will happen yes
2008-11-30T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	how full was the data on it ?
2008-11-30T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	interesting, try using --build instead of assemble
2008-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	as it won't be able to "assemble" the current raid 5 with a disk missing
2008-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	or use mdadm to mark a disk as failed
2008-11-30T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	eg: your config still wants 5 disks and you've got 4 - you need to mark one as failed so it knows to expec 4
2008-11-30T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	you "may" get away with it
2008-11-30T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	hence why I asked how full it was
2008-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	your call
2008-11-30T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	doesn't have to be equal as you have the parity stripe,
2008-11-30T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	hence why I said you may get away with it being rebuilt onto the other disks if it's not too full
2008-11-30T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	hm ?
2008-11-30T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	well you have a spare, so only one disk is missing, so if you do a rebuild it should be fine
2008-11-30T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	just issue a rebuild
2008-11-30T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	oops
2008-11-30T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	what happens when you try to start it ?
2008-11-30T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	--manage --run, or --assemble --run
2008-11-30T02:26:00.000Z	ikonia	dime	run fdisk -l /dev/$name on each device make sure they are responding
