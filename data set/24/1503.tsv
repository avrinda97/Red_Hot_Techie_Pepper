2010-06-04T15:15:00.000Z	Diverdude		what does sudo apt-get build-essential contain?
2010-06-04T15:16:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	see --> http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/build-essential
2010-06-04T15:19:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	i see it contains g++  (>= 4:4.3.1) , is it possible to get it with the 4.0.0 version?
2010-06-04T15:21:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	I don't know, you might have to do a little googling to find it :)
2010-06-04T15:25:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	ok, i think i have found a g++ 4.0 package here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/g++-4.0   How do i make it show up in my terminal when using apt-get install?
2010-06-04T15:31:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	Why is it that you need an old version of g++?
2010-06-04T15:31:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	because i need to compile a special type of files called mex files which requires max 4.0
2010-06-04T15:33:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	you are using MATLAB?
2010-06-04T15:33:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	yeah
2010-06-04T15:35:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	have a look here --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB is that roughly what you want?
2010-06-04T15:43:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	that is really nice and useful...but the problem is that i am running matlab2008b
2010-06-04T15:47:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	looks like you might have to explore your MATLAB disk a little and read the 2009 ubuntu docs as well --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB/R2009b. you might be able to piece together an install on that :)
2010-06-04T15:52:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	or you could download gcc 4.0 and install that...
2010-06-04T15:52:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	--> http://gcc.gnu.org/
2010-06-04T15:53:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	but it requires me to compile the compiler right?
2010-06-04T15:53:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	quite possibly
2010-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	so what compiler is used for that?
2010-06-04T15:55:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	have a look at the install docs here --> http://gcc.gnu.org/install/
2010-06-04T16:02:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	heh....the prerequisite list for building the gcc4.0 compiler is extremely long...surely there must be some way of installing a precompiled version of it
2010-06-04T16:12:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	if you download a Ubuntu deb of it it may install, I don't know if it will or not as I have never tried it :)
2010-06-04T16:14:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	ubuntu deb of what? gcc 4.0 ?
2010-06-04T16:14:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	yep
2010-06-04T16:15:00.000Z	Diverdude	mechdave	so where do i find such a ubuntu deb? and what is a ubuntu deb?
2010-06-04T16:16:00.000Z	mechdave	Diverdude	you get them from http://packages.ubuntu.com
