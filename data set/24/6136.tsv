2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	rjb		hi folks, is an AMD Turion a k8?
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	Motoko-chan	rjb	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	rjb	Motoko-chan	and..?
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		Look at the output
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	rjb		wow i sort of guessed I should look at it, but it doesn't answer my question
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		It should say in there somewhere...
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		I don't have an AMD handy to check.
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	rjb		cpu family      : 15
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	rjb		model           : 36
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	rjb		that's what it says
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	rjb		nothing about k8 or k-anything
2006-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	Motoko-chan	rjb	I looked it up and I see that any of the AMD chips supporting 64-bit is a K8
2006-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		The Turion64 is.
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	rjb		ok so linux-image-k8 might work better than linux-image-amd64-generic?
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		Might.
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		You can try and see.
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		Just make sure you can revert.
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	rjb		what i wanna get right is suspend (sleep mode)
2006-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	rjb		my system hangs hard when awaking from sleep
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		I don't know how to do two entries with grub. I'm more used to lilo.
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	Motoko-chan	rjb	you can try checking the wiki.
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	Motoko-chan		Probably one piece of hardware is causing issues.
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	rjb	Motoko-chan	did that but no answer found
2006-01-12T17:00:00.000Z	Motoko-chan	rjb	sorry, I don't know then. Maybe someone else does.
