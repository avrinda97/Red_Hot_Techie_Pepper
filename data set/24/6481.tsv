2005-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	tritium	matw	?
2005-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	matw	tritium	the xorg server calls some  xfree86 stuff. see /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-11-10T10:05:00.000Z	tritium	matw	indeed, I've never noticed that before
2005-11-10T10:05:00.000Z	matw	tritium	neither did I, but I'm debugging X stuff right now. :)
2005-11-10T10:05:00.000Z	tritium	matw	:)
2005-11-10T10:18:00.000Z	matw	tritium	what is tha URL for the ati wiki page?
2005-11-10T10:19:00.000Z	matw	tritium	thanks! I have to take notes
2005-11-10T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	matw	:)
2005-11-10T10:41:00.000Z	matw	tritium	magpie is runing dpkg-reconfigure
2005-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	matw	yes, you rarely need to reboot
2005-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	matw	tritium	the wiki suggests rebooting
2005-11-10T11:13:00.000Z	tritium	matw	you can simply restart gdm (sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart)
2005-11-10T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	matw	there is a kernel module in l-r-m, and an X.org driver in the other package
2005-11-10T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	matw	you need both
2005-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	tritium	matw	you should be able to modprobe it
2005-11-10T11:41:00.000Z	tritium	matw	do you use sudo?
2005-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	tritium	matw	you don't want to do that anyway
2005-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	matw	tritium	did you see the error I got when I tried sudo modprobe fglrx?
2005-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	tritium	matw	yes
2005-11-10T11:50:00.000Z	tritium	matw	that's likely the problem.
2005-11-10T11:51:00.000Z	tritium	matw	that would have been good information to share with us earlier ;)
2005-11-10T11:51:00.000Z	tritium	matw	okay, fair enough
2005-11-10T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	matw	bugzilla
