2005-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	what happens when you type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2005-09-29T14:41:00.000Z	Cryptid	pont	No it loads the begging and then its ask me to login(not the graphical interface) like in Terminal and then it shows user@ubuntu$ and then i am stuck in terminal mode only
2005-09-29T14:41:00.000Z	Cryptid	pont	i didnt try this type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start will this command work
2005-09-29T14:42:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	GDM is the graphical login
2005-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	could be that your xorg.conf has been changed and wont work
2005-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	Cryptid	pont	I dont get the GDM login at all and thats the problem how do i fix it
2005-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	Cryptid	pont	ya u may be rite xorg.conf file may be changed i am new to linux and i dont know how to reverse it can u help me
2005-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	well it could also mean the damoen isn't loading just try /etc/init.d/gdm start and see if gdm starts
2005-09-29T14:44:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	if the xorg.conf has changed the only advise i can really give is to type X and see what the error messgae is
2005-09-29T14:45:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	someones going to have to see the error from X to fix the problem
2005-09-29T14:45:00.000Z	Cryptid		pontu, i typed X and this screen comes up and shows a funny 4 cornered mouse and a 8-bit graphic screen
2005-09-29T14:46:00.000Z	Cryptid		pontu, i mean only the screen is there and nothing else
2005-09-29T14:46:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	ok press ctrl-alt and backspace at the same time and that screen will disapear, your xorg.conf is fine
2005-09-29T14:47:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	what happens if you just type 'gdm' or /etc/init.d/xdm start
2005-09-29T14:48:00.000Z	Cryptid		pontu, ya i also pressed the zlt-ctrl+bkspance and i came back to the previous screen but some diffrent lines i observed sayin that some graphic couldnt be loaded or some thing like that
2005-09-29T14:48:00.000Z	Cryptid		pontu, i didnt try typing gdm or /etc/init/d/xdm start
2005-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	Cryptid		pontu, do u want me to try running these commands
2005-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	pont	Cryptid	yea try that ?
