2009-11-14T08:04:00.000Z	shogun_		Ok, so I'm in my new Ubuntu Netbook Remix install, and it's kind of a shock to the system (I'm coming from years of Gentoo with Enlightenment...only thing that starts up is xclock!)
2009-11-14T08:04:00.000Z	shogun_		is this something I can 'fix' or is this just how it is, and I should maybe drop back to normal Ubuntu?
2009-11-14T08:05:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	I don't really understand your problem. You only get the clock to boot?
2009-11-14T08:06:00.000Z	shogun_		heh, no, no.....on my main desktop and laptop I run pretty minimalist (gentoo with enlightenment), and now I'm in netbook remix and it's like *BOOM! Stuff!!*
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	It's pretty awesome.. Running it as we speak on my mini netbook
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	shogun_		and I'm not sure I'm ready for all this stuff...is this something I can tone down, or is this just now netbook remix 'is' and maybe I should fall back to normal Ubuntu?
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	shogun_		Yeah, I can see why people would like it
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	You can remove programs etc..
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	shogun_		can I change window manager?
2009-11-14T08:07:00.000Z	jolaren		sure, but how big is your screen?
2009-11-14T08:08:00.000Z	shogun_		10.1"  I think if I poke around a bit, get rid of everything, and set up keybindings to launch things, I'll be alright
2009-11-14T08:08:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	Then you'll love it.. open up firefox.. see how it melts in the panel
2009-11-14T08:08:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	Theres so much space for everythin else
2009-11-14T08:09:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	For me it was love at first sight
2009-11-14T08:09:00.000Z	shogun_		Yeah, it's cool looking, it's just not how I"m used to working :D
2009-11-14T08:11:00.000Z	shogun_	arand	well yeah, maybe, but I wanted to try out Ubuntu rather than do another Gentoo box...figured it'd play nicer out of the box with the netbook hardware (and so far it has!)
2009-11-14T08:12:00.000Z	shogun_		Think I'll try it for a few days
2009-11-14T08:12:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	why not install the desktop version and customize it the way you want?
2009-11-14T08:13:00.000Z	shogun_		heh, because I bought a netbook and went 'ooh, a distro meant for netbooks'
2009-11-14T08:13:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	If your into google stuffs try gOS out, pretty neat to
2009-11-14T08:14:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	Really sweet appeance
2009-11-14T08:21:00.000Z	shogun_		oh, I just installed pidgin
2009-11-14T08:22:00.000Z	shogun_		er....not sure. what's the notifier icon?
2009-11-14T08:25:00.000Z	jolaren	shogun_	out of curiousity, what programs r u gettin?
