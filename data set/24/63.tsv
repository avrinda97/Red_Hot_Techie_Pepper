2012-09-12T01:30:00.000Z	d00durk00l		I have a large file 3.2gb that I wish to send to a friend (I don't have a addy to send it to via snailmail).  I am looking to scp a file to him but he is using a Win7 box.. I was thinking of using winspc but I don't want to setup a server that he can access all of my files.. What is the easyiest way to do this so I can just send him the file and he can't access anything else without screwing around with permission or opening a new

2012-09-12T01:30:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	you can setup sftp such that only one directory is accessible no?
2012-09-12T01:31:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	so just do that
2012-09-12T01:31:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	google gives me this: http://superuser.com/questions/443640/whats-missing-from-my-sftp-chroot-setup

2012-09-12T01:34:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	Thanks
2012-09-12T01:38:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	more or less
2012-09-12T01:39:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	it's useful for doing stuff like fixing your OS from a live cd
2012-09-12T01:40:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	it's hard to explain, sometimes you want your environment to act as if the root directory is somewhere new
2012-09-12T01:41:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	something like that, yes
2012-09-12T01:41:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	So why would a distro require you to do this on bootup?
2012-09-12T01:42:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	anyway, people sometimes use it as a security thing too
2012-09-12T01:42:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	Sorry just want to understand
2012-09-12T01:42:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	on install
2012-09-12T01:42:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	some distros have a much more "hands on" install procedure
2012-09-12T01:42:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	Yeah I used to use slackware about 5 years ago
2012-09-12T01:43:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	anyway, in the context of your problem, what you want to do is chroot your friend when they access your sftp server, so that they can only access files under that root
2012-09-12T01:44:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	Actually using that on bootup as a security mechanism is a good idea.. I will have to look into that
2012-09-12T01:44:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	er, that's not what I was getting at
2012-09-12T01:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	that depends on the protocol...
2012-09-12T01:45:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	pidgin uses libpurple, which supports many protocols
2012-09-12T01:46:00.000Z	Nisstyre	d00durk00l	then use the IP over Avian protocol like gordonjcp suggested
2012-09-12T01:58:00.000Z	d00durk00l	Nisstyre	Thanks for the help :)
