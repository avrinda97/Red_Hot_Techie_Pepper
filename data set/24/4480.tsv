2007-08-24T11:38:00.000Z	MTecknology		Is there any freeware I can use to set up a site that will allow me securely transfer files to somebody else. I mean like, I log in and upload the files, then somebody else logs in that is allowed to download them can grab those files.
2007-08-24T11:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	yeah there is a PHP site that allows logins.
2007-08-24T11:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	it's a file browser type website.
2007-08-24T11:39:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	I want to host it on our servers.
2007-08-24T11:39:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	it will be able to do exactly what you're looking for, let me try to remember it's name.
2007-08-24T11:40:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	the php site is open source?
2007-08-24T11:42:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	runs on any PHP enabled web server
2007-08-24T11:42:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	sounds promising - I hope you can remember the name
2007-08-24T11:44:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	it's called relay
2007-08-24T11:45:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	http://ecosmear.com/relay/
2007-08-24T11:46:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	i forgot to mention you need SQL as well.
2007-08-24T11:46:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	you mentioned that
2007-08-24T11:47:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	i used to use it. it's nice. handles archives as well, and if you download multiple files, you can download them all in a zip or something.
2007-08-24T11:48:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	I think that's exactly what i'm looking for
2007-08-24T11:48:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	I assume by sql you mean MySQL
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	or if i read the front it also mentions IIS and mysql :)
2007-08-24T11:49:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	it's pretty snazzy
2007-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	I'm considering setting up a 15G virtual debain server that would host relay
2007-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	why a virtual server?
2007-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	we have an under-utilized server that we just started running virtual servers on... we had no room for more hardware
2007-08-24T11:56:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	sounds good. virtualization is really taking off.
2007-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	MTecknology	recent intel cpus are really killing it as far as virtualization is concerned... zen <--
2007-08-24T11:57:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	we might start running a development server, production server, backtrack2, and now this on it
2007-08-24T11:58:00.000Z	MTecknology	Nubbie	the under-utilized server is capable of 2 dual-core processors and up to 8G RAM for each processor
