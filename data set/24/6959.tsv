2005-06-11T12:43:00.000Z	revelater		because you know nothing can go wrong thats notyour fault you feel intimidated?
2005-06-11T12:43:00.000Z	revelater		:P
2005-06-11T12:45:00.000Z	revelater		ok i just copied my accounting files from my home (ext3) to a floppy (ext2) and the folder in the floppy takes up about 90 bytes less, is that ok?
2005-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	the folder will take up space proportionate to the number of files it has to reference
2005-06-11T12:47:00.000Z	revelater		sorry 90 kilobytes
2005-06-11T12:47:00.000Z	revelater		chanon, thats kind of a non answer
2005-06-11T12:47:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	that was for you^
2005-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	90KB folder is not unusually if you have a lot of files in the folder
2005-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	shanon		unusual
2005-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	but that is a difference between to supposedly exact folders
2005-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	the only difference is that one is ext2 and the other ext3
2005-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	the bigger one is the ext3?
2005-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	yes
2005-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	ext3 is just ext2 with logging. I assume that is the space taken up by the logs. I don't know more about ext3 than that
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	revelater		then it might be considered ok to have a file difference like that
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	In short the extra space is taken up by metadata
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	revelater		thats good enough for now, thank you
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	is it a file or a directory ? I thought you said directory?
2005-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	yes directory
2005-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	OK then yes it is probably what I said
2005-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	i said file when i meant to type size :P
2005-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	revelater	shanon	thanks for the help gnight :)
2005-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	I wouldn't worry about it unless you want to understand ext3 and filesystem internals
2005-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	shanon	revelater	cya
