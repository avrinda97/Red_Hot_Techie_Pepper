2007-07-07T16:21:00.000Z	Bartzy		oh okay tnx
2007-07-07T16:22:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	mount /dev/sda3, then chroot the mount point
2007-07-07T16:23:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	what if I just do : mount /dev/sda3 /
2007-07-07T16:24:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	doubt it will let you, and general it is a bad bad idea
2007-07-07T16:24:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	lol, just did it :\
2007-07-07T16:24:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	mkdir /mnt/foo ; mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/foo ; chroot /mnt/foo
2007-07-07T16:26:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	why can't I umount /dev/sda3 ? I mounted it on / :\
2007-07-07T16:26:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	because now everything is running from the new /
2007-07-07T16:26:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	as I said, bad bad idea
2007-07-07T16:26:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	- so it's good .. it's what I want..
2007-07-07T16:27:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	But what about the old /?
2007-07-07T16:28:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	, so the only solution to me being stupid is restart and load live cd again ?
2007-07-07T16:28:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	yes
2007-07-07T16:28:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	next time use chroot
2007-07-07T16:29:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	Then the use of sda3 is only for that terminal window, not the whole system
2007-07-07T16:29:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	If my grub is bad... I fucked it up... how can I reinstall it ? everything in it... menu.lst... the package itself... I didn't understand that from the docs
2007-07-07T16:31:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	good from live cd, mount linux partitions, chroot, start networking, use apt-get, edit config as necessary
2007-07-07T16:31:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	apt-get install grub-install will delete grub config and make a new one , like in the ubuntu installlation ?
2007-07-07T16:32:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	no idea
2007-07-07T16:32:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	so how do I reinstall grub ? :] 
2007-07-07T16:33:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	no backup menu.lst?
2007-07-07T16:34:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	- nope... I want it to make me a new menu.lst :\
2007-07-07T16:35:00.000Z	Edgan	Bartzy	then just take someone else's as an example and make the necessary changes, it is pretty simple
2007-07-07T16:36:00.000Z	Bartzy	Edgan	Jowi, I'm going to restart my live cd and come back with results :p thank you Edgan
