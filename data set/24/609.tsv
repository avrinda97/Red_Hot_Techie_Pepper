2012-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	Defusal_		in case anyone answered my question while i was timing out, please repaste it
2012-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	Defusal_		because now i have the issue again, and would really like to know why it is happening
2012-03-20T18:10:00.000Z	Defusal_		i don't quite get this, i switched from putty to SecureCRT recently for my windows ssh client, as it got the best ratings. but now with this client, if my connection dies, all processing running in ssh sessions continue in the background, which forces me to kill them manually later to free listening ports and stuff... does anyone have any idea why this would be happening?
2012-03-20T18:11:00.000Z	Defusal_		when the ssh session dies, so do all processes that it is running
2012-03-20T18:12:00.000Z	Defusal_		it breaks ssh's expected behaviour
2012-03-20T18:14:00.000Z	Defusal_		how is it possible to disconnect from a SSHd, without the session dying? i have always assumed this is impossible, but since i now see it is possible, i'd like to know how it can be done, and if it is possible to reconnect to the same session again
2012-03-20T18:16:00.000Z	Defusal_		but i guess maybe a general linux channel will be able to provide an answer, since sshd isnt exactly specific to ubuntu
2012-03-20T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	there are some windows clients that work like screen
2012-03-20T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	they run a daemon and the client connects to that daemon that does the ssh work
2012-03-20T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	I didn't say you where talking about screen
2012-03-20T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	re-read what I said
2012-03-20T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	I said there are some clients that act LIKE screen
2012-03-20T18:18:00.000Z	Defusal_	ikonia	i have not yet responding to you
2012-03-20T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	in that the front end you see isn't actually doing the work , the application daemon is
2012-03-20T18:20:00.000Z	Defusal_	ikonia	i am pretty sure theres no daemon involved
2012-03-20T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	contact the application vendor for an explination
2012-03-20T18:23:00.000Z	Defusal_	ikonia	my question is unrelated to the client, i want to know how sshd possibly allows this
2012-03-20T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	you'll need to know how the client works to understand that
2012-03-20T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	as I said it maybe running a daemon/service as some windows ssh clients do
2012-03-20T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	finding out from the client vendor how it works is the first step
2012-03-20T18:24:00.000Z	Defusal_	ikonia	as i said, im pretty sure theres no daemon, i am looking at my process list now
2012-03-20T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	sorry, I didn't know you could read instead all the applications binaries
2012-03-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	ask the vendor how it works, once they explain how it works you can look at working out if this is a risk or not
2012-03-20T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Defusal_	then ask the client maker how it works and you can work out if it's an ssh security flaw, or just the client doing work for you and it's fine
