2012-11-02T05:29:00.000Z	freetown2		anybody here managed to get iOS 6 devices to print via cups?
2012-11-02T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	can it connect to http printers?
2012-11-02T05:32:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	http printers? nope, it won't 'see' them because they won't advertise image/urf support
2012-11-02T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	you could share the printer with samba, can the OS connect to windows shared printers?
2012-11-02T05:33:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	iOS 6. As in them dumb tablets that do airprinting?
2012-11-02T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	not used one, I refuse  to buy apple products
2012-11-02T05:34:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	yeah, not my choice either. schools here are kinda sold on Apple crap

2012-11-02T05:36:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	ahem, it works with iOS 5 but not with iOS 6 in which Apple has helpfully changed its printing
2012-11-02T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	is it not the same method?
2012-11-02T05:38:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	nope. They now do urf instead of pdf -_-
2012-11-02T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	sounds greeeeeeat

2012-11-02T05:38:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	i had to modify the avahi server files to advertise urf. Yeah, I know. I'd like to black out Infinity Loop
2012-11-02T05:39:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	been there, done that and no go.
2012-11-02T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	you can copy a PDF to the server, then run:  lpr filename.pdf   in an SSH session and it will print
2012-11-02T05:40:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	thanks, I'll tell that to the rest of the school. :-)
2012-11-02T05:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	well if they want to buy proprietary stuff which doesn't play nice with anything but itself, you're gonna get issues
2012-11-02T05:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	could buy an airprint server and hook it up
2012-11-02T05:42:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	heh, did I mention that even cups on Mac OS X has issues?
2012-11-02T05:42:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	ah well, i guess I shall just have to put on a big :-D
2012-11-02T05:43:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	thanks
2012-11-02T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	freetown2	http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i:aps,k:airprint%20print%20server&tag=duckduckgo-d-20    nice and cheap
2012-11-02T05:45:00.000Z	freetown2	ActionParsnip	nevermind, i have in addition to supporting airprinting the need to tracking print jobs and charge them to accounts. I guess I will just have to go MacPro + Papercut and not Ubuntu + Papercut
