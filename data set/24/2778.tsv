2009-11-30T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	disable all security on the router and attempt connection. If it connects then your WEP key is wrong or you are selecting the wrong type of WEP
2009-11-30T15:07:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	nope because it is working on other computers mac and windows.
2009-11-30T15:35:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	any other ideas?
2009-11-30T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	about what?
2009-11-30T15:36:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	my problem
2009-11-30T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	well i gathered you had a problem, can you please remind me was what I was after
2009-11-30T15:38:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	I am trying to connect to wireless internet and this isn't working.  All it does is send me back to the Wireless Network Authentication box after I connect.
2009-11-30T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	does it happen as another user?
2009-11-30T15:39:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	only one this linux box but when I tried in windows it was disconnecting often
2009-11-30T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	then make another, you can have multiple users on the Ubuntu system
2009-11-30T15:40:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	only one
2009-11-30T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	make a new user
2009-11-30T15:42:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	are you sure that will help?
2009-11-30T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	if the new user is ok then it is a bad setting in your current user some place. If the dialogue goes away as normal then the system is fine and your current user settings are bad somewhere
2009-11-30T15:44:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	oh
2009-11-30T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	if the same happens with the new user with clean vanilla settings then you have found a bug as the setting is not isolated to your one user
2009-11-30T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	its called isolating the issue to see where things go wrong and go right so you can narrow down the possibilities until you know what is wrong
2009-11-30T15:45:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	can't we try to work with one user?
2009-11-30T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	if your profile is bad, no matter how many times you try you will always fail, you need to see if its settings or system which are bad
2009-11-30T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	new users are free you know and they can be deleted once used
2009-11-30T15:48:00.000Z	ShawnRisk	ActionParsnip1	I didn't create the user it is the first one made by installation
2009-11-30T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	yes I know, but you can add more
2009-11-30T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ShawnRisk	under administration you can add users there
