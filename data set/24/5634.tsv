2008-06-24T03:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	what sound card do you have?
2008-06-24T03:22:00.000Z	Reaper	dystopianray	as I said, on windows I was facing this problem, until I had to install the Driver - I tried through wine, it didn't work - how can I do install tar.bz2 ?
2008-06-24T03:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	what exactly is it that you are trying to install?
2008-06-24T03:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	and what sound card do you have?
2008-06-24T03:23:00.000Z	Reaper	dystopianray	installing the sound card driver - It's a built-in sound card, with built in speaker for HP Compaq DC5000
2008-06-24T03:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	where did you get this driver from? what driver is it?
2008-06-24T03:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	a tar.bz2 file is an archive format, like a zip file
2008-06-24T03:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	what is the name of the file?
2008-06-24T03:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	and what are the names of those files?
2008-06-24T03:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	ubuntu 8.04 has alsa 1.0.16, they are just older versions of the same driver
2008-06-24T03:27:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	i have no idea, maybe it's a mixer setting you need to adjust
2008-06-24T03:29:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	you don't need to use sudo
2008-06-24T03:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	you'll probably need to play around with the sound mixer to do what you want
2008-06-24T03:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	it sounds like a very card specific problem
2008-06-24T03:32:00.000Z	Reaper	dystopianray	well it worked fine with Windows, when I installed the driver.
2008-06-24T03:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	you already have a driver for your card
2008-06-24T03:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	Reaper	ubuntu has one installed by default
2008-06-24T03:33:00.000Z	Reaper	dystopianray	I see. got it
