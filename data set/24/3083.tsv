2010-11-27T08:46:00.000Z	StrangeCharm		does passwords and encryption keys support hkps?
2010-11-27T08:47:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	I do not believe so
2010-11-27T08:47:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	sigh
2010-11-27T08:48:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	https://bugs.launchpad.net/seahorse/+bug/571297 That seems to be a relevant bug.
2010-11-27T08:50:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	earlier, i asked about firefox and the same app. is there a bug for that too?
2010-11-27T08:51:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	Just FYI, the password manager for Ubuntu is called "Seahorse"
2010-11-27T08:51:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	not something that one can tell from the "inside"
2010-11-27T09:27:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	That'd be an issue with Gnome Panel.
2010-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	I find that happens if I have something like an SSHFS mount which is timing out. It blocks updates to Gnome.
2010-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	what would be some good ways to fix it?
2010-11-27T09:28:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	Determine any mounts you have that are lagging.
2010-11-27T09:29:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	what is an sshfs mount?
2010-11-27T09:29:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	Not something you really need to worry about ;)
2010-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	well, it seems that it is of concern to me at this time, because my gnome panel isn't responding
2010-11-27T09:30:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	My recommendation would be to simply restart X
2010-11-27T09:31:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	how do i make that happen? ctrl-alt-del is mapped to a menu. is there a console command i can use?
2010-11-27T09:32:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	As I said, Ctrl-Alt-Backspace. Not Ctrl-Alt-Delete.
2010-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	ctrl+alt+backspace doesn't do anything
2010-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	Hrmm... That's odd.
2010-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	Might have to do a magic sysrq restart.
2010-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	tell me more?
2010-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
2010-11-27T09:34:00.000Z	FrozenFire	StrangeCharm	The basic of the Magic SysRQ restart is that you hold Alt+SysRQ and then press, slowly, seconds between each key, "R-S-E-I-U-B"
2010-11-27T09:35:00.000Z	StrangeCharm	FrozenFire	i acutally already have a terminal, so i'm going to follow ChaoRhi's instruction and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
