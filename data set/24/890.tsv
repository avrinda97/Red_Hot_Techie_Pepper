2010-11-18T16:49:00.000Z	iram		dqnrrico_: go ahead describe your problem
2010-11-18T16:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	bott into livecd; chrrot to the messed up install and try to finish the failed upgrade ?
2010-11-18T16:51:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	i have no burner nor livecd here, i can access the filesystem from my windows dualbooth though, anything i can do to fix? Other question: How do i determine what is wrong in the boot? i cannot get information about the hangup in the logs
2010-11-18T16:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	:( you do not have the usb key/cd you used to install the system?
2010-11-18T16:53:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	unfortunately not, i am away from home for a week
2010-11-18T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	when the boot process hangs there is no error message in the screen? of any type?
2010-11-18T16:55:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	None, it just hangs at login screen
2010-11-18T16:55:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	and i can't get a shell
2010-11-18T16:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	"syslog" and "messages" are more important logs
2010-11-18T16:58:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	boot.log: init: udevtrigger post-stop process (425) terminated with status 1
2010-11-18T16:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	that does not help much... ( not me at least ) to understand the problem
2010-11-18T17:01:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	sys.log: rsyslogd-2039: Could no open output file '/dev/xconsole'
2010-11-18T17:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	i do not have that device either. so it is not essential to the system. just a warning.
2010-11-18T17:05:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	Do you have any idea how i can troubleshoot the bootup sequence ?
2010-11-18T17:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	you can try editting /boot/grub/grub.cfg and removing quiet and splash from the kernel line you use to boot
2010-11-18T17:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	then reboot and see what messages you get
2010-11-18T17:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	the lines are something similar to « linux   /vmlinuz-2.6.32-26-generic root=UUID=rendom-string-here ro   quiet splash »
2010-11-18T17:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	remove the trailing quiet and splash
2010-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	yes; you did not see anything wrong while booting into it?
2010-11-18T17:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	:/  using « sysrq + t » will dump a trace to console but probably would b e useless to users like us ...
2010-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	i rebooted with alt sysrq didn't know i could get a trace gonna try it
2010-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	do you have any idea why i can't even boot with older linux kernels that were known to work? i have noticed that once before that after installing a new kernel the old one won't boot (hang) this is not what is supposed to happen
2010-11-18T17:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	iram	maybe is some userspace ( vital ) the one that hangs up... init; login. etc... who knows
2010-11-18T17:18:00.000Z	iram	erUSUL	thanks for your help
