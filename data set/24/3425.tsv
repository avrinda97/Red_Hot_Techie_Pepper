2012-09-05T00:43:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	is there a reason you just don't mount the nfs share with fstab?
2012-09-05T00:45:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	yes, because the machine would a) hang waiting b) the server might be not powered off. So, I need manual mount, not fstab mount. Besides, console mount works no problem, its just when I try mounting via my script - by clicking on the link to it, I get three gksudo boxes, instead of just one.
2012-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	you could give the script permissions in the sudoers file
2012-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	sorry what do you mean?
2012-09-05T00:59:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	you can give whatever user needs to run the script sudo access without passwd to run that specific script in the sudoers file. Use visudo to edit the sudoers file
2012-09-05T01:00:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	if you mean I should enable sudo for the user without asking for his password, thats a very bad idea. The thing that search for is to make gksudo (or any sudo-like gfx frontend) to remember the privileges between its calls.
2012-09-05T01:00:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	but thanks anyway!
2012-09-05T01:03:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	no just for the user to run that specific script and only that
2012-09-05T01:03:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	without a password. They would have to provide it for anything else as usual
2012-09-05T01:05:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	that would be an overkill O______________________O
2012-09-05T01:05:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	well you don't wnat to type the password or only type it once?
2012-09-05T01:06:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	i'm confused
2012-09-05T01:08:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	I was saying you could do something in the sudoers file like       randomnick ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/script    then when randomnick runs that script they are not prompted for a password
2012-09-05T01:08:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	I want to be asked for the password only once in my graphical script. To insert this script into sudoers, would mean same as moving shop itself into the house, instead of getting up and going into the shop.
2012-09-05T01:08:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	ahh what about asuming root with the script and then executing it's commands. like sudo -i  in the begining then all commands after that.
2012-09-05T01:09:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	yes, I understood mate, but its incorrect solution... I want to share this script later for everyone, so everyone can have fast NFS mounts in their networks. If they all need to modify their sudoers for it to run, that would be very... wrong. :)
2012-09-05T01:10:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	please see my follow up assuming root with sudo -i in the script and then running commands after that. Although I still don't understand why you are using gksudo on a script.
2012-09-05T01:10:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	you need root-level priviledge for "mount". NFS uses mount to mount network shares.
2012-09-05T01:11:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	but not gksudo  you sh0ould be using sudo
2012-09-05T01:11:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	I would in my script sudo -i  && mkdir somefolder && mount whatever blah
2012-09-05T01:15:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	sudo keeps privileges just fine between calls. If you call sudo several times in the script, it would ask for password just once. However, this is not the case with gksu. So when I call mount, then two daemon restarts, I get three dialogs one after another. And it should be graphical, because console.. is nice. But graphical is better :)
2012-09-05T01:17:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	ntop
2012-09-05T01:18:00.000Z	randomnick	histo	thanks mate
2012-09-05T01:19:00.000Z	histo	randomnick	actually ntop has changed a lot. I'm looking for something that functions the old way it used to
