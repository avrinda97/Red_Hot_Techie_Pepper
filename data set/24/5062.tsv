2006-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	BAzfH		i would be really lucky if i had a ath0 instead of my f*cking ra0
2006-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	BAzfH		there are severals hundred people around having problems with it in edgy
2006-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	BAzfH		with a dozen of possible solutions
2006-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	BAzfH		but none seems to work for me :-(((
2006-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	BAzfH		i'm currently thinking of downloading a dapper iso
2006-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	BAzfH		but it will take so long again:((
2006-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	BAzfH		well... BUT .. edgy is great! real great!
2006-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	BAzfH		it's running fine at work (seems as it wants me to do my work) .. but doesn't at home (it doesn't want me to work at home)
2006-11-04T15:09:00.000Z	BAzfH		heheheh
2006-11-04T15:10:00.000Z	BAzfH		oh.. thats a late start for someone to be my mom
2006-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	georgy	BAzfH	: use ratech drivers and here a tuto in french http://www.bawet.org/article.php3?id_article=136
2006-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	BAzfH		It's like you are going to have a paid girl - after several years of sex drugs and rock'n'roll - but your mom comes up to tell you that you are too young
2006-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	BAzfH	georgy	i tried to use them
2006-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	BAzfH	georgy	doing ifup ra0 after doing through tuts results in a total lockup of my system
2006-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	georgy	BAzfH	: ok, but works great in dapper
2006-11-04T15:12:00.000Z	BAzfH		:-(
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		seems like i really need to invest 2 hours to download it
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		... again
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		okay. i revise my opinion
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		i think: edgy sucks out of hell.
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		;))
2006-11-04T15:13:00.000Z	BAzfH		well then
2006-11-04T15:14:00.000Z	BAzfH		lets download ubuntu (i really *hate* having to say this) dapper and hopefully get happy
2006-11-04T15:14:00.000Z	georgy	BAzfH	: hopoe for you, good luck
