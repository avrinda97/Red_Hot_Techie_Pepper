2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	Fossilet		hi
2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	Fossilet		I am using beryl. But screenshot of a window is boardless.
2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	Fossilet		Why??
2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	Fossilet		OK.
2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	need to enable argbvisuals.
2007-07-07T08:47:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	argbvisuals is...?
2007-07-07T08:47:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	what video card do you have? ati? nvidia?
2007-07-07T08:48:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	what version of ubuntu do you have? 7.04?
2007-07-07T08:54:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	7.04
2007-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	and i use gnome scrennshot
2007-07-07T08:56:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	i'm confused. you do see window borders, but they're not in screenshots?
2007-07-07T08:57:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	yes. They are ok. But screenshot do not have borders :(
2007-07-07T08:57:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	oh. hold on a sec
2007-07-07T08:59:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	ah. yeah, i think that's just a bug in beryl.
2007-07-07T08:59:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	are you using the 0.2 debs? i think it's been fixed in a new version of beryl.
2007-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	yeah, it's definitely been fixed actually. notice you don't get window borders also in previews when you alt+tab.
2007-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	beryl-core 0.2.1 in feisty
2007-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	ah. yeah, it's just because beryl's still beta. rest assured, sooner or later it will be finished :)
2007-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	alt tab prievw is ok.
2007-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	ok. I will wait for gutsy....;)
2007-07-07T09:01:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	hmm. wierd. then maybe it's just an option in the gnome screenshot app. ksnapshot offers me a checkbox that says Window Decorations, is there such a thing for gnome?
2007-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	Fossilet	Vuen	yes, gnome has. even scrot sucks here.
2007-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	hm. ah well, sorry. you can ask in #beryl, they might be able to help.
2007-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	Vuen	Fossilet	make sure that you let them know you do have window borders normally, you're just missing them in screenshots
