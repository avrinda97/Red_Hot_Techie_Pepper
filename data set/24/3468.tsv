2008-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	MaxFrames		hello
2008-12-17T14:23:00.000Z	MaxFrames		can you help me with a network problem?
2008-12-17T14:24:00.000Z	MaxFrames		the problem happened this morning, after installing the latest ubuntu updates and rebooting (I use xubuntu 8.10)...
2008-12-17T14:24:00.000Z	MaxFrames		after rebooting, I noticed an alert sign on the network connections tray icon
2008-12-17T14:25:00.000Z	MaxFrames		if I right click the icon and choose Informations, it says that no valid network connection was found
2008-12-17T14:25:00.000Z	MaxFrames		yet I seem to be able to use the network, ifconfig returns valid data and I can surf the web
2008-12-17T14:26:00.000Z	MaxFrames		the alert sign, the "no valid network connection" alert, show something is wrong
2008-12-17T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	ok, can you ping your routers ip?
2008-12-17T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	can you ping 74.125.47.104
2008-12-17T14:28:00.000Z	MaxFrames	ActionParsnip	no I can't ping that IP
2008-12-17T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	can you do: nslookup www.google.com
2008-12-17T14:29:00.000Z	MaxFrames	ActionParsnip	yes, it resolves
2008-12-17T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	then dns is ok but your connection is bad outside your lan, can you reboot router and modem (if its external to the router) leave both off a few seconds
2008-12-17T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	not a clue, i dont use gnome
2008-12-17T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	but ips are resolving but no ping
2008-12-17T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	can you instal traceroute from your install cd and run a traceroute to web sites
2008-12-17T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	have you set your default gateway?
2008-12-17T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	sudo ip route add default via <your routers ip address>
2008-12-17T15:12:00.000Z	MaxFrames	ActionParsnip	I can surf the web, but network manager says "unmanaged device"
2008-12-17T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MaxFrames	then who cares, just close it and get on with life
