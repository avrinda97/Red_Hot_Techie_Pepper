2007-09-04T11:01:00.000Z	Daverocks	lostboyz	if your router is also your gateway, then do "route -n" and look at what the default gateway is
2007-09-04T11:02:00.000Z	lostboyz		so is it in gateway or destination?
2007-09-04T11:03:00.000Z	Daverocks	lostboyz	gateway
2007-09-04T11:03:00.000Z	lostboyz		yeah when i put that address in it asks for password and login which i have never set before
