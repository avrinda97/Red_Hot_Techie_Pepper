2012-04-30T12:42:00.000Z	phpN00b_		I need to run a windows software (no, it doesn't work with wine), but I would like to have Ubutu as my main os because I don't trust Windows. Is there a way to have a clean environment to do this?
2012-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	a virtual machine could work
2012-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	that is what I am doing right now...
2012-04-30T12:44:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	what are you having trouble with?
2012-04-30T12:44:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	it is very slow in the VM
2012-04-30T12:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	what are the specs (cpu & ram) of the computer?
2012-04-30T12:45:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	i7 with 8gb of ram
2012-04-30T12:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	unless you are running a flight simulator, virtualbox shouldn't be runnig slowly on that much hardware!
2012-04-30T12:46:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	what application is it you are trying to use? Also, is it just the application that is slow, or windows itself in the virtual machine?
2012-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	windows itslef is slow
2012-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	the interface lags
2012-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	what version of windows are you running and how much ram did you allocate to the virtual machine?
2012-04-30T12:47:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	win 7 ultimate with 4GB of ram
2012-04-30T12:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	run the windows 7 performance tool and post a screenshot of the results (should look like http://www.chotocheeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/win7_q6600_650_sli_8400_02.jpg )
2012-04-30T12:51:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	windows can not do the performance test in the vm
2012-04-30T12:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	check in the virtualbox settings to see if hardware acceleration is enabled, if your computer doesn't support it, you will have to turn off Aero in windows
2012-04-30T12:55:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	it is turned on. and my cpu does support virtualization
2012-04-30T12:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	the only other thing I can recommend is turning off the win7 special effects. anything beyond that and you'll have to ask the guys in #windows
2012-04-30T12:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	you could also dual-boot if that works better for you
2012-04-30T12:57:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	I am considering that..
2012-04-30T13:01:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	thanks for the help. I think I will replace Ubuntu with Windows with virus scanner and encryption.
2012-04-30T13:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	just out of curiosity, what application is it that you need windows for (we are always curious as to what apps linux is lacking)
2012-04-30T13:13:00.000Z	phpN00b_	DarwinSurvivor	it is chat client for trading..
2012-04-30T13:15:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	phpN00b_	ah, never worked with those. I know lots of trading *servers* run linux, but not sure about clients.
