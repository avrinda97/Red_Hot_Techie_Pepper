2010-08-05T17:18:00.000Z	imanc		does anyone know why I can't ssh into my server with thsi new user (is it to do with the shell or group?)  externalaccess:x:1005:1006::/home/externalaccess:/bin/sh
2010-08-05T17:20:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Whats happening when you try?
2010-08-05T17:21:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	I'm getting permission denied.  I have set the pwd twice with usermod -p pass externaluser
2010-08-05T17:23:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Does that user's home directory exist?
2010-08-05T17:23:00.000Z	imanc		pico - probably not
2010-08-05T17:23:00.000Z	imanc		adding now
2010-08-05T17:25:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	 still no dice, odd.
2010-08-05T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Can you add the -v argument to ssh and see if the error is coming out of ssh or that user's shell?
2010-08-05T17:26:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	OK
2010-08-05T17:27:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	it is saying: debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
2010-08-05T17:27:00.000Z	imanc		Permission denied, please try again.
2010-08-05T17:27:00.000Z	imanc		what is freaking me out
2010-08-05T17:27:00.000Z	imanc		is i have created loads of accounts nad had no issues before
2010-08-05T17:28:00.000Z	imanc		doing to try a basic pwd now
2010-08-05T17:28:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	I just changed the pwd with: usermod -p testing externalaccess
2010-08-05T17:29:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Can you check /var/log/auth.log , perhaps theres something relevant logged there.
2010-08-05T17:29:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	OK
2010-08-05T17:30:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	Aug  5 13:29:29 localhost sshd[2557]: Failed password for externalaccess from 81    <- mostly that. So wtf
2010-08-05T17:34:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	it was usermod -p that didnt' work. passwd externalaccess worked fine. Hmm.]
2010-08-05T17:34:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Can you change that user's password with passwd instead of usermod?  I'm looking through the usermod manpage and it looks like it expects an encrypted password there.
2010-08-05T17:34:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Yes, that :)
2010-08-05T17:34:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	yeh, figured it'd want the pwd pre-encrypted
2010-08-05T17:34:00.000Z	imanc	Pici	I'm sure I have been here before. Doh! Thanks for your help!
2010-08-05T17:35:00.000Z	Pici	imanc	Sure.
