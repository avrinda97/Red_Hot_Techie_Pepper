2009-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	howsthat	Wine maybe, but might have to configire it, if not well  a Windows virtual machine with enough RAM
2009-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!wine |  howsthat
2009-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!virtualbox |  howsthat
2009-11-17T10:01:00.000Z	howsthat		thanks again. would virtualbox or wine be preferable, or is it kind of trial and error?
2009-11-17T10:01:00.000Z	howsthat		really!!! great!!!
2009-11-17T10:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	howsthat	non free meaning it's not  opensource/freesoftware   not  free as in not free as in freedom.   with the source code being available to the general public.  Two version of Virtualbox the  non free with USB support and the open source version without it.

2009-11-17T10:03:00.000Z	howsthat		no problem, i just wanted to make sure I could still run sibelius. I think if i can remote desktop and run sibelius, everything else should be fine. I once tried ubuntu, but got nervous because I couldn[t see my C: drive. Is there some way to view all disk drives while running ubuntu?
2009-11-17T10:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!freedom > howsthat

2009-11-17T10:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	howsthat	Since Ubuntu 7.10 (October 2007) Ubuntu has been able to read and write to Windows NTFS no problem, as long as Windows was shut down properly
2009-11-17T10:05:00.000Z	howsthat	displaced	so if i understand there will be some way for me to view all files on my disk drives under ubuntu, right?
2009-11-17T10:05:00.000Z	howsthat		yes
2009-11-17T10:06:00.000Z	howsthat		great
2009-11-17T10:06:00.000Z	howsthat		i am getting so sick of this vista machine
2009-11-17T10:06:00.000Z	howsthat		i have had two periods in the last two nights, where the hard drive is going so crazy I can't get the machine to do anything
2009-11-17T10:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	howsthat	crazy in what kind of way?  if your hard disk is failing putting another OS on it, probably won't do much good
