2009-09-09T12:18:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	And RAM?
2009-09-09T12:07:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	What do you mean?
2009-09-09T12:08:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	Ubuntu is... well, Ubuntu. Other things, such as DE, are decided by your preference.
2009-09-09T12:08:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	As for Ultima Online... most people report good results in Wine, but that's no guarantee.
2009-09-09T12:08:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	Correct.
2009-09-09T12:09:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=228
2009-09-09T12:09:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	It does. I suggest downloading 9.04 (the latest stable version) and trying that out
2009-09-09T12:09:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	Like I said, most people report really good results on UO, so I'd give that a go in Wine.
2009-09-09T12:10:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	It might, might not. UO has pretty low sys requirements, though.
2009-09-09T12:16:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	How much disk space do you have you wish to use for Ubuntu?
2009-09-09T12:16:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	(in total)
2009-09-09T12:17:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	It really depends on how much space you have in total.
2009-09-09T12:17:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	If you had a figure for that, it'd be easier to give you a recommendation.
2009-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	10G /, 2G swap, rest for /home. That's my recommendation.
2009-09-09T12:19:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	You probably won't use up those 10G, but that's to make sure you have enough space to fit basically what you want on it. Generally, swap should be RAMx2, but you have plenty.
2009-09-09T12:20:00.000Z	MenZa	G-man	And /home... well, that takes up space.
