2006-04-21T05:49:00.000Z	mirak		on dapper
2006-04-21T05:51:00.000Z	mirak		Drac[Server] : I remember having it working in July
2006-04-21T05:51:00.000Z	mirak		well I installed following that procedure : ---> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide#Method_1:_Installing_Dapper.27s_Included_Driver_.288.23.7.29
2006-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	mirak		the joke is that now there is not even a TV OUT control showing on the control panel
2006-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	mirak		the drivers have lost TV out
2006-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	jadaz87	mirak	does it work on breezy?
2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	I don't know I used it only in october
2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	at laest it was working. I think the switch to xorg killed everything
2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	mirak		or the ati update
2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	mirak		don't know
2006-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	jadaz87	mirak	what did you do to enable it just plug in the tvout port on your laptop?
2006-04-21T05:54:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	it's a desktop computer

2006-04-21T05:54:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	that's a tower
2006-04-21T05:54:00.000Z	jadaz87	mirak	oh ok why did they switch from xorg ?
2006-04-21T05:54:00.000Z	mirak		with a radeon 9600
2006-04-21T05:55:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	xorg is the linux server now. They forked from Xfree
2006-04-21T05:59:00.000Z	jadaz87	mirak	what is wrong with xfree?
2006-04-21T06:00:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	don't know
2006-04-21T06:00:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	tensions
2006-04-21T06:00:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	xfree was not only used for linux
2006-04-21T06:01:00.000Z	jadaz87	mirak	does xorg even have a website?
2006-04-21T06:02:00.000Z	mirak	jadaz87	yes
