2011-10-11T06:49:00.000Z	mmoebius	ryannathans	what is about (current) 11.04 ? Maybe something specific to your system got fixed ?
2011-10-11T06:49:00.000Z	ryannathans	mmoebius	i'm having problems with the 11.04, can't get it to start
2011-10-11T06:52:00.000Z	mmoebius	ryannathans	If the ubuntu kernel is to b0rked for you, roll your own. If installing from an USB key, you should be abel to supply your own kernel, modules etc. with a little work
2011-10-11T06:53:00.000Z	mmoebius	ryannathans	does anything not ubuntu boot on your system ? Think  http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html

2011-10-11T06:55:00.000Z	mmoebius	ryannathans	I mean, just for seeing another kernel do stuff ... or not to see it. Ist hardware-failure an option ? Did you already run memtest for a few hours ?
2011-10-11T06:55:00.000Z	ryannathans	mmoebius	it's DEFINATELY not hardware problem
2011-10-11T06:56:00.000Z	ryannathans	mmoebius	10.04 is being written to a usb right now
