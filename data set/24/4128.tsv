2007-07-06T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	There are programs to strip the DRM off of itunes music
2007-07-06T06:01:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	I tried that 'playfair' (hymn) one and it didn't seem to work, could you recommend one or is that against policy?
2007-07-06T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	I don't think it is against policy ( since you are doing for fair use ) but I don't have any more information
2007-07-06T06:03:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	ok,. thanks
2007-07-07T06:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	That is available in the Universe repository
2007-07-07T06:57:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	in feisty?
2007-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	yup
2007-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	hmm, lemme see :)
2007-07-07T06:59:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	I *thought* it was enabled - in preferences I have "Community-maintained Open Source software (Universe)" enabled
2007-07-07T06:59:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	I guess there's more I need to do?
2007-07-07T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	Have you updated your package list since enabling it?
2007-07-07T07:00:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	It was updated when I installed, but I don't think I have, no.
2007-07-07T07:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	What happens when you run: sudo apt-get install libpam-keyring
2007-07-07T07:01:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	I'd imagine it would work, let's see
2007-07-07T07:01:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	password prompt and installed :)
2007-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	Is it strange that it didn't show up in synaptic, though?
2007-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	Yes, very, there is no reason it shouldn't have
2007-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	hmm
2007-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	possibly why I couldn't find clearlooks, either
2007-07-07T07:03:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	the only thing that isn't checked in the 'Downloadable from the Internet' section is source code
2007-07-07T07:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	That shouldn't matter
2007-07-07T07:04:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	yeah, weird... This is on a stock installation, perhaps something changed in Feisty?
2007-07-07T07:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	slocate	Nope, apt aptitude and synaptic all use the same list of packages
2007-07-07T07:06:00.000Z	slocate	Jordan_U	weird, I'll have to come back and figure this out later though, thanks for the help!
