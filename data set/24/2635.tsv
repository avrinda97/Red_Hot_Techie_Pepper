2009-05-19T16:44:00.000Z	promet	neer	try unplugging your usb devices at boot (not your keyboard though) some bios confuse grub with extraneous usb at boot
2009-05-19T16:47:00.000Z	neer	promet	I was using 8.04 ubuntu, then I upgraded to 9.04..from then my laptop is not booting
2009-05-19T16:48:00.000Z	promet	neer	what exactly happen wen you turn it on?
2009-05-19T16:49:00.000Z	neer	promet	 let me check
2009-05-19T16:52:00.000Z	neer	promet	it says " gave up waiting for root device"
2009-05-19T16:53:00.000Z	neer	promet	"check roodelay"
2009-05-19T16:54:00.000Z	neer	promet	"Check rootdelay"
2009-05-19T16:54:00.000Z	neer	promet	are you there?
2009-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	promet	neer	"check roodelay" I can honestly say I've never seen that one before
2009-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	promet	neer	is that right after the machine boots?
2009-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	neer	promet	it tries to boot
2009-05-19T16:56:00.000Z	neer	promet	but actually I don't know it has booted or not
2009-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	neer	promet	this upgrade has ruined my pc
2009-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	promet	neer	I think "ruined" is a strong word, if you really think that, mail it to me...
2009-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	neer	promet	because I used to like 8.04 a lot
2009-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	neer	promet	 it was very good..then this upgrade came up and now I am using windows xp.....
2009-05-19T17:00:00.000Z	neer	promet	it also says " missing modules (cat /proc/modules)
