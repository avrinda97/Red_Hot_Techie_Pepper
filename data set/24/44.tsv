2012-10-01T06:35:00.000Z	XDev		When i tried that method all that happens is I go to windows only, and cant get back into ubuntu
2012-10-01T06:36:00.000Z	XDev		yes
2012-10-01T06:37:00.000Z	XDev		resursive
2012-10-01T06:38:00.000Z	XDev		The only thing i have a prob with is the settings upon installing ubuntu to partition that unallocated space
2012-10-01T06:38:00.000Z	XDev		And aftewards the bootloader part
2012-10-01T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	if you made the unallocated partition under Windows, you would need to do that manually
2012-10-01T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	how much space did you clear for Ubuntu?
2012-10-01T06:43:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	answer your PM before you get more bad advice.. i'll talk you through this.
2012-10-01T06:44:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	either answer my PM and i will help you, or i'll simply dub you a troll and ignore.
2012-10-01T06:45:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	i have tried to help you, you will not listen.
2012-10-01T07:01:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	you need to not follow that tutorial
2012-10-01T07:01:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	you can probably install through ubuntu.
2012-10-01T07:02:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	what you done wrong, was using windows to partition the space.
2012-10-01T07:03:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	well, at this point, you've already done it.... so the easiest thing, is to adapt and overcome... use the space you made under windows, but... for the 204,303,203rd time.. you have to do this manually
2012-10-01T07:05:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	no, .. i have tried to help you, you refuse to listen.... i live byy the "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink" motto
2012-10-01T07:07:00.000Z	XDev	KM0201	if by manual you mean the SOMETHING ELSE i believe option
2012-10-01T07:08:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	hmm, it might be somethin else.. i thought it said "manually partition" or something like that.. but i usually use the text installer, so i will take your word for that
2012-10-01T07:10:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	again, i have offered to PM you and talk you through this.... my wording on what exactly the installer says may be wrong.. but i assure you, i have encountered your "problem" with new people trying to install approximately 80 gazillion times, and i've successfully worked around it many times
2012-10-01T07:17:00.000Z	KM0201	XDev	will not work in your scenario
