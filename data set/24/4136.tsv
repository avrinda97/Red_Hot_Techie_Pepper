2007-07-02T12:40:00.000Z	sakaa		do anybody have any experience with succesfully installing their nvidia graphics cards?
2007-07-02T12:40:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	nvidia is usually pretty painless
2007-07-02T12:41:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	what card model?
2007-07-02T12:43:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	just preface the comment with my name. that way if i have to go someone else can pick it up.  you can type the first few letters and hit tab key to auto complete the name
2007-07-02T12:44:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	like this?
2007-07-02T12:44:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	yep
2007-07-02T12:44:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	great ok, so did u install ur graphics card succesfully?
2007-07-02T12:46:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	hallo?
2007-07-02T12:46:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	yeah. as long as its not a very new nvidia card you can do 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx; sudo nvidia-xconfig;' and hit alt-ctrl-backspace then you should see nvidia logo at login screen. old cards need nvidia-glx-legacy very new cards nvidia-glx-new
2007-07-02T12:47:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	if anything goes wrong do this alt-ctrl-f2 then login then type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose vesa for the driver. thats the generic one then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart thatll at least git gui back
2007-07-02T12:47:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	yea here's the thing i installed like the newest "binary" drivers for it directly from nvidia, but which worked as i went into the gui straight after wards i got the "desktop effects" working but now i cannot acces it all not even if i set the driver to be vesa
2007-07-02T12:49:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	the thing is that the 8800 gts is very new is not really supported generically by ubuntu even tho they say so.. so other people told me to do it this way but now i can't make it work at all
2007-07-02T12:50:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	seems like sound advise i normally use th nvidia installer myself. only problem is that if you do an auto update and the kernel is replaced you have to rerun it.  id /join #ubuntu-effects and as there also im afraid i dont have any exp with the beryl/compiz stuff
2007-07-02T12:51:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	ok thanks how do i do that? also would u know to remove the new driver and just go back to the vesa one?
2007-07-02T12:53:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	sudo NV*.run --uninstall  should remove the nvidia pacakge. i dont think that is your problem though. just replacing nvidia with vesa in xorg.conf is all you need to to do. if the login screen comes up then id assume its a problem with the wm
2007-07-02T12:54:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	aight thank u! it does not, how did i join that other chat room, i found this by google
2007-07-02T12:55:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	/join #ubuntu-effects
2007-07-02T12:56:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	ok , it does seem like there are anybody there tho?
2007-07-02T12:57:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	would u know any other resource that might have a solution?
2007-07-02T13:00:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	there is if it only shows you then the channel name is wrong
2007-07-02T13:00:00.000Z	sakaa	pike_	yes i think ive found it now, thank u very much for ur help
2007-07-02T13:01:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	typically what i do is a google search like 'site:ubuntuforums.org myproblem'
2007-07-02T13:01:00.000Z	pike_	sakaa	np
