2006-12-22T09:17:00.000Z	thomas		hey guys, i'm having a problem with my panel. when run, it crashes. however, when run as root, it doesn't crash. please help me solve this
2006-12-22T09:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	what does   ls -l ~/.Xauthority  say ? ( and why are you running gnome as root? )
2006-12-22T09:20:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	i'm not running gnome as root, i'm running the panel as root, as when run as user it crashes.

2006-12-22T09:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	OK that looks all right - what do you mean about running the panel as root then?
2006-12-22T09:22:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	on login, the panel just crashes. so i open the panel as root in a terminal so i can function.
2006-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	that sounds like asking for problems - which is why I asked about .Xauthority
2006-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	have you tried just running " killall gnome-panel " as your normal user ?
2006-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	yeah
2006-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	it should respawn
2006-12-22T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	do ou also own ~/.ICEauthority ? ls -l ~/.ICEauthority
2006-12-22T09:24:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	it respawns and crashes
2006-12-22T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic		hmm
2006-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	what does  ls -l ~/.ICEauthority  say ?

2006-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	OK
2006-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	running out of ideas here :)
2006-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	any error messages if you run gnome-panel from a terminal as your user?
2006-12-22T09:26:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	ughhh i don't know what to do. i'm thinking about just creating a new user and seeing if that helps. and no, there's no output, and the crash information yields nothing useful. its a segfault
2006-12-22T09:26:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	brb
2006-12-22T09:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	yes, test with a new user
2006-12-22T09:29:00.000Z	thomas	thoreauputic	UGH lame. thanks for the help, i seem to have figured out that its just my profile.
2006-12-22T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thomas	ah OK
