2010-03-15T07:23:00.000Z	haakon87		please ignore the silly account name, I was a lot younger then and thought it sounded cool. Note to younger users: Don't try to sound cool :p
2010-03-15T07:25:00.000Z	haakon87		didn't someone suggest just installing python docs?
2010-03-15T07:25:00.000Z	haakon87		Language is what?
2010-03-15T07:26:00.000Z	haakon87		Also, EzeQL, my system runs in Norwegian, Bokm√•l.
2010-03-15T07:26:00.000Z	haakon87		thanks :)
2010-03-15T07:26:00.000Z	EzeQL	haakon87	nice language xD
2010-03-15T07:26:00.000Z	haakon87		The language is one of those things that make linguists come over and study us.
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	haakon87		What language do you use EzeQL?
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	EzeQL	haakon87	: yes? why?
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	EzeQL		english.
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	haakon87		Why they want to study us?
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	EzeQL		yes
2010-03-15T07:27:00.000Z	haakon87		Basically, we have a bunch of really weird language quirks.
2010-03-15T07:28:00.000Z	haakon87		For instance, we have a system where the melody of the word change it's meaning.
2010-03-15T07:28:00.000Z	EzeQL		wow, haakon87 ... so pretty complex language
2010-03-15T07:28:00.000Z	haakon87		Lammet and lamme would be transcribed the same into IPA, but will mean either lamb or paralyze.
2010-03-15T07:29:00.000Z	haakon87		Which wouldn't be that weird, except that it's only found in Norwegian, Swedish and SE Asian languages.
2010-03-15T07:29:00.000Z	haakon87		Your desktop.
2010-03-15T07:29:00.000Z	haakon87		I think?
2010-03-15T07:29:00.000Z	EzeQL		would not be a problem to learn your language or Swedish for having a nordic girlfriend  :D:D
2010-03-15T07:30:00.000Z	haakon87	EzeQL	Is this the great Cold North stereotype coming into play again?
2010-03-15T07:30:00.000Z	EzeQL		hahahaha
2010-03-15T07:30:00.000Z	EzeQL	haakon87	yeah!
