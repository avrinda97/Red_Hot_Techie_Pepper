2008-03-11T10:22:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	chattr +i
2008-03-11T10:23:00.000Z	zl3cat		+a?
2008-03-11T10:23:00.000Z	zl3cat		Oh.. didn't know that
2008-03-11T10:24:00.000Z	neo_	zl3cat	   didnt got u?
2008-03-11T10:25:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	chattr can make the file 'immutable' or 'append-only' -- this overrides the normal ugo+-rwx permissions, very unlikely for any program to accidentally change it back
2008-03-11T10:29:00.000Z	neo_		agent_bob : how to use it with /etc/hosts
2008-03-11T10:31:00.000Z	neo_		agent_bob : it should be like that no program should be able to change ,,,   only i can
2008-03-11T10:32:00.000Z	neo_		agent_bob : it should be like that no program should be able to change /etc/hosts,,,   only i can
2008-03-11T10:33:00.000Z	neo_		sudo works         it output   ¨boo¨
2008-03-11T10:34:00.000Z	zl3cat		not sure why he would want to do that, but fixing his box after he breaks it should make a nice learning experience :)
2008-03-11T10:37:00.000Z	neo_		agent_bob : prblm is that when some program changes the first line of file program starts very slow

2008-03-11T10:37:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	just for the record, no program will change /etc/hosts unless there is a very good reason.. and if there is a very good reason and it can't be changed, it might cause important programs to fail when /etc/hosts is 'wrong' (not changed as it was supposed to be)
2008-03-11T10:38:00.000Z	neo_		i think mozzila fire fox do it
2008-03-11T10:39:00.000Z	zl3cat		firefox should be running as a normal user (you) and should not have access to write /etc/hosts at any time
2008-03-11T10:39:00.000Z	neo_		zl3cat:i think mozzila fire fox do it
2008-03-11T10:39:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	I think you are wrong. It should not be possible for firefox to change the contents of /etc/hosts. Ever.
2008-03-11T10:40:00.000Z	neo_		so what is the reason p  startlong torograms taking to
2008-03-11T10:40:00.000Z	neo_		so what is the reason pr ograms taking to long to start
2008-03-11T10:41:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	perhaps in the past you have done some other action which is equally inadvisable and are now suffering the consequences of that?
2008-03-11T10:41:00.000Z	neo_		when i edit the file it seems fine
2008-03-11T10:41:00.000Z	zl3cat	neo_	well, your box.. don't say we didn't warn you..
