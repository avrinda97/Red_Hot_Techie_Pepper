2004-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	pestilence		could somebody explain how i get the oss compatibility drivers to load automatically in ubuntu?
2004-09-29T08:22:00.000Z	pestilence		i've tried putting lines in /etc/modutils/alsa-base but it does nothing
2004-09-29T08:22:00.000Z	Deft_u	pestilence	thry probably are, does you volume control not show two sets of mixers?
2004-09-29T08:22:00.000Z	pestilence	Deft_u	there's no /dev/dsp, which is the problem
2004-09-29T08:23:00.000Z	pestilence	Deft_u	snd-pcm-oss
2004-09-29T08:23:00.000Z	pestilence		is not loaded
2004-09-29T08:23:00.000Z	Deft_u	pestilence	does modprobe snd_pcm_oss produce errors?
2004-09-29T08:23:00.000Z	pestilence	Deft_u	no
2004-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	pestilence		and everything works fine after i do that....i just need to get that module loaded automatically
2004-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	Deft_u		ok, quick fix is to add it /etc/modules then, just add that name on a line of the file by itself
2004-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	pestilence		there is a line in /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian that tells me a about it
2004-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	pestilence		but i did what it says, and that didn't help
2004-09-29T08:26:00.000Z	pestilence		i did that
2004-09-29T08:26:00.000Z	pestilence		i put it in /etc/modutils/alsa-base
2004-09-29T08:26:00.000Z	pestilence		and ran update-modules
2004-09-29T08:27:00.000Z	pestilence		in /etc/hotplug/blacklist?
2004-09-29T08:27:00.000Z	Deft_u		someone will try
2004-09-29T08:30:00.000Z	pestilence		so, does ubuntu use /etc/modprobe at all?  from the documentation it sounds like there was a switch from /etc/modules.conf to it in the 2.6 version of module-init-tools, but the file is empty
2004-09-29T08:33:00.000Z	pestilence		/etc/init.d/gdm restart
2004-09-29T08:33:00.000Z	pestilence		or stop :)
2004-09-29T08:35:00.000Z	Deft_u		froma console, sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2004-09-29T08:36:00.000Z	pestilence		what is the advantage of using invoke-rc.d over just typing in the path to the script?
2004-09-29T08:36:00.000Z	Deft_u	pestilence	I have no idea, but debian told me to...
2004-09-29T08:37:00.000Z	pestilence	Deft_u	it has roughly the same number of keystrokes, so i guess it must be personal preference :)
