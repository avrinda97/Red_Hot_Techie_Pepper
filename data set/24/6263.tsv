2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		why isnt there a single linux file system with transparent compression?!
2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	Samuli^	nolimitsoya	?
2006-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Samuli^	have i missed something? :P
2006-10-15T06:09:00.000Z	Samuli^		transparent compression?
2006-10-15T06:09:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Samuli^	compressing files on write, transparent to programs and users
2006-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		like, fe ntfs or zfs
2006-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	Samuli^		 nolimitsoya, I think it's because it's stupid :)
2006-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		saves diskspace, saves i/o, boosts performance. thats not stupid :)
2006-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		thats good :)
2006-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	Samuli^		boosts performance, hardly.
2006-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	Samuli^		see everything has to be compressed and uncompressed, if not on your harddrive then on the system memory.
2006-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Samuli^	do the benchmarks yourself. ;) in diskintensive usage, it does wonders
2006-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		usualy you have loads of cpu cycels doing nothing
2006-10-15T06:11:00.000Z	Samuli^	nolimitsoya	at what cost to the cpu?
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Samuli^		and memory.
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		very low, with simple compressiontechniques
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		memory is no issue either
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		a few extra mp
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Samuli^		but to answer your question, I don't think there is such thing.
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		*m
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		mb
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Samuli^		MB you meen.
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Samuli^		mean.
2006-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Samuli^	i know there isnt, i just wonder why :)
