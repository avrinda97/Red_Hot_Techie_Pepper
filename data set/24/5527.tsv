2006-08-28T07:52:00.000Z	Kragnerac		Hello, I am considering on transitioning my kernel from i386 to i686 due to numerous claims that it improves performance. But first of all, I just wanted to know will it break anything? Do I have anything to lose by transitioning to i686?
2006-08-28T07:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	I have both 386 and 686 kernels in my grub menu, 686 is a bit faster but has some odd things like.. will not power off, just gets to a will shut down prompt
2006-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	How did you mount it?
2006-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	"sudo mount /dev/hda1"
2006-09-21T10:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Can you post your fstab to the pastebin and not into the channel

2006-09-21T10:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Your windows is on a fat and not ntfs?
2006-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Is it a ntfs that was converted to fat?
2006-09-21T10:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Does your windows boot ok?
2006-09-21T11:55:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, I tried booting into Windows. Works fine. Here's a screenshot of what the drive icon looks like. http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/1354/screenshotgn7.png
2006-09-21T12:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Sorry guys had to answer the door....
2006-09-21T12:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	What does windows show as the name of the windows partition.. ANy funny characters there?

2006-09-21T12:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	I saw that but what is the name as windows sees it.. and can you read it in linux ok or not?
2006-09-21T12:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	I must ask... Have you run scripts like Automatix, (NOT recommending that you do.) to install anything?
2006-09-21T12:08:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	Yes, I can see the files in Linux. Is Windows supposed to show another name than the drive letter for it's partition (other than C:\ in my case)?
2006-09-21T12:09:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	Nope. I just installed Ubuntu a few minutes ago.
2006-09-21T12:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	Windows explorer usually shows a name as well
2006-09-21T12:09:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	It says "Local Disk".
2006-09-21T12:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	An odd character in the Windows name might account for the funny name you see.
2006-09-21T12:10:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	Hmm. Hold on a second.
2006-09-21T12:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	NExt time you are in windows use windows explorer, right click the C drive and left click properties and see what the name is..
2006-09-21T12:14:00.000Z	Kragnerac	Jack_Sparrow	I checked the properties menu. No strange characters there.
2006-09-21T12:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Kragnerac	I dont have an answer for the odd name, but at least you can get to your files.
