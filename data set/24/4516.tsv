2007-08-26T12:19:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	is wpa_supplicant a package?
2007-08-26T12:09:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	afaik wireless stack has been around for some time
2007-08-26T12:10:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	some drivers use it some don't
2007-08-26T12:10:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	what is afaik wireless stack?
2007-08-26T12:10:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	afaik = as far as i know
2007-08-26T12:11:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	what card or you trying to get to work?
2007-08-26T12:12:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	i haven't used one of those before. have you tried ndiswrapper?
2007-08-26T12:15:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	i tried a guide on ubuntuforums.org removing network manager and using ndiswrapper but i don't want to remove network manager
2007-08-26T12:17:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	i've never used network manager... personally i just setup a bunch of preferred networks in wpa_supplicant and just forget about it. it's up to you but editing the odd text file is really not much worse than network manager
2007-08-26T12:18:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	then what is the line to add for my wpa passowrd?
2007-08-26T12:18:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	in wpa_supplicant?
2007-08-26T12:19:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	yes you can get it through apt-get, et al
2007-08-26T12:20:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	but you still need drivers that work
2007-08-26T12:20:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	wpa_supplicant only controls what your card connects to and the crypto
2007-08-26T12:20:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	ndiswrapper drivers or binary linux drivers?
2007-08-26T12:22:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	probably the windoze drivers through ndiswrapper are best
2007-08-26T12:23:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	if the linux drivers are binary only then they probably won't play nicely with wpa_supplicant (they would need to support the wireless stack you were mentioning earlier)
2007-08-26T12:24:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	that won't help
2007-08-26T12:25:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	have you found a howto using ndiswrapper?
2007-08-26T12:26:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	i will check... there is a package for using ndiswrapper gui shall i use it.?
2007-08-26T12:26:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	you could but i've never used it
2007-08-26T12:36:00.000Z	FordCortina	arman	what didn't work with your wireless card?
2007-08-26T12:47:00.000Z	arman	FordCortina	i will install driver with this guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=493958&highlight=rtl8187 but i want to add my wpa password and static ip -- can you help please
