2005-12-11T06:04:00.000Z	cary		i have a quick question for anyone: i am soon likely to own a PC (as opposd to my macs) that will basically be for tinkering. ill want to boot unbuntu, win2000/xp?, and possibly mac osX86. how hard is it to make a machine dual/triple boot between these things? anyone know or have a link to a place that is fairly detailed?
2005-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	it's easy with Ubuntu. Install Windows first, then Ubuntu.
2005-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	The Ubuntu installer will detect Windows and configure grub to dual-boot. No idea about OSX.
2005-12-11T06:07:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	 kbuntu breezy, WinXP.
2005-12-11T06:10:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	yes, Kubuntu is KDE on Ubuntu. With gnome-support, though. :-)
2005-12-11T06:10:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Gnome is C based, KDE is C++
2005-12-11T06:11:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	 KDE is more easily used by someone from Windows.  GNOME is more limited in configuration.
2005-12-11T06:11:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Try both and see which one you like.
2005-12-11T06:12:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	install Ubuntu, which will give you GNOME by default. Then use Synaptic to install the kde-desktop package.
2005-12-11T06:12:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Then you'll have both GNOME and KDE installed.  At the login screen, you can choose which one to run.
2005-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	before installing the kde-desktop package, edit the file "/etc/apt/source.list" and put this line in "deb http://kubuntu.org/packages/kde35 breezy main". Then you'll get the latest & greated KDE.
2005-12-11T06:15:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	You don't absolutely need to use the command line. But that's where the power is. :-)
2005-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	 And if you really want to understand Linux (rather than the GUI), you'll do it from the command line.
2005-12-11T06:17:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	For what purposes do you use a computer?
2005-12-11T06:17:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	 You'll use the GIMP then. :-)
2005-12-11T06:18:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Which is available in Windows.
2005-12-11T06:21:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Ubuntu will make it easy for you to use Linux.  But you'll only understand Linux by working at the command line.
2005-12-11T06:23:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	then runlevel 1 is your friend. :-)
2005-12-11T06:24:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	It will be for a while.
2005-12-11T06:25:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	runlevels are the system configurations that Linux can load on booting. In Debian-based distributions (which Ubuntu is), runlevel 1 is the maintenance configuration (i.e. no GUI) and runlevel 2 is the normal operating configuration (i.e. the full GUI environment).
2005-12-11T06:25:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	Have fun. :-)
2005-12-11T06:27:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	actually, why don't you take out a free subscription to TUX magazine?
2005-12-11T06:27:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	It's distributed as a PDF file via email.
2005-12-11T06:27:00.000Z	DarthFrog	cary	You'll find it very useful.
