2010-04-04T02:01:00.000Z	jzacsh	bidhu	I say this, because I just relized you said something to me -- because it wasn't hilihgted

2010-04-04T02:02:00.000Z	jzacsh	bidhu	so, ubuntu is on your laptop -- now what's the "mobile" you mentioned ealier (and the samsung device you mentioned)?
2010-04-04T02:05:00.000Z	jzacsh	bidhu	yes, you have a samsung b3410 -- what is that?
2010-04-04T02:07:00.000Z	jzacsh	bidhu	I'm having a tough time understanding you. what is a "mobile". in the US that can mean a mobile phone, or a netbook
