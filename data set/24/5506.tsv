2006-06-21T13:11:00.000Z	fedex		hi!
2006-06-21T13:12:00.000Z	fedex		i have a, uhm, "little" problem...upgraded to dapper the change-repos-name way...and is officialy unbootable..my fault!
2006-06-21T13:13:00.000Z	fedex		now i am using a live gnu/linx, and want to update, dloaded both desktop and alt dapper
2006-06-21T13:13:00.000Z	fedex		i need NOT to delete some folders in my /home, is that possible?? install and not erase from within?
2006-06-21T13:14:00.000Z	fedex		or no way?
2006-06-21T13:15:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 i assume /home isn't a separate partition?
2006-06-21T13:16:00.000Z	fedex		thanks wastrel, no, not it is
2006-06-21T13:16:00.000Z	fedex		oh polpak i now! now....but previously I erased, this time  am goinf to install in a dif partition.
2006-06-21T13:17:00.000Z	fedex		going, sorry.
2006-06-21T13:17:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	tar up /home and put it somewhere
2006-06-21T13:18:00.000Z	fedex		wastrel its 20 gigs of stuff i do need, and backing it up via CD would take forever....where is that "safe" somewhere?.
2006-06-21T13:19:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 hmm :]   scp it to another system via ethernet ?
2006-06-21T13:19:00.000Z	fedex		wastrel so there is no other trick? I mean...nor even the alternative .iso I burned has some feature to do this?
2006-06-21T13:20:00.000Z	fedex		its mostly mp3, so taring wont reduce that much
2006-06-21T13:20:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 you could try to shrink your partition with gparted and then install into the new unpartitioned space
2006-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 there's no easy method :] 
2006-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	fedex		wastrel i know, going the difficult one!!!!
2006-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	fedex		wastrel gparted would help?? i am going to try that.... but you mean I install over the unpartitioned space and it wont erase the whole disk?
2006-06-21T13:23:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 you can tell the installer to ignore existing partitions , if there is free space or a free partition to install in
2006-06-21T13:24:00.000Z	fedex	wastrel	which installer, desktop or alternative dapper? and which "method"...sorry to bother
2006-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 either one i think - just make sure you're careful during the partitioning part of the installer - keepin mind i've only installed dapper once :] 
2006-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	fedex	wastrel	after i did the upgrade, I fucked the X on breezy...
2006-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	fedex		/register
2006-06-21T13:27:00.000Z	wastrel	fedex	 good luck, i have to go
