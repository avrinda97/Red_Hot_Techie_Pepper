2012-07-23T23:43:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	ty
2012-07-23T23:45:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	i found my model and i select Linux and it shows me this download list: vendor list bios
2012-07-23T23:45:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	bios-utilites, others, manuals
2012-07-23T23:46:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	what should i download ?
2012-07-23T23:46:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	I don't think that they are supporting linux :/ I can't download linux drivers for my board too
2012-07-23T23:47:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	so how can i connet to the internet with ubuntu???
2012-07-23T23:47:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	are you in need of ethernet drivers?
2012-07-23T23:47:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	yes  but for ubuntu
2012-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	Oh but Asus don't have them, those drivers are community made but I'll try to find driver for you that you can install
2012-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	i cant connect to the internet cause it tells me wired network - disconnected
2012-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	hope u can find one
2012-07-23T23:49:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	what is your ethernet card? realtek, atheros etc
2012-07-23T23:49:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	how can i know that?
2012-07-23T23:49:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	nvidia i think
2012-07-23T23:50:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	on the pc with ubuntu write lspci and look for ethernet controller and post what ethernet controller you are using
2012-07-23T23:50:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	ok
2012-07-23T23:51:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	NVIDIA Corporation MCP65 Ethernet
2012-07-23T23:56:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	 nothing?
2012-07-23T23:57:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	can't seem to find anything :/ the ethernet should work though I don't understand why
2012-07-23T23:59:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	with windows 7 all drivers are installed automatically
2012-07-23T23:59:00.000Z	boghiu	Reindeernix	but with ubundu i think not
2012-07-24T00:01:00.000Z	Reindeernix	boghiu	for me it's the reverse, I have to install ethernet driver on windows 7
