2009-07-10T22:30:00.000Z	robertr994		I have a question about processor usage.  I just switched from windows 2003  where my processors ran about 5% peak but my memory usage was 1.5 gig normally.  here is a screenshot of my Ubuntu 8.04 currently online http://www.kwtfstudio.com/1/Screenshot-System%20Monitor.png  the website is www.kwtfstudio.com    any way to get the processor usage down ?
2009-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	robertr994		only running a LAMP
2009-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	if nobody can answer here then try #ubuntu-server and #linux..
2009-07-10T22:32:00.000Z	robertr994		ok, let me do a screenshot of processes
2009-07-10T22:33:00.000Z	robertr994		well,  I never ran linux till 3 days ago
2009-07-10T22:33:00.000Z	robertr994		I got lost with the server edition
2009-07-10T22:35:00.000Z	robertr994		ok cool,   is it normal to swap from one processor to the other back and forth?  looks like it is,  wish windows did that
2009-07-10T22:37:00.000Z	robertr994		ok,  well this is my first shot with Linux,  Ubuntu is the answer
2009-07-10T22:38:00.000Z	robertr994		tj83 -  ok,  Im still a noob lol
2009-07-10T22:40:00.000Z	robertr994		my only 2 issues right now on my AMD64  is drivers for Nivdia 9800gt not working right and flash for firefox
2009-07-10T22:43:00.000Z	robertr994		Netsurf, I was wondering about 32 bit firefox.  its not really a huge deal because I dont use this box for anything but a server
2009-07-10T22:43:00.000Z	robertr994		but the video issue kills me,  screen resolution is horrible
2009-07-10T22:44:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	did you install the nvidia driver supplied by ubuntu? from the hardware driver menu?
2009-07-10T22:45:00.000Z	robertr994		scuinzi, nividia 9800gt on a amd64  isnt supported.  its a install at your own risk deal
2009-07-10T22:45:00.000Z	robertr994		in Linux
2009-07-10T22:46:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	you can use the 64 bit driver supplied by nvidia..
2009-07-10T22:47:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_amd64_185.18.14.html  .. there is a trick to installing it though.
2009-07-10T22:48:00.000Z	robertr994	scunizi	how would I install that, I actually have that on my desktop
2009-07-10T22:49:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	the first thing is to deactivate the current running nvidia driver from hardware drivers.. then open synaptic and uninstall the nvidia bits listed that are installed..
2009-07-10T22:49:00.000Z	robertr994		ok
2009-07-10T22:50:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	after all that http://pastebin.com/f44f9d82b
2009-07-10T22:52:00.000Z	robertr994	scunizi	thanks I will try that tonight when everyone is sleeping  lol
2009-07-10T22:52:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	you'll have to remember that by installing the driver you'll have to go through the reinstall process for each kernel upgrade..
2009-07-10T22:53:00.000Z	scunizi	robertr994	also if  you use "Update" to go from one release to the next you'll want to uninstall it first.
