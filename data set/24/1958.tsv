2009-06-06T13:53:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	wh not have him use compiz --replace or emerald --replace?
2009-06-06T13:53:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	I assume he doesn't have any emerald themes... so I wasn't sure what that would do
2009-06-06T13:54:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	compiz runs like crap period >.>
2009-06-06T13:54:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	not in my experiences
2009-06-06T13:56:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	It makes flash and java glitch for me... as well as messing up my screensaver
2009-06-06T13:56:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	huh... flash never worked for me, java... well java is just slow regardless, and I dont use xscreensaver, i use gscreensaver :X
2009-06-06T13:58:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	I miss wobbly windows and the cube lol
2009-06-06T13:59:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	i have AWN, Compiz-fuzion, and Emerald running on a 1.7 ghz celeron SC CPU, an nvidia 6200 with 256 megs on board, and 512 megs SDRAM...
2009-06-06T14:01:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	It's not the hardware end for me >.>
2009-06-06T14:02:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	whats giving you problems? and why do you have 10 underscores after your name?
2009-06-06T14:03:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	1, 2, 3 and 4 underscores were taken... so I got frustrated
2009-06-06T14:03:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	heh, at least that's a sensable reason :P
2009-06-06T14:04:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	Compizfusion makes flash games flicker and if anything gets on top of any section of a java app the entire thing turns white.
2009-06-06T14:04:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	And if I open the default screensaver selector program thingy my comp freezes.
2009-06-06T14:05:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	what GPU do you have?
2009-06-06T14:06:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	ATI Radeon HD 4850 1 gig GDDR3 ram
2009-06-06T14:06:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	and im assuming you have the restricted drivers installed
2009-06-06T14:07:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	yuppers

2009-06-06T14:10:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	So what is glx?
2009-06-06T14:11:00.000Z	gartral	Alex__________	one moment
2009-06-08T10:25:00.000Z	Alex__________	gartral	If you still have the deb file on your comp you can navigate to it and use sudo dpkg -r filename.deb
