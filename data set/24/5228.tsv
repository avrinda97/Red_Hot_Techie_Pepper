2008-05-15T08:49:00.000Z	monestri_		is it possible to get help with hibernation/suspend problems with ubuntu on laptops?
2008-05-15T08:50:00.000Z	monestri_		sigh, too many people to get help here
2008-05-15T08:51:00.000Z	starcannon	monestri_	the ubuntuforums.org is often a good place to look as well
2008-05-15T08:51:00.000Z	monestri_		don't get me started on the forums
2008-05-15T08:51:00.000Z	monestri_		the search feature is terrible
2008-05-15T08:51:00.000Z	monestri_		easier to search for what your looking for in google and + ubuntu forums
2008-05-15T08:52:00.000Z	monestri_		I've been having hibernation/suspend problems since fiesty and have never found a working solution there
2008-05-15T08:52:00.000Z	monestri_		I came here out of a last resort of starts, but it seems to have been a bad idea
2008-05-15T08:52:00.000Z	monestri_		sorts*
2008-05-15T08:52:00.000Z	starcannon	monestri_	sorry didn't know it wasn't working out, I have had great results myself, google a term followed with ubuntu, say for instance: nvidia ubuntu that will often times bring up forum results, you can do advanced google searches and tell it to return only ubuntuforum.org results as well if you prefer a different search engine
2008-05-15T08:53:00.000Z	starcannon	monestri_	whats yoru question? I'll help if I can, it is busy here tonight for sure
2008-05-15T08:54:00.000Z	monestri_		Basically in previous versions I couldn't suspend without rewaking back to a a screen with a missing mouse.
2008-05-15T08:54:00.000Z	monestri_		In Hardy I can't idle 10 minutes without the system hanging/black screen
2008-05-15T08:54:00.000Z	monestri_		much like a screensaver that won't end >.<
2008-05-15T08:55:00.000Z	monestri_	EdijusXP	look in the forums about ndiswrapper
2008-05-15T08:55:00.000Z	starcannon	monestri_	oi sorry i'm no good on suspend resume, your problem sounds usb related though, and I have read things about that here and there but i'm useless..
2008-05-15T08:55:00.000Z	monestri_		usb related??
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		where do you get that?
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		that's funny
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		because my usb ports don't work either.
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		Devices work if they're connected from boot, but hotswapping doesn't work.
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		And there's no dmesg response to usb devices being plugged in (hotswapping)
2008-05-15T08:56:00.000Z	monestri_		so it's not an automount issue.
2008-05-15T08:57:00.000Z	starcannon	monestri_	i was assuming the mouse is a usb mouse, that or I got your post mixed with another, it is goingby fast and i'm on an asus eee, and your tone is less than pleasant, i'm going back to answer questions in the forums, this place is wack tonight
