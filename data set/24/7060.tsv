2005-06-17T11:24:00.000Z	phillipc		I set up a dhcp server on my ubuntu machine. Clients connect to it and get a dhcp address. However, those clients can't connect the network, it's "unreachable." Why? Clients can't ping the dhcp server
2005-06-17T11:25:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	have you set the default gateway up in the dhcpd config?
2005-06-17T11:26:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	same subnet on all machines?
2005-06-17T11:28:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	same subnet. How do I configure a default gateway?
2005-06-17T11:31:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	how do I set up a default gateway?
2005-06-17T11:31:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	  option routers 192.168.129.10;   in your dhcpd.conf
2005-06-17T11:32:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	on the dhcp server
2005-06-17T11:32:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	I added that option, doesn't seem to make a different
2005-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	still network unreachable on the clients
2005-06-17T11:33:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	the clients can't even ping the dhcp server..?
2005-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	can't ping the dhcp server. It gets an ip from the server and then can't ping it =)
2005-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	ping fails immediately with connect: Network is unreachable
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	ifconfig on the client machines shows they have an IP?
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	yep
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	when I ifup the interface, I get "SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable"
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	lights on hub/switch?
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	both good
2005-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	have you got the mii-tool ?
2005-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	I don't think so
2005-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	it could be the full/duplex issue, get the mii-tool package
2005-06-17T11:41:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	actually I tried `route` on a client, and the destination is "192.168.0.0" and the gateway is "*". Does that sound right?
2005-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	the machine running dhcp giving out addresses is 192.168.0.52
2005-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	popey	phillipc	what IP does each machine have?
2005-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	phillipc	popey	the client I'm testing has 192.168.0.2
