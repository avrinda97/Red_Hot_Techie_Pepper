2007-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	Kalamansi		im not sure about "wine" thing
2007-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	it dosen't work in wine
2007-11-02T05:50:00.000Z	Kalamansi	cleaton	is there a way that dreamweavercs3 and photoshop cs3 could run in ubuntu?
2007-11-02T05:51:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	yes there is, you could install windows inside ubuntu and run it from there
2007-11-02T05:52:00.000Z	Kalamansi	cleaton	and still i will buy windows licenses??
2007-11-02T05:52:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	yes that's :(
2007-11-02T05:53:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	i know photoshop cs 2 works under wine
2007-11-02T05:53:00.000Z	Kalamansi	cleaton	install wine in windows xp?
2007-11-02T05:53:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	for more information on what you can run using wine, check this page http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=2631
2007-11-02T05:54:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	no you don't have to install xp if you use wine, wine is something that can help you run windows stuff on linux without having to install windows itself
2007-11-02T05:55:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	gimp is available for windows too if you want to check it out
2007-11-02T06:08:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	i think you're stuck if you have to use those, atleast for now :/
2007-11-02T06:13:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	if you don't pay the license it's illegal
2007-11-02T06:14:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	for webdevelopment i recomend aptana, or programming in general eclipse
2007-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	Kalamansi	cleaton	aptana and general eclipse is for ubuntu?
2007-11-02T06:17:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	yes
2007-11-02T06:18:00.000Z	cleaton	Kalamansi	check out http://www.eclipse.org/ and http://www.aptana.com/ . aptana has a free version and a pro version
