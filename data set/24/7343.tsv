2005-09-07T08:08:00.000Z	skreet		I do run an AMD64 as these 2 people do.
2005-09-07T08:08:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	amd64 with ati?
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Trying..
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	I think I'm failing -- but I am trying.
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	No chznce you can swap that card for an nvidia? (They compile/work fine)
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Oh yea, let me pull my X850XT PE real quick and buy a new video card..
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	 :)
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	Well, the think is...
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	I had an nvidia before.. i miss them :(
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	I checked compatibility BEFORE spending money ;-)
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Even the windows driviers SUCK
2005-09-07T08:10:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Heh ;)
2005-09-07T08:11:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	If I can find someone to give me what this card is worth I'd buy NV in a heartbeat. I cant even play KOTOR in windows..
2005-09-07T08:11:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	ouch
2005-09-07T08:11:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Yea, it's a known issue..
2005-09-07T08:11:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	ATI basically said "Yea, that dont work once you get to Dantoine" (sp?)
2005-09-07T08:12:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	scumbags <heh>
2005-09-07T08:12:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Yea, I'm not too happy -- card runs great,  not to mention alot cooler than nvidia did.. but overall I think I'd rather have an nv card.
2005-09-07T08:16:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	You must be thinking of the G5
2005-09-07T08:17:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	"With the unique all-in-one liquid cooling heatsink the G5 processor runs at a cool 88 degrees celcius" -- that was in a magazine somewhere..
2005-09-07T08:18:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	<heh> That seems a bit over the top.
2005-09-07T08:18:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	I thought so.
2005-09-07T08:19:00.000Z	cafuego	skreet	The MX440 is not happy with the latest nvidia driver, afaik.
2005-09-07T08:19:00.000Z	skreet	cafuego	Nevermind then.
