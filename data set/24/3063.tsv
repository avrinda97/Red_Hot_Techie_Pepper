2008-12-07T04:54:00.000Z	nemo		Say, if I want to do hibernation, does that mean I need 2 swap partitions, one for normal use, and one, the size of my memory, for swsup?
2008-12-07T04:54:00.000Z	nemo		or is all this automatic nowdays? (I'm installing ubuntu on my first notebook)
2008-12-07T04:55:00.000Z	nemo		you'd think the swap, if in use, would not do well on resuming if it was overwritten with memory
2008-12-07T04:56:00.000Z	nemo		would hibernation simply fail?
2008-12-07T04:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	just make one, 2xram
2008-12-07T04:57:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	hrm. that seems again like a bad idea.  what happens if the swap gets used to 1x + y point?
2008-12-07T04:58:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	I'm basically seeking reassurence it is reliable, otherwise if it isn't, how to tell swap to use a partition reserved just for it
2008-12-07T04:58:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	so far you guys haven't been very reassurring ;)
2008-12-07T04:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	if your swap usage is > ram size, using the system will be a problem, not hibernating :)
2008-12-07T04:58:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	no no
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	my point is lets say I'm using, oh, openoffice, firefox, gimp, inkscape, maybe running tomcat and eclipse...
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	I'm sucking up memory, and I am using not only 2GiB of memory but also, oh, 2.1GiB of swap
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	and I try to hibernate
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	seems there simply won't be enough swap.  what happens then?
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	this is in a scenario of 4GiB of swap, 2GiB of memory
2008-12-07T04:59:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	hibernating a system with such an high memory usage is insane :)
2008-12-07T05:00:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	um. my point is I'd like a system that should work reliably :-p
2008-12-07T05:00:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	your response implies to me my intuition is correct. there'd be trouble
2008-12-07T05:00:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	hibernation is not reliably on linux, at least in general
2008-12-07T05:01:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	ugh. fine. 1x of swap and just being careful :-/
2008-12-07T05:01:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	I'd just as soon give swsup its own partition, but if that's not normal/possible, will just not worry about it :-/
2008-12-07T05:02:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	is is possible, not normal
2010-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	nemo	joaopinto	So, now that http://www.wolfire.com/humble has been FOSS'd, does that mean you guys will be adding 'em to the ubuntu gaming repo?
2010-05-12T01:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	nemo	probably yes
