2011-06-12T20:19:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	I ran the commands you suggested. Should I now try and reinstall unity?
2011-06-12T20:19:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	just logout and then login
2011-06-12T20:30:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	unity now claims that i do not have the hardware to run it :( it's put me onto Ubuntu Classic
2011-06-12T20:31:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	do you know what kind of graphics card you have? if not run lspci in a terminal and it should say
2011-06-12T20:32:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	"VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series" - it worked fine before today
2011-06-12T20:38:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	glxinfo only outputs "name of display: :0.0"
2011-06-12T20:42:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	so you don't have glx. for ati you have two options. one is the amd driver the other is something called radeonhd. the amd driver has better performance and the radeonhd is open source if you want to open up the hardware drivers you might be able to install one of them
2011-06-12T20:47:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	are both the amd and radeonhd drivers available in the software-center?
2011-06-12T20:48:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	yes you should be able to find the amd in additional drivers. the radeonhd is in software center/synaptic
2011-06-12T20:49:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	apparently ATI Radeon X.Org Driver is already installed
2011-06-12T20:50:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	thats probably radeonhd. its possible you have two things installed and they are conflicting. cant you !paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-06-12T20:54:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/625252/
2011-06-12T20:59:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	that shows you using fglrx which are the amd drivers. i don't know why you wouldn't have glx. I would go into additional drivers and try to reinstall/reenable the amd drivers
2011-06-12T21:01:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	i'd be grateful for step-by-step instructions on how to re-install them - having difficulty finding out
2011-06-12T21:03:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	try sudo apt-get remove fglrx; sudo apt-get install fglrx
2011-06-12T21:06:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	thank you! now I logout and try again?
2011-06-12T21:08:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	yeah. hopefully it works
2011-06-12T21:11:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	it's defaulting to classic mode despite selecting ubuntu :/
2011-06-12T21:13:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	im not sure why your glx isn't working. it seems like X is using fglrx, perhaps check what ls -l /usr/lib/libGL* says
2011-06-12T21:15:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/625269/
2011-06-12T21:16:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	I'm afraid I just don't know what to look for. I think the problem may be that your libgl is the mesa libgl but your driver is the amd fglrx, but I don't know how to fix it
2011-06-12T21:18:00.000Z	JamesGS	escott	don't worry about it :) I appreciate you trying to help! definitely the last time i muck about with compiz though, lol
2011-06-12T21:25:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	I think on logout it may not have been restarting X
2011-06-12T21:25:00.000Z	escott	JamesGS	so it didnt catch the new driver
