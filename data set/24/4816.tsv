2007-01-04T06:17:00.000Z	hemantsolanki	coz_	all i know is that it's having soundmax chip
2007-01-04T06:18:00.000Z	coz_	hemantsolanki	there si a slight chance that is possible however you need to research your onborad sound at this site   http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/    you will see "Choose manufacturer for more details" choose the manufaturere you mentioned and look through there
2007-01-04T06:20:00.000Z	coz_	hemantsolanki	red that site caregully,, if it says that it is supported then you may want to google that by typing Ubuntu at the beginning of the search string and the name of the sound card you found and see if there are solutions for that already on the forums, there probably are if it is supported
