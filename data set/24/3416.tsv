2009-11-14T05:36:00.000Z	airtonix		gnome-do is great. rww is refrering to the docky aspect of it
2009-11-14T05:37:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	oh, good. That'll alleviate some confusion :)
2009-11-14T05:37:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	jolaren my only gripe with docky is that it requires a compositing desktop for it to work nicely, (it works but the compositing makes it work much nicer)
2009-11-14T05:38:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	indeed. docky thankfully works with metacity compositing, though, so one doesn't need the compiz overhead
2010-02-07T11:13:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	Rayston: Newer versions of Ubuntu still respect an xorg.conf file if it's present, they just don't create one by default.
2010-03-27T09:21:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	or you can use the wl closed-source drivers (plug into ethernet, install bcmwl-kernel-source and b43-fwcutter)
2010-03-27T09:21:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	which actually work, unlike b43 in my experience :\
2010-03-27T09:22:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	sorry thats what i meant by b43, but it does not let me use my bluetooth
2010-03-27T09:22:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	ah, okay
2010-03-27T09:23:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	with bluepad its a handy thing to have if you want to skip traks on rhythm box while the netbook is folded up in the bag ><
2010-03-27T09:24:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	i just notice you mentioned "bcmwl-kernel-source" i dont remember doing this part. how would i confirm that its in use ?
2010-03-27T09:25:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	"lsmod | grep ^wl", see if you get any output
2010-03-27T09:25:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	ok nothing. just to be sure what is the wifi chipset you have ?
2010-03-27T09:25:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	BCM4312
2010-03-27T09:26:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	like this one ? 03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g (rev 01)
2010-03-27T09:26:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	yes
2010-03-27T09:27:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	are you able to use monitor mode then ?
2010-03-27T09:27:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	I don't know what that is :S
2010-03-27T09:27:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	another word for promiscuous mode.
2010-03-27T09:28:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	oh. That doesn't work with wl, needs b43 (which as I said doesn't work for me) or ndiswrapper (which I refuse to try because ndiswrapper breaks constantly for me)
2010-03-27T09:28:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	ok ndiswrapper wont let me use promiscous mode either thanks for the clarification though
2010-10-16T11:35:00.000Z	airtonix	rww	ssh let the hilarity continue
2010-11-24T13:06:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	try #ubuntu-stack.
2011-08-01T09:25:00.000Z	rww	airtonix	ask #freenode
