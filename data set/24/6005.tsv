2006-11-05T11:25:00.000Z	Curtman		How do I stop ubuntu from changing my hostname when I get a dhcp lease from my cable modem on eth0 ?
2006-11-05T11:26:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	your hostname or your dns?
2006-11-05T11:26:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Just my hostname would be a good start..  It changes it to s8907987398327493874 or whatever shaw gives me.
2006-11-05T11:28:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	modify /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script
2006-11-05T11:30:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	try what I told you to do.
2006-11-05T11:30:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Okay.
2006-11-05T11:31:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	I don't have a /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script.
2006-11-05T11:32:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	what release are you running?
2006-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Just /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and dhclient{enter,exit}-hooks.d/.  I don't know what version.
2006-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	of ubuntu
2006-11-05T11:33:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	6.10
2006-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	try running "dhclient -i $devicename" once on the client machine once.
2006-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	try running dhclient, it should create it for you.
2006-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	my dhclient has no '-i' arg..  It says "Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.0.4"
2006-11-05T11:36:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	sorry, without the -i
2006-11-05T11:39:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Well I pulled a new lease with dhclient and it didn't create that file..
2006-11-05T11:39:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	strange.
2006-11-05T11:40:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	$ locate dhclient-script?
2006-11-05T11:40:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Hmmm.. I have /sbin/dhclient-script and /lib/dhcp3-client/call-dhclient-script
2006-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	do what I told you on the /sbin one.
2006-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	or better yet.
2006-11-05T11:41:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	copy it to the folder in /etc/ and change it from there.
2006-11-05T11:42:00.000Z	Curtman	predius_	Shouldn't there be something I can add to /etc/networks/interfaces to tell it not to update?  This seems like it might be the hard way.  ;)
2006-11-05T11:44:00.000Z	predius_	Curtman	dhcp client is the one which gets your dhcp.
