2007-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	lockd	xivanari	can you mount the drive?
2007-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	lockd	xivanari	oh, if it's wiped then you may have trouble getting any of it back
2007-11-15T10:46:00.000Z	lockd	xivanari	what i'm saying, is did you leave the special partition it uses? or is this an external drive you never wiped?
2007-11-15T10:48:00.000Z	lockd	xivanari	or are the backup files hidden somewhere..
