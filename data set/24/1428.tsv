2010-01-22T03:41:00.000Z	stewartdenton		I am trying to run a script to install ispCP but get an error of "[: 10: =: unexpected operator
2010-01-22T03:41:00.000Z	stewartdenton		You have to be root, to execute this script!" in terminal. Not sure what to do from here as I chown the directory to have access
2010-01-22T03:41:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	sudo ./scriptname
2010-01-22T03:43:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	when I do that I get "sudo: unable to resolve host stewart-desktop
2010-01-22T03:44:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	what exactly is the purpose of specifying your computer name on the script execution? try using an IP? 127.0.0.1 for localhost?
2010-01-22T03:48:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	pardon my ignorance, I am just trying to install a CP on my desktop for trials. I am honestly lost on what to do. It appears that I need to be logged in as root in order for this script to work but am unsure how to do so.
2010-01-22T03:48:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	change to the folder where the script is, if it's on your desktop type "cd Desktop" in terminal, then type "sudo ./scriptname" where "scriptname" is the filename on the desktop, brb 2 mins
2010-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	I am in the folder of the script and try that, but what I get is : "root@stewart-desktop:~/ispcp_installer# sudo ./install
2010-01-22T03:51:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	ah sounds like an issue with sudo then, can you pastebin the contents of /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname ?
2010-01-22T03:52:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	I will try lol
2010-01-22T03:55:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	I dont appear to have a folder for either /etc/hosts or etc/hostname?
2010-01-22T04:01:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	9.10
2010-01-22T03:56:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	nah /etc/ is the only folder, "hosts" and "hostname" are config files. you can open them by hitting alt+f2 and typing "gedit /etc/hosts" etc
2010-01-22T03:59:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	http://paste.ubuntu.com/360323/
2010-01-22T04:00:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	which ubuntu is this?
2010-01-22T04:03:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	hrmm the content of those two files is totally wrong D: it's missing stuff i'd expect to see to make things work
2010-01-22T04:03:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	any ideas of a way to update/fix them?
2010-01-22T04:03:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	did you literally just install 9.10 (server is it?) a minute ago?
2010-01-22T04:05:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	hrmm so can you actually run sudo with anything? try er, "sudo nano /etc/hosts" and see if a text editor opens in the terminal window
2010-01-22T04:06:00.000Z	stewartdenton	daftykins	I have been using sudo quite a bit, but may have messed something up along the way :(
2010-01-22T04:06:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	ah ;x i know how to fix it but you'd have to do all sorts of tedious stuff with a livecd to sorta recover it, so i'd recommend just reinstalling to start with
2010-01-22T04:07:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	yeah something has edited the hosts and hostname file and broken sudo :S
2010-01-22T04:08:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	possibly that script! only a guess though ;)
2010-01-22T04:11:00.000Z	daftykins	stewartdenton	nah sorry, i just booted the server CD again and chose some kinda recovery that gave me a prompt, then i fixed /etc/hosts to say "127.0.0.1 localhost" "127.1.0.1 - computername" etc etc
