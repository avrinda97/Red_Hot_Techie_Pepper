2008-08-23T08:37:00.000Z	lars_		arrrghhh...how do I pastebin?
2008-08-23T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Go there, paste, hit the submit button, give us the URL
2008-08-23T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-08-23T08:44:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Whats the exact error?  anything about 127.0.0.1?
2008-08-23T08:45:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Your sources.list isn't the problem
2008-08-23T08:46:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	yes there is something about 127.0.01
2008-08-23T08:46:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Go ahead and paste the line with the 127.0.0.1 in it (here is fine, its just one line)
2008-08-23T08:47:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/Release.gpg  Could not connect to localhost:4001 (127.0.0.1). - connect (111 Connection refused)
2008-08-23T08:48:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	alright, you've somehow set up a proxy for apt.  Theres... a number of files it could be in (I'm a bit rusty with it), lets check /etc/apt/apt.conf
2008-08-23T08:50:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	what do I type where?
2008-08-23T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf is where we'll start
2008-08-23T08:51:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	that's normal.  Like I said, Its been a while since I've dealt with this error, you'll have to excuse my dead ends :)
2008-08-23T08:52:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	no problem
2008-08-23T08:53:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	echo $HTTP_PROXY  does that give you any output?
2008-08-23T08:53:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	http://localhost:4001
2008-08-23T08:54:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Alright, that's our issue.  Did yu try and set up a proxy on this machine?
2008-08-23T08:54:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	not to my recollection
2008-08-23T08:54:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	with anon-proxy or somethign like that?
2008-08-23T08:54:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	alright, do this: grep -r http_proxy /etc  and then grep -r http_proxy $HOME/.*
2008-08-23T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	well, if you set up anon-proxy, it's the one that did this.
2008-08-23T08:56:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	One of them ought to output something?
2008-08-23T08:59:00.000Z	lars_	Flannel	what were those last two commands?
2008-08-23T09:00:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	alright, do this: grep -r http_proxy /etc  and then grep -r http_proxy $HOME/.*
2008-08-23T09:02:00.000Z	Flannel	lars_	Alright, I should be, yeah.
