2007-01-28T08:37:00.000Z	latinoguy		i installed the ati software and i can see it in aplications/accesories
2007-01-28T08:37:00.000Z	latinoguy		but when i opened it says "Driver does not provide the Fire GL extensions X11
2007-01-28T08:38:00.000Z	latinoguy		does someone knows how to fix that
2007-01-28T08:38:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	 what card?
2007-01-28T08:39:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	 3d is better with opensource for that card... believe me, I installed one last week
2007-01-28T08:40:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	you change the driver to "radeon" in xorg.conf
2007-01-28T08:40:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	do you plan on using the tvout function?
2007-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	that wiki article was written using a 9250
2007-01-28T08:43:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	ok, sorry, then just  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change from "fglrx" in the driver section to "radeon"
2007-01-28T08:47:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	what does it say down under the Device section?  next to Driver
2007-01-28T08:50:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	looking... one moment
2007-01-28T08:51:00.000Z	latinoguy	CyberCo2	in driver says ati
2007-01-28T08:52:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	 on the pastebin page, line 95... says Driver    "ati"    change "ati" to "radeon"
2007-01-28T08:54:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	its useless
2007-01-28T08:57:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	go into terminal and type    glxgears -printfps
2007-01-28T09:02:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	any luck?
2007-01-28T09:02:00.000Z	latinoguy	CyberCo2	thanks im back
2007-01-28T09:03:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	if you saw gears moving you got 3d
2007-01-28T09:06:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	  no problem
2007-01-28T09:07:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	do not put beryl on that video card
2007-01-28T09:08:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	you will do nothing but earn yourself a headache... 3dsupport is active, but its still buggy and too slow for beryl
2007-01-28T09:09:00.000Z	latinoguy	CyberCo2	so your recomendation is not to do it
2007-01-28T09:09:00.000Z	CyberCo2	latinoguy	yes don't do it unless you upgrade to an nvidia
