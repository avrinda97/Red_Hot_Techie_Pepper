2004-12-19T15:26:00.000Z	calc		i didn't know previously that warty was frozen in june
2004-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	calc		oh btw is gnome 2.9 not supposed to display anything on the desktop?
2004-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	calc		2.8 in warty displayed things like home (iirc)
2004-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	seb128	calc	it's supposed to display the drives
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	calc	seb128	btw the applications.menu is going to be a fun thing to work out ;)
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	seb128	calc	no, warty doesn't display home
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	seb128	calc	and plug an usb key by example, it should pop on the desktop
2004-12-19T15:28:00.000Z	calc	seb128	hmm ok, i'll have to boot up a warty box and see what it displays again
2004-12-19T15:29:00.000Z	seb128	calc	there is no difference on the desktop between warty and hoary for the moment
2004-12-19T15:30:00.000Z	seb128	calc	you've probably changed some user setting for your user on warty
2004-12-19T15:30:00.000Z	calc	seb128	is there some configuration option i might need to set to get it to show the mounts on the desktop in 2.9?
2004-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	seb128	calc	 the options are in /apps/nautilus/desktop
2004-12-19T15:33:00.000Z	calc	seb128	i don't have that .gconf dir here
2004-12-19T15:33:00.000Z	seb128	calc	and your usb pop on the desktop, that works as expecte
2004-12-19T15:35:00.000Z	seb128	calc	I don't think so
2004-12-19T15:47:00.000Z	seb128	calc	you have the same options in /apps/nautilus/desktop ? and the same fstab ?
2004-12-24T15:16:00.000Z	seb128	calc	any backtrace of the crash ?
2004-12-24T15:17:00.000Z	calc	seb128	i'll try to grab one the next time it happens
2004-12-24T15:17:00.000Z	seb128	calc	I made -dbg packages for panel/applets/gnomevfs ... just install them :)
2005-01-04T15:32:00.000Z	calc	seb128	how about the evil window list bug?
2005-01-04T15:34:00.000Z	seb128	calc	what bug ?
2005-06-15T15:11:00.000Z	seb128	calc	around?
2005-07-03T07:19:00.000Z	seb128	calc	hi. Do you plan to update menu-xdg to fix the bug with duplicate menu items?
