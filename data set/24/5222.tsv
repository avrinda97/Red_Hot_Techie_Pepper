2006-10-20T07:21:00.000Z	Cas		Hello, yesterday a computer was shutdown hard because of a defect battery. Now the partition does mounts, if gives no errors with fsck, but the active user it's home directory has no rights/owner and give an Input/Output error on each command (chmod/chown/cd). Any ideas how to fix this?
2006-10-20T07:22:00.000Z	Cas		btw the partition type is ext3
2006-10-20T07:22:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	you may have to reformat your drive
2006-10-20T07:23:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	for now I would like to know if it's possible to get back the data
2006-10-20T07:23:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	- if you boot off of the ubuntu livecd you should be able to recover your data
2006-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	It's not my root dir so there is no need for that
2006-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	but what tools can I use to recover the partition?
2006-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	dd? cp?
2006-10-20T07:26:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	cp doesn't work since I can't enter the directory, and it seems to me that dd would copy the faults with it
2006-10-20T07:26:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	try booting off of the livecd first, then mounting the drive
2006-10-20T07:27:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	what would that do, does the livecd has more sanity checks before mounting? currently the partition is disabled in my fstab
2006-10-20T07:27:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	the livecd doesn't have a screwed up filesystem full of errors, your HD does
2006-10-20T07:28:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	^^
2006-10-20T07:28:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	fsck is the tool to check
2006-10-20T07:29:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	like I said, fsck doesn't give any errors
2006-10-20T07:29:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	- then you can back up your data and transfer it back over or deal with the errors
2006-10-20T07:31:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	like I said, I can't cd into my directory, ls -l gives me ? ? ? ? ? dirname, and chmod, chown and cd all gives me input/output error
2006-10-20T07:31:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	like I said, use the LIVECD
2006-10-20T07:31:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	I'm booting that already, but I've no idea how it could help
2006-10-20T07:32:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	that should allow you access to your /home directory.
2006-10-20T07:32:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	Ok, I will take a look, thanks for your time
2006-10-20T07:32:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	good luck with that.
2006-10-20T07:33:00.000Z	ChickenTalons	Cas	if I were you, i'd prepare myself for a HD wipe
2006-10-20T07:33:00.000Z	Cas	ChickenTalons	I think I will replace the whole harddrive, smart already gave me some small errors in the past
