2007-11-19T23:11:00.000Z	albech		anyone else experience gnome freeze when scrolling vertical in firefox?
2007-11-19T23:11:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	you using gutsy?
2007-11-19T23:12:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	yeah, 7.10 = gutsy
2007-11-19T23:12:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	yes
2007-11-19T23:12:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	thats a common problem. last i heard firefox  in gutsy was acting strange all around
2007-11-19T23:13:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	ok, so i should just throw my computer out the window and look TV instead? ;)
2007-11-19T23:13:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	thats one option ;)
2007-11-19T23:14:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	guess i can go back to gentoo, but i really liked ubuntu :(
2007-11-19T23:14:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	I'm using feisty with no problems. Why reinstall your distro because one or two apps are being buggy?
2007-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	im comming from a gentoo install.. but wanted to try out ubuntu and was very suprised to see how well it worked
2007-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	gentoo = compile farm :P
2007-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	exactly
2007-11-19T23:15:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	ubuntu is much more sane in my opinion
2007-11-19T23:16:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	im running gentoo on all my servers, but ubuntu just seems a lot more sensible on a workstation
2007-11-19T23:16:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	guess i should try 7.04
2007-11-19T23:16:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	sounds like a plan to me. Until the firefox bug in gutsy is fixed, why not try another browser?
2007-11-19T23:17:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	or you can downgrade to feisty. Its what i'm using and its rock solid.
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	its causing the system to lock up fairly often though and i cant live with that
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	try opera until its fixed? :P
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	there is nothing but a hard reboot
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	yes i might do that
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	thanks for the input
2007-11-19T23:18:00.000Z	sidlet	albech	np. Glad I could be some help to ya
2007-11-19T23:20:00.000Z	albech	sidlet	Dark: the fun about Ubuntu is that you dont even need the console much
