2005-03-07T06:54:00.000Z	Elsidox		im having werid issuses with mp3s. Beep media player plays them fien but it freezes than plays the mp3s after a little while. Rhythmbox wont even play mp3s
2005-03-07T06:55:00.000Z	andrewski	Elsidox	to play them in rhythmbox, you need gstreamer-mad, IIRC.  i'd recommend mpd just hands-down.
2005-03-07T06:55:00.000Z	andrewski	Elsidox	and, for the record, i got away from xmms/bmp just as quickly as i could; i've not had good experiences from either.
2005-03-07T06:56:00.000Z	Elsidox		gstreamer0.8-mad is already installed
2005-03-07T06:56:00.000Z	Elsidox	andrewski	mpd?
2005-03-07T06:56:00.000Z	andrewski	Elsidox	music player daemon, www.musicpd.org, available in universe. :D
2005-03-07T06:56:00.000Z	andrewski	Elsidox	specifically, if you use gnome, you'll want to check out gmpc as a frontend... if you get that far. :)
2005-03-07T06:57:00.000Z	Elsidox	andrewski	ill check it out
