2011-02-25T08:12:00.000Z	OchoZero9		is there a way to use other computers or laptops as monitors?
2011-02-25T08:14:00.000Z	OchoZero9		i only have a vga out in my laptop and i need more screens
2011-02-25T08:14:00.000Z	OchoZero9		i found  a program for windows
2011-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	OchoZero9		it's called maxvista software
2011-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	OchoZero9		I know i can do the inverse of what i want by having ssl servers on all computers
2011-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	I found something called quicksynergy that can make as many as 5 computers seem to be a single compute by controling they keyboard and mouse of each as if an extension of the screen of the host,  it even work between platform windows and linux
2011-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	I even use it to control my virtualbox that is running on the same system to allow me to cut and paste text between them
2011-02-25T08:19:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	I want to use one app though
2011-02-25T08:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	one app with multi window or just one big screen.  it won't do a big screen but you can run like openoffice and all of them and cut and paste between them
2011-02-25T08:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	who me?  I'm high on life man http://code.google.com/p/quicksynergy/
2011-02-25T08:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	and if you find this on linux let me know http://www.multi-monitors.com/SUPER_PC_Multiple_Monitor_Walls_Multi_screen_Video_Wall_s/5197.htm
2011-02-25T08:59:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	that's pretty sick
2011-02-25T08:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	is sick a good thing?
2011-02-25T09:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	oh maybe slick
2011-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	well I would think you could combine multi X11 servers together into a single host proxy that would direct them all to display something like this
2011-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	in theory one cheap video card can do this
2011-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	well I have all these old computers and monitors around here it would be cool If I could combine them to be something usefull for free not $400
2011-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	ya but now they collect dust
2011-02-25T09:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	I already have two monitors on my desk and use what I showed you,  I would also like to try make them combined as in this case
2011-02-25T09:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	I will find a software solution
2011-02-25T09:11:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	so 3240p  64 inches is $1080
2011-02-25T09:16:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	you nkow what's another idea? having a tablet, ipad or similar
2011-02-25T09:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	OchoZero9	how would that combine them?
2011-02-25T09:21:00.000Z	OchoZero9	sacarlson	my computers has similar features i'm not too informed on the subject though.. Intel Management tools or security
