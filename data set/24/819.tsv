2011-01-09T12:12:00.000Z	potiphera		I've been unable to to boot my system for about a week because GRUB is broken and I haven't been able to fix it; does anyone here know about encrypted filesystems and fixing GRUB from a live CD?
2011-01-09T12:14:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	have you tried supergrubdisc2 to boot/get in and then repair?
2011-01-09T12:14:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	no, I hadn't heard about it.
2011-01-09T12:15:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	its a small is image to search 4 and recover grub2
2011-01-09T12:16:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	I downgraded GRUB to legacy, so will it still work for me?
2011-01-09T12:16:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	i think supergrubdisk is also available.... its just really simple thats all.....
2011-01-09T12:17:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	broken grub you say?
2011-01-09T12:18:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	yeah, it gives me an error saying no init found.
2011-01-09T12:20:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	that sounds like you have edited the kernel boot string and messed up!?
2011-01-09T12:21:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	did you edit /boot/grub/grub.conf manually?
2011-01-09T12:23:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	I downgraded to legacy Grub, and then I think I did sudo update-grub, but then I had to edit menu.lst manually because it had an incorrect pathname for root= since I was running from a live CD chrooted to my encrypted filesystem
2011-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	potiphera		so I had to change root= to the hexadecimal name, although I'm not sure whether I was supposed to change it to the encrypted partition, the boot partition, or what
2011-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	confirm the initrd entry.....
2011-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	just a second, let me open menu.lst.
2011-01-09T12:24:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	oh, ok - encryption.... not sure!!
2011-01-09T12:25:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	initrd line says /initrd.img-2.6.32-27-generic (and similar entries for the different kernels)
2011-01-09T12:25:00.000Z	potiphera		and I tried update-initramfs
2011-01-09T12:26:00.000Z	potiphera		which keeps giving me an error saying "cryptsetup: WARNING: invalid line in /etc/crypttab -".
2011-01-09T12:27:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	encryption = me no know...... do you have no other kernel in the list to boot?
2011-01-09T12:28:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	I do, so I can try them, although the entries are all similar.  Do you know if supergrubdisk will work with an encrypted filesystem?
2011-01-09T12:29:00.000Z	iflema	potiphera	no idea, sorry
2011-01-09T12:29:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	thanks.  I'll read the documentation and see.
2011-01-09T12:32:00.000Z	iflema		!encrypt | potiphera *maybe* something there??
2011-01-09T12:36:00.000Z	potiphera	iflema	thanks, I think this is slightly different because it's full disk encryption.  But I am able to mount the disk using the live CD.  I am going to go read the documentation for supergrubdisk and disk encryption, but thanks again.
