2010-05-20T17:00:00.000Z	histo	raven	I don't know I don't have the same hardware to troubleshoot. Thats why I was suggesting searching ot he forums perhaps someone has a solution. mayb e afirmware / bios update
2010-05-20T17:00:00.000Z	raven	histo	bios update was done
2010-05-20T17:55:00.000Z	raven	histo	phlak_user , acicula i am now running 2.6.31-10-rt and eth0 works
2010-05-20T17:57:00.000Z	histo	raven	okay perhaps you may want to make that the default kernel then if 2.6.32 is causing problems
2010-05-20T17:57:00.000Z	raven	histo	yes how to change the default?
