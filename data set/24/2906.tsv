2008-07-01T04:25:00.000Z	MannyCalavera		Oh, one more thing.ï»¿ When I install the program with "apt-get install mplayer", where is it saved in the Ubuntu partition and how do I run it, eventually put a shortcut in the taskbar?
2008-07-01T04:26:00.000Z	MannyCalavera		oh, silly me. Thank you eljaco!
2008-07-01T04:27:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	the executables are usually in /usr/bin but to run it you normally just use the app anme in a terminal
2008-07-01T04:30:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	it would depend on the app
2008-07-01T04:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	its ok, what app are you referring to?
2008-07-01T04:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	i believe       'mplayer'    would run it from the terminal
2008-07-01T04:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	or theres probably a launcher in    Applications--> Sound&Video--> mplayer
2008-07-01T04:32:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	it does! Yes, and the launcher is there too.
2008-07-01T04:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	if you want a launcher on the desktop or panel just drag and drop from the menu
2008-07-01T04:34:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	yes that's all I know for now, drag and drop and pppoeconf hahaha
2008-07-01T04:35:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	if you have anymore questions, dont hesitate to ask ;~)
2008-07-01T04:41:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	ethernet or wifi?
2008-07-01T04:41:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	ethernet
2008-07-01T04:41:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	try    sudo eth0 down
2008-07-01T04:44:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	thank you for that tip. Would it reset my IP address? How do I get it running again?
2008-07-01T04:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	sudo eth0 up      or the network manager in the top right hand corner of your screen
2008-07-01T04:47:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	use    ifconfig        to find your gateway, if your connected just use the address in your browser as per usual
2008-07-01T04:56:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	I used "ifconfig". It listed eth0, local loopback and Point-to-Point protocol. There were several IP addresses, tried them all in Firefox and it didn't open anything. Can I somehow change the gateway to the ethernet modem?
2008-07-01T04:56:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	have you tried pinging it to see if your connected? do you have the internet?
2008-07-01T04:57:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	pinging what? I have the internet, otherwise I couldn't get to IRC ? :)
2008-07-01T04:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	run this       sudo ping -c 10 192.168.1.1
2008-07-01T04:59:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	it didn't return anything. :-/  but I am connected, firefox works and I downloaded some codecs seconds ago...
2008-07-01T05:00:00.000Z	Bodsda	MannyCalavera	mind if i pm you?
2008-07-01T05:00:00.000Z	MannyCalavera	Bodsda	of course i don't
