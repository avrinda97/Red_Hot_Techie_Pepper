2012-06-07T15:33:00.000Z	DarkSim		Any easy way to restore Ubuntu to how it was when I first installed it?
2012-06-07T15:33:00.000Z	DarkSim		Like a restore point or something?
2012-06-07T15:34:00.000Z	DarkSim		None of them seems to support precise
2012-06-07T15:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	you can use your backups I guess
2012-06-07T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	you make your own backups
2012-07-25T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	sudo apt-get install xfce4
2012-07-25T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	yes, the bare minimum xfce
2012-07-25T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	do you have universe repo enabled?
2012-07-25T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	try: apt-cache policy xfce4
2012-07-25T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	not bad at all, you can install them all if you wish
2012-09-26T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	just install the deb using terminal or double clicking the files.
2012-09-26T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	its pretty minimal with the server kernel really
2012-09-26T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	no, it won't run
2012-09-26T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	you can run 32bit OS on 64bit CPU though
2012-09-26T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	sure you can, unetbootin runs on windows too
2012-09-26T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	there are tonnes of bootable USB creators. Are you serious??

2012-09-26T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2012-09-26T13:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	to name just 2
2012-09-26T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	np
2012-09-26T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	then run:  gksudo nautilus   and you have full file system access.
2012-09-26T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	you don't need to log in as root, not all the processes need to run as root which is what happens when you log in as root
2012-09-26T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	its not just the apps you launch, its the panels and the desktop itself, and the window manager
2012-09-26T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DarkSim	stuff like that, not needed
