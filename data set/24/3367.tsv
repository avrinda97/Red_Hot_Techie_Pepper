2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		Does that necessarily mean that initrd.gz for the gutsy live CD contains the module?
2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		I would assume so, as well
2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		but I'm getting strange errors
2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		I'm netbooting the live CD
2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		I mean, I'm serving the live CD via NFS
2008-02-11T19:19:00.000Z	leeping		and I put the kernel in /var/lib/tftpboot
2008-02-11T19:20:00.000Z	leeping		The computers that I'm trying to boot do not have disk drives
2008-02-11T19:21:00.000Z	leeping		Right, that means adding the correct kernel module in the initrd.gz..
2008-02-11T19:21:00.000Z	leeping		I built it from parts
2008-02-11T19:21:00.000Z	leeping		However I imagine I also have to add the name of the module to a list in order for it to be loaded
2008-02-11T19:22:00.000Z	erawfish	leeping	not really due to the magic of udev
2008-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	leeping	erawfish	Does that mean I only need to put the module in the correct directory?
2008-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	leeping		One more problem - if I compile the kernel module, I'll be compiling with a newer kernel, I think
2008-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	erawfish	leeping	you need to do more
2008-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	leeping		because you just mentioned the live CD uses an older kernel
2008-02-11T19:23:00.000Z	leeping	erawfish	What do I need to do? Or is there a webpage that shows me how?
2008-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	leeping		wow, these ops come from nowhere :)
2008-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	leeping		hahah, and they don't even kick
2008-02-11T19:25:00.000Z	leeping		they make people part
2008-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	leeping		There's a command called mkinitrd, but I don't think I can use it to generate a live CD initrd
2008-02-11T19:27:00.000Z	leeping		because I think the live CD initrd contains scripts that are specific to the live CD .. am I correct?
2008-02-11T19:29:00.000Z	leeping		I guess nobody here really knows how to add a network driver to the initrd.gz on the live CD
2008-02-11T19:30:00.000Z	leeping		what if I bluffed and said I was going to use Windows instead? =D
2008-02-11T19:30:00.000Z	erawfish	leeping	you compile a custom kernel
