2008-04-28T01:19:00.000Z	tokah_		is anyone else on hardy having this mp3 problem, the only on that can play mp3's so far is vlc, which is terrible as a music browser, i have downloaded xmms, but it does even open its gui when i try to run it,
2008-04-28T01:20:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	i play mp3 with Rhythmbox, no problem
2008-04-28T01:20:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	yeah, i used to also, until i upgraded
2008-04-28T01:20:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	keep use it :p
2008-04-28T01:21:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	until i upgraded....
2008-04-28T01:21:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	for some reason it no longer works, although i have installed rrestricted extras
2008-04-28T01:21:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	oh, rhythmbox no longer starts?
2008-04-28T01:22:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	i dont think xmms2 have any gui..
2008-04-28T01:22:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	you can try re-installl rhythmbox and the mp3 codec package
2008-04-28T01:23:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	which one is the mp3 codec package
2008-04-28T01:24:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	im not sure
2008-04-28T01:24:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	perhaps 'gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly'
2008-04-28T01:26:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	install the "GStreamer extra plugins"
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	what do u mean extra, i see good bad ugly no extra
2008-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	open a command line, type: $ 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly'
2008-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	i have that package already and i reinstalled it
2008-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	oh then it should work... =/
2008-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	you have "Ubuntu restricted extras" installed? I don't have that, I have "GStreamer extra plugins"
2008-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	are u on hardy
2008-04-28T01:30:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	yes, 8.04
2008-04-28T01:30:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	that package your talking about is it a medibunut
2008-04-28T01:31:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	I don't use medibunto. I use Ubuntu 8.04, and I have "GStreamer extra plugins"
2008-04-28T01:31:00.000Z	tokah_	smallfoot-	medibuntu isnt a distro its a package libary
2008-04-28T01:32:00.000Z	smallfoot-	tokah_	oh... i don't think i have it
