2005-04-10T12:53:00.000Z	holycow		next stable should be when approximately?
2005-04-10T12:53:00.000Z	holycow		oh so in a few months then? cool
2005-04-10T12:54:00.000Z	holycow		from the sounds of that i may as well just install hoary and wait to dist upgrade when it is released as stable?
2005-04-10T12:54:00.000Z	holycow		okay cool
2005-04-10T12:54:00.000Z	holycow		thanks guys
2005-04-10T12:56:00.000Z	holycow		i guess it's time to give it a run on this workstation
2005-04-10T12:57:00.000Z	holycow		so based on the hoary page, ubuntu focuses on x86 and powerpc architectures then?
2005-04-10T12:58:00.000Z	holycow		thats cool, most users are on the other architectures
2005-04-10T12:59:00.000Z	holycow		oh one other thing, i know ubuntu tries to stay as close to debian as possible only forking stuff temporarily until the changes make it back to debian ....
2005-04-10T13:00:00.000Z	holycow		how does one install debian proper stuff on ubuntu as it is based on unstable right?  there must be breakage out there?
2005-04-10T13:00:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	You install stuff from Universe.
2005-04-10T13:00:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	(which is all the software that Ubuntu packages but doesn't officially support.)
2005-04-29T16:22:00.000Z	holycow	resiak	synaptic has a repositories dialog?
2005-04-29T16:23:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	My version does...
2005-04-29T05:09:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	The former is true, the latter is debateable.
2005-04-29T05:10:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	I presume you know about GreaseMonkey and the unembed script?
2005-04-29T05:11:00.000Z	holycow	resiak	actually i dont, googling now tho :)
2005-04-29T05:12:00.000Z	holycow	resiak	no shit, wow

2005-05-05T10:55:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	Is gnome-system-tools in Ubuntu?
2005-05-05T10:56:00.000Z	holycow	resiak	yep
2005-05-05T10:56:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	So there's your gui right there.
2005-05-05T10:56:00.000Z	resiak	holycow	Oh, wait, it doesn't have a runlevel bit. Sorry :)
