2008-02-18T02:56:00.000Z	Stagger		hello, when i play videos the images are really low-quality, kinda blurry. what should i do? thanks
2008-02-18T02:58:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	what file format?
2008-02-18T03:00:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	I use VLC, but with Totem it's even worse
2008-02-18T03:00:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	i mean, what format is the video you're trying to play? perhaps your video output is set correctly, or you're using the wrong drivers
2008-02-18T03:01:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	that happens with .avi and DVD discs too
2008-02-18T03:02:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	what video card have you got?
2008-02-18T03:03:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	i am ashamed to say i have no idea. where to i see it?
2008-02-18T03:03:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	one moment
2008-02-18T03:04:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	Intel 945
2008-02-18T03:04:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver
2008-02-18T03:04:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	oh, you found your way. intel 945 isn't properly supported in ubuntu 7.10. its a bit too new
2008-02-18T03:05:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	you're probably using vesa drivers, and they don't work at the cards full speed. that's why.
2008-02-18T03:05:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	so no solutionbut wait for this to be fixed?
2008-02-18T03:05:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	your best best will be ubuntu 8.04
2008-02-18T03:06:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	sort of. i'm not even sure if there are drivers out there.
2008-02-18T03:06:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	i feel your pain...
2008-02-18T03:06:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	:)
2008-02-18T03:07:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	drivers for 945 should be released at some point right? Or is there a way I can beg the community to work on it?
2008-02-18T03:07:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	the community is working on it: www.intellinuxgraphics.org or is it .com???
2008-02-18T03:08:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	sooner than you might expect. haven't played with ubuntu hardy, so i don't know if its already in there somewhere
2008-02-18T03:08:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	good! I'll patiently wait. I am new to linux, it took me forever to switch and now i can give the guys some time. thanks for your help, at least no i now!
2008-02-18T03:09:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	I meant now i know ;)
2008-02-18T03:09:00.000Z	Stagger	nucco	thanks for your precious help
2008-02-18T03:09:00.000Z	nucco	Stagger	you're welcome. (i know) :)) i had issues with my ATI X1600 too when i got a new laptop.
