2010-03-13T23:30:00.000Z	Code-E		I'm trying to enable desktop effects.. But it is telling me "Desktop effects cannot be enabled" Does this mean my video card drivers are not installed or something?
2010-03-13T23:30:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	this or your card isn't capable of it
2010-03-13T23:31:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	my card is an ati 3100. It's an onboard card for laptops. Would it be capable of it? O_o
2010-03-13T23:32:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	I google it, minute
2010-03-13T23:34:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	capable it is, did you install a  propitary driver ?
2010-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	i have not installed any video driver since i installed ubuntu.
2010-03-13T23:36:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	and I haven't tried latest propitary from ati yet, can try that on your own risk, but also I have to admit that I have no experience with that card at all
2010-03-13T23:38:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	How am I to run a .run file?
2010-03-13T23:39:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	sudo sh atiblah.run
2010-03-13T23:50:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	I installed the driver and now my mouse has disappeared O_o
2010-03-13T23:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	linux-headers installed ?
2010-03-13T23:52:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	Im not sure, should I install it?
2010-03-13T23:52:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	I guess its not. Im installing it now
2010-03-13T23:53:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	generic kernel ?
2010-03-13T23:54:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	i guess its 2.6.31-304
2010-03-13T23:55:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic
2010-03-13T23:55:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	unless you run the server or another version
2010-03-13T23:57:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	Okay, the headers is installed. What can i do to get my mouse to come back? O_o
2010-03-13T23:58:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg_backup
2010-03-13T23:59:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	alright, thats done
2010-03-13T23:59:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-03-14T00:00:00.000Z	DasEi	Code-E	this will have destroyed your driver, but we'll get it back soon: sudo reboot
2010-03-14T00:01:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	Okay, I did that.
2010-03-14T00:08:00.000Z	Code-E	DasEi	my power went out there, but the problem is still persisting that my mouse is disappeared
