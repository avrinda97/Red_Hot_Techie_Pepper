2008-05-27T00:48:00.000Z	ariqz		what is the dir /s filename.* version for linux?
2008-05-27T00:48:00.000Z	ariqz		yes
2008-05-27T00:48:00.000Z	ariqz		ltmodem is a martian modem driver
2008-05-27T00:49:00.000Z	ariqz		err
2008-05-27T00:49:00.000Z	ariqz		other way around ;p
2008-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	ariqz		i load it with modprobe in rc.local
2008-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	ariqz		i also run martian_modem
2008-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	ariqz		but then I need root to use it
2008-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	ariqz		which is aggravating
2008-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	what exactly do you have to run as root?
2008-05-27T00:30:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	I'm not clear what you want to achieve...
2008-05-27T00:45:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	I got my modem drivers compiled finally, and they work, but they require root permission because I have to run something to load the module
2008-05-27T00:46:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	I don't want to type in my pass just to connect.
2008-05-27T00:46:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	what I was thinking though, is if I change permissions on the thing I have to run that loads the module, how would I do that? I can't find it for some reason. I know it exists, but when I search file system with search, it doesn't show it
2008-05-27T00:48:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	if the name of the module was ltmodem, you could just do a 'echo ltmodem | sudo tee -a /etc/modules' to have it loaded at boot time
2008-05-27T00:49:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	do you insert it with modprobe at the moment?
2008-05-27T00:51:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	wvdial, gnome-ppp
2008-05-27T00:51:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	you only need to run those once, no? After that you can connect with 'pon provider'.
2008-05-27T00:54:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	what happens when you configure your ppp connection, then try to use it with pon?
2008-05-27T00:56:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	what do you get from 'ls -l /dev/ttySM0'?
2008-05-27T01:00:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	a whole mess of junk I can't remember all of. :P
2008-05-27T01:00:00.000Z	soundray	ariqz	you're making it a real pleasure to help you. Have a good day\
2008-05-27T01:01:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	the computer is in a whole other room, it doesn't have irc installed or anything, so I could download it, get on in there and you'd be gone by then anyway
2008-05-27T01:03:00.000Z	ariqz	soundray	what a twerp. Let me help you, but first tell me all the contents of your hd memorized in binary format
