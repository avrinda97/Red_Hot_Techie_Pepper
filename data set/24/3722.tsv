2007-12-31T06:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	do you need dual screen, vga, dvi, etc?.. what do you actually need in a card
2007-12-31T06:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	well, Linux pretty much sucks for games....
2007-12-31T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	most games are Windows games.
2007-12-31T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	wine is very hit/miss, mostly miss.
2007-12-31T06:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	best thing to do, is dual boot if you want to game...
2007-12-31T06:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	it might work, but there's a good chance
2008-01-26T02:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	how big is your third partition
2008-01-26T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	thats an absurd amount of space for swap... swap, should usually be 1.5-2x system ram
2008-01-26T02:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	what *I* would do, delete the third partition, and have 1 big second partition, start the installer, and choose to let ubuntu install to the empty partition, once it does that, the installer will automatically set up a swap system for you..
2008-01-26T02:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	unless you have some other reason for that third parttion taht i don't know.
2008-01-26T02:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	how big is partition 2?
2008-01-26T02:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	guess its jsut a matter of opinion, but i dont' think i' do it like that
2008-01-26T02:25:00.000Z	Task	IndyGunFreak	  If I do... bot OS's can use that space?
2008-01-26T02:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	use what space?
2008-01-26T02:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	if you really want to setup a system like that, it sounds like you'll probably be OK, depending on how much stuff you stick on Partition 2.
2008-01-26T02:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	but i would put swap and on partition 2.
2008-01-26T02:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	i'm not sure how successful you'll be w/ Windows and Linux sharing programs though.., never tried it, maybet ahts why what you're saying makes no sense to me.
2008-01-26T02:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Task	i just tried what your'e wanting to do, and i don't think thats gonna work.
