2009-12-15T08:51:00.000Z	LizardK|ng		is there a way to migrate my wubi install to a regular dualboot install?
2009-12-15T08:51:00.000Z	LizardK|ng		hi Roasted
2009-12-15T08:52:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	so you finally changed your mind :P
2009-12-15T08:52:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	no, i want to try it out :P
2009-12-15T08:53:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	 can i convert, or will i need to reinstall ubuntu?
2009-12-15T08:55:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	any suggestions?
2009-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	i was reading about lvpm but i honestly think i'll be better off simply backing up my smb.conf and reinstalling
2009-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	what do u use smaba for
2009-12-15T09:14:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	sharing files with a windows computer
2009-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	why not just reconfigure it after upgrade?
2009-12-15T09:18:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	so i know its right
2009-12-15T09:18:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	samba config is fairly straightforward, tick share set permission and thats it
2009-12-15T09:19:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	i must have done it the hard way by editing smb.conf
2009-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	if you have windows, IMO, paragon partition manager, or partition magic would be better than gparted (IMO)
2009-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	are they free and how are they better?  they will 100% require a reboot, as i'd need to boot into windows :P
2009-12-15T10:15:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	no they are not free...
2009-12-15T10:16:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	but i'd still need to reboo
2009-12-15T10:16:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	yes.... you will need to reboot in order to resize the partition because it is in use
2009-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	i'd need to reboot because i'd have to boot into windows to use them
2009-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	yes, obviously... dont use wine for a process like that
2009-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	or virtualbox
2009-12-15T10:39:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	partion magic does all that for u
2009-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	LizardK|ng	[ae86]	i will not be using PM
2009-12-15T10:40:00.000Z	[ae86]	LizardK|ng	ok
