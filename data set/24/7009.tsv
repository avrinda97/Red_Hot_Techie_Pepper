2006-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ \ls -l ./install
2006-11-02T15:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	it means it doesn't have execute permissions for your user
2006-11-02T15:11:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	chmod a+rx ./install
2006-11-02T15:14:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	paste me the result of this command: \ls -l ./install
2006-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	I missed the part about a loopback mounted ISO image
2006-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	ISO9660 filesystems are read-only, so the "chmod" command wouldn't have done anything.  that is already executable, they most likely screwed up the shebang line (first line of the script, which tells it how to run)
2006-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	try specifying a shell to run the script with, e.g.: sudo bash install
2006-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	I mean "bash ./install"
2006-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	otherwise it will look in your $PATH for "install"
2006-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	I get this shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ sudo bash ./install
2006-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	I am starting from scratch. Can u help me make scripts executable. I am trying this reply #3 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=149963&highlight=bin+cue
2006-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	your ISO image is already fine
2006-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	just go: sudo bash ./install
2006-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	if that doesn't work, paste me the error message
2006-11-02T15:24:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	ok let me see
2006-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	whats wrong with this command sudo chmod 700 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/*.*
2006-11-02T15:25:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	I just am redoing the scripts again
2006-11-02T15:26:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	nothing is wrong with it, except on UNIX filesystems "dots" are not always used, so that should be: ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/*
2006-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	this is what I am getting shiv@shiv-laptop:/media/MathWorks_R14_1$ sudo bash ./install
2006-11-02T15:29:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	okay, so it is telling you not to run it from the CD.  switch to another directory and then run it like: sudo bash /media/MathWorks_R14_1/install
2006-11-02T15:30:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	ahha that worked :)
2006-11-02T15:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	shiv	good
2006-11-02T15:30:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	but I have messed up my mount unmount iso scripts
2006-11-02T15:31:00.000Z	shiv	Samus_Aran	this is not working sudo chmod 700 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/*
