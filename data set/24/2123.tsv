2009-04-06T19:13:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	let's step back a bit. on the switch your machine is plugged into, are there link lights verifying the connection?
2009-04-06T19:11:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	sorry about that. local network problems of my own, it seems.
2009-04-06T19:12:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	i get the same notice on my machine :-)
2009-04-06T19:14:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	does it work if you boot the machine from a live cd?
2009-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	is this a new install, by the way?
2009-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	what were you running before?
2009-04-06T19:18:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	moodle?
2009-04-06T19:18:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	which version of ubuntu were you running when it was working?
2009-04-06T19:19:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	so what did you differently between that install and this?
2009-04-06T19:19:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	well, there must be some difference.
2009-04-06T19:20:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	try the live cd, that will at least narrow the problem down.
2009-04-06T19:40:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	sorry, had to be away. glad that it works with the live cd, that's a very good sign.
2009-04-06T19:41:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	nope
2009-04-06T19:42:00.000Z	sipior_	zilleplus	no, and my officemates wouldn't appreciate it, either :-)
