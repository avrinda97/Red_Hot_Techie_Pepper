2007-03-05T17:47:00.000Z	ekul`		Hey i just installed ubuntu -- really a linux newbie wondering if i might be able to get some help on a few things, first of all I downloaded skype for linux, but i have no idea how to install it and running the .deb just gives me an error..

2007-03-05T17:48:00.000Z	shriphani	ekul`	this is a ubuntu installation right ?
2007-03-05T17:48:00.000Z	ekul`		my other problem is with scrolling, it is really slow and it puts lines across the screen whenever i scroll a webpage or here in chat. Any idea what that might be? graphics driver?
