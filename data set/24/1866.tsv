2009-07-16T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	you want to edit the source code yourself?
2009-07-16T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	you should contact the developer
2009-07-16T18:57:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	if it's the only way, than yes
2009-07-16T18:58:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	I had it yet... He didn't answered (excuse me for the bad english)
2009-07-16T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	What do you want to do?
2009-07-16T18:59:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	I'm asking you!
2009-07-16T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	well is it open source?
2009-07-16T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	what application is this exactly?
2009-07-16T19:02:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	it's here: http://blacklight.gotdns.org/blog/    look for "JASTEGAL"
2009-07-16T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	well you have the code then, if the developer is unresponsive and you want to play with the source code, go for it
2009-07-16T19:04:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	I know, but I don't know where do I start from! I'm not a programmer (i'm learning)
2009-07-16T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	try the channel for the language it is written in, they will give you tutorial so you can learn the language
2009-07-16T19:05:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	uff... ok thanks
2009-07-25T20:02:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	are you an op?
2009-07-25T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	why?
2012-09-06T23:04:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	why not use 12.04? :/
2012-09-06T23:05:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	Because I fell in love with Lucid, Don't wanna leave it
2012-09-06T23:05:00.000Z	jrib	nannes	... ok
2012-09-06T23:08:00.000Z	nannes	jrib	wilee-nilee: Jokes apart, I need to install it on Lucid cause I can't update now, because I have many configs and many progs compiled by sources which take long time to reinstall, and i'm not even sure that they'd work on precise
