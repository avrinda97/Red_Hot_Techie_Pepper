2005-07-18T06:39:00.000Z	CzarAlex		I have ubuntu installed on a 4 gig hd (set as master on IDE 1) I have a 15 gig hd formatted with NTFS with some old windows files (set as slave on IDE 1) How do I encorporate that HD in to my file system?
2005-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hdb1 ?
2005-07-18T06:41:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	lemme check that out. Those commands are all new to me.
2005-07-18T06:43:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	how do i know if i should use mkfs.reiserfs or mkfs.ext3?
2005-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	do df -T
2005-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	 so I want to: mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1
2005-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	yes.. that will format it.. you will need to put a sudo before that to do it as root
2005-07-18T06:48:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	what do I refer to this new drive as when using the mount command?
2005-07-18T06:49:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/mountpoint
2005-07-18T06:49:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	hmm. I didnt create any dir's yet.

2005-07-18T06:52:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	strange. it only used 4gigs of the 15 possible.

2005-07-18T06:57:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	nah.. I've nuked wrong partitions by accident with fdisk.. much better to see what you are doing :)

2005-07-18T07:02:00.000Z	Nermal	CzarAlex	erm,... you selected the right disk in the drop down list at the top right ?
2005-07-18T07:03:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	I should just wear a diaper. Im such a baby :) Found it. (the drive...not the diaper)

2005-07-18T07:10:00.000Z	CzarAlex	Nermal	create this new drive as primary or extended partition (Does primary mean itll replace my main drive that ubuntu is located on?)
