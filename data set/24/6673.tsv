2007-02-13T12:46:00.000Z	Eleaf		ahh!  My printer stopped working ;(
2007-02-13T12:46:00.000Z	Eleaf		It was printing just a second ago, but now when I try to print, the printer says "Put letter, standard paper in tray 1"
2007-02-13T12:46:00.000Z	Eleaf		There is paper.
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf		Printing is so bad in linux...
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Eleaf	there's paper in the printer?
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf	cables	??
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf		yes zcat[1] 
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf		zcat[1] , windows prints fine .
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf		I tried resetting up the printer, but it still doesn't print.
2007-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	Eleaf		I have a huge project due very soon.
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	Eleaf	cables	it's too hard to get all my data over there..
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	Eleaf		I have like 20 files
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	Eleaf	cables	that's rediculous.
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	Eleaf		And why does linux not have that many options for quality?
2007-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	Eleaf		(cups)
2007-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	Eleaf		cableroy, because it was working 1 minute ago
2007-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	Eleaf		I try to change the quality and it doesn't work..  I put all the settings back.
2007-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	Eleaf		It's the middle of the night, and the printer with linux is always the weakest part.
2007-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Eleaf	did you change anything in the app you're printing from (like paper size) that might make it think it's supposed to use a different paper source?
2007-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	Eleaf		zcat[1] , it can't even do a test print.
2007-02-13T12:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		zcat[1] , so I don't believe so.
2007-02-13T12:50:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		that is weird.
2007-02-13T12:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		grr
2007-02-13T12:51:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Eleaf	sounds like your easiest option for now is just to copy the files to Windows.. :(
