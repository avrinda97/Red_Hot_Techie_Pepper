2010-09-08T11:24:00.000Z	p1oooop		yes.
2010-09-08T11:25:00.000Z	p1oooop		my network consists of 2 gateways
2010-09-08T11:25:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	can you ping a DNS server, like 8.8.8.8 ?
2010-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	it is possible.  is ubuntu acting as the 'router' in your configuration? or is there an actual router?
2010-09-08T11:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	rdw200169	I'm using a ubuntu router
2010-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	well, you could make your life easy and NAT the internal-internal network into the internal network, then, ensuring you have a default route than points to the interface that runs into your internal network, everything should work
2010-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	this implies, of course, that no one on the internal network will be able to see anyone on the internal-internal network direclty
2010-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	p1oooop	rdw200169	that's what I did...
2010-09-08T11:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	yeah, we diagnosed that that was going to be an issue if you can't ping outside the internal-internal network
2010-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	p1oooop	rdw200169	I can, but I cannot ping outside of the internal network...
2010-09-08T11:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	yeah, i would have done it with ip, but that works too
2010-09-08T11:39:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	perhaps you would have more luck with: sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev ethX
2010-09-08T11:41:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	but you need to make sure that the 192.168.0.0/24 network is referenced in your route table...
2010-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	p1oooop	rdw200169	I must apologize to you and iter and ilovefairuz
2010-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	quite alright
2010-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	rdw200169	p1oooop	it works :) ! :)
