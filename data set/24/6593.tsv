2006-10-28T08:36:00.000Z	BryanJ		can someone help?
2006-10-28T08:37:00.000Z	BryanJ		kay, when I install ubuntu, the installer crashes like half way through...
2006-10-28T08:37:00.000Z	BryanJ		Can someone help me install Ubuntu?
2006-10-28T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	what do you need help with?
2006-10-28T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	what speed did you burn it?  this is the Desktop CD I imagine?
2006-10-28T08:39:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	try reburning at 4x
2006-10-28T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	by clicking on the install button, however if that's failing, and you're sure it's a good burn, you migh try the alternate CD, it's an older (rock solid) installer
2006-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	the slowest possible.  Although, you may want to think about downloading the alternate CD, it's been tested a lot more (years more)
2006-10-28T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	right, the alternate CD.  instead of being a liveCD, it's just an installer
2006-10-28T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	ubuntu.com/download
2006-10-28T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	same place you got the 'desktop' but get the 'alternate'
2006-10-28T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	correct.  Just no liveCD, just an installer.
2006-10-28T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	the "Alternate" CD, click 'more versions' or whatever, and it'll give you a big list of lots of stuff
2006-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	that's for 6.06, did you want 6.06 or 6.10?
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	then that's not the right one.  Let me get you a direct link
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	they moved some stuff around, made it difficult to find stuff, hang on a sec
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	what country?
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	download that, burn it at 4x, boot it
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	4x is fine ;)
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	there's just some caching that goes on at faster than 4x on newer drives, does a number on ISOs
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	half hour or so? I suppose Ive never really kept track
2006-10-28T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	BryanJ	it's not too long ;)
