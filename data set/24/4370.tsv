2007-04-29T10:25:00.000Z	Tsuamia		does anyone know a good gnome c++ compiler I can get from the app installer?
2007-04-29T10:27:00.000Z	Tsuamia		burner: where can I get gcc?
2007-04-29T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	sudo apt-get install gcc
2007-04-29T10:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	sudo apt-get install g++
2007-04-29T10:31:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	how do I run it?
2007-04-29T10:32:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	run what? that command, open a terminal and do "sudo apt-get install g++"
2007-04-29T10:32:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	it is command line
2007-04-29T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	something like "g++ -o whatever whatever.cc" for instance will compile whatever.cc and output the binary whatever. You can do man g++ for a more thorough explanation of options
2007-04-29T10:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	or you can install an ide that allows to compile within it. I personally like geany.
2007-04-29T10:35:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	where do I get geany?
2007-04-29T10:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	sudo apt-get install geany
2007-04-29T10:36:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	awesome thanks
2007-04-29T10:39:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	does geany let me make a new project or just files.. or is that a dumb question?
2007-04-29T10:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	by new project what do you mean?
2007-04-29T10:40:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	I have never worked with c++,I am gonna learn today, but my brother knows it and he said I need to make a new project not a new file
2007-04-29T10:40:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	oh that may be because c++ is object oriented. I have never used c++
2007-04-29T10:41:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	yeah it is probably that. will ask him about it, thanks
2007-04-29T11:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	you can resize a partition by taking space off the end and you can resize partitions by adding space on the end. Otherwise, must format
2007-04-29T11:24:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	so I can't make new partitions now? didn't think so
2007-04-29T11:24:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	you can make new partitions if you have free space
2007-04-29T11:24:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	I have one partition taking up the whole drive, so can I make a new partition?
2007-04-29T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	you can resize that by taking space off the end and then create a new partition out of the space freed up
2007-04-29T11:25:00.000Z	Tsuamia	bruenig	Cool, how do I do that?
2007-04-29T11:25:00.000Z	bruenig	Tsuamia	you have to use the live cd
