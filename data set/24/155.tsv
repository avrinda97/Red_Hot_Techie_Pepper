2012-08-11T08:49:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	Extended?
2012-08-11T08:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	you have 4 primary partitions on that HD, the max allowed
2012-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	look closer I see no sdb
2012-08-11T08:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	you have sda1,2,3 and 4
2012-08-11T08:25:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	Not sure why this has so many partitions; I haven't created any. I don't think Wubi makes one, though, right?
2012-08-11T08:27:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	looks like boot partition is sda1, OEM's quite often have 4 partitions
2012-08-11T08:27:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	Alright, so do I overwrite sda1?
2012-08-11T08:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	that is way to small and would crash the boot, is the computer completely backed up=cloned and do you have a install or recovery disc?
2012-08-11T08:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	Yep standard oem install.
2012-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	oem?
2012-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	manufacturers install.
2012-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	Okay, but just out of curiousity, what does it stand for?
2012-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	Relondo	wilee-nilee	So is the "System" partition the bootloader? Can I put Grub on there?
2012-08-11T08:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	Go to the ubuntu forum if you can't get exacting help here, I believe the firm ware sda4, can be put in a extended, so that you can delete it and put a extended in with some shrinking of other partitions, for the ubuntu and swap partitions, I have seen that advised, but confirm this.
2012-08-11T08:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	a extended partition allows you to use logical partitions and get past the 4 primary partition limit linux will run this way windows wont without some tweaking that I would not bother with, but supposedly the firmware partition sda4 can.
2012-08-11T08:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	most like the boot is on both so you can run the recovery
2012-08-11T08:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	we could see, but removing sda1 would mean you would have to do partition moving that may brick the windows.
2012-08-11T08:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	hard to say exactly different manufacturers set them up differently, most likely it has the /bootmgr /Boot/BCD /  and is tied to the recovery
2012-08-11T08:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	grub will pick it up it is whether you will be able to run the recovery I would worry about. Do you have a clone of the W& and a recovery or install disc?
2012-08-11T08:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	it is not data loss it is having a backup in case you can not access the recovery.
2012-08-11T08:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	If it was me, I would clone it, remove the recovery partition, put a extended in its place and install ubuntu there.
2012-08-11T08:59:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	clonezilla will only clone the data, and the mbr but needs a same size partition for reinstall.
2012-08-11T09:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	I would not mess with it tell you do have a cloned backup, or if you want to buy a disc and risk losing stuff in the future have at it. A recdovery partition is not the best insurance as well, it can get infected since it is on the same HD.
2012-08-11T09:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Relondo	not install on the recovery partition remove it when you have a good clone and make a extended, where it was.
