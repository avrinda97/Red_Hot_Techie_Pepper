2010-02-08T04:15:00.000Z	Arsin		Can someone help me out with Folding@Home?
2010-02-08T04:17:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	what CPU do you have? Folding@Home can be take quite a while, and if your using other programs at the same time, F@H gets to use less
2010-02-08T04:18:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	a PIV 516? :) Same as me, F@H runs fine :) I can't remember exactly how many points per day though
2010-02-08T04:18:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	How do I check my points? And also do I need to register on the site or?
2010-02-08T04:20:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	you can go on their site and search for your username, or install something like F@H monitor. There's a really good guide for installing it on UBuntu, if you give me a sec I'll find it for you

2010-02-08T04:24:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	Thanks
2010-02-08T04:24:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	NP mate :)
2010-02-08T04:25:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	I never made a pass key since I didn't register anywhere, what's that all about?
2010-02-08T04:27:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	where exactly is that?
2010-02-08T04:27:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	When I opened F@H VIA terminal it asked for a passkey
2010-02-08T04:28:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	what command did you use to start F@H? Have you it installed as a daemon?
2010-02-08T04:29:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	I haven't installed anything, downloaded and just ran it as "sudo ~/Desktop/Folding@Home/fah6"
2010-02-08T04:31:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	ok, did some Googling. It appears that the passkey is just used if you register your username, to stop anyone else using it. If you don't care, try leaing it blank
2010-02-08T04:31:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	Where can I register?
2010-02-08T04:32:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	your registering by just give it a username and password when you run it
2010-02-08T04:33:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	or when you install it even. Does it ask for a username when you run the script directly?
2010-02-08T04:33:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	It asks for user/passkey/team#
2010-02-08T04:35:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	if you don't care about a username just leave the user and password blank. If you want to be known as whatever, give it a username. If you want noone else to be able to use that username, give it a password. Simple as, you don't need to register anywhere :) Just make sure you use team 45104 ;)
2010-02-08T04:36:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	Who is 45104? I'm currently on overclock.net's team
2010-02-08T04:37:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	its team ubuntu :)
2010-02-08T04:40:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	far as I know you need to run F@H. Fahmon just reads and show data from the logs
2010-02-08T04:42:00.000Z	Arsin	the_real_dave	Hmm. My progress is N/A what's up with that?
2010-02-08T04:42:00.000Z	the_real_dave	Arsin	you need to add and configure the clients
