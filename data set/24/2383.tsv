2009-01-07T09:02:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	your printer is supported: http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/models/laserjet/hp_laserjet_1020.html - go to Ubuntu menu Applications > Accessories > Terminal and execute: sudo hp-setup
2009-01-07T09:03:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	It will ask you for your password, type it there and press Enter
2009-01-07T09:03:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	then allow it to download from the internet an add-on or firmware.. whatever it calls it, that should fix it
2009-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	mr_sukor	savvas	ok thanks :)
2009-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	np :)

2009-01-07T09:10:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	shut down your printer - then shut down your computer. Power on your printer and power on your computer. Check it then.
2009-01-07T09:11:00.000Z	mr_sukor	savvas	warning: hp-testpage should not be run as root.

2009-01-07T09:16:00.000Z	mr_sukor	savvas	:  what is the best to make a partition on 20GB HDD?
2009-01-07T09:17:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	using gparted: sudo apt-get install gparted ..and then go to System > Administration > Partition Editor
2009-01-07T09:18:00.000Z	savvas	mr_sukor	if the hard drive is in use by the system, then you won't be able to partition it, you have to use and boot from the Live CD for that
2009-01-07T09:19:00.000Z	mr_sukor	savvas	i'm trying to set it as boot, home and to store some file
