2007-11-16T03:47:00.000Z	Kiloblaster		godscape i was running winzozz vista on it and it was going quite well...now i want to use Ubuntu...but it goes slow when i boot :(
2007-11-16T03:48:00.000Z	Godscape	Kiloblaster	so you have very new specs then?  What Ubuntu are you using?

2007-11-16T03:51:00.000Z	Godscape	Kiloblaster	that's odd.  How long does it take to boot up?  Live CD or Hard Drive?
2007-11-16T03:52:00.000Z	Kiloblaster	Godscape	yeah it's odd... i installed it on my hard drive... it takes about 3 or more minutes to show me the login screen... it's all black...then it cames up and works well...i have just installed compiz but i wanted some help about the slowing problem before i restart one more time ;)
2007-11-16T03:53:00.000Z	Godscape	Kiloblaster	was it fine before Compiz?
2007-11-16T03:53:00.000Z	Kiloblaster		godscape no
2007-11-16T03:54:00.000Z	Kiloblaster	Godscape	got any clue?
2007-11-16T03:54:00.000Z	Godscape	Kiloblaster	I'd like to help, I'm not sure how, though.
2007-11-16T03:56:00.000Z	Kiloblaster		godscape ok ok thanks anyway--- you know it's my first experience on linux based system installed :D:D i am so excited about switching to ubuntu from vista... i only hope i wont have to wait so long every time i turn on the notebook :D
2007-11-16T03:56:00.000Z	Godscape	Kiloblaster	hope to see you around later.
2007-11-16T03:57:00.000Z	Kiloblaster	Godscape	you count on it ;) now i reboot to see if compiz works well... then i would try with beryl...what is best in your opinion?
