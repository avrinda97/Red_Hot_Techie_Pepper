2008-01-04T07:32:00.000Z	iCEifer		can anyone think why my resolution is set correctly but the display is not taking up the whole LCD? if I change the refresh rate to 75 HZ it takes up the whole LCD but my LCD says out of range?
2008-01-04T07:33:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	I'm assuming that the LCD is connected via a 15-pin VGA cable and not a DVI, correct?
2008-01-04T07:33:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	yes.
2008-01-04T07:34:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	1440x900 at 60Hz is the native res....Envision 19" Wide LCD....someone told me my BusID might be wrong and I did a grep command and got this, 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller....and my line is set to  BusID  "PCI:0:2:0"
2008-01-04T07:34:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Not too familiar with the BusID, maybe someone else is here.
2008-01-04T07:35:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	would the VGA cable be an issue?
2008-01-04T07:35:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Well, with DVI, the refresh rate doesn't matter (to the best of my knowledge), but as far as the VGA cable being related to the BusID, def. not.
2008-01-04T07:36:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Let me take a peek at my xorg, hold on.
2008-01-04T07:37:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	k, thanks.
2008-01-04T07:38:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the BusID shouldn't matter; it depends on the slot. Hmmmm
2008-01-04T07:39:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Did you try changing the refresh rate in your xorg.conf ?
2008-01-04T07:39:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	you mean the vsync and horiz rates? yeah
2008-01-04T07:40:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	What video card?
2008-01-04T07:41:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	Intel Corporation 82945G/GZ Integrated Graphics Controller
2008-01-04T07:42:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	Does this happen to be an HP Pavilion?
2008-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	no...Dell Optiplex
2008-01-04T07:43:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	ok, I just googled the chipset and got a few hits back on discussions wrt the same symptoms
2008-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	really?
2008-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	so it's the video card and not the LCD?
2008-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	It looks like xorg settings to me, but you might want to search the forums.
2008-01-04T07:45:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	what did you search under google?
2008-01-04T07:46:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	either "Ubuntu Gutsy Intel 82945G refresh rate" or "Ubuntu Intel 82945G refresh rate"
2008-01-04T07:47:00.000Z	RB2	iCEifer	sry I couldn't be more help.
2008-01-04T07:48:00.000Z	iCEifer	RB2	np...thanks
