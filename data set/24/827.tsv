2011-01-03T03:15:00.000Z	ubuntu		okay, well i've successfully installed ubuntu, and but i cant boot it because of errors ive been getting
2011-01-03T03:15:00.000Z	ubuntu		now ive researched these errors so don't tell me to research
2011-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	msandoy	ubuntu	How far in the boot process does your computer go?
2011-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	ubuntu		i get to the grub bootloader
2011-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	ubuntu		i boot the normal linux boot or whatever
2011-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	msandoy	ubuntu	Is your setup a dual boot?
2011-01-03T03:17:00.000Z	ubuntu		yes it is... running along side windows 7
2011-01-03T03:18:00.000Z	ubuntu		im on the livecd right now if that helps
2011-01-03T03:18:00.000Z	ubuntu		but i always seem to be getting these looping errors, and it ALWAYS takes forever to load into the livecd, or install.
2011-01-03T03:18:00.000Z	ubuntu		like status {DRDY ERR} error: {UNC}
2011-01-03T03:19:00.000Z	ubuntu		something to do with media error <F>
2011-01-03T03:19:00.000Z	ubuntu		thats my cd-rom drive
2011-01-03T03:19:00.000Z	msandoy	ubuntu	Ok, so it actually works from the cd, but not from the installed version. Did you do a dual install, or WUBI?
2011-01-03T03:19:00.000Z	ubuntu		but im booting this all from my toshiba usb external HDD
2011-01-03T03:19:00.000Z	ubuntu	msandoy	i've installed the image to a external usb HDD so its all off my usb
2011-01-03T03:20:00.000Z	ubuntu		but i get this repeating media error loop <F>
2011-01-03T03:20:00.000Z	ubuntu		and thats my cd-rom drive
2011-01-03T03:21:00.000Z	ubuntu		wait ill paste the error...

2011-01-03T03:27:00.000Z	msandoy	ubuntu	It seems like you have some kind of physical damage to your disk. Try to run e2fsck on it from the live cd.
