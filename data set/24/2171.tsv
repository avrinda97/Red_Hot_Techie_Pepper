2009-08-07T05:01:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud: thanks
2009-08-07T05:01:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	np
2009-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	you got your codecs?
2009-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud: I've gotta learn how to use that thing....
2009-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud: ... good, bad, and ugly, or renamed equivalent? yes
2009-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		it plays, it just plays crappy :-)
2009-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	stuff like wmv. codecs
2009-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud, i might, but i have no clue, really. Almost everything I have is mp3s. I should look at that more closely, though, that's a point I hadn't really looked at too close
2009-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	so, video is a problem?
2009-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud The actual video plays, but the sound will skip a bit sometimes
2009-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	you on 9.04?
2009-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue		thiebaud yes
2009-08-07T05:05:00.000Z	thiebaude		ok
2009-08-07T05:06:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	hey I should remember that final e in your nick, it might help
2009-08-07T05:06:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	audio shutters?
2009-08-07T05:07:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	you said laptop?
2009-08-07T05:07:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	yes on the second one, but what do you mean audio shutters...

2009-08-07T05:08:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	im not sure if thats the problem or not in that link i just gave you
2009-08-07T05:08:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	that link doesn't look like good news! :D
2009-08-07T05:09:00.000Z	thiebaude	Orange_v_Blue	yea,  and im not just how to fix your problem
2009-08-07T05:09:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	It doesn't look like quite the right problem, it's not just video
2009-08-07T05:09:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	naw it's okay, I'm just glad you're as stumped as I am! Now I don't feel so bad...
2009-08-07T05:10:00.000Z	Orange_v_Blue	thiebaude	I mean, it'd be preferable if it was fixable, but if nothing else, that's nice
