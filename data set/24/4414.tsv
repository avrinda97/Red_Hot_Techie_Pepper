2008-11-07T06:25:00.000Z	foxwoods		How would I go about installing an older kernel for intrepid ibex with no internet working (on the machine I want to install it on)?
2008-11-07T06:27:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Get the package, put it on a [flash drive, CD, floppy, tape], plug into machine, install with sudo dpkg -i <file>
2008-11-07T06:28:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	You can find the packages on http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/
2008-11-07T06:29:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	You probably won't need the kernel headers.
2008-11-07T06:29:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	I need to compile ndiswrapper and install it
2008-11-07T06:30:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Then you might need it. Out of pure interest, what's your wifi card?
2008-11-07T06:30:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	I see. http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/base/linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic <-- package is here, btw
2008-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	I need an older one
2008-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Oh. Try looking in dapper, then :P
2008-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	I'm a pentium d, am I 386 or 686......686, right?
2008-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Yeah
2008-11-07T06:37:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	should I already have initrd-tools installed?
2008-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Well, since every kernel depends on them, yes, they should be installed.
2008-11-07T06:51:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	running into problem with modutils
2008-11-07T06:51:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	the current kernel uses module-init-tools, whereas I need modutils for a previous kernel
2008-11-07T06:52:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Uh, I don't know. Can't you just install modutils?
2008-11-07T06:52:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	no, they conflict
2008-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	module-init-tools is supposed to replace modutils
2008-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Hm... I assume removing module-init-tools would create major breakage?
2008-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	I tried, it looked like it
2008-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Then I have no idea, sorry :|
2008-11-07T06:53:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	but it shouldn't matter to me If I'm able to install the old kernel
2008-11-07T06:54:00.000Z	foxwoods	apo_	I'm gonna do it and I'll see what happens :)
2008-11-07T06:54:00.000Z	apo_	foxwoods	Good luck
