2005-04-06T12:08:00.000Z	exalted		hi there. after a "hoary (preview) server" installation, to obtain a <<base>> window environment (gnome) what i have to install as packages? (This process is essential, otherwise default Ubuntu installation freezee) Thanks.
2005-04-06T12:09:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	which package?
2005-04-06T12:10:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	i don't remember exactly, puf, maybe that was, "gstream" something like that.
2005-04-06T12:13:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	Seveas: what do you say?
2005-04-06T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	can you give us more information about the package, and what you mean by "freeze"?
2005-04-06T12:17:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	Seveas: The very "default" installation goes well, and installs the base system, then a regular reboot, and begin to update the packages list, and according to do this continue to install rest of the system (from cd or from internet if necessary), when turn comes to "gstream...blah blah" package installation freeze, and nothing happens, an infinite operation on CPU, it gets warm up,...
2005-05-14T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	yes you can.
2005-05-14T08:03:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	how?
2005-05-14T08:04:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	in this way i just loose my version control.
2005-05-14T08:05:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	no
2005-05-14T08:05:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	if you try to remove ubuntu-base it removes gdm with it =)
2005-05-14T08:06:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	many people, for example, allow ubuntu-desktop to uninstall when they want to remove something they don't particularly like
2005-05-14T08:07:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	what about the ubuntu-base?
2005-05-14T08:07:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	what package do you want to remove?
2005-05-14T08:07:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	that's what i'm saying exactly.
2005-05-14T08:08:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	let's see a min.
2005-05-14T08:09:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	vim
2005-05-14T08:11:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	you can remove vim, if you wish.  As thoreauputic, be aware of the warning (by reading the results from "apt-cache show ubuntu-base")
2005-05-14T08:12:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	if i want to remove completely vim, it removes ubuntu-base.
2005-05-14T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	right, which you can do.  Again, read the warning.
2005-05-14T08:13:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	there's a difference between remove a meta-package and removing all of its dependencies.  removing ubuntu-base does _not_ remove all its dependencies
2005-05-14T08:14:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	i know, which is a non-nice think :)
2005-05-14T08:15:00.000Z	tritium	exalted	you can uninstall it again after you upgrade to breezy.
2005-05-14T08:17:00.000Z	exalted	tritium	just as a suggestion, i think ubuntu (and debian also) has to find a better solution to this issue? don't you think?
