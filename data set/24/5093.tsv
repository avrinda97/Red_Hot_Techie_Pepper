2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	aterphasma		why is the battery status icon changing when I unplug and replug my power cable?
2006-10-29T14:25:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	because it detects that you have changed power source
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	aterphasma		sorry, i meant why is it NOT changing
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	aterphasma		i knwo it should be
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	just check tooltip message over icon
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	if it says that AC Power on when cable is plugged, everything is ok
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	honesly I don't know if icon should be changing in Edgy
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	but when i remove it, it still says it's plugged in...
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	that's not good
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	seems like ACPI reporting problems
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	i got that impression
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	acpid is started/running
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	it is definetly a bug, so you propably should report it
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	what kind of laptop, model, vendor?
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	hp compaq nc8430, and it worked fine in beta3
2006-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	and i don't really know how to submit bug reports and such
2006-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	did you dist-upgrade or clean install?
2006-10-29T14:31:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	this time it was clean off the dvd
2006-10-29T14:32:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	hmmmm, beta 3 also was clean install, I presume?
2006-10-29T14:32:00.000Z	aterphasma		yes
2006-10-29T14:34:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	ok, I will check out if bug system doesn't have reported already this one
2006-10-29T14:35:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	thanks
2006-10-29T14:38:00.000Z	pecisk	aterphasma	you could do a "dmesg > dmesg.txt", open dmesg.txt in gedit, copy it, and paste it in www.pastebin.com, and then give me url it will give you
2006-10-29T14:40:00.000Z	aterphasma	pecisk	right
