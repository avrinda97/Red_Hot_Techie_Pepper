2011-04-26T01:14:00.000Z	prakas		hiii. does rc.local execute commands in root mode by default or you need to put a sudo prefix to them?
2011-04-26T01:14:00.000Z	prakas		i am not sure if i should prefix sudo inside rc.local
2011-04-26T01:16:00.000Z	prakas		let me repeat is sudo required when putting commands in rc.local file?
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	prakas		/etc/rc.local
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	escott	prakas	no
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	prakas	escott	it runs in root mode you sure? thats what i needed
2011-04-26T01:17:00.000Z	escott	prakas	who else would it run as, nobody else is logged in
2011-04-26T01:18:00.000Z	prakas	escott	nice ;)
2011-04-26T01:18:00.000Z	prakas	escott	do you know what command should i give to restart networking after i configure an interface in ifconfig
2011-04-26T01:19:00.000Z	prakas	escott	ifconfig eth1 up doesnt seem to work
2011-04-26T01:19:00.000Z	escott	prakas	other than ifconfig up?
2011-04-26T01:20:00.000Z	prakas	escott	i need to go to wireless networking gui and type the gateway address again and subnet then press ok. otherwise i cannot ping. it says no network or something
2011-04-26T01:20:00.000Z	escott	prakas	i'm not sure i spend to much time fighting network manager to get it to stop touching my config. maybe configure dhclient to start on the interface?
2011-04-26T01:21:00.000Z	prakas	escott	i need static address. it is set to use static
2011-04-26T01:21:00.000Z	escott	prakas	route?
2011-04-26T01:21:00.000Z	prakas	escott	it works but after changing the mac address ifconfig eth1 up doesnt seem to work unless i give the gateway again manually in the gui
2011-04-26T01:22:00.000Z	prakas	escott	is there any networking. restart or something. i am new to linux. heard someone say there is something like that
2011-04-26T01:24:00.000Z	escott	prakas	im going to guess you need to mess with route
2011-04-26T01:26:00.000Z	prakas	escott	it is already set through the gui before. let me check resolve.conf then :)
2011-04-26T01:26:00.000Z	escott	prakas	you probably want to disable network manager handling the device
2011-04-26T01:27:00.000Z	prakas	escott	that would be better
2011-04-26T19:30:00.000Z	prakas	escott	do you know any way to bring the vnc server (remote desktop) back in ubuntu? i am unable to connect to the server anymore. i can just ping to the machine running ubuntu
2011-04-26T19:30:00.000Z	escott	prakas	can you ssh in
2011-04-26T19:31:00.000Z	prakas	escott	how? does ubuntu have a ssh server by default?
