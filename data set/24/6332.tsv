2008-07-27T11:56:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	it looks like you tried to install it by hand (not via apt or synaptic), or build it from source
2008-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	what do you need it for?
2008-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	libssh2 is probably the package you need
2008-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	if you're trying to compile a package that's not in the repositories, try to install all of its dependencies via synaptic as much as possible
2008-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	so for instance, if it needs libssh2, then you'd search for that in synaptic, and install any -dev packages you find
2008-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	libssh2-1-dev and libssh-2-dev, in this case
2008-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	one of hydra's dependencies is libssh v0.11
2008-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	.11 exactly, or just that or better?
2008-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	do you know that it won't work with libssh2-1-dev?
2008-07-27T12:04:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	i KNOW that it needs libssh v0.11
2008-07-27T12:10:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	hydra-5.4?
2008-07-27T12:13:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	c
2008-07-27T12:16:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	am i crazy?  am i missing something?
2008-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	one sec
2008-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	oh!  figured it out
2008-07-27T12:17:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	k :)
2008-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	i downloaded libssh-0.2.tgz and it has the right libs to get hydra to work right
2008-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	thanks for the help
2008-07-27T12:18:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	one thing I want to point out is that downloading a binary library that a tool of such provenance is rather sketchy from a security standpoint
2008-07-27T12:19:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	hmmm, you mean as it's outdated and may have security holes or something?
2008-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	no, more that it could include backdoors
2008-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	i see
2008-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	giacomo	cwillu	would it be better not to mess with it?
2008-07-27T12:21:00.000Z	cwillu	giacomo	there are other tools available, but I'd definately try to stick to trustable sources, or else keep that binary contained on a seperate machine
