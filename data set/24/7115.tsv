2005-04-21T15:01:00.000Z	REWind		Have anyone noticed that the Sun Java JRE doesn't work anymore with Hoary 5.04, it worked for a few days ago, but not anymore.. been reinstalling and jabbing around with it now for a while!
2005-04-21T15:01:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	it works fine for me.
2005-04-21T15:02:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	what version do you use?
2005-04-21T15:02:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	1.4.1 from IBM
2005-04-21T15:03:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	even if I tried to figure out how to download the IBM one.. I never find a way, but I learned something, both of the two other java kits for Linux is just copies from Sun anyways.. so why choose them? and why can't the 1.5.0-02 work?
2005-04-21T15:04:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	I use IBM's because it's tuned for my applications.
2005-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	something like that I learned aswell, IBM was talking alot of their java but in conjunction of their products.. but for rest of us there must be a way to get the SUN to work, especially now when it work for a few days ago!!
2005-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	please explain what sort of issues you have.
2005-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	I downloaded the sun for a few the week before last, installed the rpm through alien, went fine and fast! made a symb.link to my home/.moz.. you know... my online banking started to work! Lovely, now for a few days ago my bank online stoped to work, I complained of course, but after the nasty email I noticed that the test on Sun's homepage didn't work aswell. .followed the instructions for troubleshooting the problem with Sun and
2005-04-21T15:16:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	what do you think about the java issue?
2005-05-10T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	lsmod|grep sd_mod
2005-05-10T13:13:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	yes that module is loaded if that is what you mean..
2005-05-10T13:13:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	in dmesg, is there any output regarding "sd" ?
2005-05-10T13:21:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	yes I get some outputs about it, a nice list though so I don't think I can give it to you here on the channel. It gives me the partitions and some other facts.. it worked for a few weeks ago. Stoped as well as my Java to work at a stage...
2005-05-10T13:21:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	paste onto http://pastebin.com
2005-05-10T13:25:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	can you give me a hint what that site is all about, please? looks intressting but don't know how to classify things..
2005-05-10T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	paste your sd-related output from dmesg onto there. It's used for troubleshooting.
2005-05-10T13:28:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	will someone look at that and might change something in future updates is that the way it works? Thanks anyways...
2005-05-10T13:28:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	we use it for large pastes/floods
2005-05-10T13:29:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	do you have an idea why SUNs Java engine stoped work as well here just before release of Horay?
2005-05-10T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	it works fine on my Hoary system (both 1.4.2 and 1.5.0)
2005-05-10T13:33:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	the 1.5 update2 worked as well fine for me, but when it stoped working I installed the 1.4.2 and when I visit a site with java the browser crashes! annoying it is!
2005-05-10T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	REWind	you have to use 1.5 update 3
2005-05-10T13:57:00.000Z	REWind	crimsun	I downloaded the latest Java from SUN and at the same time deleted the installed java on my system. Noticed that update 2 is the latest availiable on Sun's homepage. It still doesn't work...
