2007-10-04T16:18:00.000Z	flush		just letting you know
2007-10-04T16:18:00.000Z	flush		the "wodim" app is amazing
2007-10-04T16:19:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	yeah, it exposes the apt underworld very nicely, doesn't it
2007-10-04T16:19:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	this is national security
2007-12-08T01:19:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	you'd need to sudo chown , since it's owned by root
2007-12-08T01:20:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	no, i mean i want it to be owned by 1000 1000
2007-12-08T01:22:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	then you would use uid=1000,gid=1000
2007-12-08T01:22:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	but you'll be bumping up against the udev/hald automounting stuff, probably have to mount/unmount manually
2007-12-08T01:25:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	this is a usb external?
2007-12-08T01:25:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	try moving the mountpoint out of media, that is a special directory
2007-12-08T01:25:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	how will it know hwere to mount it then ?
2007-12-08T01:26:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	I use /vista and /win-d as my extra directories ...
2007-12-08T01:26:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	erm, mountpoints, to be specific
2007-12-08T01:27:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	you'll need to create the mount point directories first, sudo mkdir /<mountpointname> , then replace /media/horizon with the /<mountpointname>
2007-12-08T01:28:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	move it out of media :)
2007-12-08T01:29:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	special directory, handled automatically by the automounter. Had that issue myself
2007-12-08T01:31:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	doesnt work in /media/ nor /mnt.
2007-12-08T01:33:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	UUID=DC42-3F5B /vfat vfat defaults,utf8,umask=007,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 1 works here
2007-12-08T01:36:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	heres the line
2007-12-08T01:37:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	and you did sudo mkdir /horizon ?
2007-12-08T01:37:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	 sudo umount /horizon && sudo mount /horizon
2007-12-08T01:38:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	same thing
2007-12-08T01:39:00.000Z	nickrud	flush	not sure, that line looks just fine to me.
2007-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	flush	nickrud	hell to me too man
