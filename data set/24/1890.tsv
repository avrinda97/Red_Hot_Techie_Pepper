2009-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	Andorin		Hey! I have a serious Karmic issue! When my display goes to sleep, nothing whatsoever that I do will bring it back up! Why is this happening?
2009-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	do you havee ati graphics and do you have compiz enabled?
2009-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	To the best of my knowledge, yes to both questions.
2009-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	disable the desktop effects (compiz) and see if still occurs
2009-11-05T09:13:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	in System>Appearance>Visual effects..
2009-11-05T09:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	set to none'
2009-11-05T09:14:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	I know. I just don't have a way to put to sleep on command.
2009-11-05T09:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	system>shut down>suspend
2009-11-05T09:17:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	that work?
2009-11-05T09:17:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	Nope. It's like the computer totally ignores the fact that I have a keyboard and mouse hooked up.
2009-11-05T09:18:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	to wake frpom sleep hit the power button...
2009-11-05T09:19:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	I did. It had the same problem, though, with merely the display being asleep; I'm supposed to be able to wake the computer up with the keyboard or mouse, but it's not working for me.
2009-11-05T09:20:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	what ati drivers you using and where did u get them?
2009-11-05T09:20:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	I'm... using Karmic's defaults. If that doesn't answer your question, what do I need to do to give you the rest of the answer?
2009-11-05T09:21:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	look in System>administration>hardware drivers and see if you have ATI that you can activate
2009-11-05T09:22:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	Nothing.
2009-11-05T09:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	do this in a terminal... lshw -C video    the C is capital, and tell me what the manufacturer is
2009-11-05T09:25:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	Damn, I'm not using ATI after all. This computer uses Intel, it seems.
2009-11-05T09:27:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	for now, i'd disable the display sleep, but i'd look through the bugs ans on the forums and if you find nothing then file a bug report,,, if you need help to disable the display sleep, let me know
2009-11-05T09:31:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	Nah, one of the first things I did when I noticed this problem was display the sleep. Thanks for your help, though.
2009-11-05T09:36:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	have you tried hitting "esc" while display sleep?
2009-11-05T09:36:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	Yes.
2009-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	SeaPhor	Andorin	not to push,,, but i work at HP on the Linux team and we constantly test these types of power management issues constantly... surprisingly intel graphics has the least issues,,, ati the most, and add compiz and more issues,,, i would be interested in seeing more if you get the info
2009-11-05T09:41:00.000Z	Andorin	SeaPhor	It's no problem. If I learn anything else, I'll try to pass it on to you.
