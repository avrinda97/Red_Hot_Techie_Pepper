2011-03-25T01:19:00.000Z	lordmofisto		Darik's Boot and Nuke
2011-03-25T01:21:00.000Z	lordmofisto		I don't want to sound nosey but why would you want full disk encryption?
2011-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	lordmofisto		is there a terminal command to get in to the MBR?
2011-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	What do you want to get?
2011-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	dban isn't working and I want to completely erase my hard drive before installing ubuntu to it
2011-03-25T01:24:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	Well, you can zero it out...  That what you want
2011-03-25T01:25:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	If you just want to zero it out, just do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512
2011-03-25T01:26:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	where sda is the hard drive in question.
2011-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	That souds like just a problem with grub.  Can probably be fixed.
2011-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	how do I fix that?
2011-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	What version of Ubuntu did you install?
2011-03-25T01:29:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	10.10
2011-03-25T01:29:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	Are there options in the grub menu when is about to boot?
2011-03-25T01:30:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	Maybe it's just set to the wrong kernel as default.
2011-03-25T01:30:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	not sure really this is my first Ubuntu install, and first desktop install. I have used Pardus via VirtualBox which installed fine
2011-03-25T01:31:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	Did you do a normal install or wubi
2011-03-25T01:31:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	normal install
2011-03-25T01:32:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	I selected for the install to use the entire partition and erase all the data
2011-03-25T01:32:00.000Z	terry_	lordmofisto	See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
2011-03-25T01:33:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	ok, let me look
2011-03-25T01:34:00.000Z	lordmofisto	terry_	Ok I am lost, where exactly do I do this? Its not part of the installation
