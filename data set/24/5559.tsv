2007-01-07T17:35:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	what version of the gimp can edit pdfs??
2007-01-07T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	all I've tried since dapper
2007-01-07T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	it just opens it as an image that you can add stuff too, it doesn't extract text into text layers for example
2007-01-07T17:37:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	in other words it does not edit pdfs, it converts them to images...
2007-01-07T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	well you could edit it :)  But yes, importing would be more correct
2007-01-07T17:41:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	i am not trying to be a pita - words are sometimes very loosely used here and it will almost always cause issues...
2007-01-07T17:42:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	seems to me that 'how can i edit hippos?' means changing the file within the framework of the structure of the file.
2007-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	that changed in 6.10 ?
2007-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	not that I know of
2007-01-07T13:21:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	/var/www has been the default apache doc root and www-data has been the default user for a long time
2007-01-12T09:05:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	read all of Skyheath's messages...I think you will find we extended ourselve properly?
2007-01-12T09:06:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	yeah your're right, I just popped in and saw the last one
2007-01-12T09:06:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	:)
2007-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	doesn't vim as installed = vim lite w/o syntax highlighting?
2007-01-14T15:17:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	vim.basic gives me syntax highlighting
2007-01-15T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	umask=0222
2007-01-15T06:33:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	- we are like 3 hours into this :)
2007-01-15T07:16:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	will that work if he ison the live cd instead of real install?
2007-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	sure, why not?
2007-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	just askin
2007-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	it should
2007-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	the line is in his fstab yes
2007-02-09T07:55:00.000Z	mnoir	jrib	- you  figure the kernel pkg update glitch should make it into the channel header?
2007-02-09T07:56:00.000Z	jrib	mnoir	yeah, that would be nice
