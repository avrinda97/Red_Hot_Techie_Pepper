2006-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		it worked :)
2006-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		ok I got the folder in my cd called "lnx". I need to transfer its content to $home/windows_drivers
2006-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		cp /media/cdrom/lnx* $home/windows_drivers ?
2006-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		what would be the correct command
2006-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		no
2006-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		ok thanks :)
2006-01-19T08:51:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		I guess you all think "why does this fool fool around with the server version when he doesn't now shit what hes doing" the answer is simple: the pc is too slow for gnome and kde, thus I need to install the xubuntu gui on the server version
2006-01-19T08:52:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		is that the proper name for the xubuntu thing?
2006-01-19T08:53:00.000Z	huhn_2punkt0		yeah that's what i meant
2006-01-19T08:53:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	well first I was not thinking about that, second if you have a specific question feel free to ask it:: >> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop<< is the command
2006-01-19T08:53:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	there was a day when I did not know anything about computers, and as time goes by I feel I know less :-)
2006-01-19T08:54:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	is it a desktop?
2006-01-19T08:55:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	okay to make life easy for all concerned any chance you can use "wire" and make a physical connection to the outside world from that box
2006-01-19T09:02:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	>> grep eth0 /etc/network/interfaces << does that give a reply?
2006-01-19T09:03:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	what kind of a laptop brand and model number is that?
2006-01-19T09:11:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	if something is not on the Cd burn it to another CD and put that in the box
2006-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	well the windows packages for it - google the other stuff as HappyFool said
2006-01-19T09:29:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	put as much info as possible in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org then tell us the url and someone may have useful info for you
2006-01-19T09:38:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	have you gotten your wifi to work?
2006-01-19T10:53:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	you usually do not need to build anything on ubuntu :) 17500 packages
2006-06-06T13:56:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	I have a 200 gig system with over 50 in use - for the minimum to get a useful box you want 10G
2006-06-06T13:58:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	your wasting so much space
2006-06-06T13:58:00.000Z	ompaul	huhn_2punkt0	I live without windows for years and I am happy
