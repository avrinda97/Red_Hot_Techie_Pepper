2005-07-21T16:29:00.000Z	marsh		if they are constantly reminded of where the conf files are, then they'll start to investigate.
2005-07-21T16:30:00.000Z	marsh		auto.... no...
2005-07-21T16:30:00.000Z	marsh		I'm not dissing the gui thing.
2005-07-21T16:30:00.000Z	marsh		I think it is an amazing environtment
2005-07-21T16:31:00.000Z	marsh		but do you aggree that is it often quicker, faster and less rsi if you can talk to your system rather than just select menu options?
2005-07-21T16:33:00.000Z	marsh		there appears to me to be (and the ubuntu environment is the one I choose to be in because they are further above it than others I have tried)
2005-07-21T16:34:00.000Z	marsh		yeah, anto9us my ramble is that i think that there is a class division between newbee & experienced user
2005-07-21T16:35:00.000Z	marsh		( that was the 'not so much ubuntu' thing
2005-07-21T16:36:00.000Z	marsh		theres a massive class division and coder do seem to hold a contempt-ish kindda attitude towards n00bs & force them out into the big void of google for endless reading to find the answers to questioned...
2005-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	marsh		but if the config file names are 'advertised' in menu's & things...
2005-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	holycow	marsh	not really, there actually happens to be a 'right way' and a 'wrong way' to do things
2005-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	holycow		coders expect the user to come ready with being prepared to 'do it the right way'
2005-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	marsh	holycow	- explain..?
2005-07-21T16:38:00.000Z	holycow	marsh	well first, noobs are a very arrogant presumptous bunch overall
2005-07-21T16:38:00.000Z	holycow		especially the windows users
2005-07-21T16:38:00.000Z	holycow		almost all of them come with a whole pile of baggage
2005-07-21T16:39:00.000Z	holycow		which is usually labeled 'the customer is right, therefore even if i am completelly wrong i will stillinsist that i am right"
2005-07-21T16:39:00.000Z	marsh	holycow	- but do you have a sympathy for them?
2005-07-21T16:39:00.000Z	holycow		the second problem is the willingness of the user to actually learn
2005-07-21T16:39:00.000Z	holycow		yes of course
2005-07-21T16:39:00.000Z	holycow		i take copious amounts of time to help them overcome their baggage
2005-07-21T16:40:00.000Z	holycow	marsh	perhaps you are talking about arrogance?>
2005-07-21T16:40:00.000Z	marsh		do you think they would be happier, more comfortable
2005-07-21T16:40:00.000Z	marsh	holycow	from the coders..?
