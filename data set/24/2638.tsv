2008-10-12T02:51:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I have a problem installing Linux 8.04, whenever I pick the language, my screen goes blank and the osd says "No support"
2008-10-12T02:52:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		is there any way to force it into text-mode ?
2008-10-12T02:52:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	yOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY THE ALTERNATE IMAGE
2008-10-12T02:52:00.000Z	merkoth		sorry about the caps
2008-10-12T02:53:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	merkoth	hehe, n/p. but there is no other way but using the alternate cd ?
2008-10-12T02:53:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	to make a text-only install, no
2008-10-12T02:54:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		hrm, okay
2008-10-12T02:54:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	anyway, your problem is kinda weird
2008-10-12T02:54:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	merkoth	I know. I have a strange panel
2008-10-12T02:54:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	a strange panel? are you installing from the livecd?
2008-10-12T02:55:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	have you tried choosing "install ubuntu" from the livecd boot?
2008-10-12T02:55:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	that way you don't load the whole desktop
2008-10-12T02:56:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	merkoth	I burned the "normal" cd
2008-10-12T02:56:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		so I guess that's the livecd
2008-10-12T02:56:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		ive tried the "install ubuntu" option but at some point, the screen goes blank
2008-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	right. but when you boot that cd you can choose to "install" or "run without modifications"
2008-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		so it might be some res and/or refreshrate thats not supported
2008-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	if you choose to run you can install later by using the icon on the desktop
2008-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	merkoth	ah, right
2008-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I'll try that, brb
2008-10-12T02:58:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	But maybe you could try using the other method, which doesn't load the whole desktop
2008-10-12T02:58:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	you could also check the cd for defects
2008-10-12T02:58:00.000Z	merkoth	Iceman_B^Ltop	you really shouldn't have to use the alternate :/
