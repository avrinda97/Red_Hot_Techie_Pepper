2011-08-11T07:46:00.000Z	evan_		hey everyone. I just downloaded an update from update manager this morning for adobe flash 64 plugin, and now I am having problems with flash player.
2011-08-11T07:48:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	yeah im having the same problem
2011-08-11T07:47:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	 are you in 64bit ubuntu?
2011-08-11T07:47:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	 yes
2011-08-11T07:48:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	ah :D
2011-08-11T07:56:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	i got it to work but not from update-manager
2011-08-11T07:57:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	yea me too. I had to downgrade to the last stable version
2011-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	have you tried the incubator build?
2011-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	im using the beta i think
2011-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	I don't think so. my version # is 10.3.183.5
2011-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	im using 11.+
2011-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	and the 64bit works? I just tried installed the upgrade to 10.4.1 and it stopped playing certain things
2011-08-11T08:02:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	its odd that it is in 32 bit lib directory
2011-08-11T08:02:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	maybe thats why the flash-aid isnt working
2011-08-11T08:03:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	I got flash working but its just at a lower version
2011-08-11T08:04:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	flashaid fixed it. I just had to downgrade from the update I installed this morning
2011-08-11T08:05:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	no I have 10.3.183.5. I will try uninstall this version and installing 11 and than use the flashaid
2011-08-11T08:07:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	yea I uninstalled version 10 and then installed version 11 and ran flashaid but does not play
2011-08-11T08:09:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	how did you install version 11? did you change permission?
2011-08-11T08:09:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	I installed it through package manager
2011-08-11T08:09:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	you want an ubuntu pure flashplayer?
2011-08-11T08:10:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	its fine actually. I am able to play everything good with no problems with 10.3
2011-08-11T08:10:00.000Z	linuxuz3r	evan_	ok
2011-08-11T08:11:00.000Z	evan_	linuxuz3r	thanks for the help though. I got it working again so its all good :D
