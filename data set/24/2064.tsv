2009-04-27T09:45:00.000Z	Guest62638		hey, I have a usb device, but I'm unable to connect to it, how do I check to see if its working probperly
2009-04-27T09:45:00.000Z	Guest62638		Its listed when I do "lsusb"
2009-04-27T09:46:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	any chance you get a nick? :) What does lsusb say about your device?
2009-04-27T09:47:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	okay, so you have a calculator that can connect to usb. and what do you do with it when it is connected to usb?
2009-04-27T09:48:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	I got a program TiLP that's supposed to be able to use it...furthermore, VirtualBox is not detecting so I may attach it to a guest machien
2009-04-27T09:49:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	ahah! There is special software that talks to the calculator! And.... you tried to run that software in an XP session in Vbox? But you installed the OEM Vbox from the repos, not the PUEL Vbox from Sun. So you cannot access USB from Vbox. Evar!
2009-04-27T09:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	bing bing bing thats it bing bing bing
2009-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	but first you need to uninstall what you already installed. Don't worry, your vdi doesn't need to be rebuilt.
2009-04-27T09:51:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	don't I need to exporet the machines I have already?
2009-04-27T09:52:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	Well, copy the .vdi out of the .virtualbox directory to be safe.
2009-04-27T09:52:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	where are they located? /home?
2009-04-27T09:53:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	/home/user/.virtualbox/somewhereinthere
2009-04-27T09:56:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	Did it ever occur to you that the hour or three you spend making this work so you can load your calculator with finals answers, you could have just learned the material?
2009-04-27T09:56:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	did you uninstall the old vbox?
2009-04-27T09:56:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	its formulae you need for the tests?
2009-04-27T10:00:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	anyways, you have to uninstall the version from the repos before you can install the version from SunOracle.
2009-04-27T10:01:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	I did that and its still not working, I tried downloading and installing the i386 version as well and still didn't work
2009-04-27T10:01:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	what OS are you installing on?
2009-04-27T10:03:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	Kubuntu. Which version? Jaunty? Intrepid? Hardy?
2009-04-27T10:04:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	latest (the one that came out few days ago) jaunty? (i guess)
2009-04-27T10:04:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	Scroll down to where it says to add this to your sources.list file
2009-04-27T10:05:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	Add the line to sources.list and then follow the remaining instructions. Do not install the .deb but instead install from apt-get. Follow those instructions
2009-04-27T10:06:00.000Z	Guest62638	AK_Dave	what instructions are you referring to?
2009-04-27T10:06:00.000Z	AK_Dave	Guest62638	The ones on this page, halfway down http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
