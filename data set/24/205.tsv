2012-03-13T08:16:00.000Z	samster34		hi...I've been trying to install ubuntu but install or running it from a live cd both freeze :/
2012-03-13T08:18:00.000Z	samster34		yes. this occurs shortly after it says something about detecting the video card, possibly while detecting the network chip
2012-03-13T08:18:00.000Z	samster34		yes, in fact I#ve tried several older versions and other distros as well
2012-03-13T08:19:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	as you are booting up press shift for the grub menu, press e add nomodeset to kernal line
2012-03-13T08:20:00.000Z	samster34	waxstone	I pressed tab on the cd's screen for running or installing linux, and added that option there...same thing or not?
2012-03-13T08:21:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	yes thats the same
2012-03-13T08:22:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	delete everything after /casper/initrd.lz and add quiet splash nomodeset
2012-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	hmm sorry thats all ive got...
2012-03-13T08:36:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	can you put an enxample of what you are seeing into pastebin?
2012-03-13T08:40:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	have you checked the cd for errors?
2012-03-13T08:57:00.000Z	samster34	waxstone	I redid the flash drive with the tool suggestedon the page you linked, and it works even less than before
2012-03-13T08:58:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	 what is the last thing it says before dying now?
2012-03-13T08:59:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	there are a few known issues with USB installation the only help links I know are here. there are two links
2012-03-13T09:01:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	still without success though.
2012-03-13T09:02:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	sell the live cd to your neighbour after ;P
2012-03-13T09:11:00.000Z	samster34	waxstone	while without success, I tested them and the flash drives prepared with universal usb installer boot fine on my other copmputer
2012-03-13T09:13:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	I dont doubt that. Something different on this box is preventing the install. Hardware,BIOS, who knows,keep posting your problem a USB install  master will show up and help you
2012-03-13T09:14:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	try another brand of usb if possible
2012-03-13T09:33:00.000Z	samster34	waxstone	okay, tinkerig with a mint live cd's shell that I got running, it seems to be a problem with the xorg config
2012-03-13T10:16:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	what version of ubuntu have you burnt to dvd?
2012-03-13T11:02:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	is it windows 8 beta?
2012-03-13T11:06:00.000Z	waxstone	samster34	 for text mode press E in grub menu when you highlight recoverymode. then replace recovery with text in kernal line
