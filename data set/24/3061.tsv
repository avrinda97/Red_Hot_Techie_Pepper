2008-05-07T06:54:00.000Z	kuahara		Is there ANY way to locate 125GB of missing unallocated space???????????
2008-05-07T06:55:00.000Z	kuahara		this os is so freakin weak
2008-05-07T06:56:00.000Z	kuahara		thats what I'm trying to figure out is if there is a way to repair a damaged partition table
2008-05-07T06:57:00.000Z	kuahara		I swear partition magic fucked it all up
2008-05-07T06:57:00.000Z	kuahara		is that 125GB lost forever?
2008-05-07T06:57:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	try Parted Magic.. it is gparted version of Partition magic.. and since its linux.. its better than partition magic
2008-05-07T06:58:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	Make another boot CD or boot USB using Parted Magic.. its done wonders for me.. it'll even mount partitions to retrieve data from it..
2008-05-07T06:59:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	but how do I burn the files to CD with that boot disk
2008-05-07T06:59:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	can you run the Ubuntu LiveCD?!!!
2008-05-07T06:59:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	yes
2008-05-07T07:00:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	go online.. http://partedmagic.com/wiki/PartedMagic.php  and create either a boot CD or a boot USB drive.. you should be able to do that within the LiveCD
2008-05-07T07:06:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	Try Parted Magic.. if the missing partition ended up being just a hidden partition.. Parted Magic can mount it and you can copy it to either a USB drive or another partition.
2008-05-07T07:20:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	can parted magic be used as a boot image?
2008-05-07T07:21:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	It is meant to be used as a boot image.. an it'll load itself onto the memory so that you can eject the CD after you boot it up..
2008-05-07T07:21:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	liveCD or parted magic?
2008-05-07T07:23:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	LiveCD means a fully operational Operating System running from a CD without writing anything to the hard drive, and using the CD as its resource to read files from. Parted Magic is just like that, except that if you have enough memory in your PC it'll load the whole CD into memory, so you can use the CD-Drive for other purposes.
2008-05-07T07:27:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	thx I'll try that
2008-05-07T07:36:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	top.. and sorry its not VCORE.. just Core..
2008-05-07T07:52:00.000Z	kuahara	djhash	still around?
2008-05-07T08:52:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	seems like the problem is worse than I thought.. sorry was away for a while.. but i'm glad to see you've recovered your files.. or atleast see them.. :-)
2008-05-07T11:40:00.000Z	djhash	kuahara	'su' will log you on as a super user.. basically root
