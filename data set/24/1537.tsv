2010-02-01T19:49:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	secureCRT but i can setup putty in a sec here
2010-02-01T19:40:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	I understand -- but is it Ubuntu Server or is it Ubuntu Desktop you're sshed in?
2010-02-01T19:41:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	it is a poweredge srvr hardware , but i am running desktop
2010-02-01T19:42:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	I'll keep this short and sweet. Log out SSH -- "ssh -Y host@ip" -- Then you run "firefox &"   Firefox will appear in front of you (from your home machine).
2010-02-01T19:45:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	pm
2010-02-01T19:46:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	Talk here.
2010-02-01T19:47:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	ok how do i log out of ssh and the "ssh -y"
2010-02-01T19:48:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	You're using Putty for ssh?
2010-02-01T19:49:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	You're looking for *any* option to enable on X11 forwarding. Also, wouldn't it be easier if you download it yourself and send an email to yourself for later?
2010-02-01T19:50:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	i need it now actually
2010-02-01T19:52:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	secureCRT does support X11 forwarding after all.
2010-02-01T19:52:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	in putty, in X11 section, what will be the X display location ?
2010-02-01T19:52:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	0
2010-02-01T19:53:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	McL0VIN	Maybe localhost:0  -- Either way.
2010-02-01T19:54:00.000Z	McL0VIN	kinja-sheep	i got  Error: cannot open display: localhost:11.0
