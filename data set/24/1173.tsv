2010-05-30T03:39:00.000Z	mbrproblem10		hi ostap
2010-05-30T03:41:00.000Z	mbrproblem10		Can anyone tell me if its possible to reload a mbr from a backup mbr.bin file?
2010-05-30T03:41:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	that depends
2010-05-30T03:42:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	on what?
2010-05-30T03:42:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	if I'm not mistaking, the first partitions (not extended) are in the MBR
2010-05-30T03:44:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	so as an example, if you have 2 drives, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, and you copy the first 512 bytes from sda to sdb, your mbr is repaired
2010-05-30T03:45:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	what exactly is the problem with your MBR?
2010-05-30T03:48:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	I originally used qparted (off of the ubuntu live usb or is it gparted) to move a windows 7 partition. This failed. I attempted to use Testdisk to locate it. However, that failed, and lost my Lucid partition. All i really want now is my lucid partition back. I made two backups of the mbr. One using the command line which produced this mbr.bin file and also a backup using Testdisk. However, the testdisk will not load the backup.
2010-05-30T03:49:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	You can first make a backup, if /dev/sda is your drive : dd if=/dev/sda of=backup.bin bs=512 count=1, then copy the saved file dd if=mbr.bin of=/dev/sda
2010-05-30T03:50:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	my mbr is toast. im trying to reload the backup that is good.
2010-05-30T03:51:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	can i do that from the Ubuntu live usb or the ubuntu rescue remix usb?
2010-05-30T03:52:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	you'll also want to load the backup file on a flash drive or so, of course
2010-05-30T03:52:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	 here is what i do not understand.
2010-05-30T03:53:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	if my 10.04 partition is lost. IE i cant find it nor can the Ubuntu live usb, where am i supposed to copy my mbr.bin to?
2010-05-30T03:54:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	I understand you can see the drive /dev/sda or so, but the partition table is hosed?
2010-05-30T03:54:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	where is your backup of the mbr stored?
2010-05-30T03:55:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	in a couple places, i have a laptop that its on, and on two different usb keys.
2010-05-30T03:55:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	When i boot into Ubuntu live, it does see the 10.04 partition. The odd thing is it sees 9.04 partition, but not my 10.04 partition.
2010-05-30T03:55:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	ok, so start the live cd, mount the flash drive, then do sudo dd if=[path to backup] of=/dev/sda , provided that's what your drive is
2010-05-30T03:56:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	starting live usb ubuntu
2010-05-30T04:09:00.000Z	mbrproblem10	henkpostma	 ?
2010-05-30T04:13:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	if that's the path to your backup, then yes, that's the right command
2010-05-30T04:13:00.000Z	henkpostma	mbrproblem10	if it's not, dd will complain presumably
