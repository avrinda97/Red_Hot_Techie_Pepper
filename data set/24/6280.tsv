2006-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	jon_		i want to install it
2006-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	jon_		thats all i really know, the help guide is trying to confuse me
2006-08-05T12:36:00.000Z	jon_		basically it wants me to make the bin file i downloaded executable
2006-08-05T12:36:00.000Z	jon_		thats what im stuck on
2006-08-05T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	chmod +x filename
2006-08-05T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	yes,   filename is the name of the file you downloaded.   chmod -x says "make executable"
2006-08-05T12:58:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	depends.  some are groups of programs, but a package can be a set of files for a single program.
2006-08-05T12:59:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	what do you mean by "not recognize"?
2006-08-05T13:00:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	what do you mean by "it won't let me"?  instead of misinterpreting what is happening, tell us what you type and what happens.
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	because the file is not in your home directory, it is in $HOME/Desktop
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	you do have no such file.  because it isn't in the directory where your command line starts.
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	so do this:   cd Desktop
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	then do     ls     which lists files.  you should see the file
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	not desktop, Desktop.   you have to type the correct things.
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	to save typing, you could have done this:    cd De<tab>
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	the tab key will complete the word for you, in this case Desktop
2006-08-05T13:06:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	it will give you a new prompt on a new line.  you can check that it worked by doing this:   ls -l
2006-08-05T13:07:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	that will list all files in the directory, in long format.  the x in the beginning of the line means executable
2006-08-05T13:07:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	you don't need sudo to chmod that file
2006-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	you have to install libstdc++ version 5 to use that binary
2006-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	if you let the package system install it for you, it takes care of such problems.
2006-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	synaptic
2006-08-05T13:09:00.000Z	sethk	jon_	sudo synaptic, actually.  when it asks you for your password, type your password
