2010-01-21T07:02:00.000Z	dark		Hello? The radeon igp 340M just don't work with the default configuration/autodetection of ubuntu 9.10, forcing a downgrade to ubuntu 9.04. why sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg simply does nothing in karmic, and what is the workaround?
2010-01-21T07:03:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	did you check to see if any proprietary drivers were available?
2010-01-21T07:03:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	well, actually the problem is with a friend of mine. but X actually didn't started
2010-01-21T07:04:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	he just installed 9.04 again. I think it should start with vesa or vga driver, at least...
2010-01-21T07:04:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	is X still not running properly, or does it run on 9.04?
2010-01-21T07:04:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	it runs on 9.04. graphical interface doesn't run on 9.10
2010-01-21T07:04:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	most likely if X isn't running its because something got botched in the config
2010-01-21T07:05:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	on 9.04 are there proprietary drivers selected by default for the card?
2010-01-21T07:05:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	how can someone select the driver in 9.10? one must manually edit xorg.conf?
2010-01-21T07:06:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	I'm not too familiar with 9.10's interface, as I use 9.04 Desktop edition on multiple systems.
2010-01-21T07:07:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	I don't know. I can't ask him because he already downgraded to 9.04. But for my nvidia, it selects an open source driver and then ask for installing the proprietary driver, in 9.10. I think with ati it should do the same too
2010-01-21T07:07:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	you might consider posting to the ubuntuforums.org support forums regarding this, because it could actually be a bug, but one thought (cont'd next post)
2010-01-21T07:08:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	if the issue is with ATI cards not working in 9.10, its a bug and should be reported, but if the issue is with X and not the ATI drivers, then the install may have been botched
2010-01-21T07:10:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	I am asking him some more info. maybe he should post this on the forum for his language. (He was asking in #ubuntu-br, but nobody could help, so I came here -- maybe this was a known issue..)
2010-01-21T07:10:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	one moment please, I'm scanning the ubuntuforums.org site to see if this issue was addressed by others
2010-01-21T07:13:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	<dark> one more info: he made an fresh installation with the 9.10 livecd. in the livecd, the X worked. in the installation in the hd, it didn't
2010-01-21T07:13:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	one minute, please, as I'm looking through posts right now
2010-01-21T07:14:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	I haven't found anything relating to this on the forums, so this is quite possibly a bug in 9.10
2010-01-21T07:14:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	have your friend consider making a bug report on this
2010-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	has your friend tried another livecd install to see if that rectifies the issue?
2010-01-21T07:16:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	as in, has your friend tried installing from another livecd?
2010-01-21T07:24:00.000Z	TrekCaptainUSA	dark	you still searching for more information?
2010-01-21T07:25:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	no, I think that with Xorg -configure he will manage to make it work. (He was testing a bunch of distros, all of them worked fine; he liked ubuntu but is stuck with 9.04, but I think he will manage to fix this)
2010-01-21T07:26:00.000Z	dark	TrekCaptainUSA	but I still believe this is a kind of bug
