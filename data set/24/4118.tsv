2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 after following the link that was given to me I came across this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28920/plain/. What should I do?
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	you don't need ntfs to get ipod ipod is fat
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 so type no?
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	if you don't have any NTFS then yes
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 i'm new to this. What does that even mean?
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	NFTS is the default windows filesystem
2007-07-07T08:46:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28921/plain/   The link given said no entires in your /etc/fstab for windows drives already and the window drives are cureently not mounted
2007-07-07T08:47:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	that makes sense if you have no windows drives
2007-07-07T08:48:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 but something is in the /etc/fstab. and it isn't supposed to be...?
2007-07-07T08:49:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	sde? how many drives you have on that machine?
2007-07-07T08:49:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 No clue. but /dev/sde2 is my ipod
2007-07-07T08:51:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	ok that's a start did the script ran ok? try upluging ipod and try again.

2007-07-07T08:52:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	unplug replug
2007-07-07T08:52:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 unplug and replug, then mount? or leave unmounted while doing scripts?
2007-07-07T08:54:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	yes you don't need to have it plug while rehashing the hal list.
2007-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	capitanyochua	elpargo	 Wait? Yes to mounting?
2007-07-07T08:56:00.000Z	elpargo	capitanyochua	dude I am not there I can't give you each and every step, instructions there should make it work just try it out.
