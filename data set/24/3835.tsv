2008-08-25T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	then why would you ask to remove it.
2008-08-25T20:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	sounds like there is no problem.
2008-08-25T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	dont use the enter key as punctuation
2008-08-25T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	dont compile; use what is in repos
2008-08-25T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	what bug; please give link
2008-08-25T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	this is why you never compile; especially when you dont know what you are doing. newer is not better
2008-08-25T21:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	yes
2008-08-25T21:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	that is what caused you problems; you should asked for help with the repos hylafax before doing that.
2008-08-25T21:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	you removed it, correct?
2008-08-25T21:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	why did you delete those directories?
2008-08-25T21:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	that is never the way to remove apps.
2008-08-25T21:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	how are you installing items? with a gui or a cli
2008-08-25T21:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	synaptic? then look for hylafax
2008-08-25T21:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Guest45910	is it installed?
