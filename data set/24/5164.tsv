2007-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	niekie		Hmm... is it ok for "uptime" to give the wrong usercount?
2007-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	niekie		Was wondering why it did that, though.
2007-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	the user count gets bigger by the terminal consoles you have open
2007-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	I see.
2007-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	type: users
2007-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	shows "niekie"
2007-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	niekie		Only 1 :)
2007-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	ok now try the uptime
2007-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	3 users.
2007-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	savvas		:o
2007-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	do you update frequently ?
2007-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	yes.
2007-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	do you have any protection against rootkits?
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	chkrootkit
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	use this one too: http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html
2007-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	can I do sudo apt-get install rkhunter?
2007-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	meh, I'll just compile it.
2007-01-20T16:39:00.000Z	niekie		Though I personally doubt anything being rooted.
2007-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	running check.
2007-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	nope, i don't think so
2007-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	savvas		ok
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	niekie	savvas	mind me pasting something to you in PM?
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	everything should be ok and clean
2007-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	savvas	niekie	go ahead :)
