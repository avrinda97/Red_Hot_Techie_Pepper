2005-10-24T09:25:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	yes it will, or better yet a usb memory stick. if you can connect with windows but not linux then it is definatly your end. i would expect that you will get little to *no* help from your ISP if you mention that you are using linux
2005-10-24T09:28:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	goto packages.debian.org and search for wvdial, if its bigger than 1.44MB use "split" command (man split if your unsure) to put it onto more than one floppy. or better yet get a USB mem stick

2005-10-24T09:43:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	tell you what...
2005-10-24T09:43:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	your probably just going to run into a whole heap of dependancy problems when you d/l it anyway because its not in the main ubuntu tree
2005-10-24T09:44:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	can you network your win98 machine with you linux machine to share the internet?
2005-10-24T09:44:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	ppl say get the ubuntu version. im a gentoo user so they are probably right
2005-10-24T09:45:00.000Z	Odyssey	codemech	... so this porlly means i'm already using it :\
2005-10-24T09:46:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	try typing apt-get install wvdial and see what happens ;)
2005-10-24T09:46:00.000Z	Odyssey	codemech	where? *laffs*
2005-10-24T09:47:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	if you are using gnome press ctrl + F2 and then type gnome-terminal
2005-10-24T09:47:00.000Z	codemech	Odyssey	then type "sudo apt-get install wvdial"
