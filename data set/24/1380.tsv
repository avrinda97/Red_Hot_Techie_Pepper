2010-08-10T19:02:00.000Z	Linux		hy guys...what is that?
2010-08-10T19:02:00.000Z	Linux		The following packages have been kept back:
2010-08-10T19:02:00.000Z	Linux		  libavdevice52 libavformat52
2010-08-10T19:02:00.000Z	Linux		0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
2010-08-10T19:03:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as "kept-back".
2010-08-10T19:05:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	in conclusion y must install 2 packages libavdevice52 libavformat52 ???
2010-08-10T19:05:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	I dont know the package deps for those particular packages, but aptitude resolves them for you.
2010-08-10T19:07:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	what do you want to do?
2010-08-10T19:08:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	you dont need to, jsut to the install, it will do it for you, but it tells you it kept-back packages in order to perform the upgrade.
2010-08-10T19:09:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	do the install, then if you want to check afterwards, do suod apt-get update, then upgrade again.
2010-08-10T19:12:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	how the hell do the install id the update manager dont let mee tick this 2 packages?
2010-08-10T19:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	I told you already:If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as "kept-back".
2010-08-10T19:14:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	ok than how to do this 2 packeges not appear in update manager?
2010-08-10T19:20:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	you dont tell me, how or what can i doo to this 2 packages dont appear in update manager, i dont whant to show up
2010-08-10T19:21:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	?? dont understand.
2010-08-10T19:23:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	i dont what this 2 packages show up in my update manager
2010-08-10T19:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	then you need to remove the applications that are Dependant upon them.
2010-08-10T19:25:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	 now you understand, they needed to perform the upgrade your requesting, so you can't remove them.
2010-08-10T19:29:00.000Z	Linux	KE1HA	i do in terminal sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade and they giv me that
2010-08-10T19:30:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	and here is why: If the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the upgrade then that will be listed as "kept-back".
2010-08-10T19:37:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	well, it got the packages you wanted, but ya got a broken on in there now :-)
2010-08-10T19:41:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	I'd recommend, reinstalling your gtstreamer as there's clearly broken players / incompatible codecs depending on what you've brought forward and done since initial install.
2010-08-10T19:43:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	pass, I dont know.
2010-08-10T19:46:00.000Z	KE1HA	Linux	that's how to install things.
