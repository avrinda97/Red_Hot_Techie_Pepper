2005-12-13T06:49:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	an install CD will do that for you.
2005-12-13T06:49:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	just the one, or you can get one shipped to you (free!) via ShipIt.
2005-12-13T06:50:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	in that case, you can download the ISO.
2005-12-13T06:51:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	where do you live? I'll find you a fast mirror.
2005-12-13T06:52:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	x86, AMD64 or PPC?
2005-12-13T06:52:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	probably to another machine, yes.
2005-12-13T06:52:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	http://mirror.yousendit.com/ubuntu/5.10/ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso is the one you want.
2005-12-13T06:53:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	I've never used it.
2005-12-13T06:54:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	I don't know if that's exactly what you would want.
2005-12-13T07:00:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	unfortunately, we have no NTFS write support.
2005-12-13T07:01:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	it's just not easy.
2005-12-13T08:42:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	it *is* possible from AMSN.

2005-12-13T08:58:00.000Z	illustre	YukiIkyuta	can you shed morel light how to install amsn with synaptic
2005-12-13T08:58:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	illustre	yes, you can install AMSN. Did you enable the universe repository?
