2006-12-13T12:25:00.000Z	avis		not much difference in the install its pretty much a piece of cake using the alternate 6.10 cd
2006-12-13T12:26:00.000Z	avis		latty is the light on the atapi device coming on trying to boot before it jumps to windows ?

2006-12-13T12:27:00.000Z	avis		aptitude is nice to use sometimes when your unsure because it will install recommended packages.. ie aptitude install <package>

2006-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	Lattyware		<avis> latty is the light on the atapi device coming on trying to boot before it jumps to windows ?
2006-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	avis		ok
2006-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	Lattyware		sorry, was a while back, I had to ring him :P
2006-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	avis		then it might either be a bad burn or a bad md5 hash for that cd.
2006-12-13T12:30:00.000Z	Lattyware		Nope, I told him to check
2006-12-13T12:30:00.000Z	Lattyware		Plus it boots on another machine.
2006-12-13T12:30:00.000Z	avis		if your on windows you can download a really lame windows accelerator and download it with 4 simulateneous connections.  it'll be quickest that way.  though most people will tell you to check the md5 of the cd first because it doesn't seem to have burned right
2006-12-13T12:31:00.000Z	avis	caffiendo	 interested in how what is done ?
2006-12-13T12:31:00.000Z	avis		oh yes
2006-12-13T12:31:00.000Z	avis		i have heard of prozilla
2006-12-13T12:31:00.000Z	avis		its very nice for console
2006-12-13T12:31:00.000Z	Lattyware	avis	So yeah, the CD definatly boots on another machine.
