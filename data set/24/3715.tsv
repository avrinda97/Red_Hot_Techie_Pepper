2007-12-25T07:22:00.000Z	zaxius	RequinB4	no but how would i know if it's hibernating or suspended?
2007-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	RequinB4		Hello Joelito, welcome to ubuntu
2007-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	RequinB4	zaxius	- i'm sorry, i'm confused as to what your question is and where you are, my bad O.o
2007-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	zaxius	RequinB4	i'm on a laptop, hibernate = save state to memory and completely power off, suspend/standby = low power state.
2007-12-25T07:23:00.000Z	zaxius	RequinB4	but i'll give that a shot
2007-12-25T07:24:00.000Z	RequinB4	zaxius	- Yes, i am on a laptop as well.  You can acess the GUI hybernate by going to your shut down menu.  For me, i press the button that looks like a log out or a guy running or something.  Or, i can press the power button.
2007-12-25T07:25:00.000Z	zaxius		k thanks man, i'll give it a shot.
2007-12-25T07:26:00.000Z	RequinB4		boo - to mount a hard drive just go to nautlius and right click mount
2007-12-25T07:35:00.000Z	zaxius	RequinB4	didn't work, maybe cuz i'm running wubi.
2007-12-25T07:35:00.000Z	zaxius	RequinB4	it just hung with a flashing cursor in the corner of the screen.
