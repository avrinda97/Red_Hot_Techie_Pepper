2010-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey		I have a hopelessly locked system here, looked up REISUB, and tried it - no luck. Suggestions?
2010-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	please explain, what happened, how it happened and what you've attempted
2010-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	my wireless connection dropped, wasn't using the system, it just decided to quit. This is the first time. U9.10, latest kernel.
2010-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	I tried Alt+PrintScr REISUB, but nothing happened.
2010-04-05T05:14:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	upper case reisub, by the way.
2010-04-05T05:15:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	might sound silly have you tried restarting, checking router wireless key, checking your router actually connects to the internet and I have no clue what reisub is
2010-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	thanks.
2010-04-05T05:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	readin logs aint fun and not easy your going to read it line per line
2010-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	no sweat for me, do you know what log? I found something interesting, in messages - it shows eth0 entering promiscuous mode. I'm not using eth0.
2010-04-05T05:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	google it thats the best advise I can give you when you find messages like that
2010-04-05T05:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	Tell you what, when and if I find what I'm looking for I'll let you know. ;)
2010-04-05T05:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	ok
2010-04-05T05:39:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	system>Pref..>power management
2010-04-05T05:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	As I said, that is disabled.
2010-04-05T05:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	you sure, on mine it is set to never put the system to sleep unless its a bios issue
2010-04-05T05:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	I'm sure. The system is a power edge server, I went through the bios prior to install. I think I will disable ACPI, been wanting too anyway.
2010-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	Update, pm-utils and acpid were still active - even though they were "disabled" They no longer exist on my system :)
2010-04-05T05:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	i ahve no clue what youre trying to achieve but hope you dont break your system
2010-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	It's a desktop, and I don't want / need power management. It crashed my system, so it goes away. That's it, that's all.
2010-04-05T05:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	oh ok fair enough
2010-04-05T06:00:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	yeah, it's been dropping the wireless connection (what I thought was) randomly, but this time I decided to look into it rather than live with it. Power management.
2010-04-05T06:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	if it works for you without a problem than problem solved
2010-06-19T10:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Pirate_Hunter	he is just getting his server up for the first time.
2010-06-19T10:54:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	greezmunkey	Oh :s I wasn't aware...
