2009-03-24T02:47:00.000Z	Predominant		Hey, I am using a MacBook pro sshing into a ubuntu server, and the delete key is doing the same as a PC delete, when it should operate like a backspace. How can I change that?
2009-03-24T02:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	hm. there was a way to fix that.
2009-03-24T02:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	in the mean time, you can use ctrl-h to delete things.
2009-03-24T02:48:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	yuck!
2009-03-24T02:49:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	Fn+delete works, its just slow, and sometimes I forget, and delete the wrong stuff
2009-03-24T02:49:00.000Z	Chousuke		ctrl-h is not that bad if you have a control key in the right place, but anyway
2009-03-24T02:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	you could also try another terminal, like iTerm
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	I think iTerm defaults to the Linuxy behaviour.
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	I'm sshing using OSX's terminal to ubuntu server.
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	Its the server thats doign weirdness, and its configurable, somehow.
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	it's not the server.
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	As I connect to a lot of other servers, and dont have an issue
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	it's OS X, it uses a different delete character than linux.
2009-03-24T02:50:00.000Z	Predominant	Chousuke	I connect to a lot of gentoo, debian and freebsd servers, and have not had this issue, though
2009-03-24T02:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	hm :/
2009-03-24T02:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	do you have an .inputrc on the ubuntu server?
2009-03-24T02:51:00.000Z	Predominant		Checking
2009-03-24T02:51:00.000Z	Predominant		nope
2009-03-24T02:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	Predominant	there was some inputrc setting that can be used to fix this I think but I can't remember what it is.
2009-03-24T02:53:00.000Z	Predominant		keycode 14 / 11, I think
2009-03-24T02:53:00.000Z	Predominant		I will mess with that
2009-03-24T02:53:00.000Z	Predominant		Thanks Chousuke
