2011-05-15T06:17:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	no PM's please post in here using my name
2011-05-15T06:18:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	your video card is properly setup? you are using the correct drivers?
2011-05-15T06:18:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	i downloaded freeglut3 and the drivers for my video card
2011-05-15T06:19:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	what kind of card is it?
2011-05-15T06:19:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	when i do the test to see if opengl is working it keeps telling me "no opengl support on this system"
2011-05-15T06:19:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	what kind of card is it?
2011-05-15T06:19:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	its an nvidia gtx 570
2011-05-15T06:20:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	install the drivers using system/additional hardware
2011-05-15T06:20:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	i'll give that a shot, but not even sure what that means or how
2011-05-15T06:21:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	click system in your panel then in admin or preferences youll have an "Additional Drivers" section. it will install the correct nvidia drivers
2011-05-15T06:22:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	i'll try that right now
2011-05-15T06:22:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	please do, becasue that AD thing will allow you to enable the third party drivers, such as nvidias
2011-05-15T06:35:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	ok so i went to the additional drivers thing and it only shows "nvidia accelerated graphics driver (version current) (recommended). it says "this driver is activated but not currently in use" and only option it gives me is to remove it, should i remove it?
2011-05-15T06:36:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	ya remove it then reboot, the use the same method for reinstalling, and look for a checkbox or confirmation about using third party drivers. use the recommended one, not the newest one
2011-05-15T06:37:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	ok thanks
2011-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	so when i reboot my screen just stayed purple and wouldn't do anything, but i can do the control alt f1 and get to the terminal thing
2011-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	how can i get to the additional drivers thing from the terminal?
2011-05-15T21:07:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	i need your help
2011-05-15T21:08:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	whats up?
2011-05-15T21:09:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	yesterday you were helping with the opengl thing, i disabled the thing in the additional drivers, reboot, then reenabled it and i still get the no opengl support on this system error
2011-05-15T21:09:00.000Z	LAcan	alfe	is the driver showin as being used in "Additional Drivers"?
2011-05-15T21:10:00.000Z	alfe	LAcan	no it says "this driver is activated but not currently in use"
