2005-04-16T12:28:00.000Z	HappyPills	ryman	goto applications => sound and video => volume control... I'm sure you've already tried this route out though...

2005-04-16T12:39:00.000Z	HappyPills	ryman	did you use alsa to configure your card?

2005-04-16T12:48:00.000Z	ryman	HappyPills	I dont know what is alsa .. can you show me ?
