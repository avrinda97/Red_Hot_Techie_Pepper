2007-03-18T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	You'll want to change that password
2007-05-08T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Disable that repository.
2007-05-08T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	err... wait.  What version of ubuntu are you running currently?
2007-05-08T06:39:00.000Z	needhelp	Flannel	I've just upgradet 606 to 610
2007-05-08T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Why do you still have a breezy repository in your sources.list then?
2007-05-08T06:39:00.000Z	needhelp	Flannel	dunno... is there a simple command to remove it ?
2007-05-08T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	yeah, open up /etc/apt/sources.list and remove it (or comment it out)
2007-05-08T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	no need.   Just comment out that repository, and ... well, any other odd ones
2007-05-08T06:45:00.000Z	needhelp	Flannel	Ok, I've now commented out the one and only line I could find in sources.list about "reezy", this line: "deb http://repos.knio.it/ breezy main contrib non-free". Same result now, except it hangs at "Fetching file 28 of 28" instead of "28 of 29". You may see the sources.list file here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19714/
2007-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	comment that out too.  apparently that repository (which is run by someone else) is down at the moment (or maybe disappeared completely), but.  Commment out that last one too.
2007-05-08T06:49:00.000Z	needhelp	Flannel	thanks. One step further now :-)
2008-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Unlikely that you lost your files.  What do you mean by "wont power on again"?
2008-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	needhelp	Flannel	nothing happens when pressing the power button
2008-03-12T05:46:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	aright, then it's extremely unlikely you've lost data (well, except what was unsaved when you lost power).  You've just got a regular hardware problem
2008-03-12T05:47:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Thats hard to diagnose confidently over IRC, but is a possibility.
2008-03-26T00:13:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	please ask the mint people for help with mint.
2008-08-22T22:34:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	renaming stuff in sources.list.d won't do anything
2009-01-03T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Yes.  See the wikipages ubottu told you abou
2009-01-03T07:48:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots has a link
2009-01-03T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Is linked to on that page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
2009-01-03T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Just run it, its python.
2009-01-03T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	needhelp	Try #supybot for general supybot stuffs, which is the majority of it.
