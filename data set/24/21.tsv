2012-11-23T21:52:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler		Hello
2012-11-23T21:52:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler		Is there bactrack repository i can enable in ubuntu to use backtrack apps?
2012-11-23T21:54:00.000Z	ok_wait	TeraQuibbler	i installed backtrack 5 r2 then added the ubuntu repos to upgrade to precise. once you do this you won't receive updates from backtrack
2012-11-23T21:54:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	i didnt understand. You installed backtrack 5r2 (which is based on 10.04 ubuntu) and upgraded to ubuntu 12?
2012-11-23T21:55:00.000Z	ok_wait	TeraQuibbler	that's correct
2012-11-23T21:55:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	and if do this i wont get the new apps that come from backtrack?
2012-11-23T21:55:00.000Z	ok_wait	TeraQuibbler	that's correct as well
2012-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	then whats the point of this. You installed backtrack for its apps, if you wanted ubuntu you would install plain ubuntu.
2012-11-23T21:56:00.000Z	ok_wait		i wanted backtrack but i didn't want it to always run in root and i didn't want it to look like backtrack
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	but now you got outdated apps
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	ok_wait		that's ok with me
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	ok_wait		i got what i wanted from it
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	Is it impossible got both repos?
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	ok_wait		yes
2012-11-23T21:57:00.000Z	ok_wait		too many problems
2012-11-23T21:58:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	btw you could just create a normal user for bt, i did that in the past for casual uses.
2012-11-23T21:58:00.000Z	ok_wait		yea i did that
2012-11-23T21:59:00.000Z	ok_wait		this is an everyday use machine so i wanted the everyday use repositories. i don't do pentesting every day
2012-11-23T22:00:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	Basically the solution i found to avoid dualbooting of everyday distro and pentest distro is using gentoo. Gentoo allows you to enable the overlay of gentoo-based distro (pentoo) which has as many pentesting apps as backtrack. So everytime you upgrade you get the latest gentoo apps and the latest pentoo apps. (If some app is common in them, the newest is chosen)
2012-11-23T22:00:00.000Z	ok_wait		if i ever wanted to upgrade to bt5 r3 or r4 i would leave the home partition un-formated and format / for bt the add the repos for ubuntu again
2012-11-23T22:00:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	also you can enable gentoo-hardened kernel and confguration to have a safe system on top of that
2012-11-23T22:01:00.000Z	ok_wait		i'll keep that in mind. there are other defaults that come with bt (scripts etc.) that i wanted as well
2012-11-23T22:02:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	anyway i am off. I think for your case gentoo would work wonders. (And you have to compile max 5 minutes a day if there is an upgrade)
2012-11-23T22:02:00.000Z	TeraQuibbler	ok_wait	i think they got them too. Some people in pentoo channel are the same as backtrack. They just wanted a more customisable distro than plain backtrack.
