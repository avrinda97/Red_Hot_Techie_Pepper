2012-06-23T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	again, ease up on the enter key, you can type very long lines, it doesn't cost any more and breaks up your question less, making it actually readable
2012-06-23T19:07:00.000Z	soft_		#l3top please help
2012-06-23T19:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	if you reboot and run:  echo 5 | sudo tee sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness      is it ok?
2012-06-23T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		oops
2012-06-23T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	if you reboot and run:  echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness      is it ok?
2012-06-23T19:09:00.000Z	soft_		what is  follow ActionParsnips instructions
2012-06-23T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	if you run it, does the brightness change?
2012-06-23T19:10:00.000Z	soft_		i don't think
2012-06-23T19:10:00.000Z	soft_		where i must write this code
2012-06-23T19:11:00.000Z	soft_		L3top:
2012-06-23T19:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	does the command change the brightness ok?
2012-06-23T19:16:00.000Z	soft_		yes it's change
2012-06-23T19:16:00.000Z	soft_		but
2012-06-23T19:17:00.000Z	soft_		it will still run until reboot
2012-06-23T19:18:00.000Z	soft_	ActionParsnip	<soft_> yes it's change
2012-06-23T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	then add that in /etc/rc.local   above the exit 0 line...
2012-06-23T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	soft_	you don't strictly need the sudo in the command as all commands there will run as root
