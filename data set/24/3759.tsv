2007-10-21T07:49:00.000Z	Anick		Is any one willing to do a remote desktop and help me with getting the visual effect to work on ubuntu 7.10 with a ati video card
2007-10-21T07:50:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	ok if you go into restricted drivers manager, is the ati driver installed?
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	yes
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	and if you go to system -> preferences -> appearance on the effects tab
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	and you check the middle box.. what happens?
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	no it will not let me enable them
2007-10-21T07:51:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	they are greyed out?
2007-10-21T07:52:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	no i can click on them but a box comes up saying Desktop effect could not be enabled
2007-10-21T07:52:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	then its not available for your computer
2007-10-21T07:53:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	why not
2007-10-21T07:53:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	because your hardware doesnt support it.. or for a bunch of reasons, ubuntu has determined that it cant run it on your computer
2007-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	one other thing.. did you restart after you installed the ati drivers?
2007-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	I have an P4 2.8, ATI 9800 pro 1 gig ram
2007-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	yes
2007-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	and ati makes very poor drivers for linux...
2007-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	oh
2007-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	so no eye candy for me :(
2007-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	it works really well on my nvidia card.. even though its pretty old.. i have a geforce 3 and it still works
2007-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	yeah that is an old card
2007-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	but i can still do almost all the effects
2007-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	my other comp has a geforce fx5200 and it works great also..
2007-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	i'll have to try on my work pc it was a nvidia
2007-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	chowmeined	Anick	yup.. just installed the driver from the restricted drivers manager.. then clicked the checkbox and they started working
2007-10-21T08:00:00.000Z	Anick	chowmeined	yeah im new to this linux thing as you could tell but hope i get the hang of it
