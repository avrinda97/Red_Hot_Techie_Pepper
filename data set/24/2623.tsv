2008-10-20T07:03:00.000Z	RazorsKiss		I'm trying to install ubuntu on an older laptop - I've gone through 4 cds to try and get a "good" burn - the problem is, they verify correctly on my desktop.  When I check it on the laptop, they all fail the integrity check, although I *just* did on on the desktop.  Bad cd drive?
2008-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	RazorsKiss		the md5 is correct - on the iso, and the cd
2008-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	bad drive or maybe the drive doesn't like the media that you are burning on.
2008-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	try a different brand of cdr or a slower like 4x burn speed
2008-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	just installed puppy with the same media batch, earlier today
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	then try a 4x burn.
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	everything has been 4x and below
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	first two were 4x, 3rd was 2x, 4th was 1x
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	hrm.. thats wierd that they are failing.
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	they don't fail on the desktop.
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	there are other methods of installing.
2008-10-20T07:09:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	intrepid support is in #ubuntu+1  that may be your whole problem.
2008-10-20T07:09:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	intrepid?
2008-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	this is the alternate install cd for hardy.
2008-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	lol nvm that was someones name you typed
2008-10-20T07:11:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	it's frustrating.  Nothing's workin for me :/
2008-10-20T07:11:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	plus, I'm almost out of cds :D
2008-10-20T07:11:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	well I highly doubt all those cds are bad.
2008-10-20T07:12:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	its most likely an issue witht he drive you are using. As I mentioned before there are other ways to install via usb. etc...
2008-10-20T07:14:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	can't boot from usb
2008-10-20T07:14:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	old sony vaio, no usb-boot support
2008-10-20T07:14:00.000Z	histo	RazorsKiss	what about a network install
2008-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	dunno - it might work, but it's wiped right now - I'll check it out, and see
2008-10-20T07:32:00.000Z	RazorsKiss	histo	going to try making one partition a bootable "cd", and booting from that to install to another :D
