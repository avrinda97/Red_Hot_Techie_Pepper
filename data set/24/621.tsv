2012-04-24T05:56:00.000Z	gmachine_24		Interested in encrypting an entire install. I know I can do this on a new install - there is a box to check. Does this install LUKS? I installed TrueCrypt on one computer to encrypt a portion of the hard drive.
2012-04-24T05:57:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	the installer has an option for an encrypted home, but i dont think it has a full disk encryption. the alternate installer probably supports full disk through dmcrypt
2012-04-24T05:59:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	yes, what I've read says I need the alternate install disc, which is no problem. Pardon my lack of knowledge - but does Ubuntu use LVM? I can't tell from what I've read and there is an lvm2 package in the repositories.
2012-04-24T05:59:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	lvm would also be supported through the alternate installer (the alternate installer is just the debian installer)
2012-04-24T06:00:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	should I just install the latest debian os then?
2012-04-24T06:01:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	no. its the debian installer and supports all the options the debian installer supports, but it installs ubuntu
2012-04-24T06:01:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	ok.
2012-04-24T06:06:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	why would you recommend iceweasal?!?!?!
2012-04-24T06:06:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	why not just use firefox
2012-04-24T06:07:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	I did not *recommend* it. I said he could try it. Well, OK, I guess that is a recommendation.
2012-05-05T20:37:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	use an encrypted filesystem
2012-05-05T20:37:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	or an oven
2012-05-05T20:38:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	actually, that is what I'm moving to - I am creating an encrypted area on the hard drives of my comps - but want to wipe everything clean first.
2012-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	I suppose I could create the encrypted partition first and then wipe the rest - that would save time.
2012-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	there isn't anything else you can do. you just have to write it all out with random data multiple times
2012-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	agreed. I was just hoping for something a little faster.
2012-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	but if you just add an encrypted partition there will be areas of the encrypted partition which are never used and plaintext can be recovered from those areas
2012-05-05T20:40:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	again, agreed - but that's if someone can break the encryption
2012-05-05T20:41:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	no. the encrypted partition will leave gaps which are not used (the same way any other filesystem partition will be) so you see a cipherblock and then an unallocated block which might contain plaintext from a previous fs
2012-05-05T20:41:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	ah, OK, thanks. Good point.
2012-05-05T20:42:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	so you have to write to every single byte
2012-05-05T20:42:00.000Z	gmachine_24	escott	got it.
2012-05-25T04:17:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	there is a root_delay kernel parameter you can try if blackmatrix_ny is correct
2012-06-17T00:20:00.000Z	escott	gmachine_24	use rsync or scp
