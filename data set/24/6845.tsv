2005-08-26T13:55:00.000Z	tristanmike		why is there a DVD download of the Hoary install???
2005-08-26T13:55:00.000Z	tristanmike		can someone explain?
2005-08-26T13:56:00.000Z	tristanmike		Like if you had only had a DVD rom would you need the DVD version of the install?
2005-08-26T13:56:00.000Z	tristanmike		I wouldn't think so
2005-08-26T13:58:00.000Z	tristanmike		I'm having a REALLY bad install luck with 2 friends
2005-08-26T13:58:00.000Z	tristanmike		Grasping at straws now
2005-08-26T13:59:00.000Z	tristanmike		Even removing the HD in the BIOS, Windows still takes over and boots, can't get the CD to boot
2005-08-26T14:00:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	you _must_ tell the BIOS to goot from CD. Just about only way.
2005-08-26T14:00:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	to get some bioses to do that Requires some bizarre key presses.
2005-08-26T14:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	I have, removed it completely from the Boot menu, Window's still boots up
2005-08-26T14:01:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	that's what I meant by 'removing the HD'
2005-08-26T14:01:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	tristanmike thats the wrong way to do it -- you need to add the CD to the boot menu before the HD.
2005-08-26T14:01:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	?? I didn't have to do that with my system, can you elaborate please?
2005-08-26T14:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	and no, I don't have a dell, custom built
2005-08-26T14:03:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	all BIOSes have a list of which devices they should try to boot from, and they try them top to bottom. You should have the CD first in that list, or at least ahead of the HD. Usually the best order is floppy, CD/DVD, HD
2005-08-26T14:04:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	I do understand that. what I am saying is that yes, that should work too, but when I install, I just take the HD out completely and it "forces" to boot from cd if nothing else. anyway, I don't think he has tried with HD at the end, will try
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	he says that even when installing Windows, he has to do it from floppies
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	which sounded odd to me
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	thats ridiculous -- unless the PC is at least 10 years old.
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	apparently new
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	Semperon 3000
2005-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	so he is not setting the BIOS right...
2005-10-09T13:43:00.000Z	tristanmike	Blissex	why run Doom3 under wine when it has a linux client?
2005-10-09T13:47:00.000Z	Blissex	tristanmike	some people run the MS Windows version of Doom3 on GNU/Linux because they already paid for it, and the Linux port costs extra.
