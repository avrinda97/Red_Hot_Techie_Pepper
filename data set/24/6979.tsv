2005-08-10T15:43:00.000Z	cafuego	Xyc0	Yes. What does that have to do with routers?
2005-08-10T15:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Xyc0	The AP just hands out IPs. When you get an IP, you need to VPN to the Linux box (which is the router)
2005-08-10T15:44:00.000Z	cafuego	Xyc0	if you access the web WITHOUT vpn, you get a web page and a log entry.
