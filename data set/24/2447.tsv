2008-12-10T23:56:00.000Z	Mi-kun		Does anyone know where i can find drivers for my ubuntu?
2008-12-10T23:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	what drivers are you looking for
2008-12-10T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	what drivers ar eyou looking for, what device ?
2008-12-10T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	well you souldn't need "drivers" for anything apart from rare occasions
2008-12-10T23:58:00.000Z	Mi-kun	ikonia	what do you mean?
2008-12-10T23:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	what else are you looking for, we'll get to the nvidia card in a minute
2008-12-10T23:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	drivers are in the ubuntu kenrel for most hardware
2008-12-11T00:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	well it sounds like you've got some awkward hardware to be sure
2008-12-11T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	wwith awkward hardware for linux to use
2008-12-11T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	anything else you need before we dive in
2008-12-11T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	tux racer, ahh that one should be in the repos
2008-12-11T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	install the package extremetuxracer from your package manager
2008-12-11T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	you do
2008-12-11T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	search for tux racer and you'll find it
2008-12-11T00:13:00.000Z	Mi-kun	ikonia	i managed to install it
2008-12-11T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	we can work on the drivers in here
2008-12-11T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	the bad news is your nvidia card isn't supported by the current ubuntu packaged drivers (that I'm aware of)
2008-12-11T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	not quite
2008-12-11T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	there are drivers on nvidia.com for your card, however your running a bleeding edge card, so they may have a few issues
2008-12-11T00:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	"latest current"
2008-12-11T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	you can use the interneal "nv" drivers which will work, just won't support 3d acceleration
2008-12-11T00:22:00.000Z	Mi-kun	ikonia	i dont even know what that means.
2008-12-11T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	then you'll be fine with out those drivers
2008-12-11T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Mi-kun	then you'd probably want the drivers
