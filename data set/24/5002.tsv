2006-11-19T09:36:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 abosutely not
2006-11-19T09:41:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 if you'd asked your question in public someone else might have had the answer
2006-11-19T09:42:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	I'm new to irc, can you direct me how ro get there?
2006-11-19T09:43:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 what is your issue ?
2006-11-19T09:43:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Trying to record from mike doesn't work.
2006-11-19T09:44:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 open up the terminal and type alsamixer,  see if something in there can'T help you
2006-11-19T09:48:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Alsamixer shows Master and Capture maxed out, but I don't know how to dispplay Capture from this view
2006-11-19T09:48:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 <tab>
2006-11-19T09:49:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Ok, that should have been Master, PCM and Capture are 100<>100
2006-11-19T09:50:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 I don'T have a mic to check , that was my best guess
2006-11-19T09:51:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	I'm using a brand new Compaq Notebook, with built in Mikes, plus tried plugging in an external mike.
2006-11-19T09:52:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 try looking up your notebook model number in the forum
2006-11-19T09:53:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	I've been trying the forum for over a month now, and the list of unsolved problems is just growing.
2006-11-19T09:54:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 my last guess is ,  system > prefs > sound , make sure the right soundcard is selected for capture
2006-11-19T09:56:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Shows HDA Nvidia - Don't know what the HDA stands for, but it uses Nvidia sound card.
2006-11-19T09:56:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 stupid qestion here but have you installed the nvidia drivers ?
2006-11-19T09:58:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Is a new computer with Ubuntu pre-installed, Any idea how to verify they are installed correctly? And, mp3's  play fine, just can't record from the mike.
2006-11-19T09:59:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 if it is pre-installed I would have a chat with whom ever did the pre-installation
2006-11-19T10:00:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	I'm in Thailand, so that's not very easy to do. Currently in National forest near Laos.
2006-11-19T10:01:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	  well, good luck then
2006-11-19T10:01:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Thanks for the time, I'll keep trying
2006-11-19T10:02:00.000Z	Pelo	z9999	 there is a #nvidia channel , try your luck there
2006-11-19T10:03:00.000Z	z9999	Pelo	Great idea, I'll give that a try. And thanks very much.
