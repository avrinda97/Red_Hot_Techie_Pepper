2009-02-05T03:14:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	Sense Key : No Sense [current] - Add. Sense: No additional sense information
2009-02-05T03:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	can you unplug then reconnect the USB drive, and then pastebin the last few lines?
2009-02-05T03:17:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	[ 3248.584738] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Sense Key : No Sense [current] - [ 3248.584750] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Add. Sense: No additional sense information
2009-02-05T03:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	okay, looks like it's detected as sdb
2009-02-05T03:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	what does "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" say?
2009-02-05T03:19:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	it says nothing
2009-02-05T03:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	just returns silently?
2009-02-05T03:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	nothing at all?
2009-02-05T03:19:00.000Z	La_Crem		yes
2009-02-05T03:19:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	nop
2009-02-05T03:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	okay, what does "sudo fdisk /dev/sdz" say?
2009-02-05T03:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	sorry, "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdz"
2009-02-05T03:21:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	Unable to open /dev/sdz
2009-02-05T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	okay
2009-02-05T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	so it sees that there's some sort of drive there
2009-02-05T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	does the drive require an external power lead?
2009-02-05T03:22:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	yes, and it works fine with windows. It's a NTFS volume
2009-02-05T03:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	don't know then, it looks like it's not being detected properly
2009-02-05T03:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	is the power lead connected properly?
2009-02-05T03:26:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	yes, but when I connect it, it doesn't read anything, the led doesn't Â¿wink?
2009-02-05T03:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	La_Crem	there's something odd there, usually USB drives are entirely hassle-free
2009-02-05T03:29:00.000Z	La_Crem	gordonjcp	what means hassle-free, my english is too bad for this jeje
