2006-09-16T14:00:00.000Z	chuckyp		I need a little help myself.  For some reason my windows partition which is auto mounted by ubuntu is showing up as two icons on the desktop hda1 and hda1(2) <--- A direct copy of the first link.  Any ideas on how to fix it?

2006-09-16T14:02:00.000Z	chuckyp		Well when my system auto mounts my windows partition its showing two hda1 icons on the desktop one being a copy of the other
2006-09-16T14:02:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- I think they are both windows one of them being the restore partition fat32 - you can change what is mounted on boot with system .  administration . disk s
2006-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	well when I type mount its only showing /dev/hda1 to /mnt/windows
2006-09-16T14:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	I don't have a rescue partition
2006-09-16T14:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	just /dev/hda1 -windows  /dev/hda2 - /   & /dev/hda5 - swap
2006-09-16T14:05:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- hm - i think more information would be helpful because i am lost. - try sudo  fdisk -l l=list
2006-09-16T14:08:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23671  I don't know why the swap is showing up twice? in fdisk -l
2006-09-16T14:11:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- It isn't a default install configuration but, a seperate partition was created for /prc - not sure why that is that way.
2006-09-16T14:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	there is no partition for proc
2006-09-16T14:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	look at the start and end for the swap
2006-09-16T14:14:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- I don't see what formatting was applied to /hda3 - Is it formatted?
2006-10-09T12:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	ahh beat me to it.
2006-10-09T12:38:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- grin
2006-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	it should spit out the fps every 5 seconds or so but if not there is a switch for it.
2006-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- seems like the dev dislikes anyone using t as a "benchmark" - keeps the command changing
2006-10-10T09:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	thats it ty
2006-10-13T06:11:00.000Z	THX-1138	chuckyp	- would it be safe to script  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop && sudo shutdown -f now ?
2006-10-13T06:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	what is -f option?  i've always used -h
2006-10-13T06:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	is that some sort of force switch?
2006-10-13T11:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	well I can tell you several websites that won't work properly if thats what you are asking?
2006-10-14T11:44:00.000Z	chuckyp	THX-1138	someone else having problems with x
