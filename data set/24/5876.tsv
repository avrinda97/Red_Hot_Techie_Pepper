2006-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	erikl		When I play forward in players (in mplayer) i get http://pastebin.com/631255
2006-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	erikl		I really wan't .mkv to work
2006-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	mplayer works for mkv
2006-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	when I try to jump forward, it crash
2006-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	what if you pause it first ?
2006-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	also crash
2006-04-04T12:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	are you sure totem doesn't play it ?
2006-04-04T13:00:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	it plays it, but crash when I move jump forward
2006-04-04T13:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	both totem and mplayer crash when you try to jump forward ?
2006-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	yes
2006-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	and what about Jhair 's question ?
2006-04-04T13:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	 "sudo apt-get install totem'xine"
2006-04-04T13:02:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	 "sudo apt-get install totem-xine"  rather
2006-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	part of the problem is that the "mkv" codec is rather obscure, I personally don't even have the foggiest on why the trend seems to be moving from ogg to mkv, but that aside, the only way that I got 95% happy with my mkv playback was compiling vlc from source
2006-04-04T13:07:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	just for fun try searching with synatpic "matroska" and see what pops up
2006-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	I'll have to live with the problem as long as I can watch the movie
2006-04-04T13:09:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	I assume it will be better in dapper due to newer libs
2006-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	yeah, but I can't update to the flight version
2006-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	did you search for "matroska" ?
2006-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	I found nothing
2006-04-04T13:12:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	so you didn't find "libmatroska-dev" ?
2006-04-04T13:14:00.000Z	erikl	tristanmike	I hade allready installed it
2006-04-04T13:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	ok, just curious
2006-04-04T13:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	erikl	well, i'm nVidia all the way, and I had quirky issues like that too and well, I told you what I ended up doing
