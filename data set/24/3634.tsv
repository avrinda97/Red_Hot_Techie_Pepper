2007-12-06T11:57:00.000Z	vee_	Agent_bob	good stuff... i am going to reinstall tomorrow. for a second HD should i have it mount point in /media or /mnt?
2007-12-06T11:59:00.000Z	Agent_bob	vee_	you can mount any fs just about anywhere,  there are limitations such as using non-linux fs's in critical places / for example. wont work   but if you are talking about storage media   /mnt or /media  or /home/your.name/storage   or what ever.
2007-12-06T12:00:00.000Z	vee_	Agent_bob	i want the second HD to be able to be shared by all users
2007-12-06T12:02:00.000Z	Agent_bob	vee_	/mnt is a good place for that.
2007-12-06T12:02:00.000Z	vee_	Agent_bob	thanx again
2007-12-06T12:02:00.000Z	Agent_bob	vee_	so is /media/<something>
2007-12-06T12:03:00.000Z	vee_	Agent_bob	currently its in media.... just didnt know if there was an advantage to it or it wAs merely cosmetic
