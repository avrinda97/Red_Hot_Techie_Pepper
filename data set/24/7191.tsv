2005-10-19T10:26:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Are you having trouble with printers?
2005-10-19T10:27:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	So you have successfully installed the printer?
2005-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	johnny	anthony	no ..
2005-10-19T10:28:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	What is the brand and model of your printer?
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Okay, just give me a sec, let me look at their documentations.
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	johnny	anthony	want links?
2005-10-19T10:29:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	I got it.
2005-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Are you running on MAC?
2005-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	I don't see Brother providing Linux drivers.
2005-10-19T10:35:00.000Z	johnny	anthony	http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/cups_wrapper_install2.html
2005-10-19T10:39:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	So which part are you stuck on?
2005-10-19T10:41:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	CD to the directory that contains the file "mfc210clpr-1.0.0-1.i386.deb" then do "sudo spkg -i --force-all mfc210clpr-1.0.0-1.i386.deb".
2005-10-19T10:42:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	SO you have downloaded the "cupswrapper driver" right?
2005-10-19T10:43:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	So you have installed "mfc210clpr-1.0.0-1.i386.deb" and "cupswrappermfc210c_1.0.0-1_i386.deb" is that correct?
2005-10-19T10:44:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Which file does it say it's missing?
2005-10-19T10:46:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	1 sec.
2005-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	johnny	anthony	any lidas?
2005-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Do you already have a Brother LPR driver installed?
2005-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	And you used --force-all command right?
2005-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Did you do "sudo blah blah blah" or just "blah blah blah"?
2005-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	I'm not sure if this is a real solution but can you create that folder yourself and then try to "dpkg" the deb again?
2005-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	anthony	johnny	Maybe try to go on first? I'm a new Linux user myself, just started about 4 days ago, so I'm all running out of ideas.
