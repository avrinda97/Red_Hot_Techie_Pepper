2009-10-30T02:27:00.000Z	EntityReborn		not working(tm)
2009-10-30T02:27:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	X sucks for dual head, and always will until it is fundamentally changed.
2009-10-30T02:28:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	konw anyone who's got it running as it should?
2009-10-30T02:28:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	define "as it should" :)
2009-10-30T02:29:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	side by side, two independant resolutions
2009-10-30T02:29:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	intel/nvidia/ati?
2009-10-30T02:29:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	note, i have a intel 855GM
2009-10-30T02:29:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	works fine on my nvidia boxen, but that's using nvidia-setings
2009-10-30T02:30:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	thats using Nvidia :P
2009-10-30T02:30:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	yes :P read up on xrandr and see if maybe you can get it together
2009-10-30T02:30:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	kk
2009-10-30T02:36:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	thanks
2009-10-30T02:37:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	great!
2009-10-30T03:09:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	I kinda got it working
2009-10-30T03:10:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	seems X doesn't want to let the mouse drag things past my internal LCD's limits, event tho the mouse itself can pass the limits
2009-10-30T03:10:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	are you using compiz?
2009-10-30T03:11:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	erm, I put the effects at hi, yeah
2009-10-30T03:11:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	turn them off and see what happens
2009-10-30T03:12:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	know any tricks to get the desktops extended instead of mirrored?
2009-10-30T03:13:00.000Z	EntityReborn	Tohuw	may I PM you?
2009-10-30T03:13:00.000Z	Tohuw	EntityReborn	now you know compiz is the problem there. Install compiz config settings manager and see if you can find a setting causing the constraint. and no, because I've only ever set extended desktops from nvidia-settings
