2008-04-21T01:48:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	why?
2008-04-21T01:49:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	The default xandros wasnt to my liking...Although, it is much better than Mandrova
2008-04-21T01:49:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	But Xandros is optimized for eeePC and you can install most software by adding more source to spurce.list...
2008-04-21T01:50:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	 I dont know- I just didnt like it much.  However, after installing Mandriva, I like xandros a lot more
2008-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	have you allready tried to swizch to the full view?
2008-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Yeah- I switched to 'advanced mode'.  And it was strange how I kept losing icons in the easy mode.
2008-04-21T01:52:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	I just use gRun to start the programs I need...
2008-04-21T01:53:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	My Nokia works fine... attaching, waiting for some seconds and use it like dial-up modem...
2008-04-21T01:53:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Im confused. Do you get dialup speed?
2008-04-21T01:54:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Is there some app that you use for it?
2008-04-21T01:54:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	The "Networkmanager" of Xandros
2008-04-21T01:55:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	Some seconds after attaching my nokia 6110 Navigator it was recognized as an dialup device (dmesg)...
2008-04-21T01:55:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	I'm using USB
2008-04-21T01:55:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Unfortunately, my Blackjack2 is not recognized.
2008-04-21T01:57:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	Sorry, no idea... Have you tald you mobile device to behave like a dialup device?
2008-04-21T01:58:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	To thebest of my knowledge, I have, yes
2008-04-21T01:58:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	I'm afraid I ran out if ideas... is your mobile phone usable with another distro?
2008-04-21T01:58:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	So, youre still running the default Xandros.
2008-04-21T01:59:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	I dont know.  Im a noob.  Ive used it with M$, if that helps
2008-04-21T02:00:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	You could use knoppix (or another livecd like the ubuntu-install-cd) to try, whether debian recognizes your phone...
2008-04-21T02:01:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Thanks for your help.  So, just to clarify, youre using the default Xandros, and you just plug your phone in via USB, and the EEE recognizes it, and you just go from there?
2008-04-21T02:02:00.000Z	Kleidersack	Shizzo	I'm on an windows pc now, but it works with me eee like you described.
2008-04-21T02:03:00.000Z	Shizzo	Kleidersack	Thanks
