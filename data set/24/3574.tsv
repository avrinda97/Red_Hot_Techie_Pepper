2010-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	glaucous		URGENT: while running virtualbox (I need windows for work), after a while my whole computer will lock up.  then it will sort of come back but I'll have no more title bars, no more network, and system monitor shows Load at 100%. only fix so far is to reboot.  I've been using lucid since alpha3 and this just happened in the past couple days. please help!
2010-05-02T17:20:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	that's more of a virtualbox/windows question than ubuntu question
2010-05-02T17:21:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	it makes my host unusable
2010-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	that's not ubuntu's fault, that would be a bug in virtualbox
2010-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	so then nothing is ever ubuntu's fault then
2010-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	not when it's running under a virtual machine
2010-05-02T17:23:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	windows is in the vbox, not ubuntu
2010-05-02T17:23:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	ooooh man, I was backwords, excuse me there
2010-05-02T17:24:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	no worries
2010-05-02T17:24:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	I would crank down the amount of memory for the vbox
2010-05-02T17:24:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	how much memory free after you give to vbox?
2010-05-02T17:24:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	1Gi
2010-05-02T17:25:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	and I've been working like this without problems for months.  it's a recent change (past few days)
2010-05-02T17:25:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	did you get it from the official repo? if so, please post a bug for the package on bugzilla
2010-05-02T17:26:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	it is from main/uni/multi, yes; not a ppa
2010-05-02T17:26:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	I would post on bugzilla, then post in the forums
2010-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	okay
2010-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	and if all else fails #vbox
2010-05-02T17:27:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	going to try ActionParsnip's suggestion first, then I'll do that
2010-05-02T17:28:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	ActionParsnip, thanks for your help
2010-05-02T17:28:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	np
2010-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	rabidweezle	glaucous	with something as high resources as a virtual machine though, the smallest memory leak could be a disaster
2010-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	yep.  hopefully it's just a problem with whatever happened when lucid went stable
2010-05-02T17:31:00.000Z	glaucous	rabidweezle	ActionParsnip, anyway, I'm off to try your suggestions.  thanks again for the ideas.  cheers
