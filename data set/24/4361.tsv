2007-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	rico		it's a laptop by the way, compaq v3500 if that information is somehow pertinent :)
2007-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	rico		no idea :/
2007-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	rico		didn't check
2007-12-16T12:36:00.000Z	rico		hmm, i can't find a bootable cd in my area right now hehe, though I will try with Windows later
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	right on
2007-12-16T12:30:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	what changed?
2007-12-16T12:31:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	none really
2007-12-16T12:31:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	no upgrades, added users?
2007-12-16T12:31:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	just the usual auto-updates
2007-12-16T12:32:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	cat /proc/scsi/scsi  <-- anythign there?
2007-12-16T12:32:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	it shows my hard drive, no cd drive thogh.
2007-12-16T12:34:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	weird... can you open/close the drive physically?
2007-12-16T12:34:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	yep.
2007-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	how often have you rebooted the system since this started to occur, rougly?
2007-12-16T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	have you tried reseating the cd drive?
2007-12-16T12:36:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	reseating?
2007-12-16T12:36:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	yes, as in, turning the system off, unplugging the power, pulling the battery, pulling the drive out of the unit, using canned air to clear out any dust, then putting it back in and booting it up again
2007-12-16T12:37:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	eck, Ive never tried opening my laptop :(
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	ack... it shouldn't be too difficult
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	hmm, I'm going to try it out in Windows first I guess (this is a dual boot system) and see if it works there too.
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	but yeah, if you've never done it before... see if you can reboot with an ubuntu cd
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	see if it will boot it
2007-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	rico	Gnea	would that be equally effective than trying to boot from it? btw, GRUB used to pause when it sees there's a cd in the drive. now it doesn't.
2007-12-16T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	rico	try that out first
