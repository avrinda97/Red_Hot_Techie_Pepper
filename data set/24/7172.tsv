2005-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	MarsDude		hi all
2005-04-06T13:59:00.000Z	MarsDude		here it's 9:59 am :-)
2005-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	MarsDude		:-)
2005-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	MarsDude		anyway... I have a little question... Whereever I look on ubunto-related websites.. they all thell you how to add repositories... that's fine.. I understand that... BUT I never see explained which repository contains WHAT
2005-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	MarsDude		what is different about universe, multivers, marillat etc
2005-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 universe contains "that which isn't ubuntu" and multiverse contains that which would be in universe but is legally restricted
2005-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	thanx
2005-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 ubuntuguide tells you how to get java, but you are correct on both counts (though "kaffe" is around somewhere, heh)
2005-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	, i found out how to get java,.. but it just strikes me as a bit inconsistent :-)
2005-04-06T14:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 i agree, heh ... i think it's that you can't really d/l it except from some specific places, the "owners"
2005-04-06T14:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 hmm, that rings a bell.  i'm not up on java very much, not sure why blackdown isn't the preferred version in that case
2005-04-06T14:07:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	i'm not sure either, but I just guessed ;-)
2005-04-06T14:08:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	, the problem with sun java is distribution and the license you have to agree to manually... so you have to download it from sun
2005-04-06T14:09:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	: http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/java-linux-d1.html mentions there are even debs packaged from blackdown
2005-04-06T14:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 yes, i see to recall backdown debs from my debian days
2005-04-06T14:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 thanks for volunteering to make one ;-)
2005-04-06T14:14:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	haha... well.. I have never done anything like it , and am not going to for at least a while , while i'm still not sure i'll stick with ubuntu :
2005-04-06T14:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 no, main and restricted are separate entities
2005-04-06T14:24:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	i know, but i mean there is an officially supported restricted repository?
2005-04-06T14:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	restricted seems basically to be "non-free" things of the kernel, modules, or things that most would like to see in the kernel, such as proprietary video chipset support
2005-04-06T14:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 i don't know that it is an official description, but a manual browse of the contents led me to that belief
2005-04-06T14:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 well, i'm not sure any of what i've said is official, it's just my personal observations
2005-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	MarsDude	eyequeue	, anyway.. thanx for all the information...
2005-04-06T14:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	MarsDude	 np
