2009-11-02T09:02:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	how to do that ? plz help me. i am a n0b
2009-11-02T09:02:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	i did it by going into the repair console through grub and choosing dpkg
2009-11-02T09:03:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	ok.. during booting time ?
2009-11-02T09:05:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	i am rebooting now.
2009-11-02T09:21:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	Hi
2009-11-02T09:21:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	any luck?
2009-11-02T09:22:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	i got into recovery mode.. but it didnt respond.. if i press  arrow keys . it places texts everywhere on the screen.. and the computer is still VERY VERY slow and irrresponsive
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	odd. dont know if i can help then. maybe one of the gurus here can tell you how to check for broken packages from the terminal
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	probably wouldnt hurt to run an fsck either
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	ok.
2009-11-02T09:23:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	what to run in my terminal now ?
2009-11-02T09:24:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	i am not very fluent in terminal myself... just type fsck and see what happens :)
2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	oh yeah... that's why you do it from boot
2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	if i cant do that from boot, how to do now ?
2009-11-02T09:25:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	lemme test something...
2009-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	did you get that memo?
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	krishna	TheCheeze	ok.. hurd is helping me now.. i am folllowing his steps.. thanksyou
2009-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	TheCheeze	krishna	good luck :)
