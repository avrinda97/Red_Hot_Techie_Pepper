2012-04-14T03:25:00.000Z	cchildress		hi all. i'm unable to get the grub boot menu to show up, so i can't pick my other OS. what should i do?
2012-04-14T03:26:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	edit /etc/default/grub
2012-04-14T03:26:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	comment out the line that says GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT by adding a # to the begging of the line, i believe
2012-04-14T03:26:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	i have. i changed the quiet behavior to false
2012-04-14T03:26:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	hmm...i may not have done that
2012-04-14T03:26:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	then finally, run sudo update-grub
2012-04-14T03:27:00.000Z	cchildress		ok i'll try that
2012-04-14T03:27:00.000Z	warfaren		do it :)
2012-04-14T03:27:00.000Z	cchildress		thanks for the tip
2012-04-14T03:27:00.000Z	warfaren		no problem. i think that's how i did it
2012-04-14T03:28:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	i think you may want to set HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET to true, if it doesn't work. at least that's what's in my config and i see the grub menu
2012-04-14T03:28:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	not sure if it matters, but i do get an error message during grub.cfg generation, complaining about "wrong # of devices" in a raid set on /dev/sda
2012-04-14T03:28:00.000Z	cchildress		although i don't have raid on this machine
2012-04-14T03:29:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	that's strange. not sure why it would say that then. no softraid either?
2012-04-14T03:29:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	nope
2012-04-14T03:29:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	maybe you should check it out on google before rebooting your machine, if you dont have a live cd ready
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	i do have a live cd, and i've gotten that error before
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	it could be hard to boot it if grub gets messed up you know
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	but fair warning
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	cchildress		see you folks in a bit...
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	warfaren	cchildress	alright, well i doubt it's related to you not seeing the grub menu. anyways should work now
2012-04-14T03:30:00.000Z	warfaren		:(
2012-04-14T03:35:00.000Z	warfaren		i dont see how video drivers would affect that, dont think theyre even loaded'at the time of grub
2012-04-14T03:40:00.000Z	cchildress	warfaren	you, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. i can now choose what i want to boot, win7 boots great, the sky is blue and the world is a happy place again.
