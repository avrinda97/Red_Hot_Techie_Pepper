2008-03-06T20:29:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	no answer for 10 minutes or more? Repeat or, better, rephrase
2008-03-06T20:31:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	ok thanks will wait a few more minutes, but would like to boot back ubuntu from win to try to diagonse on my own, but I believe user name is diff in buntu
2008-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	I'm confused... Just re-ask your question for my benefit.
2008-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	ok if I dl a wav from gnuttela2 or something it plays fine on my ubuntu machine under xmms but if I dl off the web like just a short quote from a movie it sounds terrible
2008-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	what is the codec that opens wav files from websites? in totem ?
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	I am trying to listen to stuff from gnuttella2 I just was mearly testing the sound
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	can you save a wav to disk and open it with 'gnome-open file.wav'? How does it sound?
2008-03-06T20:35:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	when I listen to .wav files from sites, like from a movie clip, I sounds terrible in linux but in win sounds fine and is from same site
2008-03-06T20:35:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	normally, wav doesn't need a codec -- the audio driver decodes it.
2008-03-06T20:36:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	but when I dl from gnutella2 is sounds fine under xmms
2008-03-06T20:37:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	ok will boot back linux and post back to you
2008-03-06T20:43:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	ok if I save to disk and open with xmms it plays fine but it sounds terrible with totem, I have also noticed that .avis look terrible (pixelated) under totem as well
2008-03-06T20:50:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	ok if I save to disk and open with xmms it plays fine but it sounds terrible with totem, I have also noticed that .avis look terrible (pixelated) under totem as well
2008-03-06T20:51:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	how do I change what totem is doing wrong?
2008-03-06T20:52:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	I don't know, I haven't encountered this before. If you want to go down the codecs route, there are some factoids (private message)
2008-03-06T20:53:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	what is totem the front end for gstreamer and ...
2008-03-06T20:53:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	xine ?
2008-03-06T20:53:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	right now can I change which one it uses
2008-03-06T20:54:00.000Z	soundray	cjae	yes, but I don't know how to switch -- ask the channel pls
2008-03-06T20:59:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	just searched totem and got totem - xine and totem - gstreamer selected gstreamer and it removed xine and all is well again
2008-03-06T21:00:00.000Z	cjae	soundray	thanks for your help
