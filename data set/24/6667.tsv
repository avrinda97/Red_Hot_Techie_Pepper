2005-08-25T12:18:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	hui, it does work with ls. yay.. but it DOES NOT with lame and unrar for example
2005-08-25T12:19:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	I assure you it does. * is expanded by the shell, not the application
2005-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	remember, *.wav *.mp3 doesn't expand to file.wav file.mp3
2005-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	if file.mp3 doesn't exist
2005-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	are you saying that lame -h *.wav works?
2005-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	yes
2005-08-25T12:21:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	hui.. i do wonder why i am getting the "here's how you should use lame-syntax introduction + why don't you idiot try lame -? and so on" then?
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	-h means help
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	you have never used lame have you?
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	may you want lame --preset=high
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	-h does not mean help
2005-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	sorry. was thinking something else. I'm a retard
2005-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	ahh. lame only takes *one* file to encode at a time
2005-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	find ./ -iname '*.wav' -exec lame -h \{\} \;
2005-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	 or for each in *.wav ; do lame -h $each ; done
2005-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	other|pissed	wsmith	it won't work because there are numbers in the filename.wav and thus i'll get the syntax-introduction again

2005-08-25T12:33:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	it's not the numerals, it's the spaces
2005-08-25T12:33:00.000Z	wsmith	other|pissed	for each in *.wav ; do lame -h "$each" ; done
