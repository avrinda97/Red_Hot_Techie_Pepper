2007-08-20T14:04:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		does anyone have any experience migrating from sco to ubuntu or linux in general?
2007-08-20T14:05:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		wow
2007-08-20T14:05:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		little crazy in here lol
2007-08-20T14:05:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		sayik: do you get audio?
2007-08-20T14:06:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		toby: get a router
2007-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	linux has no problem with things like sco binaries, you justt need ibcs2 module and to make symbolic links to map the sco style to whatever linux style paths
2007-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi	sayikiran	yup you need a codec pack
2007-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	here is a faq http://aplawrence.com/SCOFAQ/scotec2.html#lxrun2
2007-08-20T14:08:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	I don't know how useful I would be, I haven't used unixware or skunkware in years
2007-08-20T14:08:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		pao: it has follen on me to try and migrate an sco server running 4ge compiled code in linuc

2007-08-20T14:11:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	you might ask the linux informix user group: http://www.iiug.org/forums/linux-informix/
2007-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		pao: thanks!
2007-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		thats awesome I did not know there was one
2007-08-20T14:12:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	any major linux problem usually has a whole group dedicated to it :)
2007-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		well this is more of a "we refused to upgrade in 1999" problem
2007-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	it should be no big deal.  all of the issues I know about can be solved with symbolic links, shell variables, and aliases
2007-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		pao: cool, I though my biggest issue would be that it was compiled to run in sco but not linux. I have to actually find the program and tar it up, move it over and see baout bringing over the sql stuff as well
2007-08-20T14:16:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	http://www.iiug.org/linux/Howto_IBCS.html (from 1998...)
2007-08-20T14:16:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		sayi: install all of them
2007-08-20T14:18:00.000Z	paotzu		Coniglietti_Magi: I believe for ubuntu it is just a matter of enabling the universe and apt-get install ibcs-base
2007-08-20T14:19:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		pao: thanks LOTS
2007-08-20T14:19:00.000Z	Coniglietta_Magi		=)
2007-08-20T14:20:00.000Z	paotzu	Coniglietta_Magi	no problem.  it sucks when people won't upgrade, but sometimes it is good when you can just migrate to linux
