2011-05-15T05:22:00.000Z	blee		or ssh commands to delete files
2011-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	cablop	blee	why do you need that in real time?
2011-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	blee	cablop	i am trying to keep a current copy of files across 6 servers
2011-05-15T05:27:00.000Z	cablop	blee	it is a daemon afaik, but i don have the reference here now, maybe google server files sync torrent
2011-05-15T05:27:00.000Z	blee	cablop	that sounds interesting, i will do some research on that :P
2011-05-15T05:27:00.000Z	cablop	blee	but a really really dirty way to do that is....
2011-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	blee	cablop	oh yes, ive already considered using git :)
2011-05-15T05:29:00.000Z	cablop	blee	why not `svn add && svn commit <put something wise here> && svn update`
2011-05-15T05:29:00.000Z	blee	cablop	is it odd that I have never used svn?  i only know git
2011-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	cablop	blee	svn is older than git, but not as old as CVS is...
2011-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	cablop	blee	gimme a second i'll give you something fun, but OT, to read

2011-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	cablop	blee	how many are the files you need to keep in sync?
2011-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	cablop	blee	if they're less than 2 GB i have a solution that would work in almost real time and works so nice in a LAN
2011-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	cablop	blee	omg are you reading my mind? i need an aluminium helmet right now
2011-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	cablop	blee	but out of jokes dropbox runs soooo nice in ubuntu and they have a command line version, so you can run it as a daemon until you get something better
2011-05-15T05:35:00.000Z	blee	cablop	can you decide which devices get which files?
2011-05-15T05:45:00.000Z	cablop	blee	maybe that lsync is what you are looking for... and what i can use to replace some things in the local system nice
2011-05-15T05:46:00.000Z	blee	cablop	no im pretty excited about this
2011-05-15T05:46:00.000Z	cablop	blee	no excited or yes exceited?
2011-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	cablop	blee	but be careful, it syncs files remotely, don't know how to sync all of them
2011-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	cablop	blee	?
2011-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	cablop	blee	you don't know svn, don't know C... how old are you?
