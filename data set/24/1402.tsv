2010-05-09T01:33:00.000Z	emghazal		Yay! I finally managed to remove the envelope icon from the indicator applet (http://imagebin.org/96127). Apparently it's not exclusive to Evolution. I removed the 'indicator-messages' package and it disappeared. (I just thought other people might want to know how I solved my problem)
2010-05-09T01:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	yes envelope icon and such is a bit sucky really, how come you wanted to remove though
2010-05-09T01:36:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	I use gmail for email, I do not use any IM or social networking, I rarely use IRC, and I really have no use for it. Plus, I wanted to free up some space in the panel.
2010-05-09T01:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	well in that case
2010-05-09T01:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	have you removed their edited fast user account switcher on the top right as well?  you know for shutting down  and it's linked to the me menu as well
2010-05-09T01:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	if so you will get shut down and log out back in the system menu, where they should be really, and are in other Gnome 2 based distro's since that's how upstream does it.  Plus you'll have that nice upstream Gnome automatic shut down after a minute if untouched, after telling it to shut down, feature back :)
2010-05-09T01:38:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	ooh, good idea, didn't think of removing it. But now I will. Thanks.
2010-05-09T01:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	you can also put the icons back in the system menu,  in gconf editor
2010-05-09T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	nice little tutoral screenshot you linked to by the way.
2010-05-09T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	what about Ubuntu One,  going to remove that as well?
2010-05-09T01:41:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	oh, that image was a description of my problem.
2010-05-09T01:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	oh right yeah, but it looks like a sort of tutoral as well, how to remove it
2010-05-09T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	what about theme?  personally i'll use  human clear looks, with Gnome icons,  so the version before 9.10 as well.
2010-05-09T01:42:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	it doesn't remove the icon. removing 'indicator-messages' package does.
2010-05-09T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	yes
2010-05-09T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	or if you remove  for example evolution
2010-05-09T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	it would not mention in the envelope about setting up an evolution account
2010-05-09T01:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	just like if Ubuntu One is removed,  the me menu, won't mention it
2010-05-09T01:43:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	I love the unmodified Clearlooks theme, with the gray folder icons and all.
2010-05-09T01:44:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	I never thought about Ubuntu One, but I think I'll remove it now.
2010-05-09T01:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	yes they have a slightly later verison of human now as well, that has the grey ubuntu logo icon
2010-05-09T01:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	heh in a way at removing most of the  default 10.04 stuff
2010-05-09T01:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	emghazal	maybe you should change to KDM whilst your at it as well from GDM 2 (assuming your using that)  it looks nicer
2010-05-09T01:46:00.000Z	emghazal	sebsebseb	I don't mind gdm.
