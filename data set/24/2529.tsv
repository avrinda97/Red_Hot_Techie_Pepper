2008-11-16T22:16:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	thats a big bummer thanks man
2010-06-13T02:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	#vbox ?
2010-09-24T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	kill all his processes ?
2010-09-24T02:06:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	good idea :p let me try that
2010-09-24T02:08:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	I tried kill -9 -1, is there a better command for this?
2010-09-24T02:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	why -9; -9 is dangerous.
2010-09-24T02:09:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	even kill -1 doesn't exit me from the ssh session tho =/
2010-09-24T02:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	sudo pkill -u usernamehere
2010-09-24T02:11:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	ok lemme try that 1 out
2010-09-24T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	type exit; hit enter
2010-09-24T02:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	what is the purpose of the script?
2010-09-24T02:16:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	the purpose is for a user to have a menu in unix, with an option to log out of the server, but I can't use exec bash <scriptname> and be cheap :p
2010-09-24T02:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	what's wrong with the user using « exit » or « logout » himself?
2010-09-24T02:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	it makes no sense; they can use an überscript from a menu. but they can not use the syymple « exit » unix command?
2010-09-24T02:18:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	yeah, it's a school thing.. i just can't figure it out
2010-09-24T02:18:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	in real life, exec bash <script> and using exit would work wouldn't it? :D
2010-09-24T02:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	if you want a menu entry that exists a user from his session just make that menu entry run « exit» for them
2010-09-24T02:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	p1und3r	you do not need a script « exit » and logout been there all this time why reinventing the wheel ????
2010-09-24T02:20:00.000Z	p1und3r	erUSUL	cause my professors a weenie i guess
