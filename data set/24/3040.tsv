2008-06-06T06:14:00.000Z	echowip		anyone have any idea why might my video card not be showing up in the hardware component list in hardware drivers?
2008-06-06T06:15:00.000Z	echowip		nvidia 8600m GS
2008-06-06T06:15:00.000Z	echowip		hmm
2008-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	echowip		there is no box :/
2008-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	drash	echowip	it would only show up there if you have the proprietary driver .. Do you ?
2008-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	echowip	drash	i dont believe i do
2008-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	echowip		bobCFC yes, its not there.
2008-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	drash	echowip	that explains it i guess
2008-06-06T06:17:00.000Z	echowip	drash	how do i get them?
2008-06-06T06:17:00.000Z	echowip	drash	where would i get the proprietary driver?
2008-06-06T06:17:00.000Z	drash	echowip	look into a package called envyng-gtk (for ubuntu) or envyng-qt (for kubuntu)
2008-06-06T06:18:00.000Z	echowip		hmm
2008-06-06T06:18:00.000Z	echowip	drash	are you talking about like apt-get nvidia-glx-new ?
2008-06-06T06:18:00.000Z	echowip		or w/e?
2008-06-06T06:20:00.000Z	drash	echowip	yep, you can do that to get the envyng-gtk, but it might be informative to check Synaptic and search for envy, there are a few diffrent packages , all depends on your system
2008-06-06T06:21:00.000Z	echowip	drash	i've done that, and still even when i get the drivers that way, its stuck in 800x600... and the component still isn't listed in the hardware devices
2008-06-06T06:21:00.000Z	echowip		hardware drivers*
2008-06-06T06:22:00.000Z	drash	echowip	does your /var/log/Xorg.0.log shows anything usefull to try and see what is wrong ?
2008-06-06T06:23:00.000Z	echowip	drash	what am i looking for?
2008-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	drash	echowip	an error line in that log starts with (EE) ..
2008-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	drash	echowip	you could pastebin it if you want, i'll take a look
2008-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	echowip		(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
2008-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	echowip		do you mind if i just paste it here?
2008-06-06T06:25:00.000Z	drash	echowip	please don't, that's a big log file, pastebin is made for these purposes ;)
