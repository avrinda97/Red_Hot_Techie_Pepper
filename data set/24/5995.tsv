2006-03-05T16:39:00.000Z	delmar		Anyone here run ubuntu with cedega for their games.. does it work ok?
2006-03-05T16:40:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Depends on the games
2006-03-05T16:42:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	You could, but not on this channel.
2006-03-05T16:43:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	i always pay for things that work nice and impress me.
2006-03-05T16:44:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Cedega has an interface that allows you to mount cd/dvd media, then run the installer.
2006-03-05T16:44:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	All you need is the game's media. No windows.
2006-03-05T16:44:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	ok thanks.
2006-03-05T16:44:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Check the cedega website for any issues that some games night have (they have a useful DB with info)
2006-03-05T16:45:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	No, they'd be unusable slow.
2006-03-05T16:45:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	heh if they run at all :P
2006-03-05T16:52:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	After install, copy the data to where the app expects it, then run the game (Cedega will give it an icon, just double-click it)
2006-03-05T16:53:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	thanks for that. ill note that for later.
2006-03-05T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	It's the current - 1 stable
2006-03-06T17:11:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Ubuntu supports XFS, but you should stick to ext3 regardless.
2006-03-06T17:12:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	No, that all works just fine.
2006-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	ok. so why should I stick to ext3 over XFS which is used on commercial and military grade systems?
2006-03-06T17:13:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Because ext3 is far more mature and thus less like to mess up.
2006-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Well, I can only talk from experience in that respect, and ext3 never let me down, xfs has. Twice.
2006-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	and it wasnt a hardware issue that caused it?
2006-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Nope, I still don't know what caused the second one, but the first one messed up ebcuase XFS's fsck tool trashed the fs after an unclean shutdown and deleted *everything*.
2006-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	blood hell. thats rather sad.
2006-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	cafuego	delmar	Yes, luckily that was 2 days after install, so I didn't actually lsoe anything.
2006-03-06T17:18:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	lucky then.
2006-03-06T17:18:00.000Z	delmar	cafuego	im thinking of creating an LVM, and might go with ext3 at this stage...
