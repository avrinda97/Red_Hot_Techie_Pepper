2005-04-14T14:24:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	wiki.ubuntu.com/PMTesting
2005-04-14T14:25:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	"no acpi is stable in linux yet" is provably false
2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bob2`	the words "highly experimentle" (taken from the link you posted) is not how I would describe "stable"
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	blah blah
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	it works for many people
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	which does not make it "no stable"
2005-04-14T14:33:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	yes, it does
2005-04-14T14:33:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	it works for me.  it works for a dozen people I've personally met
2005-04-14T14:35:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	the forums are not representative of anything
2005-04-14T14:35:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	no
2005-04-14T14:36:00.000Z	bob2`	LiberalTugboat	I don't disagre with opinions, I'm disagreeing with your blanket statement that ACPI is not stable on linux
