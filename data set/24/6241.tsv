2006-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	psusi		this wouldn't happen to be one of those sata ones would it?
2006-11-10T10:52:00.000Z	psusi		or are we talking a $400 scsi raid card?
2006-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	have you set that stuff up?
2006-11-10T10:54:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	yes... I wrote the howto
2006-11-10T10:57:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	please pastebin your menu.lst and fdisk -l on the raid device
2006-11-10T10:57:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	unfortunately, I can't... this is a system at work that I'm building for a customer, and I'm at home
2006-11-10T10:58:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	hrm.... looks good...
2006-11-10T11:00:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	what exactly does it complain about again?
2006-11-10T11:00:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	says:  can't access tty; job control turned off
2006-11-10T11:00:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	that's normal once it decides to go into a shell... what does it say before that?  that's when something goes wrong
2006-11-10T11:01:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	ohh, by the way... are you using the updated package attached to the bug report?
2006-11-10T11:01:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	which bug report? the one in your article?
2006-11-10T11:02:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	yes
2006-11-10T11:02:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	remove the splash and quiet options from the kernel command line
2006-11-10T11:03:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	that's a good idea... and I will do that as soon as I'm at the computer again
2006-11-10T11:04:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	naw.. busybox allways complains about that once it is invoked in the initramfs
2006-11-10T11:04:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	well that clears that up
2006-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	I'll be heading to work later, and certainly will get back with any info I find if I can't conquer it
2006-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	are you using the deb attached to the bug report?
2006-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	yes, I followed the howto to the T
2006-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	you are installing edgy right?  ok
2006-11-10T11:07:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	once you chrooted into the hard disk, you installed the working deb from the bug report there as well right?
2006-11-10T11:07:00.000Z	Gent	psusi	yes
2006-11-10T11:07:00.000Z	psusi	Gent	you end up installing it twice... once on the livecd, then again in the chroot
