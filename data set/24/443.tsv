2011-08-31T00:40:00.000Z	chris215		may i have an invite to #ubuntu-help  ?
2011-08-31T00:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 you have a registered nick?  its most likely Not invite only. but reged nick reqwuired.
2011-08-31T00:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 you did identify to nickserv?
2011-08-31T00:45:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	 i agree lucid is better
2011-08-31T00:45:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	 i have been using mint 11 lately though
2011-08-31T00:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 Lucid? he asked about UUID. :)
2011-08-31T00:46:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	 you have helped me a bunch in the past
2011-08-31T01:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 you resize and make new partition for the new os to install to.  Linux Os's can share the same swap partition. if you dont use the  hibernate to disk  features
2011-08-31T01:49:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	  okay
2011-08-31T01:49:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	 ...do i want to click new partition table?
2011-08-31T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 do you even have unallocated space to make a new partition? a TABLE is differnt from a Partition...
2011-08-31T01:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 i hope you made backups...
2011-08-31T01:52:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	i would like to put linuxmint 11 on here too...   usually there is an option to just install alongside other operating systems so i am not even in this page
2011-08-31T01:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 you need to resize and have some unalocated space..  the installer MIGHT be able to reisze for you.
2011-08-31T01:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 and this is why we dont 'support' mint in here. to many differances..
2011-08-31T01:53:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	i apologize
2011-08-31T01:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 to be honest with you I dont see much point in using Mint these days.
2011-08-31T01:55:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	why is that?
2011-08-31T01:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 i dont see anything it really offers that ubuntu cant do..
2011-08-31T01:56:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	i am used to ubuntu...  and generally use 10.04...  but i like mint11 a LOT more than ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-31T01:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 not tht ivve ever seen.. theres plenty of docs/wiki pages on how you partition hard drives
2011-11-02T18:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	chris215	 not really that ive seen
2011-11-02T18:31:00.000Z	chris215	dr_willis	and jrib:  do you use aptitude or apt-get reguarding software, and why?
