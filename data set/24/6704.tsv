2007-05-01T09:33:00.000Z	kristopher		tgill, it was easy for me too.
2007-05-01T09:33:00.000Z	kristopher		i just dont know whats happened to the driver.
2007-05-01T09:34:00.000Z	kristopher		well, i have an inspiron 8200 lappy from dell with a nvidia 440 whatever.
2007-05-01T09:34:00.000Z	kristopher		and it worked fine when i set it up with automatix.
2007-05-01T09:34:00.000Z	kristopher		but feisty has kinda screwed everything up
2007-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	kristopher		dude, i know how to fix video.
2007-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	kristopher		i'm just wondering about the driver/ restricted module thingy
2007-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	kristopher		its broke, here's the pertinent dmesg line:
2007-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	kristopher		**WARNING** I2C adapter driver [NVIDIA i2c adapter 2 at 1:00.0]  forgot to specify physical device; fix it!
2007-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	kristopher		and from what i've read, somethings went apeshit with the restricted module thingy + nvidia driver
2007-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	thats just a silly warning thats of no relevance
2007-05-01T09:37:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	run this and see what errors you get... "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE"
2007-05-01T09:37:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	ahh. are you trying to run desktop-effects?
2007-05-01T09:39:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	mind your language please
2007-05-01T09:39:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	disregard all that whacky wacom junk
2007-05-01T09:41:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	can you paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log on pastebin for me?
2007-05-01T09:42:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	what nvidia card do you have
2007-05-01T09:44:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	what nvidia card do you have?
2007-05-01T09:44:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	youll need the nvidia-legacy package, not nvidia
2007-05-01T09:45:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	nvidia in all the wisdom decided to drop support for alot of old cards
2007-05-01T09:46:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	yep
2007-05-01T09:48:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	a heads up, your card wont be supported in the 97xx series drivers from nvidia
2007-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	are you using desktop-effects? (like i asked like 10 mins ago)
2007-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	Toma-	kristopher	ok
