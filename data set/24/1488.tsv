2010-03-29T19:33:00.000Z	xenaxon		hello guys, I need some advice. I'm a web developer and I'm totally foreign to LINUX
2010-03-29T19:34:00.000Z	xenaxon		I'm considering switching and starting on linux. but I'm unsure if it's better for me on ubuntu than on windows
2010-03-29T19:34:00.000Z	xenaxon		do you recommend ubuntu/kubuntu over windows?
2010-03-29T19:34:00.000Z	xenaxon		well, will it do me any good
2010-03-29T19:34:00.000Z	xenaxon		I am a web develop
2010-03-29T19:34:00.000Z	xenaxon		developer
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	xenaxon		I don't play games
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	xenaxon		but I need some image manipulation programs that are windows-only
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	for your desktop?
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	xenaxon		and I'm not sure if all programs are also for ubuntu
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	or laptop?
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	xenaxon		for my laptop
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	xenaxon		no vestel
2010-03-29T19:35:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	Windows has drivers for your laptop, Ubuntu most likely not.
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	you can try a live cd however to see whether everything works.
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	xenaxon		I have all drivers fasta
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	xenaxon		I'll try that.
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	fasta		xenaxon,?
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	xenaxon		can you give me a link to download the latest version of kubuntu
2010-03-29T19:36:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	how can you know you have all the drivers?
2010-03-29T19:37:00.000Z	xenaxon	fasta	I have the drivers on CD
2010-03-29T19:37:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	I think you got a driver CD from your vendor containing _Windows_ drivers...
2010-03-29T19:37:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	you are probably too clueless to use Ubuntu Linux on a laptop.
2010-03-29T19:37:00.000Z	fasta	xenaxon	but good luck.
