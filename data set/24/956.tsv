2010-10-10T19:18:00.000Z	Xeno__		-_-
2010-10-10T19:19:00.000Z	Xeno__		With a DVD+R I only NEED ONE right?
2010-10-10T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 one what?
2010-10-10T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 clarify what you are talking about...
2010-10-10T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 you normally burn the iso image to a optical disk then reboot the machine and have it boot from the cd. You dont just copy 'files' to the  disk under windows. Youmust burn the disk as an image file
2010-10-10T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 or you could do a 'wubi' type install. but i dont reccomend that.
2010-10-10T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 its the windows installer on the cd. some wubi.exe or somthing.. I dont reccomend it.
2010-10-10T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 the normal way is to burn the iso to cd. reboot from the cd..
2010-10-10T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	  it can resiuze the existing windows install then. and install onto its own partition/
2010-10-10T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 of course it does..  it can 'resize' as i mentioned earlier.
2010-10-10T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 if you have 30gb free on your windosws disk.. and use 30 of it to put ubuntu on.. then your windows drive will be 100% full.....
2010-10-10T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 defrag and scandisk your windoss setup befor doing the install also.. and backup imporntant stuff..
2010-10-10T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 also the windows tools to resize the widnows hd may be faster. If you know how to use them
2010-10-10T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 you will resize your windows partitions to make room for a linux partitiion. the installer cn do it. or you do be  beforhand
2010-10-10T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 windows has tools to resize its own partitions.. Im not sure if any are in XP hopwever...
2010-10-10T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 you can let the installer do it..   just be sure to scandisk and defrag, and backup imporntant windows files first..
2010-10-10T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 now a days i always keep linux and windoqws each on their own hard drives
2010-10-10T19:50:00.000Z	Xeno__	Dr_Willis	do i need to back anything up if i have Restoration CDs made already
2010-10-10T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 when in doubt. backup imporntant stuff...
2010-10-10T19:52:00.000Z	Xeno__	Dr_Willis	and WTH are the Bots doing?
2010-10-10T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xeno__	 no idea. i tend to ignore them
