2011-01-14T22:11:00.000Z	DimaV		I repeat, just in case. I am running server 10.10, headless and without a WM, and wanted to migrate my system from one internal hd to another via ssh. both hds are in the system now. how would i do that?
2011-01-14T22:13:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	clone the relevant partitions with partimage, reinstall grub (or just modify the configuration if the original disk will remain in place).
2011-01-14T22:13:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	oh, and make sure that /etc/fstab entries reflect the new disk partitions.
2011-01-14T22:14:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	actually, belay that last, the uuids will still be consistent.
2011-01-14T22:15:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	clone with what cli util?
2011-01-14T22:15:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	partimage.
2011-01-14T22:15:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	that will clone the entire drive or indiv partitions?
2011-01-14T22:16:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	use it to clone each partition.
2011-01-14T22:17:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	and then edit grub?
2011-01-14T22:17:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	as is said, yes.
2011-01-14T22:18:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	one of my paritions (well, the non boot one really) is LVM. what should i resize it with to fit the new drive
2011-01-14T22:18:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	in that case, take an LVM snapshot and relocate it to the new drive.
2011-01-14T22:21:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	hm, i should probably say my whole story. i got a new HD and wanted to move the entire system to it so that i can later replace the original drive
2011-01-14T22:21:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	so if there is a better way than cloning and resizing..
2011-01-14T22:22:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	since you're using LVM anyway, why not simply extend the volume group to make use of the new drive? is the original drive no longer reliable?
2011-01-14T22:36:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	sorry, i keep running around cuz i am at work. the reason i want to move my system (currently on a 0.5tb drive) to a new one (2tb) is because i intend to replace my 0.5tb drive with a bigger one eventually
2011-01-14T22:37:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	therefore my mentality was that i probably should migrate the boot sector and whatever else not managed by lvm to the drive that should not get moved for a while
2011-01-14T22:38:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	was there some part of my previous explanation that was unclear?
2011-01-14T22:39:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	you have asked why i didn't decide to just extend lvm to the new drive
2011-01-14T22:40:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	look, do what you like, i merely suggested it as an easier alternative.
2011-01-14T22:42:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	Hah, I am not trying to defend my self. I am new to server management and wanted to know what's best to do in my case. Which, even with all i said, is partimage?
2011-01-14T22:44:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	if you want to relocate to the new disk, partimage is an easy way to do so for the non-lvm partition. for the lvm volume group, (which i assume is all user data, home directories &cet?), you could just create another LVM group on the other disk, and copy the data directly. or you can make an LVM snapshot and move that over.
2011-01-14T22:51:00.000Z	DimaV	sipior	would you suggest copying the lvm partition and expanding it or extending it given my future plans
2011-01-14T22:54:00.000Z	sipior	DimaV	makes no difference. i would just extend it, unless you desperately need the extra space and only have room for two drives. in any event, i need to be going home, so i'll wish you luck and be off.
