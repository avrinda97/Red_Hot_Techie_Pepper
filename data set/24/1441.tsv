2010-08-08T22:39:00.000Z	saganbyte		how do i open the network applet from the terminal?
2010-08-08T22:40:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	you don't need networkmanager to get your network up
2010-08-08T22:40:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	i m asking this coz i intend to install fluxbox window manager... once i do that, i will have to get the wireless network up again
2010-08-08T22:41:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	the last time i tried this, i couldnt get the wireless working
2010-08-08T22:41:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	you can't run the network manager applet on fluxbox
2010-08-08T22:42:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	then how can i enable wireless with another window manager.... will it come with its own network manager?
2010-08-08T22:42:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	you can install wicd or do it manually http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless#Manual_setup
2010-08-08T22:42:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	wats wicd?
2010-08-08T22:43:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	i see... thanks for this link :)
2010-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	should i install wicd before installing fluxbox?
2010-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	it doesn't really matter
2010-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	coz i wont have the wireless internet up and running immediately when i log in thru fluxbox right?
2010-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	yeah, that's correct
2010-08-08T22:45:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	then how will i be able to install wicd at that time
2010-08-08T22:45:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	well, you can get the wifi up with some command line tools
2010-08-08T22:45:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	actually that s what i intended to find out how to
2010-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	the link I gave you shows you all of the steps needed
2010-08-08T22:47:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	oh i m so sorry, i ll look through that, thanks for your patience tho :)
2010-08-08T22:47:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	however it's more convenient to use a tool like network-manager or wicd
2010-08-08T22:47:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	okay...
2010-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	if i use fluxbox, will i have to reinstall xchat again or will i be able to use this existing one
2010-08-08T22:49:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	you can use xchat for sure
2010-08-08T23:02:00.000Z	saganbyte	nisstyre65	One last question pleae (ActionParsnip just left), how do i switch to another window manager from the terminal?
2010-08-08T23:04:00.000Z	nisstyre65	saganbyte	you have to log out and then choose fluxbox using GDM
