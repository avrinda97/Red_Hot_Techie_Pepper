2006-11-15T14:55:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		I'm out of disk space.
2006-11-15T14:55:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		is there any compression apps for Ubuntu?  like DoubleSpace?
2006-11-15T14:56:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	to compress files? use "tar cvzf zipped.tar.gz directory/
2006-11-15T14:56:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	I know about tar, and I even prefer bzip2, but I am *out* of disk space.  0bytes free left on all devices.
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		I have a better question.
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	outch :)
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		How do I free disk space without deleting my files!?
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	i guess the easiest way is to upload it somewhere?
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	well I had NFS problems, so I have nothing
2006-11-15T14:58:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	btw... isn't there a dir in memory somewhere?
2006-11-15T14:58:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	hmm?
2006-11-15T14:58:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	i wonder if it is /dev/shm
2006-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	Yeah it's got 244M free.  that's a RAM disk?
2006-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	you can move files to memory, but if you turn of your computer, they'll be gone, so be careful
2006-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	LazyAngel		i'll just google it first
2006-11-15T15:00:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		the problem: /dev/hda3             5.5G  5.2G     0 100% /
2006-11-15T15:00:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		the real problem: /dev/hda2              22G   22G  119M 100% /windows

2006-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy		I was planning on NFSing everything from Windows on to my shiny new 100G drive on my file server, but my Ubuntu there doesn't want to be an NFS server x_x
2006-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	thx
2006-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	so i guess you have to copy some files over there so you can use tar.gz
2006-11-15T15:01:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	what about setting it up as a samba server?
2006-11-15T15:02:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	LazyAngel	*shudder* no way in heck
2006-11-15T15:02:00.000Z	LazyAngel	whiteandnerdy	hehe. :D oh well... good luck. i have to run
