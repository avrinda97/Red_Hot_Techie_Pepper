2005-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	epiloc		./configure
2005-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	epiloc		./make
2005-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	epiloc		sudo ./make install
2005-09-30T13:20:00.000Z	epiloc		oops, i mean no dotslash on the make and make install
2005-09-30T13:21:00.000Z	epiloc		no traceroute does not exist on my system, there are  no man pages for it
2005-09-30T13:23:00.000Z	epiloc		what is so crazy about this?
2005-09-30T13:24:00.000Z	epiloc		i download traceroute.tar.gz / i untar it/ ./configure .... make ... make install
2005-09-30T13:24:00.000Z	epiloc		then mv /usr/local/sbin/traceroute /usr/local/bin/traceroute
2005-09-30T13:24:00.000Z	epiloc		viola
2005-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	epiloc		because i think that at one point or another in my life i should know how to compile and run a program
2005-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Okay.
2005-09-30T13:17:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	which traceroute ?
2005-09-30T13:17:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Or are you trying to find it off the internet?
2005-09-30T13:18:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	What sequence of commands did you put in?
2005-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Did it work?
2005-09-30T13:19:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	You don't use ./make. You just use make
2005-09-30T13:20:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Type which traceroute
2005-09-30T13:20:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Can you use traceroute at all?
2005-09-30T13:24:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Okay.
2005-09-30T13:24:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	That's kind of the long way.
2005-09-30T13:25:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Why didn't you just use apt-get install traceroute ?
2005-09-30T13:25:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Well, except that right now the repos are fraggled.
2005-09-30T13:26:00.000Z	Orborde	epiloc	Admittedly, it is good practice to learn how to compile stuff from source, but traceroute isn't one there's much of a point in doing that for.
2005-09-30T13:28:00.000Z	epiloc	Orborde	I am trying to find vulnerabilities in my boss's network, and I am new to linux but learning ...  currently searching for gateway ips to reroute traffic through my machine via arpspoofing
