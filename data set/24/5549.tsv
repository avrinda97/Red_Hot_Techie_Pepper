2009-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	dash	jrib	not a macbook, a Mac Pro. Desktop.
2009-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	jrib	dash	try clicking the link and reading, maybe it covers that too!?
2009-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	dash	jrib	i started there before coming here. :)
2009-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	jrib	dash	there are hardy pages up for the mac pro, were they not helpful?
2009-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	jrib	dash	what version of ubuntu?
2009-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	dash	jrib	karmic
2009-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	dash	jrib	It didn't work in Jaunty either.
2009-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	jrib	dash	then come back with a jaunty install...
2009-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	dash	jrib	And what will you tell me then? :)
2009-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	jrib	dash	I'll tell you you are in the right channel so someone else can help you :)
2009-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	dash	jrib	How magnanimous of you.
2009-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	jrib	dash	this channel isn't for karmic support
2009-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	dash	jrib	Sure.
2012-09-19T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	dash	ha, sorry, but that is indeed "ridiculous".  No clue how to help though :( Is your keyboard hooked up by usb or ps/2?
2012-09-19T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	dash	there's also "xset dpms 0 0 0"
2012-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	dash	jrib	ah right, dpms is different.
2012-09-19T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	dash	is this a laptop?
2012-09-19T02:15:00.000Z	dash	jrib	it isn't. only powersave stuff is the screen turning off
2012-09-19T02:15:00.000Z	jrib	dash	and you don't have your usb routed through the monitor somehow?  (I'm guilty of doing this once)
2012-09-19T02:16:00.000Z	dash	jrib	nope, it's just a VGA connector, no usb :)
2012-09-19T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	dash	when you type on the keyboard attempting to wake-up the monitor, does that text you typed later appear when you do manage to wake-up the monitor?
2012-09-19T02:18:00.000Z	dash	jrib	good question
2012-09-19T02:18:00.000Z	dash	jrib	next time, i will check. :)
