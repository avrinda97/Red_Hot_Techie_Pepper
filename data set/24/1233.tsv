2011-05-24T13:51:00.000Z	BKTech86		when I return from suspend, I can't start new processes (for example if i try to start chromium it says "Starting Chromium.." and then it just closes
2011-05-24T13:52:00.000Z	BKTech86		and when I boot up, half the time it does this thing where I have to login at a prompt and wait like a minute for ubuntu to start up .. it's so annoying! please help
2011-05-24T13:53:00.000Z	BKTech86		nobody knows how to fix these problems?
2011-05-24T13:53:00.000Z	BKTech86		is natty stable?
2011-05-24T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	explain the problem a bit more please
2011-05-24T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	yes, natty is classed as stable
2011-05-24T13:54:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	i dont know what else to say.  after i've suspended I turn the computer back on and i can use any programs that are open but i can't start new ones because they just fail to open
2011-05-24T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	suspend can be quite buggy in Linux in general
2011-05-24T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	they get swapped out to disk
2011-05-24T13:55:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	it used to work fine on my laptop when i was using 10.04 LTS 32-bit but when i switched to 64-bit it's not working anymore
2011-05-24T13:56:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	I can understand that
2011-05-24T13:56:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	in that case, is it likely it will be functional if i go to natty 32-bit?
2011-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	no promises, suspend depends on many component
2011-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	what about the hanging at bootup?
2011-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	what hanging at boot
2011-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	instead of going straight into ubuntu it loads up a black screen with prompt asking for login: -- so i login and wait like a minute before ubuntu magically starts
2011-05-24T13:58:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	it's at least a full minute
2011-05-24T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	if you don't login, does it start X on it's own ?
2011-05-24T13:58:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	i never waited that long without logging in, I don't know
2011-05-24T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	try it
2011-05-24T13:58:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	i guess it probably would since sometimes it doesnt do that at all
2011-05-24T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	BKTech86	check it
2011-05-24T14:06:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	i will try it and report back
2011-05-24T14:06:00.000Z	BKTech86	ikonia	thank you !
