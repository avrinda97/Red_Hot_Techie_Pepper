2011-05-22T07:16:00.000Z	gdea73		 Is anyone willing to help? I am greeted by a spastically flashing cursor upon boot. This is after 1) installing Windows XP on a separate partition, and 2) restoring GRUB
2011-05-22T07:17:00.000Z	gdea73		?
2011-05-22T07:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	How did you re-install grub?
2011-05-22T07:18:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	according to the guide on the wiki. I verified that I had mounted only my ubuntu partition, then I typed this:
2011-05-22T07:18:00.000Z	gdea73		"sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/0d104aff-ec8c-44c8-b811-92b993823444 /dev/sda"
2011-05-22T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	Do you have more than one hard drive?
2011-05-22T07:20:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	I have only one internal hard drive, a Samsung Spinpoint 1TB SATA drive.
2011-05-22T07:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U		!bootinfo | gdea73
2011-05-22T07:20:00.000Z	gdea73		ok
2011-05-22T07:22:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	I get this error running the script: ./boot_info_script.sh: 353: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "fi")
2011-05-22T07:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	It's not an sh script. It's a bash script.
2011-05-22T07:23:00.000Z	gdea73		Oh. I thought sh = bash ...

2011-05-22T07:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	Do you see the grub menu if you hold shift during boot?
2011-05-22T07:28:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	Okay, I will try that. I'm running the livecd now so I will be offline for a while. hope to come back soon. thanks.
2011-05-22T07:36:00.000Z	gdea73		I'm back... no luck.
2011-05-22T07:39:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	It just says GRUB Loading... and then clears screen and shows the blinking __
2011-05-22T07:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	Interesting. Has it ever worked since you ran grub-install?
2011-05-22T07:41:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	Nope. Sure it's interesting, but this is also kind of an important workstation :S

2011-05-22T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	gdea73	If you need something working now, then you can try booting Ubuntu with Super GRUB2 Disk.
2011-05-22T07:45:00.000Z	gdea73	Jordan_U	Okay. I don't have much *time* now, actually, but I'll look into that.
