2005-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	Emberly		ok, what about a new question?  Does anyone here know the  best place to download the latest point release for quake iii? since I can't get firefox to download it from official sources, maybe i should just ask the question that started my whole mess. :)
2005-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	do you have a link to the page where you are trying to download it from?
2005-12-15T10:08:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	yeah hold on
2005-12-15T10:09:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	from here: http://www.planetquake3.net/download.php?op=fileid&lid=1149
2005-12-15T10:10:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	its using a popup
2005-12-15T10:10:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	can you see the popup?
2005-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	yes. the problem is that when I click 'download', it tries to load it in the browser window instead of downloading the file. everyone here has been trying to help me figure out a way to download .run files but no luck yet
2005-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	ah ic the problem
2005-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	pretty simple
2005-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	they've suggested using wget but i can't because the ftp requires authentication i don't have, and we've tried changing ff settings
2005-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	when it tries to download
2005-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	i thought of that but it won't load completely usually.  and in cases with very larg efiles, it crashes ff. so i was trying to find a more stable way to do it
2005-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	is that really the only way to download .run files? is that how everyone else does it?
2005-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	stop it before it even loads
2005-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	its a problem with the server they didnt set the mime type correctly
2005-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	but every site i've ever tried to download a .run file (like for enemy territory for example) it has the same behavior.  and ok i'll try to stop the load... it's always crashed when i tried
2005-12-15T10:16:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	it says "page cannot be saved link may have moved... yadda" i can't save-as if it's not loaded all the way in the browser
2005-12-15T10:17:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	yeah I see it
2005-12-15T10:17:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	hold on looking
2005-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	hold on I am trying to download it
2005-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	Emberly	poningru	ok i'll wait.
2005-12-15T10:21:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	yeah try downloader for x
2005-12-15T10:21:00.000Z	poningru	Emberly	and the flashgot extension
