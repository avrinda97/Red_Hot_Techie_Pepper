2009-01-01T00:04:00.000Z	conrad_		hey everyone, i'm having a problem with rsync on my ubuntu installation
2009-01-01T00:04:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	what problem?
2009-01-01T00:05:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	I use rsync to sync directories of files between my main computer and this file server that has ubuntu.  Randomly and for no reason now, rsync seems to freeze
2009-01-01T00:06:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	what size are the directories?
2009-01-01T00:06:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	I haven't changed *anything* on the ubuntu computer, and nothing should have happened to my os x machine in regards to rsync either.  I need to back up my files but now i can't.  any advice?
2009-01-01T00:07:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	tar/gz the backup and scp it over instead of rsync
2009-01-01T00:07:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	one directory is around 50gigs, the other is under 10 gigs.  The problem is the size of either hasn't changed too drastically
2009-01-01T00:07:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	ext2/3? over 40,000 directories?
2009-01-01T00:08:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	it has worked before. and i'm not sure if it's over 40k directories, but it has gone from working, to not working
2009-01-01T00:13:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	run -v and see if it stops on the same file time after time again
2009-01-01T00:14:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	ikonia i agree, i'd just let the command run for 15-30 minutes and see if there's any progress
2009-01-01T00:19:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	how many files are in that directory
2009-01-01T00:19:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	17296.  It's started to transfer the first file, but it's already stopped moving on it
2009-01-01T00:20:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	it's a 50 meg file, transfering on a direct connection between the two computers
2009-01-01T00:21:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	are you trying to sync only that one file? is the destination drive full?
2009-01-01T00:22:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	i'd also run a tcpdump or wireshark to see if any packets are being sent over the line
2009-01-01T00:24:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	in a second terminal run the command:   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.10.10                   and change the host ip to your destination box, it won't say much because the packets are encrypted, but you'll be able to see if there's any traffic between the two
2009-01-01T00:27:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	i get the error: tcpdump: BIOCSETIF: eth0: Device not configured
2009-01-01T00:27:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	replace eth0 with whatever interface you're using to do backups on
2009-01-01T00:28:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	that is the device though, eth0 is what is connected to the other computer
2009-01-01T00:28:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	and i know somehow eth0 works because i can still ssh to the machine
2009-01-01T00:30:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	so it's been ten minutes on a transfer that took me two minutes a week ago on a similarly sized directory
2009-01-01T00:32:00.000Z	frostburn	conrad_	you may wish to check out the rsync channel here on freenode
2009-01-01T00:35:00.000Z	conrad_	frostburn	unfortunately the #rsync channel here doesn't seem to have anyone alive in it..
