2010-02-11T13:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	do you have mplayer installed?  in a terminal try "mplayer -vo x11 vcd://1" the 1 is the first track perhaps try 2 and 3 if the first fails
2010-02-11T13:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	is this a file or a disk?
2010-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	do you have mplayer installed?
2010-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	"sudo apt-get install mplayer-nogui"
2010-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	oh it's installed then!
2010-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	"mplayer vcd://1"
2010-02-11T13:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	"mplayer vcd://1" if at all possible if you could pastbin the output from the terminal, if it doesn't start playing would be awesome
2010-02-11T13:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	try "mplayer vcd://2" - it sees that the VCD has 2 tracks!
2010-02-11T13:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	there are GUI frontend to mplayer
2010-02-11T13:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	and you are typing my nic incorrectly - so i'm not getting highlights

2010-02-11T13:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	thanks!  no problem - glad to help!
2010-02-11T13:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	wait!
2010-02-11T13:59:00.000Z	xfact	ZykoticK9	what?
2010-02-11T13:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	are you still using the "-vo x11" in your command?
2010-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	xfact	ZykoticK9	 yes
2010-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	you don't want that!  probably, try "-vo gl" instead - the x11 might not go fullscreen!
2010-02-11T14:00:00.000Z	xfact	ZykoticK9	the command you gave I am just using it,
2010-02-11T14:01:00.000Z	xfact	ZykoticK9	ok
2010-03-23T23:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xfact	it's just a text file - open it with gedit or any other text editor
2010-03-23T23:59:00.000Z	xfact	ZykoticK9	oops! I am feeling foolish, lol, thank you :)
