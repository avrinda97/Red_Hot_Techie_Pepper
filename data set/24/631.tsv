2011-12-04T04:09:00.000Z	MangledBody		Nobody can help me? :(
2011-12-04T04:10:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	you need to be more specific. you said the equivalent of "my car wont start, anyone know why?"
2011-12-04T04:12:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	Sorry... It's about sound, you know, when you turn on your computer, there is inviting melody, or what they call it. But I don't get it and no sound either, no youtube,, rhytmbox, just deaf OS. Till several reboots, when it starts
2011-12-04T04:14:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	run sudo lshw -c sound to figure out what model of sound card you have
2011-12-04T04:16:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	PCI (sysfs), SCSI, but both texts disappear
2011-12-04T04:16:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	it takes a little time give it a moment
2011-12-04T04:18:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	OH, on 4-th try:  *-multimedia UNCLAIMED,       description: Multimedia audio controller,       product: Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.,       vendor: Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.,       physical id: 8,       bus info: pci@0000:01:08.0,       version: 02,       slot: 16, chassis 4,       width: 64 bits,clock: 33MHz,capabilities: slotid bus_master cap_list,configuration: latency=64
2011-12-04T04:19:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	you had to run the sudo lshw command 4 times for it to appear?
2011-12-04T04:19:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	um... yes
2011-12-04T04:20:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	what brand computer is this
2011-12-04T04:20:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	some sort of nVidia, motherboard, integrated GPU and sound card
2011-12-04T04:23:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	i cant find anything online about this device. is the sound working now?
2011-12-04T04:23:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	no
2011-12-04T04:23:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	lsmod | grep snd does anything appear?
2011-12-04T04:24:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	No, that is bad, isn't it?
2011-12-04T04:25:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	well it means that the system is not recognizing the device (which makes sense given that it took 4 runs of lshw for it to show-up). try running modprobe
2011-12-04T04:25:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	Can you guide me, please?
2011-12-04T04:26:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	im just saying run "sudo modprobe" and see if that helps
2011-12-04T04:27:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	What parameter?
2011-12-04T04:27:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	try -a
2011-12-04T04:28:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	Usage: modprobe [-v] [-V] [-C config-file] [-d <dirname> ] [-n] [-i] [-q] [-b] [-o <modname>] [ --dump-modversions ] <modname> [parameters...], modprobe -r [-n] [-i] [-v] <modulename> ... ,modprobe -l -t <dirname> [ -a <modulename> ...]
2011-12-04T04:30:00.000Z	escott	MangledBody	the thing is i dont know what the module is. if you want to reboot until sound works you can then lsmod to figure out what module you need
2011-12-04T04:31:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	ok, it will take some time
2011-12-04T04:49:00.000Z	MangledBody	escott	is no longer here?:(
