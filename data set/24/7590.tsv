2005-04-03T07:54:00.000Z	mayang		Can debian deb packages be used for ubuntu as on line install ?
2005-04-03T07:54:00.000Z	mayang		yes
2005-04-03T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	most packages available for debian are also available for ubuntu.
2005-04-03T07:58:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	I can help you with that if you like
2005-04-03T07:58:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	are you using Warty or Hoary?
2005-04-03T07:59:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	this is a good starting point: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/GuideToHoary/
2005-04-03T07:00:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	you may want to uncomment the lines with universe and multiverse to get access to the largest set of available software for ubuntu
2005-04-03T07:01:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	the packaging format?
2005-04-03T07:02:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	if you're looking for documentation on how to use apt, you can install the apt-howto package
2005-04-03T07:03:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	not the whole line.  Just remove the "#"
2005-04-03T07:04:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	so the first character on the line is "d" (part of the word deb)
2005-04-03T07:05:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	you'll need to do an update after you finish editing that file
2005-04-03T07:06:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	are you asking what I do personally, or what can one do in general?
2005-04-03T07:07:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	the short answer is scientific computing, as well as everyday desktop usage
2005-04-03T07:10:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	the sky's the limit :)
2005-04-03T07:14:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	yep
2005-04-03T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	were you able to find the software you're looking for after adding universe and multiverse?
2005-04-03T07:21:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	yes.  Is that what you were looking for?
2005-04-03T07:22:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	if you're interested in kubuntu, have you seen this: http://www.kubuntu.org.uk/index.php ?
2005-04-03T07:33:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	of course :)
2005-04-03T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	it's possible, but not really recommended, to install ubuntu over a debian base installation
2005-04-03T07:41:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	you could install kubuntu if you prefer KDE
2005-04-03T07:42:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki
2005-04-03T09:10:00.000Z	tritium	mayang	okay, it's entirely up to you :)
