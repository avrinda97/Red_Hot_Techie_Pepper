2006-05-15T16:49:00.000Z	LittleFae		I am in need of a little, hopefully minor, assistance with Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog, and the nautilus file browser.  Namely, I don't want it to run every single time, I click on 'browse to' in an application, whilst I'm running under xfce.
2006-05-15T16:51:00.000Z	LittleFae		Is there a simple way to ensure that, at the very least, this nautilus crap doesn't take over the desktop, then?
2006-05-15T16:52:00.000Z	LittleFae		Well, I installed xfce, and, well, nautilus keeps screwing things up, whenever I try to work with xfce. :(
2006-05-15T16:53:00.000Z	LittleFae		:/
2006-05-15T16:53:00.000Z	LittleFae		No, xffm is on there, as is rox.
2006-05-15T16:54:00.000Z	LittleFae		Thats what I'm trying to find out how to do. :p
2006-05-15T16:54:00.000Z	LittleFae		There isn't an option, like, anywhere for it
2006-05-15T16:56:00.000Z	LittleFae		Nor me
2006-05-15T16:56:00.000Z	LittleFae		How? :)
2006-05-15T16:57:00.000Z	LittleFae		yep
2006-05-15T16:57:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	well you install rox-filer and type rox -p<somename>
2006-05-15T16:58:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	thats the basics..there is a more complex guide for making it start up when you log in
2006-05-15T16:58:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	for example I type rox -p1
2006-05-15T16:58:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	that starts my 'desktop' icons
2006-05-15T16:59:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	using rox, you won't be able to use the 'desktop menu' as that will exist underneath rox
2006-05-15T16:59:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	so no more right clicking on desktop for the menu
2006-05-15T05:01:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	I was a litte disappointed with that part at first, but I've gotten over it.  It's nice to have some icons on my desktop.  You can't create files on desktop either.  You basically drag them from a folder onto desktop
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	I've been trying a few lightweight desktops lately.  Fluxbox, openbox, enlightenment
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	blackbox I should say
2006-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	hehe
2006-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	yeah, xfce has been more of an experiment for me, as I'm actually using it on a debian etch install, not xubuntu (although I have xubuntu installed as well)
2006-05-15T05:05:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	I would recommend starting from a server install and building it up with a netinstall using apt-get
2006-05-15T05:06:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	ah ok
2006-05-15T05:07:00.000Z	mustard5	LittleFae	ah ok, so you going to burn on a different media ?
