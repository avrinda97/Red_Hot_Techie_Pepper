2005-08-08T16:38:00.000Z	stevenj		is anyone having problems with firestater today?
2005-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	stevenj		just thought I would let everyone know that www.google.com no longer works with the official firestarter (1.0.1) but does however work with backports firestarter (1.0.3) thats crazy it just started not working
2005-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	it works for me
2005-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	f_newton		but I use 1.05
2005-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	f_newton		uh 6
2005-08-08T05:12:00.000Z	f_newton		heh
2005-08-08T05:12:00.000Z	stevenj		well until today it worked 1.0.1 so who knows
2005-08-08T05:12:00.000Z	stevenj		no changes
2005-08-08T05:12:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	1.01 is old
2005-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	stevenj		yes but thats the "official" ubuntu version
2005-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	stevenj		so now I use backports and it works again
2005-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	stevenj		maybe it was just me...but that was my solution...for whats it worth :) now I eat. :)
2005-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	mine says ver1.06 and its the one that came with the install
2005-08-08T05:15:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	hmm
2005-08-08T05:15:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	official Fs version http://www.fs-security.com/news.php#release-1.0.3
2005-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	stevenj		versions
2005-08-08T05:17:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	strange because 1.0.3 is the newest
2005-08-08T05:17:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	what does help --> about say?
2005-08-08T05:17:00.000Z	f_newton		ver 1.06
2005-08-08T05:18:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	this is not my first rodeo
2005-08-08T05:18:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	well where does that version come from I wonder....its not versioned like that on the FS site
2005-08-08T05:19:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	 its the latest version of firefox ok? it probably updated on installation of ubuntu
2005-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	f_newton	stevenj	versions 1.04 and down have serious security errors
2005-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	stevenj	f_newton	I am not even taking about Firefox-I am talking about FS (Firestarter)
