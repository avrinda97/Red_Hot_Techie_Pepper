2005-03-27T12:30:00.000Z	jason		anyone know what the best address book is for linux? I want something simple that possibly reminds me of birthdays and is a standard format.
2005-03-27T12:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	there is not really a 'standard format' except vcf stuff
2005-03-27T12:32:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	almost all addresbooks (including Evo) can export/import vcf
2005-06-16T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	insmod is deprecated
2005-06-16T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	ok :)
2005-06-16T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	then do go on with the problem :)
2005-06-16T08:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	build it with the correct kernel headers and compile options.
2005-06-16T08:31:00.000Z	jason	Seveas	sorry didnt mean to be mean with my reply... :-)
2005-06-16T08:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	you weren't
2005-06-16T08:35:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	are you sure that linux-xxxx points to the sources of your currently running kernel?
2005-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	jason	Seveas	yes theres only one source installed
2005-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	ehmm
2005-06-16T08:42:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	have you read the lkmpg (linux kernel module programming guide) from tldp.org?
2005-06-16T08:55:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	/newserver irc.otfc.net (for xchat)
2005-06-16T08:58:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	it rocks :)
2005-06-16T09:30:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	through apt-get
2005-06-16T09:34:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	you forgot the install
2005-06-16T09:58:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	in a sudo -s shell you can still use sudo
2005-06-16T09:58:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	by the way: better use sudo -i instead of sudo -s
2005-12-12T06:13:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	for rt2500 you don't need ndiswrapper...
2005-12-12T06:13:00.000Z	jason	Seveas	Did I mess it up then?
2005-12-12T06:14:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	not pre se, you can use ndiswrapper, but the rt2500 also has real linux drivers
2005-12-12T06:14:00.000Z	jason	Seveas	Well, it seems like it loaded the driver and says the hardware is present but I see no lights on the wireless card
2006-04-15T15:57:00.000Z	Seveas	jason	yes, gnome-terminal
