2005-03-13T10:39:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	You're forgetting something.
2005-03-13T10:39:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	WinXP can be really scary for a Win user ;-)
2005-03-13T10:40:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	Linux "beta" tends to be better than most Windows stable.
2005-03-13T10:45:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	'whoami' shows who you are.
2005-03-13T10:46:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	if there are unresolved deps, in general, the packaging system is saving you from shooting yourself in the foot.
2005-03-13T10:46:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	...and wheres' this "permission denied" thing coming from.
2005-03-13T10:47:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	What package?
2005-03-13T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	...Note after you modify your sources list, you need to update your package list.
2005-03-13T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	what package?
2005-03-13T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	NM.
2005-03-13T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	What are the failed deps?
2005-03-13T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	I mostly use aptitude, not synaptic, but if they're similar, you can go through...
2005-03-13T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	Coolio.
2005-03-13T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	BobaFett	It gets addictive.
