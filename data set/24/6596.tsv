2008-06-06T08:12:00.000Z	tyler_		mplayer is funny you open a video, and it starts playing two seconds later it says "codec nto found" and the video plays
2008-06-06T08:13:00.000Z	tyler_		Anyone no a player that supports SHOUTcast streaming?

2008-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	tyler_		but not when no program works
2008-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	What DJing are you talking about?  Just a source client? or does it need something special?
2008-06-06T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	What does winamp do special?
2008-06-06T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	So, just play stuff?  Have you tried... well, heck, there are a bunch of things that'll act as a shoutcast source client.  mpd, .. um, there are others, they're just escaping me.  ices
2008-06-06T08:19:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	A server? or something to send music to a server?
2008-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	Please explain what you actually are looking for.  The server itself? or the program to get the music to the server?
2008-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	That's a source client, and ices is the plain-jane one (comes with icecast), mpd will do it, gstreamer should as well.  In synaptic, youshould be able to search for shoutcast or icecast and get a decent list
2008-07-16T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	What command are you using?
2008-07-16T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	Exactly like that?
2008-07-16T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	Its because your command is wrong.
2008-07-16T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	you're trying to mount sdc1 at /media/master\ drive, right?
2008-07-16T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	No.  Are you trying to mount sdc1 at a mount point of "/media/master drive"?
2008-07-16T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	You're missing a few spaces, and have some other errors. use "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o force /dev/sdc1 /media/master\ drive"
2008-07-16T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	tyler_	You're trying to mount it somewhere that doesn't exist.  Fix that.
