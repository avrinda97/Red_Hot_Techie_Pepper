2007-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	MindSpark	NET||abuse	try to run dhclient manually
2007-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	MindSpark		and bypass Ubuntu's network tools
2007-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	NET||abuse		??
2007-05-02T15:19:00.000Z	MindSpark		I had the same issue yesterday and this fixed it
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse		oh.. i see..
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse		hmm,
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	MindSpark		su
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	MindSpark	iwconfig essid [netname] 
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	MindSpark		then type "dhclient <int>"
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	MindSpark		yea, you can do that
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	MindSpark	<int> ????
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	MindSpark		but if it is already all set
2007-05-02T15:20:00.000Z	MindSpark		depends on how many interfaces you have
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		for example I have eth0 as wired
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		and eth1 for the wireless interface
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		youd have to check
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	NET||abuse	MindSpark	nope, ath0
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		iwconfig
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		ok, then ath0
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		never heard of that before
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		but give it a try
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	MindSpark		dhclient ath0
2007-05-02T15:21:00.000Z	NET||abuse	MindSpark	atheros chip
