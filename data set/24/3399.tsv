2010-02-19T14:04:00.000Z	peleg		Is there any other way of upgrading instead of using the GUI way, which is not working since I can't change the mirrors?
2010-02-19T14:04:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-02-19T14:04:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	thanks, I'll try that!
2010-02-19T14:05:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	I'd maybe do sudo apt-get update first
2010-02-19T14:07:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	did both, in the order you recommended. I only get "0 aktualisiert, 0 neu installiert, 0 zu entfernen und 0 nicht aktualisiert." -- and nothing after that.
2010-02-19T14:08:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	i do not know your language but it sounds like no updates with your mirrors, you can check the mirrorstatus and go from there I imagine.
2010-02-19T14:09:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	well, I have changed "old-releases" to "releases", so I guess it might be the issue. I'll change it back and we'll see...
2010-02-19T14:10:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	tried again. I have changed the mirrors, updated (update went fine), and then tried upgrading, but got nothing. What else should I check?
2010-02-19T14:11:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	past that I got nothing, do you know for a fact there is an update?
2010-02-19T14:11:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	well, yes. Update works great. also in aptitude.
2010-02-19T14:12:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	what do you mean it works great?
2010-02-19T14:14:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	I mean that it has downloaded some stuff, and then summarized -- told me how long did it take, that it is reading the package list, and that it is finished. updating again does not downloading anything again. sounds ok, doesn't it?
2010-02-19T14:14:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	yea, sounds like you are updated and nothing is in the pipe.  Ubuntu repos are not exactly bleeding edge.
2010-02-19T14:16:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	so what can I do? Why upgrading does not work, without even giving any error message?
2010-02-19T14:17:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	I have switched to English. The last line is "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
2010-02-19T14:17:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	I think we're maybe understand two different things.  If your system is already up to date then nothing will happen.  As I asked before are you expecting a update?  Something you know is out of date?
2010-02-19T14:18:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	I do not expect an update. I expect an UPGRADE. that is, an upgrade of my system to 8.04.
2010-02-19T14:19:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	what are you on now?
2010-02-19T14:19:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	7.10
2010-02-19T14:22:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	after doing a slight google it says do an update restart then do another update
2010-02-19T14:22:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	ok, I'll try that. thanks.
2010-02-19T14:34:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	back to Earth; no change. I get the same results; no upgrade.
2010-02-19T14:34:00.000Z	mrpink57	peleg	sorry man but I dont have anymore answers, this is a big irc channel hope someone else can help.
2010-02-19T14:35:00.000Z	peleg	mrpink57	thanks :)
