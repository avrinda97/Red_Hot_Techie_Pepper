2009-02-10T12:39:00.000Z	dmphotography		Hey, what's the best way to remotely transfer files between Ubuntu and Windows, such as in a remote desktop situation?
2009-02-10T12:40:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	you could probably set up an FTP server
2009-02-10T12:40:00.000Z	dmphotography	bernz	What about securing the FTP server?
2009-02-10T12:41:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	well it depends on how you plan to use it -- one-time bulk transfer of stuff, or regular use
2009-02-10T12:43:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	with Hamachi, you're pretty safe, as they encrypt all traffic with AES-256 (or so they claim)
2009-02-10T12:43:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	in other words, everything going via them should be encrypted end-to-end
2009-02-10T12:44:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	there's a Linux client available
2009-02-10T12:44:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	and it's not too tricky to set up
2009-02-10T12:45:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	about FTP -- you could always pick a non-standard port
2009-02-10T12:45:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	that's a "weak" approach, but it's a LOT better than nothing
2009-02-10T12:46:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	by "weak", i mean it only adds a very minor level of security; determined intruders will be completely unphased, but it's enough to stop "dumb" bots and the like
2009-02-10T12:47:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	yeah, it's surprisingly good quality software :-)
2009-02-10T12:48:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	i'll be doing that shortly, once i finish setting up my desktop (and learning all the quirks)
2009-02-10T12:48:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	it's like the good old days of reading manuals and actually learning (my brain is rusty after several years of mostly-windows, due to work)
2009-02-10T12:50:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	try a command-line app called 'top'
2009-02-10T12:59:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	in some IRC clients, the 'tab' key is used for auto-completion; a partial (ambiguous) completion usually lists the partial matches
2009-02-10T13:00:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	the client i'm using right now (pidgin -- stop barfing, people, it came pre-installed, and i don't look a gift horse in the mouth) adds the colon automagically
2009-02-10T13:10:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	as for photoshop, you'll find the gimp to probably be a more-than-adequate substitute, unless you are a super hardcore-user
2009-02-10T13:12:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	i'm unfamiliar with lightroom (not a photographer myself)
2009-02-10T13:12:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	however, you can run windows inside a window in linux
2009-02-10T13:13:00.000Z	dmphotography	bernz	I tried earlier, but I don't know how to install them in Linux.
2009-02-10T13:14:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	Titan8990 suggested a nice command-line way that should work (sudo apt-get install gimp)
2009-02-10T13:15:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	you might need to do a 'sudo apt-get update' first
2009-02-10T13:19:00.000Z	bernz	dmphotography	ah, that sounds like a useful tool, for sure (i'm a quality nut)
