2010-10-30T19:59:00.000Z	andyb12345		has anyone had a problem loading linux because it goes to initframs or something like that?
2010-10-30T20:00:00.000Z	andyb12345		=having some serious problems and need some serious help and solutions
2010-10-30T20:00:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  yes I have  and it drops to initramfs
2010-10-30T20:00:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  ah ok
2010-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  still dropping then?
2010-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	andyb12345	coz_	yeah
2010-10-30T20:01:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  not sure about your particular issue...does it eventually go to login ?
2010-10-30T20:02:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  and typing   exit  after a few seconds did not work either?
2010-10-30T20:02:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	 did you wait long enough to type exit?
2010-10-30T20:03:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	 ah   ok that is a different issue.... is this an old install or a new install?
2010-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  did you check the live cd for errors?
2010-10-30T20:04:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  when the live cd boots  you should see a small keyboard image at the bottom of the screen... when you see that  hit "Enter"  and you should get a menu
2010-10-30T20:05:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  are you trying to install  again?  or upgrade?
2010-10-30T20:06:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  when did this begin to happen?
2010-10-30T20:07:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  on that system...regardless of the ubuntu  version?
2010-10-30T20:08:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	 ok do you have the live cd
2010-10-30T20:09:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  restart with the live cd...when you see the keyboard image at the bottom of the screen  hit "Enter" to get a menu...you want to test 2 things  ,,first test   the cd for errors or   check fil integrity...then restart again  ,, get to that menu and test the memory
2010-10-30T20:09:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  you want to be sure both the cd and your system memory  report any errors
2010-10-30T20:09:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	 rather you dont want any errors
2010-10-30T20:17:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  let me  check something
2010-10-30T20:19:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  to you have  sata drives?
2010-10-30T20:19:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  do you know how to get to and maneuver in the bios?
2010-10-30T20:21:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	 well you would have to get into  your motherboard  bios  either with F2 as soon as you start the system or  Delete key./.   once in there you want to look for    sata mode  and change it from  ahci  to raid    ...  this may be your issue   ...it is not the only bois setting that could help but that is one to try
2010-10-30T20:22:00.000Z	coz_	andyb12345	  I cant see your bios from here so I cant see what settings may need to be changed...but if you have had,,,as you said...this same issue with ubuntu forseveral versions.. then it is most likely a bios settings or bad hardware... i am betting bios setting
