2007-10-06T06:15:00.000Z	dorothygale		alsa service is started
2007-10-06T06:16:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	What does lspci | grep audio turn up ?
2007-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	it might just be muted. checked alsamixer ?
2007-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	I did it is all the way up
2007-10-06T06:22:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	what happens after cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp ?
2007-10-06T06:22:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	should give white noise
2007-10-06T06:23:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	command hangs
2007-10-06T06:24:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	so ctrl-c out of that.  it did not hang, it worked so far... so the digital domain should be fine, there is something muted
2007-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	still no sound though
2007-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	so recheck your mixer settings...
2007-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	it's all the way up on everything
2007-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	but somwhere there's a mute switch pressed
2007-10-06T06:27:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	I think the dev is hosed
2007-10-06T06:27:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	killall esd && esd , does that give you a test sound ?
2007-10-06T06:28:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	so just 'esd'
2007-10-06T06:29:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	The program 'esd' can be found in the following packages:
2007-10-06T06:29:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	you are on ubuntu, not (k/x)ubuntu, right?
2007-10-06T06:31:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	so there is no default sound daemon. But never mind. Did you go through the troubleshooting howto?
2007-10-06T06:32:00.000Z	dorothygale	stefgl	it's not like sound never worked before. it WAS working, I changed some services around and now no sound
2007-10-06T06:32:00.000Z	stefgl	dorothygale	so follow the troubleshooting howto...
