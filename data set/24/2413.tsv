2009-01-31T09:12:00.000Z	wolter		hi, i get this error when trying to run etracer " X11 driver not configured with OpenGL"
2009-01-31T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	pretty straight forward what the problem is there
2009-01-31T09:13:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	what do you mean?
2009-01-31T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	the error message is quite explicit
2009-01-31T09:14:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	well, it may be for you, but do you have any idea of how could I fix it? my xorg.conf has nvidia as driver.
2009-01-31T09:14:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	I use compiz...
2009-01-31T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	program must be wrong then, edit the source code of it so it doesn't trip that error
2009-01-31T09:16:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	yeah sure, like
2009-01-31T09:16:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	i got it from the add/remove
2009-01-31T09:16:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	extreme tux racer
2009-01-31T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	yeah well if you are using compiz it must be that you have opengl, so if that program is throwing that error, you need to patch it
2009-01-31T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	there may be a force option to it also, you might see
2009-01-31T09:18:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	ok
2009-01-31T09:20:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	well, i think i will wine the windows version.. should work flawless, right?
2009-01-31T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	don't use wine when there is a native version
2009-01-31T09:22:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	well, it doesn't work...
2009-01-31T09:22:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	fix it
2009-01-31T09:23:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	help me to
2009-01-31T09:23:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	just crack open vim on the source, you should be able to search for that error message and then remove the conditional statement that leads to it
2009-01-31T09:24:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	its not a warning, its an error.
2009-01-31T09:25:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	like I said, search for the error message in the source and remove the conditional statement that triggers it
2009-01-31T09:29:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	windows version works like charm
2009-01-31T09:30:00.000Z	bruenig	wolter	you shouldn't use nonfree stuff
2009-01-31T09:30:00.000Z	wolter	bruenig	its free... what are you talking about?
