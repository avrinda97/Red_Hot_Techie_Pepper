2005-05-05T07:56:00.000Z	Levande1		Does anybody dare to run apt-get upgrade from cron?
2005-05-05T07:57:00.000Z	Levande1		Everybody does it under Windows with Window Update
2005-05-05T07:58:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	people on windows have lower standards for stability
2005-05-05T07:58:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	I'd strongly recommend not doing it from cron
2005-05-05T07:58:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	running 'apt-get -d dist-upgrade' from cron can be useful
2005-05-05T07:58:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	so when you run 'apt-get dist-upgrade', nothing needs to download
2005-05-05T08:03:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	there are unsupported 2.6.11 packages in ubuntu
2005-05-05T08:03:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	but they won't install on their own in my hoary install?
2005-05-05T08:03:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	correct
2005-05-20T11:05:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	they have a page saying how bazaar is different than subversion?
2005-05-20T11:08:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	there is a short version of the difference in design goals?
2005-05-20T11:10:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	I guess the main difference is that arch internally works in terms of changes, not trees
2005-05-20T11:10:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	but also that it doesn't really care which archive a branch is in, so you can branch from other people and store it locally
2005-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	like the way CVS is file-based vs. how svn is project based.  The CVS file-based would be similar to bazaar's change based?  And, the svn project based, I think I mean the same thing as what you mean when you say tree based.
2005-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	how is svn project-based while cvs is not?
2005-05-20T11:15:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	when you do a log on a working copy directory in cvs, you get a comment for every file that has changed, even in the same comment.  Say you have one commit with one comment for a bunch of files.  With the cvs log for that commit, you getta comment for each file, even though all the comments are the same.  This is because cvs doesn't version the whole *tree* or directory.  Just individual files.  With svn, you only get the one commen
2005-05-20T11:16:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	it's not like i've got a real reason to switch from svn now anyway (or the time).  I'll keep on eye on you guys bazaar project now that I know about it.
2005-05-20T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	right, arch is like svn in that regard, it versions the whole tree
2005-05-20T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	all modern systems are
2005-05-20T11:18:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	but really wish you guys would eventually do a page explaining the difference to guys like me
2005-05-20T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	that would be good
2005-05-20T11:22:00.000Z	Levande1	bob2	i'm not in a hurry to switch, so feel free to make it low priority on the todo for now
2005-05-20T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	heh, it is, unfortunately
2005-05-20T11:23:00.000Z	bob2	Levande1	there's http://better-scm.berlios.de/, but it's unfortunately written by a svn developer
