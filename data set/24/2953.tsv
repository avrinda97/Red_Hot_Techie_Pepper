2008-06-12T00:15:00.000Z	berry_nl		Anyone familiar with the unix command cut ?
2008-06-12T00:15:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	whats up?
2008-06-12T00:15:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	i would like to exclude some lines from a csv file i have.
2008-06-12T00:16:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	please elaborate
2008-06-12T00:16:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	its a tab delimited file and every second header + row needs to be removed. Thus: Keep, remove, keep, remove etc
2008-06-12T00:19:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	Sorry i said row, but i mean entire column. So the column names are keep, remove, keep, remove etc. Where the entire column (remove) needs to be removed at each instance.
2008-06-12T00:19:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	post a sample of the file and the output you want to get in a pastebin and link me to it please
2008-06-12T00:19:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	keej. Just a second.
2008-06-12T00:19:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	just a couple or 3  rows will do
2008-06-12T00:23:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	http://paste.ubuntu.com/19431/
2008-06-12T00:23:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	every instance of call needs to be removed.
2008-06-12T00:24:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	i see, give me a min
2008-06-12T00:25:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	Thanks many time thanks in advance. This one really got me stuck
2008-06-12T00:27:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	is Gene Accession the first column heading and number the second?
2008-06-12T00:28:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	I can make it work (longish way) if Gene Accession is one word
2008-06-12T00:28:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	Jep Gene accession is the first column. Feel free to change Gene acc. into ID or something like that.
2008-06-12T00:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	cut -f1-3,5,7,9 <file>
2008-06-12T00:29:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	 I do need to keep the first column. Its just the "call" columns whom all need to dissapear.
2008-06-12T00:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	something like that will work
2008-06-12T00:30:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	Okay so i'll manually need to give all the column numbers. But yes that will work. Thanks rampageoberon!
2008-06-12T00:30:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	i'm not sure how to make it more automated but you can do do the cut for all the fields (till whatever number of fields you have)
2008-06-12T00:30:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	make the first column heading one word :)
2008-06-12T00:31:00.000Z	berry_nl	rampageoberon	grin, good thing you mention. I almost got carried away hehehe
2008-06-12T00:31:00.000Z	rampageoberon	berry_nl	if not it will read it as different columns :s
