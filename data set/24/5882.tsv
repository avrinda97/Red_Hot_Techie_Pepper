2006-04-05T16:46:00.000Z	_harm		bye
2006-04-05T16:48:00.000Z	_harm		how do i unrar something?
2006-04-05T16:49:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	install unrar-nonfree from multiverse and use the archive manager
2006-04-05T16:52:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	unrar doesn't exist but ok :)
2006-04-05T16:53:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	are you in breezy?
2006-04-05T16:55:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	you are using dapper aren't you?
2006-04-05T16:57:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	it really troubles me that you found unrar because it either means you are not running 5.10 or you are using the wrong repos
2006-04-05T16:58:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list content and output of the command 'lsb_release -c'
2006-04-05T05:03:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	hrmm, interesting... unrar installs unrar-nonfree automatically now.
2006-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	use 'xv' as the video output
2006-04-09T12:17:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	frostwire is good
2006-04-09T12:18:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	i just want to download the new benny benassi song :P
2006-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	you know any p2p prgm i can install via apt?
2006-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	I've heard gtk-gnutella is good
2006-04-09T12:38:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	when i start frostwire it just sorta loads ad then closes?
2006-04-09T12:39:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	what does it say if you run 'frostwire' froma  terminal ?
2006-04-09T12:40:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	you have to fix it, ubotu told you how.  let me know if it isn't clear
2006-04-09T12:40:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	u did.. i installed the .deb package and now it wont run :P
2006-04-09T12:44:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	seems i need JSE1.4.X -- OOPS, you don't seem to have a valid JRE. FrostWire works best with Sun JRE available at http://www.java.com
2006-04-09T12:46:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	that restricted thing rox ! thx :P
2006-04-09T12:46:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	!javadebs is an easier way of getting the sun java by the way
2006-04-09T12:51:00.000Z	_harm	_jason	just enter !javadebs into terminal?
2006-04-09T12:51:00.000Z	_jason	_harm	/msg ubotu javadebs
