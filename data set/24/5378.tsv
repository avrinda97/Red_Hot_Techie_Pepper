2006-11-26T16:15:00.000Z	h00t		hello i just installed wine .... and i don't see anything in the menu ... how do i use it
2006-11-26T16:15:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	wine "/path/to/whatever.exe"
2006-11-26T16:16:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	is there no front end
2006-11-26T16:17:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	don't think so. I have never used one. I know you can do winecfg and there is a nice little graphical configuration thing, but generally the wine whatever.exe is used to launch things. I think also that you can just double click exes or right click open with wine, not certain on that though
2006-11-29T09:55:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	when i go this site http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/test.html   ... the media that should play doesn't
2006-11-29T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	they all don't work or some don;t?
2006-11-29T09:56:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	type about:plugins into the address bar, see what it has listed
2006-11-29T09:58:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	only java, flash & shockwave  ... but i swear it's checked in add/remove dialog
2006-11-29T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	open a terminal, and do sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer, see what it says
2006-11-29T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	what did it output when you did sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer?
2006-11-29T10:01:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	0 new installed ... i already got it
2006-11-29T10:01:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins, see if it is in there
2006-11-29T10:03:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	there are buncha files in pluging directory and lot of them have mplayer-blabalb.*
2006-11-29T10:03:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	so i guess it's there
2006-11-29T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	that is odd. You don't have two firefoxes do you. Maybe used one of those scripts that installed the latest firefox or the official firefox as opposed to the ubuntu one
2006-11-29T10:05:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	aha, you may need to mv the files into wherever that ff2 directory is. I assume it is in /opt
2006-11-29T10:06:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	try cd /opt/firefox/plugins, I bet that is where the script installed it
2006-11-29T10:06:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	how do i start a root version of the filesystem explorere
2006-11-29T10:10:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	did you figure it out?
2006-11-29T10:12:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	do you know what's the name of the gui filebrowser i want to start it in root
2006-11-29T10:13:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	gksudo nautilus, if you copy and paste the following command, it should all work though, sudo ln -s /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/mplayerplug* /opt/firefox/plugins/
2006-11-29T10:18:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	it works  ... thank you thank you
2006-11-29T10:19:00.000Z	h00t	bruenig	it was the automatix ... i will never use it againa
2006-11-29T10:19:00.000Z	bruenig	h00t	that is why we have this fun factoid
