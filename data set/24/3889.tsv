2007-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: wasn't there recently an article on how automatix can potentially destroy your system?
2007-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	I didnt' read it and I've had good success with it so far
2007-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	if you have a link to that article I would liek to read it since I installed a few hundred megs of stuff through it
2007-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: it would take a while to find, it was on digg. I do recall that there was a follow up article stating that it was only destructive in really rare circumstances. I'm sorry but I don't have time to scour digg for it, as I need to resolve these problems so I can do coursework.
2007-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	it's kewl man...I think I'll be ok...running a new dell m90 and everything seems to work out of the box considering dell is behind the os
2007-09-19T07:00:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	what was your issue?
2007-09-19T07:03:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	could you force a reinstall of synaptic from the command line with apt-get ? isn't there a force switch?
2007-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	it's quite a long story. apparently clamav and vmware had a corrupted install. I'm trying to uninstall them, either by doing a correct install and then uninstalling or uninstalling as is. If I try to get into synaptic I am told to run dpkg --configure -a. I am then asked if I would like to overwrite vmware files. after saying yes to all I get an error message for clamav and vmware dependencies. I have tried restarting my compute
2007-09-19T07:06:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	have you tried the remove option or reinstall option with aptitude?
2007-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: yes, I have. for the past 3 hours I've been going in circles.
2007-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	well if it was me and I ran out of options...I would see if I if i could figure out how to edit the package database and remove the entries for the problem apps and see if you could just try again
2007-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: not sure how to do that
2007-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	neither do I give me a minute and let's see if we can figure out how to do something dangerous
2007-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	I don't mean to sound redundant bu tI jsut found this along the way: sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: and what is that going to do?
2007-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	well I forgot to specify the last argument [the package name]  ... basically it says no really...remove it...I don't care what you have to do...just get it out of there...
2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	I found it here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=481608
2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	if you want me to find other more difficult ways I'll keep searching
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: I'm amd 64, should that matter?
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	I don't think so...
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	but I really have n oidea
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: ok. I'll try it in a few mins when I've finished with something and sent it. thanks for the help.
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	jpastore	thinman1189	let me know if it works...
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	thinman1189	jpastore	: ok
