2006-07-09T14:38:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	your disk might not have been burnt properly
2006-07-09T14:41:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	when you booting from the disk, theres a boot option
2006-07-09T14:41:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	you are booting from a disk, right?
2006-07-09T14:42:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	you are booting from a disk right?
2006-07-09T14:43:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	yeah. when you burn disks, make sure to have the burning program check them at the end, also, burn the disk at the slowest speed possible
2006-07-09T14:43:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	the disk wont work if there are any errors on it
2006-07-09T14:44:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	yeah
2006-07-09T14:45:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	when you boot from the cd, theres that list, including safe graphics mode. one of the options is something like "check CD"
2006-07-09T14:45:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	so your program reads whats going on to you?
2006-07-09T14:45:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	yep
2006-07-09T14:46:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	if it doesnt, then you KNOW the disk is bad
2006-07-09T14:46:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	does it read out the names?
2006-07-09T14:47:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	what?
2006-07-09T14:47:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	that doesnt matter, something may be wrong somewhere else on the disk
2006-07-09T14:47:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	do verify disk
2006-07-09T14:49:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	good luck :)
2006-07-09T14:49:00.000Z	raptros-v76	BlindTech	cool. does it read of the names?
