2011-10-16T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zzecool	its a different hardware, maybe its the driver for the inbuilt keyboard, maybe the keyboard is faulty
2011-10-16T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zzecool	its called 'isolating the issue'
2011-10-16T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zzecool	you haven't tested it yet'
