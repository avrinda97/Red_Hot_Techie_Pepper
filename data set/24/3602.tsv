2007-12-10T17:55:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	that was for you
2007-12-10T17:56:00.000Z	StrictProduction	ikonia	yeah sure ? :)) it is linux everything it is gcc  and source :D
2007-12-10T17:56:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	yes, I'm certain
2007-12-10T17:56:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	nvidia is a closed source driver, and there is no new ubuntu released kernel
2007-12-10T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	would you care to expand your question ?
2007-12-10T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	that is nothing to do with ubuntu, please take this to a more appropriate place
2007-12-10T18:12:00.000Z	StrictProduction	ikonia	antisocialism in here ? rasism ? inhuman language ?
2007-12-10T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	pardon ?
2007-12-10T18:12:00.000Z	StrictProduction	ikonia	it is restricted to me to talk to other users ?
2007-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	on non-ubuntu topics, yes
2007-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	this is an ubuntu support channel only
2007-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	not a chat channel
2007-12-10T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	not ubuntu+1
2007-12-10T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	ubuntu-offtopic for non-ubuntu chatter
2007-12-10T18:15:00.000Z	StrictProduction	ikonia	looks you are paid to say that
2007-12-10T18:15:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	I'm not paid at all, I'm directing you to the correct place
2007-12-10T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	I've no idea if it's even installed in that package
2007-12-10T18:18:00.000Z	StrictProduction	ikonia	then shut up with commenting without searching info
2007-12-10T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	no, not knowing anything about a specific package of a product I don't use
2007-12-10T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	I didn't comment on his problem
2007-12-10T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	and be respectful towards people, that attitude is uncalled for
2007-12-10T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	StrictProduction	hardy disscussion is in #ubuntu+1
