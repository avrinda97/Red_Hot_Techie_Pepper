2007-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	yokobr		hi
2007-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	yokobr		please
2007-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	yokobr		im in trouble
2007-07-03T13:39:00.000Z	yokobr		ok.
2007-07-03T13:40:00.000Z	yokobr		I'm trying to repair a broken package, samba, but i cant. It returns error 102
2007-07-03T13:40:00.000Z	yokobr		I cant update it or even uninstall it
2007-07-03T13:41:00.000Z	yokobr		but i need to repair it to upgrade my ubuntu
2007-07-03T13:41:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	from console, 'sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives' and 'sudo rm /var/cache/apt/partial'  then 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade wine"
2007-07-03T13:42:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	then do what I said, substituting samba for wine.
2007-07-03T13:49:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	and you did all the steps I proposed?
2007-07-03T13:51:00.000Z	yokobr	macd	yes, but i dont have the partial folder
2007-07-03T13:52:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	okay, 'sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/' then 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'  and can I assume this is edgy? or an non upgraded feisty?
2007-07-03T13:56:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	dont remove the directory, only the contents
2007-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	'sudo mkdir /var/cache/apt/archives/
2007-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	'sudo mkdir /var/cache/apt/archives/ and
2007-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	'sudo mkdir /var/cache/apt/archives/partial
2007-07-03T14:02:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	okay, let me know how that goes
2007-07-03T14:02:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	ahhhh
2007-07-03T14:03:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	hopefully that will not happen this time
2007-07-03T14:05:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	it still hangs on the same thing?
2007-07-03T14:08:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	you can also try to use dpkg and force that specific package its hanging on, then rerun the dist upgrade.
2007-07-03T14:12:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	you should 'sudo apt-get remove samba' then start the dist-upgrade over then.
2007-07-03T14:14:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	you have to delete the package from /var/cache/archives/ or ../partial first.
2007-07-03T14:15:00.000Z	macd	yokobr	and I have to get out of here, so good luck
