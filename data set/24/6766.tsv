2005-09-30T14:45:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Are you trying to access a folder on a Linux machine from a Windows one?
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	You need to get samba
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Okay.
2005-09-30T14:46:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Try the username/password of a user on the hosting computer ?
2005-09-30T14:47:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	*Nothing* happens?
2005-09-30T14:47:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	You're working from the Windows machine, right?
2005-09-30T14:48:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	How are you going about connecting to the share?
2005-09-30T14:50:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	You're trying to access a share hosted on a Windows machine from a Linux one?
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Okay.
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	So how are you trying to access the share once you have it set up?
2005-09-30T14:51:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Or is it asking for a password when you click "Share Folder" ?
2005-09-30T14:53:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	I would expect that you would have to punch in the username/password that you use on the Linux box.
2005-09-30T14:54:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Try the username/password that you use on the Windows machine, maybe?
2005-09-30T14:55:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	I assume you've checked that the machines are talking to one another?
2005-09-30T14:57:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Okay.
2005-09-30T14:57:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	That's a good sign.
2005-09-30T14:58:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	And you have Samba server set up, right? Not NFS.
2005-09-30T14:59:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	You would be able to access the Windows machine even without the samba server.
2005-09-30T15:00:00.000Z	Orborde	DualCore	Not sure what to tell you. Sorry. Try looking up smb.conf
