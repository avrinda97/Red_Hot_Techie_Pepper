2007-04-21T08:09:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	LjL what's the problem?
2007-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	are you using python 2.5?
2007-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	i think, one sec
2007-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	2.5 but not -dev.  grabbing -dev.
2007-04-21T08:19:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	yes in coral/makefile.swig, SWIGBIN = swig -classic
2007-04-21T08:19:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	ahh
2007-04-21T08:22:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	I also use that
2007-04-21T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	LjL did you come across "no pyuic found" ?
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	no I havent seen that before, can you paste the output from make?
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	it's an error when i ran where the make script was failling (pyuic_wrapper)_ now i run pyuic_wrapper and i get a valid file, no error
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	compiling as we speak
2007-04-21T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	i installed 3 packages that came up on apt-cache search pyuic
2007-04-21T08:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	but i get a different error now :\
2007-04-21T08:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	type this to get farther.  "sudo apt-get install pyqt-tools python-kde3-dev pyqt4-dev-tools"
2007-04-21T08:31:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	then type "make clean" and "make"
2007-04-21T08:32:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	compiling
2007-04-21T08:35:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	it leaves me with the python errors
2007-04-21T08:36:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	same here
2007-04-21T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	i think it needs libcoral
2007-04-21T08:38:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	it says coral module not found
2007-04-21T08:40:00.000Z	pjesi	xtknight	everything should be in that archive
2007-04-21T08:40:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	yeah the script seems to be installing libcoral improperly, though
2007-04-21T08:44:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	sorry guess i'm not really sure iether
2007-04-21T08:44:00.000Z	xtknight	pjesi	if you need it i'd "alien" the fedora package, bad idea but w/e
