2008-01-15T12:38:00.000Z	vontux		anyone in here ever backup a partition with partimage before?
2008-01-15T12:38:00.000Z	vontux		actually
2008-01-15T12:39:00.000Z	vontux		I should be asking anyone ever backup their whole OS using partimage and then restore?
2008-01-15T12:39:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	I've attempted and failed. Well the backup went ok, the restore didn't.
2008-01-15T12:39:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	did it happen to fail when you tried to boot the newly restore partition?
2008-01-15T12:40:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	no, it refused to read the file that I had backed up correctly
2008-01-15T12:40:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	did you have the gzip compression option set?
2008-01-15T12:40:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	yes

2008-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	apparantly there is something wrong with restoring from gzip compressed image files with partimage
2008-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	vontux		but uncompressed it is supposed to restore fine
2008-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	yeah... it doesn't work
2008-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	vontux		anyone else restore / backup a system using partimage?
2008-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	what restoring with the compression level set to none?
2008-01-15T12:43:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	if you look hard enough, you can understand what partimage does and simply use dd piped to gzip or the compression program of your choice for a backup
2008-01-15T12:43:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	so an image file raw won't restore?
2008-01-15T12:44:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	I don't really know. I just ended up backing up only the important files.
2008-01-15T12:44:00.000Z	vontux		ah
2008-01-15T12:47:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	I've been playing with Bacula... Seems like a better way to go... back up all computers on home network.
2008-01-15T12:48:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	and you have tried restore too?
2008-01-15T12:48:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	not with it, but there is good documentation

2008-01-15T12:50:00.000Z	nibsa1242	vontux	anyhow, I have to goto bed I've spend all day fixing my /boot partition (it got formatted) and sleep is calling me. Good luck with your backup.
2008-01-15T12:50:00.000Z	vontux	nibsa1242	thx
