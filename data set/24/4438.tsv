2007-04-15T09:08:00.000Z	solifugus		Is there no bigger software repository for ubuntu somewhere?
2007-04-15T09:08:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	Bigger than what?
2007-04-15T09:09:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	well it seems tiny.. it has only a short list of like default kde games and such.. for games.. for example... no lyx.. no many things..
2007-04-15T09:09:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	It seems that you might not have turned on all repositories, I show lyx in my list.
2007-04-15T09:10:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	how do you turn them on.. cause yeah... i see very little software.... only extremely core stuff..
2007-04-15T09:10:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	Go into Administration -> Software Sources
2007-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	I see System -> Adept Manager Manager Software Packages... presume that's it
2007-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	I'm guessing that you're running Dapper?
2007-04-15T09:12:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	I just downloaded what i think was the latest kubuntu
2007-04-15T09:13:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	So, is that 7.04?
2007-04-15T09:13:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	how can i check for that?
2007-04-15T09:14:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	Hmm, I'm trying to remember the command :)
2007-04-15T09:14:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	System -> About Ubuntu shows my version.
2007-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	and vox754: it says Edgy
2007-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	and vox754: I see nothing in the Adept package manager that isn't checked or any way to specify additional package repositories....
2007-04-15T09:17:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	The repositories are "main", "universe" and "multiverse"
2007-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	ok.. where can I see/set thoughs?
2007-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	I don't know what the gui solution is for you under kubuntu.
2007-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	I'm googling for you :)
2007-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	well... I am reading throught he man page for aptitude
2007-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	Well, the sources list is in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-04-15T09:22:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	thanks.. that file seems to have things i can uncomment to get "edgy universe" packages...
2007-04-15T09:23:00.000Z	owh	solifugus	Excellent. I wasn't sure if they were there or not.
2007-04-15T09:24:00.000Z	solifugus	owh	aptitude update is now taking a long time.. so i think it's getting a lot more package info.. this might do it..
