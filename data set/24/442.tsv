2012-09-22T22:26:00.000Z	grimeton		are there any special changes made to the lts kernel?
2012-09-22T22:26:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	Changes regarding what exactly?
2012-09-22T22:27:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	block devices
2012-09-22T22:27:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	Do you have a specific problem with them using Ubuntu?
2012-09-22T22:28:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	windows 7 x64 in virtualbox on ubuntu 12.04 lts http://imgur.com/vLpQL
2012-09-22T22:29:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	Windows progress bars always lie, especially when copying very small files.
2012-09-22T22:29:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	yeah, especially when you wait for 30 minutes already ...
2012-09-22T22:30:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	i already removed barriers and stuff, but no change
2012-09-22T22:30:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	Then take a look at the I/O on your host. Blame it on windows ;)
2012-09-22T22:30:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	same hardware, other distro, and the vms start to fly
2012-09-22T22:30:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	so imho, it can only be something in the chain from vbox to the harddrives
2012-09-22T22:31:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	In that case, all Ubuntu hosts should have that problem, which they dont.
2012-09-22T22:31:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	so how does that answer help me now?
2012-09-22T22:32:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	http://imgur.com/Mo2eT
2012-09-22T22:32:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	The answer helps you in that way, that you know that it isnt a general Ubuntu problem.
2012-09-22T22:32:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	yeah, it has to be something different ...
2012-09-22T22:35:00.000Z	bekks	grimeton	Have you checked the max. throughput of your disks in Ubuntu? Have you checked the throughput of a VM when just using a livecd in a VM and doing the same tests as on your host?
2012-09-22T22:36:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	i don't need to test that, to see that it is slow with ubuntu 12.04 lts
2012-09-22T22:37:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	...
2012-09-22T22:43:00.000Z	grimeton	bekks	the first copy process errored out with an unspecific error ... osom...
