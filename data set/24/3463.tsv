2009-04-11T06:44:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	I have sendmail, that is an incoming mail server as well right?
2009-04-11T06:45:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	And I could use Alpine to check the incoming mail?
2009-04-11T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	i guess, its not something ive used but i know mutt can be used to check mail in ssh
2010-05-11T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	add the folder to $PATH
2010-05-11T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder

2010-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	not if you only install transmission-daemon and transmission-cli

2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	I got a Droid i want to set that up on
2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	I use transdroid. Its awesome
2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	fantastic, i will look into this :D
2010-08-31T03:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	sure, theres a section in the config to setup the proxy
2010-08-31T03:49:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	right, but i read somewhere that it is only for the initial connection, and that after that it doesn;t use the proxy for actual peer connections
2010-08-31T03:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Wavesonics	you can set http_proxy and ftp_proxy   to make it use the proxy
2010-08-31T03:51:00.000Z	Wavesonics	ActionParsnip	ah it uses ftp for the peer to peer and http for the tracker?
