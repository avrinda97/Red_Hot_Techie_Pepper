2011-05-15T00:06:00.000Z	sik		I uninstalled SCIM now (apt-get remove, etc.) but that didn't seem to get Ubuntu to, um, not send me back to the log in screen...
2011-05-15T00:06:00.000Z	sik		So now I don't know if it was SCIM or some update
2011-05-15T00:06:00.000Z	Oerg866	sik	did that fix it? in any case disregard my emails >.>
2011-05-15T00:07:00.000Z	sik	Oerg866	nope :(

2011-05-15T00:07:00.000Z	Oerg866		Cant you run the keyboard config setup thing again?
2011-05-15T00:07:00.000Z	sik		I ran dpkg but nothing... Also when I had installed SCIM it uninstalled something so I want to reinstall whatever got removed again
2011-05-15T00:07:00.000Z	Oerg866		I havent installed ubuntu in ages but there was something that let you do that
2011-05-15T00:09:00.000Z	sik		OK, so: does anybody know how to restore the old keyboard setup? And how can I find out what's making Ubuntu send me back to the log in screen? Even in safe mode it happens :(
