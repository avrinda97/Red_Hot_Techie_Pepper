2004-10-30T06:53:00.000Z	tolstoy		Arrrrrrrgggggghhhhh!
2004-10-30T06:53:00.000Z	tolstoy		I wish packages in universe would actually be there!
2004-10-30T06:54:00.000Z	tolstoy		sbcl from debian requires a version of common-lisp-controller > ubuntu's version.
2004-10-30T06:56:00.000Z	tolstoy		with rpm, you could at least rpmbuild -ta tarfile.tgz and have something you can install.
2004-10-30T06:57:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	you can use checkinstall
2004-10-30T07:00:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	what about the stuff in http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/s/sbcl/.  Can I use that to make a deb?
2004-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	looks like it... 
2004-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	it looks like you can download that stuff, apply the patch, and go from tehre
2004-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	however, i'm a debian n00b and dont' know how to create .debs other than using checkinstall
2004-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	is that .dsc file the deb control file?
2004-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	don't know
2004-10-30T07:04:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	I've seen one of 'em, but it seemed to require you to be familiar with the project you're debbing up. ;)
2004-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	there are two packages you'll probably want: devscripts and fakeroot
2004-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	okay, while sbcl is building, I'll see if I can apt'em.
2004-10-30T07:18:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	maybe that's why it isn't in universe... =)
2004-10-30T07:18:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	I suspect as much.
2004-10-30T07:37:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	I think they took that out of nautilus in current (2.6, 2.8) versions.
2004-10-30T07:38:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	dooooh!!!
2004-10-30T07:40:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	with scripts
2004-10-30T07:40:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	i don't know specifically about ubuntu, but when i was an rpm maintainer for a project, we had a build machien with different roots that you just dumped your srpm into and it compiled them for you
2004-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	so you might have a problem if the gcc on that machine couldn't compile the gcc srpm, eh?
2004-10-30T07:42:00.000Z	aitrus	tolstoy	well, actually, with gcc you can compile cross compile
2004-10-30T08:29:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	checkinstall you say?  Hm.
2004-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	tolstoy	aitrus	I bet sbcl (common lisp) is too freaky for this to work, but I'm going to try it anyway.
