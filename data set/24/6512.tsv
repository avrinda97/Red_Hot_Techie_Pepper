2005-11-04T17:15:00.000Z	rohal		how should i remove enlightenment from my system??
2005-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	ap-get remove enlightenment
2005-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	its not doing ...i want to remove everything installed for enlightenment
2005-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	libs & all
2005-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	my only advice then is to search through synaptic
2005-11-04T17:17:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	and remove everything you see
2005-11-04T17:17:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	if thats all you did, then removing enlightenment using "remove" should suffice
2005-11-04T17:18:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	should only have enlightenment and enlightenment-data installed
2005-11-04T17:18:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	if i remember correctly
2005-11-04T17:20:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	did that help at all?
2005-11-04T17:21:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	yea a little bit....i am still confused whether i have removed everything or not...
2005-11-04T17:21:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	actually i want to install e17......
2005-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	are you installing from a repository or compiling by hand?
2005-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	repository ofcource...i am not a geek to fix those errors during compilation...
2005-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	did you use this guide? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79155
2005-11-04T17:25:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	are you on warty?
2005-11-04T17:25:00.000Z	rohal	jesse_	warty means??
2005-11-04T17:25:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	your version of ubuntu ... 4.10, 5.04, or 5.10?
2005-11-04T17:26:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	yeah, you just need to get the key
2005-11-04T17:26:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	in my link, it tells how to get and load the key

2005-11-04T17:28:00.000Z	jesse_	rohal	cool, do you need any further help with removing/installing e17? or are you good?
