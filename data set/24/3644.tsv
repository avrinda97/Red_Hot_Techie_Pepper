2007-11-29T09:11:00.000Z	goat		anyone familiar with pam.d?   http://pastebin.com/d90b561f   this is /etc/pam.d/common-password   which (I believe) ubuntu uses to check login creds....    following some instructions for LDAP client setup,  I used auth-client-config to change it...  is there something wrong with this code?  anyone familiar with pam?
2007-11-29T09:12:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	I setup sambaldap a few times using pam.d
2007-11-29T09:12:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	you want samble files
2007-11-29T09:12:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	I'm getting denied on my (correct) password ever since loading that...  I'm going to try putting it back,  but do you think that syntax is correct
2007-11-29T09:13:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	I'm trying to make ubuntu a part of an AD network at work (if all works out)
2007-11-29T09:13:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	?  I think I missed the syntax

2007-11-29T09:14:00.000Z	vile_maxim		o
2007-11-29T09:14:00.000Z	goat		!mount
2007-11-29T09:15:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	it looks ok to me, but mine is a little different
2007-11-29T09:15:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	if you look on line 24, thats what used to be there
2007-11-29T09:16:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	the only difference is that obscure is not listed
2007-11-29T09:16:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	which shouldn't be a probelm right?
2007-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	I got mine working from following how-to... so my understanding is limited... but my home network is running with ldap.
2007-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	can you point me to one that you used?
2007-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	my  common-password     password   sufficient pam_ldap.so md5         password   required   pam_unix.so md5 try_first_pass
2007-11-29T09:17:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	sure... let me dig it up
2007-11-29T09:18:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	 was written for debian sarge, but it works for debian etch    http://nomis52.net/?section=docs&page=samldap
2007-11-29T09:18:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	I'm going to try following your basic syntax,  thansk for your help
2007-11-29T09:19:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	I had to change a lot of pam files... not just that one.. so your problem maybe elsewhere
2007-11-29T09:19:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	that howto should sort it out though
2007-11-29T09:20:00.000Z	goat	vile_maxim	i will look at that too, thanks
2007-11-29T09:20:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	the nsswitch.conf is what has given me problems in the past.
2007-11-29T09:22:00.000Z	vile_maxim	goat	I'll me on line for a while longer... I'll be happy to give you sample files if you need them....
