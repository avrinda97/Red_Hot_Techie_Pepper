2012-05-18T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	prc384	did you run any commands related to group membership...?
2012-05-18T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	prc384	you shouldn't be in the root group

2012-05-18T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	prc384	why don't you answer my question?
2012-05-18T19:18:00.000Z	jrib	prc384	what is the output of « mount ».  Namely, is / mounted ro?
