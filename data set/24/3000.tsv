2008-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		ive just downloaded the server install ubuntu 8.04 and would like to do a text only install, doI need to boot to the live environment? Can anyone please advise
2008-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		or do I need the alternative ISO?
2008-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	no you dont
2008-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	how do i kick off the text install please?
2008-05-29T15:40:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	when you turn the cd in. it asks you for language. in this option can you set install method to ext mode..
2008-05-29T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	so its in the language list?
2008-05-29T15:41:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	wait i try it shortly
2008-05-29T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	appreciate it man
2008-05-29T15:45:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	AccessExcess, ok it tested it on my other computer. Looks like there is no text mode. But you can say Install Ubuntu and it won't load the whole live-cd environment
2008-05-29T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	cheers man :P
2008-05-29T15:45:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	 when you got a problem with your graphic card you can hit f4 and set to save graphics mode
2008-05-29T15:46:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	you are welcome..damned your nick is driving me insane!
2008-05-29T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	i want a barebones system to run a samba server, so I dont want all the extra fluff that comes with a vanilla install
2008-05-29T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	why?
2008-05-29T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	just tab autocomplete it :)
2008-05-29T15:46:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	ok but why don't you use debian instead
2008-05-29T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	pretty much the same deal when i'm down to it, i dont want an x server
2008-05-29T15:48:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	yes thats what i mean. you cannot install only the basic (debian) system only with console vi and cat =).
2008-05-29T15:48:00.000Z	patric_	ActionParsnip	you can! but just not with the ubuntu 8.04 dvd.
2008-05-29T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	patric_	you can with alternate cd, theres an install server version which installs a minimal rig to command line
