2012-04-25T22:36:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		lovely
2012-04-25T22:36:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		imo still not a big fan of the new UI
2012-04-25T22:37:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		luckily there's gnome fallback session
2012-04-25T22:38:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		although not as equipped as gnome and it still has some flaws, i can live with it at the moment
2012-04-25T22:38:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		resource wise im not too worried
2012-04-25T22:38:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		(16GB ram)
2012-04-25T22:38:00.000Z	throwaway_rq		and it's win7
2012-04-25T22:39:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	so you are running ubuntu in a VM ?
2012-04-25T22:39:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	for the moment yes, i still game on win7, so i can't always run full *nix
2012-04-25T22:40:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	haha I see, thats what I have my 360 for ( only windows machine I actually ever liked ) :-)
2012-04-25T22:40:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	haha. agreed.
2012-04-25T22:44:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	I was gonna build a $1500 gaming machine with nvidia 680's but I decided to just wait for xbox 720 in 2013 since im happy with my 360 and im sure it will be cheaper. Now back on topic for me :-P
2012-04-25T22:44:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	problem is, i can't do fps right on a console, unless u give me a mouse and keyboard
2012-04-25T22:45:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	I see im the exact opposite I like it better with a controller, using mouse+kb to game gives me cramped wrists pretty quickly.
2012-04-25T22:45:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	some games i do agree that conrollers are much better, but for the games i play (mostly fps) mouse just gives me a lot more agility
2012-04-25T22:48:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	q9550 thats like the king of core 2 duo right?
2012-04-25T22:48:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	QX9650
2012-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	yes
2012-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	not bad
2012-04-25T22:50:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	throwaway_rq	i3 550 3.2ghz oc to 4.2 ( non stock cooler ) runs very cool too. 4gb ram. 40gb intel ssd. just a $600 build from a few years ago ;-)
2012-04-25T22:51:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	InferiorHumanOrg	i kinda kick myself sometimes cuz i dont even play 3d games as much as i did 10 yeras go
