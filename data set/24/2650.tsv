2008-10-05T07:34:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	any ideas?
2008-10-05T07:38:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	 sudo ifdown eth0 ;sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.254.254 up     both boxes  but change the last 254 to 253 on one.    then you will probably want to     sudo route add default gw 192.168.254.25?   <<<< ip of which ever is connected to the inet.  on the other box.
2008-10-05T07:39:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	explain that last bit .. route add????
2008-10-05T07:39:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i dont want to share internet.. i just want to quickly transfer files from the old box to the new one.. im getting rid of the old one..
2008-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	if you want to share the inet connection two things need to be in place.   on the box that will be the gateway, you need ipv4_forwarding enabled in /etc/sysctl.conf    and on the non-gateway.  you need to tell it where the "default gateway" is.  sudo route add default gw <ip_here>
2008-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i DONT want to share internet. i JUST want to copy files from old hd/box to new one quickly.
2008-10-05T07:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	then ignore the las part of that.  and just down/up the interfaces.
2008-10-05T07:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	  from ?
2008-10-05T07:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	  ping <ip_of_other_box>   ?
2008-10-05T07:43:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i set one box nic to ip .......1 and i set another to ip........2 both with netmask 255.255.255.252... and then i go ping one from the other, and it says network unrechable
2008-10-05T07:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	netmask too long.
2008-10-05T07:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	netmask 255.255.0.0
2008-10-05T07:44:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	netmask 255.255.255.0    at the most.
2008-10-05T07:44:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	but it worked fine with this one an hour ago?
2008-10-05T07:46:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i set them -------- ip 10.0.1.1, netmask 255.255.0.0 .... and ip 10.0.1.2 netmask 255.255.0.0.... now it says ping... "destination host unreachable"...
2008-10-05T07:48:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	you say it is a crossover cat5 ?   checked the connection both ends ?
2008-10-05T07:50:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	both ends secure. green light on. brand new crossover cat 5. worked an hour ago
2008-10-05T08:06:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	how many net ifaces does box have ?
2008-10-05T08:06:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i have wireless and also ethernet on each, at least.
2008-10-05T08:07:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	just for kicks you might ifconfig down the wireless on both and then ping.
2008-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx2	Agent_bob	i took the wireless adapter out of the source computer.
2008-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	Agent_bob	xjohnthomasx2	.
