2006-11-14T08:22:00.000Z	compengi		temperature*
2006-11-14T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	I get the best results with mbmon. It's kernel- and ACPI-independent.
2006-11-14T08:25:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	which one the x-mbmon or mbmon?
2006-11-14T08:25:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	you definitely need mbmon. xmbmon is optional
2006-11-14T08:27:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	how to run it?
2006-11-14T08:27:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	'sudo mbmon'
2006-11-14T08:28:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	is x-mbmon gui?
2006-12-08T07:16:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	there are a few of them, why?
2006-12-08T07:18:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	cause yesterday i made a post it said that it won't be in the forums before a moderator checks it
2006-12-08T07:18:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	and it's not in the forums till now
2006-12-08T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	I see, you mean ubuntuforums. Sorry, I guess you have to be patient still
2006-12-08T07:19:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	is any of the moderators online now?
2006-12-08T07:19:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	I don't know. Sorry, I thought you meant channel moderators.
2006-12-10T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	yes
2007-04-18T12:06:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	gunzip is the default tool to extract .gz files
2007-04-18T12:07:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	even if you run some gui program, it'll use gunzip in the background
2007-04-18T12:10:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	but what happened is that i extracted the file.gz using GUI tool and copied it to a specific folder but the program after running didn't recognize that file, while when i used gunzip -c winamp_presets.gz > ~/.xmms/eq.preset it worked
2007-04-18T12:11:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	the difference is the invocation. Your gui prog will have uncompressed it to winamp_presets, not to the target name you specified.
2007-04-18T12:12:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	nope.. it extracted it to eq.preset
2007-09-28T14:13:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	what what? Shift-Alt-Fx isn't the right combination.
2007-09-28T14:13:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	sorry, didn't mean you
2008-08-14T19:44:00.000Z	soundray	compengi	what have you changed since it worked?
2008-08-14T19:44:00.000Z	compengi	soundray	i didn't change anything. i was just browsing normaly
