2011-08-09T23:33:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	well as you can tell there it is :P
2011-08-09T23:34:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	ok you are trying to install then. what iso did you download
2011-08-09T23:34:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	the one off the site, ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso
2011-08-09T23:35:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	did you check the md5sums?
2011-08-09T23:35:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	thanks was about to ask haha
2011-08-09T23:35:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	and is your system in fact 64bit
2011-08-09T23:36:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	yes i have a 64 bit processor, and i was running the same iso using WUBI before but decided to do it the official way
2011-08-09T23:37:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	can you test that disk on another computer just in case it got burned wrong
2011-08-09T23:42:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	: yea im trying to use it on another computer but its an old ibm and i cant figure out its bios XD is there someother way i can tell ?
2011-08-09T23:43:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	the older system probably isn't 64bit anyways
2011-08-09T23:44:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	usually in this situation one would suspect the install media is corrupted. you can boot your wubi and take an md5sum of /dev/dvd or /dev/cdrom to see if it burned correctly. if it did burn correctly you could try the alternate installer
2011-08-09T23:45:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	and do you think it would help to redo the setup of the usb? or reinstalling the iso ?
2011-08-09T23:45:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	text mode installer. it might not have the same problems
2011-08-09T23:45:00.000Z	noneabove_	escott	where do i learn about that ?
2011-08-09T23:46:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	ok so this is a usb. you might try a cd in case your bios doesnt like usb boots. what kind of computer is this?
2011-08-09T23:47:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	the alternate installer you can download from ubuntu.com
2011-08-09T23:47:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	is that an efi system?
2011-08-09T23:48:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	does the bios support your mouse
2011-08-09T23:50:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	i would start by making a cd if you have a blank cdr around. i dont know of any issues getting dv6's to boot with the installer, but perhaps there are some
2011-08-09T23:52:00.000Z	escott	noneabove_	i guess try the alternate iso. you can make a usb stick with the same usb-creator-gtk
