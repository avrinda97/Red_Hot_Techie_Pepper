2007-10-12T15:11:00.000Z	neverblue2		I want to speak with someone about turning monitors on and off, its complicated, whose up for the task ?
2007-10-12T15:13:00.000Z	neverblue2		ill elaborate when someone is confident enough they can assist
2007-10-12T15:13:00.000Z	neverblue2		as its a long discussion
2007-10-12T15:14:00.000Z	neverblue2		ah, well, heguru and kitche, you just appear to want to rant, rather than help, so please, no need to reply
2007-10-12T15:15:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	let me jump in the rant. i agree. state your question and those who know will help
2007-10-12T15:15:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	you also dont appear to want to help
2007-10-12T15:15:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	on the contrary. i am not willing to sit down for a long period of time and discuss your problem without first knowing if i can even solve it.
2007-10-12T15:15:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	good luck finding volunteers for that
2007-10-12T15:19:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	i have a feeling you could use xset to set the dpms power off to some really low number
2007-10-12T15:20:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	is I was a user on a system, what groups must I be in for me to 'xset dpms force off' ?
2007-10-12T15:22:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	am I asking the wrong person ?
2007-10-12T15:23:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	not sure. i was testing it out ;) you should be able to use xset on the display which belongs to your user. not sure what group you would have to be in to use it on another display. im thinking it will take root
2007-10-12T15:24:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	now if you were to setup a cron to do it, you need to export DISPLAY as well
2007-10-12T15:25:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	oh? you can't use the -display option from xset instead of that shell var?
2007-10-12T15:25:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	try it :)
2007-10-12T15:29:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	any luck ?
2007-10-12T15:33:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	ill see in 2 min if my crontab entry turns off my screen. im just guessing you weren't successful or you wouldn't be asking about it?
2007-10-12T15:33:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	as I said its complicated, but your almost caught up to where I am :)
2007-10-12T15:36:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	ok. my crontab entry works. whats next?
2007-10-12T15:36:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	now xset -q
2007-10-12T15:36:00.000Z	trpr	neverblue2	yes
2007-10-12T15:36:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	xset -dpms
2007-10-12T15:37:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	pm now ?
2007-10-13T16:05:00.000Z	neverblue2	trpr	and I are really giving it a good going over
