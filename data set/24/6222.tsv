2006-03-09T16:07:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	I suppose it's a uid problem
2006-03-09T16:07:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	that could be it.. would you mine expanding a little..
2006-03-09T16:07:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	can you mount it?
2006-03-09T16:07:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	nope, thats the problem
2006-03-09T16:08:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	I'm using breezy to a macosx client.. previously in gentoo I had it working but didnt save my confs and it's been a while since I've done anything with nfs
2006-03-09T16:08:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	mount manually? "mount whateverserver:/media/data-core /mnt/whatever"
2006-03-09T16:09:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	first, check the nfs-server runs with your exports, check the syslog for it
2006-03-09T16:10:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	I don't know mac, but nfs-server writes to log
2006-03-09T16:14:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	Any idea how I turn on the insecure port availability? Think macosx needs to use nfs that way..
2006-03-09T16:15:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	I don't know mac
2006-03-09T16:15:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	Server side I mean.. see in the syslog.. > Mar  4 20:26:31 rendai-netserv kernel: [ 1183.044804]  nfsd: request from insecure port (10.1.1.30:53670)!
2006-03-09T16:16:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	ohh its cool found it..
2006-03-09T16:17:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	kernel option?
2006-03-09T16:18:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	good, so, it's in "man exports"
2006-03-09T16:18:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	Like so: (async,no_subtree_check,rw,insecure)
2006-03-09T16:19:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	it's okay, someone may already knew it
2006-03-09T16:21:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	I wont buy mac, it's getting worms now
2006-03-09T16:22:00.000Z	nandemonai	dli	Yeah I know O_o.. not my machine though so I coudlnt care any less :P
2006-03-09T16:25:00.000Z	dli	nandemonai	when mac goes intel and maxOS ends up with viruses :) time to switch
