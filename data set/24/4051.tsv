2007-09-02T16:05:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	he never got that about the quotes, he he
2007-09-02T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	eh, he turned into a one-liner ;)
2007-10-21T22:28:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	aata strangely, one day before gutsy the channel was to its usual 1090
2007-10-21T22:29:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	yesterday I was the 1337 'th user. Destiny :)
2007-10-21T22:30:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	how?!
2007-10-21T22:30:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	user count. lasted about 3 seconds
2008-01-06T04:13:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	 in other words, they lurk ;p
2008-01-06T04:13:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	YES!
2008-04-06T08:09:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	seriously I felt like that was deja vu, I was expecting nickrud though
2008-04-06T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	heh. found out I had one already, just forgot #ubuntu+1 is handling hardy questions until release,  /j #ubuntu+1
2008-06-22T04:04:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	:)
2008-06-22T04:16:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	the ~i limits the search to installed packages
2008-06-22T04:16:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	is that documented, never read about it. I think aptitude uses regex, but I could be wrong-
2008-06-22T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	it's in the docs, yes. There's all kinds of useful switches, try \!~i~sgnome
2008-06-22T04:18:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	personally I prefer to see all the results of the search, that way I know what else there is
2008-06-22T04:19:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	has many uses, try ~c . That lists the packages you've removed but left the config files. Just a useful tool, that's all
2008-06-22T04:20:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	I do like aptitude, it is great
2008-06-22T04:20:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	apt-get has had purge since... well always
2008-06-22T04:21:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	I tend to use aptitude in interactive mode, and use  l (L) instead of / for searching
2008-06-22T04:21:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	--purge, yes but not purge as in aptitude
2008-06-22T04:21:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	you mean without the --
2008-06-22T04:21:00.000Z	nickrud	vocx	yep
2008-06-22T05:22:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	he was using the ad remove program
2008-06-22T05:23:00.000Z	vocx	nickrud	I meant he selected the programs in a graphical way, so it's not as easy as sudo aptitude install and then list of the packages, just that.
