2007-11-22T11:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	im no expert but whats your problem?
2007-11-22T11:33:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	set up a new computer, and im able to SSH into it and ive set up VNC but i cant connect via VNC
2007-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	where did you set up vnc, does the process start at boot?
2007-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	uh
2007-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	in a terminal: ps -e | grep vnc      see if it gives you any output
2007-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	no output
2007-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	should i vnc4server :1?
2007-11-22T11:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	:0 probably, but i think vnc is generally for a login, my server has a desktop that is always logged in, and i use x11vnc for my vnc server and just have it always running, so i can start things on the desktop and close the window, tehn go back to it whenever
2007-11-22T11:37:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	so what should i run ?>
2007-11-22T11:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	i dont konw exactly, probably just log in as your user, and start the vnc server
2007-11-22T11:39:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	i cant run vnc4server :0
2007-11-22T11:39:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	A VNC server is already running as :0
2007-11-22T11:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	type vnc and hit tab a couple times to see what commands are available, chances are youll figure out which one to use
2007-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	"display all 1936 possibilities?"
2007-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	heh no, u didnt put a space after vnc did u?
2007-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	DM|	shouldnt give you 1900 possibilties lol
2007-11-22T11:40:00.000Z	DM|	MasterShrek	bash: vnc: command not found
