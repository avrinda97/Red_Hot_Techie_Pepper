2009-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	k1en		hi, guys, in 'ifconfig', what is "Bcast", is that like the default gateway in windows?
2009-09-15T09:52:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	it's the LAN broadcast address
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	erm, is that the same as gateway? how do i find the gateway?
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	no, it's different
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	it is used for sending packets to every local host
2009-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	the gateway transmits packets to the outside network
2009-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	i see,   thanks, so how do i find out the gateway address?
2009-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	the broadcast usually ends in .255.  gateways often have .1, but it can be anything from 1 to 254
2009-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	you will usually need to know it already or guess it
2009-09-15T09:57:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	the reason i'm asking is that i have 2 machines, in one of them the gateway changed suddenly to 0.0.0.0. in the other machine for some reason i cannot see anything in "network connection" (althpough i am connected to the internet)
2009-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	what machine are you using as the gateway?
2009-09-15T09:58:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	these two machines are on 2 separtae networks, they are not connected, but both have started to be slugish lately
2009-09-15T09:59:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	so i figure its the same reason (gateway becoming 0.0.0.0)
2009-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	iy may be something else
2009-09-15T10:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	do they use DHCP for configuration?
2009-09-15T10:01:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	yes
2009-09-15T10:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	then they should find the gateways automatically when they attempt dhcp setup
2009-09-15T10:02:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	you know that icon for networking, when i click edit configuration - there is nothing there. what do you call that ? i want to google the problem , but not sure aboput the key words
2009-09-15T10:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	nm-applet
2009-09-15T10:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	it's part of NetworkManager
2009-09-15T10:03:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	great thanks
2009-09-15T10:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	I usually try to avoid using it
2009-09-15T10:04:00.000Z	k1en	lstarnes	so what do you use ?
2009-09-15T10:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	k1en	I usually just let dhcp's dhclient handle it
