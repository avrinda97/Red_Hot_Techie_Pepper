2011-08-03T02:02:00.000Z	Anon1234		Hi, I've got trouble when playing games in fullscreen. The touchpad seems to be too sensitive, compared to when playing in a window
2011-08-03T02:04:00.000Z	Anon1234		No
2011-08-03T02:06:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	OmegaForte: Really, it's not needed in most cases. The system detects on-the-fly most of the settings required.
2011-08-03T02:06:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	that clears my worries :D
2011-08-03T02:07:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	OmegaForte: I have no idea how to do that, but if it's done in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, you can always create it yourself.
2011-08-03T02:11:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Has this got something to do with that? http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7152711&postcount=14
2011-08-03T02:13:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	Oh, that's not it. This is about the pointer being always visible
2011-08-03T02:13:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Ahh... visible, but is it moving?
2011-08-03T02:13:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	It moves too fast here, but only with a touchpad. It ignores the sensitivity
2011-08-03T02:14:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	Yes, but too fast. But when I use a mouse it works great!
2011-08-03T02:14:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Ahh... yes, touchpads are evil. I would just disable them altogether, if I had it my way.
2011-08-03T02:15:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	Unfortunately there's no space to use a mouse on a move. And when you're bored, games are the solution
2011-08-03T02:15:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	There's always IRC, and specifically this channel? :D
2011-08-03T02:16:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	Ah, but I usually have no connection. Otherwise I would hang out here on the move
2011-08-03T02:30:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Sorry, I really have no idea what to look for. Like I said, touchpads are evil. I hate mine, and never use it.
2011-08-03T02:31:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	I'm starting to too. I'll try to get help with a different problem
2011-08-03T02:37:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	No idea what could be going on. What have you recently installed? Maybe take a look at ~/.Xsession-errors. Some people have had problems with Ubuntu One syncs upon login.
2011-08-03T02:39:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	Nothing really. Only switched the battery indicator for something better. And .Xsession-errors seems to not have any errors during startup
2011-08-03T02:40:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Sorry, I'm stumped. Good luck with that!
2011-08-03T02:41:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	I will keep on trying. It seems some people have the same problem, but no solution anywhere
2011-08-03T02:43:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	No! It's still under development!
2011-08-03T02:43:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	Unless you really, really, I MEAN REALLY know what you're doing, don't run it.
2011-08-03T02:44:00.000Z	astraljava	Anon1234	I know, I run them all the time. But oneiric isn't, at this moment.
2011-08-03T02:44:00.000Z	Anon1234	astraljava	I'll wait then
