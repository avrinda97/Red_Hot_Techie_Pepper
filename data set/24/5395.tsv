2009-03-03T04:52:00.000Z	Wildburn		sigh, im beginning to think ubuntu hates my comp
2009-03-03T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	why
2009-03-03T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	I see
2009-03-03T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	yeah and Intrepid Ibex lacks suppourt for old NIvida graphics cards
2009-03-03T04:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	how old is the card?
2009-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	and the propritary drivers installed?
2009-03-03T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	ok  which Ubuntu you on now?
2009-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	ok Ibex probably lacks suppourt for your card
2009-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	and not much difference there
2009-03-03T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	and Hardy is not perfect  with Nivida graphids cards either
2009-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	Ibex lacks suppourt for old cards,  as for hardy I remember when I tried to help a guy get his  Nivda card working (by remote connecting) on an old lap top,  and  we could never get the one from repo or nividas site to work
2009-03-03T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	in the end he put Windows back on that lap top, plus he wanted to run loads of Windows rubbish anyway
2009-03-03T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	well other good   user friendly distros,  I assume you want user friendly
2009-03-03T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	and you can try stuff from Live CD's
2009-03-03T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	ok so something Ubuntu based maybe?
2009-03-03T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	yeah  Fedora Core 2 and 4,  then Ubuntu since second relse for me.    I just installed FC2,  no Live CD testing first or virtualization,  that came later for other distros.   anyway not used it myself, but Crunchbang is meant to be a very good  Ubuntu based distro
2009-03-03T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	yeah it's ashame that Nivida don't have opensource Linux drivers
2009-03-03T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	no, but you could get an offical driver from Nivida for your card, and try that
2009-03-03T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	yes the ones in the repo can be  rubbishey
2009-03-03T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	well  next Ubuntu end of April, and maybe you get more luck there :)
2009-03-03T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	I will upgrade when the beta is out
2009-03-03T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	tinyme?
2009-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	maybe  depends on computer I guess
2009-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Wildburn	well Puppy Linux and such  for old hardware
