2010-01-08T11:08:00.000Z	crabgrass		OH
2010-01-08T11:08:00.000Z	crabgrass		yeah, facestab, that's the one
2010-01-08T11:08:00.000Z	crabgrass		thanks!
2010-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	crabgrass		yeah, i know it's filesystem table, but it looks like face-stab, so that's what i call it
2010-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	crabgrass		plus, non-linux users get a kick out of it
2010-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	crabgrass		especially ones that watch metalpocalypse
2010-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	crabgrass		yeah
2010-01-08T11:09:00.000Z	crabgrass		don't worry about it
2010-01-08T11:10:00.000Z	crabgrass		heh
2010-01-08T11:11:00.000Z	crabgrass		...any pros and cons for mounting via UUID?
2010-01-08T11:11:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	can't think of any cons, it's the default method nowadays
2010-01-08T11:13:00.000Z	crabgrass	jtaji	should have seen that coming. thanks!
2010-01-08T11:16:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	they are based on filesystem path only
2010-01-08T11:17:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	in what context?
2010-01-08T11:18:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	hmm.. well ext3 can be mounted as ext2, ignoring the journal
2010-01-08T11:19:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	yes that's normal for ext3.. it's essentially just ext2 + journal
2010-01-08T11:19:00.000Z	crabgrass	jtaji	but none of the other entries include that.
2010-01-08T11:20:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	ahh.. I wouldn't worry about it
2010-01-08T11:20:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	yes TYPE is the important one
2010-01-08T11:28:00.000Z	crabgrass	jtaji	...concur?
2010-01-08T11:28:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	nope, as long as the target file still exists at the same filesystem path, the link is still functioning
2010-01-08T11:29:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	it's normal to put mount points under /media, not /dev
2010-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	oh sorry I see
2010-01-08T11:30:00.000Z	jtaji	crabgrass	yeah just give it a name
