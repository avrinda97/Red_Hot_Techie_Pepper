2005-07-26T15:24:00.000Z	slask3n		Where is the startup-script located so i can load modules at startup? i want to run "modprobe quickcam" at startup to load my webcam, but i dont know where to find the script, or the syntax of the script.. can anyone please help me?
2005-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	create a text file in /etc/modprobe.d/
2005-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	say u want to load the "modulex', create a text file "module x" in /etc/modprobe.d/
2005-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	slask3n	robotgeek	ok :) but should anything be written in the file?
2005-07-26T15:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	either that /etc/modules ...add ur module to the end
2005-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	slask3n	robotgeek	now ive made a file in /etc/modprobe.d/ and its empty, or should it contain any text? i see the other files there have some text inside...
2005-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	my bad...if you want to alias that module to something, you would add the text "alias modulex more_friendly_name_for_modulex" in the file
2005-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	to just load the module, just add it to /etc/modules
2005-07-26T15:32:00.000Z	slask3n	robotgeek	Ok :) should i delete the file in /etc/modprobe.d/ ?
2005-07-26T15:32:00.000Z	robotgeek	slask3n	yeah
