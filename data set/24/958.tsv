2010-10-06T05:55:00.000Z	ddilinge1		when i ssh into my desktop 10.04 machine, ~/.bashrc is never read which would imply ssh is considered a non-interactive shell .. anyway to have the ~/.bashrc always included when i ssh in(to an interactive shell), but not for shell scripts, etc?
2010-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	ddilinge1		any ideas on the autoloading of ~/.bashrc when ssh'ing in ?
2010-10-06T05:58:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 as in not executing?
2010-10-06T05:59:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 what are you trying to do or not do with .bashrc.
2010-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	when i ssh into my desktop 10.04 machine, ~/.bashrc is never read which would imply ssh is considered a non-interactive shell .. anyway to have the ~/.bashrc always included when i ssh in(to an interactive shell), but not for shell scripts, etc?
2010-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	ps | grep $$ verifies i am using bash
2010-10-06T06:02:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 is /etc/bash.bashrc read?
2010-10-06T06:03:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	not sure, adjusting it for some debug output and let you know in 1 sec
2010-10-06T06:04:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 ssh into my 10.04 and both /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc are running
2010-10-06T06:04:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	/etc/bash.bashrc is running, and it gets past the initial [ -z "$PS1" ] && return check, but all my aliases in ~/.bashrc arnt being loaded
2010-10-06T06:05:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 you tried putting debugs in ~/.bashrc?
2010-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	echo FOOOO is the first line, when i open a new console on the machine its says FOOO and loads the aliases but when i ssh over from the laptop no FOOO and no aliases
2010-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	but a similar echo BAR at the top of /etc/bash.bashrc is displayed on both
2010-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 you're definitely doing it right. mine executes both.
2010-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	hmm, well going to try #bash now didn't know they had a channel :)
2010-10-06T06:06:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 and just normal ssh config, right?
2010-10-06T06:07:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 good bet :) good luck.
2010-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	i think the ssh config is standard, although not entirely sure
2010-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 if you didn't expressly change it, then it should work. i am puzzled myself.
2010-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	bobstro	ddilinge1	 you seem to have spent time with the INVOCATION portion of man bash.
2010-10-06T06:13:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	well, i just grepped man bash for bahsrc
2010-10-06T06:14:00.000Z	ddilinge1		s/bahsrc/bashrc/
2010-10-06T06:16:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	hmm, so it loads profile on login, bashrc on non-login, but to use bashrc on login it has to be explicitly added from ~/.profile.   Doing such fixed my issue :)
2010-10-06T06:16:00.000Z	ddilinge1	bobstro	i guess reading more of the man page would have helped earlier :)
