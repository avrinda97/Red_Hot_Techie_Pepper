2008-02-02T10:43:00.000Z	[mando]		hmm. i set xcompmgr to startup with simple drop shadows, then i logged out, then back in, and now my panels are gone
2008-02-02T10:43:00.000Z	[mando]		help?
2008-02-02T10:44:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	xcompmgr has to be set to autostart when you log in
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	also it isn't entirely bug free
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	[mando]		it was working when it was set up for regular drop shadows =\
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	[mando]		so, what is my next plan of action?
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	if you have it set up for startup remove it
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	from start up
2008-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	[mando]		i can't access any menus
2008-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	alt-f2 should open up a run menu
2008-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	how did you set it to run at start up
2008-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	[mando]		that was before i logged off, when i had menus
2008-02-02T10:47:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	I know but what method did you do to make it run at startup, or if you didn't
2008-02-02T10:48:00.000Z	[mando]	travisat	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=73101&postcount=21
2008-02-02T10:48:00.000Z	[mando]		i used that
2008-02-02T10:49:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	what ubuntu version are you running?
2008-02-02T10:49:00.000Z	[mando]		dapper
2008-02-02T10:49:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	ok does the alt-f2 open a run dialog?
2008-02-02T10:49:00.000Z	[mando]		yes
2008-02-02T10:50:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	ok type in gnome-session-manager and if that doesn't work try gnome-session-properties I don't know what it was called in dapper
2008-02-02T10:50:00.000Z	[mando]		oh, ok, i got it now travisat , i think i can do it from here
2008-02-02T10:50:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	gl
2008-02-02T10:51:00.000Z	[mando]		thanks.
2008-02-02T10:52:00.000Z	travisat	[mando]	also xcompmgr has always been buggy in the session manager you might try a higher order setting, I think if it runs at the wrong time it messes up the panels if I remember right
