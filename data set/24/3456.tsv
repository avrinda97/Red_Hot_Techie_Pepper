2011-01-05T06:25:00.000Z	danub		hey all, how can i install splash screens that i downloaded from gnome website?
2011-01-05T06:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	splash screens for what?
2011-01-05T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	all you can change on the login screen is the wallpaper and the colour of the login box, those things are for gdm1, the currently supported ubuntus use gdm2

2011-01-05T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	you could use the wallpaper maybe

2011-01-05T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	its quite simple, gconf is not disimilar to XP enabling the trash on desktop

2011-02-15T21:03:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	what is the output of: lsb_release -d
2011-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	its always been the same
2011-02-17T01:49:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	just login as root, what could possibly go wrong ;)
2011-02-17T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	root login is a really bad idea and not advised at all
2011-02-17T01:50:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	i know, i was being a smartass :P
2011-02-17T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	i see
2011-02-22T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	run:   sudo apt-get clean    it will happen for you
2011-02-22T06:58:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	ty, ill do that :)
2011-02-22T07:00:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	you seem to be a pretty knowledgable guy, what do you use to track down disk space?
2011-02-22T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	there is disk space analyser but I keep my OS trim. You can remove old kernels to regain 120Mb per kernel
2011-02-22T07:01:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	yeah, im trying to cut back... its at 14 gigs right now and I have no idea where it's hiding all this extra data ;)
2011-02-22T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	run:  uname -a   this is the current kernel
2011-02-22T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	danub	run:  dpkg -l | grep linux-image-2    those are the installed kernels
2011-02-22T07:02:00.000Z	danub	ActionParsnip	yeah right now i have 2 (plus their recovery). want to make sure this update went good before i remove them
