2010-09-02T15:55:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	are you using Apache ?
2010-09-02T15:59:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	yeah I'm using apache
2010-09-02T15:59:00.000Z	AdvoWork		what about a symbolic link?
2010-09-02T15:59:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	ok I'll paste an example of how to do
2010-09-02T16:00:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	cheers
2010-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	http://paste.ubuntu.com/487183/
2010-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	glebihan		add this to /etc/http.conf
2010-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	I mean /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
2010-09-02T16:03:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	my httpd.conf is empty
2010-09-02T16:03:00.000Z	glebihan		doesn't matter
2010-09-02T16:03:00.000Z	glebihan		put this in it
2010-09-02T16:04:00.000Z	glebihan		and restart apache
2010-09-02T16:05:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	ive got similar stuff in my apache2.conf (ie for my rewrites
2010-09-02T16:06:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	this should not go into apache2.conf, which is used for general configuration
2010-09-02T16:06:00.000Z	glebihan		however it will work
2010-09-02T16:06:00.000Z	AdvoWork		ok, so glebihan Alias /var/www/intranet/documents/ /mnt/documents_tab_attachments/ ?
2010-09-02T16:06:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	no
2010-09-02T16:07:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	why whats wrong with that?
2010-09-02T16:07:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	"Alias /path /mnt/attachments" will make "http://ip/path" point to /mnt/attachments
2010-09-02T16:08:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	the first path relative to the sever root
2010-09-02T16:08:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	ahh so if i want to be able to goto ip/intranet/documents it would be  Alias /documents?
2010-09-02T16:10:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	no because this is already in the server directories as a child of intranet
2010-09-02T16:10:00.000Z	glebihan	AdvoWork	you can already access it via http://ip/intranet/documents
2010-09-02T16:11:00.000Z	AdvoWork	glebihan	that works thanks :)
