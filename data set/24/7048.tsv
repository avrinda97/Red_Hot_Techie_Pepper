2008-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	restartme		Hello..
2008-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	restartme		Hi :)
2008-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	restartme		Will you help me?
2008-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	restartme		yep
2008-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	restartme		!ask | eth01
2008-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	restartme		..
2008-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	restartme		:/
2008-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	restartme		I have upgraded to 8.10
2008-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	what video card are you using?
2008-12-28T15:05:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	if its not an issue with preferences, its likely that the driver in xorg.con is falling back to vga
2008-12-28T15:06:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	various things like "lsmod | grep nv" might help
2008-12-28T15:07:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	as will grep nv /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	lsmod lists all drivers running.  | sends the output to grep, which returns only lines with "nv"in them
2008-12-28T15:10:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	and | is not "I", but rather the combo of shift+\  (on US qwerty keyboards at least)
2008-12-28T15:11:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	interesting.  this is the virtual resolution.  eg, you've set the desktop to a size larger then the monitor can display
2008-12-28T15:15:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	for me to be able to help, i'll need to know what is actually running at the moment
2008-12-28T15:15:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	the way that I know to do this will involve using a terminal
2008-12-28T15:16:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	yes, but i'm guessing it would take longer to set that up.  especially if you have a router or such in the way.
2008-12-28T15:18:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	as a note, it does not seem that ssh (the simplest remote login" is accessible.  I'm guessing it would take longer to get that working.
2008-12-28T15:19:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	if you type lsmod, do you see either nv or nvidia listed?
2008-12-28T15:21:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	you need ssh to be running, and for no proxies to be in the way
2008-12-28T15:24:00.000Z	thechris	restartme	the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log will contain a list of things xorg did, or didn't do.
