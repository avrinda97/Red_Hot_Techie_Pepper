2009-04-02T15:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	yeah sudo  has been around since like 1979
2009-04-02T15:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	3D or 2D?
2009-04-02T15:29:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	2D
2009-04-02T15:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	ok if your computer has enough RAM, you can virtual machine that
2009-04-02T15:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	Windows virtual machine inside Ubuntu
2009-04-02T15:30:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	done that too and its way too slow.
2009-04-02T15:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	how much RAM?
2009-04-02T15:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	which virtual machine app?
2009-04-02T15:32:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	I used virtualbox and I have 2GB. I have WinXP 1GB to use
2009-04-02T15:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	ok  if you give the virtualmachine to much virtual RAM, you will get problems
2009-04-02T15:35:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	I tried with 512 as well
2009-04-02T15:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	ok  maybe you should try Qemu or Kqemu even
2009-04-02T15:36:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	believe me I want to have a computer that only uses Linux but Wine doesn't work with it and virtualization doesn't cut it
2009-04-02T15:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	ok well quite a few diffenret virtual machine programs you can try :)
2009-04-02T15:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	VMware?
2009-04-02T15:41:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	some Linux games are utter garbage, though
2009-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	how about getting a games console instead?
2009-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	well anything, but Xbox :)
2009-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	I have a PS2 at the moment
2009-04-02T15:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	if enough gamers, complained to the games companies about not making for Linux, then they would listen, but no  they continue to suppourt Windows games instead by playing them
2009-04-02T15:45:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	well I wrote a few emails to the devs that produce Magic World Online to see if they could make a Linux port and they said that they'll think about it
2009-04-02T15:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	which basically means they won't, because that's what business people are like, if they say stuff like that :D
2009-04-02T15:46:00.000Z	Chowder	sebsebseb	its a free MMORPG, what business?
2009-04-02T15:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Chowder	oh ok
