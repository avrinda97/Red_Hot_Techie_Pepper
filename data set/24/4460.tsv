2007-05-02T06:24:00.000Z	hackle577		im having trouble mounting my ipod (ie, Edgy doesnt even recognize that it's there) is anyone knowledgable on this?
2007-05-02T06:25:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	I'm not very knowledgeable, but have you tried doing watch /var/log/message
2007-05-02T06:25:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	let me try that now
2007-05-02T06:28:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	i put "dmesg" in terminal after i connected it, how can i tell what's up?
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	well you should see something about ipod detected or something
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	I don't know that much about this.
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	try this. unplug the ipod. then type watch dmesg
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	Then plug it in
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	Then see what pops up on the terminal after you plug it in
2007-05-02T06:31:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	i can see a few lines that appear to be about the ipod, but i get a crapload of lines like: "[142501.552000]  bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode2.fw" not available or load failed."
2007-05-02T06:31:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	Thats about your wifi card not working.
2007-05-02T06:32:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	You have a broadcom wifi card. has nothing to do with the ipod.
2007-05-02T06:32:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	Idk man :-(
2007-05-02T06:33:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	hmmm, well i can see some stuff about the iPod but no glaring clues or anything
2007-05-02T06:33:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	put it on pastebin.ca and let me see
2007-05-02T06:35:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	how do i paste to pastebin.ca?
2007-05-02T06:35:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	go to the site. its pretty simple.
2007-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	hackle577	sanityx	i am getting a 500 server error trying to get to pastebin.ca, im gonna post the output in this thread instead: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2573747
2007-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	sanityx	hackle577	ok
