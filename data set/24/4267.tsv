2007-05-21T06:53:00.000Z	Fen_		How can I log in as "Root" user so I can delete this annoying partition I don't wish to see anymore on my Desktop?
2007-05-21T06:54:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	: gksu gparted
2007-05-21T06:54:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	then type your password
2007-05-21T06:59:00.000Z	Fen_	enigma_	Even after doing that and putting in password when I try to unmount the drive I get issue about not having the privilege?
2007-05-21T07:01:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	that should give you root privliges
2007-05-21T07:01:00.000Z	Fen_	enigma_	doesn't seemed to have worked..
2007-05-21T07:02:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	your not trying to unmount a drive you are using are you?
2007-05-21T07:02:00.000Z	Fen_	enigma_	nah, not using that drive
2007-05-21T07:03:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	: Try going to System >> Administration >> GNOME partition editor

2007-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	check personal message in red at top
2007-05-21T07:05:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	: open up a terminal and type gksu apt-get install gparted

2007-05-21T07:06:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	let me know if it installls it
2007-05-21T07:09:00.000Z	Fen_	enigma_	doesn't appear to install it. After it asks me to accept and put in password nothing happens.
2007-05-21T07:10:00.000Z	Fen_	enigma_	Do you think I should restart or something?
2007-05-21T07:10:00.000Z	enigma_	Fen_	: no
