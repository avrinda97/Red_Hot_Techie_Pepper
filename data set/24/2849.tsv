2008-08-20T05:42:00.000Z	mcw		haaaaaaaaaaaaaay
2008-08-20T05:43:00.000Z	mcw		how do you download and install programs from the internet and what form of zipped file is used for ubuntu
2008-08-20T05:44:00.000Z	mcw		tar ect....
2008-08-20T05:44:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	apt-get will get you packages if you know their names.   tar, gzip, bzip2, zip, and rar
2008-08-20T05:44:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	try the Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager)
2008-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	well, using the graphical way, right click on the app, go to the archive manager and use that
2008-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	or, command line ...   tar zxvf file.tar.gz   or   tar jxvf file.tar.bz(2),  or unrar/unzip file.rar or file.zip
2008-08-20T05:48:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	What are you trying to install?
2008-08-20T05:49:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	well, again. in terminal   type tar zxvf /path/to/file  (ie tar zxvf /home/mcw/myfile.tar.gz)
2008-08-20T05:50:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	extracts, configures, and installs
2008-08-20T05:50:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	give it a week or two..   it'll become second nature :)
2008-08-20T05:53:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	ubuntu is nice.
2008-08-20T05:53:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	i'd start by searching the web for a beginners course in linux. It'll give you the basics.
2008-08-20T06:36:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	my apologies for mandriva and open suse
2008-08-20T06:36:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	open suse = novell. novell = lousy support.
2008-08-20T06:52:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	if he was speaking chinese, then you'd see odd symbols on your screen :)
2008-08-20T06:53:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	you're using X-Chat, right?
2008-08-20T06:54:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	ok, then where you're typing everything to tell us stuff,   type in /join #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-08-20T06:56:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	if you can type to the channel, then you can join channels manually by typing in /join #channel-name
2008-08-20T06:59:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	wrong channel :)
2008-08-20T07:00:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	on the bottom of your xchat window, do you see multiple tabs? one saying #ubuntu, and the other saying #ubuntu-offtopic?
2008-08-20T07:04:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	i'd just install plain xchat
2008-08-20T07:05:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	yes
2008-08-20T07:08:00.000Z	Slade	mcw	I'll take a long island iced tea
