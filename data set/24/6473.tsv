2006-02-20T17:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Nice.
2006-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	It comes in the default install of Ubuntu.
2006-02-20T06:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	I had that problem too.  Mucked around in settings and eventually fixed it, but I'm not sure exactly what.
2006-02-20T06:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Ctrl-Shift-{C,V}
2006-02-20T06:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Thought you meant a terminal window.
2006-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	No, you should use apt-get instead and never do anything yourself, 'cause that would take effort and would be silly.
2006-02-20T06:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Synaptic is a frontend to apt.
2006-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	And when you find the package, it's as easy as sudo apt-get install gdesklets
2006-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	It means you should call it a channel, not a chat room.
2006-02-20T08:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	I have some gdesklets.
2006-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Hit 'ch' and then TAB.
2006-02-20T08:13:00.000Z	christopher	tonyyarusso	what else do you use besides desklets.. or do you use them for the majority?
2006-02-20T08:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	I have 4 of those (ext. IP, POP mailbox watcher, countdown timer, and uptime), and have CPU, mem, and disk writing info from the Gnome panel functionality.
2006-02-20T08:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	christopher	Right-clivk, add to panel.
