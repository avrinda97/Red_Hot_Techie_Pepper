2010-07-13T17:23:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	How do i intall from this page : http://intellinuxgraphics.org/download.html
2010-07-13T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	You don't.  The binaries that the source code on that page creates are already in the Ubuntu repositories in package xserver-xorg-video-intel
2010-07-13T17:26:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	Ok.
2010-07-13T17:27:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	in 9.04, wobbly visual effects "Extra" worked. But not in a lucid fresh install. :(
2010-07-13T17:31:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	Any clue ?
2010-07-13T17:38:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	I already told you that you don't need to compile anything from that page.  That software is already in Ubuntu in package xserver-xorg-video-intel, you may need to install that package manually.
2010-07-13T17:39:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	I know about that package from ubuntuforums.. And installed it and restarted computer. No use ./.
2010-07-13T17:40:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	I don't understand. It worked on Jaunty, why not on Lucid ? :(
2010-07-13T17:40:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	Then installing this source will not help, as xserver-xorg-video-intel is built from the X.org xf86-video-intel driver module.
2010-07-13T17:44:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	Is it possible to revert to that of Jaunty's ?
2010-07-13T17:47:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	I don't think so.  Have you tried enabling the intel driver manually after installing that package? See section 5.2 of http://intellinuxgraphics.org/install.html, that is the only step there you should need.
2010-07-13T17:50:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	I will try that . I bookmarked it. I have gtg now. Bye
2010-07-13T17:59:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	I am back. sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf opens an empty file
2010-07-13T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	run; sudo Xorg -configure    to create an intial xorg.conf file that you can edit.
2010-07-13T18:04:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	violinappren thanks
2010-07-13T18:05:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	after it will be over, what to edit in that file ? Section 5.2 of the page that you have given... Just to change the driver name to "intel" ?
2010-07-13T18:05:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	Exactly.
2010-07-13T18:06:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	Also, make sure that the "Module" section contains glx and dri.
2010-07-13T18:06:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	You may also need to create the "DRI" section as described in the end of section 5.3
2010-07-13T18:06:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	How do i exit from a man "command" ? I  close after creating a  new tab. Ctrl + c does not close it ?
2010-07-13T18:06:00.000Z	Pici	Visvanath	pres q
2010-07-13T18:07:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	Thanks, Idleone
2010-07-13T18:13:00.000Z	Visvanath	Pici	Thanks. I will tell you later if it works.
