2007-02-06T11:39:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	care to elaborate?
2007-02-06T11:44:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	..?  That's an apache error, not a conq error
2007-05-18T11:26:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	I ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-18T11:25:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	what did you change before that happened?
2007-05-18T11:26:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	Ok, then what?  do you get a blank screen, or an error message?
2007-05-18T11:27:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	I never get to the desktop :(
2007-05-18T11:28:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	I'm currently managing in irssi :(
2007-05-18T11:28:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	what if you create antoher user account and try to log in?  have you tried rebooting??  Or, rather than rebooting, do a "sudo init 1" then hit ctrl-D to brin ghte system back to runlevle 2
2007-05-18T11:28:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	irssi pwns
2007-05-18T11:28:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	yeah its useful in emergencies but since this is a new installation I have no scripts
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	I will see how things look with a new user
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	tried logging in as a different user?  or init 1 then ctrl D
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	the latter would probably fix it
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	ok
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	how do I "init 1"
2007-05-18T11:29:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	sudo init 1
2007-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	this will kill irssi, since it takes the system to single-user mode..
2007-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	isn't that suspend
2007-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	Quintin	daedra	... no.
2007-05-18T11:37:00.000Z	daedra	Quintin	no luck
