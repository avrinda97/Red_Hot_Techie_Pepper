2008-09-04T15:39:00.000Z	natalisushka		Hello people .. please I need your help. I have a laptop running ubuntu 7.10. Unfortunately, most of it's devices are ATI (which I abhor) .. I had ubuntu 8.04 before and I had some problems with USBs and VGA but sound worked (with problems also, having it mute when playing music with some player after running a flash with a sound, and vise-versa) .. Now VGA is fine in 7.10, but sound doesn't work at all! I just installed it yesterday, and no Sou
2008-09-04T15:39:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	you probably need a newer alsa than what 7.10 provides. and you really should use 8.04
2008-09-04T15:40:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	can't I simply install the driver that 8.04 has?
2008-09-04T15:40:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	driver for what?
2008-09-04T15:41:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	Audio
2008-09-04T15:41:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	no
2008-09-04T15:42:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	why not?
2008-09-04T15:46:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	you didn't explain why?
2008-09-04T15:47:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	no I didn't and I won't
2008-09-04T15:48:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	then say I don't know why!
2008-09-04T15:49:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	I do know but I won't explain to someone without a clue for an hour why
2008-09-04T15:49:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	if you want that hire me as a consultant.
2008-09-04T15:49:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	no thanks. . step aside please
2008-09-04T15:52:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	the driver will be the same, just a different version. aolso the driver is part of the kernel. and urnning a kernel from 8.04 is not supported in 7.10. you will need to compile your own alsa or your own kernel
2008-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	.. now I can say thanks! it didn't take you an hour ;)
2008-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	I didn't explain any why either
2008-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	"why" questions are not always a good thing to ask. especially if you don't care about the technical details like you
2008-09-04T15:53:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	for me it explains why I can't install a driver exising only in 8.04 for a previous version
2008-09-04T15:54:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	you can. the question is how you'd do it. and frm what you asked, you cannot do it unless someine does it essentially for you. which will take several hours here over irc
2008-09-04T15:54:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	your answer was sufficient for me not to search if there is a fast solution or an installation. You also can't judge if I am interested or that I care about the technical details
2008-09-04T15:55:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	I can. I have some experience about this by now
2008-09-04T15:57:00.000Z	natalisushka	wols	I was asking for a fast solution that I may not waste time as it sounds faster for me to reinstall it ... I am sure I do'nt have the experiance you have, but I am also interested. At least as a beginner in system maintenance.
2008-09-04T15:57:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	if I were you I'd use 8.04 and not 7.l10 for several reasons. support being one of them
2008-09-04T15:58:00.000Z	wols	natalisushka	if 7.10 can support your card, then so can 8.04. just might need some wrangling
