2008-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	SuperTM		I can't seem to be able to get the Ubuntu disk to load and bring up normal install.  I however, can install from within windows with Wubi, and use "Start installer with ACPI workarounds".  I do not see such an option for the normal installing of Ubuntu, would I need the alternative CD to do such?
2008-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	SuperTM		Without having to install within windows (Wubi) ?
2008-10-20T10:33:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	what mobo are you on?
2008-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	whatever comes with Dell Inspiron 530
2008-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	linux kernel has ahci mode drivers ready inside
2008-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	can you do an lspci now?
2008-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	I have no idea what you are talking about.  I am still within windows
2008-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	I want to be able to install Ubuntu normally, and get rid of windows.  However that's the only possible way I have seen to get inside of the Ubuntu disk or installer.
2008-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	cant you boot from the bootable disk?
2008-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	Is though Wubi , and the "Start installer with ACPI workarounds"
2008-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	no
2008-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	I do not see the same option on the bootable disk to "start with ACPI work arounds"
2008-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	As with Wubi
2008-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	just for the record this happens with all versions of Ubuntu
2008-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	noacpi i think. (i messed up acpi and ahci !!!)
2008-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	you put it in the line of custom boot options
2008-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	OK, so I need to select the "other options" and add noacpi ?
2008-10-20T10:38:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	to the little line
2008-10-20T10:38:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	yes. i dont have a live cd handy yo put in vbox
2008-10-20T10:38:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	do I need to do it like -noapi, or any special things?
2008-10-20T10:39:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	no. and no dashes. in case this does not work, try acpi=off
2008-10-20T10:40:00.000Z	SuperTM	jim_p	I suppose I shall reboot and try?
2008-10-20T10:40:00.000Z	jim_p	SuperTM	yes
