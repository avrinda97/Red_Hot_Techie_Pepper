2006-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	bImInTroule		and it was working fine
2006-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i just booted into windows for a bit
2006-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	bImInTroule		came back to ubuntu, and the install was broken
2006-04-18T09:48:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i just got an error saying Failed to open config file /etc/modprobe.d/arch-aliases
2006-04-18T09:49:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i think i updated something tho ... it was an automatic update
2006-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	bImInTroule		:/
2006-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	e-sin	bImInTroule	what kind of error were you getting?
2006-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	bImInTroule	e-sin	the one i typed just now about modprobe
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	bImInTroule	e-sin	can you help me out? or am i screwed ?
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i have VERY limited access right now
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i think it's a problem with my display
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	bImInTroule		but, it's whining about accessing stuff
2006-04-18T09:52:00.000Z	bImInTroule		*sigh
2006-04-18T09:52:00.000Z	bImInTroule		how do you login as root in ubuntu, i only got in as root by accident, because something failed
2006-04-18T09:52:00.000Z	bImInTroule		i usually use sudo su to run commands as root
2006-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	bImInTroule		but that got borked
2006-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	bImInTroule		when my install went screwy
2006-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	e-sin	bImInTroule	 i was just asking because about a week ago, my box was doing just fine, then all of a sudden a site i was working on gave php errors.  everything ground to a halt.  gome panels died, things just started crashing like mad.  i rebooted, couldnt get back into ubuntu.  couldnt even boot a live cd or install cd.  segfaults on any cd i tried to boot and also the install on my drive.  turned otu to be bad ram
2006-04-18T09:54:00.000Z	bImInTroule	e-sin	... hmmm, i think this hard drive may be bad actually
2006-04-18T09:54:00.000Z	e-sin	bImInTroule	just sounded kinda similar in the all-of-a-suddenness.  but yeah it does sound like a drive failure, especially if windows is acting up as well
