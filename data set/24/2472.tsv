2010-05-06T22:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	have you tried removing old kernels with 'dpkg' commands?
2010-05-06T22:32:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	I haven't no how do I do that? I'm actually using the oldest version displayed in GRUB, and want to remove the two newer versions.
2010-05-06T22:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	do you know the version numbers of the kernels you want to remove?
2010-05-06T22:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	do you know the version numbers of the kernels you want to remove? if so, show me one
2010-05-06T22:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	looks like to tried to enter a message addressed to me, but all i saw was my nick, nothing after it
2010-05-06T22:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	looks like you* tried to enter a message addressed to me, but all i saw on here was my nick...nothing after it
2010-05-06T22:46:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	I don't no, I know that the one that I want to keep end in -14 and the other I want to remove end in -20 and -21. How do I view the kernels on my system? Then I can give you the full versions.
2010-05-06T22:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	look in /boot --> ls -l /boot/vmlinuz*
2010-05-06T22:48:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	vmlinuz-2.6.31-14-generic I wanna keep and I want to remove vmlinuz-2.6.31-20-generic and vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic
2010-05-06T22:48:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	I also need to add an entry for Windows Vista as GRUB didn't add one automatically.
2010-05-06T22:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	ok, do the following command to see... what all packages you'll want to get rid of. you'll want to go ahead and get rid of things like linux-tools-2.6.32-20 and linux-headers-2.6.31-20... to show things like that, do the following --> dpkg -l '*2.6.31-20' | grep '^ii'
2010-05-06T22:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	when you've had a look at what you want to remove... then do the following for each package you want to remove --> dpkg --purge <package_name>
2010-05-06T22:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	when you remove kernels, update-grub will be run automatically and your grub boot menu will is therefore updated automatically
2010-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	=sorry.. but i messed up a command that i gave you earlier. i left out an asterisks... here is the proper command...
2010-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	dpkg -l '*2.6.31-20' | grep '^ii'
2010-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	dpkg -l '*2.6.31-20*' | grep '^ii'
2010-05-06T22:56:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	okay then I'll give that a shot now.
2010-05-06T22:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	use this command --> dpkg -l '*2.6.31-20*' | grep '^ii' to see all the 2.6.31-20 stuff that's installed. use dpkg --purge <package_name> to remove the packages you want to get rid of
2010-05-06T22:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	roger.. good luck!
2010-05-06T22:57:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	no packages were found.
2010-05-06T22:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	hmmm. try dpkg -l linux-image* | grep '^ii'
2010-05-06T23:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	hello. get it sorted out yet?
2010-05-06T23:21:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	onetinsoldier	thanks so much. I have managed to remove the unneeded packages!
2010-05-06T23:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	SealedWithAKiss	cool, good deal. you're welcome :-)
