2010-06-14T17:37:00.000Z	ravibn		yes! no response from any keys
2010-06-14T17:37:00.000Z	bricky		just through ubuntu right

2010-06-14T17:38:00.000Z	ravibn		any recovery from that ? I tried to run without installing the same thing happened
2010-06-14T17:38:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	I dunno never heard that before, you could google it and see what comes up
2010-06-14T17:39:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	I doubt youll get that much material on it tho, kinda strange
2010-06-14T17:39:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: why it would not run from the cd alone  without installing ?
2010-06-14T17:39:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	wubi is a .exe file, not a live cd? afaik
2010-06-14T17:40:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: is it bcos of the nvidia chip onboard ?
2010-06-14T17:40:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	keyboard issues? highly doubtful
2010-06-14T17:40:00.000Z	bricky		or do you mean the screen went dead,
2010-06-14T17:40:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: bcos the display goes blank
2010-06-14T17:40:00.000Z	bricky		ahh,
2010-06-14T17:41:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: and latter that machine
2010-06-14T17:42:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: any quickfix solution ?
2010-06-14T17:42:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	I dunno exactly what but someone here could tell you how to recompile xorg.conf im sure (and boot in terminal perhaps)
2010-06-14T17:42:00.000Z	bricky		thats the only thing I can think of, you gotta edit your xorg.conf , maybe reset drivers to 'generic' or whatever name they go by
2010-06-14T17:42:00.000Z	bricky		I dont know how to do that though sorry
2010-06-14T17:48:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: can you suggest better version for my Dell Latitude e6510
2010-06-14T17:48:00.000Z	ravibn	bricky	: u there ?
2010-06-14T17:51:00.000Z	bricky	ravibn	im not that good with linux sorry
