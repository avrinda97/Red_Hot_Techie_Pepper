2005-12-10T07:43:00.000Z	nelsmar		thank god it only takes 2 mins including reseting x
2005-12-10T07:43:00.000Z	Tony_Sidaway	nelsmar	have you tried googling on this problem? It's a bit too hardware-specific for #ubuntu
2005-12-10T07:44:00.000Z	nelsmar		Tony_sidaway i just need a device monitor that will execute commands on input depending... liek somethign that would watch /dev/mouse and when it see's input it forwards... except watch /dev/sonypi
2005-12-10T07:44:00.000Z	nelsmar		its not to hardware specific it outputs raw data..... in 16bit i beleive
2005-12-10T07:44:00.000Z	nelsmar		insipid what is your problem?
2005-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	nelsmar		im almost tempted to use xorg.conf and map it as a mouse....
2005-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	Tony_Sidaway	nelsmar	sounds  like something you could run up in perl, python, guile, whatever.  Why the problem with programming?
2005-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	nelsmar	mulder	no it was a gift why?
2005-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	nelsmar		Tony_sideaway ive never programed C/C++ in linux i dont know how to make use of makefiles :(
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	nelsmar		wasnt going to start playing with C++ for another week or so
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	Tony_Sidaway	nelsmar	you don't need all that.  Just grab man perl and get coding.
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	nelsmar	mulder	ah ; / they arnt as good as they used to be, but i love myn :) linux hates all vaio
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	nelsmar		Tony_sidaway maybe i will hhmmmm man perl have some basics?
2005-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	nelsmar		Insipid did you install new(er) nvidia drivers? if so what version
2005-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	Tony_Sidaway	nelsmar	get the Camel book if you need more, or just look on the web for perl tutorials.
