2005-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	muwu		Hi. How do I mount a newly created EXT3 partition with all read and write access for originary non-root user? (been readying How'tos and can't figure it out). thanks.
2005-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	muwu		currently, my /etc/fstab is : /dev/hdb6       /mnt/backup ext3   users,auto,rw 0 1
2005-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	muwu		it's kinda funny, the guide has Howto on how to mount FAT and NTFS, but no EXT3~!
2005-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	muwu		anyone?
2005-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	muwu		Also, is it possible to add two partitions on different drives to create one mount point?
2005-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	in /etc/fstab you want in the options column "users,rw"
2005-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	currently, currently, my /etc/fstab is : /dev/hdb6       /mnt/backup ext3   users,auto,rw 0 1
2005-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	if you add two drives to the one mount point, happiness does not ensue...the last drive masks the previous one
2005-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	oh...
2005-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	I'm not sure what the point of doing it would be anyway...
2005-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	kinda running out of space on one drive...and it's kinda hard to move around stuff..
2005-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	have you remounted the drive manually with those options?
2005-05-04T07:06:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	ls -al shows that the files don't belong to you?
2005-05-04T07:08:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	in #flood.. I have posted the output
2005-05-04T07:12:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	what he said :-/
2005-05-04T07:13:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	I have gained write access as user... after doing "chown xman /mnt/backup"
2005-05-04T07:15:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	are you using ubuntu or kubuntu?
2005-05-04T07:15:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	ubuntu with KDE 3.4 apt-gotted
2005-05-04T07:15:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	I think kubuntu is significantly different/better than ubuntu-with-kde
2005-05-04T07:16:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	they are DIFFERENT?
2005-05-04T07:17:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	so I'm told...I've always liked gnome so I don't know
2005-05-04T07:37:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	it probably won't get worse ;)
2005-05-04T07:37:00.000Z	muwu	djm62	yes.. :(
2005-05-04T07:38:00.000Z	djm62	muwu	genuinely, it will get better...it's a question of how much, how fast
