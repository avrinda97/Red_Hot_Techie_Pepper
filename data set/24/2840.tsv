2008-08-09T08:00:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	someone suggested the page might not work correctly in firefox

2008-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	Scorp__	fonzarelli	Yeah, same here... Have been lookin for it since such a long time. Even upgraded the firmware but no use...
2008-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	if it were me, i would install the HTTPFox extension, then try to access the page and see if any errors appear that might help me narrow down the problem
2008-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	Scorp__	fonzarelli	wats the HTTPFox extension ???
2008-08-09T08:06:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	check it out:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6647
2008-08-09T08:07:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	it basically shows you any elements on the page that might be erroring out, etc

2008-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	Scorp__	fonzarelli	Hey, gotcha... Its a prob with some javascript execution.. What could be done about that ??
2008-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	what kind of error is it,  is it like a 404 missing .js page?
2008-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	fonzarelli	Scorp__	maybe try googling those results from that error you found
