2008-07-10T17:24:00.000Z	felix		Hello, i am a newbie in ubuntu. Im trying to install bibus for my openoffice.org and therefore have to edit the sources.list. But if i try to save it, it wont work (i use konqueror and Dolphin). How can i get it done?
2008-07-10T17:25:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	: i guess the problem is that you are not "superuser"
2008-07-10T17:25:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	: actually you are not root
2008-07-10T17:25:00.000Z	felix		yeah i guess so but i didnt find any kind of administrator mode
2008-07-10T17:25:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	: open a console and edit your file like this : sudo gedit sources.list
2008-07-10T17:26:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	you will be asked for your root password
2008-07-10T17:26:00.000Z	felix		ill try thx
2008-07-10T17:26:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	: this will probably save your file
2008-07-10T17:26:00.000Z	kosnick	felix	: watch what you are doing with it , and preferably save a back up before
