2012-11-26T14:43:00.000Z	piggy_		can i adjust the size of a partition so it's larger?
2012-11-26T14:43:00.000Z	piggy_		what tool should i use?
2012-11-26T14:43:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	gparted
2012-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	thanks, but the option for 'resizing' is ghosted out, any ideas?
2012-11-26T14:52:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	depends entirely on your layout and what is mounted
2012-11-26T14:52:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	screenshots to the rescue!

2012-11-26T14:52:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	i want to increase sda1
2012-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	it is mounted, you can't resize something that is mounted
2012-11-26T14:53:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	ah, but if it was unmounted how would i resize it, and could i? or would that little partition (between sda1 and the unallocated) get in teh way?
2012-11-26T14:54:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	it's always recommended to use gparted from a live environment
2012-11-26T14:54:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	ah ok, this is all VM stuff, what's the best way to do it?
2012-11-26T14:54:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	virtualbox
2012-11-26T14:55:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	turn off the vm, make sure you configure it to boot a livecd and turn it back on, it should boot the cd rather than your vm's harddisk
2012-11-26T14:55:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	thx
2012-11-26T14:56:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	yes, you'd need to move the partition thats in the way too
2012-11-26T14:56:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	any reason you got swap in an extended partition?
2012-11-26T14:57:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	hehe, no idea
2012-11-26T14:57:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	but if gparted needs to be installed via apt-get, how can i do it via a livecd?
2012-11-26T14:58:00.000Z	piggy_		i thoguth livecd doenst let me install stuff?
2012-11-26T14:59:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	gparted should be on the livecd
2012-11-26T14:59:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	i prefer to use partedmagic for livecd partitioning
2012-11-26T15:00:00.000Z	piggy_	auronandace	ah ok, does that come with ubuntu too?
2012-11-26T15:01:00.000Z	auronandace	piggy_	i think so
