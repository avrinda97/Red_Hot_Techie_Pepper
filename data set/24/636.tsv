2012-06-24T00:41:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	i think there is an option in gsettings/gconf/dconf under applications->nautilus
2012-06-24T00:42:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	i'm sorry im not used to this unity setup, i can't find 'applications'
2012-06-24T00:42:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	you would need to install gconf-editor or dconf-utils
2012-06-24T00:42:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	gconf-editor is sorta like regedit on windows
2012-06-24T00:43:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	yeah thats gnome, its gonna download all the gnome stuff back as a result :)
2012-06-24T00:43:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	well if you arent using gnome what is drawing your desktop?
2012-06-24T00:44:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	I have no idea anymore >.<
2012-06-24T00:44:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	ok. what gui do you select on login?
2012-06-24T00:45:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	not that any of this will change my answer, which is going to be "i don't know" but maybe someone else will know
2012-06-24T00:45:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	if its the standard then its unity which is gnome based
2012-06-24T00:46:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	everything has changed beyond recognition
2012-06-24T00:46:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	yes welcome to 12.04
2012-06-24T00:51:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	they are all hitting the same backend gsettings/dconf
2012-06-24T00:53:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	there is a way to disable nm on specific devices
2012-06-24T00:55:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	see /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
2012-06-24T00:57:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	here it is. look at /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and then read the manpage http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/man5/NetworkManager.conf.5.html sections on keyfile and ifupdown
2012-06-24T00:58:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	so you could either (a) list the interface in /etc/network/interfaces OR you could add an unmanage-devices= line to a new [keyfile] section in the conf
2012-06-24T07:52:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	these days you don't need a crossover cable. most nic's can detect
2012-06-24T07:53:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	aren't i ole'school
2012-06-24T07:53:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	yeah i've never meet a computer that couldn't detect
2012-06-24T07:59:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	thats interesting, i've always put the boot part in the back
2012-06-24T08:00:00.000Z	Lounge	escott	would it work if the boot partition was on a thumbdrive with only 256 mb?
2012-06-24T08:01:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	it should
2012-06-24T08:01:00.000Z	escott	Lounge	as long as the bios supports usb boots, but i wouldn't trust a bios that can't read the full disk to do a usb boot properly :)
