2008-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	hightide	is your computer behind a router?
2008-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	hightide	jrib	nope its not behind a router
2008-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	hightide	so it's connected directly to the internet?  Do you have a firewall?
2008-11-17T06:59:00.000Z	hightide	jrib	yes its connected directly to the internet.. how would i check if i have a firewall?? coz.. i hav'nt installed any firewall at all... is there a default firewall through ubuntu 8.10?
2008-11-17T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	hightide	no there isn't.  Does 'sudo iptables -L' return anything?
