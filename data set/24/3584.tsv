2007-12-17T18:46:00.000Z	QuintinRSA		Uh, graphics card related help pls?
2007-12-17T18:47:00.000Z	QuintinRSA		Thanks, just wanted to get someones attention
2007-12-17T18:47:00.000Z	QuintinRSA		I have an ATI Radeon Mobility M6LY... which driver?
2007-12-17T18:48:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	savvas00 is right, but try the open source "radeon" driver first ...
2007-12-17T18:49:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	the ATI-provided drivers
2007-12-17T19:00:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	good question ! they should already be installed, they're part of the X server
2007-12-17T19:01:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	chances are your X server is using the "ati" (ie. no opengl) driver
2007-12-17T19:06:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	yep it is the "ati" driver
2007-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.dadehoog && gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-17T19:07:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	scroll down to the "Driver" line and change it to read "radeon" instead of "ati"
2007-12-17T19:08:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	then you'll need to save the file, exit gedit, and restart X. Simply logging in and logging out should do it.
2007-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	hokay, did that... brb... *crosses thumbs*
2007-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	do you want the recovery command ..?
2007-12-17T19:15:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	any joy ?
2007-12-17T19:16:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	right ... so it loaded fine - until "Desktop Effects" ?
2007-12-17T19:17:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	yep...I had that problem ever since I ran DPKG Reconfigure X... right mouse zoomed in, left mouse takes screenshot
2007-12-17T19:18:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	was OpenGL support working ?
2007-12-17T19:18:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	eg. glxgears ?
2007-12-17T19:19:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	bummer. Well, to revert back to the old driver ... just run: sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.dadehoog //etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-17T19:19:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	but no worries, seems I might need to re-install in order to fix everything... am still learning (after a year(!)) anyhow
2007-12-17T19:20:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	thanks a stack anyways...
2007-12-17T19:20:00.000Z	dadehoog	QuintinRSA	no worries - I think the issues are unrelated though
2007-12-17T19:20:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	haha I see that
2007-12-17T19:20:00.000Z	QuintinRSA	dadehoog	Yep.. cyal8r
