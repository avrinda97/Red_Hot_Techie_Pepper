2005-05-18T07:57:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	more information needed
2005-05-18T07:58:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	if you are using dhcp it should just work
2005-05-18T07:59:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	network connection, adsl, cable >
2005-05-18T07:59:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	not helpful :A
2005-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	does ifconfig say you have an ip address ?
2005-05-18T08:02:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	there is no ifconfig in windows
2005-05-18T08:04:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	try to ping an IP in linux as well as domain names
2005-05-18T08:05:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	there is no address for DHCP.. the computer will simply ask anyone for an IP
2005-05-18T09:22:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	what connection ?
2005-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	I still can't access.. I tried to use static IP and ifconfig says 127.0.0.1 as IP
2005-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	thats localhost
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	what happens if you run dhclient eth0 ?
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	it refuses... I doesn't recognize the command
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	what is the error ?
2005-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	When I try to access internet it says "connection refused..." and I don't get any ip from DHCP even if I type dhcpcd eth0 in the root
2005-05-18T09:30:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	dhcpcd isn't in ubuntu I said dhclient
2005-05-18T09:31:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	It doesn't like if I just typed SU
2005-05-18T09:31:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	you typed sudo dhclient eth0
2005-05-18T09:31:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	I didn't like just the command SU...maybe it's default?
2005-05-18T09:32:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	for the love of god
2005-05-18T09:33:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	sudo dhclient eth0
2005-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	Nermal	StarMkeSE	kindly explain why you are willing to listen to thoreauputic and not listen to 3 requests from me to enter the command stated
2005-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	StarMkeSE	Nermal	I'm listening to you but I need to read more about this to. I'm writning down all what you have said
