2009-10-04T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kubanc	if you are running compiz and want to start metacity, you can run: metacity --replace
2009-12-10T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kubanc	if you use a G1 phone use transmission (default in ubuntu) and there is an app to connect to te app and manage torrents (possibly one for iphones, not sure. I am not an isheep)
