2009-04-16T22:17:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	his system lost power in the middle of an upgrade and now the cache is foobared
2010-05-08T10:23:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	mossi: if it's not implicitly there, then he should be able to add one manually
2010-07-24T10:40:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	back off, bub
2010-07-24T10:41:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	I didn't even swear, and I was quite on-topic. Please be sure that you know what you're talking about before utilizing the bot, thanks.
2010-07-24T10:42:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	then stop making fun of others
2010-07-24T10:43:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	didn't make fun of anyone, just pointed out a difference between thinking first before acting, and acting before thinking.
2010-07-24T10:44:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	now, unless you have any constructive advice on libgtk1.2...
2010-08-05T11:50:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	shut up
2010-08-05T11:51:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	please stop
2010-08-05T11:51:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	welcome to /ignore
2010-08-05T11:52:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	stop abusing the bot, and this is entirely on-topic, so stop trying to play channel god.
2011-02-06T19:42:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	18 months = 1.5 years, yes
2012-04-30T07:21:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	It's better to just follow the already-documented directions
2012-04-30T07:22:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	installing the deb does install opera... And also adds the repository if that is what you mean
2012-04-30T07:23:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	relying on the official documentation is the preferred method in this channel rather than pointing people to go directly to an external website. If the documentation requires it, it will let them know.
2012-08-03T20:26:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	you allways miss, try pt next time ;)
2012-08-03T20:26:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	it all looks the same to me ;)
2012-11-19T01:20:00.000Z	xangua	Gnea	ooh he is using 10.04, no 10.10 so no :) two digits make a big diference
2012-11-19T01:21:00.000Z	Gnea	xangua	it doesn't make much of a difference in this case, we know he's using 10.04 ;)
