2008-12-05T00:43:00.000Z	starhawk		I am installing 8.10 64 on an emachine with 3 gigs of ram 3200 processor and the install stops at initramfs anyone know what it wants me to do
2008-12-05T00:44:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	well, does it give any error?
2008-12-05T00:45:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	What do you do exactly? You put the CD inside, get the menu, select Install Ubuntu, and then it stops?
2008-12-05T00:46:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	no just to type help for options
2008-12-05T00:46:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	You might consider reburning that CD, it seems you did that wrong...
2008-12-05T00:47:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	that is what happens
2008-12-05T00:48:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	What ISO file did you use for burning the CD?
2008-12-05T00:48:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	 I used k3b iso 9633 I belive
2008-12-05T00:49:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	No, what was the name of the ISO file?
2008-12-05T00:50:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	 ubuntu 8.10 64
2008-12-05T00:50:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	The EXACT name of the file
2008-12-05T00:50:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	for example: ubuntu-810-install.iso
2008-12-05T00:52:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	ubuntu 8.10 amd64
2008-12-05T00:52:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	Thats still not the name... type the file's exact name!
2008-12-05T00:55:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	I am sorry, but if you are unable understanding me, I cannot help you. It's important, that you tell me the name of the ISO file you used. Maybe you have a different ISO file, than the default installer
2008-12-05T00:58:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	There was an ISO file on your PC which you have used for creating the CD, right? Now you should go inside that folder, and check it's name
2008-12-05T01:02:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	Good. Are you sure you have a CPU with 64 bit?
2008-12-05T01:04:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	 it says amd athlon 64 right on the front and it is the original processor
2008-12-05T01:04:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	use "cat /proc/cpuinfo" for finding out exact CPU information
2008-12-05T01:05:00.000Z	norbert79	starhawk	Neverthless, try to reburn that disk once again, and select the "Verify" option at the option window in K3B when burning a disk
2008-12-05T01:08:00.000Z	starhawk	norbert79	HOW CAN i SEND YOU THE OUTPUT FROM THE TERMINAL
