2007-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	oxeimon3		are hardware drivers automatically installed when you install ubuntu?
2007-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	oxeimon3		well, I'm having trouble connecting to the internet
2007-07-12T11:43:00.000Z	oxeimon3		and I dont know if it's my settings, or if the driver hasn't been installed
2007-07-12T11:44:00.000Z	oxeimon3		well, it's called an ET-131x PCI-E Ethernet Controll, by Agere Systems
2007-07-12T11:44:00.000Z	oxeimon3		*Controller*
2007-07-12T11:45:00.000Z	oxeimon3		and under the Device manager, it says: "Device Type: Unknown, Capabilities: Unknown"
2007-07-12T11:46:00.000Z	oxeimon3		I'm pretty sure it's my ethernet card
2007-07-12T11:46:00.000Z	oxeimon3		I am unable to use the local network
2007-07-12T11:46:00.000Z	oxeimon3		ie, I can't connect to google
2007-07-12T11:47:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	run ifconfig at the console and see if your card has  valid ip address
2007-07-12T11:48:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	have you tried?
2007-07-12T11:48:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	look closely - iFconfig
2007-07-12T12:27:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	not sure how far you got with amidaniel, but have you determibed whether you have an ip address?
2007-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	yes. it would be the line syarting with 'inet address' and will ususally be something like 192.168...
2007-07-12T12:30:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	what about for just the eth0 ?
2007-07-12T12:30:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	looks like a virtual device of some sort. Do you have a DHCP server?
2007-07-12T12:31:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	can you go have a look at your /etc/resolv.conf file
2007-07-12T12:34:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	try adding the following line at the end of /etc/resolv.conf nameserver 208.67.222.222
2007-07-12T12:36:00.000Z	oxeimon3	skollie	alright done that
2007-07-12T12:36:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	can you connect to any other computer on your network?
2007-07-12T12:36:00.000Z	oxeimon3	skollie	is that domain line correct?
2007-07-12T12:37:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	while you are having this problem, because it is either a DNS or a DHCP problem, I think
2007-07-12T12:39:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	have you tried restarting your network?
2007-07-12T12:41:00.000Z	skollie	oxeimon3	do this - sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
