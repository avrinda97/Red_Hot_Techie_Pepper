2009-09-19T08:23:00.000Z	hittingpilot		does anyone know how to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu with ubuntu installed first?
2009-09-19T08:24:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	What's your partition layout?
2009-09-19T08:25:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	What is your partitioning scheme?  Or are you an end user that doesn't understand linux much?
2009-09-19T08:26:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Basically, in order to install ubuntu, or any linux distro, and have it work with Windows, you must either have a grub boot partition, or you must install grub on your ubuntu partition, and copy the boot partition into a file on the windows drive.
2009-09-19T08:26:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	right now I only have 1 hard drive formatted, and it has Ubuntu on an ext4 partition, I am planning to install windows 7 on another drive, and have 1 more drive for backup
2009-09-19T08:27:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Oh, well that shouldn't be a problem then.  Which disk is your primary disk?
2009-09-19T08:27:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	What won't boot anymore?
2009-09-19T08:28:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Yeah, the boot order in the bios.  Does grub come with a menu then?
2009-09-19T08:29:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	the Ubuntu drive is first, naturally, and my first 2 attempts have been with windows first, they failed miserably
2009-09-19T08:29:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	I have a grub config like http://pastebin.com/d2a6d3fec
2009-09-19T08:30:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Does your grub config for Windows look anything like that?  And, did grub come up with the menu when you boot?
2009-09-19T08:31:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	oh! of course, I used the default setting from the ubuntu installation
2009-09-19T08:32:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Oh, my grub config wasn't made by ubuntu, I made it, so I don't know what ubuntu would do during install.  So, it's important that I know it's actually the same.
2009-09-19T08:32:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	stupid me didn't look at what the install generated
2009-09-19T08:32:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Do you get some errors?  Is it just hanging on you?  What do you see on the screen if it's hanging?
2009-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	is what hanging?
2009-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	hang as in not respond, like a dead man hanging from a noose.
2009-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	I know what hang is, I was referring to what you asked was hanging?
2009-09-19T08:34:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	oh, is the boot sequence hanging somewhere?
2009-09-19T08:34:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	and where, and what is displayed, etc.
2009-09-19T08:34:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	I thought you said you were having some problems with it booting?
2009-09-19T08:35:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	You mentioned it not booting anymore if you add Windows 7 to the list.  So I assumed you meant you had attempted a Windows 7 installation before.
2009-09-19T08:37:00.000Z	Trent_	hittingpilot	Okay, I'm a bit confused then.  What is not booting, when you add Windows 7 to the list?  Is grub not starting up?  Is ubuntu not starting up?
2009-09-20T03:08:00.000Z	hittingpilot	Trent_	you ther?
