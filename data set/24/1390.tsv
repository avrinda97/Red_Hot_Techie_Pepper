2010-07-29T23:58:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		seems I cannot get my ethernet port workin, how good is using wifi for a laptop server
2010-07-30T00:00:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		the server will be RIGHT next to the wifi box
2010-07-30T00:01:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		I plan to make this laptop a media, irc, and print server
2010-07-30T00:01:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		for now
2010-07-30T00:02:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	severs need two main things to work well, Network Bandwidth and RAM, depending of course on i's intended purpose. WiFI is certainly not the preferred choice for Network I/O on servers.
2010-07-30T00:06:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	on a couple of HP servers In built, I had to build them without NIC support first, then ndiswrapper / modprobe the drivers afterwards.
2010-07-30T00:07:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	well once installed the needed driver is all ready there, I just can't get the computer to use it
2010-07-30T00:10:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	one thing I do, before install, is "disable" all network cards, internal nics as well as internal wifi so it wont laod a similar, but non functional driver by mistake.
2010-07-30T00:14:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	what if I can't find a windows driver for my dell?
2010-07-30T00:15:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	They are there, you just have to dig fer them. Especially with Dell, as its their own Chipset Drivers. Dell is a tougher one, as you can't go to the chipset mfg to get them.
2010-07-30T00:16:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	what's the NIC model, yousaid Insp. 2500 Laptop ?
2010-07-30T00:16:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	ya
2010-07-30T00:17:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	not sure what the NIC is inside
2010-07-30T00:18:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	I have the alt ubuntu disk only
2010-07-30T00:18:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	I can use that command from the shell I dropped to right?
2010-07-30T00:19:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	brb I'll try the command (is currently on another comp)
2010-07-30T00:22:00.000Z	ke1ha	ShapeShifter499	just do a: lspci | grep Networ
2010-07-30T00:25:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	that comnmand shows nothing, btw I'm using the shell you can access on the alt ubuntu disk
2010-07-30T00:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	it shows a 56k modem in using just lspci
2010-07-30T00:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	its not showing any network card
2010-07-30T00:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	ke1ha	*ethernet card
