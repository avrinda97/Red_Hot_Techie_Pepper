2009-05-05T20:35:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	well, asadmin and all the other glassfish thingies still work by the book, so...
2009-05-05T20:35:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	Its not really anything ubuntu specific...
2009-05-05T20:36:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	but i can't configure the default installation. only my personal domains
2009-05-05T20:37:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	You can configure the default installation as long as you are switching to the user it's configured for - but it IS more elegant to just have your own domains, yse
2009-05-05T20:37:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	Better not use the default one, actaully.
2009-05-05T20:37:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	but how can i stop it and make it never start up automatically?
2009-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	aah. perhaps it's in /etc/init.d/glassfish?
2009-05-05T20:39:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	or /etc/rcX.d/glassfish
2009-05-05T20:40:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	ok, did not know about rcX.d directory
2009-05-05T20:41:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	not in any of the rcX.d directories either there eit
2009-05-05T20:46:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	not in any of the rcX.d directories either
2009-05-05T20:47:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	and you did check /etc/init.d/glassfish?
2009-05-05T20:47:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	yes, that script doesn't exist either
2009-05-05T20:48:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	odd, it used to be started this way when installed by ubuntu
2009-05-05T20:49:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	the package i installed is called "glassfishv2" and not the "glassfish-appserv"
2009-05-05T20:50:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	i don't know how this one is started, then... do you run a command or something?
2009-05-05T20:53:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	no, i just installed it through aptitude and it started by itself
2009-05-05T20:55:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	Ubuntu would, by default, usually use these files / directories I pointed you at to run something on startup. But I'm not sure if you have even rebooted in the meantime?
2009-05-05T20:56:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	I usually look for startup scripts in /etc/init.d. and no, I haven't rebooted since the installation, do you think it would help?
2009-05-05T20:57:00.000Z	Radtoo	boobsbr	It is entirely possible that apt just started a glassfish server with a domain for you, once, and that this default domain doesn't get started automatically the next time anyways.
2009-05-05T20:58:00.000Z	boobsbr	Radtoo	thanks for you support, i will try to reboot
