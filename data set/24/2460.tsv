2008-12-05T04:20:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	you should just be able to add it to your Panel
2008-12-05T04:20:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	is it just under the add to panel thing already? so i dont have to install it?
2008-12-05T04:22:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	is gnomenu the one where you get one button? and all your things are under there like M$
2008-12-05T04:22:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	should be
2008-12-05T04:23:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	im trying to install this: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/GnoMenu+-+consolidated+menu+for+gnome?content=93057
2008-12-05T04:23:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	is that just a skin for the one button menu?
2008-12-05T04:25:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I run a Debian server and same.  I love it.
2008-12-05T04:26:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	my favourite thing about it is it enables me to manage all aspects of the server remotely, say from school, so i can add FTP users and let my freinds upload things for me to check out later :)
2008-12-05T04:27:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	exactly. I'm too lazy to go conf diving all day long.
2008-12-05T04:27:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	same, nice graphical layout, works nicely for me :D
2008-12-05T04:27:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I remember the old versions.  They were a treat.  Previously they didn't hide the modules that weren't in use.  HAha
2008-12-05T04:29:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	yeah, i think its good too that i can install stuff remoely too, i have a freind whos in here right now, and i can fix stuff on his server for him when it breaks using webmin :D:D:D
2008-12-05T04:29:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I have someone like that.  I get phone calls at 3 AM.  "Uhm, I think I messed something up..." Me: >/
2008-12-05T04:30:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	See AJF355? hes the one that i ususaly fix stuff for when it craps up :p
2008-12-05T04:31:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I think it's just a widget for the bar.  But I dunno
2008-12-05T04:31:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	would the original gnome-look.org page be of any use to you?
2008-12-05T04:32:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	whoah, shit! thats bad!!! i usualy delete users manually
2008-12-05T04:32:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I think it's a widget.  Download it and read the README file.
2008-12-05T04:32:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	ok thanks
2008-12-05T04:32:00.000Z	[e]Lement	lenswipe	I fixed the script. And it works now.  But here's what I did.  I wrote the executable in C++ so he couldn't get smart and edit it.
2008-12-05T04:33:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	lol, good idea. A little knowledge can be dangerous
2008-12-05T04:33:00.000Z	lenswipe	[e]Lement	so what was wrong with the script? did it just get into a fixed loop and delete everyone?
