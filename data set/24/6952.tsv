2005-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	ubuntu		it asks me for the pci-bus
2005-06-03T13:32:00.000Z	ubuntu		and i have no idea what to tell it
2005-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	ubuntu		it does see the ati card and asks me if the model is correct
2005-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	ubuntu		and it is
2005-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	ubuntu		ok. then i have no idea how to get x-server to work then :-(
2005-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	ubuntu		whichone
2005-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	ubuntu		which one
2005-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	ubuntu		i'm sure i have the intel already disabled

2005-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	ubuntu		wouldn't the intel already be disabled
2005-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	I don't know, to be honest
2005-06-03T13:06:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	try `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg`  (if this is ubuntu 5.04 )
2005-06-03T13:06:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	yes
2005-06-03T13:07:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	that command will ask questions - you answer them
2005-06-03T13:08:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	it will ask for your password
2005-06-03T13:08:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	if this is warty, the command is different
2005-06-03T13:09:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	I assume you have the recent release
2005-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	use xchat (instlled by default)
2005-06-03T13:31:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	did you answer the questions?
2005-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	whichever you don't want to use
2005-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	you might paste the error at pastebin.com and ask people to look at it: I have to go again soon I'm sfraid
2005-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	I'm no expert on x configuration anyway
2005-06-03T13:40:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	as I said, /root is root's home dir, not the root partition
2005-06-03T13:41:00.000Z	bystander	ubuntu	ubuntu is almost exactly the same as knoppix in these respects
