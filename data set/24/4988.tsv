2006-11-25T14:32:00.000Z	atomikulinux		I think im in there
2006-11-25T14:32:00.000Z	atomikulinux		Hey there, I've just realised the hard drive ubuntu is on is faulty. I do have another one spare though. Is there an easy way to copy all the files across?
2006-11-25T14:33:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	You may use dd
2006-11-25T14:34:00.000Z	atomikulinux	fnf	okay. So i'm thinking of plugging in a spare hard drive instead of one of the cdrom drives. Then copying it over with "dd". Afterwards ill take out the ubuntu drive and put the spare drive where the ubuntu drive is
2006-11-25T14:35:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	It really depends on your configuration, the best way IMO is to move your home dir into a safe partition then thrash the driver, in case you didn't keep your home dir in a separate partition.
2006-11-25T14:37:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Plain copying into another partition could work, but most likely will not work out-of-the-box.
2006-11-25T14:53:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Please restate, what do you have now ?
2006-11-25T14:54:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Is your drive an IDE or a SATA ?
2006-11-25T14:54:00.000Z	atomikulinux	fnf	Uhhh... IDE
2006-11-25T14:54:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Sorry, I just acknowledge yours in an USB
2006-11-25T14:55:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Ok..
2006-11-25T14:55:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	IDE devices are listed in /dev in order: Your first drive would be named hda1, 2nd is hda2 and so on.
2006-11-25T14:56:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	I mean your partitions, HDDs are listed in hda, hdb.... order
2006-11-25T14:56:00.000Z	atomikulinux	fnf	okay sec
2006-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	So you currently have a hardrive and one partition on that, is that your only HDD ?
2006-11-25T15:00:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Do you see another hdab, hdc other than your first drive ?
2006-11-25T15:06:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	cfdisk is reliable and easy to use.
2006-11-25T15:07:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	OTOH, you may run gparted, but that doesn't guaranteed your boot sectors will not be messed up.
2006-11-25T15:07:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Do you see other device listed in /dev ? Other than hda, do you see hdb, hdc... ?
2006-11-25T15:08:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	then use gparted.
2006-11-25T15:09:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Alt+F2 then type into the textbox: 'gksudo gparted'
2006-11-25T15:10:00.000Z	fnf	atomikulinux	Ouch. Are you running ubuntu desktop ? That only exists in the desktop version, I forgot to mention.
