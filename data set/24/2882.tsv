2008-07-10T05:50:00.000Z	jm2k		i have Hardy with kernel 2.6.22.14-generic, would it be smart to update to new kernel 2.6.25.10-generic or not?
2008-07-10T05:51:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	use 2.6.24-19-generic
2008-07-10T05:52:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	best way to upgrade to 2.6.24-19?
2008-07-10T05:52:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	should simply ask to do it for you
2008-07-10T06:48:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	none is usually needed
2008-07-10T06:49:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	might be me but ur replies are a bit cryptic.
2008-07-10T06:53:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	it happens automagically for everybody else
2008-07-10T06:55:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	i did upgrade to stable hardy when it came out but a few weeks ago, downloaded updates and my Atheros AR5212 card stopped working.
2008-07-10T06:58:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	you need "main" and "restricted" too
2008-07-10T07:38:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	is it built-in?
2008-07-10T07:38:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	yes
2008-07-10T07:39:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	there might be a switch or button for it
2008-07-10T07:43:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	i wouldnt call it too "screwed up" ;)
2008-07-10T09:12:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	i do hope you mean all _official_ repositories
2008-07-10T09:12:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	yes
2008-07-10T09:13:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	i'm looking for old headers which are not in the current repository : version 2.6.22-14-generic.
2008-07-10T09:13:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	that's the kernel for gutsy 7.10 -- don't use it on hardy
2008-07-10T09:13:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	i'm current runnig that version.
2008-07-10T09:19:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	you don't -- they're all in the kernel pkgs
2008-07-10T09:25:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	in the time you've spent here, you could have reinstalled from scratch and restored all your data
2008-07-10T09:26:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	madwifi is preinstalled by default
2008-07-10T09:26:00.000Z	jm2k	sn9_	true but i also want to learn ;) i just havent followed directions appropriately earlier today.
2008-07-10T09:28:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	don't do that
2008-07-10T09:39:00.000Z	sn9_	jm2k	don't test it
