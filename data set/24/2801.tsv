2009-08-29T22:27:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	we here you - what is your problem?
2011-10-17T22:45:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	I was not able to read your problem - please state it again, all in *one line*
2011-10-17T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	"it won't work" .. are you able to create the link?
2011-10-17T22:52:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	I send things to the shortcut but when I access the folder in windows its empty. If I send it to mnt,hgfs, vmshared folder its there and I can access it in windows.
2011-10-17T22:53:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	when you access this shortcut - are the files you put there from windows (or via vmshared folder) visible?
2011-10-17T22:54:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	I will test this k
2011-10-17T23:02:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	please don't write - at the end of my nick, my client doesn't alert me that you said something :-)
2011-10-17T23:03:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	how did you create that "shortcut"?
2011-10-17T23:03:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	is this working?
2011-10-17T23:03:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	yes:)
2011-10-17T23:03:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	right click copy to desktop
2011-10-17T23:04:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	not sure what create link is but it won't work anyways. I tried that option
2011-10-17T23:04:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	I see .. copy is a one time thing, there is no live connection, that is what links are for
2011-10-17T23:06:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	make a link is blacked out and not an option
2011-10-17T23:07:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	open a terminal, type: cd Desktop          and then: ln -s /mnt/hgfs/vm<tab> shared,   that should create a link, try to use it
2011-10-17T23:11:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	that seem to work but when I delete the files I sent using windows it doesn't show them deleted when i open the folder on ubuntu
2011-10-17T23:13:00.000Z	guntbert	user__	I have the feeling that there is something in the way vmware creates the shared folders (about which I know nothing), but please !pastebin the output of ls -l Desktop/shared  (if you created it like I suggested)
2011-10-17T23:14:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	what do you mean pastebin?
2011-10-17T23:14:00.000Z	user__	guntbert	i did what you said and it worked. you are the man
