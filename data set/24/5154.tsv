2007-02-15T08:49:00.000Z	rpc		does anyone know why mysql doesn't like my tunneled connection? can it see the difference between real localhost connect and tunneled one?
2007-02-15T08:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	only the authentication is different
2007-02-16T11:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	DMA ?
2007-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	do i need to set it up for sata manually?
2007-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	nope - sata is dma enabled by default
2007-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	how full are these drives?
2007-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	hmm what else could i check?
2007-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	setting block sizes when you create the file system can help, but not 5x worth
2007-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	the drive has more than 170GB free space but it always was like that, nothing that it got slower lately
2007-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	check for badness in /var/log/messages.3.gz
2007-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	check for badness in /var/log/messages
2007-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	ok will try
2007-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	i see no badness in message
2007-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	what's your cpu ?
2007-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	that box got X2 4600+
2007-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	if you run 'vmstat 5' & leave it a 20 secs - do you see '0' in the 'b' column or larger numbers ?
2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	oh let me try, sounds interesting
2007-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	0-0-0-1-0-0
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	and even more 0s now...
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	0 is good
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	i will remember that :) what does it tell about btw?
2007-02-16T11:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	that's the number of processes blocked waiting io
2007-02-16T11:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rpc	it's possible your puter was doing something else - try copying again, & run vmstat at the same time
2007-02-16T11:52:00.000Z	rpc	Frogzoo	oh i read you
