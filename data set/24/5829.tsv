2006-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	Android_D		can anyone recommend a webcam app? I am looking at a list of them and trying to determine which I should use.
2006-05-05T10:13:00.000Z	Android_D		preferably one with a GUI
2006-05-05T10:14:00.000Z	Android_D		but thats just for chat, right?
2006-05-05T10:15:00.000Z	Android_D		I want one for motion capturing, I am going to be documention the behaviour of a rat, and I want to record his movement
2006-05-05T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	something special about this rat?
2006-05-05T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	tracking movements is not easy to do
2006-05-05T10:16:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	there are several programs for it
2006-05-05T10:17:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	yes, I know, but I'm not that impressed with them.  are you?
2006-05-05T10:17:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	I am not sure yet. hence why I am asking which I should try out
2006-05-05T10:17:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	thinking about CamStream
2006-05-05T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	I haven't looked at them for some time.  A scientist I know asked me to look into it but that sort of information gets stale very quickly
2006-05-05T10:20:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	have you heard of ZoneMinder?
2006-05-05T10:20:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	no.  have a URL?
2006-05-05T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	that's going to give you series of images, but it isn't going to do any analysis for you.
2006-05-05T10:22:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	what do you mean by analysis?
2006-05-05T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	figuring out the movements, not just capturing the images
2006-05-05T10:23:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	well, I don't mind if it is not motion detective. just as long as I can record the rat while I am away, and then review the video at a later time
2006-05-05T10:23:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	for that it looks very good, from reading a bit here.
2006-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	such files should be too large would they?
2006-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	depends of course on the resolution.  there is a huge range
2006-05-05T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	for low res the space should be manageable.
2006-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	it depends on how sophisticated the system is, whether it uses some intelligent compression and manages to save the differences, rather than always saving entire images.
2006-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	Android_D	sethk	well, only one way to find out
2006-05-05T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	Android_D	yes, go for it
