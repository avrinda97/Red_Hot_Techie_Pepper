2009-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	are you running Ubuntu in a virtual machine?
2009-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	i have set the edit connection too many times... with no luck
2009-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	no
2009-04-28T04:30:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	its on a laptop
2009-04-28T04:30:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	you're sharing a connection through another box running XP
2009-04-28T04:30:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	yes i m using that xp machine to type this
2009-04-28T04:31:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	just a few houirs ago i was on the internet from the laptop using 8.10
2009-04-28T04:32:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	your Ubuntu install should just be DHCP, your XP machine, if configured correctly, should give your Ubuntu box an IP, it sounds like the XP machine isn't set up properly: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306126
2009-04-28T04:32:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	i had changed from dhcp to static
2009-04-28T04:32:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	i did that coz that s what i had done in 8.10
2009-04-28T04:33:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	I haven't done network connection sharing in XP in a while, I don't remember exactly.
2009-04-28T04:33:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	ok thanks anyways
2009-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	DHCP should work on your Ubuntu provided the XP sharing is correct.
2009-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	do you mean automatic dhcp
2009-04-28T04:34:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	yeah.
2009-04-28T04:35:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	h00k	i changed it back to auto dhcp by right clicking the network icon in the taskbar... do i need to do it elsewhere too>
2009-04-28T04:36:00.000Z	h00k	mib_mmx8vt14	no, that's it
