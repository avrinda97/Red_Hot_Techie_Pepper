2006-03-08T17:12:00.000Z	majd		what's a good folder to install all my programs to?
2006-03-08T17:12:00.000Z	soundray	majd	your question doesn't make very much sense in ubuntu. Are you talking about programs you've written?
2006-03-08T17:13:00.000Z	majd	soundray	no, just programs off the internet
2006-03-08T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	majd	first, try to find the software you need in the ubuntu repositories. They'll give you the least trouble.
2006-03-08T17:14:00.000Z	soundray	majd	if you do have to get something that isn't an ubuntu package, the best base directory to put it in is /usr/local/
2006-03-08T17:14:00.000Z	majd	soundray	i'm installing Zend studio
2006-03-08T17:18:00.000Z	majd	soundray	i'm installing zend through it's installer (.bin), it tells me i don't have premissions to /usr/local/    do i need to run it differently?
2006-03-08T17:18:00.000Z	soundray	majd	call the installer with sudo
2006-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	majd	soundray	sudo ZendStudio-5_1_0.bin
2006-03-08T17:19:00.000Z	soundray	majd	should work.
2006-03-11T07:13:00.000Z	majd	soundray	sounds like a gay bar's name
2006-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	soundray	majd	lots of unix command names sound... strange. wine; talk; touch; unzip; touch; strip; gasp; finger; gasp; mount; fsck; more; yes; gasp; umount; make clean; sleep
2006-03-11T07:19:00.000Z	majd	soundray	lmao.....umount
2006-03-29T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	majd	k3b may do it for you.
2006-03-29T14:00:00.000Z	majd	soundray	it won't
2006-03-29T14:01:00.000Z	majd	soundray	"Only MPEG1 and MPEG2 video files are supported."
2006-03-29T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	majd	apt-cache search vcd throws up a few things, most importantly vcdtools and vcdimager. You may need transcode, too.
2006-03-29T14:18:00.000Z	soundray	majd	you mean a standalone one? Some do, some don't.
2006-03-29T14:19:00.000Z	majd	soundray	yeah, a portable one
2007-05-04T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	majd	rm -rf
2007-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	soundray	majd	not really. This kind of mistake is a killer most of the time.
2007-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	majd	soundray	oh thank god...i didn't run it in sudo
2007-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	soundray	majd	in that case, it will probably only have modified the files in your home directory (and possibly some in temp dirs)
2007-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	majd	soundray	so i'm safe?
