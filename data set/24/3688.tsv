2010-09-09T22:15:00.000Z	mark_		OK kagat, is that something that is done on the command line for grep?
2010-09-09T22:15:00.000Z	mark_		If so, any idea how?
2010-09-09T22:17:00.000Z	mark_		Also, kagat, do you know if that grep method will search for DOCs & ODTs too?
2010-09-09T22:18:00.000Z	mark_		OK then, it's probably not something I'd use for this.
2010-09-09T22:19:00.000Z	mark_		Yup, from what I understand grep won't search PDFs & DOCs.  So it looks like the Tracker Search Tool is appropriate.
2010-09-09T22:20:00.000Z	mark_		Which leads me to the question.  Do you know if multiple words can be search with tracker?  It finds single words, but when I type two or more that I know exist in a PDF or plain text file it doesn't find them.
2010-09-09T22:21:00.000Z	mark_		Also, has anyone heard anything about the reliability of Metatracker Search Tool, because it seems it doesn't locate all information in these files.
2010-09-09T22:23:00.000Z	mark_		Does anyone know if it is within the ability of the Tracker Search Tool in Ubuntu 10.4 to search for a string of words in a regular text file?
2010-09-09T22:24:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	The trackerd in Ubuntu is sloppy.  It might work, but don't assume that it is reliable.
2010-09-09T22:25:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Just try it.
2010-09-09T22:26:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Okay, then use something else like `grep` or the Google Desktop (if it still exists).
2010-09-09T22:27:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	If the basic tools don't work, then you need to learn how to combine grep with tools to unpack things like ODF and DOC.
2010-09-09T22:29:00.000Z	mark_	dajhorn	according to various folks that I've asked in this & other chat rooms, it is beyond the ability of grep to search ODT & DOC files, although it may have a limited ability to search the contents of PDFs.  Is this incorrect?
2010-09-09T22:30:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Yes.
2010-09-09T22:32:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	 Learning to use the userland will cost you tens of hours of learning.  Try this:  http://desktop.google.com/linux/
2010-09-09T22:33:00.000Z	mark_	dajhorn	I don't mind that, & would even prefer to become familiar with the command line searching method, if it can be accomplished in this manner.
2010-09-09T22:34:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Okay, there are several packages in Ubuntu that can dump Word files to plain text.  Choose one, and then learn how to use the `find /home -name \*.doc -print0 | xargs -n0 MyProgram` way of doing things.
2011-04-08T22:46:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	 Post the manufacturer and model of the computer when you ask a hardware question.  You're more likely to get an answer if you do.
2011-04-08T22:47:00.000Z	mark_	dajhorn	i have a Acer Aspire timeline X 5820tg 6406, with an ATI radeon HD 6550m.
2011-04-08T22:50:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Go to ubuntuforums.org and search for the model number.  Somebody has posted a script.
2011-04-08T22:50:00.000Z	mark_	dajhorn	thanks i will!
2011-04-08T22:50:00.000Z	dajhorn	mark_	Welcome.

2011-04-08T22:53:00.000Z	mark_	dajhorn	thanks again, but i can't find that thread you are talking of.
