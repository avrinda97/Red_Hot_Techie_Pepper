2007-07-31T16:51:00.000Z	needhelp		Hi, have trouble getting the printer (HP Deskjet 3940) to work. Clicking System->Admin->Printing->New Printer: no printers detected. The printer is connected to USB and power is on. What else could be wrong ?

2007-07-31T05:23:00.000Z	jvai	needhelp	did u select "local printer"? it may default to network printer
2007-07-31T05:24:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	yes, "Local or Detected Printer", but Next-button in the wizard is disabled because there are no detected printers.
2007-07-31T05:26:00.000Z	jvai	needhelp	did u slect the drivers for that printer? it may be in the printer app, but you'll need to "awaken" the drivers, they wont automatically
2007-07-31T05:27:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	dunno... where can I check for that?
2007-07-31T05:28:00.000Z	jvai		when u add new printer, there 1 of 3 steps
2007-07-31T05:28:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	yes, Im at Step 1
2007-07-31T05:29:00.000Z	jvai		ok... do the rest u have to look @ add what printer u have
2007-07-31T05:31:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	I can choose between "Local or Detected Printer", Networkprinter, use a detected printer (empty list), or enter a port manually. I cant click the Next-button, it is disabled until I can choose a detected printer. But it doesnt detect anything, therefore I'm stuck at Step1, cant go to step2...
2007-07-31T05:32:00.000Z	jvai		ok @ needhelp select "forward
2007-07-31T05:32:00.000Z	jvai		then @ needhelp select your printer
2007-07-31T05:32:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	Button is disabled. Only Cancel-button is enabled...
2007-07-31T05:33:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	there is no printer in the list to select from
2007-07-31T05:33:00.000Z	jvai	needhelp	the forward button is greyed out? did u select local printer?
2007-07-31T05:34:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	yes to both questions
2007-07-31T05:34:00.000Z	jvai		?????
2007-07-31T05:35:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	the reason is that it is unable to detect the printer
2007-07-31T05:36:00.000Z	jvai		well it isnt neccesary to detect the printer before loading the drivers @ needhelp , it needs the drivers 1st
2007-07-31T05:36:00.000Z	jvai		then it will detect the printer
2007-07-31T05:36:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	but how can I load the driver without using the Printer Connection-wizard ?
2007-07-31T05:36:00.000Z	jvai		select "use another printer by specifying a port" @ needhelp
2007-07-31T05:37:00.000Z	jvai		then "forward should be selectable
2007-07-31T05:37:00.000Z	needhelp	jvai	No, no matter which of the four options I select, Forward-button still disabled
