2011-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	plotino		maybe it's better to downgrade to gnome2
2011-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	plotino		ubottu
2011-11-07T15:53:00.000Z	plotino		now im out of internet
2011-11-07T15:54:00.000Z	plotino		it's possible to install the gnome-shell
2011-11-07T15:54:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Bring the network up via the command line
2011-11-07T16:00:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	What does "ifconfig" show?
2011-11-07T16:00:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Oh, okay. Run this: echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
2011-11-07T16:02:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Would you run that command I gave and try again?
2011-11-07T16:04:00.000Z	plotino	theadmin	ifconfig?
2011-11-07T16:04:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
2011-11-07T16:06:00.000Z	plotino	theadmin	thanks
2011-11-07T16:06:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Hey no problem, GLaD to help
2011-11-07T16:06:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	The secret? We just set your nameserver to Google's public DNS
2011-11-07T16:06:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	You could as well have ran "sudo dhcpcd" to set it to your ISP's nameservers I suppose.
2011-11-07T16:07:00.000Z	plotino	theadmin	why my usual DNS didnt work?
2011-11-07T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Yeah, could be they're down, or it wasn't set, or who knows what
2011-11-07T16:10:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	Possibly not, networkmanager doesn't care for resolv.conf
2011-11-07T16:11:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	I suggest you go with xfce if you liked gnome2
2011-11-07T17:06:00.000Z	theadmin	plotino	You can't, gnome2 is no longer supported
