2004-11-11T09:39:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	what the hell is that?
2004-11-11T09:39:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	a discussion on the topic you just asked about?
2004-11-11T09:40:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	no, some spyware scan???
2004-11-11T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	huh?
2004-11-11T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	what broweser are you using?
2004-11-11T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	it's just a normal web page here
2004-11-11T09:41:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	oh sorry, i thought you typoed sourceforge wrong and put soureforge instead of sourcefrog and it comes up with a page that doesn't look like its friendly
2004-11-11T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	right
2004-11-11T09:41:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	sourcefrog works fine
2004-11-11T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	it's a pun on sourceforge, I guess
2004-11-11T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	cool
2004-11-15T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	no it's not
2004-11-15T09:15:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	man, i must be dislexic.. if i could spell it
2004-11-22T17:07:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	it depends what program you're using
2004-11-22T17:08:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	it was a download from firefox that I let go over night, was supposed to be 2.5GB but it cut off at exacly 2GB
2004-11-22T17:09:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	does it make sense that firefox cut it off?
2004-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	I'd have thought firefox would support large files
2004-11-22T17:11:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	you could use wget -c on it
2004-11-22T17:12:00.000Z	cuga	bob2	yeah i just read up on it, it is firefox's problem :( night of downloading down the crapper
2004-11-22T17:14:00.000Z	bob2	cuga	you can use wget to resume it
