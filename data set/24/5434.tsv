2006-12-05T13:14:00.000Z	kevin_		where can I get chromium BSU?
2006-12-05T13:14:00.000Z	kevin_		the site is got a problem with it
2006-12-05T13:16:00.000Z	kevin_		is the cpu good?
2006-12-05T13:17:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	I'm "assuming" so. I don't have another to test it with (PII) .. think I might just see if anyone around here is tossing out an old computer (I like using old computers as my servers) ..
2006-12-05T13:18:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	It did just spend three days in my luggage .. lol .. could'a snapped something in the old cpu connection (it stands up on it's side) ..
2006-12-05T13:18:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	I've had good experiences with P2s and 3s
2006-12-05T13:19:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	I dont' think that it's bad
2006-12-05T13:19:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	ditto .. they seem to handle the few web sites I run, and toss around files in the house along with handeling the printer duties .. all goes well ..
2006-12-05T13:20:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	I had it in the static bag .. hopefully that was enough ..
2006-12-05T13:20:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	it should be
2006-12-05T13:20:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	is it the exact same as the one that was in previously?
2006-12-05T13:20:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	mhz and all that?
2006-12-05T13:21:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	you might have to set the timing on the mobo manually
2006-12-05T13:21:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	I had to do that to mine
2006-12-05T13:22:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	naw, this bobo/cpu/ram is all out of another box.
2006-12-05T13:22:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	 I can't even get to the bios screen ..
2006-12-05T13:22:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	 and you did clear the cmos, right?
2006-12-05T13:23:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	what about a bad floppy drive?
2006-12-05T13:23:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	I can't find the bios jumpers so I pulled the battery for 15-20 minutes .. I think I found the cmos jumpers and moved the jumper back and forth (it's right next to the jumpers for front panel USB) ..
2006-12-05T13:23:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	no floppy installed ..
2006-12-05T13:24:00.000Z	kevin_	NineTeen67Comet	 try taking the battery out and then taking the power cord out, then pressing the power button and that might clear any static charges
2006-12-05T13:25:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	Okay .. I'll give that'n a try .. (both) ..
2006-12-05T13:36:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	thanks much for your help .. I did get a reset bios password screen for a second, but I hadn't hooked up the keyboard, and when I shut it down and brought it back it stuck again at the initial screen .. no biggie, off to finish unpacking . thanks again ..
2006-12-05T13:37:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	kevin_	well I've got the softstuff in the *nix world working well (I have to fumble but I figure it out) .. take care ..
