2008-05-14T03:57:00.000Z	linkmaster03		I cannot use "java" as a command in my terminal, even though I have JRE installed... Java applets in Firefox work fine, what's wrong?
2008-05-14T03:58:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	prolly your path, check if the binarys are in your path
2008-05-14T04:00:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	i found the binary, but the link is broken. where should it go to?
2008-05-14T04:01:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	mine is linked to /etc/alternatives/java
2008-05-14T04:01:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	same here :( what should I change and how?
2008-05-14T04:01:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	which java package did you install?
2008-05-14T04:02:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	i have icedtea and jre6
2008-05-14T04:03:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	java worked before upgrading gutsy 7.10 to hardy
2008-05-14T04:04:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	if you did an upgrade, might wanna try just purge and reinstall
2008-05-14T04:04:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	might be faster than searching
2008-05-14T04:04:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	which should I use, the official JRE or IcedTea?
2008-05-14T04:06:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	sorry, I'm a coder so I always install the sun bins
2008-05-14T04:06:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	I've never tried icedtea
2008-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	ok thanks, I found the problem btw. How do I change a symbolic link?
2008-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	thanks
2008-05-14T04:08:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	np, you'll have to sudo that too
2008-05-14T04:10:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	when using ln -s what's the first path to?
2008-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	that you called the proper path?
2008-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	the target of the link
2008-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	you said you found your java binary rite?
2008-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	and the second path is what? /usr/bin/java no matter what?
2008-05-14T04:11:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	yes
2008-05-14T04:12:00.000Z	Nith	linkmaster03	the first path should be to the location of the java bin
2008-05-14T04:12:00.000Z	linkmaster03	Nith	thanks for your time bro, got it working :)
