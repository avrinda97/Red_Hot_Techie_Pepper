2005-08-09T07:01:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		Most advanced language I learned was MS VB.Net

2005-08-09T07:03:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		That's low?
2005-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		1024x768 is elite.
2005-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		anything higher hurts my eyes.
2005-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	Chaotic_Shield	what size monitor you use?
2005-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		13" LCD I think.
2005-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		It's a laptop.
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		So whatever's attached to it
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Gorgonzola	Chaotic_Shield	that's probably why then :)
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		It maxes out at 1024x768./
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Gorgonzola		on a 17" 1280x960 is fine for me
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		I have a 20" I put at 1600x1200 and it's so freakin tiny.
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		I HATE that.
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		I'm Canadian, and colour > color.
2005-08-09T07:05:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		honestly.
2005-08-09T07:06:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield		Why can't HTML be Canadian/British English compatible?
2005-08-09T07:06:00.000Z	Gorgonzola		even at 1024x768 everything in ubuntu (menus and stuff) just seem so much bigger than winxp.... or is that just my imagination (and im not used to running a slightly lower res)?
2005-08-09T07:06:00.000Z	Chaotic_Shield	Gorgonzola	it's you.
