2008-09-01T02:07:00.000Z	Kai_wp		I've determined that Xine is making it so that I can't play MP3s. Is it ok to uninstall Xine and it's related packages? Or is Xine a nessicary package?
2008-09-01T02:08:00.000Z	Kai_wp		I can safely uninstall Xine right?
2008-09-01T02:08:00.000Z	Kai_wp		Or can it cause problems?
2008-09-01T02:09:00.000Z	Kai_wp		Since I was going to try to uninstall it and it's related packages.
2008-09-01T02:09:00.000Z	Kai_wp		But I'm not sure if it'll cause problems.

2009-04-22T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kai_wp	if they gain you nothing after restarting X, delete them out
2009-04-22T14:48:00.000Z	Kai_wp	ActionParsnip	Alright I'm trying adding those lines to my xorg.conf file now. Should I do a full reboot after or?
2009-04-22T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kai_wp	no, simply save the file, close the editor then hit ctrl+alt+backspace once it is safe to log you out
2009-04-22T14:51:00.000Z	Kai_wp	ActionParsnip	Um, as bizarre as it is, CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE does absolutely nothing. O_o
2009-04-22T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kai_wp	are you running jaunty?
2009-04-22T14:52:00.000Z	Kai_wp	ActionParsnip	Ya, the latest release candidate.
2009-04-22T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kai_wp	then reboot
2009-04-22T14:52:00.000Z	Kai_wp	ActionParsnip	Ok
2009-04-22T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kai_wp	you can re-enable ctrl+alt+ackspace
2009-04-22T14:55:00.000Z	Kai_wp	ActionParsnip	I'll have to try the changes I made to the xorg.conf file out tommorow. XD Thanks for the help! :D
