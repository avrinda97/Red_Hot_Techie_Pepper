2009-01-09T04:25:00.000Z	owh		Under gutsy I could run two monitors independently. Under intrepid I cannot. How do I get that behaviour back? I've googled for days and still have no solution. It looks like Gnome is "helping" to manage the monitors because xorg sees them as separate screens.
2009-01-09T04:26:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	go to system --> preferences --> screen resolution
2009-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	click on your screen it should show both screens then
2009-01-09T04:28:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	did you click detect screens
2009-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	and then click apply
2009-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	Yes
2009-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	then log out and back in
2009-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	I had the same problem yesterday
2009-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	On an Intel graphic card?
2009-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	Yes I have a toshiba laptop that I use with dual screen
2009-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	with a intel chip
2009-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	What did the "Detect Screens" do for you, there was no feedback.
2009-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	does it show to seperate screens?
2009-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	Yes.
2009-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	and you want them to be the same desktop on both so you can drag apps to the other desktop?
2009-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	No, that's what I have, I *hate* it.
2009-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	you also need to set the resolution for the different screens
2009-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	My productivity has gone through the floor. I went from 16 desktops to 8.
2009-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	so you want them to be the same like a desktop on each
2009-01-09T04:33:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	so the menu bars are on both?
2009-01-09T04:33:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	No, there are three options. 1. Mirror, two identical screens. 2. One large desktop, what I have. 3. Two different separate screens. What I had and want back.
2009-01-09T04:34:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	oh ok I see what you mean
2009-01-09T04:34:00.000Z	roccity_	owh	sorry misunderstood
2009-01-09T04:35:00.000Z	owh	roccity_	No, that's OK, the issue is that every card manufacturer calls it something different, most people wouldn't want two screens.
