2010-01-25T12:59:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	That's normal. is your only problem centered around rebooting?
2010-01-25T12:59:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	or are you having problems booting into your system as well?
2010-01-25T13:04:00.000Z	RaiN88	BinaryMan	what will I do? :(
2010-01-25T13:05:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	you need to listen to us and give us clear responses.
2010-01-25T13:06:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	You said that when you reboot, you have a black screen and your computer sits there. is that your only problem.
2010-01-25T13:07:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	do you have any problems booting into your system?
2010-01-25T13:07:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	Are you booted into your system right now?
2010-01-25T13:08:00.000Z	BinaryMan	RaiN88	Alright. That shouldn't be a problem.
