2006-04-27T07:57:00.000Z	chiche		o+x etc.
2006-04-27T07:58:00.000Z	chiche		is sudo safe?
2006-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	chiche		(hehe)
2006-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	for what exactlt? Giving to a script kiddy? no
2006-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	hahaha
2006-04-27T08:07:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	That is not the UNIX way. Use external players for playing movies and music. Use external download managers, etc. like Epiphany does. 1 program does 1 task REALLY WELL
2006-04-27T08:08:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	It is part of GNOME, I use it
2006-04-27T08:09:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	not always...
2006-04-27T08:10:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	example? Here's one. File Roller does 1 thing. It controls archivers. Each archiver supports one archive type
2006-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	so?
2006-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	Just saying, that gives you a more stable, expandable system
2006-04-27T08:11:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	I doubt
2006-04-27T08:12:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	It does. If you want a better example, then you don't have to redownload TONS of programs if a major error is found in gzip (as gzip is the only gzip program)
2006-04-27T08:13:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	How many archivers are there for Windows on Download.com? Loads. Why? Because each tries to do everything and fails
2006-04-27T08:15:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	not really, for instance, mozilla > ff for me
2006-04-27T08:26:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	that's not the fault of XFCE
2006-04-27T08:27:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	if possible, I wanted a gtk/qt-free os
2006-04-27T08:30:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	There is a meta theme thing being worked on by SymphonyOS guys which applies the same theme to GTK and QT. QT has a basic GTK pixmap thing and I have a QT theme "Polymer" installed which does something similar. You need one kind of Widget set, even if it's MUI or something
2006-04-27T08:31:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	I know what the x-window programming are...
2006-04-27T08:32:00.000Z	chiche	Warbo	it's a common sense for a long time...
2006-04-27T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	I always try to correct people when they say "Windows can use my device" to "Your device can use Windows" because a bare windows box would be pretty useless. Take the install CDs from all of the hardware out there and you see how good Linux driver support is
2006-04-27T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	I have a dongle which just works
2006-04-27T08:53:00.000Z	Warbo	chiche	I bound my phone to a serial port and dialed a pay-as-you-go ISP. It wasted all of my credit
