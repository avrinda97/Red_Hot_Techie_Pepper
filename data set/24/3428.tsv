2008-01-25T01:00:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		Guys - when trying to use package manager I get loads of what looks like repo errors. How do I update my repos (I think this is what the problem is)?
2008-01-25T01:00:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	sudo apt-get update
2008-01-25T01:01:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- it comes back with 302 Found errors - any ideas?
2008-01-25T01:02:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	what does it say exactly?
2008-01-25T01:02:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	please paste the output to pastebin
2008-01-25T01:02:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- fairly new - please bear with me
2008-01-25T01:03:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	np
2008-01-25T01:05:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- can you see this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53369/
2008-01-25T01:05:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	2 secs
2008-01-25T01:06:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- np
2008-01-25T01:07:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	are the fesity repos still going for medibuntu?
2008-01-25T01:07:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- I'm not sure to be honest. I'd need to check
2008-01-25T01:09:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	I'm pretty sure medi gives errors anyway about the key but it should still hit when updating
2008-01-25T01:10:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	sorry I couldn't be of more help ;)
2008-01-25T01:10:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	and the solution?!
2008-01-25T01:11:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	k3zo	- hashed out the lines that were erroring in the apt-get update command
2008-01-25T01:11:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	commeting out will cease future errors but also mean updates are halted too.
2008-01-25T01:11:00.000Z	k3zo	TurtleBoots	(as far as i'm aware)
