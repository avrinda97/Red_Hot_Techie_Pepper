2012-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	chipotle		hi, i am trying to setup ubuntu, and i have 5 hdd's installed. i would like to use the 750gb drive like this: partition 1: 100gb / ext3, partition 2: 100gb ntfs for windows 7 dual boot and the rest for /home. then the rest of the drives, i want to use to store media on them (this is a file server)
2012-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	chipotle		so what should i do?
2012-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	I would put wundows first on the drive.
2012-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	any reason for ext3
2012-02-24T08:51:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	well, what are you recommending?
2012-02-24T08:51:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	ext3 is okay the default is ext4 in ubuntu
2012-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	well, the point was so windows could view the partition and i don't know if it can read+write ext4, but it can ext3
2012-02-24T08:53:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	on this channel and in general a shared ntfs is preferred.
2012-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	so, should i just partition the one drive right now, the 750gb and then come back to the four other drives at a later date?
2012-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	all I would recommend is windows first on any of the drives it is easier to repair this way, and a shred ntfs wherever you want and the ubuntu where ever you want.
2012-02-27T09:21:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	ah guid your on your own there I have no clue.
2012-02-27T09:20:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	sure you will have to reload the mbr though to get grub.
2012-02-27T09:22:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	so i should select mbr and not guid when creating a partition type?
2012-02-27T09:22:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	I have never had a GUID set up not sure really.
2012-02-27T09:22:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	toafan ^ i will use ntfs for win7, i guess
2012-02-28T10:43:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	msdos
2012-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	you want grub to be the boot?
2012-02-28T10:45:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	well, right now i get an intiramfs command when i try to boot into linux
2012-02-28T10:46:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	so you have a actual boot partition?
2012-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	yes
2012-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	it is not just the root partition with a split home from it?
2012-02-28T10:47:00.000Z	chipotle	urfr332gO	no
2012-02-28T10:48:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	you don't need a bootpartition with your setup
2012-02-28T10:48:00.000Z	urfr332gO	chipotle	I can't really help there.
