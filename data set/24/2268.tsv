2009-02-17T02:10:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	what's up with wine ?
2009-02-17T02:11:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	well it runs well despite the fact that i can't read anything
2009-02-17T02:11:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	does ur nick comes from the company for boots
2009-02-17T02:12:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	what gpu do you have ? if nvidia, are the drivers you use the Nvidia v96 ? (my nick has a lot of origins, but not this one ;) )
2009-02-17T02:13:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	how to check if my driver is v96
2009-02-17T02:13:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	: i suppose it is the latest
2009-02-17T02:13:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	go to "drivers of peripherals", the version is written. What graphic card do you have ? An old nvidia, right ? (or an old intel ? )
2009-02-17T02:14:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	i cant see drivers of periphals anywhere
2009-02-17T02:16:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	what now when it's v96
2009-02-17T02:16:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	i'm trying to find back a bug entry i saw about it, give me a minute
2009-02-17T02:17:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	those drivers havea bug with font antialiasing functions, i'm trying to find out how to disable it in wine.
2009-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	see also : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-96/+bug/294076 for openoffice, k3b, opera, and all qt apps. There is a fix for all apps on second link
2009-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	do u think that will help
2009-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	SiDi	merl1n	i don't think it will, i know it will :) i already had 3/4 people with the same bug and same drivers ;)
2009-02-17T02:19:00.000Z	merl1n	SiDi	tnx alot man
