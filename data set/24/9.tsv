2004-12-03T08:16:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	end of december (but that may change)
2004-12-04T09:56:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	surely there'd be thousands of users complaining if it's removed?
2004-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	somehow i don't think so :)
2004-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	do you know if anyone is working on a gnome nx client?
2004-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	nup, haven't heard
2004-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	ok, I just thought it might be useful, since the libs are available under the GPL
2004-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	it'd be g-rad
2004-12-05T09:27:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	how about broken usb with 2.6?
2004-12-05T09:28:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	it's not *that* broken ;)
2004-12-05T09:28:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	on this box I have here, it seems quite broken :)

2004-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	btw, how often do you sync from sid at the moment?
2004-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	AS FAST AS WE CAN
2004-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	daily, i think

2004-12-11T08:30:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	all source packages imported are built for universe, or not?
2004-12-11T08:31:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	we bring in source; everything is built against ubuntu
2004-12-11T08:31:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	alright, I just noticed some warty packages that only had source, no binaries
2004-12-11T08:32:00.000Z	jdub	ajmitch_	build failures, here are the logs:
2004-12-11T08:33:00.000Z	ajmitch_	jdub	thanks..
