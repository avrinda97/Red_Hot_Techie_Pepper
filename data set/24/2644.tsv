2008-10-09T20:20:00.000Z	smoovep		Question: apache2 error.log shows sendmail: not found .. when using php script.. sendmail works fine from the command line..
2008-10-09T20:20:00.000Z	smoovep		its define in php.ini as 'sendmail' ..
2008-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	smoovep		still cannot get php script to send email ..
2008-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	smoovep		any ideas?
2008-10-09T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	i think theres a phpmail package, have you tried #php
2008-10-09T20:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	i have a misty memory about it
2008-10-09T20:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	ive never needed that so i wouldnt know
2008-10-23T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	roundcube?
2008-10-23T01:32:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	Yep, RoundCube for Webmail .. all emails going out shows up as localhost.mydomain.com.. if i send a client.. its fine..
2008-10-23T01:33:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	that makes not sense.. OK .. if i use RoundCube webmail to send email, it shows up as me@localhost.mydoamin.com .. if i use a email client software, it shows up as me@mydomain.com
2008-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	dude this thing looks awesome
2008-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	it works.. well up until this morning.. the config fill looks fine..
2008-10-23T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	so am i right in thinking it is an email client with a web based interface?
2008-10-23T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	is that correct or am i readnig this wrong?
2008-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	its Webmail Client.. it's basically PHP scripts that attach to your already existing mail server...
2008-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	Its a cool software.. you need LAMP installed and the RoundCube php files..
2008-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	im trying to run a headless pc and if i can access my locally stored mails via web page then sweet
2008-10-23T01:39:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	Headless.. that sounds fun... PXE boot ?? yep.. i have a few here cause the workstations is dog old..
2008-10-23T01:41:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	Question, if my PXE Boot machines started preforming like crap.. is it the local hardware or the host? thnx
2008-10-23T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	possibly the lan
2008-10-23T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	try pinging across to check latency
2008-10-23T01:42:00.000Z	smoovep	ActionParsnip	Its only 5 users on Gbit LAN Switches.. hmmm.. i think the term server needs a kick.. i'll do this later tonight..
2008-10-23T01:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	sounds like it too
2008-10-23T01:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smoovep	id still check the lan, just for completness
