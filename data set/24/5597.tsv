2007-03-22T08:42:00.000Z	laptop		it says "Totem Mplayer" and it doesnt play.
2007-03-22T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	totem mplayer, some sort of bizarre hybrid?
2007-03-22T08:43:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 perhaps?
2007-03-24T10:21:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	click on that filetype and then when the prompt comes up asking you what to do, tell it
2007-03-24T10:21:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	there is no way to just go into it and add. You have to actually have come upon that filetype before
2007-03-24T10:23:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	I have, repeatedly.
2007-03-24T10:23:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	what filetype are you talking about
2007-03-24T10:23:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	ok and what is the problem
2007-03-24T10:24:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 basically it says "Firefox doesnt know what to do because the protocol rtsp isnt associated with a program"
2007-03-24T10:24:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 no option to choose nothing.
2007-03-24T10:24:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	get mozilla-mplayer
2007-03-24T10:24:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 I have that installed.
2007-03-24T10:24:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	link to such an rtsp
2007-03-24T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	I get a prompt that comes up and tells me it is an external protocol and asks me if I want to open it with totem and whether I want to associate it with totem automatically from now on
2007-03-24T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	do you have totem all codeced ought
2007-03-24T10:27:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 I uninstalled totem
2007-03-24T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	well do you have something that can handle it
2007-03-24T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	oh wow, vomit,
2007-03-24T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	real player is vomit
2007-03-24T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	but anyways, I don't know where firefox is looking to make these decisions, it somehow figured out totem though
2007-03-24T10:28:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	right i uninstalled totem and now it doesnt even give me the option
2007-03-24T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	perhaps if you could get it to hang on to something and then you can edit the preference later after it gets put into the filetype options for your real player
2007-03-24T10:29:00.000Z	laptop	bruenig	 trying, thanks anyway
2007-03-24T12:51:00.000Z	bruenig	laptop	it is not a good idea, I would get the tarball, but alien can try to convert it to deb
