2009-02-21T03:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I have killed my kubunto yesterday. Now I cannot start x session anymore
2009-02-21T03:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_		kunbutnu
2009-02-21T03:39:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	how did you kill it
2009-02-21T03:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	Adept said 39 updates available. I updated. Before that i had installed transmission bittorrent client. Then Adept told me updates sucessful and that there was still an upgrade for xine.
2009-02-21T03:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	I upgrade. Then it told me something like that I have to close KDE, and gave me the option to do so later. i chose to so so later. One by one the icons in K menu went disappearing. I hit shitdown or restart and since then I always end up at a konsole login
2009-02-21T03:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	try this.. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade .. then if you notice that it pulls packages in .. afterwards type sudo reboot now and see if you get it back
2009-02-21T03:42:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	"login:   Stopping NTP                               Startin NTP"  there i add my user name and it asks for pw, and i can log into konsole, but not kde
2009-02-21T03:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	yep.. that's where you can type all that I listed.
2009-02-21T03:43:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	ok, I must write that down. Am right now on a live CD in order to get into irc.
2009-02-21T03:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	If that doesnt' work you could always sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2009-02-21T03:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	One more thing. I had tried startx and got the error: no xsession fiel in /home/user, Xsession file in home user, no session manager found, no window manager found, no terminal emulator found
2009-02-21T03:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	and before I get to console login it says: Kinit no resume image
2009-02-21T03:45:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	the other way to attempt to start x is by typing .. sudo /etc/init.d/kdm start
2009-02-21T03:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	That's all the info i get. Hopefully it tells you something about the reason
2009-02-21T03:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	sounds like you first need to do the updates then maybe sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop.. that will reinstall the entire desktop environment again.. no need to reformat or anything.
2009-02-21T03:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	that's good news, if I don't loose any data then
2009-02-21T03:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	will I have to backup anything?  a had a hell lota notes in tomboy. Will they still be there or should i back em up?
2009-02-21T03:50:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	ok, forat update, upgrade and dist upgrade, then see if it works, if not install kubuntu-desktop. Right?
2009-02-21T03:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	yes..
2009-02-21T03:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	sorry for the many misspellings, am not good in fast typing.   What about backups. Do I need to beackup any folder or will my home and even kde config remain untouched?
2009-02-21T03:52:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu_	your home will remain as well as your user name and password
2009-02-21T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	Thank you. Will try that now.
2009-02-21T03:53:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Izinucs	Thanks for oyur help: )  cya
