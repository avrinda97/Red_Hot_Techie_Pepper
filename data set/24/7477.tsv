2005-07-04T15:34:00.000Z	catch		I'm trying to set up wine, I have an dual boot to windows XP. I'm being told that I need to remove a Resolution line from the config file and edit the registry with an entry about log pixels. Does anyone know what a reasonable value for the log pixels is?
2005-07-04T15:34:00.000Z	catch		google wasn't a lot of help

2005-07-04T15:40:00.000Z	catch		do you guys use a paste bin or anything so i can show you the error message wine is fiving me?
2005-07-04T15:46:00.000Z	catch	yuacht	or holycow : http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/311 is the error I get from wine
2005-07-04T15:47:00.000Z	catch		I get other errors if i try to start other things, I'm wanting, mainly to run picassa but don't have that installed to test with atm, but would also be nice to get other stuff working

2005-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	holycow	catch	i'm sorry i don't know how to regedit a wine install, it sounded when you first described the problem as if someone gave you some deliberately bad advice
