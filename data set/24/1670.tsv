2009-10-12T11:20:00.000Z	lilzeus		checking configuration
2009-10-12T11:21:00.000Z	lilzeus		could someone send me a message here, like "lilzeus: hello"
2009-10-12T11:21:00.000Z	lilzeus		thank you, I am trying to configure pidgin, its not working
2009-10-12T11:22:00.000Z	lilzeus		I think so
2009-10-12T11:22:00.000Z	lilzeus		I want to be able to see when people send me a message
2009-10-12T11:23:00.000Z	lilzeus		ah, ignore incoming format...so all you people who have modified your fonts will be nullified
2009-10-12T11:24:00.000Z	lilzeus		I assume that all the setting for this are in the plugins section?
2009-10-12T11:26:00.000Z	lilzeus		I installed the latest Firefox, only its not called Firefox and the icon associated with it is different, can I change this?
2009-10-12T11:28:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	it's a development version - 3.5 is standard in 9.10; so waiting is best
2009-10-12T11:35:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	we don't care at all - as long as our support doesn't meet a brick wall
2009-10-12T11:36:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	part of the reason for support by commands is variations in how ever you want to set things up - I don't use Gnome or KDE - I can't click through menus to guide you through it - I just check commands
2009-10-12T11:39:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	remember - learning is fun - before you know it you'll be compiling your own kernel ;) - it's what I'm doing nowe
2009-10-12T11:40:00.000Z	lilzeus	MTecknology	wishful thinking :)
2009-10-12T11:41:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	open the menu editor, find the icon firefox is using; then copy that path over to the other
2009-10-12T11:42:00.000Z	lilzeus	MTecknology	ah, duh
2009-10-12T11:43:00.000Z	lilzeus	MTecknology	what is the menu editor?
2009-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	it lets you edit the menu
2009-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	lilzeus	MTecknology	where is it located?
2009-10-12T11:44:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	many places - I don't remember where though
2009-10-12T11:51:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	you click the icon and it's changed - that's it
2009-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	lilzeus	MTecknology	that doesn't appear to happen
2009-10-12T11:58:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	what about it?
2009-10-12T12:06:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	both
2009-10-12T12:14:00.000Z	MTecknology	lilzeus	install ubuntu-restricted-extras - any multimedia will work after that
