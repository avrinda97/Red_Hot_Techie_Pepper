2012-05-02T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	what do you want to do on the remote system once connected?
2012-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	Im trying to get a Remote Desktop in ubuntu, from Win7
2012-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	yes, but to then do what on the remote system?
2012-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	 Its Just a matter of preferences, i can do the same on unity. We just prefer gnome-shell for doing it.
2012-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	you aren't answering the question. Lets say you get connected. What are you going to do on the remote system exactly?
2012-05-02T22:02:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	Im sorry. Just act like im in front of the physical terminal.
2012-05-02T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	yes but to do waht? updates?
2012-05-02T22:03:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	 Erhm.. no, maybe im wrong with something, Just tryng to get Ubuntu acts like a Virtual remote server for some user sessions.
2012-05-02T22:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	but why do they need the full desktop? What are you doing on the desktop exactly?
2012-05-02T22:04:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	I'm sorry, maybe the problem is that english its not my native, so i cant completly understand you.
2012-05-02T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	you get connected successfully (imagine), now what do you need to do on the system?
2012-05-02T22:06:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	The goal is to have A monitor on Windows7  with a session oppened into the ubuntu machine, with remote desktop, so i can do whatever i can ( Except killing X and such) From Windows 7, using the remote desktop.
2012-05-02T22:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	yes but why do you want to see the remote desktop, what are you going to do on the remote system?
2012-05-02T22:08:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	Argh :P  Imagine you are working as usual infront of your ubuntu machine. Well, my goal is to achieve the same, but in a fullscreen remote desktop in Win7. Doing whatever i need to, from edit files, compile, or surf the web xD
2012-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	fine but what apps will you run?
2012-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	you can setup a file share on the system via samba or even sftp and access the files. You can compile via SSH in terminal
2012-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	qEssence	ActionParsnip	Everything, except 3D rendering.
2012-05-02T22:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qEssence	you can launch the browser in the SSH session with X forwarding (install and run xming in Windows) and the browser will run on the remote system but display on the Windows system
