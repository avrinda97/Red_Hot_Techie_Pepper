2008-07-28T13:07:00.000Z	ra21vi_		how to use the jdk installed in my ubuntu to the chrooted environment?>
2008-07-28T13:07:00.000Z	ra21vi_		can I use the same package, or whole distro is reinstalled in chrooted environment
2008-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	are you running debian or ubuntu?
2008-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	i am running ubutnu, and the debootstrap showd manpages examples with debian, so I was asking for latest debin release, not I put there hardy
2008-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	can you help me with this chroot.
2008-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	only if you ask sensible questions or state your problems clearly
2008-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	when did you find I was insensible? and unclear
2008-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	you haven't asked a single specific question about your problem
2008-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	and "can someone help me" without specifics is simply, dumb
2008-07-28T13:14:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	ok, here is the problem scenario...
2008-07-28T13:15:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	I have a Ubuntu Hardy lastest updated system on Intel Core 2 Duo, with 1.23 GB Memory, and it is primarily used for my development work, using Gnome, X, and eclipse... as well as Internet surfing... Now the requirement is to install the jdk, ant and cruise control build system on it as per the project requirement
2008-07-28T13:16:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	so I am configuring a chroot, since I don't want my system be messed with these experiments and people dont come out of chroot
2008-07-28T13:17:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	and the progress till now is: chroot installation in progress, debootstrap is downloading packages
2008-07-28T13:18:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	any comment on previous msg
2008-07-28T13:19:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	yes. state a problem. I doN't see one
2008-07-28T13:19:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	problem still to come, download is in progress.
2008-07-28T13:19:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	i was just thinking, If i can use the jdk preinstalled in ubuntu or i will have to install one in chroot
2008-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	untill you know how to state a specific problem: please don't talk to me anymore cause I don't care what you or your PC are doing right now. thank you.
2008-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	and i figured it out, i will have to install it
2008-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	why are you so rude
2008-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	cause this is a support channel and not a chat channel goodbye
2008-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	and who knows what the specific problem statement means'
2008-07-28T13:21:00.000Z	wols	ra21vi_	it means: I try to do X and when I do Y to accopmlish this I get error Z
2008-07-28T13:21:00.000Z	ra21vi_	wols	and what if i ask, how can I do this, even before I would really do that, thats just curiosity, not getting support.
