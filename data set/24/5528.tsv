2008-02-03T19:22:00.000Z	nathan__		I'm having trouble installing Win98 SE onto a machine with Xubuntu 7.10
2008-02-03T19:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	Instead of repeating the same question, why not explain what the problem is
2008-02-03T19:24:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	It loads the setup off of the cd, but at random times through the setup it gives an insufficient memory error
2008-02-03T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	How are you trying to install it? to the hard drive or some sort of virtual..
2008-02-03T19:26:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	To the hard drive. I spent all of yesterday installing xubuntu but its slower then win98 anyhow, so I want to go back to it.
2008-02-03T19:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	Then you need to ask in #windows.. it isnt a Ubuntu problem..
2008-02-03T19:27:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	Yes sir :P
2008-02-03T19:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	How much ram are you running in that box
2008-02-03T19:29:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	192mb
2008-02-03T19:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	How much of that is shared with your video card?
2008-02-03T19:31:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not sure, its a laptop that I haven't touched in awhile
2008-02-03T19:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	Either way, if you are going back to 98.. one of the better windows versions.. Itisnt an issue for here.  But reducing the shared video will help with the linux install
2008-02-03T19:33:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	How would reduce the shared video inside of xubuntu?
2008-02-03T19:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	You cant do it inside the os.. it is a bios thing..
2008-02-03T19:34:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	K Thanks for your help
2008-02-03T19:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	np
2008-02-03T19:38:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	I can't find where to change the shared memory in the Bios
2008-02-03T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	Not sure of your hardware.. but it is not always clear, but is always marked video something
2008-02-03T19:39:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	I'll take another look
2008-02-03T19:42:00.000Z	nathan__	Jack_Sparrow	I can't find it anywhere, do you know of any ways to make xubuntu faster? Or another distro thats lightweight and has wireless support?
2008-02-03T19:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	dsl.. damn small linux or something like that..  check distrowatch..
2008-07-20T01:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	 A minute of your time please
2008-12-26T23:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nathan__	You must follow each upgrade, dont skip//
