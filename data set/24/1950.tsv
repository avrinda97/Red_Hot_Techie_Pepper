2009-11-25T22:52:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	Well, I'm chatting from another computer since the system in question doesn't have internet.  Not sure how to go about this other than retyping the output.
2009-11-25T22:54:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	got an usb stick? just copy paste the output to a file and copy iut that way?
2009-11-25T22:55:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	does it show eth0 or eth1 ?
2009-11-25T22:56:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	Yeah, I'll copy it over on a flashdrive.  Hold on. (And thanks.)
2009-11-25T22:56:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	if you have a laptop try connecting it to the network connection to make sure its physically fine , im guessing you are using dhcp normally to get an ip?

2009-11-25T23:00:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	you have an ip there, did you manually set it, can you ping 192.168.1.1 ?
2009-11-25T23:01:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	No I didn't manually set it and the ping works fine.

2009-11-25T23:05:00.000Z	acicula		paste the output somewhere?
2009-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	It's small: domain commspeed.net / search commspeed.net / nameserver 169.254.1.1  (on different lines)
2009-11-25T23:06:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	We don't use commspeed anymore though.  Should I change it to my new ISP?
2009-11-25T23:07:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	yep
2009-11-25T23:07:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	you can set that through network settings though
2009-11-25T23:07:00.000Z	acicula		right click the network icon and choose edit connections etc
2009-11-25T23:09:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	Do you know where the field is to change in the network settings?  I'm not fnding it.
2009-11-25T23:10:00.000Z	acicula	parolang	under network connections, the wired connection
2009-11-25T23:11:00.000Z	parolang	acicula	It only has fields for MAC address and MTU.  No domain or search fields.
