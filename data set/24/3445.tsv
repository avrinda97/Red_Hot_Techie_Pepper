2008-08-13T16:24:00.000Z	tonisius		is the "hard disk" the fastest form to boot from?
2008-08-13T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	solid state
2008-08-13T16:25:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	solid state has quick read? and SATA support?
2008-08-13T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	yes, kicks the ass off platter based drives but cost a lot per Gb
2008-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	I only need less than a gig
2008-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	thanks
2008-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	then id get a solid state hdd or a card reader with a card
2008-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	i wouldnt worry about boot times, just in system performance
2008-08-13T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	sdc1 is a partition on sdc which is secondary master
2008-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	what does it say when you try?
2008-08-13T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	you mayhave to make the partition the ACTIVE partition
2008-08-13T17:25:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	how do I make the partition active, that's sort of new to me
2008-08-13T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	well yeah, the system will boot the active partition, if you install grub on an inactive partition it wont do anything
2008-08-13T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	that too
2008-08-13T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	id check its the active partition in fdisk or cfdisk
2008-08-13T17:30:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	wow, just looked up my linux partitions with cfdisk /dev/sdc
2008-08-13T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	id look at all your partitions on all drives to make sure you know whats going on
2008-08-13T17:34:00.000Z	tonisius	ActionParsnip	any suggestions now?
2008-08-13T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	you can change the partition type in fdisk but id backup the data on it in case of error
2008-08-13T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	id look at changing the type but im not sure abut the data
2008-08-13T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	id backup the data and remake the partition so its all consistant
2008-08-13T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	you can use what you want
2008-08-13T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonisius	what if the drive fails. how will you recover the data??
