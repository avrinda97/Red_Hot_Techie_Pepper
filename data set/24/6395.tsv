2005-11-01T10:08:00.000Z	ecobuntu		what's google?
2005-11-01T10:08:00.000Z	ecobuntu		sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	ecobuntu		or sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	ecobuntu		probably the later is easier
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	ecobuntu		latter
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	ecobuntu		vi is what i learned on
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	ecobuntu		not as intuitive as gedit
2005-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	vi is much better, when you have the time :-)
2005-11-01T10:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	and once you've had the time, you never go back :-)
2005-11-01T10:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	I'm currently liking xfce4
2005-11-01T10:13:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xenguy	you could always install gnome programs :)
2005-11-01T10:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	yah :)
2005-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	funny, I'm the exact opposite
2005-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	I find dogs stinky all over, where as cats clean themselves all the time <shrug>
2005-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xenguy	yeah i agree...but it's a different kind of stink
2005-11-21T10:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	yeah, just the dumb ones :p
2005-11-21T10:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	give me a break, nobody up here want to be an "American Idiot" (thanks Green Day :P )
2005-11-21T10:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	yes
2005-11-26T06:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	I would be interested to know how much lighter something like fluxbox really is than xfce4...
2005-11-26T06:05:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xenguy	i think it's way lighter
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	for example, I tried a bunch of different WM's last week, and they didn't load any faster than xfce4 from what I could see.  Now maybe the memory usage is less, that I don't know
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xenguy	well it's faster but if you're running KDE and GNOME apps it's still going to eat up your speed
2005-11-26T06:06:00.000Z	Xenguy	ecobuntu	makes sense
2005-11-26T06:07:00.000Z	ecobuntu	Xenguy	yeah...
