2007-07-31T15:38:00.000Z	rausb0	deh	if you use the dhcp function of your router, you have to configure a fixed ip adress for the mac adress of your ubuntu server. if the router lacks this function, just configure a static ip address on the ubuntu server
2007-07-31T15:39:00.000Z	rausb0	deh	you have to know whether you are using dhcp or not
2007-07-31T15:40:00.000Z	rausb0	deh	after all, it's _your_ router, so you have to know its config
2007-07-31T15:42:00.000Z	rausb0	deh	and pastebin the content of the file /etc/network/interfaces too
2007-07-31T15:45:00.000Z	rausb0	deh	yes, hw addr is the mac address
2007-07-31T15:46:00.000Z	deh	rausb0	crap

2007-07-31T15:46:00.000Z	deh	rausb0	what am i supposed to use for "DHCP Client" on my router?
2007-07-31T15:47:00.000Z	deh	rausb0	there's my old comp's name with the same mac address
2007-07-31T15:47:00.000Z	deh	rausb0	and then a button beside it that says clone
