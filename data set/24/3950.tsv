2007-08-24T10:55:00.000Z	mrfr01		Completely lost, Just got an Acer Aspire 5570, wireless does not work. My wireless card is an, Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG, I've tried the documentation... but I'm lost. Any help?
2007-08-24T10:56:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	What chipset? Or is that the chipset?
2007-08-24T10:57:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	Literally just bought the laptop, where would I find the chipset information?
2007-08-24T10:57:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Let me google it. IDK if lspci would work or not.
2007-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	I found something on Google.
2007-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Let me find something specific to Ubuntu.
2007-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	I hope that you are able to, I've been trying to make this work for 3 hrs =(
2007-08-24T11:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	What happens when you sudo modprobe ipw3945 ?
2007-08-24T11:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Ahh.
2007-08-24T11:03:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Do you have it turned on? (Function Key + Wi-fi button usually)
2007-08-24T11:03:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=187747 That is a thread I found which might give you some insights.
2007-08-24T11:04:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	What would the WiFi key look like?
2007-08-24T11:06:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	It's the button to turn on the wi-fi adapter. I'd have to look at a digital camera picture of the keyboard to tell you.
2007-08-24T11:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Did you find it?
2007-08-24T11:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Hello?
2007-08-24T11:26:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	Was able to turn on the wireless card, so when I run a sudo modprobe ipw3945 i no longer get the error message... any thoughts from here?
2007-08-24T11:28:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Glad you responded. Now try playing with the network manager.
2007-08-24T11:29:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	It's the icon that is by the clock.
2007-08-24T11:30:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	The only things that I see in there are for the 'Wired connection' and 'Manual Configuration' in the Manual configuration, it only has my wired card and a modem, nothing about my wireless card
2007-08-24T11:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Let me look some more.
2007-08-24T11:31:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	I really appreciate he help
2007-08-24T11:33:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	No clue at this point.
2007-08-24T11:34:00.000Z	mrfr01	MrObvious	Alrighty, well I really appreciate the help. Who would have known that you had to turn it on... lol, thanks anyhow.
2007-08-24T11:34:00.000Z	MrObvious	mrfr01	Maybe try a reboot. You're welcome
