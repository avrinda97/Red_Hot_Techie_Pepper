2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	sprwal		hi all, I just upgraded to hoary but no sound from totem...
2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	does sound work with anything else?
2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	sprwal		the rest of the sistem is playing well
2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	sprwal		yea
2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	sprwal	njan	the system sounds are ok.
2005-02-06T12:30:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	killall esd, close and reopen totem, and see if that makes a difference
2005-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	sprwal		let'sse
2005-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	it's probably because gnome 2.9 with hoary runs the enlightenment sound daemon by default and afaik totem won't output to esd. It'll be trying alsa, and since alsa is locked (by esd), it doesn't give you sound
2005-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	if you start it (or xmms, if you have xmms set to alsa output) from a terminal you'll see all of the alsa breakage messages.
2005-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	sprwal		xmms seems broken to me
2005-02-06T12:31:00.000Z	sprwal		a library problem I guess
2005-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	sprwal	njan	yea it's working now
2005-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	esd is your problem
2005-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	sprwal		it's the esd stuff
2005-02-06T12:32:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	you can either configure xmms to output via esd (in preferences) or tell gnome not to start esd
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	sprwal		mh so I got to make totem work with esd, or yea that
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	njan		the one disadvantage of removing esd is that you only have one sound source at a time.
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	njan		yeah.
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	sprwal		mh nono
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	sprwal		better work with esd
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	njan		THere's an option in gnome's sounds configuration screen for 'sound daemon' - I can't remember the exact wording of it.
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	sprwal		anyhow, hoary it's impressive
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	sprwal		I would just like to say THanks to the laptop team
2005-02-06T12:33:00.000Z	njan	sprwal	:).. I like it. Glad your sound now works ;)
