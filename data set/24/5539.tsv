2008-05-16T17:14:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	did you get an answer to your question?  I've been trying to find the same thing
2008-05-16T17:14:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	not yet mate.
2008-05-16T17:14:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	I'm trying to figure out how to have my secondary drive automount
2008-05-16T17:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	 hahah
2008-05-16T17:15:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	I know it's probably somewhere in /etc/fstab but I get scared messing with that.
2008-05-16T17:15:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	I know how to do it manually but really hate trying to teach n00bs like my father to edit a text file like fstab
2008-05-16T17:15:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	and I've used Linux since 96' exclusively.
2008-05-16T17:15:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	hahaha...ok....not just n00bs then!
2008-05-16T17:16:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	nope :)
2008-05-16T17:16:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	 If you want I can help...fstab isn't so scary... :)
2008-05-16T17:16:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	 but I would much rather know how to point and click to get the same job done.. ;)
2008-05-16T17:16:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	ahhh  You are looking for a tool for your Dad
2008-05-16T17:17:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	 yep...I got no problems with fstab....
2008-05-16T17:17:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	hmm actually that's a good thing to google I think.  gui fstab
2008-05-16T17:19:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	apt-cache search fstab
2008-05-16T17:20:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	pysdm!

2008-05-16T17:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	Trae	 plus it isn't part of the core...There has to be something the Ubuntu devs thought was worthy... ;)
2008-05-16T17:22:00.000Z	Trae	v0lksman	you'd think.  :/
