2007-05-11T12:25:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		Will the normal Ubuntu installation let me be able to do dual boot? Windows + Ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		So
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		You mean that if I go through the normal installation
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		It won't delete Windows?
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	Mirage	EhPrettyEasy	yes, if windows is installed first, then ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		Yeah i have windows now
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	Mirage		it should work without any more configuration
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		And ubuntu cd with me
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	Mirage		i just did that today
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		I know the men
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		But someone told me that I should partition.
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		Use some program of defrag.
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	Mirage		Oh, yes. you need some unallocated space for ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		But, how do I do it? I have no idea.
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		I have Paragon Partition Manager, but I don't know how to use it.
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	Mirage		Do you have more than one partition on your PC?
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		uhmhm, I dont think so
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		You mean C: and others?
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	Mirage		So there's only C: and nothing else?
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		There is C: and D:
2007-05-11T12:29:00.000Z	Mirage		If D: is a hard drive partition, you might want to back it up somewhere, and then delete the partition and remake the ones you need for ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:29:00.000Z	Mirage		I moved all od my D: to a friend's PC over the network and wiped the entire partition
2007-05-11T12:29:00.000Z	Mirage		then remade a few partitios for ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:29:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy	Mirage	could you take a look at this picture and tell me what I need to change? http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=Eh+Pretty+Easy&word2=Bob+Lablah
