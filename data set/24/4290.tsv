2007-05-15T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	tips for what
2007-05-15T07:23:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	does lspci even show it
2007-05-15T07:24:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	want to see the outputs?
2007-05-15T07:24:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	stick them in a pastebin
2007-05-15T07:29:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	I can't see a prism card in that list
2007-05-15T07:30:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	from the pastebin
2007-05-15T07:31:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	line 528
2007-05-15T07:31:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	I see it
2007-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	any ideas?
2007-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	sorry - just talking to someone
2007-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	not a problem
2007-05-15T07:43:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	are you still there
2007-05-15T09:37:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	can you shed any further light on my wifi problem?
2007-05-15T09:37:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	not really, I find it strange that you can see it in some tools but not in others. It looks like some very low level issue
2007-05-15T09:39:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	- got any suggestions on where i should look? is it boot options maybe?
2007-05-15T09:39:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	I can't see it being a boot option thing to be honest, there must be something very specific to that card model. Is that card/chipset listed in the supported hardware compatability list
2007-05-15T09:40:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	i cant find the specific card model anywhere but the chipset is prism2.5 and like i say the driver that backtrack2 uses is prism2_cs but i cant ge tthat to load in ubuntu
2007-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	I've no idea what backtrack2 is
2007-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	sorry its another debian distro i downloaded a while ago
2007-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	ikonia	simianbandit	perhaps mail them and ask them for specifics if they have figured it out
2007-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	simianbandit	ikonia	thanks, will try that (wont they tell me to naff off cos i'm trying it on another distro?)
