2007-09-12T11:20:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		cox. BSD is a family of unix like OS
2007-09-12T11:20:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		similar to linux
2007-09-12T11:20:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		leading BSD OS's are freebsd, netbsd and openbsd
2007-09-12T11:21:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		not much..
2007-09-12T11:21:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		bigbang.. do a dmesg|tail and check if there ar any errors
2007-09-12T11:21:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		thrown by CD drive
2007-09-12T11:23:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		cox, i aint sure smooth wall deals with .deb installs
2007-09-12T11:24:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		cox, nothing is impossible, it is all a matter of coding :p , it aint trivial
2007-09-12T11:24:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		did you check if it supports yum or any other repos based install...
2007-09-12T11:25:00.000Z	fermatstheorem		Nemsis, check you netowrk connectivity
2007-09-12T11:25:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	what specifically about it? i know i can definitely connect and do some things with ssh, run apps and soforth, i just can't do it for long
2007-09-12T11:29:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	ok can i do that from ssh? i'm not familiar with how to enable telnet or use it
2007-09-12T11:31:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	i'm in a different state than this server so any sort of port forwarding that has to be done I need to put in a request over the phone, what port do i need to open and what do i do after its open
2007-09-12T11:32:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	apache2 and mysql i believe
2007-09-12T11:32:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	i am not sure if that port is set to forward though, its intended to be run locally
2007-09-12T11:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	from my remote machine or from the ssh server locally?
2007-09-12T11:35:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	apparently not
2007-09-12T11:36:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	its just a couple of php applications we are testing out, its not meant to be connected to from outside machines
2007-09-12T11:38:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	unfortunately this is the only ubuntu machine on the facility I believe and the only one set up to use ssh
2007-09-12T11:39:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	i could check, theyre usually pretty busy, but would they just set the router to forward port 80, or maybe on the LAN try to ssh to the machine's IP?
2007-09-12T11:42:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	so what would be to blame then if that is the case? i mean im even able to connect and use the functionality of ssh, just that it disconnects me after about 3 mins
2007-09-12T11:42:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	ssh's port is definitely set to forward in the router
2007-09-12T11:44:00.000Z	NemesisD	fermatstheorem	so what would be the solution if that were the case
2007-09-12T11:45:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	NemesisD	your network dude has to find out where the packets are getting dropped, starting from teh server end till ur end
