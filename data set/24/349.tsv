2012-01-18T22:42:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	HE creates the reverse tunnel, YOU connect through it

2012-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	and it still doesnt
2012-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	then you/he made it wrong, reverse tunneling works
2012-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	thats possible :)
2012-01-18T22:45:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	HE creates the reverse tunnel to YOUR machine which needs sshd running and being accessible from WAN, then YOU connect through it
2012-01-18T22:46:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	ok
2012-01-18T23:12:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	hi ! uhm.. i dont quite get it yet.. so on the destination amchine i have to issue " ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 user@sourcehost"?
2012-01-18T23:13:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	user@yourhost
2012-01-18T23:15:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	HE (the one you want but cannot connect to) issues:       ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 validuser@your.wan.ip.nr
2012-01-18T23:15:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	then YOU type: ssh -p 19999 localhost
2012-01-18T23:17:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	thx we try!
2012-01-18T23:18:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	THX it works :D

2012-01-18T23:32:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	got to bother u one more time :].. uhm i im now connected via ssh to his machine.. now i would like to issue a program such as cheese but open the window on my local machine, how can i do that?
2012-01-18T23:33:00.000Z	llutz	Nfisher	needs ssh -X   (X-forwarding)
2012-01-18T23:33:00.000Z	Nfisher	llutz	oh ok
