2010-09-04T05:47:00.000Z	raj__		mom do you have your nvidia driver installed ?
2010-09-04T05:47:00.000Z	raj__		mom  the best way to do it is going to > hardware drivers > and installing nvidia current
2010-09-04T05:48:00.000Z	raj__		mom if you install the current .. the old one will be removed
2010-09-04T05:48:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	you can have more than one nvidia driver version installed at the same time
2010-09-04T05:49:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 nit really .. if you do it throught the hardware drivers .. it takes off the old one
2010-09-04T05:49:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	you just swap the using update-alternatives or sth ;)
2010-09-04T05:50:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	one is active but is the old one purged from the system?
2010-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 yup .. i even checked to see if its nstalled in apt-get it was gone
2010-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	seems my gf has something messed up .. she has 2 versions :)
2010-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 i think in 10.04 they did that as a noob proof way not to get drivers more than once
2010-09-04T05:52:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 lol
2010-09-04T05:53:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	women ;)
2010-09-04T05:55:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 you should have recondigured xserver for her b4 reboot
2010-09-04T05:55:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	i believe the xorg.conf was changed earlier ...
2010-09-04T05:55:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	well see :)
2010-09-04T05:56:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	what's the aticonfig --initial for nvidia?
2010-09-04T06:01:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	anything except changing Drivers line needed?
2010-09-04T06:02:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	the module is right but it cannot be loaded :/
2010-09-04T06:02:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg    try this and reboot
2010-09-04T06:03:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	why should i? :D
2010-09-04T06:03:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 i mean for mom .. this will update her xserver with the new drivers (current) she just installed
2010-09-04T06:04:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	hmm .. thought its done by package manager ...
2010-09-04T06:05:00.000Z	bodwick	raj__	purge nvidia-* should have cleaned any garbage, right?
2010-09-04T06:06:00.000Z	raj__	bodwick	 not always ... there are alot of nvidia junk in there that might be installed ..
