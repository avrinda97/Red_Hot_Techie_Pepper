2009-04-17T23:00:00.000Z	dooglus		which application is responsible for automounting my phone's memory card when I plug it in to a USB port please?
2009-04-17T23:02:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	probably the same one responsible automounting other kind of cards and other storage devices
2009-04-17T23:03:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	are you plugging it in and finding it doesn't automount and trying to figure out why?
2009-04-17T23:04:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	yes.  until today it was automounting.  now it isn't.  I'm wondering how I broke it.
2009-04-17T23:05:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	does it show up in "dmesg" command output?
2009-04-17T23:05:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	these are the things I disabled earlier today, thinking them unneccesary for me: bluetooth manager, evolution alarm notifier, gnome login sound, network manager, print queue applet, pulseaudio session manager, remote desktop, user folders update, and visual assistance
2009-04-17T23:05:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	also, does it add a device to the contents of /proc/partitions ?
2009-04-17T23:05:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	try re-enabling user folders update
2009-04-17T23:06:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	it shows up as '[25301.220307] usb 1-6.3: new full speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 37'
2009-04-17T23:06:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	OK, so the driver sees it ... the kernel does not automount it ... some user program gets notified of new device and does so ... that may be connected to the folders update
2009-04-17T23:06:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	it doesn't add anything to /proc/partitions
2009-04-17T23:07:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	try re-enabling user folders update
2009-04-17T23:07:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	and reboot to be sure things got started that might not be
2009-04-17T23:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	I have done.  I've not rebooted or logged out and in again since, but I also didn't do either since disabling it...
2009-04-17T23:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	I think 'user folders update' is responsible for recreating a bunch of empty folders every time I log in: ~/Porn, ~/TV and such like - that I then have to delete
2009-04-17T23:09:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	something adds a new folder for a drive when I plug in a drive ... was just a guess
2009-04-17T23:09:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	I also took the liberty of uninstalling pulseaudio or some such.  it was taking a lot of RAM, and making audio and video be out of sync
2009-04-17T23:10:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	I have no idea with all these apps and things ... I'm more of a kernel, driver, bootloader, firmware, embedded stuff programmer
2009-04-17T23:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	but I would have thought that would be related to this problem - just trying to think what I've changed today
2009-04-17T23:10:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	I doubt pulseaudio is responsible
2009-04-17T23:12:00.000Z	Skapare	dooglus	the sync problems are inherit in bad format designs for most of the audio-video formats ... players have to do weird things to keep them in sync ... some do better than others
2009-04-17T23:13:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	ok, fine :)
2009-04-17T23:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	it seems that disabling startup apps and removing pulseaudio had no effect.
2009-04-17T23:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Skapare	I switched to a different USB port and now automount is working again
