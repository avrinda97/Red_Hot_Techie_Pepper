2009-06-12T21:01:00.000Z	rameshwo		any links for visual tutorials on linux ??
2009-06-12T21:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 theres some sites with such things.. but  it all depends on wha tyou want to learn  'linux' is a large topic.
2009-06-12T21:03:00.000Z	rameshwo	Dr_Willis	 command lines. administrative tasks...... but i am looking for audio\video tutorials...
2009-06-12T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 for command line... go find a few books on bash.  watching a video of someone using bash.. just dosent really teach you much.
2009-06-12T21:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 same for admin tasks.   Now leraning gnomebasics..there were some video tutorials of that.. but most of it are things you can easially figure out for yourself.
2009-06-12T21:04:00.000Z	rameshwo	Dr_Willis	: yes reading is good but visuals strikes directly in mind.. so..
2009-06-12T21:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	watching a video of someone doing 'command line stuff' is not going to teach you much. reading  is much better. But i guess you can hit google and search for video ubuntu training, or check out theubuntu 'training books here' --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Training
2009-06-12T21:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 learning linux is very much a 'self motivated' sort of thing. :)
2009-06-12T21:07:00.000Z	rameshwo	Dr_Willis	yes i have great interest..  and really want to explore it widely...
2009-06-12T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 different desktop enviroments for the main part.
2009-06-12T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 the core is the same.
2009-06-12T21:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 Huh? xubuntu has the xfce desktop... kudubnut has the kde desktop.. ubuntu uses 'gnome' - thats about it.
2009-06-12T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 you can easially install all 3 desktops on a machine.. and pick what one to use at login time.
2009-06-12T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 use ubuntu packages for ubuntu.. debian packages for debian. dont mix them up
2009-06-12T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 for the most part.. yes.
2009-06-12T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 depends on your needs...
2009-06-12T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 they are all rather easy to learn.
2009-06-12T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 and you can easially install all 3 and try them all out on any ubuntu disrto
2009-06-12T22:04:00.000Z	rameshwo	Dr_Willis	i have slow internet speed..  so problem download..
2009-06-12T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 if your system specs are rather low. Youmay want to try xubuntu othewise - stick with ubuntu
2009-06-12T22:07:00.000Z	rameshwo	Dr_Willis	any advantages  of ubuntu over xubuntu        yesi have low systm spec.. 256 Ram , 735 Mz procesor . please don't suggest me mini distors . it doesn't feel like running linux....
2009-06-12T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 low system specs = Use xubuntu then.
2009-06-12T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 and i use many mini-disrtos. :)  How can you say they dotn feel like running linux? you have much linux experience?
2009-06-12T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rameshwo	 and your sysem specs are very low for xubuntu. it should run. but more ram would be a big big help.
