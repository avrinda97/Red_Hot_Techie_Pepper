2010-08-21T05:14:00.000Z	terov		hey folks, having wireless trouble (massive packet loss on all networks; network cuts out intermittently; drastically long pings/latency at random intervals). happens on all networks, but wasn't happening until i installed my new router. any ideas?
2010-08-21T05:14:00.000Z	terov		wired network works without a hitch.
2010-08-21T05:14:00.000Z	terov		MichaelH: my router?

2010-08-21T05:15:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	right, the new router seemed to set it off, but now my laptop has trouble with all wireless networks.
2010-08-21T05:16:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	regardless of restarts, using google DNS, etc. i thought it might be a dns problem, but it also does it with straight IP addresses now.
2010-08-21T05:16:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	(it being, huge latency after operating for anywhere between 1-10 minutes, and eventually all hosts become unreachable)
2010-08-21T05:17:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	have tried flushing my routing tables, etc.
2010-08-21T05:17:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 thats weird
2010-08-21T05:18:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	extremely. i'm honestly beginning to wonder if the wireless hardware sustained some kind of physical bump.
2010-08-21T05:19:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 sounds like it what card?
2010-08-21T05:19:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	i forget--let me check.
2010-08-21T05:19:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 ok
2010-08-21T05:21:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	csis: incidentally, DNS lookups are almost always dreadfully slow--wired OR wireless. been using google's DNS without improvement.
2010-08-21T05:23:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	device is intel  PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN
2010-08-21T05:23:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 no probs before?
2010-08-21T05:25:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	before the new router? nope.
2010-08-21T05:25:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	worked without a hitch on other wireless networks as well.
2010-08-21T05:25:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	new router is the linksys e1000, which i'm going to replace. it is an awful machine.
2010-08-21T05:26:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	indeed, but why would other wireless networks not work?
2010-08-21T05:26:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 not sure
2010-08-21T05:27:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	will tinker around with it further and see if i can't get it ironed out.
2010-08-21T05:27:00.000Z	terov	hiexpo	appreciate the thoughts.
2010-08-21T05:27:00.000Z	hiexpo	terov	 no prob good luck buddy
