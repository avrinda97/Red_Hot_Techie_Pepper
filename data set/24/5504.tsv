2006-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	alephant		I installed the linux-server kernel package, and I want to remove all the "other" kernel packages in one fell swoop.
2006-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	alephant		apt-get remove linux-image-386 only removes the virtual package; I want the specific 2.6.15-xx-arch and modules packages as well
2006-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	alephant		what's the packagename to remove?
2006-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	you will need to list them and delete manually
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	you're kidding me!
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	the versions can be listed on your menu.lst
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	is there really no way to get 'em all automagically?
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	no, they are working on a way to do that on the next version
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	I do that frequently, it is not that hard :)
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	I can do it manually, but I'm trying to script so that all newly-installed boxen are identical
2006-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	well, you woul need to script that
2006-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	it is an easy script :P
2006-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	Feh.  I'm not afraid of scripting ig... I was just hoping that apt-get would do the heavy lifting for me
2006-08-21T14:20:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	not on this case, that is beeing worked for edgy, someone will do that script for you :P
2006-08-21T14:20:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	btw, make sure you roll out your machines with the .1 CD :)
2006-08-21T14:21:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	btw, you are doing a mass rollout ?
2006-08-21T14:22:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	Not really.  Just got a bunch of customers who are paying for install/support and I'd like to be able to not think about them individually.
2006-08-21T14:22:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	ah ok :)
2006-08-21T14:22:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	I'm working on a Xen approach, and I'm definitely looking at debootstrap
2006-08-21T14:23:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	do you know openvz ? maybe its also a good option :)
2006-08-21T14:24:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	never heard of it.  STFWing it...
2006-08-21T14:24:00.000Z	lamego	alephant	its a lighter virtualization, os level virtualization
2006-08-21T14:26:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	OpenVZ's logo makes my eyes hurt :-b
2006-08-21T14:30:00.000Z	alephant	lamego	OpenVZ looks interesting.  Have you ever used it?
