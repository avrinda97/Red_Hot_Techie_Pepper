2008-08-12T05:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_		how can I create a partition that is hidden under windows, and encripted under ubuntu? is it possible to do that?
2008-08-12T05:10:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	any partition u create in ubuntu except fat32 will be invisible in default windows installation and regarding encription look here http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/08/17/7-steps-to-an-encrypted-partition-local-or-removable-disk/
2008-08-12T05:11:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	thanks, but I've heard that using a driver is possible to detect linux partitions. I need to turn a partition into "invisible"
2008-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	that is not possible windows is an os after all and has access to hardware, it may not know what type the partition is but it sure will see that its a partition of sorts
2008-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	so there is no way to make a hidden partition after all? The only way would be messing up with the hardware firmware, right?
2008-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	that is correct, something like manually mapping half the disk as bad blocks
2008-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	thats just a guess
2008-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	all right, thanks
2008-08-12T05:28:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	a pretty good idea is to keep /home on its own partition and also /etc
2008-08-12T05:29:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	so most of the configuration features are saved under /home, /etc and /boot?
2008-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	about the size of your total RAM if u want to hibernate
2008-08-12T05:33:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	yea i think i rushed a bit with /etc being on a separate partition, dont do it
2008-08-12T05:34:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	so how many partitions you would suggest me to have my PC to run with Windows and Ubuntu? - swap, /home, /, and C:?
2008-08-12T05:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	sorry to bother you again, but which size would you suggest for "/boot" and "/"?
2008-08-12T05:44:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	just buy an external hdd big enough to fit your entire partition back up your whole hdd once in a while, u can even make it scheduled backups
2008-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	IndyGunFreak, thanks guys
2008-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	also look into aptoncd it makes a backup of all your installed programs so u wouldnt have to download them all again from the internet
2008-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	excellent, I did not know that. I used to waste hours downloading everything. Where is aptoncd?
2008-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	its in one of the repositories sudo apt-get install aptoncd
2008-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	ubuntu_	usser	ohh I see
2008-08-12T05:59:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	oh yea sure partimage is one option, if u dont want to go into complications use dd, it has its drawbacks since dd also save unused part of your partition
2009-05-11T03:40:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	this is jen is the internet.
2009-05-11T03:41:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	an ip for root?
2009-05-11T03:41:00.000Z	usser	ubuntu_	what does that mean?
