2011-04-22T21:01:00.000Z	etyrnal		anyone here know how to set up PuTTY so that i can use PuTTY to ssh to my home machine, then from the home machine, ssh to another home machine ( ssh -Y machine ?), then use tightvnc to vnc to the remote machine by telling tighvnc to connect to 127.0.0.1:5900 on the local machine?
2011-04-22T21:01:00.000Z	etyrnal		anyone?  bueler?  fry?
2011-04-22T21:02:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	Check out the "-L" switch I think it is.
2011-04-22T21:02:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	You might want to look into "port forwarding"
2011-04-22T21:02:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	i have PuTTY set to forward 5900 dynamically
2011-04-22T21:03:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	putty should do it in one go...
2011-04-22T21:03:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	its just you <-> home machine <-> vnc server right?
2011-04-22T21:04:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	 local machine <-> remote machine 1 <-> remote machine 2
2011-04-22T21:04:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	and the vnc server is running on remote machine 2?
2011-04-22T21:04:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	or is it on another machine, only viewable by rem mac 2?
2011-04-22T21:05:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	well BOTH remote machines have vnc server running...  but i was thinking that the tunnel would be through the middle machine all the way to the remote -- no?
2011-04-22T21:05:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	what vnc server do you want to connect to? the one running on remote machine 2?
2011-04-22T21:05:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	the farthest remote machine has a working vnc server running
2011-04-22T21:05:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	ok
2011-04-22T21:05:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	right
2011-04-22T21:06:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	this is easy then, in putty ssh to remote machine 1, in the ssh > tunnel menu, add remote machine 2's ip, and put 5900 in both local and destination ports.
2011-04-22T21:06:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	Then connect, and finally vnc to localhost:5900
2011-04-22T21:07:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	in theory, i should be able to forward a any attempt to connect to this local machine's :5900 to the middle machine (if tunnel stop there), or if tunnel goes to last machine (and port forwarding i set up properly) i should be able to vnc to that remote machine 2 right?
2011-04-22T21:07:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	ok - so i am getting closer
2011-04-22T21:07:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	i.e. http://static.unto.net/putty_tunnel_added.jpg - there have "5900" in the "source port" and <remote machine 2's ip>:5900 in the "destination"
2011-04-22T21:08:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	no if you set that up as i've explained, you will vnc to localhost:5900 and it'll send you directly to <remote machine 2's ip>:5900
2011-04-22T21:08:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	by magic :-)
2011-04-22T21:09:00.000Z	Pricey	etyrnal	http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/sshtips.htm has an explanation halfway down (search for "putty for windowsxp")
2011-04-22T21:36:00.000Z	etyrnal	Pricey	thanks for Your help
