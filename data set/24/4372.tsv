2007-08-20T10:24:00.000Z	neverblue	edulix	I was asking about the ubuntu media you possess
2007-08-20T10:25:00.000Z	neverblue	edulix	anyways, to get to the point, did the install go successful?

2007-08-20T10:26:00.000Z	edulix	neverblue	I tell you, everything worked fine two weeks ago, but probably after an update of maybe fglrx or acpi-support or something.. THEN SUSPEND TO RAM STOPPED WORKING
