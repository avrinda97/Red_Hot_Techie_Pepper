2011-05-14T00:32:00.000Z	mattypants`		if i cant see in my root folder does that mean Im not an admin?
2011-05-14T00:32:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	yes it does
2011-05-14T00:32:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	well, you may have sudo rights
2011-05-14T00:32:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	what are you trying to do?
2011-05-14T00:33:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	that is because you don't have root privileges. You need to run the file manager with gksudo.
2011-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	mattypants`	smw	should I have root priviledges?
2011-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	if you want to edit stuff... yes. If you don't want to break things, no
2011-05-14T00:39:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	you want to run the file manager, nautilus, using gksudo
2011-05-14T00:40:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	please note that the system assumes you know what you are doing and does not question completely stupid things done with admin privileges ;-)
2011-05-14T00:40:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	for example, someone wanted to free up some space and deleted /tmp...
2011-05-14T00:41:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	he thought he "didn't need it"
2011-05-14T00:42:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	exactly
2011-05-14T00:42:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	or one person changed all the permissions on /etc to 777
2011-05-14T00:42:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	that destroyed a system. You hear the funniest things in this channel :-)
2011-05-14T00:44:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	my general rule. If you need to use sudo for nautilus, you should be using the cli :-P
2011-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	mattypants`	smw	Im really new, I barely understand why you mean by that
2011-05-14T00:47:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	nm then :-P
2011-05-14T00:51:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	groups
2011-05-14T00:51:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	linux people are not creative with naming :-P
2011-05-14T00:53:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	one exception to being uncreative, the command "less"
2011-05-14T00:56:00.000Z	mattypants`	smw	how can I get my reg terminal back, since I started nautilus it's not a reg terminal
2011-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	um... I am afraid to try to explain it... so open a new one :-P
2011-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	mattypants`	smw	lol, k
2011-05-14T21:30:00.000Z	smw	mattypants`	unity is the great divider. I haven't upgraded yet ;-)
