2008-08-17T10:17:00.000Z	oakgrove		hi, i did something really stupid.  i mounted my /dev in a chroot and then did a rm -rf in the chroot.  i haven't rebooted yet.  is this install doomed?
2008-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	oakgrove		is there anyway to rebuild the /dev directory?
2008-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	reboot?
2008-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	jscinoz		or...
2008-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	jscinoz		MAKEDEV?
2008-08-17T10:18:00.000Z	oakgrove		if I reboot, my computer won't come back up.  i deleted almost my entire dev directory
2008-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	generally /dev is regenerated each boot i believe,
2008-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	if you want you could try opening a terminal, cd to /dev, then do sudo MAKEDEV generic
2008-08-17T10:19:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	that might do it.
2008-08-17T10:20:00.000Z	oakgrove		it's telling me makedev command not found and when i tried to install it, it said it was already installed
2008-08-17T10:22:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	the command is in upercase MAKEDEV
2008-08-17T10:22:00.000Z	jscinoz		upper*
2008-08-17T10:22:00.000Z	jscinoz		guys don't feed the trolls.
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	oakgrove		oh, thanks, i just tried that and it says udev active, devices will be created in /dev/.static/dev/
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	oakgrove		maybe it's working.
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	i really think you can just reboot
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	and /dev will be made automatically
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	its not a real directory on your filesystem
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	its like /proc i think
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	oakgrove		i'll give it a shot.  thanks jscinoz
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	oakgrove		i was hoping that was the case
2008-08-17T10:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	oakgrove	:)
2008-08-17T10:27:00.000Z	oakgrove		here goes nothing
2008-08-17T10:32:00.000Z	oakgrove	jscinoz	awesome, thanks.  rebooted with no problems and /dev is repopulated.  learn something new every day
