2012-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	used to work long time ago, now I am in 12.10 and is not recognized by network manager
2012-05-17T00:05:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	12.10? then #ubuntu+1
2012-05-17T00:06:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	what happens?
2012-05-17T00:07:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	the modem is not listed/recognized by network manager to connect
2012-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	is it shown by lsusb?
2012-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	yes

2012-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	one simple solution I used:  after plugging it in it was recognized as a CD, so I typed     eject sr1, waited a little and could connect
2012-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	if I remember correctly thats the same I did use
2012-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	will try, however is not listed as a cd
2012-05-17T00:12:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	you can open another terminal, type there   tailf /var/log/syslog     and watch what happens
2012-05-17T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	I've seen that, thats why I said it is the same as mine :-)

2012-05-17T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	I remember that part  too, but eventually it did "take" - I have not tried it in 12.04 though
2012-05-17T00:20:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	it used to work long time ago, however I have updated and now...
2012-05-17T00:21:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	sorry, then - I will have to try soon
2012-05-17T00:28:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	I have a slightly different one: Bus 002 Device 005: ID 19d2:0015 ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM, and it still seems to work
2012-05-17T00:37:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	now this worked, but is a shame is not more transparent https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/modemmanager/+bug/891307 smiki comment
2012-05-17T00:38:00.000Z	guntbert	ddn	I agree that it is tiresome - but an glad that you got it sorted :)
2012-05-17T00:41:00.000Z	ddn	guntbert	me too, really, good bye
