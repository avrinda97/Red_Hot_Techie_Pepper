2010-03-16T11:47:00.000Z	faerun		some apps showing status there (like skype etcpp)
2010-03-16T11:53:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	To add anything to a GNOME panel, right-click on the panel approximately where you want the new thing to go; choose 'Add to panel'.
2010-03-16T11:54:00.000Z	faerun	xiong	this i tried but I cant find the progs I miss or the service
2010-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	faerun	xiong	maybe I can reset my customize and go back to the installed standard?
2010-03-16T11:56:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	What *exactly* are you missing?
2010-03-16T11:58:00.000Z	xiong		Please, faerun, don't ask in /query window. Not only is it considered impolite in general on IRC; but others miss the benefit of our convo. Okay?
2010-03-16T11:58:00.000Z	faerun		ok sorry
2010-03-16T11:59:00.000Z	faerun		I miss some standard things like audio control panel
2010-03-16T11:59:00.000Z	faerun		and some status reports of running apps
2010-03-16T12:01:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	Not sure what you mean by 'audio control panel'. All I have is a volume control; that's part of 'Notification Area', I think.
2010-03-16T12:01:00.000Z	faerun	xiong	yeah thats it
2010-03-16T12:02:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	So, add that where you want it.
2010-03-16T12:02:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	Notification Area has a lot of useful stuff in it; they're not really related, though.
2010-03-16T12:04:00.000Z	faerun	xiong	did U know where I can modify this panel?
2010-03-16T12:05:00.000Z	xiong	faerun	It's completely up to you. Right-click on any panel, anywhere that there's space free.
