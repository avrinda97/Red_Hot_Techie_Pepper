2011-12-17T13:31:00.000Z	wp		anyone? :)
2011-12-17T13:32:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	 sudo service networking restart
2011-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	restart: Unknown instance:
2011-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	this is why i'm confused, i hate the new system ;P
2011-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	try service networking start
2011-12-17T13:37:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	networking stop/waiting
2011-12-17T13:43:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	11.10
2011-12-17T13:45:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	http://pastebin.com/UiPeHq3m
2011-12-17T13:45:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	guess you didnt see my other method
2011-12-17T13:47:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	http://pastebin.com/vNff0Va5
2011-12-17T13:47:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	this is why its a bit confusing for me :)
2011-12-17T13:48:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	that shows it worked
2011-12-17T13:48:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	hmm ok? :), i added some ipv6 config (static) and its not parsing it
2011-12-17T13:48:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	with network-manager, things might act differntly. I dont use it myself
2011-12-17T13:50:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	if you open the files in /etc/init.d, you can see what commands they support. not all support 'restart'
2011-12-17T13:52:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	you would think so
2011-12-17T13:52:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	thats why its probably not applying a single thing :)
2011-12-17T13:53:00.000Z	compdoc	wp	whats in /etc/network/interfaces   ?  and have you added and removed nics recently?
2011-12-17T13:54:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	i'll pastebin it, one sec
2011-12-17T13:54:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	http://pastebin.com/HupLtwZ7
2011-12-17T13:58:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	yep 100% sure
2011-12-17T14:08:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	networking status output, still shows stopped/waiting :)
2011-12-17T14:10:00.000Z	wp	compdoc	odd eh? :)
