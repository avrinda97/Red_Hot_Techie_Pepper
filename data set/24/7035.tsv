2005-05-20T15:55:00.000Z	holycow		windows users are equally stuck up about their platform
2005-05-20T15:56:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	heh i am very stuck up for linux
2005-05-20T15:56:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	i'm a zealot too, but i don't preach
2005-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	w3m? say what?
2005-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	the cli broswer
2005-05-21T15:55:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	scared me for a sec
2005-05-23T07:32:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	appearently hp is shipping ubuntu on laptops sold outside the u.s.
2005-05-23T07:32:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	AWESOME
2005-05-23T07:32:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	heh
2005-05-23T07:46:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	no linux or anything else will never storm any desktop, users simply don't have the skills to learn new gui's unless forced to, say in a workplace mandated type of environment
2005-05-23T07:47:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	ok i see but *they* will storm to alternatives come longhorn
2005-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	never?
2005-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	i don't think so there either, users tend to like the 'jail they are used to'
2005-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	ok we will se in 200 eerrr when ever longhorn ships
2005-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	oh indeed, ms bought that virtualization stuff so they can support all the the legacy stuff, but i think they are going to get their security right this time
2005-05-23T07:50:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	nah they are cutting features like  milliunum edition
2005-05-23T07:51:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	well, yeah :) you do have a point, but implementing a 'restricted user' config is trivial, which is what they are doing as i understand
2005-05-23T07:51:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	didnt they delete longhorn as shown and started over?
2005-05-23T07:52:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	what? as far as i know this is a rewrite from the ground up ... not sure
2005-05-23T07:53:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	i heard the just said forget it [rather soon before tiger]  and started completely over
2005-08-03T16:13:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	holycow	fixing other ppls over then fone sux
2005-08-03T16:13:00.000Z	holycow	hybrid_goth	i don't mind that, i litterally just hate having to sit down and try to fix that useless pos.
