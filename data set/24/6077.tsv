2007-03-03T11:33:00.000Z	sureshot		hey all i am using fc6 but the command is the same i would think could i have help mounting a unix cd
2007-03-03T11:34:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	mount -t 9660 /dev/cdrom /mount/point
2007-03-03T11:35:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	i dont think it is a 9660 it says on it to mount -t cdfs-o noversion /dev/rx*c /dev/cdrom i dont understand this
2007-03-03T11:36:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	have you seen the manpage for mount?
2007-03-03T11:36:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	yes call me dumb but man pages seem to alud me in meaning
2007-03-03T11:37:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	the basic syntax for mount is: mount -t fstype /dev/ice /mount/point
2007-03-03T11:38:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	does ubuntu handle cdfs as it says and is that /dev/ice or /dev/device
2007-03-03T11:38:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	/dev/ice is for you to understand, but masically you mount a device to a mount point
2007-03-03T11:38:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	not really sure, shouldn't the cd automount anyway?
2007-03-03T11:40:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	are you running within a VM?
2007-03-03T11:41:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	are you using vmware?
2007-03-03T11:42:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	yes open vms
2007-03-03T11:42:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	your cdrom should be linked to the virtual cdrom ...
2007-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	booting the emulator now and vms so thanks alot
2007-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	so you have an os (ubuntu?) in vms, correct? if so, then ubuntu should see a regular cd drive as vms is supposed to 'fool' it into doing so
2007-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	dont understand i am running simh in fc6 it runs the vms
2007-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	what do you have inside of openvms?
2007-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	nothing i am running linux first then running vms inside it
2007-03-03T11:48:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	I see ...
2007-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	how would i do it your way
2007-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	openvms runs just inside linux?
2007-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	a good place to ask would be the openvms people ...
2007-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	sureshot	slavik	i would have to go to the forums the channels are dead no one there so thanks for your help
2007-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	slavik	sureshot	np :-\
