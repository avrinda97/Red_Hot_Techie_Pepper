2010-12-18T09:53:00.000Z	chaospsychex		if I delete my main ntfs file partition using gpart will it prevent me from booting into ubuntu, which is installed on a separate partition
2010-12-18T09:54:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	it depends on if you ntfs partition is sda1 or not.
2010-12-18T09:57:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	     do you know how to use ....      dd          ?
2010-12-18T10:05:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	you could store it on sdb2, and then you can access it with a live cd, but you have to know how to mount the hard drive from the live cd. That's not to hard.
2010-12-18T10:06:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	do you have a live cd?
2010-12-18T10:09:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	I think that you will lose the exact address on the hard drive that sdb2 starts on. I forget what that is called. Can someone provide the name of that address that marks the beginning of the partition?
2010-12-18T10:13:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	yeah that's it. It may work, but I am not familiar with that utility.
2010-12-18T10:20:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	you aren't asking about resizing the partition, you just want to reformat and use the partition for data.. right?
2010-12-18T10:21:00.000Z	chaospsychex	incognito	yes
2010-12-18T10:21:00.000Z	chaospsychex	incognito	will it work?
2010-12-18T10:23:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	I don't know. without doing some research, which I don't have time for right now, I can only tell you how I know how to do it.
2010-12-18T10:23:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	do you have a flash drive?
2010-12-18T10:25:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	download a live cd, and learn how to use dd...         it's simple.
2010-12-18T10:35:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	if you want to be sure then you need to go to the grub manual, and or do a google search and find out where (which file) grub stores the UUID. And copy the UUID Then if it doesn't work you can manually install grub and you will have the UUID so you can input it into the grub file.
2010-12-18T10:36:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	That is the latest version of grub. I forget what version it is, but they upgraded grub to the next version on 10.04
2010-12-18T10:40:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	regardless, even if you do grub update, you should dd the grub sectors at the beginning of the hard drive as insurance. Even if grub updat works, you should always dd the grub boot section when modifying the first partition. It was 31 kb for the old grub, but I'm not sure what it is for the grub2
2010-12-18T10:43:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	no. I don't think so. I think you want sbd2 flagged as boot, but even if you get that wrong, you can always easily change that.
2010-12-18T10:47:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	you like to live on the edge heh.... thanks for reporting. I learned something
2010-12-18T10:47:00.000Z	chaospsychex	incognito	no prob
2010-12-18T10:57:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	yeah #windows is the windows support channel. Keep in mind that unless you zero out the drive, the virus will still be there and if you reinstall after reformatting, the virus has a possibility of reinstalling
2010-12-18T10:58:00.000Z	chaospsychex	incognito	im not re-installing windows. im done with that os
2010-12-18T11:00:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	yes I completely understand, but some people like us web developers have to run multiple os's so we can see how our web pages display on microcr#p and such.
2010-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	chaospsychex	incognito	im going to write a virus aimed a windows systems that install ubuntu
2010-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	incognito	chaospsychex	actually, that's an excellent idea! lol
