2011-03-19T21:03:00.000Z	SnowmanX11		Kubuntu Remix 10.10 has brilliant simple surface, but I have a problem with it, actually I am not in a big love with KDE.
2011-03-19T21:04:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 did you install kubuntu-desktop...if so you can go into kde system settings and under one of the menus there you can switch from netbook to desktop
2011-03-19T21:05:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 rather swtich from plasma netbook to regular KDE
2011-03-19T21:05:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	the only problem that I do not want to have KDE at all.
2011-03-19T21:05:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	I just would like to have a Kubuntu Remix like surface for Gnome if it exists
2011-03-19T21:05:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 ah ok... sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop  && sudo apt-get autoremove  kubuntu-desktop plasma-netbook
2011-03-19T21:06:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 ah ok
2011-03-19T21:06:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 well plasma netbook is part of kde desktop package I believe  but if not check in synaptic as was suggested ,,hit  Search type in kubuntu
2011-03-19T21:07:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	I know, that is why I asked for similar look for Gnome.
2011-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 well gnome's  netbook does not look as clever or pretty as the plasma netbook
2011-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	agree
2011-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 the problem with kde is it is far more resource intensive recently
2011-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	but I dislike KDE. I also do not know that much as Gnome
2011-03-19T21:08:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	  I see,,, is this on a desktop or a laptop?
2011-03-19T21:09:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	4 years old cheap desktop
2011-03-19T21:09:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 that should be no problem... I would simply remove kubuntu-desktop and plasma-netbook and install ubuntu-desktop
2011-03-19T21:10:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 then log off or restart then log into the gnome desktop
2011-03-19T21:10:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 understand that the next version of ubuntu 11.04  will have the netbook edition by default on start up if you have ati or intel video
2011-03-19T21:11:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 you would have to log off and choose classic gnome or classic gnome ( no effect) for regular gnome
2011-03-19T21:12:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	I just would like to provide a simple surface with a few big icons to choose the core things that they would use on daily bases and not the whole entire menu (independently from Gnome or KDE)
2011-03-19T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 then go with the gnome netbook edition ...let me see what that is called
2011-03-19T21:13:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 it is called  ubuntu-netbook
2011-03-19T21:14:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	coz_	I know, this is what I use on my netbook. But if you compare to Kubuntu Remix, it has more simple surface than the Gnome Remix version. (or netbook as you call it)
2011-03-19T21:15:00.000Z	coz_	SnowmanX11	 yes , then I am not sure what it is exactly you want
