2006-01-23T09:57:00.000Z	stevenj		I have been reading that dapper is mostly stable for alpha
2006-01-23T09:59:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	"stable" isn't a word I'd use to describe dapper.  "ubuntu-desktop" won't install at the moment for instance.
2006-01-23T10:01:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	I see...I would just like to test it...if I ever get past x server issue.  Also I noticed that I get a lot of errors when doing apt-get update.  Not finding repos or something
2006-01-23T10:01:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	you could try the "flight 3" cd, and update from there
2006-01-23T10:03:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	thats what I have a burned it last night...it installs and then craps out at x-server and resolver
2006-01-23T10:04:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	there were new X packages a few hours ago
2006-01-23T10:04:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	and xserver-xorg won't install at the moment: xserver-xorg: Depends: x11-common but it is not going to be installed
2006-01-23T10:06:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	what are my options remake a cd? Will it be updated?
2006-01-23T10:07:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	you can run dapper, right?  enough to run apt-get and get new packages?
2006-01-23T10:08:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	because I do a sudo apt-get update and it gives me all this "stuff" about cannot find the repos and I even took the 'us' out in the sources.list
2006-01-23T10:08:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	did you see the sources.list I pasted earlier?
2006-01-23T10:08:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	I did not, but I would much like to have it
2006-01-23T10:09:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	I use this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7299
2006-01-23T10:09:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	you can comment out the deb-src lines if you don't use source packages
2006-01-23T10:09:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	thanks
2006-01-23T10:11:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	do I replace my entire sources.list with that?
2006-01-23T10:11:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	yes.  keep a backup just in case, but that's all I ever use
2006-01-23T10:12:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	Oh I see...you just have everything on one line
2006-01-23T10:12:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	I don't see any reason not to put it all on one line.  it makes it much clearer
2006-01-23T10:13:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	yes
2006-01-23T10:19:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	any luck with my sources.list?  did it help?
2006-01-23T10:20:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	I am at my apartment (not at my house) so I only have one box to play with and so I am about to retry
2006-01-23T10:21:00.000Z	dooglus	stevenj	you can use irssi from a virtual console...
2006-01-23T10:22:00.000Z	stevenj	dooglus	nice
