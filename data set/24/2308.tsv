2012-06-08T21:56:00.000Z	nOStahl		hi guys, can i update a system installed on my hd with a live cd chroot?
2012-06-08T21:58:00.000Z	nOStahl		scarlson someone having issue with blank screen?
2012-06-08T21:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	it was jarray52 asking where his driver could be found,  not sure of the details
2012-06-08T22:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	that can normaly be corrected with adding nomodeset in grub kernel boot line
2012-06-08T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	this might have details you need http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132
2012-06-08T22:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	you need to hold shift at boot to get to grub2
2012-06-08T22:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	posibly you have a usb keyboard, if so then grub won't see it unless bios is set to legacy
2012-06-08T22:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	did you HOLD the SHIFT key as it boots?
2012-06-08T22:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	not sure maybe the up down keys or it will still count down?
2012-06-08T22:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	the link above has more details
2012-06-08T22:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	the splash I think is the prity stuf you see at boot otherwise you see text status as it boots
2012-06-08T22:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	again that turns off the text I think
2012-06-08T22:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	so it goes black at the point for starting X then?
2012-06-08T22:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	I would look at what kernel is running on the live cd compared to what they install when on hard disk with uname -a
2012-06-08T22:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	if it's different maybe try install the live cd kernel on the disk,
2012-06-08T22:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	oh and look at the /var/log/syslog file when you boot with the live cd to see what errors might have happened to the display drivers
2012-06-08T22:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	sometimes older is better than newer in the event that doesn't work
2012-06-08T22:28:00.000Z	nOStahl	sacarlson	have to use 10.04 for this software this device will be running.
2012-06-08T22:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	I mean the kernel as I would expect the kernel on the live cd might be older that what they install but not sure
2012-06-08T22:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	oh ok so then you can get backports to those if they worked
2012-06-08T22:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	you can make them yourself not hard to make a custom live cd
2012-06-08T22:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	oh now that you have to do it you will have to think about it,  let someone else do the work for you
2012-06-08T22:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	nOStahl	it would be cool to make a whole wall out of them if you could sync the image to make them all look like one big screen
2012-06-08T22:35:00.000Z	nOStahl	sacarlson	aye, they already can have two displays each. by plugging in an external display too :)
