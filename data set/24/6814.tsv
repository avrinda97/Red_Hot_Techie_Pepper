2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	stisev		why is it EVERYTHING in linux is 100x more complicated and stubborn than it should be?

2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	stisev		I'm trying to get VMware (linux version) to run in a display other than the virtual 640x480
2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	stisev		i've been working for 3 days on this
2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	stisev		STILL can't get it
2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	stisev		:(
2005-07-13T12:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stisev	 considering the amount of time ive worked on windows problems in the past. Linux is trivial. :P
2005-07-13T12:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stisev	 you installed linux under vmware in windows?
2005-07-13T12:54:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	yes
2005-07-13T12:54:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	my main system is win
2005-07-13T12:54:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	linux inside vmware
2005-07-13T12:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stisev	 install the vmware tools then. and use the shell/docs :P  I gave up on vmware ages ago.
2005-07-13T12:54:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	?? I installed vmware tools already
2005-07-13T12:55:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	I'm trying to get it to run a res other than 640x480
2005-07-13T12:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stisev	 then use the shell and use them. dont expect an icon to be there for them.
2005-07-13T12:55:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	what the hell are you talking about?
2005-07-13T12:55:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	Did you even read my questions?
2005-07-13T12:55:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	I *HAVE* linux installed. everything is fine, but I can't get vmware tools to run vmware in any res other than 640x480
2005-07-13T12:56:00.000Z	stisev	Dr_Willis	I've read the manuals/instructions, but I can't seem to figure out what the devil is up :(
2005-07-13T12:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stisev	 may wan tto check the ubuntu wiki's - thats proberly the best place to  find others doing the same thing.
