2005-08-07T06:27:00.000Z	stan-am		sorry im such a newbie...
2005-08-07T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	stan-am	cpan is a perl archive. Do NOT do what windex said.
2005-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego	stan-am	'sudo apt-get install dh-make-perl'
2005-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego	stan-am	Then 'dh-make-perl --cpan XML::Parser'
2005-08-07T06:32:00.000Z	cafuego	stan-am	.. when that finished, you have a new .deb file you can install. it MAY or may not give you errros/warnings when you install it, due to windex'es command failing.
