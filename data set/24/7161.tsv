2005-04-13T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	cheval blanc?
2005-04-13T08:30:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	can u hook me up with this one but in original size ? http://christine.xdev.net/gallery/valthorens/aaw
2005-04-13T08:30:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	just click on it :)
2005-04-13T08:32:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	should be ok, she uploaded it at 1600x1200
2005-04-13T08:33:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	gallery is a cool prog
2005-04-13T08:35:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	yeah... gallery is good =) but i think it would be better with a php script that resizes the 1600x1200 pics.. and save some space on the webserver =) but who cares these days.... mb's are cheap anyway =)
2005-04-13T08:36:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	yeah - I think generally she prob should have resized it, but what the hell :)
2005-04-13T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	just restar the x server if you've changed the config file - simply logging out of x and back in will do
2005-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	you shouldn't kill it no, as it might have been doing something at the time :)
2005-04-17T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	why not tell azureus to set a download limit?
2005-04-17T13:49:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	true. =)
2005-04-17T14:02:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	lmsensors is the suite of sensor software for that sort of thing - can need a bit of fiddling but there are plenty of frontends for pretty displays and selection of sensors etc
2005-04-17T14:04:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	so ur telling me to install lmsensors? and then a frontend that plays with lmsensors? or are the frontends standalone?
2005-04-17T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	yep - lmsensors can tell you info witha  console app, but there are lots of applets etc that use it
2005-04-17T14:14:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	 gdesklets-data - displays and sensors for gdesklets
2005-04-17T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	libben	atually for harddrives, I just remembered there's the tool "hddtemp", I don't know if that has a frontend, but if you just want to check from time to time, that's the thing to use
2005-04-17T14:39:00.000Z	libben	Dr_Aevil	gdesklets-data contained the Lmsensors 0.8 just so u know.
