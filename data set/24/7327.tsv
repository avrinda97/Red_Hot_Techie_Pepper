2005-02-06T17:28:00.000Z	Thybalt		i've had this problem under suse 9.2 pro too
2005-02-06T17:28:00.000Z	Thybalt		and still i had no succes in fixing it
2005-02-06T17:28:00.000Z	Thybalt		i am a beginner in linux but this is the first problem i want to solve
2005-02-06T17:28:00.000Z	Thybalt		so could you help?
2005-02-06T17:29:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	what have you tried to fix it?
2005-02-06T17:30:00.000Z	Thybalt	ApesMa	actually  i haven't tried anything because i don't know much. all i did was to check that the volume wasn't muted
2005-02-06T17:31:00.000Z	Thybalt		wait. i have sound only in front speakers
2005-02-06T17:31:00.000Z	Thybalt		no rear speaker and center and sub
2005-02-06T17:31:00.000Z	ApesMa		OK... so you fired up the "volume control" and checked that it wasn't muted. Did it have separate sliders for the rear/sub?
2005-02-06T17:32:00.000Z	Thybalt	ApesMa	 no
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	does the volume control have an Edit>Preferences selection?
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	Thybalt	ApesMa	 yes it does
2005-02-06T17:34:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	try it. When I click on it, it gives me a checklist of controls to display. See whether rear/center are among them.
2005-02-06T17:34:00.000Z	Thybalt		no. rear/center are missing
2005-02-06T17:36:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	Darn. I saw one for center when I tried it. Must be a function of the drier.
2005-02-06T17:36:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	er, driver. :)
2005-02-06T17:37:00.000Z	Thybalt		the chipset is intel865pe, with onboard sound
2005-02-06T17:37:00.000Z	Thybalt		it was installed by default i guess.
2005-02-06T17:38:00.000Z	ApesMa	Thybalt	I fear that is past my (low) level of expertise.
2005-02-06T17:39:00.000Z	Thybalt	ApesMa	 thank you anyway for your time
