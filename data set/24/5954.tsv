2006-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	UncleD		I'm running breezy. How do i switch my source temporarily to dapper drake?
2006-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	UncleD		dapper i mean
2006-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	UncleD		Im only grabbing a single item
2006-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	that is a recipe for certain destruction
2006-04-04T05:14:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	you might as well switch repos and do apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-04-04T05:14:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	yup
2006-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	.... there's always a chance.. dapper changes rapidly, i get update requests at least once a day
2006-04-04T05:16:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	but I run dapper on both my home machine, and my work laptop, and it seems to run fine.
2006-04-04T05:16:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	ah.
2006-04-04T05:16:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	how much of a download is the upgrade?
2006-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	don't know.. I'm gonna guess about 400 megs worth of stuff. I installed dapper from CD
2006-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	and i've had roughly about 400 megs worth of upgrades in the time since I upgraded.
2006-04-04T05:20:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	All i'm looking to do is install the version of ruby that comes with dapper. How can I change my sources temporarily to do that?
2006-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	trying to install Rails? :-D
2006-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	Rails 1.1 breaks on ruby 1.8.3
2006-04-04T05:22:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	*nod* I need to figure out how to get a rails environment properly running on my laptop when i get a chance
2006-04-04T05:22:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	but I've had to put my rails work on the back burner because my work load is insane.
2006-04-04T05:22:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	(I am developing an ecommerce engine in rails)
2006-04-04T05:22:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	interesting. substruct is the only one ive seen so far.
2006-04-04T05:23:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	substruct isn't really all that interesting....
2006-04-04T05:23:00.000Z	UncleD	TSCHAK	nope, it's pretty limited. It's the only one ive seen though.
2006-04-04T05:23:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	it's really an embeddable engine meant for existing rails projects.
2006-04-04T05:23:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	I'm writing one which uses AJAX extensively for in-place editing of most common functions on the page itself.
2006-04-04T05:24:00.000Z	TSCHAK	UncleD	with a floating administration menu (using what I call a floater icon, which stays in window at all times)
