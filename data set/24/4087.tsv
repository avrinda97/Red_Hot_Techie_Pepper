2007-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	archoniam		Uh hi again. I see the error in this but i don't know how to fix it. The error: I checkinstall anything and this error comes up: /var/tmp/NkDSJgqMeUFmLTWOnegSS/installscript.sh: 4: /home/archoniam/mydocs/el_linux_install_140.zip: Permission denied
2007-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	archoniam		Can anyone tell me what's wrong here?
2007-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	Creeture	archoniam	Probably you need to have root permission. Are you doing sudo checkinstall ....
2007-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	Did sudo or root.
2007-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	The problem is that the file it's talking about, the installscript.sh... it's not there.
2007-07-16T11:49:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	Wait, should i create it again?
2007-07-16T11:49:00.000Z	Creeture	archoniam	installscript.sh is a temporary file that is created by checkinstall and then executed. It's saying that it doesn't have permission to read/write .../el_linux_install_14.zip then the installscript.sh disappears.
2007-07-16T11:50:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	Well, i had all the permission on this computer i could get! I even used sudo WHILE BEING ROOT! Still, i keep getting perm denied. You know the problem there?
2007-07-16T11:51:00.000Z	Creeture	archoniam	It depends on whether it's trying to read or write. I can't tell from what you've told me.
2007-07-16T11:52:00.000Z	Creeture	archoniam	The el_linux.zip file - does it exist? What is it? Why is checkinstall trying to touch it?
2007-07-16T11:52:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	It's trying to write.
2007-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	Yes, it exists. It's my eternal lands game ive been trying to install for about ten minutes.
2007-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	Creeture	archoniam	Try to install it without using checkinstall first. If it works, then troubleshoot checkinstall.
2007-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	Wut? XD | C-{pROF: Wierd, dude. Try sudo login (your login name) . It prompts your password. Enter it. If it dosent work, direct the question to the general public. I'd have no idea from then.
2007-07-16T11:57:00.000Z	archoniam	Creeture	How do i install it without checkinstall? I have no idea here
