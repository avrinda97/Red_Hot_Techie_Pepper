2007-05-20T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	iShock	Just run it off an ubuntu licvecd
2007-05-20T08:38:00.000Z	iShock	cafuego	I tried. I need to resize an NTFS, and it's not working
2007-05-20T08:38:00.000Z	cafuego	iShock	Make sure all partitions are UNmounted (including swap)
2007-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	iShock	cafuego	how?
2007-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	cafuego	iShock	If they shows up as volumes on the desktop, right click 'em and unmount 'em.
2007-05-20T08:39:00.000Z	iShock	cafuego	I shut down computer, insert disk, try and boot it...Shouldn't they be unmounted?
2007-05-20T08:41:00.000Z	cafuego	iShock	On the gparted cd? maybe, I've not used it... no idea.
2007-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	iShock	cafuego	I insert the UBUNTU LIVECD, shut down my computer totally, then boot off the Live cd for UBUNTU. Shouldn't they be unmounted?

2007-05-20T09:00:00.000Z	cafuego	iShock	Maybe I should suggest you use google and seartch for a torrent called hirams ultimate boot cd, which may contain utilities that might be of use to you.
