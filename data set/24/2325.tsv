2009-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	eremite		Hey guys, I've got no audio in my browser, out of the blue.  It was working 5 minutes ago but now its dead.  I get sound from music players etc, still.  This is the third time its happened.  Nothing new has been installed to make this happen, to my knowledge.  Im on Ubuntu Wubi.  Any ideas?
2009-02-23T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	what if you restart your browser?
2009-02-23T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	i'd restart your pc, next time it dies and as soon as it dies run: dmesg | tail
2009-02-23T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	you could also try restarting hal / alsa / pulse
2009-06-23T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	its in here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
2009-06-23T17:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	you will also need to set it in other apps that have their own browser knowledge if they do not tap into the default one (or if you have statically set it in an app)
2009-06-23T17:38:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	this should be as simple as checking a boix.  It has been in every other Opera release.  Im not reading your long-ass link, it doesnt have the info I asked for.
2009-06-23T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	it does if you press ctrl + f and type default
2009-06-23T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	i didnt expect you to read it all

2009-06-23T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	welcome to ignore. you are so ungrateful
2009-07-26T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	not so
2009-07-26T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	frets on fire, penumbra, deusex, doom3 run fantastically
2009-07-26T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	intel video is garbage
2009-07-26T17:45:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	no games work well for me on jaunty, only in Windows.  I hate jaunty for it.
2009-07-26T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	its not jaunty, its the wine team
2009-07-26T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	no, it is a completely seperate app
2009-07-26T17:46:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	I dont use wine for gaming, I play linux native games and still only get 30fps MAX
2009-07-26T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	then its the team who made the game native installer, its a seperate app made by different guys, so is not ubuntu's fault
2009-11-26T20:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	i'd head to offtopic
2009-12-18T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eremite	i use it as it plays nice with my g1 phone :)
2010-03-23T22:31:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	I thought it was just like a basic IM but lacking in most commands and functionality.  I wouldnt know, like I stated in my previous statement, I dont use it.
2010-03-23T22:43:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	somone said to use gksudo instead of sudo for particular tasks.  Do you have a link to info about that?
2010-03-25T18:41:00.000Z	eremite	ActionParsnip	Here's my Ubuntu desktop.  Green green green :)  http://chvnx.com/post/468482521/my-current-ubuntu-desktop-what-does-yours-look
