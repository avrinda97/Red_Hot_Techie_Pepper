2009-11-23T05:45:00.000Z	McLovin		Kream:lspci will show all devices wether or not there is a driver present or not
2009-11-23T05:45:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	thats what i thought. it's not present in lspci. but on the otherhand,it's a troublesome broadcom 4312 one. worked fine in vista until I nuked the windows install
2009-11-23T05:46:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-11-23T05:47:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	lspci will display thee wifi card model and rev 3 or 4 lines from the bottom of the list
2009-11-23T05:48:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	ok
2009-11-23T05:51:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	ill take a look
2009-11-23T05:54:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	funny there is no broadcom showing
2009-11-23T05:54:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 zetheroo apparently, with this model laptop, lspci sometimes does not show the wifi card
2009-11-23T05:57:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	is the wifi switch on ? because that makes no sense to me . ill take a look at a few of my notes and see what i can find. what model of lappy are you using ?
2009-11-23T05:59:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 yes,wifi switch is on
2009-11-23T06:05:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	try this.   "sudo update-pciids"then run lspci again
2009-11-23T06:06:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 no luck
2009-11-23T06:07:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 bizarre bug
2009-11-23T06:08:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	other than that I don't know. Is the lappy a tx series hp ?
2009-11-23T06:08:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 yes, tx1003au
2009-11-23T06:09:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	wha version of ubuntu are you using
2009-11-23T06:10:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 9.10
2009-11-23T06:14:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	im on the run in and out of the office at the moment . try this as well "lspci -vnn" and see what comes up
2009-11-23T06:15:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 no such luck. from the googling i've been doing, it seems that this model is notorious for having problems with the wifi card only intermittently being accessible to linux
2009-11-23T06:17:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	I had a TX1220ca and had the same problem I did have luck getting it to work . try this link because this is not for the same model lappy but it did work for me in the end
2009-11-23T06:17:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 great :) waiting for link
2009-11-23T06:18:00.000Z	McLovin	Kream	forgot to paste it :0
2009-11-23T06:21:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 thanks man :) although, at this point, i feel that its not a problem of finding the right driver, its an underlying hardware problem with the model of laptop
2009-11-23T06:22:00.000Z	Kream	McLovin	 i've never heard of modern hardware that was invisible on the pci bus that started working. did you have the same problem with your hp lappie?
