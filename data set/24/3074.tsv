2009-10-06T22:45:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	do you have real player installed?
2009-10-06T22:47:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	i get GStreamer encountered a general stream error. -- that's on totem. i do have real player installed too
2009-10-06T22:48:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	try to uninstall gstreamer
2009-10-06T22:49:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	real player doesnt even open it - it just hangs
2009-10-06T22:50:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	even though all other files work on it?
2009-10-06T22:51:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	there r loads of gstreamers installed
2009-10-06T22:51:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	i'm trygin to find another way.
2009-10-06T22:56:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	the error message comes with a code of some sort.
2009-10-06T22:56:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	it just says An error occurred. GStreamer encountered a general stream error.
2009-10-06T22:57:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	i have tried removing real player also - same error - btw what's the 'correct' way of installing real player on ubuntu?
2009-10-06T22:57:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	yeah that's what i did - but it seems very small compared to real's binary
2009-10-06T22:59:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	How many MB?
2009-10-06T23:00:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	well the official one on their site is 7.5mb
2009-10-06T23:00:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	- this one seems much smaller
2009-10-06T23:00:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	what's helix player?
2009-10-06T23:00:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	It's a media player
2009-10-06T23:05:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	did you installed helix dna too?
2009-10-06T23:05:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	i installed the real player from real's site and it works - it installed it in /opt - but isn't there a proper way of doing this with a deb file?
2009-10-06T23:12:00.000Z	Ali	McHavok	ok now what?! :)
2009-10-06T23:30:00.000Z	McHavok	Ali	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1022048&highlight=realplayer
