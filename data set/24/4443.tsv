2007-04-25T08:20:00.000Z	Zorlin		freshblue02: What do you need help with
2007-04-25T08:21:00.000Z	freshblueO2	Zorlin	Hello. I am new to ubuntu, and very ameatuer to linux. I have installed 7.04 -Server (amd64) and I am having trouble getting thru the section on "Version Control Systems" in the documentation. Everything else up to this point has been successful. I have tried the subversion package and the cvs package, and I am having problems with both.
2007-04-25T08:21:00.000Z	Zorlin		Hmmm, not sure buddy
2007-04-25T08:21:00.000Z	Zorlin		hang on
2007-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	freshblueO2		https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/version-control-system.html
2007-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Zorlin		!cvs
2007-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Zorlin		!svn
2007-04-25T08:22:00.000Z	Zorlin		Tried tortoise SVN yet?
2007-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	freshblueO2	Zorlin	no. Not yet. The problem with SVN was, two: I could access it thru http, but I would get the error message in my browser...
2007-04-25T08:23:00.000Z	Zorlin	J_a_m_e_s	Not completely sure, but hang on
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	freshblueO2		Could not open the requested SVN filesystem
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		Freshblue02, can you access it through localhost?
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		I'll be honest I'm not great on this subject so I suggest you check the forums or ask someone else
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	freshblueO2		So I skipped http and went down to access it by SVN, and I recieved a different message...
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		try accessing it on HTTP through the localhost address or 127.0.0.1
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		ahhh okay
2007-04-25T08:24:00.000Z	Zorlin		You'll have to post on the ubuntu forums @ ubuntuforums.org
2007-04-25T08:25:00.000Z	freshblueO2		yes, I did. I recieved the same error message
2007-04-25T08:25:00.000Z	Zorlin		Or keep asking around, sorry but I don't know about this stuff..
2007-04-25T08:25:00.000Z	Zorlin		=[ Sorry buddy.
2007-04-25T08:25:00.000Z	freshblueO2	Zorlin	ok, thanks for trying (^_^)
