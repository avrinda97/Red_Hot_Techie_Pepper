2006-11-06T11:45:00.000Z	KTurbo		hello
2006-11-06T11:46:00.000Z	KTurbo		Could someone give me a hand here.
2006-11-06T11:46:00.000Z	KTurbo		I just bought a pc with ubuntu on it. And I wanna know how to make a new user, since I can't login. I have the root + password.
2006-11-06T11:47:00.000Z	KTurbo		I tried to "adduser" but that doesn't work when I try to login
2006-11-06T11:47:00.000Z	KTurbo		Compac? Coould that be it.
2006-11-06T11:47:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	sudo adduser ?
2006-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	does not work how? if it complains about the password you were given, it might be best to ask the people who sold it to you... or boot with a cd and go change it :)
2006-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	call him?
2006-11-06T11:51:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	you are a paying customer to him. But you can also choose the Recovery mode from the grup menu and change the password through that
2006-11-06T11:53:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	man adduser , then just add one for yourself and add it to /etc/sudoers mimicing the limes already there.
2006-11-06T11:54:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	a well installed ubuntu shoul put you into graphical environment by default...
2006-11-06T11:56:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	if you can do sudo, you should already be able to log in x with that very password you use with sudo
2006-11-06T12:00:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	No, useradd [NAME]  if you are in as a root is enough
2006-11-06T12:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	What's a home catalog? Do you mean something related to real estate or home directory?
2006-11-06T12:15:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	it's easiest done by adduser, when making the user, that's why I recommended reading  man adduser  first, but you can just use mkdir /home/yourusername and then copy stuff from skel to there and change the ownership
2006-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	Probably you did not do the chmod part of what I told you...
2006-11-06T12:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	I'll repeat for you, this once
2006-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	chown -r yourusername /home/yourusername
2006-11-06T12:26:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	and even after it: chgrp -r yourusername /home/yourusername
2006-11-06T12:26:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	the first one changes the owner of your newly made home directory and stuff below it, the second changes the group
2006-11-06T12:30:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	if you missed that thing, it's upper case R, not r
2006-11-06T12:32:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	see above
2006-11-06T12:32:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	I got my cases mixed up, sorry about that
2006-11-06T12:33:00.000Z	Lynoure	KTurbo	I'm glad to be of help. Soon going to sneak to watch more DVDs, though.
