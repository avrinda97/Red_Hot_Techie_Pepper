2007-02-15T08:07:00.000Z	yettenet		Are the updating servers slow for you either? :P
2007-02-15T08:08:00.000Z	yettenet		If not, could you give me an adress where I can get the files faster
2007-02-15T08:08:00.000Z	yettenet		8220 here :P
2007-02-15T08:08:00.000Z	m0xie__	yettenet	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change the mirrors from us to ca.   I haven't been able to reliably update fromt he us mirrors in weeks
2007-02-15T08:08:00.000Z	yettenet		:P
2007-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	yettenet		Well, I'm in Europe :)
2007-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	yettenet		But I will try it :)
2007-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	yettenet		What's your usual dl speed, m0xie__ ?
2007-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	m0xie__		Not incredibly fast, but with the us mirrors i was constantly getting stalled connections, etc
2007-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	yettenet		Oh... :P
2007-02-15T08:10:00.000Z	yettenet		Well, then it seems that I'm lucky with my 10k average, right?
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	m0xie__	yettenet	that's a bit slow.. I'd play around with adjusting to other mirrors and see if your speeds increase.
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	yettenet		:)
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	yettenet		Ah
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	yettenet		Fine
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	yettenet		How much do you download with usually, moxie? :P
2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	m0xie__	yettenet	to be honest I haven't noticed.   Let me go try pulling a package down to see.
2007-02-15T08:12:00.000Z	yettenet	mwe	I think they just simply ended
2007-02-15T08:14:00.000Z	m0xie__		I'm getting ~ 150/200k second yettenet
2007-02-15T08:14:00.000Z	yettenet		Oh, damn... then I'm really slow
2007-02-15T08:14:00.000Z	yettenet		This net can handle around 512K/s
2007-02-15T08:15:00.000Z	yettenet		I'll try the canadian one
2007-02-15T08:15:00.000Z	yettenet		So you say that I should change the first part of addresses from xy. to ca., right?
2007-02-15T08:16:00.000Z	m0xie__	yettenet	yes
