2011-11-16T10:15:00.000Z	dejavou42		I need a bit of help, when I turn compiz on my screen appears flipped like this http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/7263/ohgodo.png
2011-11-16T10:17:00.000Z	dejavou42		with compiz off everything looks fine
2011-11-16T10:17:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	awesome!!! do you happen to know if you have some kind of rotation configured with xrandr prior to starting compiz?
2011-11-16T10:18:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	don't believe so
2011-11-16T10:18:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	it seems like some kind of bug in your glx/compiz stack, because no plugin should allow each subwindow to be drawn upside down
2011-11-16T10:19:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	if you run glxgears (when compiz is off) what color gear is on top?
2011-11-16T10:20:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	^^^ not dariushall21
2011-11-16T10:20:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	right and the mouse works correctly too
2011-11-16T10:22:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	i would nuke your .compiz and .compiz-1 folders just in case there is something screwy there, and maybe also do a unity --reset
2011-11-16T10:23:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	let me give it a try
2011-11-16T10:24:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	not finding a .compiz-1 folder
2011-11-16T10:24:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	it would if it exists, you might not have one
2011-11-16T10:25:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	and unity is not installed
2011-11-16T10:26:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	Ok, I renamed .compiz to .comp_old
2011-11-16T10:28:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	you could file a bug, but since you dont have unity, you clearly have an older version of ubuntu. it may have already been fixed in newer versions and just not pushed back to your release
2011-11-16T10:30:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	ok... are you running xubuntu or something? how do you have compiz but no unity?
2011-11-16T10:34:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	when I run unity --reset it tells me command not found
2011-11-16T10:38:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	I was wrong, I am using 10.04,  unity didn't come out till 11 correct?
2011-11-16T10:38:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	right so the compiz support is a lot better from 10.04 -> 11.10 and its probably fixed by now
2011-11-16T10:39:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	you could see if anyone else reported it in launchpad by searching for any closed bugs or try a live cd
2011-11-16T10:40:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	I'm going to hate this in a few minutes but I'll try an upgrade to 11.10
2011-11-16T10:41:00.000Z	escott	dejavou42	before blindly jumping into an upgrade do check the release notes. its a very different desktop system
2011-11-16T10:42:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	that's fine, I've played with 11.10 on another box, but everytime I upgrade, something gets broken
2011-11-16T10:42:00.000Z	dejavou42	escott	I should be able to work through whatever the upgrade throws my way. I've been with ubuntu since 8.04 :)
