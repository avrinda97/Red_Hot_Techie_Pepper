2008-08-14T22:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh		anyone know how to export ntfs over nfs?
2008-08-14T22:46:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	samba
2008-08-14T22:47:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	nfs is SIGNIFCANTLY faster, and uses less processor.
2008-08-14T22:47:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	that's a matter of opinion, and resources.
2008-08-14T22:48:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	you could map the ntfs partition to a share, mount the share, then export it via nfs - not sure how well that would work
2008-08-14T22:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	it's been proven.  and can i setup a samba share in fstab?  so it mounts it on boot?  i want it to be no different than if the drive was mounted locally.
2008-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	yes.
2008-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	that won't work unfortunately
2008-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	what won't work?
2008-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	i guess i'll try samba then
2008-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	map the ntfs partition to a share etc won't work
2010-08-12T01:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	flash sucks.  complain to adobe.  unfortunately not much ubuntu can do about it unless some OSS project sprouts up.  gnash last i tried it was even worse.
2010-08-12T01:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	hrm.  i use the server edition, sorry.  didn't realize that would cause issues with the desktop edition...
2010-08-12T01:27:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	it's okay, I use both. NM has been known to run into problems here and there, while wicd seems to be quite solid when it comes to remembering correct settings.
2010-08-12T01:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	i've found that as well.  i wish NM was as robust as wicd, i don't really like how it looks in the systray :P
2010-08-12T01:31:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	why would you set the gateway on another interface as the gw for a private interface?
2010-08-12T01:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	wth are you talking about?  she's just trying to get a static ip.
2010-08-12T01:32:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	exactly, and please watch your language, this is a family channel.
2010-08-12T01:33:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	it just seems silly that we're both trying to help her - go ahead
2010-08-12T01:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	lol yea it is a little confusing.
2010-08-12T01:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	i just didn't understand why you were talking about internet connection sharing.  seemed to bring a whole nother layer of complexity.
2010-08-12T01:35:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	well, in my experience with setting up an internal ip, the external ip winds up being the 'default' gateway, so no gateway needs to be specified for the internet interface
2010-08-12T01:35:00.000Z	Gnea	arrrghhh	all that needs to be done is to setup ip forwarding
2010-08-12T01:35:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gnea	i guess if you're going straight out to the 'net.  i guess i assumed she's using a router.
