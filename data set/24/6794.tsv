2006-08-22T13:41:00.000Z	Morrowyn		is there something like a linux api for linux, like there is a win32/fx api for windows ?
2006-08-22T13:41:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	sort of
2006-08-22T13:42:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	there is posix, but that's system level
2006-08-22T13:42:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	for gui programming... there are 10 thousand
2006-08-22T13:42:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	XLib is the real low-level one, painful to use and hardly anyone does
2006-08-22T13:42:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	most people use GTK or QT
2006-08-22T13:45:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	of course :P
2006-08-22T13:45:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	if you want to port it to windows, QT would be a better choice
2006-08-22T13:46:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	otherwise the two are fairly similar
2006-08-22T13:46:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	what programming language are you looking at?
2006-08-22T13:47:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	most of the system level stuff should be the same- except case sensitive and we use a slash instead of a backslash
2006-08-22T13:47:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	and there is no registry
2006-08-22T13:48:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	what is the functionality you want?
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	pthread.h
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	for threading
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	Morrowyn	KrakensDen	thanks, ill look into that
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	if you look for any basic linux C++ tutorials
2006-08-22T13:52:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	they should have what you're looking ofr
2006-08-22T13:53:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	or UNIX, for that matter
2006-08-22T13:53:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	or Mac C++
2006-08-22T13:53:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	well, OS X C++
2006-08-22T13:57:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	as a terminally helpful person: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue74/tougher.html  and  http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-sockpit/index.html
2006-08-22T13:57:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	the first is a basic how-to
2006-08-22T13:57:00.000Z	KrakensDen	Morrowyn	the second is what the url says it is
