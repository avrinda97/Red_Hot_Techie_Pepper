2004-12-20T12:41:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	let me make sure you are in the same situation I was first;) it's trying to remove gnome panel right? Because you had some kde stuff installed, it did an upgrade and failed?
2004-12-20T12:42:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	yah, you are in the same situation. It's because of the menus change.
2004-12-20T12:43:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	I fixed it by going to command line and using dpkg -r --remove-all and individually deleting each of the conflicting kde packages.
2004-12-20T12:43:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	then I dist-upgraded and gnome fixed itself.
2004-12-20T12:44:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	It's a gigantic PITA.
2004-12-20T12:44:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	the menus are completely screwed right now. They are gnome default. I still have my panels, but the applications and actions menu are totally different.
2004-12-20T12:45:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	well, you can try to use it like it is, but it might be unstable...
2004-12-20T12:46:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	what kde stuff do you have installed anyway?
2004-12-20T12:47:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	then just use dpkg to delete the kde stuff that is conflicting. You'll have to do that eventually anyway.
2004-12-20T12:47:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	if you do an apt-get dist-upgrade it will tell you what is conflicting. Don't let it go through with it though.
2004-12-20T12:49:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	apt-get dist-upgrade first, don't let it go through with it, note what kde stuff is conflicting, dpkg -r --force-all package name, then dist-upgrade again, note what that borked on the kde side, then dpkg -r --force-all those packages
2004-12-20T12:50:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	I don't know what the -f will do. Just don't let dist-upgrade actually go through with it until you get rid of the kde stuff.
2004-12-20T12:52:00.000Z	billytwowilly	|QuaD-	oh.. apt is already borken then... Do you remember what package the gnome-menus package conflicted with? I think it was kdelibs-data
2004-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	|QuaD-	billytwowilly	when i installed 2.6.9, x wouldn't work cuz nvidia drivers not compiled for it
