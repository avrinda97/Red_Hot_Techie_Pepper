2005-07-10T10:28:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	what IRC client is that?
2005-07-10T10:28:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	it's Gaim LOL
2005-07-10T10:29:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	I dont think Gaim is perfect for IRC though
2005-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	I use X-Chat.
2005-07-10T10:30:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	yeah it's much better with all more powerful color highlight
2005-07-10T10:31:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	how come it's painful?
2005-07-10T10:33:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	because nothing is QUITE perfect. X-Chat looks a little odd, and KDE doesn't want to see Gaim as a real IM client (it's quite insistent on Kopete). And, while I prefer the something-ness of the KDE interface, there's something missing.
2005-07-10T10:33:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	and kynaptic really sux0rz.
2005-07-10T10:34:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	yeah I had that problem too, man. But I tried to stick with Gnome, although i use Kile a lot for all my Tex typesetting stuffs
2005-07-10T10:35:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	KDE just seems a little smoother to me for some reason...
2005-07-10T10:35:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	I absolutely agree
2005-07-10T10:35:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	it looks much better hehe!
2005-07-10T10:36:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	I'm using Xchat now, hehe... I just love apt-get so much!
2005-07-10T10:38:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	and?
2005-07-10T10:38:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	What do you think of it??
2005-07-10T10:39:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	Game doesn't have that nice coloring
2005-07-10T10:39:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	I mean Gaim
2005-07-10T10:41:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	the biggest problem I have with KDE is not being able to press Ctrl+F4 to close a Firefox tab :)
2005-07-10T10:41:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	yeah that's true
2005-07-10T10:41:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	can you redefine it?
2005-07-10T10:42:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	See, I haven't seen where that particular shortcut is defined.
2005-07-10T10:43:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	yeah? Did you really mean closing Tab or closing the whole firefox? Because closing I believe is Ctrl+W
2005-07-10T10:44:00.000Z	SQFreak	daile	closing tab. i use Ctrl+F4 on Windows Firefox.
2005-07-10T10:45:00.000Z	daile	SQFreak	yeah but I think Ctrl+W always works anyway in closing Firefox's tab
