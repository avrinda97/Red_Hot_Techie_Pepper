2006-06-04T16:31:00.000Z	ompaul	SurfnKid	file and file~ are two different files, usually one is a backup of the the other, if it is ~/file and file that has to do with the location on the hard disk ~yourusername/ is shorthand for your home directory, /home/yourusername/file and ~yourusername/file are the same thing
2006-06-04T16:33:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ompaul	ill have to get used to the ~ before and after to determine what it means but so far I wont touch the backup file
