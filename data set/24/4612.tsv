2007-04-02T10:01:00.000Z	n0cTurNuLL		can the dapper drake can detect the network immediately??
2007-04-02T10:01:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	it should
2007-04-02T10:02:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	try the Live CD, it doesn't install and you get to see it before installing it
2007-04-02T10:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	I think you'll need edgy
2007-04-02T10:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	edgy is the latest release of Ubuntu, but its not Long Term Support
2007-04-02T10:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	no, you will have to install it
2007-04-02T10:06:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	its not a problem just come here or to #beryl for help
2007-04-02T10:17:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	Edgy is supposed to be faster then Dapper because of new memory management
2007-04-02T10:18:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	no, all im saying is that performance wise, they are comparable
2007-04-02T10:19:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	these guyz are usually even better help for ubuntu users ;-)
2007-04-02T10:20:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	? why?
2007-04-02T10:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	what would I do with it?
2007-04-02T10:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	what ubuntu you use isn't really the question, what Window Manager you use might
2007-04-02T10:21:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	xubuntu uses a lighter Window Manager
2007-04-02T10:23:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	you can change about everything
2007-04-02T10:25:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	type Ubuntu edgy beryl in youtube
2007-04-02T10:25:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	you can download the ISOs
2007-04-02T10:26:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	all you have to do is burn them
2007-04-02T10:26:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	okay ;-)
2007-04-02T10:28:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	1 CD, so around 700 megz
2007-04-02T10:47:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	where do you live?
2007-04-02T10:48:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	WHERE do you live (approximatively)
2007-04-02T10:49:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-04-02T11:12:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	n0cTurNuLL	no problem
