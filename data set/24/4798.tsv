2007-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	you still around
2007-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	did you install the nvidia binary drivers?
2007-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	but the 5xxxx series of FX is like an updated geforce 4 card :)
2007-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	I don't know. I'm using whatever was installed when I installed Ubuntu
2007-05-27T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	do glxinfo and see what it says for vendor
2007-05-27T16:30:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	SGI
2007-05-27T16:30:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	ok you need to install the nvidia binary
2007-05-27T16:30:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	please say it's as easy as an apt-get
2007-05-27T16:31:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	yeah hang on a sec checking something
2007-05-27T16:31:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	I've had problems with X for so many years...if this is going to make X unusable I'll deal with the slow framerate :)
2007-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx and then gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf change nv to nvidia
2007-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	then reboot?
2007-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	then restart X with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or you can ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-05-27T16:33:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	ok, be right back I hope
2007-05-27T16:33:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	thanks!

2007-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	what I'm seeing there is how to install from a usb drive...I was hoping to install onto a flash drive etc...am I just not reading carefully enough?
2007-08-07T05:02:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	well you can install the livecd to a flash drive
2007-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	I've never run the LiveCD...can I create documents etc and save them to the flash drive then?
2007-08-07T05:03:00.000Z	kitche	wepeel	you should be able to
2007-08-07T05:04:00.000Z	wepeel	kitche	ok, I'll give it a try. Thanks!
