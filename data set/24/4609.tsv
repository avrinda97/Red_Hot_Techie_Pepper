2007-02-26T06:30:00.000Z	stutsman		OKay for those of you who remember me from yesterday: I was able to set up a dual boot situation with Windows XP on one drive and Ubunu on the other... now I'm COMPLETELY new to ubuntu and Linux... is there a way I can get ubuntu to allow me to access my windows hard drive so that I can play mp3s from that drive or access other files from that drive?
2007-02-26T06:31:00.000Z	stutsman		I believe the windows drive is ntfs
2007-02-26T06:33:00.000Z	stutsman		There is no way for me to make it fat32 without loosing everything is there?
2007-02-26T06:33:00.000Z	stutsman		read only is ok though... that will allow me to access the files right... like play mp3s and such?
2007-02-26T06:34:00.000Z	stutsman		ok... thats all I need to do then. But for some reason it won't let me browse. I have no clue to gain access to it.
2007-02-26T06:35:00.000Z	stutsman		ok ok...
2007-02-26T06:35:00.000Z	stutsman		I think read access is really all I need for now... if I later decided I need write access I might try though....
2007-02-26T06:35:00.000Z	stutsman		So how do I gain access to that drive then from Ubuntu?
2007-02-26T06:36:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	there are no stable cross-platform file systems for write access
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	means it can't connect to your local xserver
2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	I am soooo lost
2007-02-26T07:04:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	xhost + and then set your DISPLAY variable
2007-02-26T07:05:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	when I use that command I get another error -         xhost:  unable to open display ""
2007-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	are you root ?
2007-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	why are you root - your not ment to use the root account
2007-02-26T07:07:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	The short answer is that I"m root because I guess I really didn't know any better. I'm completely new to this all.
2007-02-26T07:07:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	then read the docs on ubuntu.com and ubotu links to learn
2007-02-26T07:09:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	thank you... I will read this.
2007-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	but the instructions for this nfts-3g thing just go right over my head
2007-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	just mount it read only then - you don't need ntfs3g for that
2007-02-26T08:46:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	how do I go about doing that though? I can see the drive, but it won't let me access it.
2007-02-26T08:46:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	man mount
2007-02-26T08:46:00.000Z	ikonia	stutsman	everything you need it built in aleady
2007-02-26T08:48:00.000Z	stutsman	ikonia	ok but how do I do that?
