2010-01-10T16:34:00.000Z	naoshige		Hello. I'm using Ubuntu Hardy, but when I apt-get install ruby I get Ruby 1.8.6 instead of 1.8.7. I tried doing apt-get update, but with no luck. What can I do?
2010-01-10T16:35:00.000Z	naoshige		I'm on a "production" server hosting a lot of websites and I can't disrupt those services.
2010-01-10T16:35:00.000Z	nick125	naoshige	Maybe find a PPA/repo that has a newer version of Ruby for Hardy?
2010-01-10T16:40:00.000Z	naoshige	nick125	PPA/repo?
2010-01-10T16:40:00.000Z	nick125	naoshige	An external package repository
