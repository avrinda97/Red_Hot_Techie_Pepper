2006-06-16T07:16:00.000Z	Geev8		am a user of ubuntu
2006-06-16T07:16:00.000Z	Geev8		i need help
2006-06-16T07:18:00.000Z	Geev8		when am copping file from my computer to any floppy or flash disk it display an error "error while copying to /media/floppy
2006-06-16T07:18:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	Is it a permission thing do you think?
2006-06-16T07:19:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	You need to edit /etc/fstab as super user ("gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"), tell me when you have it open
2006-06-16T07:21:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	Is there a line about the floppy drive there (/dev/fd0)?
2006-06-16T07:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	Is there a line with "/dev/fd0" in it? (that is your floppy drive)
2006-06-16T07:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	In the "option" column for it (the bit with rw,user,noauto) add "uid=yourusername" (where yourusername is obviously your actual user name)
2006-06-16T07:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	You need to put a comma between it and the ones already there
2006-06-16T07:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	As an example here is my /etc/fstab line for the floppy drive "/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,uid=chris  0       0"
2006-06-16T07:32:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	this is the line for me "/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0" edit it i will copy it
2006-06-16T07:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	I cannot edit it without knowing your username, so what is your username on your computer?
2006-06-16T07:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	OK, so the line should look like this: "/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,uid=t01  0       0"
2006-06-16T07:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	That should sort out the floppy drive (try it) but I am still thinking about the USB drive (it is handled in a slightly different way)
2006-06-16T07:47:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	do i need to restart my computer
2006-06-16T07:47:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	in order changes to take effect
2006-06-16T07:48:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	No, just unmount any floppy that you have mounted at the moment and remount it
2006-06-16T07:48:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	ok
2006-06-16T07:53:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	i unmounted the re mounted my floppy but still it give the some error
2006-06-16T07:54:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	"You do not have permmisions to write to this folder"
2006-06-16T07:54:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	That's weird. Maybe it is to do with gnome-volume-manager or HAL. It should DEFINETLY work with the command "sudo mount /dev/fd0", but that shouldn't really be necessary...
2006-06-16T08:00:00.000Z	Geev8	Warbo	so do i need to logon as root or
2006-06-16T08:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Geev8	If you unmount the floppy then type into a terminal "sudo mount /dev/fd0" then it should give permission (you will find it in /media/floppy0)
