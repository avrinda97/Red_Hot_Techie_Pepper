2008-11-16T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	they should already be installed
2008-11-16T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	if you go into the system menu, you'll see an administraiton menu, then a hardware drivers menu
2008-11-16T00:14:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	you should be able to enable it in there
2008-11-16T00:15:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	what video card do you have ?
2008-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	in the menu do you see any drivers available for use ?
2008-11-16T00:16:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	thats right
2008-11-16T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	can you please pastebin the output of the command "lspci" please.

2008-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	what's the url
2008-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	your using vmware
2008-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	thats why it's not seeing an nvidia card
2008-11-16T00:46:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	there is no direct hardware access in vmware
2008-11-16T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	so your virtual machine can't see an nvidia video card, just a virtual card
2008-11-16T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	00:0f.0 VGA compatible controller: VMware Inc Abstract SVGA II Adapter
2008-11-16T00:49:00.000Z	DiiPhantom	ikonia	 oh ok, so i guess i have to install it directly into the hardrive to acually TRY ubuntu itself eh?
2008-11-16T00:49:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	if you want
2008-11-16T00:51:00.000Z	DiiPhantom	ikonia	 but i can still install themes without the video card drivers right?
2008-11-16T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	DiiPhantom	the drivers are built into the kernel, so you already have them
2008-11-16T01:04:00.000Z	DiiPhantom	ikonia	Where can i go to install themes?
