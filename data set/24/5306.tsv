2006-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	angel12		hey guys, ive got what seems to be a major network problem. whenever i try to apt-get something, i get a cannot find archive.ubuntu.com, but when i ping it, its there, and then apt-get works. then whenever i try to connect to irc in xchat, i have to ping irc.freenode.net first, otherwise it sees irc.freenode.net as 1.0.0.0
2006-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	fokuslee	angel12	u have dns problem
2006-12-17T07:04:00.000Z	angel12	fokuslee	any idea how to fix it? i figured thats what it was
