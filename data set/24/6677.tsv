2006-07-02T05:54:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		i just installed ubuntu, i am new to the linux community, and i am having trouble connecting to my dsl modem, can anybody help ?
2006-07-02T05:54:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		nothing actually, i click on the firefox application and i get the ubuntu documentation page, i cant access any websites
2006-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		i went into network settings and tried to tinker with it, it wont let me connect
2006-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	ProN00b	Stergiosaurus	why not call your isp and ask them how to use their service on linux ?
2006-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	ProN00b	Stergiosaurus	how did you connect on windows ?
2006-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		i just plug it into the ethernet port and it connects
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		no
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	ProN00b	Stergiosaurus	and that works even after you reinstall windows ? or do you have to set something up ?
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		its not windows
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		my windows box is fine, im on it right now
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		its my ubuntu computer
2006-07-02T05:56:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		i just installed ubuntu on one of my computers
2006-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		im new to linux
2006-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	ProN00b	Stergiosaurus	i am just asking because if you need to set up something on your windows, you need to set up the same thing on linux
2006-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		i plugged in my ethernet cable from my dsl modem
2006-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus		as i ususally do with my windows box

2006-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	Stergiosaurus	maddy	it asks me for ip subnet and gateway

2006-07-02T05:59:00.000Z	ProN00b	Stergiosaurus	actually you don't have to get them from windows, you can just set dhcp
