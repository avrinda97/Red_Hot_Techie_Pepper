2008-02-08T22:34:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	no, your professor assuming that everyone is going to pay for commercial tools is ... a tool.
2008-02-08T22:35:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	no, it's not.
2008-02-08T22:37:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	but that's not the fault of open source software. that's the fault of a professor choosing to distribute work in a non-standard file format that requires non-free tools to open.
2008-02-08T22:37:00.000Z	HorizonXP	mneptok	Are PDFs not open?
2008-02-08T22:38:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	PDFs with pop-up yellow post-it note bubbles to indicate edits certainly are not.
2008-02-08T22:39:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	"embrace, extend, extinguish." your yellow Post-It pop-ups represent the "extend" part of the formula. :)
2008-02-08T22:40:00.000Z	HorizonXP	mneptok	ok, then how's this: is there an open source competitor to PDFs?
2008-02-08T22:41:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	not so much "closed source" as "not open and not thoroughly documented"
2008-02-08T22:42:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	file a feature request with Evince. that is bad bahavior.
2008-02-08T22:42:00.000Z	HorizonXP	mneptok	do you have a link? I'll do it right now
2008-02-08T22:43:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/
2008-02-08T22:45:00.000Z	mneptok	HorizonXP	np np. thanks for filing feature requests rather than just saying "this sucks!" ;)
2008-02-08T22:46:00.000Z	HorizonXP	mneptok	it does suck :P but i'll help make it not suck. i love ubuntu, i just get frustrated when it doesn't do things I don't like. which is rare. and usually quickly fixed, hahah!
2008-02-08T22:50:00.000Z	HorizonXP	mneptok	Bug #515243, filed :)
