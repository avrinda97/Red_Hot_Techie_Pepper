2010-08-10T07:25:00.000Z	johnhamelink		hey there, i'm trying to get the wireless working on my samsung n130 netbook. I have it working but it sometimes times out, and sometimes it takes ages to resolve domains. It takes next to no time to access local IPs
2010-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	google bind9 cache config
2010-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	will do
2010-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	I'm not sure what to do with this? What are you suggesting I do?
2010-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	i am suggesting dns caching with bind9. It will cache websites that you commonly use in a dns cache.
2010-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	do you have a love for firefox or are you willing to switch to chromium?
2010-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	is there no way to actually fix the problem I'm having with the wireless? (ethernet is perfect)
2010-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	I use chromium already ;)
2010-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	then DNS caching is your best bet. If you visit google.com alot, then it keeps the ip address to google.com in the cache and doesn't reconnect to the dns server every request, just every time the cache link expires.
2010-08-10T07:31:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	i guess you're right
2010-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	for whatever reason, Ubuntu's networking mechanism seems to be incompetent in terms of its dns caching capibilities
2010-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	I've been trying to get past this annoying limitation for the past 2.5 hours, you have given me a silver lining of sorts :P
2010-08-10T07:33:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	aah - this is a netbook :S
2010-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	then in edit connections, select wireless -> your wireless access point -> edit -> IPv4 Settings, set method to automatic dhcp addresses only, and set the dns servers to "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
2010-08-10T07:36:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	result! I actually tried that with opendns instead of google's dns. For some annoying reason it works now!
2010-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	wow, epic fail - i left my ethernet cable in >.< Yeah there's no difference
2010-08-10T07:40:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	uhh...
2010-08-10T07:41:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	just like my dad says: they never tell you the whole story. You may end up charging 300 dollars just to change a light bulb (he did that once)
2010-08-10T07:41:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	sorry, what context do you mean? ^.^
2010-08-10T07:42:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	your dns issues
2010-08-10T07:42:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	aah I see :P
2010-08-10T07:45:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	im off to bed, its 3:44 here
2010-08-10T07:45:00.000Z	johnhamelink	rallias	thanks for your help, i'll keep at it :)
2010-08-10T07:46:00.000Z	rallias	johnhamelink	no problem
