2010-09-16T09:15:00.000Z	twoshot_		There's a router cd that I'm trying to use. I try to run setup.exe in wine and it says it's not executable. but when i chmod it it says the disc is read only
2010-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	if it's a setup cd, you could probably do it without the CD
2010-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	twoshot_	Datz	by going to 192.168.0.1 or something
2010-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	yea
2010-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	run "ifconfig"

2010-09-16T09:18:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	to the router?

2010-09-16T09:20:00.000Z	twoshot_	Datz	doesn't ifconfig just output info
2010-09-16T09:20:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	can you bring up the router's page?
2010-09-16T09:20:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	I was going to help you find the gateway
2010-09-16T09:21:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	what is the problem anyway?
2010-09-16T09:22:00.000Z	twoshot_	Datz	ifconfig shows only eth0 lo
2010-09-16T09:23:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	run "route" find gateway there
2010-09-16T09:24:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	you see more than one gateway?
2010-09-16T09:26:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	there shouldn't be
2010-09-16T09:26:00.000Z	twoshot_	Datz	there are four for the interface eth0

2010-09-16T09:28:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	then use the one with the number
2010-09-16T09:30:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	sounds like your brother knows how to set it up.
2010-09-16T09:30:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	what kind of internet connection do you have there?
2010-09-16T09:31:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	as in DSL, Cable..etc
2010-09-16T09:32:00.000Z	Datz	twoshot_	ok, If it were cable I would tell you just to plug it in and it might work.. otherwise.. you'll need more info to set it up.
