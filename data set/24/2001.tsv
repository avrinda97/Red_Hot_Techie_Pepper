2009-05-25T00:13:00.000Z	thoku	winterelf	1. what graphics card do you have? 2. Have you enabled proprietary drivers?
2009-05-25T00:14:00.000Z	winterelf	thoku	i have intel x3100 and  i don't know to enable anything, i m new in ubuntu
2009-05-25T00:16:00.000Z	thoku	winterelf	ah ok. Not sure what you need to do with an intel GPU. I don't think there are proprietary drivers for it on Linux. Have you tried googling?

2009-05-25T00:17:00.000Z	winterelf	thoku	hmmm.. intel x3100 is not a rare graphics card, almost every 1 of 4 people has it, and still ...
2009-05-25T00:18:00.000Z	thoku	winterelf	it should work by default then. All common hardware does.
2009-05-25T00:19:00.000Z	thoku	winterelf	I presume you have to tried to enable Visual Effects in Appearance but have no luck?
2009-05-25T00:19:00.000Z	winterelf	thoku	how should i do that?
2009-05-25T00:19:00.000Z	thoku		anyone know of some good video editing software? Avidemux is a bust with the OGV
2009-05-25T00:20:00.000Z	thoku	winterelf	System -> Preference -> Appearance -> Visual Effects
2009-05-25T00:20:00.000Z	thoku		*Preferences
