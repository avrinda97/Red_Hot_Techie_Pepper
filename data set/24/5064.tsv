2007-09-02T09:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	markelhas	reboot and from grub choose 'memtest' - you'll likely find you have memory problems, maybe
2007-09-02T09:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	markelhas	then check your bios settings for memory timings
2007-09-02T09:59:00.000Z	markelhas	Frogzoo	i've done that and no problems found
