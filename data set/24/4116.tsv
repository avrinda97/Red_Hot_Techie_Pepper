2007-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	numus		i am to confused
2007-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	numus		Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
2007-07-10T05:40:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	java works fine in ubuntu - if you want the jdk rather than just the vm then install it, the package is sun-java6-jdk, it's in multiverse.  You can switch between diff versions of java using the update-alternatives tool
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	and your problem is then?
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	numus	NigelS	it doesn't work in firefox
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	are you sure this isn't because you're running it in a vm?
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	have you googled to see if this might have come up?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	yep?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	if you type update-alternatives --config java
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	what does it list?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	well you've selected 1.5 right there, press 3 to choose java 6
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	put sudo in front of it
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	if you ls -al /usr/lib/firefox/plugins what do you see?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	do you see the libjava lib?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	and where does it point?
2007-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	ok, and there are no other java plugins in there?
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	right, there sould only be one really - move all bit the first one you spammed out of the plugin folder and restart firefox.  If it still doesn't register your hava plugin then a good approach would be to try deleting pluginreg.dat to force it to recache the plugin folder
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	don't copy
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	use move, mv
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	rm
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	ta-da
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	yeah, ff doesn't cope with multiple versions in its plugin folder
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	I mean it could arguably be a bug that they weren't removed by update-alternatives but I think maybe those pckages never worked well with it? who knows
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	NigelS	numus	np
