2009-01-16T10:29:00.000Z	zetheroo		how do I change the permissions of a folder in the failsafe terminal?
2009-01-16T10:29:00.000Z	zetheroo		I need it to be 644 and owned by a user called rachael
2009-01-16T10:30:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	chmod
2009-01-16T10:36:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	sudo chown -R rachel:rachel rachel && sudo chmod -R 644 rachel
2009-01-16T10:37:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	make that: sudo chown -R rachel:rachel rachel && sudo chmod 644 rachel
2009-01-16T10:42:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	I think I just told you
2009-01-16T10:44:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	rachael?  not rachel?  If so, then: chown -R rachael:rachael /home/rachael && chmod -R 644 /home/rachael
2009-01-16T10:47:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	what exactly was changed?
2009-01-16T10:48:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	then change it back.  sudo mv /home/rachel /home/rachael
2009-01-16T10:49:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	I know.  Did you type what I gave you?
2009-01-16T10:51:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	then she can;t have changed her home dir to rachel
2009-01-16T10:53:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	oh I see.  Sorry for the confusion.  You want usermod then.
2009-01-16T10:53:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	usermod -d /home/rachael rachael
2009-01-16T10:56:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	no, just log in again
2009-01-16T10:58:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	ask her to type: ls /home       and see what her home dir is actually called
2009-01-16T11:00:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	I don't understand.  /home/rachael exists but usermod is saying it doesn't?
2009-01-16T11:02:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	must have mistyped it
2009-01-16T11:03:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	you're welcome
2009-01-16T11:07:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	no
2009-10-31T08:33:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	You need the alternate CD to upgrade without an internet connection, otherwise use the command do-release-upgrade.  Alternatively, do a fresh install with a live CD
2009-10-31T08:34:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	you can upgrade from within jaunty
2009-10-31T08:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	jken146	with the ISO I have?
2009-10-31T08:35:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	no
2009-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	jken146	zetheroo	because of the way live-bootable CDs work
