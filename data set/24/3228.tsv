2008-03-27T15:55:00.000Z	simplyubuntu		can anyone help me configure a modem in ubuntu... finding it difficult
2008-03-27T15:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	USB or serial? Using wvdial?
2008-03-27T15:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	what error/problem are you getting?
2008-03-27T15:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	hmm
2008-03-27T16:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	can you pastebin the output from wvdial and /etc/wvdial.conf (edit out personal details) ?
2008-03-27T16:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	it's been a while, but I may spot something :)
2008-03-27T16:07:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	just stick the number infront of the number?
2008-03-27T16:09:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	there should be a way to make it wait (looking at man wvdial)
2008-07-01T12:29:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	is it listed in  /media
2008-07-01T12:30:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	yes there is cdrom0 in media but nothing in it
2008-07-01T12:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	yeah, can't hurt
2008-07-01T12:32:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	what was?
2008-07-01T12:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	, faulty disk or drive is my only thought atm
2008-07-01T12:33:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	thought so too. its probably the drive. plays some dvds
2008-07-01T12:33:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	what's weird is that my macbooks dvd rive is also not working
2008-07-01T12:35:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	a lot of cd drive related issues atm don't you think?
2008-07-01T12:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	*nods*
2008-07-01T12:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	yeah, that is a bit odd
2008-07-01T12:36:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	could it have something to do with an update?
2008-07-01T12:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	possible, I did get a 24-19 kernel update when I already had that *shrugs*
2008-07-01T12:41:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	should I try mounting manually?
2008-07-01T12:43:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	no medium found... guess not
2008-07-01T12:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	simplyubuntu	bummer, sorry. Try the disk elsewhere, if it works it's your drive
2008-07-01T12:46:00.000Z	simplyubuntu	DistroJockey	when in doubt restart :)
