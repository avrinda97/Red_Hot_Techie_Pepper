2009-11-28T03:15:00.000Z	reactor16		any help me to install tun/tap driver into ubuntu x64 ?
2009-11-28T03:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	sudo modprobe tun
2009-11-28T03:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	which error?
2009-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	can you load any other modules?
2009-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	try sudo modprobe snd
2009-11-28T03:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	did you create /etc/modprobe.conf?
2009-11-28T03:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	do you have /etc/modprobe.conf?
2009-11-28T03:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	it's /etc/modprobe.conf
2009-11-28T03:25:00.000Z	reactor16	lstarnes	its empty
2009-11-28T03:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	try removing it using sudo rm /etc/modprobe.conf
2009-11-28T03:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	are you using ubuntu within a VPS?
2009-11-28T03:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	you'll have to check with your vps's owners
2009-11-28T03:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	there might be a way to recheck the module dependencies
2009-11-28T03:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	however, that is a rather old kernel and it likely has some modifications to it so that that it will work in a VPS
2009-11-28T03:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	probably not
2009-11-28T03:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	try running module-assistant
2009-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	it manages modules
2009-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	no
2009-11-28T03:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	it's module-assistant, not ./module-assistant
2009-11-28T03:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	what error?
2009-11-28T03:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	you'll need to contact your VPS's providers to fix the issue
2009-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	they probably installed a modified kernel in your VPS so that it will work with the virtualization software
2009-11-28T03:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	reactor16	it's probably some weird configuration of modprobe
2009-11-28T03:40:00.000Z	reactor16	lstarnes	thx man
