2007-04-21T15:09:00.000Z	exs		hi guys, is there any easy-to-use linux app that allows me to completely clone my laptops hard drive, so that - if it goes wrong, I am able to put it all back, *exactly* how it was before? .. I have a couple of USB hard drive and I'm hoping to be able to do this (I'm going to upgrade to feisty)
2007-04-21T15:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	dd
2007-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	it's already installed, it's a standard tool, $ man dd
2007-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 ringo hmm, I think you're over judging my intelligence... I don't like command line stuff. The more I can avoid it the better.
2007-04-21T15:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	you're not going to find anything simpler than dd
2007-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	if you can't work out dd then I doubt you can work out an equivalent gui, if such a thing exists
2007-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 uhm, so you're saying linux has no GUI based partition backup tool?
2007-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	there likely is, but i've never looked for one
2007-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=backup
2007-04-21T15:13:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 ok ok... so, if I do successfully backup my linux whole HD to my USB HD, how do i put it back if it goes wrong? (as in, command etc)
2007-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	$ sudo if=backup of=/dev/sda
2007-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 does DD have documentation?
2007-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	man dd
2007-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	you can combine it with gzip to compress the images too
2007-04-21T15:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	do you want to backup the whole drive or just one partition?
2007-04-21T15:17:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 I don't really mind... I have a blank hard drive.
2007-04-21T15:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	what exactly do you want to backup?
2007-04-21T15:18:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 my whole laptops hd
2007-04-21T15:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	ok, so the entire hdd
2007-04-21T15:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	it won't take forever, it'll just be however long it takes to read the entire disk
2007-04-21T15:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	mount the new drive, cd into it, $ sudo if=/dev/hda of=hdabackup bs=1M
2007-04-21T15:19:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 ringo ok, well before all of this, I need to format my usb hard drive
2007-04-21T15:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	exs	be back later? it takes a few minutes to format a drive
2007-04-21T15:20:00.000Z	exs	dystopianray	 yeah, back later as in, 5 minutes or so
