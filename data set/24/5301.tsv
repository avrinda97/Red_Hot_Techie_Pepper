2006-10-07T11:10:00.000Z	JoshIRL		I have a HP pavilion a705w, the processor is a 2.93 ghz intel celeron (R) and it wont install ubuntu, why? It gets to the beggining at booting the kernel (right after you click start) and it just kills the pc, and reboots.. helpy?
2006-10-07T11:10:00.000Z	JoshIRL		^anyone else wanna take a stab?
2006-10-07T11:10:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	hmm, throttle the CPU down if you can
2006-10-07T11:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	make it slower than 2.93GHz
2006-10-07T11:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	is it desktop or laptop?
2006-10-07T11:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	in the BIOS setup does it have a "timer" or "bus speed" option?
2006-10-07T11:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	that's the letter o not number 0 in my nick :)
2006-10-07T11:12:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	what's the model name again?
2006-10-07T11:12:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	I assume it's a Pentium 4 for the processor, the PC
2006-10-07T11:14:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	I pity you
2006-10-07T11:15:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	ooh you're gonna likey 95 on that hardware, I know I've tried :)
2006-10-07T11:15:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	nope.
2006-10-07T11:15:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	that's what I mean, what idiot at HP made a non-Linux-friendly PC?
2006-10-07T11:27:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	really?  Coolness!
2006-10-07T11:28:00.000Z	AWOSDev	JoshIRL	yeah, you'll love Ubuntu.  I know I do :)
