2007-03-04T17:43:00.000Z	dougb		Does Ubuntu have the DST bug like Windows has?
2007-03-04T17:43:00.000Z	dougb		seriously, $4,000 for a patch?
2007-03-04T17:44:00.000Z	dougb		they call it a "bug" but it's changing the hard coded date set to change clocks for DST, since Bush changed it to be a few weeks earlier, not all OS's are aware of this and won't update the time accordingly
2007-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	Run 'date -d "March 27"' in a terminal.
2007-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	If it says xDT instead of xST, you're fine.
2007-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	Debian has the updated tzdata package, so I'm sure that Ubuntu does as well.
2007-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	dougb		yea, it showed xDT
2007-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	You're fine then.
2007-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	dougb		it wasn't a big deal, I just thought how Microsoft is charging $4k to "fix" the bug is ridiculous
2007-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	Say what?  $4,000?
2007-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	jlgaddis		Whoever told you that is lying.
2007-03-04T17:47:00.000Z	dougb		yeah jlgaddis, and they dropped the price from $40k

2007-03-04T17:48:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	I manage Windows Servers for a .edu and have been dealing with this for the last few months.  I can state, definitively, that Microsoft is *NOT* charging to fix the "bug".
2007-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	dougb		Depends how old your software is jlgaddis
2007-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	If you're running crap older than Windows 2000, perhaps.
2007-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	They're providing fixes for everything from Win2K and later.
2007-03-04T17:50:00.000Z	dougb		Windows 2k isn't included actually "Among the titles in that extended support category are Windows 2000, Exchange Server 2000 and Outlook 2000, the e-mail and calendar client included with Office 2000.   For users running that software, Microsoft charges $4,000 per product for DST fixes."
2007-03-04T17:50:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	They're providing a registry fix for Windows 2000.  I know, I'm installing it on a number of servers tomorrow morning.
2007-03-04T17:51:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	I can provide you with plenty of URLs on microsoft.com, if you'd like to continuing spreading FUD.
2007-03-04T17:51:00.000Z	dougb	jlgaddis	well that is good to know.
2007-03-04T17:51:00.000Z	dougb		haha no jlgaddis, I just think the price tag of the fix is ridiculous
2007-03-04T17:52:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	If that's even true that they're charging it for stuff older than Win2K, I don't blame them.
2007-03-04T17:52:00.000Z	jlgaddis	dougb	There's a reason why the products are EOL'd.  They're friggin' old and you shouldn't be running them.
