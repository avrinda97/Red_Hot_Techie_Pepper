2010-05-26T02:50:00.000Z	Docteh	|corpse|	theres ways around it, booting usb isn't always simple to work
2010-05-26T02:50:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	i have noticed. i have litterly spend days trying to get this going
2010-05-26T02:50:00.000Z	Docteh		eww
2010-05-26T02:51:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	not matter what i try i cant get linux installed on this box
2010-05-26T02:51:00.000Z	Docteh	|corpse|	do you have an existing linux box to play with things on?
2010-05-26T02:52:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	i have a desktop and pc with ubuntu desktop.
2010-05-26T02:52:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	err desktop and laptop
2010-05-26T02:52:00.000Z	Docteh		cool
2010-05-26T02:52:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 i have tried server 10.04 9.10 desktop 10.04  non will get though an install
2010-05-26T02:53:00.000Z	Docteh		oh but you can get them booted?
2010-05-26T02:53:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 i did at one point have server 10.04 on and working but i used a bad command and screwed it up, so i just thought i would reinstall. but thats not happening
2010-05-26T02:53:00.000Z	Docteh		have you tried a network install?
2010-05-26T02:53:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 no i havnt
2010-05-26T02:55:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 yeah the OS loads. right after you do the keyboard selection it runs a quick progress bar that says detecting pc devices then it just sits at a blue screen. then when i restart i get a menu that only alows me to do cd-rom detection options
2010-05-26T02:55:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 and with 10.04 desktop after i hit install it goes to the ubuntu splash screen and never goes any further
2010-05-26T02:56:00.000Z	Docteh		the cdrom detection options is odd, never seen that personally
2010-05-26T02:58:00.000Z	Docteh	|corpse|	is this a laptop thats giving you trouble?
2010-05-26T02:59:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 no its a tower
2010-05-26T03:00:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	 im just trying to set up a file server, mabey a proxy on it. so it had 6 hdd 1gig ram 2.8ghz amd
2010-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	Docteh	|corpse|	installing server should JustWork(tm) :-/
2010-05-26T03:02:00.000Z	|corpse|	Docteh	yep. right now i am actualy stuck on that progress bar. it says Detecting hardware to find CD-ROM drives. 0%
