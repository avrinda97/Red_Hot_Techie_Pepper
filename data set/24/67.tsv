2012-09-07T22:23:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	lsusb gives pastebin.com/STFmbR7B
2012-09-07T22:29:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	ok, please do this next: lspci -knn | grep -iA3 Wireless | pastebinit
2012-09-07T22:31:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	s/Wireless/Wifi? the former doesn't give me anything
2012-09-07T22:33:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	and Wifi would give results? then do that, please
2012-09-07T22:34:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	this should work, too: lspci -knnv | grep -iA7 network | pastebinit

2012-09-07T22:38:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	and you're using which ubuntu version?
2012-09-07T22:39:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	12.04
2012-09-07T22:44:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	does this give something? lsmod | grep rtl
2012-09-07T22:45:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	yup. what were you looking for in particular?
2012-09-07T22:46:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	the left column hs rtl8..., rtl8..._common, rtlwifi, mac20122, cfg80211
2012-09-07T22:46:00.000Z	alecb_		*mac80211
2012-09-07T22:46:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	i'm trying to find out which driver is in use. the rtl8... ones are of interest

2012-09-07T22:48:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	that's enough, thanks. give me a minute.
2012-09-07T22:52:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	dpkg -l linux-firmware | grep ^.i
2012-09-07T22:53:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	ii linux-firmware 1.79 \n Firmware for linux kernel drivers
2012-09-07T22:56:00.000Z	tomreyn	alecb_	so you have the firmware blobs installed already but they don't help, or not enough. it looks like your very model is not well supported. let's see if i can find a newer version of the driver and firmware.
2012-09-07T22:56:00.000Z	alecb_	tomreyn	I've actually got to run now (class) -- I'll try and get on later though and bother you again (or someone else if you're not around)
