2011-11-25T22:13:00.000Z	luca_bi		I need CSV files
2011-11-25T22:14:00.000Z	luca_bi		you cannot copy a pdf file
2011-11-25T22:14:00.000Z	luca_bi		how can you copy it?
2011-11-25T22:14:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	pdftotext -> file, some awk -> .csv
2011-11-25T22:17:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	get an OCR soft to make text of your pdf
2011-11-25T22:22:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	cuneiform, tessaract
2011-11-25T22:24:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	linuc ocr-soft
2011-11-28T22:29:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	don't chown mysql-dir, it'll break mysql
2011-11-28T22:32:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	if you really need to list contents of that dir, use "sudo ls -l /var/lib/mysql"
2011-11-28T23:24:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	first command exports your db"agenda" into a file, 2nd command restores it from a file into a db
2011-11-28T23:29:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	thanks very much another question
2011-11-28T23:31:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	don't use the "bin/" or use the correct path.
2011-11-28T23:32:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	Yes if I don't use bin/ it works
2011-11-28T23:32:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	those commands are in /usr/bin/   so bin/mysql only would work if you are in /usr
2011-11-28T23:33:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	you want to read some basics about pathes and how to call binaries etc.
2011-11-28T23:36:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	Ok I know folder /usr/bin but if I don't put bin/ the comand works
2011-11-28T23:36:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	you want to read some basics about pathes and how to call binaries etc.   don't use prefix bin/   to call those commands!
2011-11-28T23:36:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	In bin I have a lot of files executable
2011-11-28T23:37:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	check "echo $PATH"  you don't need to give pathes to binaries in all these listed directories
2011-11-28T23:37:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	Yes I want to read something more about pathes
2011-11-28T23:38:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
2011-11-28T23:42:00.000Z	luca_bi	llutz	If you have a file in these directories you don't need to write path?
2011-11-28T23:43:00.000Z	llutz	luca_bi	correct
