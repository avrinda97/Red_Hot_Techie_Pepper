2009-08-24T07:32:00.000Z	di||itante		Ok, I left for vacation and left my laptop running at home (on purpose), but I forgot to lock the gnome session. Anyone know how to do that from the cmd line for that session?
2009-08-24T07:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	you could stop the x server by /etc/init.rd gdm stop
2009-08-24T07:33:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	dont want to stop it
2009-08-24T07:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	just an off-the-cuff idea.
2009-08-24T07:35:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	thanks, I just need to leave Gnome running buut lock it down
2009-08-24T07:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	Well, a round about way would be to install VNC, then log in remotely and lock it... if no better ideas come along.
2009-08-24T07:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	:-)
2009-08-24T07:36:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	thanks

2009-08-24T07:45:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	thats it, now i just need to know how to do it remotely for the user that is runnong gnome
2009-08-24T07:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	the su command allows you to switch user.
2009-08-24T07:46:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	you'd have to know the password though.
2009-08-24T07:46:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	true but it wont put me in that login session
2009-08-24T07:48:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	ie. on the remote machine is running gnome as mike, im ssh'd in as mike, but that ssh sesssion is a divverent login on a different tty
2009-08-24T07:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	something in the back of my mind is saying there is a way to join a session in progress.  I may be thinking of a hardware terminal server, though.
2009-08-24T07:51:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	thanks a ton, ill keep researching
2009-08-24T07:51:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	If google hits anything, I'll let you know.
2009-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	Will that prevent mounting if he double-clicks on the partition?
2009-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	no
2009-12-22T11:23:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	can skitzo disable the ntfs module somehow?
2009-12-22T11:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	di||itante	Could he escape the space, eg: /media/Windows\ 7 ?
2009-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	di||itante	dsnyders	I seem to remember that not working in fstab
