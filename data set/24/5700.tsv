2006-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	whyameye		how do you change bootup parameters when booting from LILO?
2006-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	you cant iirc
2006-12-13T09:01:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	so if I changed something in my xorg.conf file and Gnome crashes now then how am I supposed to fix?
2006-12-13T09:02:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	in console
2006-12-13T09:04:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	how can I get to the console? the machine crashes hard.  No keys work after the crash at all.
2006-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	what do you mean jyuo cant get to console ?
2006-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	X fails then it drops you to console
2006-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	when Gnome tries to load the machine becomes completely unresponsive. COMPLETELY. It does NOT drop me to the console.
2006-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	s o gdm is failing?
2006-12-13T09:05:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	you boot right into X?
2006-12-13T09:06:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	trying to get dual head to work. I tried two different drivers one for each head. I guess it was a stupid thing to try
2006-12-13T09:06:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	not at all i love my tripes :)
2006-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	don't most installs boot right into x?
2006-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	boot into a liveCD mount your HDD and  edit xorg.conf
2006-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	and next time  use Xnest..  it loads X inside your currently running X
2006-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	that way you can test
2006-12-13T09:09:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	okay that is a good tip. Thank you.
2006-12-13T09:10:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	the cmd to runj it then is like so -->  startx -- /usr/bin/Xnest :#   <-- where the # is  a real number like  :2  :4
2006-12-13T09:11:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	you get that cmd ?
2006-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	okay I just saw the cmd. So I type /usr/bin/Xnest inside a console inside a Gnome session?
2006-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	yes just like i did you need the :#
2006-12-13T09:19:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	make that a real number :3 :1
2006-12-13T09:21:00.000Z	whyameye	richiefrich	ok. Well I'm finally back to where I started i.e. it will load up and the 2nd screen is blank. So I'll try now...
2006-12-13T09:21:00.000Z	richiefrich	whyameye	ok :)
