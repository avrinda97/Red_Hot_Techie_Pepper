2012-04-20T22:45:00.000Z	ldiamond		In Oneric, how do I add stuff to the panel in Unity (like CPU usage applet, Memory usage applet, etc)?
2012-04-20T22:46:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	lm-sensors and sensores-applet
2012-04-20T22:47:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	How do I add the sensor applet in Unity? I know how to do it with gnome panel, but unity is so not user-friendly
2012-04-20T22:48:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	secon, I'll try , not using unity either, might take a coup of tea
2012-04-20T22:49:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	even in 12.04 w/ gnome-panel, I couldn't figure out how to add it...
2012-04-20T22:50:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	right-click on panel, add.. but must have run sensors-detect beorehand and added modules, just some minutes, vm booting up
2012-04-20T22:51:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	or simply try what happens if you in gnome and then switch surface to unity
2012-04-20T22:52:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	can't right click on the panels in Unity, doesn't do anything for me
2012-04-20T22:52:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	log into gnome, I can sow you there, may that integrates in unity, too
2012-04-20T22:53:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	what do you mean?
2012-04-20T22:54:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	switch to classic gnome, install there and see if it occurs in unity, too then
2012-04-20T22:54:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	I'll give it a shot
2012-04-20T22:54:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	however that would be the most awful user interface....\
2012-04-20T22:55:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	I like ubuntu and gdm in debian for me, too
2012-04-20T22:55:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	lubuntu even
2012-04-20T22:56:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	my current install is from xubuntu, I didn't like so installed gnome.
2012-04-20T22:56:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	same way for xubu as in gnome
2012-04-20T22:59:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	if I add in gnome classic it doesn't display in Unity.
2012-04-20T22:59:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	the Unity panel is 100% useless.
2012-04-20T22:59:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	I'm overasked then, but others might know, I ask the goo-fu
2012-04-20T23:00:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	does apt-cache search indicator-sensors gives an output ?
2012-04-20T23:01:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	nop
2012-04-20T23:02:00.000Z	ldiamond	DasEi	I guess I'll wait for 12.04 to be released and try to get it working then.
2012-04-20T23:02:00.000Z	DasEi	ldiamond	there is something around Hardware Sensors Indicator, ask again for one of the unity fans
