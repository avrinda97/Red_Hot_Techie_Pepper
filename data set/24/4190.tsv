2010-08-29T00:40:00.000Z	rkvirani		should I delete /var/lib/dpkg/status?
2010-08-29T00:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	what are you running?  what command?  could you paste your sources.list?
2010-08-29T00:43:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	http://pastebin.ca/1927909
2010-08-29T00:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	you never mentioned what command you're running that causes the first error...
2010-08-29T00:47:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	apt-get update
2010-08-29T00:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	looks like a permissons thing.... does it persist after reboot?
2010-08-29T00:49:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	I deleted the package libntfs10
2010-08-29T00:50:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	gah it will update but I cant install anything
2010-08-29T00:50:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	now why would you go and do a thing like that?  haha!  i think apt-get install -f command or something that repairs...
2010-08-29T00:51:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	there was corruption in the status file
2010-08-29T00:52:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	just reinstalling ntfsprogs now to get the entry back
2010-08-29T00:53:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	you seem to have all sorts of weird issues... don't be mucking in things you don't understand!  i've broken the hell out of my system before because of newbie permission adjustments (it was several years ago :P)
2010-08-29T00:55:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rkvirani	isn't there a deb for that?
2010-08-29T00:55:00.000Z	rkvirani	arrrghhh	.dev yeah but the apt is telling me there is a more updated version in my repos
