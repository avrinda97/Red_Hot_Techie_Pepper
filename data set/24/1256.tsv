2010-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	dean[w]		My colleague somehow keeps breaking his way into my computer and elevating his permissions to admin via his user account. How could he be doing this?
2010-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	dean[w]		in /etc/sudoers?
2010-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	do you create him/her in the admin group?
2010-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	dean[w]	ActionParsnip	nope. I went to administration > users & groups
2010-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	strange, do you have a root password set?
2010-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	dean[w]	ActionParsnip	im not sure...
2010-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	or do you only use your user account (this is default)
2010-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	if you arent sure then you havent set it which is good
2010-12-17T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	i suggest you run this just to be sure:   sudo usermod -p '!' root     disables the account
2010-12-17T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	cool
2010-12-17T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	if you run:   groups foo     (replace foo with the username you gave him), is it in the admin group?
2010-12-17T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	does he know your ubuntu password?
2010-12-17T13:46:00.000Z	dean[w]	ActionParsnip	sami : sami adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape dip video plugdev fuse git
2010-12-17T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	looks fine, does he know your ubuntu password?
2010-12-17T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	cos that would do it ;)
2010-12-17T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	possibly he's been packet sniffing
2010-12-17T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	i guess but if you connect to his system then he has the key for that session, it could be done in theory
2010-12-17T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	thats what i thought
2010-12-17T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	install and run rkhunter
2010-12-17T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	it'll need running with sudo
2010-12-17T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	i'd just ask, go the low tech way
2010-12-17T13:56:00.000Z	dean[w]	ActionParsnip	ive of coursed ask
2010-12-17T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dean[w]	i'd disable the account, see if he's actually using his own account
2010-12-17T14:00:00.000Z	dean[w]	ActionParsnip	i have done that for now :)
