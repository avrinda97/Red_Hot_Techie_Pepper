2008-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1		this sucks I keep getting kicked off
2008-02-25T01:33:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Change your IRC program, see if it still happens...
2008-02-25T01:33:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	it happens in irssi too
2008-02-25T01:34:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Was it you that asked about pidgin?  Mine hasn't been giving me any problems at all. (gutsy)
2008-02-25T01:34:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Sounds like a connection / ISP issue.
2008-02-25T01:34:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	yeah I'm pretty sure it is, I'm on a wireless router right now
2008-02-25T01:35:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	gets half the speed of the old wired connection
2008-02-25T01:36:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	To be honest, I'd get another drive... They're pretty cheap, and can save some heart-ache later one.
2008-02-25T01:36:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	another drive before dual booting?
2008-02-25T01:37:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Dual booting itself, or installing for dual boot?
2008-02-25T01:38:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	er... I'm asking if you're suggesting I get another hard drive to install ubuntu on, or just for all my files and stuff
2008-02-25T01:39:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Oh.  To install Ubuntu on.  If it's an 80G drive, and you've got 40 gigs of 'data', then you're pretty close to it being used up already, right?
2008-02-25T01:39:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	I transferred all my data to my other computer and backed it all up on DVD-R's.
2008-02-25T01:40:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	I'm networked to the other computer from my laptop, I was thinking I can stream music to it or something, and get another hard drive later to keep all that stuff on
2008-02-25T01:40:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Oh.  Well, I like to leave a lot of room for Linux because I get into all kinds of applications.  My partition is 60G for root.
2008-02-25T01:41:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	yeah there would be a good amount of apps on that computer too... that's why I wanted to make it 60/20 or something.
2008-02-25T01:41:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	but if I did get another internal hard drive, is there a particular kind I should get for an OS? Or are they all basically the same and need only formatting?
2008-02-25T01:42:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	You should get the kind your MB supports.  (IE, IDE or SATA )
2008-02-25T01:43:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	right, ok. Maybe I should wait then. I'm doing this for my girlfriend/wife/fiance/whatevershis. I have gutsy on my laptop, she wants it on the desktop (which will mostly be hers) I was going to set it up now while she's out
2008-02-25T01:44:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Then I definitely wouldn't be repartitioning her Windows drive.
2008-02-25T01:45:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	yeah, it was our computer... still is sort of. There's nothing on the windows drive anymore except basic programs and photoshop
2008-02-25T01:45:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	Still, would it be a loss to lose everything on it?
2008-02-25T01:46:00.000Z	ahorriblemes1	storm-zen	only if Ubuntu seriously doesn't work out at all on that computer. I've read about freeze-ups and stuff on IBM A50's (that's what it is). I'll probably just wait to get a hard drive or something. Thanks for your help, I appreciate it
2008-02-25T01:47:00.000Z	storm-zen	ahorriblemes1	 Not a problem.  Sometimes the best thing to do is to give it some time and think about it before you do it.
