2005-01-29T11:05:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	you were asking about usb support? it's all good, both my mp3 players work fine with usb2, digital cam too, and so does my usb midi keyboard
2005-01-29T11:05:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	yeah i have this wireless usb adapter i want to mess with

2005-01-29T11:07:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	with an atmel chip

2005-01-29T11:09:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	atmel? that's good then, they're supported. you can find the atmel firmware and driver sources and tools from either the ubuntu repository or debian universe (can't remember more precisely=
2005-01-29T11:15:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	bleh, not my type of chicks :)
2005-01-29T11:15:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	too bad, more for me then
2005-01-29T11:16:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	do you use wireless under ubuntu ?
2005-01-29T11:17:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	yes, on my laptop
2005-01-29T11:18:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	well wireless works great here on my hp laptop running slackware with ndiswrapper .. but trying to get more info on ubuntu and wireless adapters
2005-01-29T11:18:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	yes, i'm using ndiswrapper too
2005-01-29T11:19:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	it's not perfect... but it's not really a distro-specific problem, but a profound problem with the perverted idea of using windows drivers on linux :)
2005-01-29T12:47:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	hey you still here ?
2005-01-29T12:52:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	yup?
2005-01-29T12:53:00.000Z	mz2	Destructo	no specific setup tool for usb stuff, not that i know of at least
2005-01-29T12:54:00.000Z	Destructo	mz2	to be honest ive never deal with usb .. what do i do ..?  the installation is going atm , so i waiting
