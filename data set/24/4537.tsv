2009-07-30T21:30:00.000Z	Whitor	sketchyd	of course
2009-07-30T21:30:00.000Z	sketchyd		use incognito mode for that
2009-07-30T21:30:00.000Z	sketchyd		theres a few plugins i think
2009-07-30T21:30:00.000Z	sketchyd		or maybe its on the beta
2009-07-30T21:31:00.000Z	Whitor		not only that... but internal sites in my network
2009-07-30T21:31:00.000Z	sketchyd		i missed the original question, whitor
2009-07-30T21:31:00.000Z	sketchyd		what were you looking for?
2009-07-30T21:31:00.000Z	Whitor		also facebook ... whatever... I don't want to switch modes to clear the location bar drop down list
2009-07-30T21:32:00.000Z	Whitor	sketchyd	trying to clear the location bar drop down list
2009-07-30T21:32:00.000Z	Whitor		clearing private data doesn't do it
2009-07-30T21:32:00.000Z	sketchyd		permanently?
2009-07-30T21:32:00.000Z	Whitor		yes, permanantly
2009-07-30T21:32:00.000Z	Whitor		Deleting .mozilla does do it
2009-07-30T21:33:00.000Z	sketchyd		whitor - firefox, tools, options, privacy, location bar at the bottom
2009-07-30T21:33:00.000Z	Whitor		so I know its in the ff profile somewhere
2009-07-30T21:33:00.000Z	sketchyd		switch it to nothing
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	sketchyd		whitor - did you find that?
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	Whitor	sketchyd	you mean Edit - Preferences ? There is no 'options' under tools ...
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	sketchyd		which ff are you on?
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	Whitor		3.0.12 on ubuntu
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	sketchyd		but yeah, that could be too
2009-07-30T21:34:00.000Z	sketchyd	im	on vista right now, so my menus may be slightly different
2009-07-30T21:35:00.000Z	Whitor	sketchyd	ahh ... yeah prolly a little different
