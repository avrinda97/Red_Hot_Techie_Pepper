2009-09-11T00:13:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	Hi, I've having problems when it comes to ''make'' a program I want to install
2009-09-11T00:14:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	what program?
2009-09-11T00:14:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	I'm trying to install Mutella and the ./configure seems to work fine so I then type sudo make but it splits out a bunch of errors like INT_MAX was not declared in this scopre, install-recursive...
2009-09-11T00:16:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	what you are trying to do isn't officially supported... you don't need to make mutella as it is already in the repositorys
2009-09-11T00:16:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	sudo apt-get install mutella
2009-09-11T00:17:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	it says it couldn't find the package...
2009-09-11T00:17:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	good learning book (free) www.ubuntupocketguide.com
2009-09-11T00:17:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	do sudo apt-get update
2009-09-11T00:18:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	still can't find it.  Can you?
2009-09-11T00:18:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	you will need to enable the universe repository from system>administration>software sources
2009-09-11T00:19:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	thank you!
2009-09-11T00:22:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	there it is same functionality ... you will still need to enable universe as i have said before
2009-09-11T00:23:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	it is enabled right now.  What do i do now?
2009-09-11T00:24:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	sudo apt-get install gtk-gnutella
2009-09-11T00:25:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	that is the mutella CLI that's intalling?
2009-09-11T00:25:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	no it is a GUI
2009-09-11T00:25:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	I wanted mutella because it had a CLI.  Is there any chance you can help me install mutella on my machine?
2009-09-11T00:27:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	what version of ubuntu?
2009-09-11T00:28:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	9.04
2009-09-11T00:29:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	if you want mutella and you want it to work I'd reccommend installing Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 as the package maintainer is only packaging mutella for the LTS releases
2009-09-11T00:29:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	so if I install 8.04 and I go into the package manager it will be there?  Or i could just also type sudo get-apt install mutella in terminal?
2009-09-11T00:30:00.000Z	fccf	mathix	assuming universe is enabled yes
2009-09-11T00:30:00.000Z	mathix	fccf	ok, downloading right now!
