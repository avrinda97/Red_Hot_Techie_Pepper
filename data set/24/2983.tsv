2008-09-10T14:36:00.000Z	g33k_gir1		thanks for the skype link. I've been followign those instructions, and I'm stuck on Audio Problems 1.3
2008-09-10T14:36:00.000Z	g33k_gir1		I can't get the mic to work
2008-09-10T14:37:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Excellent, now have you got the microphone working outside skype?
2008-09-10T14:37:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	no
2008-09-10T14:37:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Well if it won't work outside skype, it won't work inside skype either :)
2008-09-10T14:38:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Just for fun, right-click on the speaker icon in the men and choose Open Volume Control
2008-09-10T14:38:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	ok
2008-09-10T14:39:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Do you see a window with lots of sliders?
2008-09-10T14:39:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Can you see a slider for microphone?
2008-09-10T14:39:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	all the sliders are at max. nothing is checked in the mute boxes, including the slider for front mic and mic
2008-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Tick the mute for microphone, then untick it.
2008-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	ok...
2008-09-10T14:40:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Are there any tabs on the window?
2008-09-10T14:41:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	no...
2008-09-10T14:41:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	no change when trying to record a test sound file (using krec)
2008-09-10T14:41:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	So all you have is one tab called "Playback" ?
2008-09-10T14:41:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	no, the tab is just called HDA intel
2008-09-10T14:42:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Lemmie guess, you're not running Ubuntu?
2008-09-10T14:42:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	^^
2008-09-10T14:42:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	does that make a difference if I'm using gnome vs kde?
2008-09-10T14:42:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	Yeah, I figured that when you said you were using krec :)
2008-09-10T14:43:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	No, but me telling you where to click and what it looks like won't help :)
2008-09-10T14:43:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	owh	lol, so should I jump into #kubuntu and ask there instead?
2008-09-10T14:43:00.000Z	owh	g33k_gir1	I think you just got an offer from lmg :)
