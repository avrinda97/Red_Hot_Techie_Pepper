2007-07-03T08:49:00.000Z	rich1		is there a channel for ubuntu wireless?
2007-07-03T08:50:00.000Z	rich1		thanks.  i have to replace my hd and can't remember if bcm 4318 drivers were included in feisty kernel.
2007-07-03T08:51:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	they are, but the firmware isnt. for that, "sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter"
2007-07-03T08:51:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	and will that get me full speed on wireless?  ie:  not limited to 11mps?
2007-07-03T08:52:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	it should
2007-07-03T08:52:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	still now wpa on broadcoms though
2007-07-03T08:52:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	at least with network manager. i havent checked with wifi-radar or wicd + wpa_suppicant
2007-07-03T08:52:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	cool.  no need for wpa.  i'm only using wep.
2007-07-03T08:53:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	i've read about problems with net-man on forums.  any thoughts on wicd?
2007-07-03T08:54:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	ive never used it.  NM and WPA works on any drivers that use WEXT.  the ones that dont require something else and wpa_supplicant.  non-wpa will always work on NM though, AFAIK
2007-07-03T08:55:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	ok.  what about connecting to open networks?  are there still probs there in feisty?
2007-07-03T08:55:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	no. unencrypted and wep  should always work
2007-07-03T08:55:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	 the problems are just with wpa
2007-07-03T08:55:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	i have that card in this computer and until the neighbors' wireless got password-protected, i could connect
2007-07-03T08:57:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	 cool.  wish me luck with the new hd.  thxxxx for the help.
2008-02-13T13:42:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	i am
2008-02-13T13:42:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	whats up?
2008-02-13T13:43:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	cool.  i was having trouble with firefox and applets.  i made xul.mfasl executable and now they work.  is that ok?
2008-02-13T13:43:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	no idea
2008-02-13T13:43:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	whats that have to do with forum modship?
2008-02-13T13:44:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	i guess i'm asking too late cause i posted the fix on the forums.
2008-02-13T13:44:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	i don't know.  i guess i just thought you guys knew everything.
2008-02-13T13:44:00.000Z	macogw	rich1	nah we just turn into mods if we're considered helpful and friendly and stuff and are there for a while
2008-02-13T13:45:00.000Z	rich1	macogw	ok.  i just hope i didn't post bad advice.
