2007-10-02T15:20:00.000Z	leladia		pls i am trying to exclude two separate strings from my grep -v command line how do i do it?
2007-10-02T15:20:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	or run grep twice :)
2007-10-02T15:21:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	grep -v blabla /var/log/messages | grep -v bloblo
2007-10-02T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	then read the manpage for grep if you don't want to take suggestions
2007-10-02T15:22:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	isn't there some other way?
2007-10-02T15:36:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	grep -v 'sleep\|wake' bla.log
2007-10-02T15:37:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	let me also try that and see
2007-10-02T15:42:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	grep -v 'sleep\|wake' bla.log (i tried it but it is not also filtering out wake. it filters sleep)
2007-10-31T23:28:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	what are you trying to achieve? The command you gave filters everything but capital letters
2007-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	that is what i am trying to achieve but it is not working when i run it
2007-10-31T23:29:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	what is the result you get?
2007-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	file2 is empty
2007-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	nothing gets filtered to file2
2007-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	does file1
2007-10-31T23:30:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	does file1 contain uppercase letters? :)
2007-10-31T23:31:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	yes lots
2007-10-31T23:31:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	odd
2007-10-31T23:31:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	yes
2007-10-31T23:32:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	is it possible for you to try it and see?  thanks
2007-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	that's normal
2007-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	'home1' has no capitals
2007-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	Seveas	leladia	instead of echo you might want cat to cat the file ;)
2007-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	am sorry i forgot i was using echo
2007-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	leladia	Seveas	yes you are right cat is the right one
