2008-12-02T21:34:00.000Z	fasta	rww	the whole point was that Debian wanted to improve some stuff.
2008-12-02T21:34:00.000Z	fasta	rww	then the Mozilla guys said: fine, but you need to rebrand it.
2008-12-02T21:35:00.000Z	fasta	rww	so, why doesn't Ubuntu have the same improvements?
2008-12-02T21:35:00.000Z	rww	fasta	If you look back at the discussion when it happened, it wasn't about improving anything. That came later.
2008-12-02T21:35:00.000Z	fasta	rww	I read the discussion when it happened.
2008-12-02T21:36:00.000Z	rww	fasta	Firstly, Mozilla got mad at Debian for unapproved packaging. Debian then turned around and decided that the branding policy was non-dfsg free. Then, we ended up with Iceweasel. Any customization or improvement of Iceweasel over Firefox came later.
2008-12-02T21:36:00.000Z	fasta	rww	The Mozilla guys were afraid of getting a bad name in theory and legally that they were afraid of losing the brand.
2008-12-02T21:36:00.000Z	fasta	rww	anyone could call something Firefox.
2008-12-02T21:36:00.000Z	fasta	rww	they wanted to avoid that.
2008-12-02T21:37:00.000Z	fasta	rww	ok, but my actual problem is an encoding problem.
2008-12-02T21:37:00.000Z	rww	fasta	View -> Character Encoding -> Unicode
2008-12-02T21:38:00.000Z	rww	fasta	sorry, didn't see your original problem until I scrolled up and checked for it just now
2008-12-02T21:42:00.000Z	fasta	rww	which encoding are you using to correctly view that webpage?
2008-12-02T21:42:00.000Z	fasta	rww	I tried a few different combinations, but they all won't work.
2008-12-02T21:42:00.000Z	fasta	rww	it could also be a bug in the website.
2008-12-02T21:43:00.000Z	fasta	rww	ok, I got it working somehow.
2008-12-02T21:43:00.000Z	rww	fasta	View -> Character Encoding -> Unicode worked fine for me
2008-12-02T21:45:00.000Z	rww	fasta	not sure why Firefox doesn't autodetect it as Unicode, since there's a UTF-8 content-type meta tag, but whatever, that's how to fix it.
2008-12-02T21:46:00.000Z	fasta	rww	Konqueror has the same problem.
2008-12-02T21:46:00.000Z	fasta	rww	I am not sure how I can configure Konqueror such that it remembers it across restarts.
2008-12-02T21:52:00.000Z	rww	fasta	since konqueror is a kubuntu package, maybe try asking #kubuntu?
2009-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	rww	fasta	If you're talking about compiz, System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects > None
2009-01-05T14:20:00.000Z	fasta	rww	thank you
