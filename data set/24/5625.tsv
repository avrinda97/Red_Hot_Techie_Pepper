2009-02-08T16:12:00.000Z	Bram		does anybody know if there is a windows command so I can boot from a cd? (I want to install ubuntu over broken windows xp)
2009-02-08T16:13:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	so your box won't let you boot from CD ?
2009-02-08T16:14:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	no, I can start windows in safe mode and I need a command so I can boot from cd
2009-02-08T16:14:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	that has nothing to do with windows or ubuntu... that'S a bios thing
2009-02-08T16:15:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	well my windows is totally broken (some virusses)
2009-02-08T16:19:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto have you done the burning right?
2009-02-08T16:19:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	well one is done by myself and the other one by someone else.
2009-02-08T16:20:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	and you did not burn the *file* to CD, but made an image copy of the .iso, right?
2009-02-08T16:21:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	yes I did "burn cd as image"
2009-02-08T16:22:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	so you have to tell your BIOS to boot from CD... if it's too old try the smart boot manager or a boot floppy
2009-02-08T16:24:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	well I actually can't do much since the computer I want to install it on is full of the worst virusses, so I just want to get in the cd
2009-02-08T16:24:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	that's totally irrelevant
2009-02-08T16:25:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	you know how to get the BIOS when you start the computer, don't you?
2009-02-08T16:26:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	when I enter setup (with F2) it asks me if I want to use safe mode or start windows the normal way, but I don't know another way to get in the BIOS
2009-02-08T16:27:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	that's not the BIOS, that's already the windows bootloader... prolly you have to press 'del' or 'esc'
2009-02-08T16:28:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	thank you, I'll try those I'll tell if it worked
2009-02-08T16:34:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	I can't seem to get in the BIOS it will always go to the screen I told
2009-02-08T16:35:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	what make and model is that computer?
2009-02-08T16:36:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	it's an old dell on the side it says inspiron 7500
2009-02-08T16:37:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	try 'F8' for Dell
2009-02-08T16:38:00.000Z	stefg	Bram	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/psyd/setup.htm
2009-02-08T16:42:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	F8 does the same
2009-02-08T16:43:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	well I have to go now, I'll fix it later   bye
2009-02-08T16:43:00.000Z	Bram	stefg	F2 does the same
