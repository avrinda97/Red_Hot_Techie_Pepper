2007-12-13T07:26:00.000Z	marc		hey guys im having trouble with my screen i keep getting "OUT OF RANGE" error after I installed, and when I goto recovery mode I dont get a command line all I see is "==============" after various things load ;/
2007-12-13T07:26:00.000Z	marc		i cant use commands because i cant get to a terminal
2007-12-13T07:27:00.000Z	marc		im not talking about the computer im on, i installed Ubuntu on another computer, and it wont load the desktop
2007-12-13T07:28:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	well when you boot in Recovery Mode what happens?
2007-12-13T07:29:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	fsck?
2007-12-13T07:29:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	any messages?
2007-12-13T07:30:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	well any messages?
2007-12-13T07:30:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	ok, but you get no prompt?
2007-12-13T07:31:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	ok what happens before the string you showed me?
2007-12-13T07:32:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	try switching to tty2 via Ctrl-Alt-F2?
2007-12-13T07:32:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	yes
2007-12-13T07:35:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	you have to wait a bit
2007-12-13T07:35:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	until Ubuntu finishes loading, since getty for tty1-9 hasn't started
2007-12-13T07:35:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	eventually you should get a login prompt
2007-12-13T07:37:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	just "======..."?
2007-12-13T07:39:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	whats the line right before it?
2007-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	looks like...a kernel panic?
2007-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	when the kernel encounters an unrecoverable exception and dumps stack
2007-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	run memtest86+
2007-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	you might have bad memory
2007-12-13T07:43:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	I had issues like this on a machine, that's what the cause was
2007-12-13T07:43:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	there should be memtest on the Ubuntu CD
2007-12-13T07:47:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	let it run for a while
2007-12-13T07:49:00.000Z	scguy318	marc	if it finds any errors, then memory is most definitely the culprit
