2008-06-16T01:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	if it's so stupid, don't install it
2008-06-16T02:00:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	Well i don't have windows anymore so its obviously too late and the theme on my pc right now looks horrible reminds of windows 98 or something
2008-06-16T02:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	hm
2008-06-16T02:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	which theme are you using
2008-06-16T02:01:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	Well i tried plenty threw out the day. From vista themes to mac themes, but the one i wanted to install was the mac
2008-06-16T02:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	there is a theme that's designed specifically to look like Win98
2008-06-16T02:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	you haven't left that on, have you?
2008-06-16T02:02:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	well i have the same theme that the system starts off with when you first start it up
2008-06-16T02:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	unless my memory is seriously faulty, that doesn't look much like Windows 98
2008-06-16T02:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	admittedly the last version of Windows I really looked at much was Win95 so I could be wrong
2008-06-16T02:04:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	Well either way i just want any working theme that i could use on ubuntu just so i could switch this one out
2008-06-16T02:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	System->Appearance->Theme
2008-06-16T02:05:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	there is no appearance or theme.....
2008-06-16T02:06:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	never mind i found the appearance
2008-06-16T02:07:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	I don't really like the themes that are pre-installed i want a mac bar like the one you said you had
2008-06-16T02:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	I didn't say I had a Mac bar
2008-06-16T02:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	I'd actually pay quite a lot of money to have a desktop that looked nothing like a Mac
2008-06-16T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	I have to use Macs at work, and I have to say they're the most singularly ugly, cluttered, badly-thought-out GUI I've ever used
2008-06-16T03:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	probably lots of people
2008-06-16T03:21:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	i was wondering were you went earlyer
2008-06-16T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	working, and now off to bed ;-)
2008-06-16T03:21:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	Awww :( I still didn't fix my problem :(
2008-06-16T03:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	gus_	all these netsplits are making me seasick
2008-06-16T03:22:00.000Z	gus_	gordonjcp	All these ubuntu processes are making me seasick :(
