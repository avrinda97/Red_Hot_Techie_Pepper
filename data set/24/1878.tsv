2009-08-20T10:53:00.000Z	quantolf		how do i extract a .bin file?
2009-08-20T10:54:00.000Z	Karhuton	quantolf	.bin files are of not any standard format - type 'file nameoffile.bin' to console and check if it tells you what type of file it is
2009-08-20T10:54:00.000Z	quantolf	Karhuton	POSIX shell script text executable
2009-08-20T10:54:00.000Z	Karhuton	quantolf	so it's not a binary file, it's a text file
2009-08-20T10:54:00.000Z	Karhuton		it's a nvidia driver package?
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	quantolf	Karhuton	3ware 3dm2
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	Karhuton		you just execute it
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	quantolf		how through cli?
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	Karhuton		./thefile.bin
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	Karhuton		chmod +x thefile.bin if it's not executable yet
2009-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	quantolf	Karhuton	 i get this error:           'bc' command was not found. Please make sure bc is in the path and run the installer again.
2009-08-20T10:56:00.000Z	quantolf	Karhuton	i've installed it before through a gui and a java gui popped up and i used that to install
2009-08-20T10:56:00.000Z	quantolf	Karhuton	i'm trying now thorugh cli only
2009-08-20T10:57:00.000Z	Karhuton	quantolf	try: ./thefile.bin --help or -h
2009-08-20T10:57:00.000Z	Karhuton		maybe it gives some parameters you can try to get it running
2009-08-20T10:57:00.000Z	Karhuton		and try: 'which bc' to check that you actually have it already
2009-08-20T10:57:00.000Z	quantolf		same error
2009-08-20T10:58:00.000Z	quantolf		oh shit fuck did i forget to do that
