2010-06-07T00:32:00.000Z	jhattara		my gdm got completely stuck, is there any way to restart the gdm, without restarting the whole computer again?
2010-06-07T00:33:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Generally:  sudo service gdm restart
2010-06-07T00:33:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Just be advised to save whatever it is you're working on currently.
2010-06-07T00:35:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	let's see if that works, i already tried /etc/init.d/gdm restart, and nothing happened on the computer
2010-06-07T00:35:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Hmm...strange it didn't do anything from *that* directory.  Did you sudo?
2010-06-07T00:36:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	i'm currently using it remotely, but the actual computer showed no changes from earlier restart
2010-06-07T00:36:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	yeah, of course i used sudo
2010-06-07T00:36:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Well, I'm not famliar with remote practices.   It could be a permissions issue.  This your box?
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	yeah, my local home box, currently 5 meters away from my laptop
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	Firefishe		heh
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	Firefishe		I see
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Well, you could just log out, restart the x server from the gui login page, then log back in.
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	jhattara		i can connect to it via SSH, but nothing happens on the screen and the keyboard lights don't react to anything
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Sounds like the remote proggie is acting up.
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Or ssh is not behaving
2010-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	absolutely nothing happens on the local machine
2010-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Well, then log in to it directly.  Although, I surmise that operating *remotely* is part of your *desired* practice at this moment?
2010-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	i'm currently logged in to my computer with SSH, but on the monitor and keyboard physically connected to it, nothing happens
2010-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 That's weird....module loading problem?
2010-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	jhattara	Firefishe	i can't login directly, because nothing happens on the screen, gdm got stuck, using keyboard does absolutely nothing
2010-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	jhattara		but the computer is still operating on OS level, as i can connect to it remotely
2010-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Well, as a test, I'd reboot it, making sure that *nothing* else is connected to it.  I'd even disconnect it from the 'net if it is, just to see if the monitor and keyboard can be detected as-is.
2010-06-07T00:40:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Also, disconnect and reconnect the keyboard and monitor.  Sometimes jacks get dusty.
2010-06-07T00:41:00.000Z	Firefishe	jhattara	 Blow into the jacks to dislodge dust, if any.  Use pure air in a can if you have it.
