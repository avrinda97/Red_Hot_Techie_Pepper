2006-11-08T13:36:00.000Z	berkes__		is there anything special about usermanagement in MySQL for ubuntu?
2006-11-08T13:37:00.000Z	berkes__		I cannot get normal access set with the GRANT queries.
2006-11-08T13:37:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	i've not noticed anything different from other distributions
2006-11-08T13:39:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	what does your grant statement look like (don't paste here)
2006-11-08T13:41:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	http://pastie.caboo.se/21803 pasted it theree
2006-11-08T13:42:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	that looks ok. what error do you get?
2006-11-08T13:43:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	I think I am being a stpd fckhead, forgot to flush privileges.
2006-11-08T13:44:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	hehe. try phpmyadmin ;)
2006-11-08T13:45:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	hmm, no, flushing did not help either.
2006-11-08T13:45:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	have you tried connecting manually and supplying a password?
2006-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	yea, that is when I get that error.
2006-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	is this a new mysql installation?
2006-11-08T13:47:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	yup. I used to have an old Debian, but since edgy i went for vanilla Ubuntu.
2006-11-08T13:48:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	i meant are the databases fresh or did they come from a previous system?
2006-11-08T13:48:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	no, still only empty.
2006-11-08T13:49:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	I had tonight reserved to write some import routines to import that old system :) But I cannot even get the permissions set ;)
2006-11-08T13:50:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	you might try changing the password with an update query using the PASSWORD() function
2006-11-08T13:50:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	or use mysqladmin
2006-11-08T13:51:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	i've only seen this problem when i've forgotten to supply a password or given a incorrect one when connecting
2006-11-08T13:51:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	yea, was apt-ing that already. Its just so weird that something this simple wont Just Work
2006-11-08T13:52:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	can you connect to the test database? just to check things overall
2006-11-08T13:52:00.000Z	berkes__	neil__	yes, as root it works Just Fine.
2006-11-08T13:53:00.000Z	neil__	berkes__	it would. root can go anywhere
