2008-12-26T23:44:00.000Z	hrehf		hmmm, i installed the cup ubuntu package, which is a program that should also install some java libs - the program runs fine, but when i try to compile the example code it generates, my java compiler complains about the libraries missing.. what do i do now? how do i find out if the libs got indeed installed?
2008-12-26T23:45:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	what did the log say?
2008-12-26T23:46:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	what log?
2008-12-26T23:46:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	what did the log say was missing?
2008-12-26T23:46:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	the error exactly,
2008-12-26T23:46:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	typical java package missing error : parser.java:294: package java_cup.runtime does not exist
2008-12-26T23:48:00.000Z	pengwyn		there ya go.   I bet there were more errors rehf,
2008-12-26T23:48:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	and all the usual following errors. i'm wondering, shouldn't the package have installed those libraries into the system java?

2008-12-26T23:49:00.000Z	pengwyn		I bet there's a WORSE err0r
2008-12-26T23:50:00.000Z	pengwyn		search the worse eRRoR
2008-12-26T23:50:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	was that directed at me? did you ever compile java?
2008-12-26T23:51:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	CVS?
2008-12-26T23:52:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	what? :( there's actually other erros in the main class, but the package won't magically appear when i fix those
2008-12-26T23:53:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	I always try to grep the WORST err0r and then fix that.
2008-12-26T23:53:00.000Z	pengwyn		just the way I do shit
2008-12-26T23:54:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	so, do you have any idea regarding the package / libraries issue?
2008-12-26T23:54:00.000Z	pengwyn	hrehf	yeah there could be errors.
2008-12-26T23:55:00.000Z	pengwyn		one error bringing the whole thing down
2008-12-26T23:55:00.000Z	pengwyn		use intuition
2008-12-26T23:56:00.000Z	pengwyn		I gotta get outta this channel before they ban me for typing words.  (morals and religon be damned) words - look up Frank Zappa on Archive.org
2008-12-26T23:56:00.000Z	pengwyn		peace!  and relax your emergency isn't mine
2008-12-26T23:58:00.000Z	hrehf	pengwyn	lol. do you actually write what i say? did you EVER compile java? your comments only waste more of my time, it seems
