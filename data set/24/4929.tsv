2007-06-17T10:03:00.000Z	hendrixski		how can I set my DNS permanently?
2007-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	edit /etc/dchp3/something
2007-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	ill find it .. hold on
2007-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	sweet, thanks
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	here.. /etc/dchp3/dhclient.conf
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	edit this line prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	(put your dns servers in there)
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	thank you :-)  yeah.. I was gonna set it for openDNS  :-)  i'ts the best
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	i use opendns :D
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	unless you have a static ip.. then you just put it into /etc/resolv.conf
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	I now.. I recognized the address you gave me  I'm just tired of having to input it each time I turn the computer on
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	yeah
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	have fun with those :)
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	I don't seem to have an /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.congf :-(
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	.conf not .confg
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	hendrixski		oh wait... nevermind
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	hendrixski		lol
2007-06-17T10:08:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	remember that location.. its useful if you ever need to setup dns again
2007-06-17T10:09:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	"domain-name server" appears on several lines... any specific one?
2007-06-17T10:10:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	make one line.. then comment out the others
2007-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	hendrixski	madman91	got it.  thanks
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	but know that it would be better if you set your router up to use those dns servers
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	and let dhcp assign those dns servers to each computer
2007-06-17T10:14:00.000Z	madman91	hendrixski	but i understand you,... i did the same thing for a long time
