2009-07-03T23:46:00.000Z	kiefer		hi, I am having a HUGE problem with this computer. When I try to do a fresh install with a jaunty live CD,  I cannot boot from cd, I also cannot run the .exe once gutsy starts up.
2009-07-03T23:46:00.000Z	kiefer		I tried package manager update, but it is way out of date
2009-07-03T23:46:00.000Z	kiefer		needs to be redone
2009-07-03T23:47:00.000Z	kiefer		nickster04: how do I get the comp to install jaunty then?
2009-07-03T23:47:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	Did you verify the CD using the verification option on the boot menu?
2009-07-03T23:48:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	no how does one do that?
2009-07-03T23:48:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	Does the CD boot at all?
2009-07-03T23:48:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	What do you mean?
2009-07-03T23:49:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	I mean I have installed from live cds dozens of times, and each time on startup, it runs the disc...not the O
2009-07-03T23:49:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	but in this case I can only access it after GNOME loads
2009-07-03T23:50:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	access being, read the disk?
2009-07-03T23:50:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	yeah
2009-07-03T23:50:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	What do you see on the disk, out of curiosity?
2009-07-03T23:51:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	Casper, dists, install, isolinux, pics, pool, preseed, ubuntu, autoruninf, md5sum, README, wub1.exe
2009-07-03T23:52:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	Alright, that sounds normal.  But, if it doesn't boot, it must not be.  Which iso did you download?
2009-07-03T23:52:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	 Jaunty amd64 live cd
2009-07-03T23:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	the desktop CD?
2009-07-03T23:53:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	I think so
2009-07-03T23:55:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	And this is a 64bit computer?
2009-07-03T23:56:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	I was told it is by the person who owns the computer, I cannot get info from the comp about what sort of processor is in it. I looked at the motherboard, and it is intel
2009-07-03T23:56:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	but yeah, I think it is 64
2009-07-03T23:56:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	even if it was not, it would still load cd on boot. hould I try a 32 bit?
2009-07-03T23:57:00.000Z	Flannel	kiefer	I'd download the 32bit one, just to try it.  All 64bit machines will work with the 32bit one, yeah. i386 disk
2009-07-03T23:57:00.000Z	kiefer	Flannel	I already have it,  I will try again
