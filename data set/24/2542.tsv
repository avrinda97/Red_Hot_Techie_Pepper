2009-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	kjelle		Hi, can i somehow get a list of how much stack each process uses?
2009-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	kjelle		yes
2009-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	what are you talking about "stack"
2009-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	do you know what the stack is?
2009-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	what do you mean by stack ?
2009-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	well, how much stack memory a given process uses.
2009-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	ps aux
2009-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	no, it displays the combined usage of code, data and stack
2009-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	i need to only know the stack :)
2009-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	it depends in what sense
2009-12-11T20:03:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	memory
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	I'm not sure what you're referencing as a memeory "stack"
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	stack memory allocation
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	then you dont know what it is :)
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	ah ha http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation
2009-12-11T20:04:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	wikipedia doesnt make you an expert.
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	I didn't say it did make me an expert
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	im sorry.
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	you should be able to see that with truss, it will show you the allocations of each thread in the proces
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	truss? okey, lemme try
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	not %100 if it's what you are looking for, but I think it should give you the info you want
2009-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	okey, thanks
2009-12-11T20:07:00.000Z	kjelle	ikonia	seems truss is solaris, and strace/dtrace on ubuntu. if it is strace, my limited experience with that is that you can use it on one (1) process,and not the entire list.
2009-12-11T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	kjelle	yes, you'd have to attatch to each process, wouldn't be able to do it for everthing, (strace works on linux yes)
