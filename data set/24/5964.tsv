2008-02-19T09:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	for restoring grub see http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm  It's always worked great for me.
2008-04-09T08:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	you're asking for trouble if you do it that way.. if you have no other choice you'll have to reinstall grub..
2008-04-09T08:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	it's not editing the grub menu per se.. it's that windows over writes grub with its boot manager.. so you have to reinstall grub.. not a huge issue.. just a live cd and about a minute once you have the right guide.
2008-04-11T00:27:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	usually it's "grub> setup (hd0,1) or something similar
2008-04-11T00:27:00.000Z	ubuntu	Scunizi	 what should i do in my case
2008-04-11T00:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	follow the guide here.. http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm.. it's very easy to follow.
2008-04-11T00:28:00.000Z	ubuntu	Scunizi	 ok
2008-04-11T00:31:00.000Z	ubuntu	Scunizi	 grub> setup (hd0)
2008-04-11T00:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	do you have more than one harddrive?
2008-09-17T03:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	nope
2008-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	if only microsoft supported linux
2009-01-14T04:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	use gparted to unmount it then
2009-01-14T04:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	you can "sudo umount /media/<drive>" or "sudo umount /dev/<drive>"
2010-01-28T02:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	ubuntu	xorg.conf doesn't control resolution in 9.10+ .. xrandr does.. could be the system isn't receiving the information from your monitor to properly set it up.. could be that SIS is just a pain to setup.. google xrandr for instructions and also search the ubuntuforums.org for info on your shipset..
