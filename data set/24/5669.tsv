2008-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	Slayer		Ah
2008-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	Slayer		When was it re-named?
2008-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	Slayer		O.o
2008-11-20T02:46:00.000Z	Slayer		I've alway heard Linux
2008-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	Slayer		Alright, now to find Xubuntu
2008-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	Slayer		Any certain files I should back up before clearing my C drive?
2008-11-20T02:48:00.000Z	Slayer		Will it come with Firefox pre-installed?
2008-11-20T02:49:00.000Z	Slayer		ah, ok
2008-11-20T02:51:00.000Z	Slayer		One more question
2008-11-20T02:51:00.000Z	Slayer		Does Linux have any kind of Garageband or anything, like Mac does?
2008-11-20T02:51:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	Garageband would be...?
2008-11-20T02:52:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	what sort of music program? there are many music programs in Ubuntu
2008-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	don't worry, you don't need to write any program
2008-11-20T02:53:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	just please describe in more detail what you want the program to do
2008-11-20T02:55:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	that's still a bit confusing. Audacity and many other "sound editors" can record *sounds* from the microphone, and then let you do editing (copy&paste) as well as several effects on them. some will also let you work with multiple tracks. but those programs won't let you do *music*, they have no concept of "notes"
2008-11-20T02:56:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	on the opposite side, there are MIDI-only programs that work with scores
2008-11-20T02:56:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	but those generally have no synthesizer abilities
2008-11-20T02:57:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	download the 32-bit one if you have to ask - that's my advice
2008-11-20T03:01:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	disks have no drive letters like C in Ubuntu, so i don't understand your question
2008-11-20T03:03:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	the Ubuntu installer will let you select whether you want to shrink your Windows partition to make space for Ubuntu, or use the entire drive and wipe Windows
2008-11-20T03:03:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	not if it's a Touch
2009-03-04T23:36:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	yes, unless you have an alternate cd avaialble. what do you need to do? you might use another computer to achieve it
2009-03-04T23:38:00.000Z	LjL	Slayer	well anyway even if you do have the alternate cd, it'll only let you install a very restricted selection of packages. so again, just what exactly do you need to do?
2009-03-04T23:39:00.000Z	Slayer	LjL	i need to install these two - network-manager-openvpn and network-manager-pptp
