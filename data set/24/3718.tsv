2007-11-24T00:21:00.000Z	pike_	windego40	only issue i noticed is that in gtkpod when making playlists you need to drag em to to top of the tree on left or they dont show up in ipod
2007-11-24T00:22:00.000Z	pike_	windego40	it creates em near bottom and they dont show up
2007-11-24T00:23:00.000Z	windego40	pike_	for mine it says it could not open itunesDB.ext
2007-11-24T00:25:00.000Z	pike_	windego40	there is one thing i have to do routinely every time i launch gtkpod
2007-11-24T00:27:00.000Z	pike_	windego40	i forget the file name but after ipod is mounted under /media/ipod or whatever there is a iPod_something or something like that under that folder there is a file and a file.bak i cp file.bak file and then relaunch gtkpod
