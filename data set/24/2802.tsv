2011-05-13T01:02:00.000Z	freeman_		it was giving him a token error so i said sudo passwd username
2011-05-13T01:02:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	that can lead to *big* troubles with an encrypted home directory !
2011-05-13T01:05:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	the password is used to gain access to the encrypted passphrase for decrypting the home directory - if a user changes it herself that process is adapted as well. If root does it the connection is lost and if she hasn't recorded her passphrase she will never be able to access her data
2011-05-13T01:07:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	who would forget their passphrase? :P
2011-05-13T01:08:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	I beg your pardon? the initially set passphrase is a 50 character random string
2011-05-13T01:09:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	when you log in for the first time it prompts you to change it
2011-05-13T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	you have obviously never installed the system with "encrypted home directory" . you should not change the passphrase but record it and store it in a safe place. the encryption needs a *very* strong password to be of any value
2011-05-13T01:12:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	actually my home directory is encrypted right now.
2011-05-13T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	did you record the passphrase? (I have no idea how to change it, I admit)
2011-05-13T01:14:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	no i made it my normal password. i would never record 50 digit anything. not even my wpa password :P
2011-05-13T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	I think we are talking about different things here  - the long passphrase is actually the encryption key, it *must* be long and should be random
2011-05-13T01:17:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	its possible. i am pretty sure its the right thing
2011-05-13T01:18:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	can you tell me (in short) or point me to some docu what you did to change it?
2011-05-13T01:19:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	when i booted after install a terminal popped up asking me to change it
2011-05-13T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	on plain ubuntu?
2011-05-13T01:20:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	64 bit, yeah
2011-05-13T01:21:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	i think if you forget it youre screwed
2011-05-13T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	well, my experience differs greatly here - and mind you a "short" encryption key won't protect you very well
2011-05-13T01:22:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	the only thing i am hiding it porn. and its not embarrassing porn so if you can get by encrypted file system then you can get in
2011-05-13T01:23:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	I really don't care about your data - but please don't give potentially harmful advice
2011-05-13T01:24:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	i still dont understand what's so harmful about it
2011-05-13T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	once again: as long as you access your system with "your" password it is used to decrypt the encryption key, so you have access to your data. That remains so when you change your password yourself. but when "root" does it the chain is broken (or when you lose your system)
2011-05-13T01:28:00.000Z	freeman_	guntbert	so what should he do when using passwd as a user gives him a token error?
2011-05-13T01:30:00.000Z	guntbert	freeman_	he gets that error with sudo too ( if I remember correctly ) - something in the system must be broken - that should be investigated
