2007-03-25T15:27:00.000Z	floyd^		i installed ubuntu but i cant seem to be able to work out the networking
2007-03-25T15:28:00.000Z	floyd^		i have a static ip and i tried to set a connection in System-Networking
2007-03-25T15:28:00.000Z	floyd^		but the gateway ip won't stay there
2007-03-25T15:28:00.000Z	floyd^		each time i open it up again the gateway setting disappears
2007-03-25T15:28:00.000Z	floyd^		needless to say i have no internet
2007-03-25T15:29:00.000Z	floyd^		i added gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx in /etc/network/interfaces and then downed and upped the networking interface and still nothing
2007-03-25T15:29:00.000Z	floyd^		any suggestions?
2007-03-25T15:29:00.000Z	floyd^		how do i do that? :(
