2008-10-31T03:27:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	if you have no clue, then just accept the maintainer's version
2008-11-11T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	there's some bug on bugs.ubuntu.com about it that I found eralier.  Let me know if you can't find it
2008-11-11T06:57:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	hm found several bugs reporting that issue, but just old ones

2008-11-11T07:05:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	thank you
2009-02-15T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	synaptic
2009-02-15T01:15:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	synaptic? for what?
2009-02-15T01:15:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	the answer to your question
2009-02-15T01:16:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	install cmake using synaptic, then read the documentation for your software
2009-02-15T01:16:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	ah got it
2009-07-26T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	what SDK?
2009-07-26T17:26:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	in this case the ADT
2009-07-26T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	if you don't need it system wide, put it in your ~.  If you need it system-wide, I'd use /opt if it lacks a "unixy" structure and /usr/local/ otherwise
2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	Dulak what is /usr/local/ actually supposed to be used for?
2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	software you install without using the package manager
2009-07-26T17:30:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	yeah was just wondering ;-)
2009-07-26T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	elementz	google "filesystem hierarchy standard"
2009-07-26T17:31:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	thx
2009-07-28T17:51:00.000Z	elementz	jrib	good to know. ;-)
