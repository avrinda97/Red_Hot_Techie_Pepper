2004-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	buffalo		does anyone know how to customize which packages get installed with ubuntu? i tried both custom (which just does minimal) and expert (which just gives you a menu). i know what's included is already minimal, but there are some things I want to leave out.
2004-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	use aptitude or synaptic or apt-get
2004-11-05T15:59:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	known issue, base your decision on the filename
2004-11-05T16:00:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	okay, so I'll redownload and hope to get the final this time
2004-11-05T16:00:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	huh?
2004-11-05T16:00:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	if you downloaed one names -release-, it's the release iso
2004-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	oh, i thought you meant base it on the DISKNAME (as opposed to the md5sum)
2004-11-05T16:01:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	no
2004-11-05T16:02:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	nevermind then, thanks, i have the "release"
2004-11-05T16:03:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	cool
2004-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	the base you get with expert isn't minimal enough?
2004-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	what i meant was, i do want office/firefox, just not gaim (as an example)
2004-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	the custom install doesn't include gaim
2004-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	and you can remove gaim from the default install if you like, too
2004-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	right, but it doesn't include office/firefox or even gnome either
2004-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	er, so what do you want? you can build up from custom or build down from desktop.
2004-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	how do i remove gaim (and other stuff) from the default install. is that the .disk/base_exclude that Kamion is referring to?
2004-11-05T16:12:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	ok, i think I get what you mean now (build up from custom or build down from desktop). thanks again
2004-11-05T16:12:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	np
2004-11-05T16:13:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	you've not used a Debian-based distro before?
2004-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	no, but i have heard of apt, so i just have to learn it now
2004-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	ah, right
2004-11-05T16:24:00.000Z	bob2	buffalo	fwiw, "dsh" + "apt-get remove gaim gnomemeeting..." can make that easier
2004-11-05T16:26:00.000Z	buffalo	bob2	thanks
