2012-09-29T22:55:00.000Z	bekks	dws	There is no free space to create a new partition.
2012-09-29T22:56:00.000Z	dws	bekks	look at /dev/sda7 , i created it to install win 7
2012-09-29T22:57:00.000Z	dws	bekks	but i d'nt know how to make it physical device
2012-09-29T22:58:00.000Z	bekks	dws	You dont create physical devices. Your harddisk is a physical device, thats all.
2012-09-29T22:58:00.000Z	bekks	dws	Partitions always are created on physical devices.
2012-09-29T22:58:00.000Z	dws	bekks	but why win 7 d'nt recognising this partition to install
2012-09-29T22:59:00.000Z	bekks	dws	So which partition do you want to resize to have enough space to create another partition?
2012-09-29T22:59:00.000Z	bekks	dws	Because you have NO FREE SPACE for creating a partition.
2012-09-29T22:59:00.000Z	dws	bekks	i want to use /dev/sda7  (ntfs)
2012-09-29T23:00:00.000Z	bekks	dws	Impossible, because sda7 is a logical partition contained in the extended partition sda2.
2012-09-29T23:01:00.000Z	dws	bekks	so, whats the solution for me ? is their any solution for my problem
2012-09-29T23:01:00.000Z	bekks	dws	With your current disk layout - I dont think there is a solution.
2012-09-29T23:01:00.000Z	dws	bekks	i d'nt want to format my ubuntu drive (its contain all my data)
2012-09-29T23:02:00.000Z	bekks	dws	Then create a backup of all valuable data before creating a new layout an reinstalling your computer.
2012-09-29T23:03:00.000Z	dws	bekks	please ! any other method than backup .backup take lot of time .Please
2012-09-29T23:03:00.000Z	bekks	dws	There is no other way. No.
2012-09-29T23:03:00.000Z	bekks	dws	And data without a backup isnt valuable data.
