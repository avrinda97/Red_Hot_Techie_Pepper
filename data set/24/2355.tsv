2009-09-20T02:51:00.000Z	RegressLess		Can someone tell me how to make an app launch in full screen?
2009-09-20T02:51:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	well, the app has to support full screen
2009-09-20T02:52:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	is there a way to make a windowed app that doesn't have a maximize option bigger?
2009-09-20T02:52:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	lower screen resolution
2009-09-20T02:53:00.000Z	RegressLess		:P
2009-09-20T02:53:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	can I cause auto screen resize when starting an app?
2009-09-20T02:55:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	depends on the app.
2009-09-20T02:55:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	usually if it's full-screen capable, it will conform to whatever the current resolution is
2009-09-20T02:56:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	it's zsnes and it's not full screen compatible that I know of
2009-09-20T02:57:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	in that case, I recommend snes9x. it's fullscreen capable if you're root, but if you stretch the window, it will conform automatically
2009-09-20T02:59:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	turns out I'm an idiot
2009-09-20T02:59:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	it happens to everyone
2009-09-20T03:00:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	zsnes does have fullscreen option
2009-09-20T03:00:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	oh, cool
2009-09-20T03:00:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	so, back to what I was asking before, how do I make it start in full screen
2009-09-20T03:01:00.000Z	RegressLess		I should be able to edit the launch command, right?
2009-09-20T03:01:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	I should be able to edit the launch command, right?
2009-09-20T03:01:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	how are you trying to use zsnes? from the gui or terminal?
2009-09-20T03:01:00.000Z	RegressLess		gui
2009-09-20T03:02:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	gui
2009-09-20T03:02:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	open a terminal and type 'zsnes' by itself to see what options are available - should be able to edit the properties of the gui to give it the options you want
2009-09-20T03:06:00.000Z	RegressLess	Gnea	typed zsnes in terminal and it gave me a bunch of stuff, but I don't know what I'm doing. PM?
2009-09-20T03:07:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	no.
2009-09-20T03:07:00.000Z	Gnea	RegressLess	most of those are arguments - so like this:  zsnes -argument game.nes
