2010-01-26T02:04:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	 ok.. however i think ill have to add a new repo, because i dont have any result on "wine-gecko"
2010-01-26T02:05:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	its in main repo
2010-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	well the multiverse, but its standard ubuntu repo
2010-01-26T02:07:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	well i found Wine HQ on my software sources.. i selected it ..i dont know if i done rigth, but i think ill be able to find gecko .. just a sec
2010-01-26T02:08:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	its installed it itself when its needed it, for me...
2010-01-26T02:09:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	i found it.. but i had to add "wine HQ" to the software sources
2010-01-26T02:10:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	what apps have you  tryed running with wine ? any game s?
2010-01-26T02:14:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	I dont have winehq added and its in ubuntus repos..  ive only tried half-life2,  was a little buggy, like the flashlight didnt actually light anything up, and some textures had lighting issues...apart from that, it ran ok.  tried a few apps like photoshop and collectorz movie collector, work fine
2010-01-26T02:14:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	my experience with the wine betas, they break more than they fix
2010-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	do you think that running a game with a PC with low resources(a game that generaly whouldnt run).. that wine could give me luck?
2010-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	 i got a weak 3d card
2010-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	if it wont run native in windows dont even bother
2010-01-26T02:17:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	ok
2010-01-26T02:19:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	did you sayd the wine beta could be worse? or better ?
2010-01-26T02:19:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	they are betas..  might be ok for you..
2010-01-26T02:20:00.000Z	duffydack	_dreamy	for me, a prog like coverxp is broken with anything past 1.1.33
2010-01-26T02:20:00.000Z	_dreamy	duffydack	ok..
