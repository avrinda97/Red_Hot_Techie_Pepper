2006-07-09T11:37:00.000Z	DaddyArokh		morning all, i have a few questions about this fresh install of ubuntu. first of all, I know I didn't do the partitions right so I need to redo it. I don't know how big to make the swap part. 120 gb hdd, I want 30 gb system, and around 90gb data. how much swap should i make?
2006-07-09T11:38:00.000Z	DaddyArokh		ok, 512mb ram, so I should do around 768 mb?
2006-07-09T11:39:00.000Z	DaddyArokh		well I do a lot of video editing from the camcorder, should i make a bigger swap for that?
2006-07-09T11:40:00.000Z	DaddyArokh		edlin, does it hurt to have more swap than necessary? like will it slow it down? I let ubuntu figure out my partitions and it did the full 120gb in one, with about 1.5gb swap
2006-07-09T11:42:00.000Z	DaddyArokh		i was going to ask about the whole root/su thing too. my last escapade with linux was fedora which uses a real "root" account. I can't su in ubuntu because it never even asked me for a root password, do I just use sudo?
2006-07-09T11:42:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	yes
2006-07-09T11:43:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	if they have the password and are permitted by sudo
2006-07-09T11:44:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	it is technically very configurable, e.g. user foo may only run bar and baz.
2006-07-09T11:46:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	Look for gnucash.  I don't know if it imports Microsoft's proprietary format or not, though.
2006-07-09T11:46:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	you may be able to export the data from Money
2006-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	there's also MoneyDance and some others

2006-07-09T11:49:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	the best thing you can do is be forward-thinking when buying hardware and applications.
2006-07-09T11:50:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	digital camera should be straightforward, and likely is even easier under Linux than windows.
2006-07-09T11:52:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	But the core of what I mean is look for Linux compatibility in applications and hardware so that you're not still boxing yourself in to Windows.
2006-07-09T11:53:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	there should be a midi device you can use programs to interface with.
2006-07-09T11:53:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	google, however, turns up many interesting results.
2006-07-09T11:54:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	but for the camera, try it out.  Take some pictures, make sure your camera is set to do "PPTP" mode, and plug in the USB cable.
2006-07-09T11:55:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	come back if you have questions (though I won't always be at the keyboard)
2006-07-09T12:02:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	sure
2006-07-09T12:03:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	linux can read ntfs, but writing is iffy
2006-07-09T12:03:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	yes, fat32 would be it
2006-07-09T12:06:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	dunno; b44 is *a* 10/100 wired driver.
2006-07-09T12:09:00.000Z	Solarion	DaddyArokh	good luck!
