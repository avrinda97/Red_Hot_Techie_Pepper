2007-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	dravine		fails
2007-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	dravine		Load Error: Failed to get file information for loading. Please try loading the file again.
2007-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	dravine		no urls will work
2007-12-07T00:06:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	gnome-open is for files
2007-12-07T00:07:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	yes it is. But your command does work here for URLs too
2007-12-07T00:08:00.000Z	dravine	soundray	anytime you click a link in a gnome app, gnome-open decides what file gets to handle it
2007-12-07T00:08:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	try as another user
2007-12-07T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	perhaps
2007-12-07T00:10:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	have you done lots of customization?
2007-12-07T00:11:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	not the account, but maybe ~/.gconf*
2007-12-07T00:12:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	you can't do it while gnome is running
2007-12-07T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	did you rename or delete?
2007-12-07T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	moved entirely?
2007-12-07T00:25:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	what does that mean
2007-12-07T00:26:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	did it affect gnome-open's behaviour?
2007-12-07T00:27:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	can you do a 'grep -r open ~/gconfbackup'
2007-12-07T00:28:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	sorry, I meant 'grep -rl open ~/gconfbackup'
2007-12-07T00:30:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	okay, not helpful. 'grep -rl gnome-open ~/gconfbackup' ?
2007-12-07T00:37:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	scribes? Please explain
2007-12-07T00:38:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	okay
2007-12-07T00:46:00.000Z	dravine	soundray	check this out
2007-12-07T00:48:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	I see... so now you've fixed it?
2007-12-07T00:48:00.000Z	soundray	dravine	well done
