2009-06-28T21:00:00.000Z	LekisS		I need help for partitionning :( nobody can help me ? it takes only 2~5 minutes :(
2009-06-28T21:01:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	What kind of help?
2009-06-28T21:01:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	I want to install Ubuntu on my notebook and I suck at partitionning
2009-06-28T21:02:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	I just need a "plan" to do that with a 120gb HDD
2009-06-28T21:02:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	ok, do you have any other OS? Windows?
2009-06-28T21:02:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	no... I had :D but it sucks for a notebook
2009-06-28T21:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	Why yes it does :D  ... so you want one partition for / ... say 20GB, plus a swap partition (how much RAM do you have?) and a /home partition, which will fill the rest of the drive
2009-06-28T21:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	so, you will want to use manual when you get the the point in the installer where you partition the drive
2009-06-28T21:04:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	I have 1gb ram... Also, I'd like to know if I should do a /tmp partition
2009-06-28T21:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	nah, I don't think that's really useful
2009-06-28T21:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	k, so do 3GB for swap
2009-06-28T21:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	Have you decided whether you want to use ext3 or ext4?
2009-06-28T21:05:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	okay ;) So 20gb for /, 3gb for swap and the rest for /home ? is that it ?
2009-06-28T21:05:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	yep, other than choosing the filesystem for / and /home
2009-06-28T21:06:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	I don't even know the differences :D
2009-06-28T21:06:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	I mean with ext3/ext4
2009-06-28T21:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	ext3 is the default - very stable, well supported etc... ext4 is the new version that should have some good performance benefits, but as it is new it's less well supported (but it is stable)
2009-06-28T21:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		!ext4
2009-06-28T21:07:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		:O
2009-06-28T21:07:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	you think I should be using ext4 ? or not ?
2009-06-28T21:08:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	up to you... I've been saying for a while that ext4 isn't ready, but I've switched my / partition to ext4 now and I'll be switching /home soon too... a bunch of fixes have been implemented for little things, so I'd say it's ready to use now, yes
2009-06-28T21:08:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	okay ;) thank you very much :)
2009-06-28T21:08:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	LekisS	For example, my boot time was cut by about 30% because /boot is ext4 for me now
2009-06-28T21:09:00.000Z	LekisS	Mike_lifeguard	ho okay... I see why ext4 is useful ^^ thanks !
