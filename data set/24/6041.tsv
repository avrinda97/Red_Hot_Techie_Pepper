2006-02-21T16:07:00.000Z	Angel_Dex		How do i persue a friend into using Ubuntu? hes leaning towards debian unstable/fedora
2006-02-21T16:07:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Get him/her the free CDs.
2006-02-21T16:07:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	he downloaded it all
2006-02-21T16:08:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	if he can make it less restricted and noob friendly i think hed use it
2006-02-21T16:11:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	If he wants total control over every little thing, go for Gentoo.
2006-02-21T16:11:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	What the heck? How said that?
2006-02-21T16:11:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	You lied to him then.
2006-02-21T16:12:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Then you were lied to.
2006-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Dude, who is telling you all these fallacies?
2006-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	>.> idk?
2006-02-21T16:17:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	/etc/hosts
2006-02-21T16:18:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	i know of this im asking is there any problems that may occur if i make it say 51k lines long a few MB big?
2006-02-21T16:21:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Why do you have 51K lines in /etc/hosts?
2006-02-21T16:22:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	like i said i like using hte hosts file i combined about 7 hosts files from the net into one
2006-02-21T16:22:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	What is this for?
2006-02-21T16:22:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Sounds to me like it's either a makeshift nameserver or a makeshift firewall.
2006-02-21T16:23:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	As i know Linux is safe from viruses and malware tho i still use a hosts file to protect meself nomatter what and mostly to just keep the net looking clean and feeling safe Ease on the mind more then enything
2006-02-21T16:23:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Use a firewall program of some sort then, like iptables.
2006-02-21T16:24:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	Hum I feel better using the hosts FIle is there any site you may know of about Hosts files on linux? i have only found them on windows
2006-02-21T16:25:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Okay, the hosts file you'd edit is /etc/hosts. No, I don't know of any such site. Furthermore, I urge you to get a software firewall instaed of wasting your time on /etc/hosts
2006-02-21T16:25:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	what time will be wasted? I find it fun
2006-02-21T16:26:00.000Z	nitishp	Angel_Dex	Clearly our definitions of "fun" vary. Have fun spending countless hours on /etc/hosts editing.
2006-02-21T16:26:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	nitishp	Um 10 minutes max man Download the hosts files combind um with me program and replace the hosts file Simple
