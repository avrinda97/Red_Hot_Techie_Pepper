2012-02-19T07:11:00.000Z	matju		Is there some way to get Gnome Classic on Ubuntu 11.10 in a way that is not severely crippled ?
2012-02-19T07:12:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	I found that I had that issue too, I am now using gnome 3 happily though so I never bothered fixing classic...
2012-02-19T07:13:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	haven't found much that I can call happy in either Gnome 3 or Ubuntu Desktop...
2012-02-19T07:15:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	I gave unity about 2 weeks to try and break it in before deciding I didn't like it, then I switched to gnome 3, didn't like it for the first week and now I am addicted!
2012-02-19T07:15:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	what causes the addiction ?
2012-02-19T07:17:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	faster than unity, much less buggy, awesome looking interface, love that it uses the super key as well... plus with a little fiddling it's as customizable as i wan't!
2012-02-19T07:18:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	how do i get hierarchical menus instead of the all-in-one-bunch nonsense ?
2012-02-19T07:20:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	(note : Gnome 3 is what i have currently selected. I can't even find where's the system config)
2012-02-19T07:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	haven't done that as I find simply typing into the search bar a related keyword works wonders, but I can understand you want heirachial menus. try xfce as a window manager
2012-02-19T07:21:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	to find the system config without the search bar try: top left button to get app launch interface, then click the applications button (windows will be selected) then down the right side choose system
2012-02-19T07:22:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	if I install and use XFCE, do i get full access to GNOME apps ?
2012-02-19T07:23:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	Yes, they still run
2012-02-19T07:23:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	yeah, i found the system config already. Didn't look at that list, because it didn't even look like it was clickable.
2012-02-19T07:24:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	good, glad to hear it, I almost never hit the applications button though, I just use the search bar
2012-02-19T07:24:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	i mean i didn't see « System » because it didn't really look like a menu or buttons
2012-02-19T07:25:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	no, I understand that, good that you know now though
2012-02-19T07:25:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	so now, can I make Alt+Tab work properly ?
2012-02-19T07:27:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	alt+tab should work fine in gnome3, unless you can tell me what the specific issue with it is
2012-02-19T07:29:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	It groups windows of the same app together. It's slower to make the switch to another window of the same app than going to another app.
2012-02-19T07:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	just hit the "`" or "~" (tilda) key that is above tab instead of tab
2012-02-19T07:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	so alt+tab becomes alt+~
2012-02-19T07:30:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	this switches between the windows of one application, then hitting alt tab switches between apps
2012-02-19T07:31:00.000Z	matju	hydrox24	oh GREAT ! :) I was feeling so handicapped, i had the impression of being on OSX.
2012-02-19T07:31:00.000Z	hydrox24	matju	good to hear, yeh it took me  awhile to figure out too!
