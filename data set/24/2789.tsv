2009-06-29T02:47:00.000Z	Bodsda_		does anyone know if there is a small, neat onscreen keyboard app that just displays what buttons im pressing? I dont want a full blown touch typing teachme type program, just summit simple
2009-06-29T02:49:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	you can enable on an on-screen keyboard in accessibility options, then you would have a reference point if that's what you are looking for.
2009-06-29T02:50:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	im running fluxbox
2009-06-29T02:50:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	gtkeyboard
2009-06-29T02:51:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	no such command or package
2009-06-29T02:52:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	sudo apt-get install gtkeyboard
2009-06-29T02:52:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	E: Couldn't find package gtkeyboard
2009-06-29T02:53:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	do you have a "control center" entry on your menus - look for accesibility
2009-06-29T02:54:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	xmag and GOK, but i need to log out for GOK to work.. really dont want to log out
2009-06-29T02:55:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	not sure what to tell you.
2009-06-29T02:56:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	tell me to log out probably :)
2009-06-29T02:59:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	what was the problem with gtkeyboard?
2009-06-29T02:59:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	it wants me to log out before it will workk
2009-06-29T03:00:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	why problem logging out (not shut down)
2009-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	takes too long, and I dont want to have to restart firefox and my terminal... guess im being a bit pedantic?
2009-06-29T03:01:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	Okay :)
2009-06-29T03:02:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	you have synaptic?
2009-06-29T03:08:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	gok does not seem to be an onscreen keyboard.. or its not working -- its just a window with 9 or so buttons that do nothing
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	GOK is gnome based
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	yes...
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	you should try gtkeyboard
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	Bodsda_	mdg	the package does not exist in jaunty
2009-06-29T03:10:00.000Z	mdg	Bodsda_	try googling gtkeyboard - there are other sources for it
