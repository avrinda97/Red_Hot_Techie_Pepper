2007-08-31T11:41:00.000Z	Qodosh		What is the UID of initial admin account on ubuntu?
2007-08-31T11:42:00.000Z	Qodosh		I took away admin privalege from my only admin account and made it a normal user from KDE admin tools. I was wondering, what is the right UID to set it back to the way it was?
2007-08-31T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	add it to the admin group
2007-08-31T11:43:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	Command?
2007-08-31T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	you can do it through the same admin tools
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	my admin tools disappeared since he has less privs now
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	that was the problem.
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	Ah, well, you won't be able to do it on that account, obviously.
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	thats why I su into root, and did command
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	Oh, 'only', I read 'old'.  You'll need to... erm, why do you have a root password?
2007-08-31T11:44:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	I tried to change uid
2007-08-31T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	Why?
2007-08-31T11:45:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	I did  usermod -u to change the uid back to admin, it messed stuff up, so I changed it back to 1000
2007-08-31T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	usermod -G admin -a username
2007-08-31T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	you don't need to have a root password, you don't need to use the root account.
2007-08-31T11:47:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	For the tasks I do I need root. It keeps saying I need to be root when I do server management.
2007-08-31T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	Ubuntu uses sudo instead of root.
2007-08-31T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	and for stuff like this, where we've messed up sudo, we have the recovery console.  (obviously, try not to mess up sudo)
2007-08-31T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	If you need to do a bunch of stuff, use `sudo -i` to start a root shell.
2007-08-31T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	Check out that page, it explains the benefits rather well
2007-08-31T11:51:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	Alright, well thanks for the help, I forgot -a when typing usermod -G lol
2007-08-31T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Qodosh	SSH isn't the only remote service you have
2007-08-31T11:55:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	On my fedora server it is. I disabled everything else.
2007-08-31T11:57:00.000Z	Qodosh	Flannel	The only thing I see as a real benefit in my case is just having one less password to worry about.
