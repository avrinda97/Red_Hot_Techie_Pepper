2007-10-11T08:57:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-10-11T08:58:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	kk.
2007-10-11T09:02:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	dapper does not have that package
2007-10-11T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	dapper does not have that package, you don't add it.  You probably want something else (hint: apt-cache search linux headers)
2007-10-11T09:05:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	Sorry I stil don't understand what I need to do. =/
2007-10-11T09:05:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	what are you trying to accomplish?
2007-10-11T09:06:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	I'm updating my video card drivers
2007-10-11T09:07:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	what is wrong with the version in the repos?
2007-10-11T09:07:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	I'm updating my VIA graphics drivers from the crap version to the 3d version so I can install feisty
2007-10-11T09:09:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	why not install just install feisty?
2007-10-11T09:10:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	are you doing a fresh feisty install?
2007-10-11T09:10:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	yeah off the live cd
2007-10-11T09:11:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	use the alternate cd to install and then resolve the graphics card issues if there are any
2007-10-11T09:12:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	thats what I'm trying to do now, I'm using edgy right now to talk to you. and I'm trying to resolve my graphics card issuer
2007-10-11T09:13:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	what you do now on edgy does not affect your fresh feistf install.  And you posted a *dapper* sources, not an edgy one
2007-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	sorry I didn't mean edgy
2007-10-11T09:14:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	was having some confusion over the nick names earlier. =p
2007-10-11T09:15:00.000Z	jrib	bean|EndersGame	still, you should use the alternate cd to install feisty and then resolve the graphics card issues if there are any
2007-10-11T09:15:00.000Z	bean|EndersGame	jrib	Okay I'll go try that now
