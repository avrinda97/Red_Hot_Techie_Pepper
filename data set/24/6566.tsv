2005-09-20T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	do not paste
2005-09-20T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	do not paste here use paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-20T15:33:00.000Z	Krille	ompaul	i cant paste ...  i can "quote" but thats it
2005-09-20T15:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	if you have web access you can use that pastebin
2005-09-20T15:34:00.000Z	Krille	ompaul	yeah well i'm not sure theres any point in typing it all ....   i mean, i cant copy and paste this and theres a bit of text to type. i think the machine doesnt see the NIC.
2005-09-20T15:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	what kind of nic is in it?
2005-09-20T15:35:00.000Z	Krille	ompaul	well, its actually very very built in
2005-09-20T15:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	hoary / breezy ?
2005-09-20T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	emm possible silly question it is the wired nic or the wireless you are trying to use ?
2005-09-20T15:43:00.000Z	Krille	ompaul	its the built in wired nic
2005-09-20T15:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	I'm very surprised at that
2005-09-20T15:44:00.000Z	Krille	ompaul	i believe its hoary.
2005-09-20T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	if it is not the cable, if your happy with the console I do have one suggestion that might help - but I am far from sure with this (being an x86 user) , YMMV etc - however as the machine boots, it offers the chance to install a server version - if this is acceptable to you then may I suggest you give it a shot, when it is finished you do >> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop << and start from there
2005-09-20T15:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Krille	that sound - unsafe -
