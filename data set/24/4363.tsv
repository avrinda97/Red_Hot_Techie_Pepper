2009-10-07T23:52:00.000Z	dragon		Is there a command-line tool to change the apt mirrors without modifying the sources.list file?

2009-10-07T23:52:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	no.
2009-10-07T23:53:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	there is a GUI tool for doing that, so I'm still wondering.
2009-10-07T23:53:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	sources.list gets modified no matter what. no way to avoid it.
2009-10-07T23:54:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	I never said I wanted to avoid it.
2009-10-07T23:54:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	What I said was ambiguous, sorry.
2009-10-07T23:54:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	then I misunderstood what you wrote.
2009-10-07T23:58:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	I can't find one... never had a problem doing it manually anyway
2009-10-07T23:59:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	I can do it manually, but I wasn't sure which ones to leave untouched. I'm trying to change all possible sources to mirrors.us.kernel.org.
2009-10-07T23:59:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	then use the search-and-replace in vim
2009-10-07T23:59:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	and which ones should I replace?
2009-10-08T00:00:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	us.archive.ubuntu.com?
2009-10-08T00:00:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	probably anything like us.archive.ubuntu.com
2009-10-08T00:00:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	yeah
2009-10-08T00:00:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	Would it be ok to replace security.ubuntu.com as well?
2009-10-08T00:00:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	doubt it
2009-10-08T00:07:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	it worked. Another question - would it be reasonable to expect the following command to work with every system?
2010-01-23T12:50:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	did you install the plugin the iceroot way?
2010-09-17T15:48:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	perhaps you're not paying attention, do you have a real question?
2010-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	I used to support in this channel months ago, and eventually stopped hanging around as the seriousness went down.
2010-09-17T15:51:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	perhaps you were dragged down by trolls, I've been here for years and the support has stayed serious
2010-09-17T15:53:00.000Z	dragon	Gnea	not really. At some point most of the messages used to be long and relevant. Now, most of them are 3-4 words long.
2010-09-17T15:54:00.000Z	Gnea	dragon	then you're not reading right.
