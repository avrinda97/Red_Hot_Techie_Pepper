2010-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		Oh, someone already mentioned it.
2010-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		dogmatic69:
2010-10-06T16:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		err, sorry
2010-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	dogmatic69 there is a amd64 version of flash again, its running much better then the 32bit versionwith the 64bit wrapper (default in ubuntu)
2010-10-06T16:19:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	yes
2010-10-06T16:19:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	normally for apache tomcat
2011-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	of course vim is supporting it
2011-11-01T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	as it seems you never learned vim
2011-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	vim and emacs
2011-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	but maybe you know an editor which is more powerfull then vim/emacs? i would be really interested in something like that
2011-11-01T18:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding	iceroot	i learned it well enough to write code in it
2011-11-01T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	that is not hard, pressing i writting code, pressing :wq
2011-11-01T18:30:00.000Z	tensorpudding	iceroot	i learned more than that
2011-11-01T18:30:00.000Z	tensorpudding	iceroot	basically everything you can do with gedit plus some extra
2011-11-01T18:31:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	no need for an editor-flamewar
2011-11-01T18:32:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	and it doesnt matter if you like vim or emacs more but my sentecne "vim/emacs are the most powerfull editors" should be true
2011-11-01T18:32:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	depending on your .vimrc :)
2011-12-08T00:20:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	i286 and lower for example
2011-12-08T00:20:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	yes
2011-12-08T00:21:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	mmu imo
2011-12-08T00:23:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	you dont want linux when you have amigaos :)
2012-02-15T17:12:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	no
2012-02-15T17:12:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	not if you are using everyting from the repos
2012-02-15T17:12:00.000Z	iceroot	tensorpudding	then normally everything should fit
