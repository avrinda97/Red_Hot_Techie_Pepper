2008-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	thats because of stupid US laws that say decrypting DVDs is illegal
2008-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	that has what you need
2008-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	what is medidbutnu?
2008-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	it's a repository with DVD decryptors and codecs for windows media files
2008-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	ok i'll try it rite now thanks
2008-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	so does that mean most people having ubuntu can't play DVD?
2008-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	no, it means we ignore the law
2008-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	haha i like that answer
2008-03-11T10:10:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	well the MPAA went and got Congress to make a law saying that it's illegal to break any encryption...and they encrypt their disks so that's how they want to stop piracy...so then you have to buy software like PowerDVD on Windows to do it...which is kinda unfair
2008-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	it turns out it's *really* easy to break their encryption, so they needed the law to keep anyone from breaking it in a week
2008-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	so even if i install Gstreamer plugins it wont work?
2008-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	that'll play stuff like MP3s
2008-03-11T10:11:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	you still need the plugins to get the DVD to play once it's decrypted
2008-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	oh ok i'll gonna try to install medibuntu...brb
2008-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	but libdvdcss2 is what breaks the decryption, and you have to decrypt before you can use a codec on it
2008-03-11T10:16:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	i copy and paste the commands in the terminal and ran the update still not working, what am i doing wrong?
2008-03-11T10:19:00.000Z	macogw	pstv	ummm did you install libdvdcss2 after you finished?  and ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2008-03-11T10:19:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	no, can i find that in sypnatic?
2008-03-11T10:20:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	i'm install it rite now brb
2008-03-11T10:22:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	i installed the libdvdcss2 but still doesn't work
2008-03-11T10:23:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	this is the error i'm getting "Totem could not play 'dvd:///media/cdrom0'. there is no plugin to play this movie"
2008-03-11T10:29:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	i re install the ubunt-restricted-extra and is working now thank i appreciate the help
2008-03-11T10:34:00.000Z	pstv	macogw	it is working now but the movie doesn't look too sharp..any idea?
