2010-10-02T03:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Hello! I have a triple-boot system with OSX, Mac, and Windows on my Apple desktop. This has been working flawlessly and still is. However, I would like to add a fourth partition. I would like to resize the Ubuntu partition, and have ample space to do that. However, can I just simply drag and resize the existing Ubuntu partition from the liveCD? I do not want any data loss and would just like to shrink the existing Ubuntu partition an
2010-10-02T03:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_		d make another parititon. Thanks so much in advance!
2010-10-02T04:00:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	back it up to one of the others first?
2010-10-02T04:01:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	st__, I have an external hard drive which I could theoretically use for backups. Would I just need to back up the Ubuntu partition? If so, how? Also, can I non-destructively resize my Lucid partition?
2010-10-02T04:01:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	well what do you really have on it of any value?
2010-10-02T04:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	I have an apache web server that I actively use, a samba server, lots of stuff in ~, and lots of applications. It has been and will continue to be my main work parition.
2010-10-02T04:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Losing data is not an option.
2010-10-02T04:03:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	technically, as ubuntu is a Linux, you could tar the entire root and back it up, then if things go wrong, do a clean install to the new lower partition size, then restore from the tar
2010-10-02T04:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Okay, how exactly would I go about restoring from the tar?
2010-10-02T04:04:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	you'll need to backup from livecd too, i'd read into the tar manual page
2010-10-02T04:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Understood, I am actually in the liveCD right now (I don't plan on doing anything though). I can tar the Lucid partition just fine, but how exactly do I restore the new system?
2010-10-02T04:06:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	nuke the partition, format it as EXT3 or 4, extract the tar archive back to it, then fix GRUB2 (assuming it's a GRUB2 setup)
2010-10-02T04:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Okay. Now that I think about this, the trouble of making functional and reliable backups for three different OSs is a little more trouble than it's worth. Thanks for your help though. Oh, and is Lucid Grub2?
2010-10-02T04:08:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	it is indeed!
2010-10-02T04:08:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	personally, i'd just get another disk ;)
2010-10-02T04:09:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Wait.. another disk? I have an external hard drive if that's what you mean.
2010-10-02T04:09:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	nah internal second ;)
2010-10-02T04:10:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	I wish. This is Apple hardware we're talking about.. in order to do that I need a 20 pound suction cup, plyers, a wrench, and a signed autograph of steve jobs :)
2010-10-02T04:10:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	lol ouch, one of those - which type is it may i ask?
2010-10-02T04:11:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	It is a 2008 iMac 24''. I got it for my Bar Mitzvah at a time when I was on a little love fest with Apple.. then I got into Linux.. :)
2010-10-02T04:12:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	hehe, has your Ubuntu use on it been plain sailing, compatibility wise etc? i think the community lacks some decent feedback on mac hardware use
2010-10-02T04:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	It's an interesting story. I tried a few months after I got the iMac to put the then-current 9.04 on it.. I don't think the thing even booted. (Granted, I couldn't program my way out of a paper bag back then let alone find my away around a linux system). I tried 9.10 and had better luck, and used it for a while, but I stopped because I wasn't capable enough to use it over OS X at the time. A few borks (due to my own experi
2010-10-02T04:18:00.000Z	daftykins	ubuntu_	cool :) thanks for that, very interesting
2010-10-02T04:19:00.000Z	ubuntu_	daftykins	Yup :) Thanks again for your help, I gotta run -- it's dinner time!
