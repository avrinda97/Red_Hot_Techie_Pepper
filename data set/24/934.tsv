2011-02-27T09:11:00.000Z	keithclark		I cannot upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10.  I get the following: http://pastebin.com/zE2CtXHn
2011-02-27T09:12:00.000Z	keithclark		Maybe a big bug in ubuntu?
2011-02-27T09:13:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	did you add a ppa to the repositories, add an unsupported repository or turn off your automatic updates?
2011-02-27T09:14:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	nope, fresh install
2011-02-27T09:15:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	then that sounds wrong. Try doing: sudo apt-get update - then try upgrading again
2011-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	nope, same problem.
2011-02-27T09:19:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	then please file a bug report as requested
2011-02-27T09:22:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	I must say, I'm a little stunned at the supposedly largest Linux distro having such a basic problem as upgrading.  Very, very disappointing.
2011-02-27T09:23:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	I agree. I am still using Lucid for that very reason
2011-02-27T09:23:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	time to move on I think!
2011-02-27T09:38:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	could you please paste the result of: /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-02-27T09:41:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	my apologies, that should be: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-02-27T09:41:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	V
2011-02-27T09:42:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	http://pastebin.com/G7bYkPs1
2011-02-27T09:47:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	add this line to the end of that list: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner
2011-02-27T09:47:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	then do sudo apt-get update again
2011-02-27T09:51:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	same problem.  Ubuntu broken
2011-02-27T09:53:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	then sorry, but I'm out of ideas. Were I in your shoes I'd forget abt the upgrade and just install 10.10 from CD
2011-02-27T09:53:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	nah, move on.....no time for broken distros!
2011-02-27T09:54:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	nothing wrong with Lucid
2011-02-27T09:54:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	apparently yes
2011-02-27T09:55:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	that was tongue in cheek
2011-02-27T09:55:00.000Z	keithclark	wedwo-	Oh, sorry about that.
2011-02-27T09:56:00.000Z	wedwo-	keithclark	keep asking, soon enough someone who has experienced your prob will be along
