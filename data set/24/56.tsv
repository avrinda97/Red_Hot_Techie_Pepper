2012-09-15T19:12:00.000Z	araxis		i guess ermm, thats not a good description of what i want..
2012-09-15T19:13:00.000Z	araxis		i wanted to have these 2 servers work together or act as one system, i dont know if thats a reasonable expectation
2012-09-15T19:13:00.000Z	araxis		they're really old, like, original xeons i believe
2012-09-15T19:14:00.000Z	araxis		no particular reason fidel, i just got these servers because i wanted to play around with the hardware and stuff
2012-09-15T19:14:00.000Z	araxis		i thought it would be cool to explore set up one server, then i thought it would be cooler to have multiple machines be connected together
2012-09-15T19:15:00.000Z	araxis		the long term goal isnt much, probably host my mud on it, and maybe others
2012-09-15T19:16:00.000Z	araxis		complicated for me anyway
2012-09-15T19:17:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	i use an old server for my desktop machine, noiesy but i like it.  whats the make of yours?
2012-09-15T19:19:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	they are pentium 3 xeons i think, with raid scsi drives and 2gb ram
2012-09-15T19:19:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	and each system is dual cpu
2012-09-15T19:22:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	sounds usable, i just load the ubuntu desktop and play with it for a while.  got a video card?
2012-09-15T19:23:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	indeed i do :)
2012-09-15T19:25:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	my house is turning in to a sauna
2012-09-15T19:27:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	oh yes, for about the heat.  what are they, 5u's?
2012-09-15T19:28:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	4u's
2012-09-15T19:30:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	ive been pleasantly surprised by these servers performance. maybe i had a prejudice against p3's idk, i thought theyd be awful
2012-09-15T19:31:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	but when i started them up and they had windows 2003 server installed, they ran really smooth and quickly. im guessing i didnt give the dual cpu thing enough credit, or maybe its the scsi drives
2012-09-15T19:31:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	not sure
2012-09-15T19:31:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	dual p3's sound like a good deal to me
2012-09-15T19:33:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	if you want to see the case http://imagebin.org/228520
2012-09-15T19:33:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	1ghz
2012-09-15T19:35:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	if i remember right, thats the top of the line p3
2012-09-15T19:36:00.000Z	araxis	jerrrys	its very close, they may have gone a little faster but not by much
2012-09-15T19:38:00.000Z	jerrrys	araxis	good luck, im out of here :)
