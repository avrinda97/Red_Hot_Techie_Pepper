2008-10-29T03:26:00.000Z	erisco		I want to connect to both a wireless and a wired network. the wireless network as an internet gateway, but the wired network does not. In fact, I want this computer to be the internet gateway on the wired network. how do I do this? in my network manager I cannot seem to simultaneously connect to two networks
2008-10-29T03:27:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	try "routed", a program, routing daemon
2008-10-29T03:27:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	google i
2008-10-29T03:32:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	I think your network manager just sets the primary network device, which to use to go to Internet. but in fact you're connected to both (if there are no problems like with IPs or something... )
2008-10-29T03:41:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	I said for it to start after services, not interfaces
2008-10-29T03:32:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	I found this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370 but its 3 years old
2008-10-29T03:32:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	any ideas where I can learn how to setup ics?
2008-10-29T03:35:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	I think the howto you provided is just fine. If you think you can follow the steps, there shouldn't be any problem :)
2008-10-29T03:37:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	"routed" as I suggested before was the first thing that came on my mind, it's probably old by now. As you can see, Googling is really helpful, you managed it on your own :)
2008-10-29T03:38:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	it says "Reconfigure ipmasq to start after networking has been started"... is this after network interfaces are brought up or network services?
2008-10-29T03:40:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	looks like I made the wrong choice then...
2008-10-29T03:41:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	I hope I can just back up to that step
2008-10-29T03:41:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	why? what's wrong?
2008-10-29T03:42:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	it shouldn't be a problem, you can try it and then reconfigure
2008-10-29T03:42:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	if it wouldn't work
2008-10-29T03:43:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	now wicd says I am connected to the wired network
2008-10-29T03:43:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	yet I am still talking to you
2008-10-29T03:44:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	bleh... weird things... I don't like 'em
2008-10-29T03:44:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	you see, you're still connected over both interfaces
2008-10-29T03:45:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	I dunno, did you see it twice?
2008-10-29T03:45:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	yes you are
2008-10-29T03:45:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	I said "testing123" twice...
2008-10-29T03:45:00.000Z	bremby	erisco	yes, you did :)
2008-10-29T03:46:00.000Z	erisco	bremby	so wicd is simple setting the "default" interface, then
