2007-10-21T05:47:00.000Z	joanki		now that i've installed g++ how do i get gcc?
2007-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	joanki		and gdb
2007-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	joanki	nrp	i already did what you said with the word g++ at the end
2007-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	joanki		is that the same thing?
2007-10-21T05:49:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	if you installed build-essential, gcc and gdb are there
2007-10-21T05:49:00.000Z	joanki		how do i make them run?
2007-10-21T05:49:00.000Z	joanki		i typed g++ i typed gcc
2007-10-21T05:49:00.000Z	joanki		nothing happened
2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	joanki	nrp	was that just a totally dumb question .... how do i get gcc to run?
2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	are you sure you installed build-essential?
2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	it's just 'gcc'
2007-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	joanki		i typed sudo apt-get install build-essential g++
2007-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	joanki		when i type gcc, it says : gcc: no input files
2007-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	hmm, well g++ would come with build-essential anyway
2007-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	nrp	joanki	ok good, that means you have gcc, you just have to give it a file to compile
