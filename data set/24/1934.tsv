2009-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	what happened? I an no expert but I can try to help
2009-06-20T05:57:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	oh, sorry I really don't know too much about xorg...did you change monitors or cards?
2009-06-20T05:58:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	ah, so how did you go about updating?
2009-06-20T05:59:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	I don't think you need to reinstall.
2009-06-20T06:00:00.000Z	oenone1	dannyD1	what do i do then sir , to fix this
2009-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	what type of card? Nvidia?
2009-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	oenone1	dannyD1	ati radeon 4870
2009-06-20T06:01:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	and you downloaded the driver from their site or from synaptic?
2009-06-20T06:03:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	I see. Well I know there is a way to do a "default" config for X but frankly I never had to do because Nvidia works so well
2009-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	do a little googling about how to modify your xorg.conf file and maybe your can figure out how to comment out your new video driver.
2009-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	oenone1	dannyD1	can i still get the files on my desktop?
2009-06-20T06:04:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	yes. You should be able to .
2009-06-20T06:05:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	hold on let me test something because frankly I don't remember
2009-06-20T06:07:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	try doing a ctrl-alt-f1. That could get you to a linux prompt. Then you should be able to cp your files to a usb flash drive or something
2009-06-20T06:09:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	what the ctrl-alt-f1?
2009-06-20T06:10:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	cp {original file name and location} {new file name and location} ....what could be simpler
2009-06-20T06:14:00.000Z	oenone1	dannyD1	dont know whats the exact files name
2009-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	cp is a very powerful command with many wildcards. I am sure that you can figure it out. Google something like "unix command cp examples" and you should ge a lot of info
2009-06-20T06:16:00.000Z	dannyD1	oenone1	no problem
