2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	anir		hey guys where can i get linspire??
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	some companies make money off of putting together a very ease to use linux distribution. if you don't want to pay for them, that's ok.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	because people can't agree on a single one. if you want less choice, consider sticking to windows or better mac.
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	if you don't want to choose, there are options you can...erh...choose that are good for that state of mind.
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	you may have "standardization" in mind. i agree that standardization in the way of windows and mac os x is important and good. but you won't find many fans of that among unix people.
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	that is the problem with linux. if you don't like so much choice...there isn't much that can be done about it.
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	to have choice? yes, to have choice is good. however, in the java software development field there is often too much (dubious) choice, and it actually hurts people. what you should consider perhaps it to ignore everything that is not mainstream. that helps to cut away of lot of first level choices.
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	you seem to assume that all the linux distros out there are made for one particular group of users. that is however not so. if you are in a hurry, you don't have time to learn something new. so let a consultant tell you what you need or get what you already know. if you are unhappy with the stuff you already know...linux is in the box of options again.
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	then don't. don't buy the cat in the sack.
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	besides, who will help you with lindows? lindows is by far, far, far NOT linux mainstream.
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	in other words: you are about to get yourself a freak linux distro. i advise against that.
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	do you know anyone who uses it?
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	you can have someone remotely look over your shoulder, too, in case this is somehow not working out.
2005-01-02T12:09:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	i could google, but...
2005-01-02T12:09:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	i am too lazy.
2005-01-06T11:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	typically
2005-01-06T11:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	then you will have to manually get your linux install bootable somehow. you can use ntldr (windows' boot manager) to somehow do that, but basically, at that point...you have no access to your linux installation anymore, as far as i know.
2005-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	there is a dictating software shipping along with windows xp? never heard of that.
2005-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	besides, linux is not a 1:1 match for windows. if you think it is, reconsider.
2005-01-06T11:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	i am trying to help you adjust your expectations.
2005-01-06T11:39:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	office xp != xp (meaning windows xp)
2005-01-06T11:46:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	yes, ubuntu runs on amd 64 bit cpus, in 32 as well as 64 bit mode. you should ask about the common problems when using 64 bit mode though.
2005-01-06T11:48:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	you may have a hard time finding precompiled binaries of programs that you need. some people will tell you that compiling stuff yourself is easy. wether you believe them is up to you. :)
2005-01-06T13:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir	nevermind, just goofing around.
