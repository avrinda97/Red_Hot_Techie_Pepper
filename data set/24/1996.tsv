2009-05-27T09:12:00.000Z	juli4n		the command grub-reboot dont work on ubuntu 9.04
2009-05-27T09:13:00.000Z	juli4n		why?
2009-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	Do you have Default set to saved? ( Not sure if that's a requirement but it seems reasonable )
2009-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	yes i do
2009-05-27T09:15:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	i need reboot only one time with windwos
2009-05-27T09:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	What happens when you try to use grub-reboot? Does it give you an error or just not set the default?
2009-05-27T09:21:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	just set defaul
2009-05-27T09:22:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	do i need uncomment this line #savedefault=false??
2009-05-27T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	Where is that line, or rather could you pastebin your entire /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-05-27T09:24:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	this line is comment in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-27T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	But it matters where specifically because if could either be a comment or an option for update-grub depending on what line it's on. If you can please pastebin the entire file
2009-05-27T09:28:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/m3ebdfe16
2009-05-27T09:29:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	look the line 129
2009-05-27T09:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	You should not uncomment that ( it's actually not just a comment, it controls update-grub )
2009-05-27T09:33:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	my problem is: i need reeboot with windows one time but remotely, the next reboot i need the default options. the default options is ubuntu
2009-05-27T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	If you can't figure out how to get grub-reboot to work and you are desparate you could install an ext2 driver in windows and modify the /boot/grub/default manually ( which is warns against doing... )
2009-05-27T09:36:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	I dont like this options but it is the only way
2009-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	thankx for help me
2009-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	It might be made a little less dangerous if you use grub-set-default...
2009-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	wait before you go
2009-05-27T09:37:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	sorry my english is bad i speak spanish
2009-05-27T09:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	juli4n	It might be made a little less dangerous if you use grub-set-default to create a /boot/grub/default pointing to ubuntu, back that up, then use grub-set-default to create a default pointing to windows so that in windows you would just be swapping the file instead of editing it, but not knowing why there is a warning about editing it I am not sure if that really makes it any safer
2009-05-27T09:40:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	in windows i only modify the default option in /boot/grub/menu.lst but in ubuntu i will use grub-set-defaul and i will have a back up
2009-05-27T09:46:00.000Z	juli4n	Jordan_U	i going to ser default windwos and this file i will save in windwos partition, then when i am in windows i will reemplace it
