2007-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	bmt2		hello to all
2007-09-27T05:23:00.000Z	bmt2		i just did a apt-get install on gxine......when you execute gxine from a terminal it goes thru certain checks for setup.......but the video still doesn't play
2007-09-27T05:24:00.000Z	bmt2		when you close gxine and run it again..it goes thru the checks again, and still won't play the video
2007-09-27T05:24:00.000Z	bmt2		any thoughts anybody ?
2007-09-27T05:24:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	codecs?
2007-09-27T05:25:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	thanks
2007-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	it was .flv files that i was trying to play
2007-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	yeah ffmpeg and gst-* stuff should be in the links, I can play them here so it is possible
2007-09-27T05:26:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	huh ?
2007-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	the .flv files play okay in totem...cause the codec is on my system...so why doesn't gxine play the files ?
2007-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	packages you will need are named gst and ffmpeg with -something after it
2007-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	oh okay...do you i have to do apt-get to obtain these packages ?
2007-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	yeah, but if plays in totem, you have them ...
2007-09-27T05:30:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	so it is not the lack of codecs that the files will not play in gxine
2007-09-27T05:31:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	no
2007-09-27T05:33:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	lots, do you have beryl/compiz running?
2007-09-27T05:34:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	no i do not have beryl/compiz running only because when i turned on just the generic 'desktop effects' i couldn't get videos to play
2007-09-27T05:35:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	^
2007-09-27T05:35:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	i have a dual core laptop (1.6 ghz), with 2 gigs of RAM...do you think that is enough to run beryl or compiz ?
2007-09-27T05:35:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	I can see video when i resize the window, but it quickly disappears, I am blaming beryl for this ;)
2007-09-27T05:35:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	i am on t5500 with intel 945 and it is fine 1GB ram
2007-09-27T05:36:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	laptop also
2007-09-27T05:37:00.000Z	bmt2	bascule	is beryl and compiz the same or different ' desktop addiitons ' ?
2007-09-27T05:37:00.000Z	bascule	bmt2	they are different compiz-fusion is still going, beryl has stopped development
