2011-11-12T04:59:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	mplayer works fine?
2011-11-12T04:59:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	no - only VLC works fine
2011-11-12T05:01:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	check to see what video overlay you got in vlc and try the same it mplayer, totem doesnt let you change that as far as i know though
2011-11-12T05:01:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	although video is normal speed on mplayer, still no audio. VLC is the only player which is working 100% normal
2011-11-12T05:03:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	I don't know what video overlay is or where to find it in VLC. Totem was working 100% normal before I re-installed everything.
2011-11-12T05:04:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	hm, try installing mplayer from medibuntu.org repos
2011-11-12T05:06:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	medibuntu is already in my repos sources... ?? so does that mean mplayer I have now is from medibuntu repo?
2011-11-12T05:21:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	after you added medibuntu did you apt-get update && apt-get install mplayer?
2011-11-12T05:22:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	welcome back. Probably.. but I will do it again now.
2011-11-12T05:22:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	do you have graphic acceleration at all. what does glxinfo say?
2011-11-12T05:24:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	I don't have glxinfo installed but I do have graphic acceleration.
2011-11-12T05:25:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	can you apt-get install mesa-utils and pastebin glxinfo anyway?
2011-11-12T05:29:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	here you go - http://paste.ubuntu.com/735806/
2011-11-12T05:31:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	you got nvidia drivers?
2011-11-12T05:31:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	yes, the 3rd party nvidia drivers are installed and in use.
2011-11-12T05:32:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	it is a Quadro FX Go700 built into laptop MB if that makes any difference...
2011-11-12T05:32:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	how did you install them? from nvidia.com or from repos?
2011-11-12T05:32:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	Error: glXCreateContext failed doesnt look like its working properly
2011-11-12T05:34:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	from System > Administration > Additional Drivers (same as I have always done in the past with nvidia graphics cards)...
2011-11-12T05:36:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	I could try disabling 3rd party drivers for nvidia, then reinstall them... I have not tried that yet.
2011-11-12T05:36:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	if you're ok with command line i would suggest clean install from nvidia.com site
2011-11-12T05:38:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	I have done that in the past with my old laptop, but this one has always worked with the 3rd party drivers thing from the system menu....
2011-11-12T05:46:00.000Z	dalek_	dcherniv	oh yeah I just remembered another thing - before my mass re-install, I used to be able to set both the laptop LCD AND a TV set (through S-VHS port) to "Separate X Screen" - now I can only use "Twinview" or have one screen on and the other off. This could be related to my video playback problem somehow?
2011-11-12T05:47:00.000Z	dcherniv	dalek_	hard to tell.
