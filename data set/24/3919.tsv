2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	naxa		well, I've just recovered 2/3 lost partitions I've made with my previous attempt :)
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	naxa		now my install is almost fine
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	naxa		but i have some problems
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	naxa		1) the installer found two swaps, but I will delete one of the partitions
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	naxa		i dont know how can i disable the swap partition?
2007-09-04T13:50:00.000Z	naxa		2) i installed grub to the partition on which i installed the system. will it be ok? :)
2007-09-04T13:50:00.000Z	naxa		ok thank you :)
2007-09-04T13:51:00.000Z	naxa		3rd: my system won't boot this (/dev/sda3) partition, it will boot /dev/hda which doesn't have grub. can i install grub or lilo manually to that place?
2007-09-04T13:53:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	There's also the option to use SuperGrub.
2007-09-04T13:56:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	mc? Midnight Commander?
2007-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	sudo aptitude install mc
2007-09-04T13:59:00.000Z	naxa	MenZa	The problem is that there is no mc package...
2007-09-04T13:59:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install mc
2007-09-04T14:00:00.000Z	naxa	MenZa	OK Than what is this?
2007-09-04T14:01:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	Why have you enabled the root account?
2007-09-04T14:02:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	That's truly weird. Which version of Ubuntu do you use?
2007-09-04T14:02:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	cat /etc/issue
2007-09-04T14:03:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	ok. It's weird; I can install midnight commander fine.
2007-09-04T14:03:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	Why have you enabled your root accoutn?
2007-09-04T14:04:00.000Z	naxa	MenZa	I made it with sudo passwd root. I don't like if there is no root.
2007-09-04T14:04:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	Why?
2007-09-04T14:05:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	shouldn't be :)
2007-09-04T14:05:00.000Z	MenZa	naxa	Whether you use it or not; I was just curious.
