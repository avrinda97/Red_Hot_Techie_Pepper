2009-03-03T05:49:00.000Z	Shizuo		Ubuntu is the most racist distrib of all
2009-03-03T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	how so?
2009-03-03T05:50:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	It abuses the african heritage for some kind of cheap marketing emotional effect
2009-03-03T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	its just a word that means togetherness, thats not racist at all
2009-03-03T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	Nike is the greek godess of victory, is that racist against greeks too?
2009-03-03T05:51:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	It's different
2009-03-03T05:52:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	Because Ubuntu games on the public perception of blacks being in a bad position
2009-03-03T05:52:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	They would never choose a roman word, or a russian word
2009-03-03T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	how does it if the word used is "together" which is a positive word.
2009-03-03T05:53:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	They needed something "cutsy" such as a word borrowed from primitive tribes
2009-03-03T05:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	it just fit what they wanted to say, like when people look at the meaning of children names
2009-03-03T05:53:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	They wanted something weak and cute
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	A word connected to a minority
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	To make their distrib look like a social project
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	why would they want to name a product after something weak?
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	It's emotional blackmail
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	emotional blackmail to force people to use linux?
2009-03-03T05:54:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	Yes
2009-03-03T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	i can tell you've not used linux long. linux is a choice
2009-03-03T05:55:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	Like cutsy-fluffy black-people-loving cutsy OS
2009-03-03T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	there are many distributions
2009-03-03T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	take it up with canonical. I think yuo are misinterpretting the word 'racist'. Just like the people who want to not celebrate christmas so loudly as to not offend non-christians
2009-03-03T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Shizuo	if you have an issue with the name of ubuntu, we cannot change that and you should take it up with canonical directly. I'm sure they will inform yiou the same. This is also the ubuntu support channel for the OS itself, not qualms about its name
2009-03-03T06:22:00.000Z	Shizuo	ActionParsnip1	You should say butt
