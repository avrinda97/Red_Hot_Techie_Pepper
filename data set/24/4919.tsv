2006-12-11T13:53:00.000Z	jongt		kubuntu
2006-12-11T13:53:00.000Z	jongt		i think its something with update-rc.d
2006-12-11T13:53:00.000Z	jongt		yea its edgy
2006-12-11T13:54:00.000Z	jongt		o
2006-12-11T13:54:00.000Z	jongt		i used gentoo for a little
2006-12-11T13:54:00.000Z	jongt		s0 thats kind of my thinking
2006-12-11T13:55:00.000Z	jongt		eh
2006-12-11T13:56:00.000Z	jongt		i got this because i realized gentoo wasnt a great rookie distro
2006-12-11T13:56:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	did you use the 700MB install cd or the 60MB one?
2006-12-11T13:57:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	Because if you'd used the 60MB, you'd have figured it out much sooner.
2006-12-11T13:59:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	hold on, I'm just wondering why you need to install this, doesn't X self-configure with the 915?
2006-12-11T14:00:00.000Z	jongt	rastilin	it does but im actually on the 945 with resolution 1280x768 but the biggest res i can get currently is 1024x768
2006-12-11T14:01:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	So if I understand right, you have a 945 chip with 1280x768, but you can't select any resolution higher than 1024x768, and it shows up like a 915?
2006-12-11T14:03:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	It might be a problem with the x server's drivers. In any case you should check the configuration file "xorg.conf" and see what resolutions are configured.
2006-12-11T14:03:00.000Z	jongt	rastilin	what where you saying about the 60mb install
2006-12-11T14:04:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	the 60MB minimal disk only provides command line and a compiler. You're expected to partition your drive, download the stage files and unpack your system by hand. The 700MB livecd is only a recent addition, the minimal disk is how people used to install gentoo.
2006-12-11T14:05:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	Not to mention compiling the kernel, installing grub, configuring it by hand, etc...
2006-12-11T14:05:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	That's a common complaint, it seems to fail a lot.
2006-12-11T14:05:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	I used to use gentoo too, trust me, this is MUCH faster.
2006-12-11T14:06:00.000Z	jongt	rastilin	do you know where inittab is?
2006-12-11T14:06:00.000Z	jongt	rastilin	yea the package manager here is alot faster but gentoo is quick otherwise
2006-12-11T14:06:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	unless something fails to compile properly, then it's debugging time
2006-12-11T14:07:00.000Z	rastilin	jongt	or some libraries fail to link properly and you have to play "find the library".
2006-12-11T14:07:00.000Z	jongt	rastilin	yea gentoo was tough but i got everything working ok, then i tried to follow a howto without actually knowing what i was doing and broke gnome
