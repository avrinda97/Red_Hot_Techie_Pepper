2010-01-10T03:43:00.000Z	silare		Does anyone know where I could get WebKit 1.1.17 as a binary (.deb or download from Synaptic)?
2010-01-10T03:45:00.000Z	usser	silare	compile it, webkit doesnt have that many dependencies
2010-01-10T03:45:00.000Z	silare	usser	Where do I get the binary for WebKit 1.1.17? I know where to get 1.1.18 and 1.1.15 and the like, but I haven't had luck finding it.
2010-01-10T03:46:00.000Z	usser	silare	you can check out pretty much any version using svn
2010-01-10T03:47:00.000Z	usser	silare	besides why 1.1.17, midori will happily work with latest webkit
2010-01-10T03:47:00.000Z	silare	usser	1.1.18? According to the #midori devs, it's extremely buggy. I was on #midori earlier.
2010-01-10T03:47:00.000Z	usser	silare	oh i see. here http://trac.webkit.org/browser/releases/WebKitGTK/webkit-1.1.17
2010-01-10T03:48:00.000Z	silare	usser	This is the error I get as a result of 1.1.18: midori: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libwebkit-1.0.so.2: undefined symbol: soup_content_decoder_get_type
2010-01-10T03:48:00.000Z	usser	silare	thats the source though, so you'll have to compile
2010-01-10T03:48:00.000Z	usser	silare	did you install libsoup?
2010-01-10T03:48:00.000Z	usser	silare	and libsoup-dev
2010-01-10T03:48:00.000Z	usser	silare	those libs are a part of gtk if im not mistaken
2010-01-10T03:49:00.000Z	silare	usser	Yes, but I ended up compiling it since said error message above I think had to do with libsoup.
2010-01-10T03:49:00.000Z	silare	usser	Using git.
2010-01-10T03:50:00.000Z	usser	silare	yep when i was building it on debian squeze which had incomplete gtk, ie not completely up to date, i had to compile libsoup, but midori worked just fine with latest webkit the way i remember it
2010-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	usser	silare	make sure you configure all that midori related stuff with --prefix=/usr/local as not to cause conflict with libraries from package manager
2010-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	silare	usser	It worked with 1.1.18?
2010-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	usser	silare	yea i think so
2010-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	usser	silare	im not sure about the exact version but i was using latest trunk of webkit
2010-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	silare	usser	Hm... I'll try compiling libsoup and the like again. I git cloned webkit earlier myself.
2010-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	usser	silare	that was about two months ago, not sure if webkit was up to 1.1.18 back then
2010-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	silare	usser	Ahhh. That was 1.1.17u.
2010-01-10T03:53:00.000Z	usser	silare	oh. yea i dont want to go through the excercise of compiling midori again, otherwise i'd be of more help, i just use chromium now
2010-01-10T03:59:00.000Z	silare	usser	Yea... I lliked midori over chromium though, hence my trying to compile it. xD
