2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		hey guys
2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		i am at uni usin slackware
2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		on my laptop
2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		my uni uses a vpn to get on its network
2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		i heard ubuntu has tools for that
2005-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	PuGz		is that correct?
2005-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	PuGz		it would need mppe support in the kernel, and some kind of pptp client
2005-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	PuGz		and pptp support in ppp
2005-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	grr, trying to get PPTP support working in linux is such a pain
2005-08-31T10:34:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	so you just need mppe in kernel and openvpn software?
2005-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	huh, openvpn uses TLS for handshake and AES, Blowfish etc. for the cipher. MPPE is crap
2005-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	only use PPTP If you have to. It's inherently weak and insecure
2005-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	oh... so its completely separate from mppe and pptp? would it work with my uni vpn server?
2005-08-31T10:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	i tried getting the pptp client to work on debian + mandrake and i never had luck even after building MPPE support into the kernel
2005-08-31T10:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	no- why do you need the uni's vpn?
2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	to get on the net at uni
2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	you need VPN to get on the internet? that's stupid
2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	i am not trying to set up a vpn server... trying to connect to my uni's vpn server
2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	yes
2005-08-31T10:40:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	most likely
2005-08-31T10:40:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	ok
2005-08-31T10:40:00.000Z	PuGz	jasoncohen	is there  pptp stuff in ubuntu?
2005-08-31T10:41:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	pptp-linux is the client
2005-08-31T10:47:00.000Z	jasoncohen	PuGz	left?
