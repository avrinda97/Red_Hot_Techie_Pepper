2012-08-23T19:09:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh		I'm trying to host a webserver that requires SSL on a firewall I have and I've got a few questions about IP's.  Do I have to give my server 2 IP's?  My firewall uses SAT so I would have to have one address that is internal and one that is publicly available right?
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	Depends on where the webserver is going to be in your network. Is it going to be in the front of the line with the modem, or the in the back behind the firewall
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		Motec: It is processed every boot. I process my iptables rules that way on ym router.
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		motec: Because I dislike using ufw.
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	was planning behind it in the DMZ
2012-08-23T19:10:00.000Z	Sokel		Motec: Let me know how it goes :)
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	Alrighty. Good luck. I'll be here if you need me. You can pm me if needed.
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	I recommend doing specific rules.
2012-08-23T19:11:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	You might want to look into that first. DMZ is not the answer.
2012-08-23T19:12:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	I'm trying to get the machine firewalled
2012-08-23T19:13:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	I'd rather that than leave it open - naked to the Internet
2012-08-23T19:13:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	And why's that exactly
2012-08-23T19:14:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	Basic segementation is a rule that most security focused folks follow
2012-08-23T19:14:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	=)
2012-08-23T19:14:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	It's not hard to setup rules for specific ports and not leaving your server wide open. That's like saying I should disable selinux because a program can't access the required files.
2012-08-23T19:15:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	nope its not the same at all.  A firewall would add an additional layer of defense on the network.  Putting it outside ... weakens the security of your system
2012-08-23T19:15:00.000Z	Sokel		MoteC: Make sure you chmod +x on /etc/rc.local. It'll help you out.
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	Sokel	capitaninsaneoh	DMZ means it's wide open. Good on ya, Jim.
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	Doesn't in this case
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	that term is nebulous
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	Sokel		Yeah. Right. lol Keep telling yourself that.
2012-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	OK.  Thanks for your "help"
2012-08-23T19:18:00.000Z	Sokel		Hey, you're the one who wants a DMZ and thinks it's "secure" lol.
2012-08-23T19:18:00.000Z	capitaninsaneoh	Sokel	What is your point?  GO somewhere else if you want a debate
