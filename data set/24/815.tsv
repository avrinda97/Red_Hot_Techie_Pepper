2011-04-05T13:57:00.000Z	fisch246		Dang... I was hoping someone would know... Well I guess i'll find out in an hour or so...
2011-04-05T13:59:00.000Z	fisch246		i assume since GKSU won't start gparted will just halt after the current operation?
2011-04-05T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	how can it be doing an operation if it won't start
2011-04-05T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	what's the problem
2011-04-05T14:28:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	 gksu crashed and won't start up... i'm assuming because gparted is running... i'm wondering if it needs gksu to do operations...
2011-04-05T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	gksu crashed ? once you launch an application it's not running,
2011-04-05T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	how are you starting firefox ?
2011-04-05T14:31:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	alright i started it from terminal with this error... "device or resource busy"
2011-04-05T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	ok, why do you think that's a problem with gksu
2011-04-05T14:32:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	well soon as i saw that error i realized it wasn't gksu
2011-04-05T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	no idea what resources are busy, is your machine still doing the hard disk re-size
2011-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	yup
2011-04-05T14:38:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	well i feel much better about this now... if anything it won't finish the last operation and i'll just have to restart or something and do it then... thanks bro
2011-04-05T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	you fixed yourself, no problem
2011-04-05T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	what's the problem
2011-04-05T14:59:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	o nothing, just trying to remember that special partitioning that ubuntu server has... is it called LVM?
2011-04-05T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	lvm is logical volume managment, it's dynamic partitions made out of groups of disks
2011-04-05T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	arh won't teach him how to use / manage ubuntu
2011-04-05T15:05:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	o my bad, misunderstood what he wanted
2011-04-05T15:09:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	moment of truth with my gparted issue :3
2011-04-05T15:12:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	yup it crashed... sigh... time to restart then...
2011-04-05T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	fisch246	how annoying
2011-04-05T15:14:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	alright growing partition
2011-04-05T15:19:00.000Z	fisch246	ikonia	booting into resized partition... and... and... it froze >.< no problem though... just restart...
