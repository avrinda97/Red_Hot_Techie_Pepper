2009-11-14T05:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey		Where can I locate packages that I have downloaded, and installed. Can I burn them to a CD for use later if needed?
2009-11-14T05:48:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	/var/cache/apt/archives
2009-11-14T05:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	cool, what about part 2...I see, excellent! I'll try it!
2009-11-14T05:49:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	that's the "aptoncd" package, btw
2009-11-14T05:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	I am planning to (got that) reinstall this system. It is currently set up to dual boot, but the kernel is a bit bloated, so I want to streamline things a bit.
2009-11-14T05:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	I have no done an install from CD, will I get an oppertunity to customize the kernel on setup, or do I have to make install?
2009-11-14T05:53:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	that's ok, I'll look around for a description of the CD install option. Thanks! (aptoncd, that is!)
2009-11-14T05:54:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	sorry, was afk. Ubuntu doesn't have an option to customize the kernel during installation.
2009-11-14T05:55:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	really...I wanted to remove support for devices I dont have on my system. It seems that the kernel loads a lot of stuff on boot that I don't / need.
2009-11-14T05:56:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	really. I believe the thinking is that custom kernel compiling is somewhat outside of Ubuntu's scope.
2009-11-14T05:59:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	considering that most of the really unnecessary stuff is compiled as modules, rather than into the kernel, there really isn't much of a performance benefit from custom compiling one.
2010-02-20T13:51:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	yes
2010-02-20T13:53:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	I want to be able to clone voicemail system HDDs, I figure I can add a second drive, boot into live CD than go from there; does that sound about right?
2010-03-28T07:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	What's the advantage of that, bein' curious.
2010-03-28T07:55:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	There are plenty of applications for it. You can mount .iso files like they were actual devices (mount -o loop /path/to/file), or do something like Wubi where you have an entire Ubuntu partition inside a file on an NTFS partition...
2010-03-28T07:56:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	It would be cool to be able to mount an iso file!
2010-03-30T11:07:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	curious, what's wrong with network-manager?
2010-03-30T11:49:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	no, that's the alternate version. the server version has "server" where yours has "alternate"...
2010-03-30T11:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	I need server, but also software raid support. Read about it and asked here - alternate was suggested.
2010-03-30T11:51:00.000Z	rww	greezmunkey	the alternate CD and server CD use the same installer (and both support RAID). server uses a different kernel with various configuration changes optimized for servers, alternate uses the normal desktop kernel.
2010-03-30T11:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	dohhh, oh well - now I have both!
2010-05-09T16:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	now the bot takes plain english commands - nice!
2010-05-09T16:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	no doubt
2010-08-28T10:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	rww	I think China holds the mortgage on Atlantis as well...
