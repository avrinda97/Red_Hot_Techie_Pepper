2006-07-19T06:45:00.000Z	Rarj		im having a little trouble installing themes on my home computer
2006-07-19T06:45:00.000Z	Rarj		i have ubuntu dapper installed
2006-07-19T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	what problem are you having?
2006-07-19T06:45:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	gives me "invalid file format"
2006-07-19T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	that's a problem with the file structure inside
2006-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	ok. that comes up on all the themes that i try
2006-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	you can extract it yourself and see what it looks like inside.  Where are you getting the themes?
2006-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	gnome website
2006-07-19T06:48:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	im sorry,
2006-07-19T06:49:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	gnome-look.org
2006-07-19T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	yeah some of the themes up there aren't structured right, you can still use them, you just have to extract it yourself and then copy the right folder to ~/.themes/ .  I'll help you out with one so you can get the idea if you want, just link me
2006-07-19T06:51:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	my home computer doesnt have internet connection. im in office now..
2006-07-19T06:51:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	are you saying.. that i need to extract them to the usr/share/themes folder ?
2006-07-19T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	no, you should use ~/.themes/ == /home/username/.themes for your user
2006-07-19T06:52:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	oh ok
2006-07-19T06:53:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	can u tell me which window manager is loaded with ubuntu by default ?
2006-07-19T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	but, you should extract the file to your desktop and see what the structure looks like.  Usually the problem is they are save as something like /usr/share/themes/COOLTHEME/... but you only want COOLTHEME in your ~/.themes/
2006-07-19T06:53:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	metacity
2006-07-19T06:54:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	i extracted them, they have a folder inside with the theme name and a file called (themename).theme
2006-07-19T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	I believe the .theme should be inside the folder with the theme name, but let me go check
2006-07-19T06:55:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	ok
2006-07-19T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	Rarj	yes, the .theme should be in the directory.  Try moving it there, and then copying the directory to ~/.themes/ then go to system > preferences > themes and see if it works
2006-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	Rarj	jrib	ok great
