2008-07-25T00:32:00.000Z	tekchip		I'm trying to connect an Ubuntu 8.04 system to a public wireless system that uses a capture page with login to authenticate users. My Mac works fine as does every one elses winblows boxes. The Ubuntu system grabs an IP, DNS and Gateway address but will not bring up the capture/authentication page. I also can't ping anything but my own IP and the loopback. Any one care to take a stab?
2008-07-25T00:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	what do you mean "won't bring up the capture page"?
2008-07-25T00:34:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	Pretty standard sort of system. No security on the AP. Get an IP by DHCP and then you're first request for a web page redirects you to a page that prompts you for a login/pass etc. Pretty common at Panera, Starbucks and the like.
2008-07-25T00:35:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	so... what's stopping you from getting that login page?
2008-07-25T00:37:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	thus is my reason for a request for help. I have not the slightest. Everything looks great. No errors in dmesg, lshw or anything else I can see. But I can't ping the GW or any internet address. Only the addy the computer has and the loopback
2008-07-25T00:37:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	and the wireless works normall?
2008-07-25T00:37:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	and the wireless works normally?
2008-07-25T00:39:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	It appears to. It grabs addy and everything as it should. Everything under iwconfig looks good as does ifconfig
2008-07-25T00:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	I don't really have any ideas then.
2008-07-25T00:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	is the AP system just redirecting http? Perhaps ssh tunnel home and surf from there.
2008-07-25T00:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	wait, you can't get to *any* other hosts, right?
2008-07-25T00:41:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	great idea except home got packed away in a storage unit.  I'm in Iraq ATM. You are correct I cannot ping anything but the IP assigned to the machine and its loopback
2008-07-25T00:43:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	perhaps it's the AP being really restrictive about protocols, etc.
2008-07-25T00:43:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	maybe it has special rules concerning windows/mac and left out linux.
2008-07-25T00:44:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	why would that prevent the linux machine from connecting vs. my Mac or the rest of the winblows boxes?
2008-07-25T00:44:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	please stop your going to make me cry ;-)
2008-07-25T00:44:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	hehe
2008-07-25T00:44:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	A distinct possibility
2008-07-25T00:45:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	know of any way to check something like that short of going to ask the admin?
2008-07-25T00:45:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	no, sorry.
2008-07-25T00:46:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	all right well thank you for your help. I'll keep hacking at it till it either works or I have to go decipher the broken english of the admin.
2008-07-25T00:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	can't you just use one of those super-secret military "satellite-uplink" thingies with all the fancy graphics to get the internets anywhere? :P
2008-07-25T00:48:00.000Z	tekchip	DRebellion	how do you think I pulled down the copy of Ubuntu to begin with!? Unfortunately they don't let you actually play with the linux on the work side of things here. So alas I have to make it work with the Hajinets.
2008-07-25T00:49:00.000Z	DRebellion	tekchip	hehe, fair enough.
