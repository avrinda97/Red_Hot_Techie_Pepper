2009-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu		Hey guys
2009-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu		Gnight all
2009-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu		Having a slight problem at the moment. Other than the fact that I was just called a girl...(-__ -"). Whenever I play a .mov file in Movie Player, I get no sound
2009-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu		Im pretty sure sound should be there, can anyone issue a diagnosis?
2009-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	nothing wrong with rabbits
2009-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	which sound codec is it?
2009-03-08T07:46:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Its Quicktime
2009-03-08T07:47:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	that's a container
2009-03-08T07:47:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Oh...Well I suppose Im not sure how to answer that then :S
2009-03-08T07:48:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	that package depends on non-free things I don't like
2009-03-08T07:48:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	lol, Well what would you suggest?
2009-03-08T07:50:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	I don't know because I don't know what codecs are used
2009-03-08T07:50:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	hmm....
2009-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	How would I be able to find that out though? Referring to the type of codecs in the video
2009-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	indeed, that's the snag
2009-03-08T07:52:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	nothing in the media bit in nautilus's properties thingy
2009-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	I shall check
2009-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Aha! Apple Graphics (SMC)
2009-03-08T07:54:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	no wonder, they'll be no chance
2009-03-08T07:55:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Yikes
2009-03-08T07:55:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Any specific reason for that?
2009-03-08T07:56:00.000Z	bruce89	rabbit_ubuntu	I've never heard of that codec
2009-03-08T07:57:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	Ahh...Of course not. I have been royally rayped it would seem
2009-03-08T07:58:00.000Z	rabbit_ubuntu	bruce89	I'll try playing it in my virtual machine. See what happens there. Speaking of which, would you OR ANYONE know how to make a folder shared? SO I can access that folder from the vbox?
