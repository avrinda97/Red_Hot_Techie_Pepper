2011-04-15T18:25:00.000Z	unforgiven512		I am having an issue on boot, it hangs for approximately 145 seconds, at about 1.57 seconds in on my dmesg log. I think it pertains to ACPI and APIC issues. Here is a dmesg log of a boot, that hangs, with ACPI APIC enabled in my bios http://goo.gl/ioygb -- here is a dmesg log with ACPI APIC disabled in my BIOS, but without the hang: http://goo.gl/ecXLI
2011-04-15T18:26:00.000Z	unforgiven512		Disabling ACPI and/or APIC is hardly an ideal solution, to lose power management or reduce myself from 6 cores to 1 core available
2011-04-15T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	do you have latest BIOS?
2011-04-15T18:28:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	I've tried 2 different BIOS revisions, I'm attempting to contact ASUS as we speak, the previous livechat rep left mid-conversation
2011-04-15T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	the latest BIOS may have an APCP / APIC fix
2011-04-15T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	are there bugs logged for your kernel against the motherboard you have?
2011-04-15T18:29:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	Check on LaunchPad?
2011-04-15T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	indeed
2011-04-15T18:30:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	I'll take a look
2011-04-15T18:36:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	I've found http://goo.gl/ArwRq but it doesn't seem to be helpful. Should I append that bug, or file my own? It does (mostly) match the description
2011-04-15T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	you could log your own, if the admins determine it's a duplicate they willmark it as such. You can start the ball rolling with:   ubuntu-bug acpi
2011-04-15T18:37:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	Thanks :)
2011-04-15T18:41:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	Where would I file it? Here? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty
2011-04-15T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	sounds good to me :)
2011-04-15T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	natty isn't supported here
2011-04-15T18:46:00.000Z	unforgiven512	ActionParsnip	#ubuntu+1 correct?
2011-04-15T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	unforgiven512	yes
