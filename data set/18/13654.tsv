2005-10-24T16:49:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	some could be doing something nasty, or the server has been changed/reinstalled
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	electron__	rob^	so how do I get it working again?
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	you might have an old certificate for that ip address
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	adding it might help
2005-10-24T16:52:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	the server
2005-10-24T16:52:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	there is a command to do it also
2005-10-24T16:53:00.000Z	electron__	rob^	what is the command?
2005-10-24T16:54:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	gpg --import
2005-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	 you have to use the gpg command on the client box
2005-10-24T16:58:00.000Z	electron__	rob^	when I do the command, it just hangs there, doesn't finish
2005-10-24T16:59:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	you have to also give it a keyfile
2005-10-24T05:01:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	you could also do: gpg --trusted-key long key ID
2005-10-24T05:02:00.000Z	rob^	electron__	you have to give it the long key id from the server
