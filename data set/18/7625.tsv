2007-12-07T21:51:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ		Hello. Question from a newbie.  When I install software using the package manager...I never can find the software I installed...where exactly does it go after installation?
2007-12-07T21:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	many packages doesn't add a menu entry. just run them from Alt+f2 for example or a terminal
2007-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	Will running it from a terminal give me a graphical program?
2007-12-07T22:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	if you want to rip audio cd ubuntu comes with soundjuicer
2007-12-07T22:10:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	I just want to convert a .wav file into a .mp3
2007-12-07T22:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	use soundconverter then it has anice gui. you can install and use lame if you prefer (command line)
2007-12-07T22:20:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	It tells me I need the GStreamer lame plugin...
2007-12-07T22:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	install it then ;)
2007-12-07T22:21:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	Having trouble locating it.
2007-12-07T22:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	once you are at it install all the other gstreamer plugins
2007-12-07T22:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	probably you need to enable the multiverse repo
2007-12-07T22:21:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	How is that done..I am very new to this.
2007-12-07T22:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	go to System>Admin>Software Sources and check all the repos from the first tab
2007-12-07T22:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	also read the link ubotu told you
2007-12-07T22:28:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	I get an error. Dependacy is not satisfiable.
2007-12-07T22:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	ApacheBBQ	o_O when installing what? gstreamer lame?
2007-12-07T22:37:00.000Z	ApacheBBQ	erUSUL	Okay I got it working. Thank you for your help.
