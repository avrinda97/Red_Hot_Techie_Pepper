2008-12-23T00:17:00.000Z	amen51		hi, i have a question about grub
2008-12-23T00:18:00.000Z	amen51		i have used grub-update to update my menu.lst
2008-12-23T00:18:00.000Z	amen51		but grub does not seem to be using the file, is it possible that and older version is cached somewhere? and is being used
2008-12-23T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	how many versions of ubuntu or linux do you have installed on that machine
2008-12-23T00:19:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	there are many kernels
2008-12-23T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	how many versions of ubuntu or linux do you have on that machine
2008-12-23T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	are you using a shared /boot partition
2008-12-23T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	stop asnwering questions I'm not asking
2008-12-23T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	thats the problem then
2008-12-23T00:20:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	what is the problem
2008-12-23T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	grub is reading the menu.lst from your other /boot partition, this is what happens if you don't set multi-boot up and just blindly install operating systems next to each other
2008-12-23T00:21:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	it used be woking
2008-12-23T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	so ?
2008-12-23T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	it's not now
2008-12-23T00:22:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	ok what do you suggest
2008-12-23T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	amen51	using a shared /boot partition so only one grub version is installed
2008-12-23T00:24:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	is there a guide somewhere which i can use to avoid messing up my system
2008-12-23T00:25:00.000Z	amen51	ikonia	thanks anyways
