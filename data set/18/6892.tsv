2008-11-15T01:37:00.000Z	sap1		hi.i have installed realplayer 11 in intrepid but everytime i try to play a .rmvb movie in it it crashes anyone has any ideas
2008-11-15T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	try running it from a terminal and see if there are any error messages
2008-11-15T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	open a terminal, applications, accessories, terminal.. then run the player from there
2008-11-15T01:40:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	the player opens the problem happens when i open a .rmvb file wih the player it just closes
2008-11-15T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	how do you start the player?
2008-11-15T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	where is "realplay" located? you can check using "which realplay"
2008-11-15T01:44:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	sorry dint understand which realplay
2008-11-15T01:44:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	isnt there only one
2008-11-15T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	just type "which realplay" without the quotes in the terminal, "which" is a command
2008-11-15T01:46:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	/usr/bin/realplay
2008-11-15T01:46:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	thats the output i get
2008-11-15T01:46:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	ok.. what happens if you just start the realplayer from the terminal, just type "realplay" in the terminal
2008-11-15T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	then do the thing that crashes it and take a look in the terminal.. do you get any text there? errors?
2008-11-15T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	don't paste stuff here, use the pastebin
2008-11-15T01:50:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	(realplay.bin:3268): Pango-CRITICAL **: pango_layout_set_text: assertion `layout != NULL' failed  (realplay.bin:3268): Pango-CRITICAL **: pango_layout_get_pixel_extents: assertion `PANGO_IS_LAYOUT (layout)' failed Opening ALSA PCM device default /usr/bin/realplay: line 57:  3268 Floating point exception$HELIX_LIBS/realplay.bin "$@"
2008-11-15T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	ok, see that last line, "floating point exception".. that means something went very wrong with the program and it had to shut down
2008-11-15T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	sap1	not a lot you can do about that.. wait for the realplayer people to release a new version
2008-11-15T01:52:00.000Z	sap1	Slart	: ok thanks
