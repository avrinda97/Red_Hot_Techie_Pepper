2007-10-12T08:09:00.000Z	ironcladlou		anybody? this should be a trivial task. i've tried both a regular application launch and an application in terminal launcher, neither work
2007-10-12T08:10:00.000Z	`Matir	ironcladlou	what's the problem?
2007-10-12T08:10:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	I am just trying to figure out how to launch a shell script from an app launcher in gnome
2007-10-12T08:11:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	i've tried launchers, using "sh <path to script>", gnome-terminal -e, nothing works (i'm trying to launch my java IDE, intellij IDEA)
2007-10-12T08:11:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	just executing it from a term works fine
2007-10-12T08:12:00.000Z	`Matir	ironcladlou	does just NOTHING happen?  if so, what is placed in .xsession-errors?
2007-10-12T08:13:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	if i configure the launch as a terminal launcher, i see some window pop up and disappear immediately
2007-10-12T08:13:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	.xsession-errors is empty
2007-10-12T08:14:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	if i configure the launch as an "Application", nothing happens when i click the icon (other than the animation for opening an app)
2007-10-12T08:14:00.000Z	`Matir	ironcladlou	what happens if you run "gnome-terminal -e SCRIPTNAME" from a console?
2007-10-12T08:14:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	and again, nothing in .xsession-errors
2007-10-12T08:14:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	i'll try that
2007-10-12T08:15:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	the same thing that happens if i run it from the alt+f2 run dialog: a terminal window with a modal error stating "there was an error craeting the child process for this terminal"
2007-10-12T08:17:00.000Z	`Matir	ironcladlou	can you put the output of "mount" in a pastebin, please
2007-10-12T08:17:00.000Z	ironcladlou	`Matir	one moment

2007-10-12T08:19:00.000Z	`Matir	ironcladlou	odd... that error is usually from a lack of a proper /dev filesystem... what are permissions on /dev/null?
