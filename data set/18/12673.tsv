2009-02-01T05:42:00.000Z	cecilia_		hi... i'm troubled with monitor resolution setting... someone please help
2009-02-01T05:44:00.000Z	cecilia_		i bought a monitor that demands 1440x900, and with the hints and instructions from the forums, i made the situation worse...
2009-02-01T05:44:00.000Z	cecilia_		my former resolution was 1024x728
2009-02-01T05:45:00.000Z	cecilia_		hi, the cube... i'm from Rio, Brazil
2009-02-01T05:45:00.000Z	cecilia_		yep
2009-02-01T05:45:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	you try a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  ?
2009-02-01T05:46:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	did it ask you for your resolution?
2009-02-01T05:47:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	can you pastebin your xorg.conf file?  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  <--
2009-02-01T05:47:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	this is an lcd right?
2009-02-01T05:48:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	did you try the advanced option in the reconfigure?
2009-02-01T05:50:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	basically the command i typed above gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf will open your xorg file with a text editor then you can copy and paste this to the pastebin site:http://paste.ubuntu.com  and give us the url so we can view the file
2009-02-01T05:53:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	make sure of the command. if you change the case X11 to x11 it wont open the right file
2009-02-01T06:00:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	i might have to leave at any time so here is prob best.  can you pastebin also lspci -v > /home/$USER/file.txt   this will create a file.txt that you can open in an editor.
2009-02-01T06:04:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	no problem nothing should happen. what that did was redirect the output of the lspci to a file so now do the command: gedit /home/$USER/file.txt  and pastebin that file
2009-02-01T06:07:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	what resolution did you want again?
2009-02-01T06:08:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	what does the command sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx   say?
2009-02-01T06:11:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-96 then hit alt-ctrl-backspace  <-- note that this will reset X so youll lose any open apps
2009-02-01T06:12:00.000Z	pike_	cecilia_	dont restart x if it says already installed only if it installs it
