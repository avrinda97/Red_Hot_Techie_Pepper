2011-05-24T22:22:00.000Z	skynet_user		Hi all - I've a hardy box with intermittent network connection problems.  I changed the nic, cable, switchport but no luck.  No disconnection reported in dmesg. Any ideas?
2011-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	skynet_user		I even went as far as changing the nic type...
2011-05-24T22:25:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	what are the symptoms of the intermittent failure?
2011-05-24T22:26:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	also, is the problem recent?
2011-05-24T22:27:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	I can ping the box fine from the same lan.  Then randomly like every 10-30s it just drops.  The box was installed yesterday by a vendor for a 3rd party app.  When it drops the box itself can't ping anything
2011-05-24T22:27:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	however the cisco switch interface never goes down
2011-05-24T22:28:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	how long is the interruption?
2011-05-24T22:28:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	again random between 10-60s
2011-05-24T22:29:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	any interesting log entries from the problem machine during an episode?
2011-05-24T22:30:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	No -  dmesg, messages, kern.log not showing anything interesting
2011-05-24T22:30:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	and the interface remains configured during the episode, but can't even ping itself?
2011-05-24T22:30:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	does ifconfig report a great deal of dropped packets?
2011-05-24T22:31:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	also, could there be an ip address collision on the network?
2011-05-24T22:32:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	ifconfig shows no errors.  No ip collision as I've used different IPs just in case.  Also checked arp on my switches - no issues
2011-05-24T22:33:00.000Z	sipior	skynet_user	bizarre. default MTU?
2011-05-24T22:33:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	default at 1500
2011-05-24T22:34:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	on a whim going to boot to earlier kernel...
2011-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	skynet_user	sipior	no joy same in previous kernel.  Stumped
