2007-05-11T08:47:00.000Z	DocShay		Also having a weird boot problem. I have 3 HD's. 1 windows. 1 spare (installed ubuntu on it) 1 with media. Whenever I boot up my PC it goes straight into windows with no option of going into linux...only way I can get here is booting thru CD, then choosing boot from harddrive. How do I fix it so I dont need a CD to boot into it?
2007-05-11T08:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	Did you install windows after Linux?
2007-05-11T08:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	Did it ever work?
2007-05-11T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	Do you have more than one drive?
2007-05-11T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	Set the Bios to boot from the HD that has grub installed.
2007-05-11T08:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	You need to install GRUB to the Drive with windows on it then ( this won't touch windows itself, just the MBR )
2007-05-11T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	GRUB is just a bootloader ( You can also install it to a floppy if you have a floppy drive )
2007-05-11T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	Yes.
2007-05-11T08:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DocShay	You can also just phisically connect the Ubuntu drive where the Windows drive is
