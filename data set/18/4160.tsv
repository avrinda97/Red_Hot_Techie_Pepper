2009-07-02T03:17:00.000Z	rsr	Gnea	I did
2009-07-02T03:17:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	oh, about gnash?
2009-07-02T03:17:00.000Z	rsr		yes
2009-07-02T03:18:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	i just install flashplugin-nonfree and be done with it, i don't even bother with the others. no problems that way.
2009-07-02T03:18:00.000Z	rsr		can I switch between the two plugins? disable one momentarily
2009-07-02T03:18:00.000Z	Gnea		why?
2009-07-02T03:18:00.000Z	Gnea		I mean, why not just stick with one that works?
2009-07-02T03:18:00.000Z	rsr	Gnea	Im a developer and I likegetting involved
2009-07-02T03:19:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	good reason. :)
2009-07-02T03:19:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	I don't see why not... just create 2 profiles and disable one in one and the other in the other and switch between those?
2009-07-02T03:20:00.000Z	rsr	Gnea	how do I disable one in firefox
2009-07-02T03:20:00.000Z	rsr	Gnea	I can only imagine system wide
2009-07-02T03:20:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	firefox --help  will tell you how to bring up the profile selector
2009-07-02T03:22:00.000Z	rsr	Gnea	I just removed gnash
2009-07-02T03:23:00.000Z	rsr		was a bit faster
2009-07-02T03:23:00.000Z	rsr		in the end you were right, since I have the package ill install it later
2009-07-02T03:24:00.000Z	Gnea	rsr	well, I recommended separate profiles instead of separate accounts, that way you could see how the browser reacts without much fanfare - plus you can just link stuff on the commandline in the profile directories - but it's just a suggestion :)
