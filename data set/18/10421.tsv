2007-01-06T15:03:00.000Z	archie		hope u understand me
2007-01-06T15:04:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	once it's formatted as ext3 you can mount it on the 'main system'. Open a console and enter 'man mount' and 'man fstab' for more details
2007-01-06T15:04:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	basically, you create a directory to use as a mountpoint, then add an entry in /etc/fstab so that it's mounted automatically
2007-01-06T15:08:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	not if you edit /etc/fstab and add a line to mount the partition automatically. Then it will be available for all regular users
2007-01-07T06:11:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	Do you mean you want to see where all drives are mounted?
2007-01-07T06:11:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	you won't see it until you mount it
2007-01-07T06:14:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	It won't have a path until you mount it. It will have a device name in /dev - possibly something like /dev/hdc
2007-01-07T06:16:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	You must have put it on a controller, oryou couldn't format it
2007-01-07T06:17:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	If it's the master on IDE channel 1, it will be hda, the slave on channel 1 is hdb, the master on IDE channel 2 is hdc and the slave on channel 2 is hdd
2007-01-07T06:17:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	If you haveone disk, it's called hda if it's an IDE disk, and sda if it's SCSI
2007-01-07T06:18:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	fdisk -l (that's a lower-case L)
2007-01-07T06:19:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	try it as root: sudo fdisk -l
2007-01-07T06:21:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	what do you mean 'blocks'?
2007-01-07T06:22:00.000Z	BackPacker	archie	what does it say immediately under 'Device'?
