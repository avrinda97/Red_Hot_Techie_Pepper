2010-12-30T09:29:00.000Z	deeeed		I am trying to mount an hfsplus hd as rw but it doesn't work
2010-12-30T09:29:00.000Z	deeeed		it's always mounted as read-only
2010-12-30T09:29:00.000Z	deeeed		mount -t hfsplus -o rw,force /dev/sdb1 SAMSUNG/
2010-12-30T09:29:00.000Z	deeeed		any idea why ?
2010-12-30T09:30:00.000Z	knoppies	deeeed	try using sudo??
2010-12-30T09:30:00.000Z	deeeed	knoppies	I do this as root...
2010-12-30T09:31:00.000Z	knoppies	deeeed	Im not sure, let me man mount.
2010-12-30T09:32:00.000Z	knoppies	deeeed	if you try using the switch -w?
2010-12-30T09:32:00.000Z	deeeed		same
2010-12-30T09:33:00.000Z	knoppies	deeeed	Im not sure. Maybe it has something to do with permissions, like the directory tree structure has someone else set as its owner and you only have read-only permissions??
2010-12-30T09:34:00.000Z	deeeed		I tried to changed the permissions etc... and mI am running as root
2010-12-30T09:34:00.000Z	deeeed		root@seyan:/media# mount -t hfsplus -o rw,user,auto,uhelper=udisks,uid=1000,force /dev/sdb1 SAMSUNG/
2010-12-30T09:34:00.000Z	deeeed		root@seyan:/media# chmod +w SAMSUNG/
2010-12-30T09:34:00.000Z	deeeed		chmod: changing permissions of `SAMSUNG/': Read-only file system
2010-12-30T09:34:00.000Z	deeeed		it just doesn't take the rw
2010-12-30T09:36:00.000Z	knoppies	deeeed	is it maybe a flash card with a 'read only' switch on it?
2010-12-30T09:36:00.000Z	deeeed	knoppies	it's not
