2009-02-13T04:40:00.000Z	CokeNCode		hey, guys, I'm looking for some virus protection software for linux
2009-02-13T04:40:00.000Z	CokeNCode		any suggestions
2009-02-13T04:40:00.000Z	CokeNCode		preferably something that i can apt-get install
2009-02-13T04:40:00.000Z	CokeNCode		thanks Rolanditu\Afk
2009-02-13T04:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		hmmm, I actually want to scan some files on my website
2009-02-13T04:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		it's infected :(
2009-02-13T04:42:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	call me paranoid, but there is no un-rooting of a compromised machine.  same goes for viruses.
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	dude... you can't get a virus on linux.  if you suspect you hvave an infected file, delete it.
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode	klasikahl	I'm talking about a server
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	so what?
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	you don't have `rm` on your server?
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	rootkits != viruses
2009-02-13T04:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode	klasikahl	do you do any hosting? you never get full access to the server
2009-02-13T04:44:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	you pay for a server that you can't delete files from?
2009-02-13T04:44:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	ftp?
2009-02-13T04:44:00.000Z	CokeNCode	klasikahl	listen carefully
2009-02-13T04:46:00.000Z	CokeNCode	klasikahl	don't blame me :/
2009-02-13T04:47:00.000Z	klasikahl	CokeNCode	wait, let's start with your premise.  what makes you think this linux box is compromised?
