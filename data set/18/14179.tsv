2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	You need to enable the PHP module.
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	That's for you.
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	sorry didnt get that....?
2005-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	sudo a2enmod php4
2005-12-28T14:55:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/207
2005-12-28T14:55:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	says that module does not exist...?
2005-12-28T14:55:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	See the debian-administration URL
2005-12-28T14:59:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	sorry, dont really get it - where do I get the modules from? running a2enmod gives me "This module does not exist!"
2005-12-28T14:59:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	apt-get install libapache2-php4
2005-12-28T15:00:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	ah, well, that package does not exist, apt says....running breezy, just installed it
2005-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	think I found it - but: is there a problem running php5 instead of php4?
2005-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	I have no experience with PHP5.
2005-12-28T15:12:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	still got problems.....a2enmod php4 now says "already enabled" but still phpmyadmin wont show....got any more advice?
2005-12-28T15:13:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	Did you restart Apache2 yet?
2005-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	yes, twice
2005-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	paulproteus|lapt	hume	Hmm.
2005-12-28T15:18:00.000Z	hume	paulproteus|lapt	what i've done is to run the asenmod php4 and then restart apache2 and restart my browser -- is there any other setting or package to deal with?
