2008-12-18T22:30:00.000Z	white-sheep		Could somebody tell me how to compile / install / make / etc?  I have gfortune-1.0.2 that I'd like to compile.  It's a GUI for fortune.
2008-12-18T22:31:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	have installed build-essentials
2008-12-18T22:31:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	have you installed build-essentials (or build-essential, not sure)? it is necessary
2008-12-18T22:32:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	I'm doing it right now.
2008-12-18T22:32:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	Done.
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	-- Where do I go from there?  Apparently it's used to build deb packages.
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	ok, after that.. read the readme contained within the tar file... (first extract the tar file)... it would tell you do something like: sudo configure ; sudo make ; sudo make install...
2008-12-18T22:36:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	It don't work.  There are few commands and I tried them.  No luck.
2008-12-18T22:37:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	did you follow the steps contained in the readme files WORD FOR WORD with NO deviation?
2008-12-18T22:37:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	-- Yes.  I copied the commands and paste them in the terminal.  It was INSTALL.sh script.
2008-12-18T22:38:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	ok, what errors did you receive?
2008-12-18T22:39:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	-- No target specified and no makefile found.  Stop.  No rule to make target 'install'.  Stop.
2008-12-18T22:39:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	-- Can you install this and confirm for me?  I think gFortune-1.0.2 may be borked.
2008-12-18T22:40:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	use cp /home/white-sheep/gfortune-whatever and follow the readme to the letter
2008-12-18T22:42:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	3 possibilities: you didn't follow the readme/ you weren't in the folder you extracted/ you didn't have the correct packages (unlikely -becuase it would have givven much different errors/ lastly problem with file or app .... ok thats 4
2008-12-18T22:44:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	-- There are nothing in README.  Just bunch of legal and descriptions -- No instruction.  However, I looked at Install.  Now, that *was* a script.  I ran it.  It didn't work.  I'm looking for older version to resort back to.  Yes, I opened the terminal from that window.
2008-12-18T22:45:00.000Z	wiehan	white-sheep	& vesayth: I don;t know then
2008-12-18T22:46:00.000Z	white-sheep	wiehan	Alright -- Thank.
