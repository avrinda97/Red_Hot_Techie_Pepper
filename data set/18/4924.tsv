2010-05-23T20:38:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	is this in lucid?
2010-05-23T20:38:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	yes, was also there in 9.10
2010-05-23T20:39:00.000Z	gps23		happens approx once every 10 times i boot my system
2010-05-23T20:39:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	what kind of keyboard?  (sorry I missed first part of convo)
2010-05-23T20:40:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	its PS2
2010-05-23T20:40:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	Logitech
2010-05-23T20:41:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	does it always happen with that keyboard or do you have another ps2 kb to try?
2010-05-23T20:42:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	i only have this keyboard, also as it doesn't happen everytime, i could borrow a KB to check on the spot
2010-05-23T20:42:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	i mean couldn't*
2010-05-23T20:43:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	I'm guessing its either the ps/2 port itself or the kb cord/plug
2010-05-23T20:44:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	may be, i thinking i will have to use XP for few days to test this :(
2010-05-23T20:44:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	does the mouse allow you to click on the accessibility options on the login screen?
2010-05-23T20:44:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	mouse works, i didn't tried to click on accessibility button but clicked session button to shutdown system
2010-05-23T20:44:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	you can bring up an onscreen keyboard
2010-05-23T20:45:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	if its called session button
2010-05-23T20:45:00.000Z	gps23	mdg2	but then i will be stuck with gnome desktop without KB
2010-05-23T20:46:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	you could trouble shoot if the keyboard is seen via a virtual terminal so you can see if you need to scrounge up another keyboard
2010-05-23T20:47:00.000Z	mdg2	gps23	I mean terminal from the desktop
