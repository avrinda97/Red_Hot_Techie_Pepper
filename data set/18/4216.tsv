2011-05-15T15:51:00.000Z	malik		hi all,
2011-05-15T15:52:00.000Z	malik		how to use inotify in linux environment with kernels older then 2.6.9  without using keernel patches?
2011-05-15T15:53:00.000Z	ChrisTX	malik	you cant
2011-05-15T15:54:00.000Z	ChrisTX		if feature X is not in your kernel, you cant use it
2011-05-15T15:54:00.000Z	ChrisTX		pretty obvious
2011-05-15T15:55:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	Cant this be achieved by running a separate daemon which is programmed using inotify libraries,
2011-05-15T15:56:00.000Z	ChrisTX	malik	inotify is a syscall, how would that work?
2011-05-15T15:56:00.000Z	ChrisTX		you can use dnotify though
2011-05-15T15:57:00.000Z	ChrisTX		also, who uses kernels older than 2.6.9 ? you're on RHEL 3 or what?
2011-05-15T15:59:00.000Z	malik		Ok, I am not much versed with inotify too,what  I want to do is to write a daemon, which keeps any eye on certain log files and as soon as there is a new entry at the end of log file i want to send it to a web service. Can you guide me how can i do it otherwise?
2011-05-15T15:59:00.000Z	ChrisTX	malik	you can use the older dnotify
2011-05-15T16:01:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	am i on the right track if you see me objective in my last msg ?
2011-05-15T16:02:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	i have to log all the activitiy into a database.
2011-05-15T16:02:00.000Z	ChrisTX	malik	inotify replaced dnotify because inotify is more finegrained, but dnotify would perfectly work for what you need
2011-05-15T16:03:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	thanks, i just look for dnotify.
2011-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	I just looked up dnotify, I found a couple of C program examples using dnotify where it is used only to monitor directories. Does it also work for file based events ?
2011-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	ChrisTX	malik	no that's why inotify was introduced. but that wasn't my point, I assumed that if there is a change in the directory (thus dnotify can be used), then you could check for changes in the log
2011-05-15T16:22:00.000Z	malik	ChrisTX	yes i also thought of the same to look for directory events and then check my required files, i found something name FAM as well, just reading the intro, Do you know FAM if it can be useful in my situation?
