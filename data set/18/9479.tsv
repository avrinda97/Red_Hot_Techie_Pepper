2007-05-26T15:32:00.000Z	portofu	ROnewbie	just state your problem w/ wifi
2007-05-26T15:44:00.000Z	ROnewbie	portofu	hi portofu. Here it is: Net Mngr dosn't connect to my WEP-encrypted wireless network; it sees it, it asks for the key when I click it, but it takes several minutes until it says "unable to connect" on a mouseover. It also displays zero signal strength for all WLANs, both mine and those of my neighbors. I'm running Feisty on an MSI S271X laptop, with a RaLink RT2561/RT61 rev B 802.11g wireless card and a DLink router.
2007-05-26T15:46:00.000Z	portofu	ROnewbie	have you try to turn off WEP/WPA on your router and connect to it?
2007-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	ROnewbie	portofu	would that make a lot of difference ? and if it would work, what would it say about my chances to use encrypted networks ?
2007-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	portofu	ROnewbie	when you debug a problem you always try to get rid of layers first
2007-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	ROnewbie	portofu	OK, I'll try that now. Be back in a sec
2007-05-27T16:05:00.000Z	ROnewbie	portofu	sorry, i was disconnected, i didn't get any message after i sent you the wi-fi card number
