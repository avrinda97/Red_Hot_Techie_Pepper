2008-02-27T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 i belive -Y is faster but less secure. used on local/trusted lans.. (or so i recall in some ssh docs)
2008-02-27T06:17:00.000Z	komputes	Dr_willis_	Bossmanbeta  More or less ?
2008-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 when in doubt - read the ssh docs i guess. :)
2008-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	komputes	Dr_willis_	you've seen the size of that monster
2008-02-27T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	   -Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.       -X      Enables X11 forwarding.
2008-02-27T06:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 from the MAN page.. seemns -Y is more secure
2008-02-27T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 i got confused it said that -x disabled  forwarding.. -X enables it.. :) hard to tell the diff  from x and X in my console font..
2008-02-27T06:21:00.000Z	komputes	Dr_willis_	I have, RTM but I've stated before that I have this condition called manualitis, where large manuals make me his my head on my keyboard
2008-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 the locate database has a setting file that dictates  what filesystems it scans.
2008-02-27T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 thats normally a feature of the vnc CLIENT - from what ive seen. some can doit. some cant

2008-02-27T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 i only use vnc under windows to get to the vncserver on the linux box. using the vnc4server on linux.
2008-03-07T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 many support a 'whatever --replace' option, or depending on how it got launched, you can kill it from a terminal, and run another.
2008-03-07T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	komputes	 ive seen some that come with menu items to launch alternative window managers.. depends on your needs.
