2010-01-26T23:51:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	stop repeating continuously, someone will eventually see your question
2010-01-26T23:59:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	I don't know why Firefox won't restore your session.  is it possible that your system erased the session information?
2010-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	you tried a hard reboot?  (manual power off and turn back on)?
2010-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	define black screen.  as in no desktop interface?
2010-01-27T00:03:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	i can't connect to your system, unfortunately, thats not how IRC works
2010-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	but you have access to the desktop interface (i.e. the task bar, your desktop with icons on it, etc)?
2010-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	you tried a repair install of firefox?  it seems like a glitch in the program itself
2010-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	hold on a sec...
2010-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	open a terminal, and type this command: sudo apt-get install --reinstall firefox
2010-01-27T00:11:00.000Z	m4j	Trek	whqat to do now
2010-01-27T00:11:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	did it ask for a password and go through a reinstallation process?
2010-01-27T00:11:00.000Z	m4j	Trek	what to do now
2010-01-27T00:12:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	if it worked, you should be able to close firefox and reopen it and not have the issue (assuming it was a bug in the install)
2010-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	Trek	m4j	then i don't know what the issue is, unfortunately
