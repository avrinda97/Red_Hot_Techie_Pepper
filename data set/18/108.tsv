2012-09-08T09:14:00.000Z	Adie_		yeah, that would 100% help
2012-09-08T09:15:00.000Z	Adie_		but I don't wana D:
2012-09-08T09:15:00.000Z	Adie_		I didn't install 12.04
2012-09-08T09:15:00.000Z	Adie_		I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10
2012-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	Adie_		:<
2012-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	Adie_		all I did was update-manager -d
2012-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	Adie_		and click yes
2012-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	Adie_		><
2012-09-08T09:18:00.000Z	Adie_		how do I open the terminal?
2012-09-08T09:19:00.000Z	Adie_		I don't know how to open the terminal :x
2012-09-08T09:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	Adie_	same way you did before you ran that command
2012-09-08T09:21:00.000Z	Adie_	IdleOne	sorry: I don't have a GUI

2012-09-08T09:21:00.000Z	Adie_		updating to 12.10 broke it
2012-09-08T09:21:00.000Z	Adie_		well, I mean... no window manager
2012-09-08T09:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	Adie_	but if you really don't know how to get to a terminal I suggest you do a clean install of 12.04
2012-09-08T09:21:00.000Z	Adie_		do YOU know how to get to the terminal from this?
2012-09-08T09:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	Adie_	ctrl-alt-F1, F7 will take you back to gui. more support in #ubuntu+1 since you're running 12.10
