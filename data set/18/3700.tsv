2012-02-09T13:19:00.000Z	OpenSesame		I need help
2012-02-09T13:20:00.000Z	OpenSesame		I'm trying to install Ubuntu right now along Windows 7 with a disk. But it doesn't detect any operating systems
2012-02-09T13:20:00.000Z	OpenSesame		Well I don't need because I also just fresh installed W7
2012-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	OpenSesame		I'm using another computer right now
2012-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	OpenSesame		Trying to dualboot on my laptop
2012-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	OpenSesame		Well I partitioned my hard drive into two. 250 GB each.
2012-02-09T13:22:00.000Z	OpenSesame		So there is one that is not allocated at the moment
2012-02-09T13:22:00.000Z	OpenSesame		But still somehow Ubuntu doesn't detect any OS
2012-02-09T13:22:00.000Z	OpenSesame		Sure, anything that works
2012-02-09T13:22:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	did you install it already?
2012-02-09T13:24:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	and then you'll install ubuntu onto the empty 250GB partition
2012-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	you must have some strange hard drive set up
2012-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	in the ubuntu installer, just use the manual partitioning and set ubuntu to use half the drive, would save the step of shrinking
2012-02-09T13:37:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	why not?
2012-02-09T13:38:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	what screen are you at right now
2012-02-09T13:39:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	you need to create the partitions on the drive, at minimum a root partition (/) and a swap partition
2012-02-09T13:40:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	i'm not sure, I can't see what you're on
2012-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	Ben64	OpenSesame	anyway, what screen are you on right now?
