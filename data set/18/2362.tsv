2010-06-07T01:54:00.000Z	FlameTai1		I'm running into an odd problem with sound, Amarok will play, for awhile FireFox didn't want to output sounds on Youtube I got the firefox sounds working by exiting amarok then reentering, but I still currently here no system sounds anyone have a suggestion?
2010-06-07T01:54:00.000Z	kermit	FlameTai1	actually someone said dist-upgrade, i'm doing that
2010-06-07T01:55:00.000Z	FlameTai1	kermit	dist0upgrade would make more sense.
2010-06-07T01:55:00.000Z	kermit	FlameTai1	i did apt-get, somenoe said to use aptitude, but apt-get is already going.. so i'll leave it, i dont think it matters?
2010-06-07T01:55:00.000Z	FlameTai1	kermit	It shouldn't as long as you used sudo
2010-06-07T01:56:00.000Z	FlameTai1	kermit	I use Apt-get all the time.
