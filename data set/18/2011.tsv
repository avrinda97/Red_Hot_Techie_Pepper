2010-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	nicole		hey folks
2010-10-24T01:41:00.000Z	nicole		was trying out 10.10
2010-10-24T01:42:00.000Z	nicole		but when I added a new user the theming has changed
2010-10-24T01:42:00.000Z	nicole		looks a bit antiquated and will not change theme at all
2010-10-24T01:42:00.000Z	nicole		does it require a reboot after adding a new user
2010-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	nicole		well then I'm not sure what the deal is let me try and create another user to see if the same thing happens
2010-10-24T01:44:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	do you use 64-bit version and an nvidia gfx card?

2010-10-24T01:46:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	bottom post
2010-10-24T01:46:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	the login screen will look bad, but after login it's fine :)
2010-10-24T01:48:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	because the work-around disables theming on the login screen.
2010-10-24T01:50:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	if you want to revert, just do the opposite of the fix: sudo mv /usr/share/gdm/nostart/gnome-settings-daemon.desktop /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/
2010-10-24T01:55:00.000Z	nicole	maedox	is it the same for the 32 bit install
2010-10-24T02:05:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	I'm here. Great. :D
2010-10-24T02:06:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	which apps?
2010-10-24T02:11:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	not sure what frostwire is for, but you really don't need adobe reader on ubuntu. In general installing ia32-libs might help you to run 32-bit apps on 64-bit edition. Can't help you with Boxee, but you can try to search for a boxee ppa to install from.
2010-10-24T02:15:00.000Z	nicole	maedox	? is there a way of installing 32 bit apps on 64 bit architecture
2010-10-24T02:18:00.000Z	maedox	nicole	yes, but you might have to compile them yourself. ia32-libs can work. But I'm not really that experienced with that, so you should look up some guide or see if someone else in here knows.
