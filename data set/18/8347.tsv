2007-09-03T05:14:00.000Z	dug_	soskel	see this thread, you may want to use damnsmalllinux or slax if you are running linux off a usb thumbdrive: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3174504
2007-09-03T05:15:00.000Z	soskel	dug_	I am only interested in server oriented distros
2007-09-03T05:16:00.000Z	dug_	soskel	there is a slax server edition
2007-09-03T05:17:00.000Z	soskel	dug_	Ahadiel ok, it says USB_CDROM USB_HDD and a few others.. witch one do I choose ?
2007-09-03T05:18:00.000Z	dug_	soskel	what says that?  if you want to boot to a usb thumbdrive/flashdrive, choose the usb_hdd one i believe
2007-09-03T05:18:00.000Z	soskel	dug_	my bios
2007-09-03T05:19:00.000Z	dug_	soskel	if you have no cd in the cd drive, the bios will skip over it and look at usb_hdd next for a bootable media
2007-09-03T05:23:00.000Z	soskel	dug_	Ahadiel I erased my iso... can I just put in my cd with it on it... and then move all the files and folders from the cs to the thumbdrive? for some reason... when I burned the iso to the disk.. it put a bunch of files on the cs
2007-09-03T05:25:00.000Z	dug_	soskel	i'm not quite following you.  if you want to boot ubuntu from a usb thumb/flash drive, these are the only instructions i've found (but again, apparently slax is better for this): http://pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610
2007-09-03T05:42:00.000Z	soskel	dug_	Ahadiel look, I have the options to boot from USB-HDD USB-CDROM USB-ZIP or USB-FDD. INside my thumbdrive I have a few files and folders that my cd created when I burned the ubuntu ISO to the cd....
