2006-03-17T10:05:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		there is only linux channels on freenode?
2006-03-17T10:07:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	in irssi I think /list works, but it is going to be ugly.
2006-03-17T10:08:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	What kind of channel do you want?
2006-03-17T10:08:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode	Nabiki	no idea... I mean too much linux... something to chat... and to find some chics :)
2006-03-17T10:08:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		lemme try
2006-03-17T10:09:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		this --> /cs list <-- unknown command
2006-03-17T10:09:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		I get this message  with /list DOING this is NOT A GOOD IDEA...
2006-03-17T10:09:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		so I am afraid to proceed
2006-03-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	 Freenode is primarily a dev network.  :P You will find a lot of computer people.  Linux, Windows, Mac, etc...  You will find a lot of channels devoted to GNU projects.  That is what the network is about mostly.  But you can look arround.
2006-03-17T10:10:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode		o.O 3000!!
2006-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	 That is why I said that it would be ugly in irssi.
2006-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode	Nabiki	aha... so there's little social enterntainment here...
2006-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	Console based irc clients are scarry.
2006-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	For people like those assembled in this channel, there is pleanty. :)
2006-03-17T10:11:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode	Nabiki	for instance a channel to talk about Space Exploration and stuff like that
2006-03-17T10:12:00.000Z	Nabiki		Let me do a /list real quick.  My client is window based. :P IT's safe for me. hehe
2006-03-17T10:12:00.000Z	Nabiki	DaLinuxCode	Are you running X11 or are you telneted?  How are you connected to the machine that you are connected to the IRC channel through? :)
2006-03-17T10:13:00.000Z	DaLinuxCode	Nabiki	X with irssi
