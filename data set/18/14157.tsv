2005-09-20T09:32:00.000Z	TMM		because it's the same everywhere
2005-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	TMM		and a pretty decent indication if something is wrong
2005-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	TMM		:)
2005-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	TMM		there's the whole geometry that's coded in ofcourse...
2005-09-20T09:33:00.000Z	TMM		I see the point
2005-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	TMM		BUT if direct rendering is: yes and you still get like 100fps in glxgears you know somewhat where to look
2005-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	TMM		I'll have to revise my whole troubleshooting scheme here
2005-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	TMM		/usr/lib to /usr/share ... really, shoot the guy that dreamt that up too
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	TMM		ESPECIALLY since it didn't update the xorg.conf file
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	TMM		we are going to have SOOOO much trouble here if that's not fixed before breezy launches
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	funkyHat_	TMM	you must have told it not to then...
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	funkyHat_	TMM	although it defaults not to if you've modified it
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	TMM	funkyHat_	I don't think it asked me
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	TMM	funkyHat_	it just put the fonts somewhere else and didn't update my xorg.conf file
2005-09-20T09:36:00.000Z	TMM	funkyHat_	luckely I've been fixing X errors since the dawn of time (so it feels) so it was no biggie, but still, for less experienced users... this is going to be a bit of a problem, *I* didn't even spot it
2005-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	funkyHat_	TMM	it's odd, yeah and could be pretty serious, but had you edited your xorg.conf? because mine was updated fine (i believe it asked me in fact)
2005-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	TMM	funkyHat_	I had to edit it manually
2005-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	TMM	funkyHat_	probably :)
