2006-09-08T12:10:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	i'll be the first one to say...debian's install absolutely sucks..specifically picking out enough packages to get a base system with a GUI with minimal bloat in order to install whatever you want from there
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	It's baised for servers, imho, but the install isn't honestly that bad. Tasksel is excellent.
2006-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	All centos is a cheap Redhat EE knockoff.
2006-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	It's sole reason for existance is that people don't want to actually pay for RH EE
2006-09-08T12:16:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	a redhat knock off of course, but not necessarilly cheap...i've migrated my home server to ubuntu because i also use it as a a desktop sharing my mouse/keyboard with my laptop using synergy but i've setup about a half dozen centos boxes serving all kinds of things and they are very stable
2006-09-08T12:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	So, how much is Centos?
2006-09-08T12:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	Why would you run Centos instead of RH EE?
2006-09-08T12:18:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	absolulytey! no one likes subscription based services especially in terms of support if you don't need it...hell that's the whole reason the .NET project will eventually fail because that is what they are/were banking on
2006-09-08T12:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	I think you're confused about .NET, but that's understandable given MS's confusing advertising.
2006-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	Then run Debian Sarge.
2006-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	i don't think i am....NET is intended to foster web services which in turn would allow microsoft to charge for services it and sponsored providers would provide
2006-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	I think you're talking about the Passport service.
2006-09-08T12:21:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	no that is .NET...i read a HBV case study about it this summer
2006-09-08T12:21:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	url?
2006-09-08T12:23:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	gimme a second...i might have the unencrypted version still on my hd...i had to pay for it originally and it came with a bunch of DRM
2006-09-08T12:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	Ah, then I don't want it.
2006-09-08T12:23:00.000Z	Arafangion	Gevaudan82	But if it's in a database, such as ACM, tell me enough to let me find it myself :)
2006-09-08T12:23:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Arafangion	fair enough
