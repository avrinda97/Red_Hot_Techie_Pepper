2010-09-18T08:43:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	I presume you're trying to edit your only OS partition from a Live CD?
2010-09-18T08:43:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	yes
2010-09-18T08:43:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	Good.  do you see the lock icons next to the partitions?
2010-09-18T08:44:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	yes
2010-09-18T08:44:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	That means the partitions are currently mounted.  Right click and then unmount and you should be able to edit them.
2010-09-18T08:45:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	Note that you cannot resize the extended partition without first unmounting ALL logical ones.
2010-09-18T08:47:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	how do i unmount those logical partitions?
2010-09-18T08:47:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	It will automatically mount them, but don't worry; you can unmount them and they'll be fine.  Mounted just means that you can access the data on them and you can use them (like your swap is mounted so your Live CD is currently using it, I believe.  You might need to do something in the terminal before you can unmount it).
2010-09-18T08:48:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	Read what I wrote earlier.  (That means the...)
2010-09-18T08:49:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	Actually, that may not have been super clear.  Right click, and you'll see a menu.  On that, click "unmount".
2010-09-18T08:49:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	There will only be a few options that aren't gray-ed out.
2010-09-18T08:49:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	thanks, will try that!
2010-09-18T08:49:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	Do that for all three.
2010-09-18T09:48:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	thanks again, your tips worked
2010-09-18T09:48:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	no problem :)
2010-09-18T10:17:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	nimbiotics	start stop ubuntu immediately?  Do you mean it doesn't give you a chance to select another partition to boot from?
2010-09-18T10:18:00.000Z	nimbiotics	LinuxFetus	rite. i'd like it to start ubuntu immediately. ive read its possible but all documentation i find is complicated for me
