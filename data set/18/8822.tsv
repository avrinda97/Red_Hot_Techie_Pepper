2007-06-21T05:21:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	try running mplayer as root
2007-06-21T05:23:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	how do I run mplayer from terminal?
2007-06-21T05:23:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	sudo mplayer path/to/some/videofile
2007-06-21T05:25:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	how do I handle files with a space in them?
2007-06-21T05:26:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	press TAB key as you type the path.. it will autocomplete
2007-06-21T05:28:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	Ok, it worked this way, but is there a solution so I don't have to use the terminal every time?
2007-06-21T05:28:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	it works this way for me... i still don't know why it doesn't run as a normal user
2007-06-21T05:31:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	just got it working the "normal way" by selecting the gl2 vo driver
2007-06-21T05:31:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	where did you select it?
2007-06-21T05:31:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	preferences -> video
2007-06-21T05:31:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	thanks!
2007-06-21T05:32:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	tell me if it works
2007-06-21T05:34:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	its playing the movie in an awkward fashion!
2007-06-21T05:34:00.000Z	bronze-	kazim59	you might wanna try another driver, then? I think it's kinda dependent on your setup, but gl2 worked for me.
2007-06-21T05:38:00.000Z	kazim59	bronze-	so... xv worked
