2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	MaTaKs		i already installed them
2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 what player are you using?  do you get some sort of error?
2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 have you tried different wmv files?
2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	MaTaKs	_jason	 yes
2005-11-04T13:35:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 how did you install w32codecs
2005-11-04T13:38:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 iirc the latest wmv wncryption cannot be played... that may be the problem
2005-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 encoding*
2005-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 if this file is available online i can tell you if it plays for me
2005-11-04T13:41:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 I don't know of a way to play wmv10 files
2005-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 do you mean the shortcuts like in prefs->keyboard shortcuts?
2005-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	MaTaKs	_jason	yes
2005-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 those are the only I know about, you can edit that to your hearts content or just read it over to see what is available
2005-11-05T07:59:00.000Z	MaTaKs	_jason	where can i find volume control?, my volume control icon dissapears on the try
2005-11-05T08:00:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 the panel applet?
2005-11-05T08:01:00.000Z	_jason	MaTaKs	 it is a panel applet, not sure why it disappeared.  Just right click on the panel and add applet, then look for volume control
2005-11-05T08:02:00.000Z	MaTaKs	_jason	i found the volume control and add it, thnx :)
