2010-09-24T12:05:00.000Z	tripelb		in windows I use sumatra as a pdf reader and I'm very happy with it. what is good for ubuntu?
2010-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	Ubuntu comes with Evince, it can read several formats besides just PDF.
2010-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	tripelb		I do not think that the bios has a setting to "protect" the MBR. Every OS installer writes the MBR. So do some viruses.
2010-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	 well then why does clicking on a pdf ask me to download Adome Reader?
2010-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	Where are you clicking on this PDF?
2010-09-24T12:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	I'm pretty sure that Firefox will open PDF's in Evince by default, I'm not 100% sure though.
2010-09-24T12:10:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	are yo a physicist? (Just spent an hour on a Feynman video - consumer level, lol) but I've got a firm science background and have this personal expression for a certain idea I call "Godpudding" (it's all one).  Thought you might be thinking in similar lines. --- I'll get you the link. I use chrome.
2010-09-24T12:10:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	 could this webpage have restricted me to Adome? http://www.scriptorpress.com/cenacle/73-74.html
2010-09-24T12:11:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	I dont see Evince in Internet or in Office (under Applications)
2010-09-24T12:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	That's different, the file almost surely will open in Evince after you download it. It's just saying you need Adobe REader because on Windows there isn't a PDF reader included.
2010-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	what happens when you click on it?
2010-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	It begins downloading the file.
2010-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	Are you clicking on the link with Adobe REader, or the picture? You should click the picture.
2010-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	tripelb	also it is normally called Document Viewer in the menus, but the program's actual name is evince.
2010-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding		it's kinda spotty on that, annoyingly.
2010-09-24T12:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding		calling it Document Viewer some places, Evince in others
2010-09-24T12:14:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	Yea, I figured it out the wrong link. Yep "Document Viewer  Using poppler/cairo (0.12.4) -- by the authors of evince. - as you said.
2010-09-24T12:15:00.000Z	tripelb	tensorpudding	attracted by the green print, lol. And your name, can you tell me what it means. PM is ok if not here.
