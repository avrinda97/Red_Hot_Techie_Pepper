2011-12-06T14:11:00.000Z	x	mazda01	if you are writing zero's then heck yea dude. 160gb of 0's is alot.
2011-12-06T14:12:00.000Z	x	mazda01	not really drives fail whenever they want.
2011-12-06T14:12:00.000Z	x	mazda01	and by doing tons of stress tests or whatever to make sure it won't fail, you might make it fail haha!
2011-12-06T14:13:00.000Z	x	mazda01	check it for bad sectors, if no bad sectors. then it's not currently DOA
2011-12-06T14:15:00.000Z	x	mazda01	anyway I have gotten like 10 hd's over the years with 'bad sectors' on them as soon as I got them they spin up, but they are useless since they are already failing and will only give problems.
2011-12-06T14:16:00.000Z	x	mazda01	um, under system administration like gnome-disk-utility or something shows if you have bad sectors
2011-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	x	mazda01	not sure. I used to have it (though im on fluxbox now) and I would like to get it again my self actually. apt-cache says package name is gnome-disk-utility but I can't find the executable for some reason... hrmmm
2011-12-06T14:21:00.000Z	x	mazda01	yea I just figured that out on google
2011-12-06T14:21:00.000Z	x	mazda01	that is the one i was talking about.
2011-12-06T14:22:00.000Z	x	mazda01	if you select a disk, on the right it shows its status if it's healthy or has bad sectors! you can even do benchmarks on it.
2011-12-06T14:23:00.000Z	x	mazda01	idk cause this was an Xubuntu (xfce ubuntu) install that I changed to fluxbox, so I make my own custom menu entry's for programs I actually use, some times like just a second ago it can be annoying to find a programs name when it's nothing to do with the package heh ;-) but I love fluxbox so it's worth it. and it does auto-add most stuff to the menus'
2011-12-06T14:25:00.000Z	x	mazda01	yea I diudn't like flux the first few times, and I didn't do it for the memory use although I did go from like 24% use on xfce to 11% on flux which is nice ;-) I just like how fluxbox is and I map all my favorite programs to alt + letter keys so it's ez to launch stuff anyway. it's just very fast
2011-12-06T14:27:00.000Z	x	mazda01	exactly unlimited options, and they are all free!
2011-12-06T14:29:00.000Z	x	mazda01	umm... select a disk then left side of the pain where the smart data is.
2011-12-06T14:30:00.000Z	x	mazda01	I do have a 1tb with 1 bad block. just 99.9% of the time  you will get alot more bad blocks soon.
2011-12-06T14:33:00.000Z	x	mazda01	you can only do a read benchmark if the disk has partitions on it I believe
2011-12-06T14:45:00.000Z	x	mazda01	I think he is right though honestly....
