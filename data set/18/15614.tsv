2005-02-21T10:14:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	you're in Indy right now?
2005-02-21T09:54:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	hello
2005-02-21T09:55:00.000Z	meuserj|work	tritium	hey... when you came into #pulug and mentioned #ubuntu, I decided to come in here for a while.
2005-02-21T09:55:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	cool! :)  Are you using it?
2005-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	meuserj|work	tritium	yeah.. and very happy with it.  I don't spend much time in here because I always end up getting involved on here and not get any work done.
2005-02-21T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	I had tried to convince Greg to setup an ubuntu mirror here at Purdue.  He hadn't heard of it at that time.  Now that's it's tops in distrowatch, I wonder if he'd reconsider?
2005-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	Me too, I need to be focusing on my research :)
2005-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	meuserj|work	tritium	would I know you from Purdue?
2005-02-21T09:57:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	I don't know.  I'm a PhD candidate in ECE.  You?
2005-02-21T09:59:00.000Z	meuserj|work	tritium	I'm a recent grad from cs, work in Indy and go to Laf pretty often.. I post to the plug mailing list a lot, first name is John.
2005-02-21T10:00:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	Hi John.  Stop by MSEE 296 if you're ever around.

2005-02-21T10:15:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	have you ever been to progeny?
2005-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	meuserj|work	tritium	no, but I've thought about checking them out sometime.. I met Ian at the thing PLUG had a while back at Jakes.
2005-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	tritium	meuserj|work	cool, right here in Debian's birthplace :)
