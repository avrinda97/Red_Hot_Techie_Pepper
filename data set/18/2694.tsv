2011-03-12T12:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis		ive had old pendrives now work wiht some old machines..

2011-03-12T12:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis		you could even boot a cd, and do a normal install to a pendrive.

2011-03-12T12:52:00.000Z	W43372	dr_Willis	I just installed, hwclock had the correct time but it's timezone is HAST. I don't live in hawaii. The clock on the panel is wrong, but when I click on it and check my location it has the correct city and the correct time, but the panel is still wrong.
2011-03-12T12:52:00.000Z	dr_Willis		i doubt if there is a specific tutorial for vbox->pendrvive., Get vbox seeing the flash drives. and  set it up
2011-03-12T12:53:00.000Z	dr_Willis		w43372 - it could be a 'clock set to UST/GMT  vs Localtime type issue.'
2011-03-12T12:53:00.000Z	W43372	dr_Willis	how do fix?
2011-03-12T12:53:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ruan	wiuth the guest addations - i think so
2011-03-12T12:54:00.000Z	dr_Willis		w43372 check what your hw clock is set to in bios
2011-03-12T13:00:00.000Z	W43372	dr_Willis	the bios hw was wrong, I fixed it but my problem is still the same
2011-03-12T13:01:00.000Z	W43372	dr_Willis	sudo hwclock -r is still accurate but in HAST timezone, panel is wrong, but locations still has correct city and time
