2008-03-16T13:48:00.000Z	moah		hello alltogether
2008-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	moah		has anyone here encountered a problem with ubuntu cds not booting on a somewhat older computer, while other distributions (and windows) do boot without a problem?
2008-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	define problem
2008-03-16T13:51:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	ubuntu cd does not boot, other cds boot.
2008-03-16T13:51:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	define "does not boot" do you get a menu at all?
2008-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	it is a somewhat older computer (4-5 years), so could it be that modern ubuntu cds use something this old computer does not support any more?
2008-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	no, the computer simply ignores the CD and proceeds to boot the installed system.
2008-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	could be, but you should at least be getting the menu
2008-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	ooo, ok, that's why i was asking
2008-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	woah, that's weird... i'd do an image integrity check like flowOver suggested
2008-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	yes, it does not even reckognize cd as bootable, i suppose.
2008-03-16T13:54:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	did you try it on any other comp?
2008-03-16T13:54:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	i didnt do any integrity checks yet, but this behaviour repeated with several ubuntu releases in the last past year.
2008-03-16T13:55:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	you may want to report a bug then
2008-03-16T13:56:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	you could check launchpad
2008-03-16T13:59:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	did you ever try a canonical live cd?
2008-03-16T13:59:00.000Z	moah	leo_rockw	yes, the normal ubuntu release iso.
2008-03-16T13:59:00.000Z	leo_rockw	moah	i mean shipit cds
