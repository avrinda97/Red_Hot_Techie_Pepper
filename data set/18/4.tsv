2004-10-26T11:37:00.000Z	netventure	mdz	just curious, but why is the 810 module blacklisted?
2004-10-26T11:37:00.000Z	netventure		I have a via82xx, and it's blacklisted too?
2004-10-26T11:38:00.000Z	netventure		(audio modules)
2004-10-26T11:39:00.000Z	netventure		baham, have you tried i810_audio?
2004-10-26T11:40:00.000Z	netventure		rmmod snd-i8x0 and then modprobe i810_audio
2004-10-26T11:40:00.000Z	netventure		hmmm..
2004-10-26T11:40:00.000Z	netventure		looks like the driver is broken...
2004-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	netventure		baham: here's something about alan cox from an old archive: http://www.spinics.net/lists/rhsound/msg00009.html
2004-10-26T11:44:00.000Z	netventure		not a solution, but that's the best I could find
2004-10-26T11:45:00.000Z	netventure		has anyone been able to get radeonfb working on the console?
2004-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	netventure		socom: is there a console only runlevel in ubuntu?
2004-10-26T11:50:00.000Z	netventure		kamion: can you give me a few tips, having come from slackware, I find it a little difficult to use sysV and debian
2004-10-26T11:51:00.000Z	mdz	netventure	all of the OSS modules are blacklisted, because there are ALSA modules which are equivalent or better
2004-10-26T11:51:00.000Z	mdz	netventure	and you can't mix OSS and ALSA modules on the same device
2004-10-26T11:52:00.000Z	mdz	netventure	radeonfb is known to have a lot of problems, that's why it isn't loaded by default
2004-10-26T11:52:00.000Z	netventure	mdz	I'm new to debian, how do I tell the OS, which modules to load?
2004-10-26T11:55:00.000Z	netventure	mdz	I've been able to use radeonfb on slackware, it loads on ubuntu, but then the screen is blank during boot until the console font is changed
2004-10-26T11:56:00.000Z	netventure	mdz	but then again, it's only a plain text console, no fb :(
