2011-11-11T10:06:00.000Z	khayyam		is there a program/app list somewhere off of the ubuntu 11.10 desktop?
2011-11-11T10:07:00.000Z	khayyam		all I see is a quick launch bar
2011-11-11T10:08:00.000Z	grandy	khayyam	hmm, on mine this orange area appears some of the time and i can't figure out what it's doing... it's unlike any UI I've seen
2011-11-11T10:08:00.000Z	khayyam	grandy	that sounds kinda like uhmm.... your mouse key is activated?
2011-11-11T10:09:00.000Z	khayyam		like when you move windows to the left and right of the desktop something like that appears usually
2011-11-11T10:09:00.000Z	khayyam	grandy	do you have a mousepad? maybe it's clicked in
2011-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	khayyam		does ubuntu 11.10 have a programs list ?
2011-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	grandy	khayyam	oh maybe that's it, but that isn't doing anything, it doesn't let me slide windows to the next desktop
2011-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	grandy		yeah that's exactly what the thing looks like
2011-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	grandy		so something must be triggering it
2011-11-11T10:10:00.000Z	khayyam		i don't believe that's what it's for grandy, its for putting a window on the right or left half of your current desktop
2011-11-11T10:11:00.000Z	khayyam		displaying*
2011-11-11T10:11:00.000Z	khayyam		this must be a bad time for support :P
2011-11-11T10:11:00.000Z	grandy		it looks like the regular way that the screen highligts when you want to drag a window, but it just doesn't go away
2011-11-11T10:12:00.000Z	khayyam		did you try restarting?
2011-11-11T10:13:00.000Z	khayyam		is there a way to start a program with the terminal but have the terminal close?
2011-11-11T10:13:00.000Z	khayyam		w/out closing the program
2011-11-11T10:14:00.000Z	grandy	khayyam	yeah you can put an icon on the bar that essentially does that
