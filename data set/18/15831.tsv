2006-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	ITSa341		I'm trying to install GNUstep Position http://www.gnustep.it/enrico/position/  When I run "make install" I get this error. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10368 Can someone give me some insight into what I am doing wrong??
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	ITSa341		GAIM 2.0  sucks imho
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	ITSa341		I prefer the default GAIM in Ubuntu
2006-03-22T10:13:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 is there a readme file?  you probably have to run ./configure first or "make" first , before you make install
2006-03-22T10:15:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 sec...
2006-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 you have to compile it
2006-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 there's a README in the PROJ.4 subdirectory
2006-03-22T10:20:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 hmm actually that's just the projection sw, the Project makefile is referencing files that don't exist.  that's why you're getitng those errors.
2006-03-22T10:21:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 i think you need to apt-get install gnustep-make
2006-03-22T10:22:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 sudo updatedb  then locate aggregate.make
2006-03-22T10:24:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 if you have those files it's yelling about you probably just need to set the GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES environment var to point to the directory they're in.
2006-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 do   export GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES=/path/to/the/files   then try the make install
2006-03-22T10:34:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 i've never used gps on any os :] 
2006-03-22T11:07:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 yeah that's different- now you're getting build errors, congratulations :] 
2006-03-22T11:09:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 that seems to be an objective C something or other... you prolly need objc libs & stuff.
2006-03-22T11:09:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 try installing gobjc-4.0
2006-03-22T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 see now it's getting difficult.  you set up the build environment (installed gnumake, pointed at the makefile directory, installed objc compiler) but these are either coding errors or libary version mismatch problems or something...   i don't know how to help you further.
2006-03-22T11:19:00.000Z	wastrel	ITSa341	 check the mailing list or contact the author of the program :]
