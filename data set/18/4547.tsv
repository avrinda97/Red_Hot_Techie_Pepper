2009-03-26T04:19:00.000Z	bluenzo		thanks oCean_
2009-03-26T04:20:00.000Z	bluenzo		regardless oCean_ , how do I search the repositories for an app?
2009-03-26T04:20:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	Graphical through menu (add/remove) or command: "apt-cache search <string>"
2009-03-28T03:28:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	you're back!
2009-03-28T03:29:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	It seems that Ikonia is away from keyboard, for time being. Anyway it might be good advice to decribe your problem, including some details (like things you've already tried)
2009-03-28T03:30:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	when you do that in a pastebin link, you can paste that link every so now and then in the channel, asking for help, but no longer have the need to re-word your problems over and over again
2009-03-28T03:33:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	did you see my advice?
2009-03-28T03:36:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	I ask you once more. Have you seen my advice?
2009-03-28T03:36:00.000Z	bluenzo	oCean_	what advice?
2009-03-28T03:36:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	the couple of lines I send to you, just a few minutes ago
2009-03-28T03:37:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	I now you were here earlier, I know what happened. That is why I recommend to decribe your problem + details (like what you've already done/tried) in a pastebin link
2009-03-28T03:37:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	I'm just trying to help you
2009-03-28T03:38:00.000Z	bluenzo	oCean_	well i kinda fixed the problem, i just need to do something...kinda like A or B, but im not sure which
2009-03-28T03:38:00.000Z	bluenzo	oCean_	in grub, how do I know which HDD to type in "setup" command
2009-03-28T03:38:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	ok, now *that* is a very great question!
2009-03-28T03:39:00.000Z	oCean_	bluenzo	very straightforward, no nonsense. However, unfortunately I'm not that grub expert. But that question is absolutely one you can ask the channel right here
2009-03-28T03:39:00.000Z	bluenzo	oCean_	:(
