2009-12-24T02:31:00.000Z	irc_newb		for some reason, when i login locally to my server, i can ssh into from remote just fine; as soon as i log out locally though, i can't ....
2009-12-24T02:33:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	explain that again.
2009-12-24T03:12:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	that is when you log in locally too?
2009-12-24T03:15:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	did you try with just a username and password instead of keys?
2009-12-24T03:15:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	sounds like a problem with the key almost.
2009-12-24T03:15:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	i'll try that now...
2009-12-24T03:18:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	it works fine with just using the password...
2009-12-24T03:18:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	you have to revisit your key setup, I think.
2009-12-24T03:18:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	did you follow a tutorial, or how did you set that up?
2009-12-24T03:19:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	i did, sort of.. but it works when i'm logged in locally. could it be a permission issue?
2009-12-24T03:20:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	dunno, what are the steps you took?
2009-12-24T03:20:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	installed openssh-server, configured it to work only with keys....
2009-12-24T03:22:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	when i setup up the server, i set it to automatically encrypt my home dir, could that be why? it can't compare the keys because they;re encrypted?

2009-12-24T03:26:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	could be, I suppose.
2009-12-24T03:26:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	so how would i fix that?
2009-12-24T03:27:00.000Z	dabaR	irc_newb	It is beyond my experience.
2009-12-24T03:28:00.000Z	irc_newb	dabaR	ty for the insight, ill surf a little
