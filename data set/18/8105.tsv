2007-09-30T13:03:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	 i like that one pretty good.  no { in it though, at the beginning there
2007-09-30T13:03:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	thanks. is that opens a screen at the begin?
2007-09-30T13:05:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	 it starts a screen session.  screen is like a window manager for the console.   and if you close the aterm window, and open it later, that same screen opens back up, which is kinda cool
2007-09-30T13:05:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	indeed it is, thanks for the sharing.
2007-09-30T13:06:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	 also, if you install asciiquarium, and edit your .screenrc, you get a really cool screensaver for your console.  the line in .screenrc, is near the bottom
2007-09-30T13:06:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	cool i'll give it a shot
2007-09-30T13:06:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	 want some commands to compile asciiquarium ?
2007-09-30T13:06:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	yeah please, but i'm right now installing few files for Kde

2007-09-30T13:09:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	what WM do you use
2007-09-30T13:11:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	 i use fluxbox, and its awesome.  been using if for like 5 years or so.  i spent a year with gnome not too long back.  really happy to be back in flux
2007-09-30T13:11:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	ah yea fluxbox runs smooth, cause its not heavy. but thing is you can't put shortcuts in desktop
2007-09-30T13:13:00.000Z	gonzoism	org_	i use idesk for icons.  but don't ever click them.  :)  mostly i just use bash, firefox, and well... that's it really.
2007-09-30T13:13:00.000Z	org_	gonzoism	cool
