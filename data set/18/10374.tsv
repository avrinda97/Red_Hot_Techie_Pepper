2007-01-22T14:45:00.000Z	stephans	adaptr	i tried gnome rdp and tsclient
2007-01-22T14:46:00.000Z	stephans	adaptr	i think that it needs some kind of preauth
2007-01-22T14:46:00.000Z	adaptr	stephans	not at all, but you need to provide the right data - hostname, username, (domain), password
2007-01-22T14:47:00.000Z	stephans	adaptr	I can connect fine to all xp machines
