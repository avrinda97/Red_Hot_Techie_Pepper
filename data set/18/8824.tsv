2007-06-24T11:06:00.000Z	pha|con		When i press the "play" button on my keyboard rythmbox starts.  how do i change the default mp3 play for the OS to be amarok?
2007-06-24T11:07:00.000Z	pha|con		i've already set the properties of mp3's to start with beep-media-player, so when i double click them individually they start in beep, but i want amarok to start when i press my "music player" hotkey

2007-06-24T11:08:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	then you can set it to amarok and thats it :)
2007-06-24T11:08:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	no, i've already done that
2007-06-24T11:08:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	no you selected open with
2007-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	that's for starting individual files.  my keyboard has "hotkeys" that can start individual programs with the press of one button.  pressing my "media player" button starts rythmbox, but i want it to start amarok
2007-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	i'm wondering how to tell gnome that i want my default media play to be amarok and not rythmbox
2007-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	go to #kubuntu , amarok is a KDE app
2007-06-24T11:10:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	actuallt there is an app for that , one second
2007-06-24T11:10:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	i think it's more of a matter of telling ubuntu what the default app should be, it's not an option from within amarok
2007-06-24T11:13:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	sudo apt-get install hotkeys
2007-06-24T11:15:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	 my hotkeys work.  if i press my browser hotkey firefox opens and if i press my email hotkey thunderbird opens and my volume hotkeys work
2007-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	i just want ubuntu to know that amarok is my mp3 player of choice and not rythmbox
2007-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	defrysk	pha|con	I understand
2007-06-24T11:17:00.000Z	pha|con	defrysk	plus, my keyboard isn't supported :/
