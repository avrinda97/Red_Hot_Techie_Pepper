2009-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	Joeseph		Magnesium: I can ping the server with the name, and I have tried remounting it with 'sudo mount -a'
2009-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	But it gives you an error? What error exactly?
2009-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	well, if I look at it in nautilus, it just hangs forever.  seems to be the same if I try to 'ls' the dir in the terminal.
2009-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	might be a silly question, but is your networking up? Can you ping google.com?
2009-11-06T09:01:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	Yeah.  My internet is acting slow, but I *think* that is an irrelevant issue.
2009-11-06T09:02:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	Hmmm...give me a minute, I've got another suggestion comin'
2009-11-06T09:04:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	Hmmm....  it seems to be working now, just being unworkably slow.
2009-11-06T09:05:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	Okay...good to hear. I thought that might be it, since you weren't getting any errors.
2009-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	How exactly are you connecting? Do you type smb://whatever into the address bar, or do you mount it to a directory on your computer?
2009-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	I have it mounted in the fstab via ... smb I believe.
2009-11-06T09:07:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	The problem could be on the Windows side...  I'm going to take a quick look at it from a spare windows laptop and see what happens.
2009-11-06T09:08:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	Alright...I use the smbmount program to connect to samba shares...i.e., sudo smbmount //sharename /some/path/on/your/computer
2009-11-06T09:08:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	Don't know if it's any different
2009-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	Yeah.  Just looked.  I use "smbfs" in the fstab.  Laptop is booting up...  results in a minute...
2009-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	Yeah... The windows laptop is bringing up the windows share just as slowly.... Should have known it was a windows problem....  great.  I hate windows problems...
2009-11-06T09:14:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	haha...well, you've passed into the dark side...out of reach...
2009-11-06T09:15:00.000Z	Joeseph	Magnesium	Alright, well thanks for your help.  Wish me luck!
2009-11-06T09:15:00.000Z	Magnesium	Joeseph	No problem, wish I could have been more help...hope you get it worked out, though! :-)
