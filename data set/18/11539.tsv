2007-08-10T11:16:00.000Z	godzirra		Can anyone help me get my xorg working with the nvidia driver?  I seem to be having trouble getting it to work.
2007-08-10T11:18:00.000Z	godzirra		I havent downloaded anything from nvidia's site...
2007-08-10T11:18:00.000Z	godzirra		I've just tried configuring via nvidia-xconfig and using that xorg.conf
2007-08-10T11:19:00.000Z	godzirra		uhh ok.  why not?
2007-08-10T11:19:00.000Z	godzirra		I'm using feisty yes.
2007-08-10T11:19:00.000Z	godzirra		If you have another solution I'm all for it.
2007-08-10T11:20:00.000Z	godzirra		I just want to get it working.
2007-08-10T11:20:00.000Z	godzirra		I don't think so?
2007-08-10T11:20:00.000Z	godzirra		But I think it was enabled to begin with
2007-08-10T11:20:00.000Z	godzirra		since I have a wireless driver thats restricted.
2007-08-10T11:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	godzirra	then there is your problem I already asked you in ubuntu-effects :\
2007-08-10T11:21:00.000Z	godzirra	Paddy_EIRE	Which problem?
2007-08-10T11:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	godzirra	follow neverblue advice
2007-08-10T11:21:00.000Z	godzirra	Paddy_EIRE	I started trying to fix the resolution problem, realized I was running on the vesa drivers, and havent tried anythingh else.
2007-08-10T11:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	godzirra	use the restricted driver manager
2007-08-10T11:25:00.000Z	godzirra	Paddy_EIRE	I'm not entirely how you mean for me to use it.  I opened it up and it shows myt wireless card.
2007-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	godzirra	what video card exactly do you have
2007-08-10T11:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	godzirra	key word is 'Most' not 'all' ;)
