2004-11-04T15:56:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	do you feel it is a good idea to mix two sources in one line?
2004-11-04T15:57:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	no, but as they are on the same server and it's done in the default setup too i think it's ok
2004-11-04T15:58:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	in default setup there were no multiverse for me at all...
2004-11-04T15:58:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	but mixed repos ;)
2004-11-04T15:58:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty-security main restricted 
2004-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	is in my defaults
2004-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	yes, I understand...
2004-11-04T15:59:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	well, there is no problem with it, just feels *for me* somehow not-so-right... 
2004-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	thanks :)
2004-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	:-)
2004-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	apt-file is also a great tool btw
2004-11-04T16:26:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	but you have to install it, and apt-cache is always there :-)
2004-11-04T16:27:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	yep, but it's the missing functionality ..... compared to packages.debian.org
2004-11-04T16:27:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	and it is Perl, meaning Evil.
2004-11-04T16:27:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	hey, i'm a perl guy
2004-11-04T16:27:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	I'm sorry for you :-))
2004-11-04T16:28:00.000Z	ogra	alexey	i'd try python, but i get lost without all the brackets *g*
2004-11-04T16:29:00.000Z	alexey	ogra	you know, some time ago I tried Python. And I was lost. And it happened 4 or 5 times. And one day I managed to force me to read tutorial. Now I hardly remember anything about Perl :-)
