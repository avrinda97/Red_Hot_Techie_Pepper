2008-03-08T15:38:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	did you try ftp:_ftp.lfs-matrix.net_pub_lfs-livecd_ like it said?
2008-03-08T15:42:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	my bad wrong paste =P
2008-03-08T15:42:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	meant to say apt-get -f install
2008-03-08T15:44:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	no, apt-get -f install doesn't fix it, I'm afraid
2008-03-08T15:48:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	this is what happens when I run -f install : http://pastebin.org/22840
2008-03-08T15:52:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	it looks like all those -sharp packages are causing the problems
2008-03-08T15:53:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	I would be happy to remove them but seeing as apt is broken I don't get very far
2008-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	apt wont let you remove them either? neither will aptitude?
2008-03-08T15:59:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	errors encountered when tyring to remove the -sharp packages : http://pastebin.org/22841
2008-03-08T16:01:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	you could try to satisfy apt by installing all those depends and then trying to remove them later?
2008-03-08T16:02:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	How would I install those when apt is broken?
2008-03-08T16:03:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	because hopefully that will fix it
2008-03-08T16:04:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	, I'm convinced your solution will work , but seeing as apt breaks on any install I'm not sure on how to proceed installing those packages
2008-03-08T16:05:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	it wouldnt install those either?
2008-03-08T16:07:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	no those won't install . this is what is returned: http://pastebin.org/22760
2008-03-08T16:11:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	you able to help me any further? otherwise I'll be afk
2008-03-08T16:13:00.000Z	cpk1	JC_Denton_	probably not, brain is mostly fried this late at night and I am in and out of irc
2008-03-08T16:13:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	cpk1	ok , thanks for your efforts
