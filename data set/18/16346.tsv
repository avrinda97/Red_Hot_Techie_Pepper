2004-10-05T05:19:00.000Z	Brooman		what bootloader does ubuntu install by default? lilo or grub?
2004-10-05T05:19:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	grub
2004-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	Brooman		are you absolutely sure? I have never had this kind of mbr trouble because of grub
2004-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	what kind of trouble?
2004-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	Brooman		winxp gets an error on boot up now..error loading operating system..and halts
2004-10-05T05:22:00.000Z	Brooman		this NEVER happened before trying to install ubuntu
2004-10-05T05:22:00.000Z	Brooman		i need to know how to wipe the mbr clean..windows xp fixmbr and fixboot will not fix the problem
2004-10-05T05:23:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	i think it is a common problem with kernel 2.6 distros
2004-10-05T05:23:00.000Z	Brooman	cardador	never happened with gentoo. 
2004-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	the partition table is changed and winxp is too dumb to figure out how to boot
2004-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	Brooman	cardador	whatever..i just need to know how to get it back to normal..i have shit to do that i can't do in linux..anyway..i reformatted the whole drive and it still happens..any ideas?
2004-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	try google for it. you'll find out something about changing the hard disk geometry form CHS or auto to LBA in you pc BIOS

2004-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	Brooman	cardador	I wiped all those partitions...only thing left to wipe is mbr..do you know how to accomplish this?
2004-10-05T05:27:00.000Z	cardador	Brooman	have you tried the fixmbr command?
2004-10-05T05:27:00.000Z	cardador		with the winxp cd
2004-10-05T05:27:00.000Z	Brooman	cardador	yes..did not work..
