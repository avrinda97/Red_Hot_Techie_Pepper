2004-10-19T09:02:00.000Z	tseng		because i didnt upload sources for most of the packages?
2004-10-19T09:02:00.000Z	tseng		since i didnt change them from debian unstable
2004-10-19T09:02:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	but there are sources for some of them
2004-10-19T09:05:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	so to make packages, you added debian unstable to your sources, did apt-get source for all of the packages, and built and installed each one in the proper depedency order?
2004-10-19T09:07:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	lost me there, why would you need mono installed to get the mono packages to compile.. its just c source. ?
2004-10-19T09:07:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	...
2004-10-19T09:08:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	you need a mono compiler to build mono
2004-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	i still don't see why, you can build mono from source on other platforms without mono installed..
2004-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	sure alot of is written in c# ..
2004-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	ok, since you are the expert.
2004-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	go have at it
2004-10-19T09:10:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	sorry didn't mean to be rude.
2004-10-19T09:10:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	so what i'm thinking is install mono in /opt/mono add it the path, build the packages 
2004-10-22T09:36:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	yes.
2004-10-26T15:08:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	hm, is it working now?
2004-10-26T15:08:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	i dunno i did a source install of the whole mono stack
2004-10-26T15:09:00.000Z	hazmat	tseng	out of curosity have you tried mcatalog(.sf.net) ?
2004-10-26T15:10:00.000Z	tseng	hazmat	no.
