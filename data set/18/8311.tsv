2008-01-10T07:07:00.000Z	Ward1983	soundray	jsut in case: this is right? "apt-file search|find esd.h"

2008-01-10T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	Ward1983	do a 'sudo apt-file update' first if you haven't already

2008-01-10T07:14:00.000Z	Ward1983	soundray	if the file doesnt show up, can i look somewhere else on the net or something?
