2008-11-05T08:28:00.000Z	Frijolie		what's the best way to install a minimial install of Ubuntu?
2008-11-05T08:29:00.000Z	Frijolie		er minimal install
2008-11-05T08:29:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	get a server cd and install base
2008-11-05T08:29:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	its gonna ask you for the server role at some point just choose nothing and you'll end up with a very basic installation
2008-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	does it have GUI?
2008-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	no just console
2008-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	is there a minimal GNOME package?
2008-11-05T08:30:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	nope gnome is pretty bloated
2008-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	a ubuntu branded GNOME is bloated
2008-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	but there are alternative like xfce or if u want something faster lxde
2008-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	that's what I'm trying to avoid...KDE is 1,000x worse
2008-11-05T08:31:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	gnome is bloated as is
2008-11-05T08:32:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	I dig on GNOME, just not the ubuntu bloat. Can you get a base install of GNOME?
2008-11-05T08:33:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	not that i know, you'll pretty much have to go and pick the gnome packages u want manually
2008-11-05T08:33:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	its a tedious task
2008-11-05T08:34:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	Hmm, so it may not be any better than installing ubuntu-desktop then spend 2 hours purging 3/4ths the packages ubuntu piles on..
2008-11-05T08:34:00.000Z	usser	Frijolie	yep pretty much the same
2008-11-05T08:35:00.000Z	Frijolie	usser	d'oh!
