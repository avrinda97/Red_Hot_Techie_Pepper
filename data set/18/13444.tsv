2006-03-12T15:42:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	or just asinine.
2006-03-12T15:44:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	even ripping would mean decoding the MP3s, and thus violating the patents.
2006-03-12T15:44:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	no, I mean re-ripping from his CD's
2006-03-12T15:44:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	i see
2006-03-12T15:45:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	so he'll just have to use ones that do ;p
2006-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	or store them on his PC as ogg, and convert to mp3 when he exports to his player
2006-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	guess so. can be hard if he already owns one that doesn't
2006-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	that's an option, but takes time and degrades quality
2006-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	well either he gets a new one, or he lives with poorer quality.. Not much you can do with inferior file formats
2006-03-12T15:47:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	;p
2006-03-12T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	well if he has the files as MP3 to begin with, the quality won't suffer. it might still be inferior to an Ogg, but it'll definitely be much better than Ogg->mp3
2006-07-21T07:01:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	I like to keep my windows apps separated anyway
2006-11-25T12:45:00.000Z	polpak	LjL	except that /usr/local/share has the same requirements /usr/share does, and /usr/share is supposed to be read only (ideally)
2006-11-25T12:45:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	well, if you "ideally" assume that your music collection is not changing ;)
2006-11-25T12:46:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	after all, all of /usr is changing when you install programs. so, you can see adding new music just as you see installing new programs
2006-11-25T12:47:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	and while on debian-style systems you're really not supposed to touch /usr, /usr/local is an exception
2006-11-25T12:47:00.000Z	LjL	polpak	hmm, i'm really not sure that the location of a music library should depend on what program you're using to listen to it :-\
