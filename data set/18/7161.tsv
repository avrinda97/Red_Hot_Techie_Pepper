2008-01-30T16:24:00.000Z	schmakk		if i just get restricted drivers, x works, but then i cant run 1600x1200
2008-01-30T16:24:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	ati drivers?
2008-01-30T16:24:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	yes.
2008-01-30T16:25:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	there was one with the widescreen bug that reset maximum resolution to 1280x1024. they release one a week or two ago that fixed this, however i'd not heard of your problem.
2008-01-30T16:26:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	1280x1024 isnt my max res, 1600x1200 is just missing. it goes all the way up to 19xx 17xx something something
2008-01-30T16:26:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	im still waiting for them to fix their opengl implementation; trying to use 'opengl' with vlc does not work, everything else gives me jerky video when hardware 3d acceleration is on.
2008-01-30T16:26:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	are the entries in xorg.conf?
2008-01-30T16:27:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	i tried checking, but i never bothered till it was too late. entried are there, but at the time i checked, ubuntu booted in a resolution my monitor could take at all. entries went up to 2kx2k stuff
2008-01-30T16:29:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	try manually editing them in a console? sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2008-01-30T16:29:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	that does sound a bit messed up. had a similar problem upgrading nvidia drivers about 8 years ago. that was one of the major reasons i went off linux that long.
2008-01-30T16:29:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	tried, but i can only see the top left half of the screen. like console is written with a way too big font or something. and no, i dont know how to correct that with commands
2008-01-30T16:30:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	you could try booting off the liveCD and editing from there.
2008-01-30T16:30:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	i did, but eventually i just gave up and nuked the partition with ubuntu. igot frustrated that even gui stuff didnt work :)
2008-01-30T16:30:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	try downgrading to a previous ati driver?
2008-01-30T16:30:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	problem solved then?
2008-01-30T16:31:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	solved in the sense that i have no ubuntu, but windows. some of the eyecandy i saw with a fresh gutsy install was really nice
2008-01-30T16:31:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	schmakk	eyecandy is one of the major reasons i zapped vista and xp.
2008-01-30T16:32:00.000Z	schmakk	L3ttuc3	come on, its the only pr0n nerds get! besides, it can be useful, like how it looks when you switch desktop and stuff
