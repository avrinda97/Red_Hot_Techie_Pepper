2005-09-25T07:02:00.000Z	alec_		Can someone help explain how to get GNOME Bittorrent working?
2005-09-25T07:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	are you running Firestarter? If so, you need to open the BT ports
2005-09-25T07:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	Firestarter is a firewall manager, not a browser
2005-09-25T07:05:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	Okay I don't thyink I have it
2005-09-25T07:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	OK. Firestarter isn't installed by default
2005-09-25T07:06:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	Ok
2005-09-25T07:06:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	So what do I do?
2005-09-25T07:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	no idea; BT works for me, but there do seem to be a lot of defunct torrents out there that don't actually work...
2005-09-25T07:07:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	Wait...
2005-09-25T07:07:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	When I open the BT
2005-09-25T07:08:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	It asks for the BT Meta file
2005-09-25T07:08:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	What do I do there?
2005-09-25T07:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	you need to have the .torrent file on your HD already, from the net somewhere
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	What's a good website.
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	alec_	Madpilot	Wasn't there like suprnova.org
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	if you're just testing, try and see if you can get one of the Ubuntu isos down by BT - they're legal...
2005-09-26T08:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	alec_	do you have the Universe/Multiverse repos enabled?
