2012-08-19T09:23:00.000Z	Elesa		That's what my friend gets.
2012-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	Elesa		I'm not sure what we should do there.
2012-08-19T09:24:00.000Z	Elesa		/dev/sda is her internal HDD. /dev/sdc is the external one where we want to install Ubuntu.
2012-08-19T09:25:00.000Z	Elesa		Or you might try installing MATE. But I'd use Xubuntu.
2012-08-19T09:27:00.000Z	Elesa		But.. The /dev/sda won't be formatted or anything? I don't want to be responsible for a terrible mistake. x_x
2012-08-19T09:27:00.000Z	Elesa		She has to select the Format? checkbox, right?
