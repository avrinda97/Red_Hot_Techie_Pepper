2007-07-23T12:18:00.000Z	Pilana		hmm ok. Is there any way to get wine on a computer with out having that computer connected to the net?
2007-07-23T12:18:00.000Z	Pilana		... what the what? :p
2007-07-23T12:19:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Download and copy the necessary .deb files to cd, copy them over to the internet-less box. then use dpkg -i <packagename> to install them
2007-07-23T12:19:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	np
2007-07-23T12:57:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Are you still trying to install wine on a compuyter with no internet?
2007-07-23T12:57:00.000Z	Pilana	genii	I tried that dpkg thing but it said it couldn't find it
2007-07-23T13:00:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Are you using a linux or windoze box to download the packages from the internet?
2007-07-23T13:01:00.000Z	Pilana	genii	win, then a usb thumbdrive to transfer
2007-07-23T13:01:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	OK, and on the computer it is going to, what version of ubuntu is it? Dapper, edgy feisty etc
2007-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Back. Get any help yet? If not, go: !info wine <my ubuntu distname>     where distname is what ubuntu you have like dapper,edgy or feisty. then go in the windoze box top http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wine/ and download the version which it says is for your dist. then copy that to your usb stick and you should be able to copy it over then install it to the ubuntu box by: sudo dpkg -i <packagename>
2007-07-23T13:28:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Did you get all that?
2007-07-23T13:28:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Back. Get any help yet? If not, go: !info wine <my ubuntu distname>     where distname is what ubuntu you have like dapper,edgy or feisty. then go in the windoze box top http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wine/ and download the version which it says is for your dist. then copy that to your usb stick and you should be able to copy it over then install it to the ubuntu box by: sudo dpkg -i <packagename>
2007-07-23T13:28:00.000Z	Pilana	genii	when I try dpkg it says that package does not exist
2007-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Copy the file you downloaded, like  wine_0.9.33-0ubuntu1_i386.deb  for instance, into /home/yourusername     then go to a terminal and put: cd ~  then: sudo dpkg -i wine_0.9.33-0ubuntu1_i386.deb      (if that was the exact name of the package you had for instance)
2007-07-23T13:37:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	Then it's going to be a real headache without getting that box online
2007-07-23T13:39:00.000Z	genii	Pilana	You could hook it up temporarily, long enough to install the things you may need then disconnect it
