2008-05-11T17:54:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	you can set bashrc to export DATE=`date +"%d"`, or anything like that
2008-05-11T17:55:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	where would I find bashrc?
2008-05-11T17:56:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	its in your home folder, ~/.bashrc
2008-05-11T17:58:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	i pasted that line in, now how would I refer to the date in a shell script?
2008-05-11T17:58:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	now just run that .bashrc one
2008-05-11T18:00:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	I tried sudo ./.bashrc and this shows "sudo: ./.bashrc: command not found"
2008-05-11T18:04:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	I tried sudo ./.bashrc and this shows "sudo: ./.bashrc: command not found"
2008-05-11T18:04:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	no, you need to be in your  home directory first to execute that command
2008-05-11T18:05:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	oh sorry, yes jrib is right
2008-05-11T18:06:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	I got it working now how would I refer to it in a parameter of a shell script
2008-05-11T18:07:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	oh ok thank  you
2008-05-11T18:09:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	is there a way to set the month name and time to $MONTH and $TIME
2008-05-11T18:09:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	yes offcourse what i wrote is just for date
2008-05-11T18:10:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	see the man page for date,"man date" and just use the parameters you want
2008-05-11T18:10:00.000Z	linkmaster03	binarycodes	thank you
2008-05-11T18:11:00.000Z	binarycodes	linkmaster03	for example export DATE=`date +"%d.%m.%Y"`
