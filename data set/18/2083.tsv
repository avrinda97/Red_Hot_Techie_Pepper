2010-09-09T03:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Is there no OS on the internal drive?
2010-09-09T03:38:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	been wiped from the initial install of Ubuntu i believe
2010-09-09T03:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Ok, so there should be an Ubuntu install there but that isn't booting. And the media that you used to do that install before, isn't booting now. Correct?
2010-09-09T03:39:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	correct
2010-09-09T03:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Does anything change if you hold boot when trying to boot from the internal drive?
2010-09-09T03:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	*hold shift
2010-09-09T03:40:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	nothing until it starts beeping
2010-09-09T03:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Beeping is good, somewhere in the documentation there should be information on what various beep patterns mean.
2010-09-09T03:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	The documentation for your netbook that is.
2010-09-09T03:43:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	it is just an old IBM Thinkpad rather than a Netbook and I believe the beeping is just from it believe the shift key is stuck
2010-09-09T03:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Did you get that beeping when it was booting successfully?
2010-09-09T03:48:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	never held shift when it was booting successfully to Windows XP Pro
2010-09-09T03:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Ok, so it doesn't beep when it fails to boot but you're not holding shift.
2010-09-09T03:49:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	Indeed
2010-09-09T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	Can you completely remove the internal HD from the boot order?
2010-09-09T03:55:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	No i don't believe that is an option. I an put it last in line but that is about it.
2010-09-09T03:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Boreum	I can't think of any thing not hardware related that would cause the LiveCD that booted before to no longer do so, and I expect whatever is preventing the LiveCD from working is also what's preventing the internal HD from booting.
2010-09-09T04:01:00.000Z	Boreum	Jordan_U	I created the LiveCD after using unetbootin to trial Ubuntu Netbook Edition and install. So I am not quite sure the LiveCD ever worked?
