2009-03-16T14:07:00.000Z	SmokeyD		hey eveyone. I am using Ubuntu intrepid, english version . I have some russian music with file and folder names in Cyrillic alphabet
2009-03-16T14:07:00.000Z	SmokeyD		they are displayed correctly in nautilus, but Amarok makes a mess of the artist and album names
2009-03-16T14:08:00.000Z	SmokeyD		any clue why amarok doesn't display them correctly?
2009-03-16T14:08:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	you probably have to convert them from windows-1251 into utf-8
2009-03-16T14:08:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	the id3 tags? How could I do that?
2009-03-16T14:10:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	install python-mutagen package, and run the following command in the directory with music: 'find ./ -iname '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -0 mid3iconv -e CP1251 --remove-v1'
2009-03-16T14:10:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	I know, it doesn't look good, but this is the fastest may, imho
2009-03-16T14:11:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	thanks a lot\
2009-03-16T14:11:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	Not at all. You may try it in a separate directory first.
2009-03-16T14:12:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	just in case, although it always worked for me
2009-03-16T14:12:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	:) I have a backup of the music
2009-03-16T14:15:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	:) I've actually created a small script called convtags, and put it in the search path. So, not I merely have to go to the new music directory, and run the convtags command. Now my tags are displayed correctly everywhere.
2009-03-16T14:24:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	you are a hero :) Just converted the id3 tags of 1.7GB of mp3's
2009-03-16T14:25:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	Great! :)
2009-03-16T14:26:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	Hehe, use translate.google.com or your friends to read it. After all, it's not that difficult to learn the language yourself. =)
2009-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	I understand Ленинград, but what is Наркоман :)
2009-03-16T14:33:00.000Z	macrobad	SmokeyD	Наркоман is a drug addict. Btw, Ленинград's songs are full of obscene lexics... just in case.
2009-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	SmokeyD	macrobad	ok, They just sound very nice. I am just finding out the lyrics with translate.google.com :)
