2004-12-08T12:54:00.000Z	Rod		hello
2004-12-08T12:55:00.000Z	Rod		i have problems getting on internet with the life cd.. Yesterday I got some commands of someone here on IRC to run to analyse the problem... Would you like the output of lsmod and ifconfig -a?
2004-12-08T12:56:00.000Z	Rod		the network cards are detected, but still no internte wile I have a simple dhcp setup up... Windows, Gentoo and FC work flawlessly :-/
2004-12-08T12:57:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	throw the output of lsmod and ifconfig -a into the #flood channel, and I'll take a look at them.
2004-12-08T13:06:00.000Z	Rod	pdaoust	are you still here?
2004-12-08T14:09:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	how's it going?
2004-12-08T14:09:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	thought so; I think the problem goes deeper
2004-12-08T14:10:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	kinda slow acceleration in my opinion
2004-12-08T14:10:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	that's weird
2004-12-08T14:10:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	any problems with LiveCDs (or have you tried them?)
2004-12-08T14:11:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	yeah, maybe the nforce3 drivers are just too young and buggy yet...
2004-12-08T14:11:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	oh, if the LiveCD works, that's weird
2004-12-08T14:11:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	indeed
2004-12-08T14:11:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	but maybe it's using the vesafb drivers?
2004-12-08T14:17:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	yeah, I was thinking you'd still have problems with that.
2004-12-08T14:18:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	you were having problems loading it, weren't you
2004-12-08T14:18:00.000Z	Rod	pdaoust	only on debian it gave me an error.. on ubuntu it doesnt give me any output, which is good i think
2004-12-08T14:19:00.000Z	pdaoust	Rod	that's interesting... I hope that's good :)
