2007-01-27T11:19:00.000Z	Stormx2		I need a good app for writing algebraic formulae out. Any suggestions?
2007-01-27T11:21:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	Latex?
2007-01-27T11:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	I'll try it
2007-01-27T11:21:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	It's a markup language, not a program per se
2007-01-27T11:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	Ah. Well I just need to write em and save em as images, really....
2007-01-27T11:22:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	You can do that with Latex but it might be more complicated than you need... How many equations are you writing?
2007-01-27T11:23:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	You might try this http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html
2007-01-27T11:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	Quite a few. I'm doing some maths coursework, and I just need to write out stuff in a clear format, rather than using say (blahblahblah/blahblahblah)... use two lines, instead of the /, see?
2007-01-27T11:24:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	What document format are you writing in currently?
2007-01-27T11:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	Just an office document. Probably save using the OOo format. I can just take screenshots and import them as images...
2007-01-27T11:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	I don't know what country you're from, but I'm from the UK and studying for GCSEs. I'm 15. Just to give you a kind of judge of what level I'm working at.
2007-01-27T11:26:00.000Z	Stormx2		Thanks variant
2007-01-27T11:28:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	Thanks, that helps. I OO has an equation editor that should be sufficient for you
2007-01-27T11:29:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	If you need GIFs for some reason you can use that webapp I linked to previously.
2007-01-27T11:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	Oh, really?! Wow.
2007-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	Insert-> Object -> Formula
2007-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	soothsay	Ah! Okay! Thanks so much for all the help!
2007-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	soothsay	Stormx2	Sure.
