2008-04-16T01:09:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Did anyone notice that writing an email in Thunderbird will show the Netscape icon on the upleft corner of the window?
2008-04-16T01:10:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Oh, MrObviousk, I am using Xubuntu.
2008-04-16T01:10:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	I don't know what kind of an icon that is but I know I'm not getting the kind of icon I'm expecting to see
2008-04-16T01:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	looks kinda netscapy though
2008-04-16T01:11:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Myrtti	GNOME, KDE or Xfce?
2008-04-16T01:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	gnome
2008-04-16T01:11:00.000Z	LetsGo67		It's green-blue on the top, grey on the bottom.  That's most definitively Netscape.
2008-04-16T01:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	though I've got my thunderbird from mozilla site, not from ubuntu repos, you?
2008-04-16T01:12:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Myrtti	came with Xubuntu.  Good luck!  (You have x on your server?  You use a server?)

2008-04-16T01:13:00.000Z	LetsGo67		GO POLICYKIT!  JUST LIKE VISTA!
2008-04-16T01:13:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	I think that's the exactly same that I see too, then
2008-04-16T01:13:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	hold your horses
2008-04-16T01:14:00.000Z	Myrtti		!enter | thorax
2008-04-16T01:14:00.000Z	LetsGo67		They should compress the reps, it'd be way faster and would give 'em more bandwidth.
2008-04-16T01:14:00.000Z	Myrtti	LetsGo67	the packages in the repos are compressed
2008-04-16T01:15:00.000Z	LetsGo67	Myrtti	a little bit.  It's still slow on dial-up/lite high speed
