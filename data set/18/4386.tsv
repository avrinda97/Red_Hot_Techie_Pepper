2009-10-13T18:12:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		anyone here understand XML files?
2009-10-13T18:13:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		I need to restore XML, on external drive, to my C: drive. I'm now running Ubuntu from D: drive
2009-10-13T18:14:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		no, I want to restore the contents, it has a full Windows installation on it, should restore drive to the time when I backed up
2009-10-13T18:15:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		coz, I re-installed windows but can't restore from file because I'm using C: drive...
2009-10-13T18:15:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		yes
2009-10-13T18:15:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		I used ImageDrive XML
2009-10-13T18:16:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		coz, yes, but because I'm running Windows from same drive I can't restore to it. I hoped to do that from Ubuntu with equivalent program
2009-10-13T18:17:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		coz, Ubuntu is on drive D:
2009-10-13T18:18:00.000Z	gravityreloaded		I really do like Ubuntu but there are some things that can only be done with Windows
2009-10-13T18:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	which is not the case for what you are describing, you can easily backup a partition with partimage
2009-10-13T18:19:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	that software maybe compatible with other COMERCIAL software, which doesn't turn into an open standard
2009-10-13T18:19:00.000Z	gravityreloaded	joaopinto	I HAVE the backup, I need to restore it
2009-10-13T18:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	so just ask the software authors to port their software to linux, please do not attribute the fault to Ubuntu :)
2009-10-13T18:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	let me repeat, there is no standard format for disk images using XML, your question is nout about ubuntu, is how to restore XML files geneated by a specific disk cloning app
2009-10-13T18:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	coudl you elaborate on that ? which bug and which missing feature is blocking use from using partimage ?
2009-10-13T18:24:00.000Z	gravityreloaded	joaopinto	can partimage recover an XML file?
2009-10-13T18:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	gravityreloaded	no, it does not support non standard images generated by random clone imaging products
