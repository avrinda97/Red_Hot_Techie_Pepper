2009-09-09T19:17:00.000Z	gigglefight		thanks :)
2009-09-09T19:18:00.000Z	gigglefight		will do. but then my next question: is it possible to return to mac os x 10.5 from ubuntu?
2009-09-09T19:18:00.000Z	gigglefight		just curious.
2009-09-09T19:20:00.000Z	gigglefight		ragidweezle: how so?
2009-09-09T19:21:00.000Z	gigglefight		downloading 9.04 for PowerPC at the moment.
2009-09-09T19:21:00.000Z	gigglefight		I didn't buy this mac. LOL.
2009-09-09T19:21:00.000Z	gigglefight		I inherited it... eww.
2009-09-09T19:23:00.000Z	gigglefight		I'd like to preform miracles. Is it possible to install Ubuntu 9.04 then Mac OS again. (possible leopard)
2009-09-09T19:23:00.000Z	gigglefight		I installed ubuntu just to undo the password junk that mac os gives me.
2009-09-09T19:23:00.000Z	gigglefight		on mac?
2009-09-09T19:24:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	if you have the OS X disc - it's easy to install it.
2009-09-09T19:32:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	Is the G4 using an Intel CPU?
2009-09-09T19:33:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	Wine only emulates the Windows APIs, not the entire CPU. If you don't have an x86 CPU, Wine won't work. (Or at least I highly doubt it will work.)
2009-09-09T19:34:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	uname -a will tell
2009-09-09T19:35:00.000Z	gigglefight	grawity	please explain...
2009-09-09T19:35:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	Unix-based systems (including OS X) have 'uname' command.
2009-09-09T19:35:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	And, learn to use tab-completion on IRC :)
2009-12-19T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	gigglefight	Extract it, then look for a file named "README" or "INSTALL" in its contents.
