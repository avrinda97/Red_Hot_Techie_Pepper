2007-03-03T07:29:00.000Z	BigMac		Hey, I just ndiswrapper'd my wifi card and it seemed to be working, but I can't seem to configure it to connect to my windows network? Can someone tell me what to do?
2007-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	AndrewB	BigMac	try using an application like wlassistant
2007-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	BigMac	AndrewB	I will try it, I downloaded wifi radar and it says I am connected, but when I unplug my ethernet cable I can't connect to any websites
2007-03-03T07:31:00.000Z	AndrewB	BigMac	does iwconfig show an ip next to the interfact, or ifconfig
2007-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	BigMac	AndrewB	Sorry, I am unfamiliar with those terms
2007-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	AndrewB	BigMac	do   sudo ifconfig   from a terminal and paste it on pastebin.ca
2007-03-03T07:32:00.000Z	BigMac	AndrewB	wlassistant is for kde
2007-03-03T07:33:00.000Z	AndrewB	BigMac	it is.. but I think it is possibly the best even when working on gnome.

2007-03-03T07:46:00.000Z	BigMac	AndrewB	The wlanassistant says I am connected
2007-03-03T07:47:00.000Z	AndrewB	BigMac	very strange indeed.
