2011-12-08T01:12:00.000Z	diatomaceous		Uh.. I have no sound hardware all of a sudden.  Completely empty in Sound - Hardware. Ubuntu 11.10, dell precision M6600.. never had any problems until this boot-up.  Any advice?
2011-12-08T01:13:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	can you pastebin the output of dmesg
2011-12-08T01:13:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	sure
2011-12-08T01:15:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	the second one is a  graphics error, but the first one indicates that your v ideo card's hdmi out's sound was recognised
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	I don't have speakers on my hdmi output
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	I just want the internal sound card and speakers to work
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	and they've been fine until today
2011-12-08T01:21:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	sounds like pulse audio messed up
2011-12-08T01:22:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	there is alsa, which is the actual sound system, then pulse audio which is a layer on top that some software uses
2011-12-08T01:25:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	if its still not showing hw in some apps, try restarting the pulse audio daemon
2011-12-08T01:25:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	how do i do that
2011-12-08T01:40:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	yes i did actually
2011-12-08T01:41:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	dont know how to do it on pidgin, but others like irssi support it
2011-12-08T01:42:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	pidgin is pretty bare when it comes to setting, i suggest trying clients designed for irc specificly.
2011-12-08T01:47:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	thats what #ubuntu-offtopic is all about, just switch channels when this one is too much :P
2011-12-08T01:50:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	the binary drivers are usually faster and can do better pm
2011-12-08T01:51:00.000Z	diatomaceous	riffautae	right, but there are no proprietary linux drivers for the mobility firepro cards yet
2011-12-08T01:52:00.000Z	riffautae	diatomaceous	ah dunno then
