2009-05-27T03:26:00.000Z	Sir-Integra		hey, when i turn my volume down, i get the window popup that shows the volume
2009-05-27T03:26:00.000Z	Sir-Integra		how do i get rid of it?
2009-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	Sir-Integra		since it causes fullscreen windows to close
2009-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	i think you should right-click on the sound icon in the top bar, then choose the prefs/settings
2009-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	actually, no "open volume control..."
2009-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	Sir-Integra	bernz	has no option for settings under preferences.
2009-05-27T03:28:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	hm... i'm thinking of something else... must be a different way to do it... i'll think for a bit
2009-05-27T03:28:00.000Z	Sir-Integra	bernz	okay.
2009-05-27T03:33:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	i'm sorry, i can't recall the trick, but try searching for "GNOME OSD" and or "Ubuntu" with that, and you might find some starting points
2009-05-27T03:34:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	but in the interest of learning, i'm going to search as well :-)
2009-05-27T03:35:00.000Z	Sir-Integra	bernz	yeah, it could be something to do with compiz aswell i'm not sure, though.
2009-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	i did 'ps aux | grep osd' for the hell of it, and i found something interesting: 'notify-osd'... i'll look into that; simply killing it should stop the OSD activity, but it might be to hamfisted to do that, so don't try it just yet :-D
2009-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	Sir-Integra	bernz	i seen that too.
2009-05-27T03:39:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	okay, so "unfortunately", you'll probably have to learn a fair bit about it, and edit its settings to remove the ones you don't want (sound-related) ... :-)
2009-05-27T03:40:00.000Z	Sir-Integra	bernz	notify-osd isn't running on my system
2009-05-27T03:40:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	and still you're getting the osd-like behavior? (sparklies when you change volume?)
2009-05-27T03:41:00.000Z	bernz	Sir-Integra	cool
