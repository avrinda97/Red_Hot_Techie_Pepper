2006-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	rbond		Question: I am really having a strange problem with Mplayer. The problem is that when I use XV acceleration the video will play slowly. The video does not appear to be choppy. I have verified that I have updated my ATI drivers to 3D acceleration via fglrxinfo. Also xvinfo shows my adapter being listed. The machine has been restarted as well. Can anyone please tell me what is going on?
2006-07-30T12:54:00.000Z	rbond		also to add to my question glxgears runs between 6000-7500 fps

2006-07-30T12:57:00.000Z	magnus87	rbond	- is it with all video files?  what about a different video player
2006-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	rbond	magnus87	yes all files. VLC will work perfectly
2006-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	magnus87		so its just mplayer?  hmm...
2006-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	rbond	magnus87	yeah it is the strangest thing
2006-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	rbond	magnus87	Now something I will notice about VLC is that sometimes the sound will turn off intermittently
2006-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	magnus87		what is your default sound audio device in mplayer > preferences > audio?
2006-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	rbond		if I can get that problem out of the way, then I will integrate VLC with mozilla
2006-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	magnus87		it could have to do with that....
2006-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	rbond		checking...
2006-07-30T13:00:00.000Z	rbond	magnus87	ALSA
2006-07-30T13:00:00.000Z	rbond		and default for devices
2006-07-30T13:01:00.000Z	magnus87	rbond	- got me then, im not sure, unless the codecs arent install properly
2006-07-30T13:02:00.000Z	rbond	magnus87	I know what you are saying. I don't believe that it is the codecs as it works perfectly on other players. I think I am going to stick with VLC and integrated the plugin into mozilla
