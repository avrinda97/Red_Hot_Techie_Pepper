2010-07-05T05:31:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	driver for what?
2010-07-05T05:32:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	what make & model is the computer and/or the network card?
2010-07-05T05:33:00.000Z	Haxor	squircle	acer asprie 5517 and the network is atheros ar8132
2010-07-05T05:34:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	let me check the compatibility; gimme a minute
2010-07-05T05:34:00.000Z	Haxor	squircle	ok
2010-07-05T05:39:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	to confirm, it's wired, not wireless, correct?
2010-07-05T05:40:00.000Z	Haxor	squircle	sure is wired
2010-07-05T05:43:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	I see that there may be a few wireless issues with that computer, but I don't know about the wired, I'll keep looking but you may want to search the forums
2010-07-05T05:43:00.000Z	Haxor	squircle	the "lshw -C network" command says that im using the driver atl1c but how can i load that driver into the minimal cd ?
2010-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	I took a look, and I don't think that the minimal cd has that kernel module/driver...
2010-07-05T05:46:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	that's pretty much the limit of my expertise, sorry
2010-07-05T05:47:00.000Z	Haxor	squircle	dont worry thanks =) i going to googleit
2010-07-05T05:47:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	actually, before you leave...
2010-07-05T05:48:00.000Z	squircle	Haxor	it appears that the ath9k driver should support both your wired & wireless cards in that computer. i would try using that when booted into the minimal cd
