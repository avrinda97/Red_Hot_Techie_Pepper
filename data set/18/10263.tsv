2007-03-04T07:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	1.5  so he's using the stable version
2007-03-04T07:50:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	OK.
2007-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	April
2007-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	19.04.
2007-03-04T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	i thought it was 7.04... so i couldn't remember which number signified the month..
2007-03-04T07:59:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	;)
2007-03-04T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	it seems awful unstable for only being a month out.
2007-03-04T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	after the 17hr adventure i had setting up dual monitors, i don't think i'm ever gonna upgrade from Edgy...lol
2007-03-04T08:00:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	Oh boy...
2007-03-04T08:00:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	I don't know if I'll upgrade. Right now things are running so smoothly here...
2007-03-04T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	thing is, i got it working in about 45min, but i couldn't get it how i wanted, thrashed xorg.conf about 50x..lol
2007-03-04T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	yeah, i agree... i'll wait a month or so to upgrade
2007-03-04T08:05:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	;) But maybe indeed an alternative client will solve that problem for the time being...
2007-03-04T08:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	i think so, looks ike its a gaim issue.. I'm not having any issues at all though with Yahoo via gaim 2.0.0 b3.1
2007-03-04T08:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	from looking at that link, it looks like that bug has been hanging around a bit, wonder why its not fixed yet
2007-03-04T08:13:00.000Z	paradroid	IndyGunFreak	I'm not really any wiser now after having read up on that... in one place someone suggests changing servers... in another it's about visibility of the contacts...
2007-03-04T08:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	yeah,
2007-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	paradroid	like i said, i never even knew it existed...  sudo works for me
