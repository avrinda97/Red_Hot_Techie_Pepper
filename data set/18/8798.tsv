2007-06-26T13:23:00.000Z	MrOtacon		hey guys - is it possible to build a livecd from my installed ubuntu system? i want to give my mate one so he can run something called kai - but on livecd - i have it all compiled and running on my system - he isn't very computer literate so i want to make it easy for him
2007-06-26T13:24:00.000Z	imbecile	MrOtacon	 make a vm of it and he can do it that way
2007-06-26T13:24:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	he wont want to or know how to use vmware in windows
2007-06-26T13:25:00.000Z	imbecile	MrOtacon	 he doesnt know how to open a vmx file?
2007-06-26T13:26:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	nope... i thought a live cd would be the easiest for him - cause then i could setup the rc.local to run everything he needs - he would only have to enter his username and password in kai
2007-06-26T13:29:00.000Z	imbecile	MrOtacon	 what i'm saying is YOU can make the vm for him with all the modules he needs already installed and send it to him or burn as a  data disk and just pull it over to his hd then "voila" he has the preconfigured vm.. the only thing he has to do is "open" and select the .vmx
2007-06-26T13:30:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	yeah - i could do that i suppose... i just didn;t want him to have to install anything
2007-06-26T13:32:00.000Z	imbecile	MrOtacon	I think in the long run it will be easier for him.. heck you can even throw vmware setup on the same disk as your vmx so he wont have to look around for stuff.. my 63yo dad had no problem when i did the same for him
2007-06-26T13:32:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	ok :) - thanks for the advice - i think i'll go down that route then
2007-06-27T08:21:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	get bchunk - then use "bchunk file.cue file.bin file.iso" and it will convert it to iso - then mount with "mount -t iso9660 -o loop file.iso /media/cdrom"
2007-06-27T09:13:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-06-27T09:14:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	add -3g after the ntfs there, so it becomes ntfs-3g
2007-06-27T09:14:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	then save (make sure ro isn't listed as an option)
2007-06-27T09:14:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	then sudo umount -a, then sudo mount -a
2007-06-27T09:15:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	now you can write to it
2007-06-27T09:17:00.000Z	imbecile	MrOtacon	 its telling me the device is busy
2007-06-27T09:17:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	you have to close anything using the directory and leave it also - so just goto your home folder in xterminal or something and make sure anything accessing stuff on it is closed
2007-06-27T09:17:00.000Z	MrOtacon	imbecile	then it will work - or at least should
