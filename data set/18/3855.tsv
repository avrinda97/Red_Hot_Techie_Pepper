2010-06-25T10:45:00.000Z	Joshmuffin	zer010	I would suggest 6-10 gib, if /home is a seperate partition
2010-06-25T10:46:00.000Z	Joshmuffin	zer010	if /home is not on a separate partition / should be 6-10 + however much you need for movies music ect.
2010-06-25T10:47:00.000Z	Joshmuffin	zer010	/ should be around 6 or 8 in that case
2010-06-25T10:47:00.000Z	Joshmuffin	zer010	/home should be the rest
