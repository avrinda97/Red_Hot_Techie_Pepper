2010-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	I see a google appliance and I see an enterprise search.
2010-05-18T21:02:00.000Z	resno	cfedde_	oh, you arent being clear about your needs.
2010-05-18T21:02:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	probably not.  I;ll put together a needs analisys and submit it for review.
2010-05-18T21:02:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	but thanks for the help.
2010-05-18T21:03:00.000Z	resno	cfedde_	i dont understand why you cant lock down the netowkr
2010-05-18T21:03:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	I think we might be talking at cross purposes.
2010-05-18T21:04:00.000Z	resno	cfedde_	which is why i dont understand
2010-05-18T21:06:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	maybe google has some feature that can be used to index our "intranet" websites without letting them be public.  I'm not familiar with those.
2010-05-18T21:06:00.000Z	resno	cfedde_	ah, you are asking about your intranet LOL
2010-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	I agree that I was not clear.
2010-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	resno	cfedde_	do you have some type of website or files you are sharing?
2010-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	cfedde_	resno	thanks for all your comments.  I'll go look for myself.
