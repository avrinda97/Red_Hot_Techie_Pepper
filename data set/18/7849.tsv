2007-11-05T21:29:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	whats up
2007-11-05T21:30:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	i just installed ubuntu on my computer, and upon logging into it for the first time, i had my data partition mounted on the desktop with a really nice hard drive icon, but after i installed my video card drivers and some updates and then restarted the system, that same icon became an ugly old fat drive icon...why did this happen?
2007-11-05T21:31:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	ati graphics driver?
2007-11-05T21:31:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	no, nvidia
2007-11-05T21:31:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	remove the driver and see if it bings it back
2007-11-05T21:32:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	but i remove the driver then my video performance will decrease
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	ok then change the icon manually
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	can you instruct me on how to do that
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	its easy right clicnt on the icon you want to change and hit properties
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	okay, and which location is the place where all the icons are kept in ubuntu?
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	the click on the icon in the properties menu
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	it will default to that location
2007-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	it doesn't :/
2007-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	toxicfume	Alyxander	it just takes me to the desktop when i browse for the icon
2007-11-05T21:37:00.000Z	Alyxander	toxicfume	either /usr/share/pixmaps or /usr/share/icons/
