2005-10-04T16:53:00.000Z	Feles		hello all, in need of a little help here
2005-10-04T16:54:00.000Z	Feles		I tried installing Ubuntu on a box that already had Windows XP on it, and decided to quit once it came to the formatting of partitions... (quitting the installer completely,) but now I can't boot back into Win XP
2005-10-04T16:54:00.000Z	Feles		no
2005-10-04T16:55:00.000Z	Feles		I said to "forget" all the changes to the partitions
2005-10-04T16:55:00.000Z	Feles		and no
2005-10-04T16:55:00.000Z	Feles		I told it not to touch the windows partition
2005-10-04T16:56:00.000Z	Feles		Actually I told it to "forget" the changes, then I Ctrl-Alt-Del'd out of the installer
2005-10-04T05:04:00.000Z	Feles		hrm.... logging into the repair console and typing FIXMBR didn't seem to work
2005-10-04T05:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	go to bootdisk.com and get you a win98 boot cd image
2005-10-04T05:08:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	it's there (any windows 9x boot floppy image will work)
2005-10-04T05:17:00.000Z	Feles	nalioth	I... can't seem to find CD images ... I can find floppy images... but I don't have floppy drives on both computers
2005-10-04T05:17:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	got a livecd?
2005-10-04T05:18:00.000Z	Feles	nalioth	of ubuntu? yes?
2005-10-04T05:18:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	load it and fdisk /mbr
2005-10-04T05:25:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	use sudo?
2005-10-04T05:26:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	the missing floppy drive is gonna be the death of us all
2005-10-04T05:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	waht was your original question? i just assumed you wanted to clean your /mbr
2005-10-04T05:31:00.000Z	nalioth	Feles	cleaning the /mbr will bring back a windows only system
