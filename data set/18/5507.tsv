2009-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	you'll want to transcode the vob files into an avi. e.g. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-rip-DVDs-for-free-with-VLC/
2009-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	thank you I will take a look
2009-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	seems those instructions are for VLC Windows and don't seem to have the same options in my VLC
2009-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	well actually I'd use dvd::rip if you have the dvd...
2009-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	I do but after ripping, the transcode button is greyed out
2009-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	if you can guide me a little I would appreciate it
2009-09-17T06:59:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	that's weird. Did you use the 'copy dvd to harddisk before encoding' option?
2009-09-17T06:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	I don't think I did
2009-09-17T07:00:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	it uses more space (and time) but I found dvdrip doesn't always work with the 'encode on the fly' option. Er, `how did you get the 8 vob files?
2009-09-17T07:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	correction yes I did copy to hard disk
2009-09-17T07:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	ok so I have the .vob files now what?
2009-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	handbrake is a possible option too, but so is ffmpeg, mencoder or transcode.
2009-09-17T07:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	think I got it going.
2009-09-17T07:03:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	did you change the encoding options? Not all combinations are valid...
2009-09-17T07:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	I went with the default
2009-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	once you get it going, you can experiment with different settings (if you have the patience)...
2009-09-17T07:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	losher	well I just want to get this dvd ripped and will take it from there :)
2009-09-17T07:08:00.000Z	losher	IdleOne	Understood. Since it takes ages to transcode a full dvd, you can experiment with transcoding short sections of the dvd quickly to see what effect different settings have by using the 'frame range' under 'general options' in the transcode tab. A range might be e.g. 1000 to 2000 is 1000 frames i.e. about 30 seconds of video....
