2012-01-13T18:48:00.000Z	boba88		hi i have  the following problem do_wait: drmWaitVBlank returned -1, IRQs don't seem to be working correctly.
2012-01-13T18:48:00.000Z	boba88		anyone has any idea about this problem
2012-01-13T18:48:00.000Z	boba88		?
2012-01-13T18:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	boba88	 is that a question about programming, development?
2012-01-13T18:49:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	i try to run rosrun rviz rviz a ros node
2012-01-13T18:49:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	i try to run "rosrun rviz rviz" a ros node
2012-01-13T18:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	boba88	 and what is that?
2012-01-13T18:50:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	it is ros (robot operating system) node available for visualizing different things
2012-01-13T18:51:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	i want to visualize the point cloud from kinect
2012-01-13T18:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	boba88	 i guess you did not come to the right place
2012-01-13T18:52:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	its possible but i thought it has to do with my setup, because this same node works on another computer of mine but different versions of ros
2012-01-13T18:52:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	thanks anyway
2012-01-13T18:52:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	:)
2012-01-13T18:56:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	what about this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1412915? I wonder if there is another way of fixing this error with the vblank_mode
2012-01-13T18:57:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	the actual error is do_wait: drmWaitVBlank returned -1, IRQs don't seem to be working correctly. Try adjusting the vblank_mode configuration parameter.
2012-01-13T18:57:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	boba88	 doesnt ring a bell, cant help
2012-01-13T18:58:00.000Z	boba88	MonkeyDust	it seems it has to do with this computer ubuntu setup :) but not sure how to fix it :)
2012-02-28T15:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	boba88	 basically, you need sudo for anything outside /home
