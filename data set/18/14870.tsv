2007-04-17T15:10:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	thank you
2007-04-17T15:17:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	that sounds like it oughta be a factoid in the bot
2007-04-17T15:39:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	I wasn't offering advice, I was telling him what was going on.
2007-04-17T15:39:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	that's not true.
2007-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	why not?
2007-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	from a windows box they could connect without having to type that
2007-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	using realvnc on windows, for example, they would connect using <his ip>:5900
2007-04-17T15:40:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	maybe i missed something. i think he speaks about another linux box
2007-04-17T15:41:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	maybe he does, but you said the peer *has* to use xvncviewer.  they don't.
2007-04-17T15:41:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	:0 mean the x display number, not the port
2007-04-17T15:41:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	they can use any vnc viewer which will connect on port 5900
2007-04-17T15:41:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	display :0 is port 5900, display :1 is port 5901, display :x is port (5900+x).
2007-04-17T15:42:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	thank you. didn't knew that
2007-04-18T16:02:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	it's bsd tool
2007-04-27T14:46:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	i know it's not a great help but don't use apt-get. use aptitude instead. the dependencies are removed automaticaly
2007-04-27T14:51:00.000Z	dooglus	velko	I just tried "aptitude autoremove".  it told me "This aptitude does not have Super Cow Powers"
2007-04-27T14:52:00.000Z	velko	dooglus	:-) no autoremove. it's built in and makes no sense
