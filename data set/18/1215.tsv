2011-04-27T21:10:00.000Z	Teeko		anyone know how you make a program run in terminal if you use an .sh file to launch it?
2011-04-27T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	then it's nothing to do with the .sh file - it's the program
2011-04-27T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	what are you trying to run
2011-04-27T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	what are you trying to run ?
2011-04-27T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	what are you trying to run ?
2011-04-27T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	can you pastebin me the .sh file your trying to use ?
2011-04-27T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	ok, please pastebin it
2011-04-27T21:13:00.000Z	Teeko	ikonia	#!/bin/sh php -f mainloop.php config.php
2011-04-27T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	how do you launch it outside the script ?
2011-04-27T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	would you run a test for me ?
2011-04-27T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	open a terminal , and type the following "php -f mainloop.php config.php"
2011-04-27T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	if that's the working directory, yes please
2011-04-27T21:18:00.000Z	Teeko	ikonia	if i do it that way the program runs in terminal fine.
2011-04-27T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	ok, now do "cd /" - then do the same command again, but use absolute paths to the files
2011-04-27T21:19:00.000Z	Teeko	ikonia	think i may have it.
2011-04-27T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	that wasn't in the script you sent me
2011-04-27T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	probably because the bot never exits to move to the next command, you should launch the bot using & after the command so it backgrounds it and moves on to the next command
2011-04-27T21:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Teeko	 it won't close it as your running it from the termnial
