2011-07-16T11:58:00.000Z	nomad111		 my laptop fan is constantly running at max speed. I don't know how to address this issue. can anyone help?
2011-07-16T11:59:00.000Z	nomad111		it's spotless and only a month old
2011-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	nomad111		i got the laptop when the model was released last month and it is on ubuntu's supported hardware
2011-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	how do you know it's supported
2011-07-16T12:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	the symptons you are showing is common with hardware that doesn't have supported powerscaling or thermal sensors
2011-07-16T12:01:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	my laptop is the core i5 version
2011-07-16T12:02:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	just reading the link, seeing if there is anything of interest
2011-07-16T12:02:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	read point 2 of that page
2011-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	Standard images of Ubuntu may not work at all on the system....?
2011-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	yes, did your laptop come with a pre-installed version of ubuntu
2011-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	nope
2011-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	win7
2011-07-16T12:04:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	ok, so point 2 "standard images of ubuntu may not work well"
2011-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	sigh so the answer is to go back to windows 7? hehe
2011-07-16T12:06:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	I find that hardware page you've linked to just stupid to be honest, saying it's supported, but also may not work
2011-07-16T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	in what respect ?
2011-07-16T12:32:00.000Z	nomad111	ikonia	how it is setting fan levels
2011-07-16T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	nomad111	I'd look at the themal info, see if it "thinks" it's hot, or if it knows it's cold, but just "wants" to run the fan
