2006-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	soheil		Why cannot I compile my C++ codes in ubuntu?
2006-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	soheil		yes
2006-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	soheil		I g++ them
2006-09-28T10:09:00.000Z	soheil		no, just g++
2006-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	soheil		I installed g++-4.0
2006-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	soheil		Why cannot I compile my C++ codes in ubuntu?
2006-09-28T10:10:00.000Z	soheil		I installed g++-4.0
2006-09-28T10:11:00.000Z	soheil		I thought build-essential is neccessary to install debian paxkages
2006-09-28T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	wrong
2006-09-28T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	you need build-essential for most compiles
2006-09-28T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	because gcc or g++ alone don't contain everything that's needed. doesn't come with libc6-dev, for instance
2006-09-28T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	no, i meant "most compiles" as in "most stuff that you will compile". but anyway
2006-09-28T10:14:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	i don't know, don't use anjuta. but trust me anyway, you *want* to install build-essential if you want to do any compiling at all.
2006-09-28T10:14:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	just try installing it, and see if anjuta then works. i suppose anjuta might need make, which doesn't come with g++ either, only with build-essential
2006-09-28T11:01:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	i call < an input redirect, > an output redirect and | a pipe
2006-09-28T11:03:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	redirect symbols are "<", "<<", ">", ">>" and "|". unless you mean something else, but then please explain.
2006-09-28T11:03:00.000Z	LjL	soheil	read it?
