2006-11-29T10:42:00.000Z	romeo_		might the printer support be better in Edgy? ir so, I'll upgrade.
2006-11-29T10:42:00.000Z	w30	romeo_	pick local printer and pick use a dected printer?
2006-11-29T10:43:00.000Z	romeo_	w30	that's the funny thing,,,, when I choose the "local" dot, all I get is LPT1 and so forth, no USB listed.
2006-11-29T10:46:00.000Z	w30	romeo_	My setup doesn't even identify the device, it just calls it Deskjet-3520
2006-11-29T10:47:00.000Z	romeo_	w30	it shows up under cups! but not local.
2006-11-29T10:49:00.000Z	w30	romeo_	my device manager calls it /dev/usblp0 if that helps you?
2006-11-29T10:50:00.000Z	romeo_	w30	thank you I'll try that.
2006-11-29T10:51:00.000Z	w30	romeo_	I couldn't get cups printing working without going to some hair pulling out hairs on the cups.conf file

2006-11-29T10:52:00.000Z	w30	romeo_	and my Samsung networked printer still never finishes a job (it actually does) and I have to cancel the print job so I am not done there yet.
