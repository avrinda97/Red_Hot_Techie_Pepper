2009-09-13T00:49:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	your problem is that you have uninstalled kubuntu and now xp wont boot?
2009-09-13T00:50:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	do you have more then one hd?
2009-09-13T00:54:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	try this 6th comment > http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1141780.html
2009-09-13T00:56:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	did you change the hd priority while installing kubuntu?
2009-09-13T00:57:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	if you have more then one hd try changing the sequence in boot
2009-09-13T00:59:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	go to bios boot options put first boot device as 2nd hd - usually by highlighting the second hd and pressing + then saving and rebooting
2009-09-13T01:01:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	err forget it I thought you had two hds (internal) people usually setup grub on the hd with linux on it
2009-09-13T01:05:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	if your cd /dvd rom is not functional then I'm afraid there is not much you can do - solution from linux or windows both assume you can access cd/ dvd
2009-09-13T01:05:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	you just said you can't see the cd rom in boot menu?
2009-09-13T01:07:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	are you sure you are looking at the right place in bios?
2009-09-13T01:15:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	still there?
2009-09-13T01:16:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	in some computers pressing f-12 at boot time prompts if you want to boot from cd / dvd try that
2009-09-13T01:18:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	if that does not work and you cant boot from cd then you'll have to attach the hd (the one where vista was installed) to another win machine and do the recovery from there
2009-09-13T01:19:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	the button to bio is f-2 but we are talking about directly booting from cd
2009-09-13T01:34:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	floppy?
2009-09-13T01:37:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	if you are familiar with windows environment install xp/ vista on external hd through another pc
2009-09-13T01:42:00.000Z	Lights	Gogge	it depends if you can boot from an external hd - does it show up in boot devices in bios
