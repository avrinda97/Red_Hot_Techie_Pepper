2011-05-09T05:35:00.000Z	paul		is there any way to make a hard link that will change file names if the original file's name is also changed?
2011-05-09T05:36:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	not unless you want to make a hard link to a directory, and you don't want to do that.  (unless someone knows something I don't)
2011-05-09T05:37:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	thanks, it's weird because when I do ln man, it says that you can make a hard link of a directory, but it probalby won't work....
2011-05-09T05:37:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	yeah, you have to do some filesystem hacking for that to work, and you will probably destroy your system if you get it working.  Sadly I don't understand why.
2011-05-09T05:38:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	well thanks
2011-05-09T05:38:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	would having a cron job to copy changes do what you need it to?
2011-05-09T05:39:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	nah, i'm trying to make it so I can bittorent things and then make a hard link to where they should permanently be stored, and then after they are fully downloaded it will change the name from the hard link from "avi.part" to just "avi" after it finishes... it's turning out to be very difficult
2011-05-09T05:40:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	why not a softlink?
2011-05-09T05:41:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	because when I erase the file in the bittorent download directory (ie the original file) the soft link (in my TV sections of my server) won't work anymore, because the original file is gone.  Unless I'm missing something about soft links
2011-05-09T05:41:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	also, I'm not sure how well I'm describing my situation
2011-05-09T05:41:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	ah, I understand now.
2011-05-09T05:42:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	Jordan had a MUCH better idea than what I was typing :)
2011-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	your best bet might be to write a script to rename .part files.  sadly I do not know much scripting to help you.
2011-05-09T05:46:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	i ahve something SIMILAR going on, hard to explain
2011-05-09T05:47:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	I am guessing the idea of just downloading things into their final destinations is too easy?
2011-05-09T05:48:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	I can't specify to which directory each file will download when I use transmission for bittorents
2011-05-09T05:53:00.000Z	bluenail	paul	You've got me stumped, I think yor best bet is still to get a script to traverse your tree and do the renaming.
2011-05-09T05:54:00.000Z	paul	bluenail	yea, I have a script set up that... helps me a little, I'll be ok
