2009-11-06T19:18:00.000Z	flashsave		ffffffff: this assumes i want to download flash, i have the swf, but i need to get the flv file, any suggestions?
2009-11-06T19:20:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	when you say flv, are you referring to youtube vids?
2009-11-06T19:20:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	no
2009-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	I missed your issue; would you care to repeat it
2009-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	i have a swf file i downloaded from a private website and i need to download the flv to my hard disk; any ubuntu app to help me (gnash doesn't read it)?
2009-11-06T19:25:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	any suggestiosn?
2009-11-06T19:25:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	 to download or to play the swf or both
2009-11-06T19:25:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	to download only
2009-11-06T19:25:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	let me check
2009-11-06T19:31:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	not much out there in ubuntu to help huh?
2009-11-06T19:32:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	if you can watch it, you can get it from your cache
2009-11-06T19:32:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	i don't want propietary adobe flash to view it; there must be another option to get the flv
2009-11-06T19:35:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	you there still?
2009-11-06T19:35:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	yep
2009-11-06T19:35:00.000Z	flashsave	bazhang	if you don't know i can continue asking in here
2009-11-06T19:36:00.000Z	bazhang	flashsave	not much experience with gnash, only adobe flash; perhaps someone else knows the answer
