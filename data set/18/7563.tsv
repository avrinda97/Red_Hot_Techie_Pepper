2007-12-18T15:52:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN		!bluetooth errors
2007-12-18T15:53:00.000Z	spifff		hm i guess i'll have to investigate more closely again :( if i remember correctly the problem with feisty was that the bios would initialize BT and then emulate a PS/2 mouse... so the mouse as such would work but not the 3rd button or wheel. So this doesnt seem to be exactly the same problem now
2007-12-18T15:55:00.000Z	NeT_DeMoN	spifff	go here ##hardware
2007-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	spifff	NeT_DeMoN	ok... i guess i'll reboot first to reconfirm the exact behaviour
