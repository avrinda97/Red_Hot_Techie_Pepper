2004-12-22T17:28:00.000Z	daniels		guys, discussion of red hat off topic, yeah?
2004-12-22T17:30:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	discussion of how Ubuntu can benefit from other distro's withdrawal from certain market segments.
2004-12-22T17:37:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	now that you mention it, I'g getting tired of dvel changing its mind from hotplug->discover->udev wash/rince/repeat.
2004-12-22T17:38:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	'dvel'?
2004-12-22T17:40:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	er, we only had discover for the first month or so, while it was still internal; we used hotplug on the understanding that it was only a stopgap and that we'd do better for hoary, and we are, with udevd
2004-12-22T17:41:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	udev is a real mess.  I don't like it at all.  it breaks gpm.
2004-12-22T17:42:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	you dislike udev because gdm doesn't work with it, in some non-specific manner?
2004-12-22T17:43:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	if I use udev, X cannot find gpmdata
2004-12-22T17:43:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	if I remove udev, X suddenly can find gpmdata.
2004-12-22T17:48:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	so... I would hardly call that a non-specific abstract dislike.
2004-12-22T17:50:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	so you need one line to tell udev about gpmdata, or whatever.
2004-12-22T17:52:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	probably, yes.
2004-12-22T17:52:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	...
2004-12-22T14:26:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	that is so not a valid use case
2004-12-22T14:27:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	and what would be a valid case to justify moving it later, then?
2004-12-23T15:16:00.000Z	daniels	Q-FUNK	dude, take it to /msg.
2004-12-23T15:16:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	/msg blocked.
2005-04-17T07:09:00.000Z	Q-FUNK	daniels	exactly what does the artwork package have to do with it?
