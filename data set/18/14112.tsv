2007-03-26T15:50:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	With *nix, you don't really need to know where programs go.  They're all in your path.  So, (if you ddn't have an applicaion menu) you'd go to a terminal and type 'thunderbird' and it'd start.  (well, usually the name is pretty straightforward, sometimes you need to use tabcomplete to figure it out)
2007-03-26T15:51:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	like bigcx2 said.  Sometimes the name isn't quite so simple, but it's easy to figure out.  But even then, it should be in your application menu currently.
2007-03-27T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	Did you follow the instructions on that page?
2007-03-27T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
2007-03-27T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	5.04?  You should upgrade.
2007-03-27T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	twice, actually.
2007-03-27T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	You should upgrade to 6.06, since 5.10 will go out of support in a few weeks
2007-03-27T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	Yes, you upgrade in place.  That link has instructions.  You need to upgrade from 5.04 to 5.10, then from 5.10 to 6.06
2007-03-27T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	goku	You don't want to.  5.04 isn't supported anymore.  Download a newer version.
