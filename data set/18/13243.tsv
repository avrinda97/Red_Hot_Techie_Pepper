2012-03-12T19:44:00.000Z	elijah		Can someone who is running Ubuntu 11.10 and Server version: Apache/2.2.20 (Ubuntu) pastebin the output of the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf for me? I seem to have deleted the contents of mine and apache is failing to start with the contents of the Ubuntu one https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/apache2/2.2.20-1ubuntu1.2
2012-03-12T19:45:00.000Z	elijah		It is just a local development environment for Drupal and other sites
2012-03-12T19:45:00.000Z	elijah		I need to get virtual hosts working and I think I need some data in the httpd.conf file
2012-03-12T19:45:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	you should be able to reinstall the package
2012-03-12T19:46:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	k, I can try that. is it apt-get reinstall apache2
2012-03-12T19:46:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	ie: apt-get install --reinstall apache 3 (iirc)
2012-03-12T19:48:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	Thanks, I ran it and it went great, but the httpd.conf file was not updated so based on what Praxi said I think it ships empty
2012-03-12T19:49:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	it definately ships with content. Does the file exist - but it's empty? if so, remove it. Buit you should now have a httpd.conf.dist which you can copy in its place
2012-03-12T19:50:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	Yeah, it exists but is empty, i will remove it
2012-03-12T19:50:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	check there isn't a .dist version next to it now. If not, delete it and reinstall.
2012-03-12T19:51:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	There wasn't a dist version, I deleted it, reinstalled and it did not put the file back
2012-03-12T19:52:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	What does yours say, if you have one?
2012-03-12T19:52:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	let me see if I have an install - 11.04?
2012-03-12T19:53:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	11.10
2012-03-12T19:55:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	Nevermind, httpd.conf is deprecated, apache2.conf is where it is at now a ways - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5680993#post5680993
2012-03-12T19:56:00.000Z	johnm	elijah	ah, explains it :)
2012-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	and praxi - thanks for your help
2012-03-12T20:09:00.000Z	elijah	johnm	and praxi - It appears httpd.conf isn't actually deprecated but just for user configurations - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2567432/ubuntu-apache-httpd-conf-or-apache2-conf
