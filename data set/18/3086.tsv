2010-07-29T11:43:00.000Z	rxd		Its MinimalCD can this be installed using frugal
2010-07-29T11:44:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	It's a standalone install,... when you said frugal i thought you meant a minimal install,...
2010-07-29T11:45:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	what is frugal?
2010-07-29T11:45:00.000Z	rxd	collabra	frugal is when you install ubuntu on an ntfs partition without using the device say /dev/sda1 as your root
2010-07-29T11:47:00.000Z	rxd	collabra	like u have a readonly system...same like running from the CD but instead your initrd.gz filesystem.squashfs on the drive say c:\ubuntu
2010-07-29T11:47:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	oh,... well,... you can download ubuntu 10.04 LTS,... I think it has what's called an install using wubi.exe if you want to put it within windows.
2010-07-29T11:48:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	I'm not sure... maybe someone else could help you.

2010-07-29T11:56:00.000Z	rxd	collabra	Can MinimalCD be installed on the usb stick
2010-07-29T11:57:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	not sure,... just a sec.
2010-07-29T11:59:00.000Z	collabra	rxd	i found this... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick ..... I'm sure it'll work as long as you know what you're doing... I'm not sure what operating system you are using,... but i'm sure there's a way.
