2007-02-11T12:19:00.000Z	Gator		hey guys, I installed Ubuntu 6.10 but GRUB doesn't load on startup
2007-02-11T12:19:00.000Z	Gator		yeha >_>
2007-02-11T12:19:00.000Z	Gator		I'm guessing it's because I used a floppy to disable grub earlier
2007-02-11T12:20:00.000Z	Gator		My computer turns on, by it boots directly into XP
2007-02-11T12:20:00.000Z	cables	Gator	hold down the escape key when you boot, and see if the menu shows up. If it does, that means it's fixable.
2007-02-11T12:22:00.000Z	cables	Gator	I mean XP and Ubuntu... sorry
2007-02-11T12:22:00.000Z	cables	Gator	in that case, it's not what thekidrio thinks it is.
2007-02-11T12:25:00.000Z	cables	Gator	i think he was right... you don't need to hold Esc.
2007-02-11T12:25:00.000Z	cables	Gator	when it boots, choose the other HD from the boot list.
2007-02-11T12:29:00.000Z	cables	Gator	what were your other werid problems? I'm curious
2007-02-11T12:30:00.000Z	cables	Gator	fine, won't delay you, bye
2007-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	cables	Gator	remove that M then...
2007-02-12T08:53:00.000Z	cables	Gator	use "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" to get into a text editor.
2007-02-12T08:57:00.000Z	Gator	cables	It keeps showing up as a blank document when I type {{{sudo nano /ect/X11/xorg.conf}}}
2007-02-12T08:57:00.000Z	cables	Gator	replace "ect" with "etc" :)
2007-02-12T08:58:00.000Z	Gator	cables	Is there a command to immediately shutdown?
2007-02-12T08:59:00.000Z	cables	Gator	immediately?
2007-02-12T08:59:00.000Z	Gator	cables	yeah, instead of waiting 1 minute when I type {{{sudo shutdown 1}}}
