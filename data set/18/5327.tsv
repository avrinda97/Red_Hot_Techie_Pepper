2008-11-16T16:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	oh, sorry, files
2008-11-16T16:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	both linux?
2008-11-16T16:32:00.000Z	wos	Myrtti	yes
2008-11-16T16:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	secure network (lan) or Internet in between?
2008-11-16T16:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	nfs has been used for decades.
2008-11-16T16:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	it may not be as secure as sftp or samba or others, but it's fast
2008-11-16T16:36:00.000Z	wos	Myrtti	 whats sftp
2008-11-16T16:37:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	secured way, with encryption. Can be used over the Internet. Might be a hassle though
2008-11-16T16:38:00.000Z	wos	Myrtti	why would i do that when i have an encrypted wireless network?
2008-11-16T16:39:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	I've got nfs. sftp encrypts everything and transferring files is really slow (about 1/10 of the speed of nfs) with it
2008-11-16T16:40:00.000Z	wos	Myrtti	is nfs fine on an encrypted wireless network?
2008-11-16T16:40:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	I use it on my encrypted wireless, but it's your business to assess are you comfortable with it
2008-11-16T16:40:00.000Z	wos	Myrtti	why would it not be safe?
2008-11-16T16:41:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	it's as safe as your wireless encryption is
2008-11-16T16:42:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	I have no idea on how strong passwords etc you have set up in yours
2008-11-16T16:42:00.000Z	Myrtti	wos	please refer to the latest news on wpa encryption etc.
