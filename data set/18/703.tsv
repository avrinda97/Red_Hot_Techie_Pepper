2011-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	romm		hey guys. ubuntu 11.10 is very slow on my vm. i want to switch from unity to xfce. what's the easiest way to do that?
2011-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	romm		i was thinking apt-get install xubuntu-desktop as a starter...
2011-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	phiscibe	romm	is it a recent install
2011-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	romm	phiscibe	ya installed it yesterday.
2011-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	phiscibe		delete it get a xubuntu cd install fressh
2011-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	phiscibe		u cold install the xfc desktop in this one, b ut for me that always gives you grief down the road
2011-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	romm		hmm... well that's disappointing.
2011-10-17T14:55:00.000Z	romm		maybe i can change to some non-demanding version of gnome on this install?
2011-10-17T14:55:00.000Z	romm		anything but this awful unity.
2011-10-17T14:55:00.000Z	phiscibe		good luck, try the mixer settings form alsamixrt
2011-10-17T14:55:00.000Z	phiscibe		alsamixer
2011-10-17T14:57:00.000Z	phiscibe	romm	 it is no big problem to swithc in  polace it is just my preferenc eto to, you get too many controls on system settings that might  over lap login sessions get confuessed, but u can live with it
2011-10-17T14:57:00.000Z	phiscibe		sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and your off  to the races
2011-10-17T14:57:00.000Z	phiscibe		or the funny farm
2011-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	phiscibe		pick xfce at the log in screen for the session
2011-10-17T14:59:00.000Z	phiscibe		change the keyboard shortuts
2011-10-17T14:59:00.000Z	romm	phiscibe	i'm hoping i can uninstall unity after installing a different VM
2011-10-17T15:00:00.000Z	romm	phiscibe	in order to dodge all those overlaps.
