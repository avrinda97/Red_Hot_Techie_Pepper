2009-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	I suggest you call a local hotline if you need help on this
2009-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	wait, wrong person
2009-10-06T12:21:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	use sudo then
2009-10-06T12:22:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	sudo cp ~/Desktop/filename /media/[volume-name]/dest_file
2009-10-06T12:26:00.000Z	dandaman	snuxoll	i moved the folder to home/ubuntu now i get this "cp: omitting directory '/home/ubuntu/boot'
2009-10-06T12:26:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	cp doesn't recursively copy directories by default
2009-10-06T12:26:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	use cp -r
2009-10-06T12:27:00.000Z	dandaman	snuxoll	"CP: cannoty create directory 'media/disk-2/': no such file or directory"
2009-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	*/*media/disk-2
2009-10-06T12:29:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	leading slash is important
2009-10-06T12:29:00.000Z	snuxoll	dandaman	take out the *'s, they were used for emphasis....
