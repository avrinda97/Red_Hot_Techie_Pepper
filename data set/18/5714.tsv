2008-10-10T07:53:00.000Z	dhgwill		ack! i b0rked my system by upgrading to the intrepid version of libselinux1
2008-10-10T07:53:00.000Z	dhgwill		is there any way to use the livecd to reinstall the proper version?
2008-10-10T07:53:00.000Z	dhgwill		i upgraded a single package using dpkg -i (which i assumed would warn me about deps)
2008-10-10T07:54:00.000Z	dhgwill		;-)
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	dhgwill	the package needs to have those dependencies setup for that to happen.  They usually aren't for cross repo systems...
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	dhgwill	danbh_intrepid	i just downloaded libselinux1-vv.deb and ran sudo dpkg -i
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	dhgwill		it's not really a cross repo system
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	dhgwill		for a little background, and because i've got plenty of time if i have to reinstall
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	dhgwill	I think you can use the livecd, mount your root system, chroot into that mount point, and then install the correct package
2008-10-10T07:55:00.000Z	dhgwill		i was trying to upgrade vim to the intrepid version
2008-10-10T07:56:00.000Z	dhgwill	danbh_intrepid	Aha! thanks, that's a great point.
2008-10-10T07:57:00.000Z	dhgwill		on a different note, 8.04.1 livecd is beautiful
2008-10-10T08:03:00.000Z	dhgwill	danbh_intrepid	thanks, I think that worked swimmingly, although i got a weird error about not being able to create /dev/null (!!)  i'll be back after reboot to let you know if it worked and thank you profusely
2008-10-10T08:04:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	dhgwill	your welcome!
2008-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	dhgwill	danbh_intrepid	thanks a whole ton everything is back to normal. i can't believe i didn't think of chroot... it's actually a utility i've very rarely used
2008-10-10T08:16:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	dhgwill	the directions are actually classic for fixing a broken alpha testing system.  If one upgrade breaks it, you use that strat to update till a fix comes through
2008-10-10T08:17:00.000Z	dhgwill	danbh_intrepid	i'm only asking because you seem like you might know: is there an IRC channel for awesomeWM or tiling WMs in general?
2008-10-10T08:17:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	dhgwill	heh, I only know a few random things, and thats not one of them  : )   sorry
