2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	Maciel		OK: I have absolutely no idea how to install this thing
2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	Maciel		gparted
2008-07-01T07:59:00.000Z	Maciel		I have never installed anything GNU in my life, so the language the install file uses is like greek to me...
2008-07-01T08:01:00.000Z	Maciel		no, i got it from the web just now, it's just that I'm not sure what "cd to the directory and type "./configure"" means
2008-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	Maciel		erm... no...?
2008-07-01T08:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	what is it you are trying to install?
2008-07-01T08:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	no need to compile Gparted. start up Synaptic package manager or use sudo apt-get install gparted from a terminal
2008-07-01T08:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	good rule to follow is check Synaptic before downloading and compiling
2008-07-01T08:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	don't be sorry. we all started somewhere
2008-07-01T08:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	it should be in Applications> Accessories
2008-07-01T08:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	you are certain it installed
2008-07-01T08:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	System > Admin > Partition editor
2008-07-01T08:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	would make more sense for them to have it appear in the menu as Gparted
2008-07-01T08:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	well that might make a difference. I dont remember that far back
2008-07-01T08:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	why not upgrade?
2008-07-01T08:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	and 4 releases ago
2008-07-01T08:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	when you typed sudo apt-get install gparted what did you get?
2008-07-01T08:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	Maciel	I am going to prv msg you ok?
