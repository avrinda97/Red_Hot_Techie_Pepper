2006-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	Xaphoo		does anyone have any idea about my CD-rom problem?  I can't read CDs for some reason, though I can write them and I can read and write DVDs just fine.  CDs don't seem to be able to mount
2006-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	how are you mounting them? And is it a music CD or data CD?
2006-12-11T08:33:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	both don't work... mount /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0 says "no medium found"
2006-12-11T08:34:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	If it's a music CD, you can't mount it
2006-12-11T08:35:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	it's a data cd
2006-12-11T08:36:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	do you get an error from mount?
2006-12-11T08:37:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	try 'sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdb /media/cdrom0'
2006-12-11T08:40:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	but "file /dev/hdb" says /dev/hdb: block special (3/64)"
2006-12-11T08:40:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	looks like your CD-ROM drive can't read the CD
2006-12-11T08:40:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	why might that be?  ALL my CDs are like this... and all my DVDs are fine
2006-12-11T08:41:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	and the drive works fine when I'm in Windows, and burns ISOs just fine
2006-12-11T08:41:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	or at least it used to be able to burn ISOs, I haven't tried it recently
2006-12-11T08:43:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	what does 'cdrecord -checkdrive' say?
2006-12-11T08:45:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	http://pastebin.ca/274944
2006-12-11T08:47:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	what does 'ls -l /dev/cdrw' point to?
2006-12-11T08:47:00.000Z	chris_	Xaphoo	try 'sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrw /media/cdrom0'
2006-12-11T08:48:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	ls -l /dev/cdrw gives lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2006-12-10 16:50 /dev/cdrw -> hdb
2006-12-11T08:49:00.000Z	Xaphoo	chris_	" sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrw /media/cdrom0" gives "mount: no medium found"
