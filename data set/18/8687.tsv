2007-07-17T14:15:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		What is the 'g-conf editor'?
2007-07-17T14:15:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Err, gconf-editor
2007-07-17T14:16:00.000Z	bruenig|laptop	ThanatosDrive	it is an awful registry like settings configuration thing
2007-08-01T12:19:00.000Z	bruenig|laptop	ThanatosDrive	you can use utorrent
2007-08-01T12:19:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	I assume you mean on WINE? Yeah but it's...funky.
2007-08-01T12:20:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Really? I'll give it another shot then.
2007-08-01T12:20:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	I know nothing about compiling :(
2007-08-01T12:22:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Guess I'll be sticking with utorrent :(
2007-08-01T12:24:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Mind teaching me? Or pointing me to a clear guide?
2007-08-01T12:25:00.000Z	bruenig|laptop	ThanatosDrive	it is dependent on the program, but basically the source is distributed with a script called configure, you run that script, it will create a Makefile, you run the Makefile by typing "make", after that, you install it with "make install"
2007-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	I checked out the Deluge screenshots...doesn't look powerful enough for me. And I'm a picky user, so uTorrent it is I guess. Thanks though!
2007-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	bruenig|laptop	ThanatosDrive	what do you want
2007-08-01T12:33:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Basically...utorrent, hahaha
2007-08-01T12:45:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	I got the .deb of Deluge
2007-08-01T12:46:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Wait. You mean, I should google this stuff and figure it out myself.
2007-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	So I should get the..binary?
2007-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	Oops. Source*
2007-08-01T12:55:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	bruenig|laptop	So I got the tarball. tar.gz. What now?
