2008-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	Sonja		how do i mass-rename all files in a folder such, that I add a _ after the filename, e.g. picture.jpg to picture_.jpg
2008-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	try using the block renaming applet from thunar, search for rename in add/remove
2008-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	check in menu > applicatiosn > add/remove , search for rename
2008-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	it wont, replace nautilus,  but it is also a file manager yes
2008-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	no,  thunar has nice feature sbut nautilus is richer in my opinion,  I just like the rename tool , you can have boot with no issue
2008-03-24T03:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	put a card it in and then plug it
2008-03-24T03:03:00.000Z	Sonja	Pelo	that's what i did
2008-03-24T03:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	check in the my compute  filer fromt eh places menu,   see if you see it unmounted, right click mount if it is there
2008-03-24T03:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	it is powered on ?
2008-03-24T03:04:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	you say it usualy works ? then I don't know what could be the problem , sorry
2008-05-31T02:51:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	I was more thnking about installing mscorefonts
2008-05-31T02:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	this is in firefox ?
2008-05-31T02:52:00.000Z	Sonja	Pelo	instead of the proper mscorefonts arial, i see some weird font that looks like insects with letters inside them
2008-05-31T02:52:00.000Z	Sonja	Pelo	firefox, openoffice.org, everything
2008-05-31T02:53:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	that might be the the code page thingy I don'T remember what it is called , set to latin or iso or utf and such
2008-05-31T02:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	no clue sorry, you got my best shot, maybe doing a hdd search for   arial, deleting everything you see an then reinstlling  msttcorefont
2008-05-31T02:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	try locate arial
2008-05-31T02:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Sonja	yes
