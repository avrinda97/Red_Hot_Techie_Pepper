2006-04-11T08:26:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	yes you can build compile the kernel image on another ubuntu cp and then tranfer the image and install it with dpkg -i
2006-04-11T08:28:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	you should not have any problem with /lib/modules which will be for the local machine
2006-04-11T08:28:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	will i not have a problem on the /lib/modules path on my laptop since i believe it will not be consistent with the installed kernel from the remote pc.
2006-04-11T08:28:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	hmnn.. intresting.
2006-04-11T08:29:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	would you know a method of creating sort of like lib_modules debs so i can dpkg -i it also to make it consistent with the kernel? (if such method exist).
2006-04-11T08:31:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	i hope you won't find my question annoying.
2006-04-11T08:36:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	all ok , the question about the /lib/modules for the kernel i can be certain, to check pop into #debian or put a post on ubuntu mailing list. but i think that if you biuld a kernel image on a different ubuntu box and tranfer it. you should not have any problem
2006-04-11T08:37:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	thanks very much.
2006-04-11T09:00:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	i just rememberd when you install a kernel image the /lib/modules for that kernel is part of the kernel install process,
2006-04-11T09:00:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	then, all is well. that is a very cool info green_earz.
2006-04-11T09:01:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	so there's no really reason to worry. thanks man, you save me alot of headache trying to wait for a kernel to compile on this slow ECS G320 notebook.
2006-04-11T09:02:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	its like how a kernel install set grub up for you
2006-04-11T09:02:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	:)
2006-04-11T09:05:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	when you compile the kernel use the option -- initrd   to make life easyer
2006-04-11T09:16:00.000Z	green_earz	intuos_pen	when you build the kernel on the other machine do you use the /boot/config for the box you want the compile the kernel for and if so use the make oldconfig option
2006-04-11T09:16:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	okay, i'll do that.
2006-04-11T09:17:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	somehow, i am very particular in tweaking the kernel. even if it's time consuming i traverse the "subdirectories" of menuconfig diligently.
2006-04-11T09:18:00.000Z	intuos_pen	green_earz	trying to find that option that i do not need. (but it also managed to screw me several times).
