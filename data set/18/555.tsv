2011-12-28T11:48:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	I have had great success with streamripper... you can streamripper *source* but not sure about simultanous playback for multiple items.
2011-12-28T11:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	streamripper is a command-line tool. It is installed on my computer. Please tell me what it means to "source" streamripper.
2011-12-28T11:57:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	what are you ripping...
2011-12-28T12:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	I am ripping the stream http://dradio.ic.llnwd.net/stream/dradio_dkultur_m_a.ogg
2011-12-28T12:05:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	then just - streamripper http://dradio.ic.llnwd.net/stream/dradio_dkultur_m_a.ogg -  from terminal, but thats an ogg, you could just wget it
2011-12-28T12:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	I will give it a try but later. My problem is that VLC yesterday produced a sound at the same time when ripping but no longer today. So I should not give up VLC so easily in favor of another program.
2011-12-29T19:34:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	 ifconfig  ... or to be specific... sudo ifconfig | grep eth
2011-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	Your answer is false.
2011-12-29T19:41:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	what information are you looking for specifcally then? hardware information? ip address information? what?
2011-12-29T19:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	Preferably the hostnames of the devices. substed the IP addresses of the devices in my LAN (section).
2012-01-27T15:57:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	you shouldn't have to. i would actually suggest changing ntops configuration specifically (man ntop find the config, probably /etc/ntop.conf or such). http://krudas.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/ntop-on-ubuntu/
2012-01-31T10:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	What does the verb "to narf" mean?
2012-01-31T11:30:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	it has to do with the synaptics driver, as in touchpads etc.
2012-01-31T11:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	I know that. I'd like to know it more precisely.
2012-01-31T11:32:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	is Option "SHMConfig" "on" present in the xorg.conf? oic
2012-01-31T11:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	xorg.conf does not exist in my Ubuntu 11.10 GNOME Shell 3.2.1.
2012-01-31T11:37:00.000Z	metaspike	bullgard4	the closest thing i found was http://askubuntu.com/questions/50201/how-to-enable-shmconfig . you can create a standard conf with- Xorg -configure - as for the details i dunno. does - man synclient - have anything to say?
2012-01-31T11:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	metaspike	I read 'man synclient' before I posted here. It has no explanation. I know that I can create a file xorg.conf but I do not intend to because normally in Ubuntu 11.10 xorg.conf is no longer needed. My problem is that apparently sometimes a bug occurres and I'd like to hunt it.
