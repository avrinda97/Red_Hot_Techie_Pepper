2011-01-26T00:18:00.000Z	nabukadnezar43		i had a question regarding security
2011-01-26T00:18:00.000Z	nabukadnezar43		when i visited a site on windows, nod32 warned of a virus in a .jar form
2011-01-26T00:18:00.000Z	nabukadnezar43		is it possible to be affected by that virus on linux?
2011-01-26T00:19:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	if it is a multiplatform virus, yes
2011-01-26T00:20:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	some time ago a java virus infected some linux, windows and mac systems (but on linux and mac it was not persistent: after a reboot, the computer was clean again)
2011-01-26T00:21:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	do not run applets or java programs (actually, any programs) that you do not trust
2011-01-26T00:25:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	well, the program was runned by someone, sometime
2011-01-26T00:30:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	which virus was reported by nod32?
2011-01-26T00:30:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	do you remember the name?
2011-01-26T00:31:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	but the antivirus has a codename for each virus detected, I want to know this
2011-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	if you have caution, you don't
2011-01-26T00:36:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	but if you want a av, yes, I recommend clamav
2011-01-26T00:38:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	yep, but do not run untrusted programs (or java applets) and keep your system up to date
2011-01-26T00:38:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	i mean this by caution
2011-01-26T00:40:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	so, you have no virus on ubuntu
2011-01-26T00:40:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	so? I've missed the point
2011-01-26T00:41:00.000Z	marcobiscaro2112	nabukadnezar43	if you don't run any applet or any program, nothing
