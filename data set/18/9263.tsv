2007-04-24T15:10:00.000Z	Parmenion		lol, always the worst eh
2007-04-24T15:12:00.000Z	Parmenion		i would manually install ndiswrapper to workaround first
2007-04-24T15:13:00.000Z	Parmenion		i prefer wireless for my laptop... all the rest of the connections are wireless
2007-04-24T15:13:00.000Z	Parmenion		[swb] : true, but it doesnt matter so much now does it? its easier and more to configure
2007-04-24T15:14:00.000Z	Parmenion		lol crabgrass, i personally havent configured wireless as i just installed feisty, but i use mac filtering :P
2007-04-24T15:14:00.000Z	Parmenion		so not so much of free wireless for you :P
2007-04-24T15:15:00.000Z	crabgrass	Parmenion	you'd be amazed at how few people even use WEP keys
2007-04-24T15:15:00.000Z	crabgrass	Parmenion	and i'm using mac filtering in my wired router, even though i doubt it's necessassry
2007-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	ive got 5 broadband wireless networks with decent signal right open for the picking even from my home
2007-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	crabgrass	Parmenion	scary
2007-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	yep ....
2007-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	crabgrass	Parmenion	and to think... if they don't change the router's password, you can feed it a corrupt firmware update and brick it.
2007-04-24T15:18:00.000Z	crabgrass	Parmenion	such foolishness out there
2007-04-24T15:18:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	 i never thought of such an interesting attack vector XD
2007-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	a little too sick to be true.
2007-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	why not ? a single connection, but just daisy chaining it down right ?
2007-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	i dont think its possible simultaneously
2007-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	Parmenion	crabgrass	how to I find out what router people are using when they vary from the default essid
