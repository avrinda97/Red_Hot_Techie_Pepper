2007-12-07T18:15:00.000Z	gvsa123		help please... i can't get to the GUI of firestarter... i have sudo firestarter --start-hidden in start up, but no icon appears in the system tray... nor can i get to the GUI via system>admin>firestarter... i can see that it's running though through sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter status
2007-12-07T18:15:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	what happens when you try to start its gui?
2007-12-07T18:15:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	nothing... \
2007-12-07T18:17:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	it's still running though... i've also tried replacing the start up command with gksu, with -s and --start, with /usr/sbin/firestarter start, but still no GUI
2007-12-07T18:17:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	open an xterm and try to start it from there
2007-12-07T18:18:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	you need to be root probably
2007-12-07T18:18:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	how do i do xterm?
2007-12-07T18:19:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	open a terminal
2007-12-07T18:19:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	i know... but i also have myself added in sudo visudo to have nopasswd as suggested in their website
2007-12-07T18:20:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	with sudo firestarter i get: refused by server, xlib no protocol specified, cannot open display
2007-12-07T18:21:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	i also get that even if i stop the daemon
2007-12-07T18:23:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	must be something with my gutsy install since i never had problems with edgy and feisty and i have all the same configs following the steps in their website
2007-12-07T18:29:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	you need gksudo, not sudo
2007-12-07T18:30:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	i think i found a solution... tried that already... i'll restart and report back just to see if it works...
2007-12-07T18:37:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	this is crazy.... now i get three instances of the gui!... but only with my login... the other users are okay... they have the icon on startup minimized to the tray
2007-12-07T18:41:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	i got the solution from the forums... i added  Defaults !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn,env_reset,env_keep+="DISPLAY HOME XAUTHORIZATION" to sudoers
2007-12-21T06:44:00.000Z	wols	gvsa123	morally or technically?
2007-12-21T06:44:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols	lol... technically.
