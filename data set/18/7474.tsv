2009-12-16T02:30:00.000Z	exarkun		When I try to "activate" the NVIDIA proprietary driver, all I get is a dialog titled "Cannot change driver" that says "Reconfiguring X.org video drivers is not possible: /etc/X11/xorg.conf is invalid."
2009-12-16T02:30:00.000Z	exarkun		If xorg.conf is invalid, it's not my fault, I never touched it.
2009-12-16T02:31:00.000Z	exarkun		How do I get it to be valid?
2009-12-16T02:32:00.000Z	apocalypt	exarkun	in terminal try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-12-16T02:32:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	Then what?
2009-12-16T02:34:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	/etc/X11/xorg.conf is unchanged after running that
2009-12-16T02:36:00.000Z	apocalypt	exarkun	try to get an older version of xorg. there are backups under /etc/X11/
2009-12-16T02:41:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	It claims they're all invalid.
2009-12-16T02:42:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	I'm in X now, by the way.  I'm not sure if that was obvious already.
2009-12-16T02:43:00.000Z	apocalypt	exarkun	i can't believe. did u restart the Xserver after moving xorg.backup to xorg?
2009-12-16T02:43:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	yes
2009-12-16T02:44:00.000Z	apocalypt	exarkun	if u are in X all times it is not possible that u has X restarted
2009-12-16T02:44:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	All times?  Not all times, but I'm in X now, and I was in X before.
2009-12-16T02:44:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	I ran 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart' in between
2009-12-16T02:46:00.000Z	apocalypt	exarkun	ok thats right. There should be the original Xorg in /etc/X11/ it must be the oldest file. the xorg u got through the installation of Ubuntu
2009-12-16T02:48:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	Okay, I'll try it.  But I tried a few already, including the .failsafe, all with the same results.
2009-12-16T02:51:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	Same result
2009-12-16T02:51:00.000Z	exarkun	apocalypt	I guess you think I should read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution ?
