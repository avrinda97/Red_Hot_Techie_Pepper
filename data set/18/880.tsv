2011-08-16T12:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	the swap isn't important for installs, delete all and make a new one with the new partitioning for the install.

2011-08-16T12:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	just remove the one closest to the unallocated, you only need one, also how much ram do you have?
2011-08-16T12:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	there is no correct
2011-08-16T12:59:00.000Z	kaellan	urlin2u	i got 6 gig 1333 mhz on this laptop
2011-08-16T13:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	cool your swap is fine then I suggest the one to remove as it will give you more unallocated .
2011-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	kaellan	urlin2u	hmm i dont find how to make the partition im on bigger/increased over the amount of free space
2011-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	I don't understan that.
2011-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	kaellan	urlin2u	how to make a partiion bigger?
2011-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	sorry you have to do it from a live cdturn off the swap when you do.
2011-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	kaellan	urlin2u	ok
2011-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	kaellan	cool turn off the sap to do it.
