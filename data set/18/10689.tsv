2007-04-08T09:39:00.000Z	z1pp3r		So, i've managed to throw away my username and password for a router that is 300km away from me... Anyone know of a website or another way to check which port are forwarded to my server?
2007-04-08T09:40:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	Why do you need to use a router 300km away? And most routers do not use remote admin by default.
2007-04-08T09:40:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	You need to be physicaly at your router and press reset.
2007-04-08T09:40:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	have a server behind that router, and i need a port forwarded so i can setup psybnc on it
2007-04-08T09:41:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	that would probably be ideal yeah, but i know i've already got some forwarded to it, which i do not use
2007-04-08T09:41:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	Is remoteadmin enabled?
2007-04-08T09:41:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	on the router, no. But ssh is forwarded to the server, so np
2007-04-08T09:42:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	If  you forgot the password, also nothing you can do.
2007-04-08T09:42:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	Most routers use port 80 for administartion. Try http:\\192.168.1.1
2007-04-08T09:42:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	only forgot the pass to the router, so you're right, cant make any new nat entries. However, i should be able to use some of the ones i've already setup.
2007-04-08T09:42:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	i have no problems finding the admin interface, i've just forgotten the user/pass for it
2007-04-08T09:43:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	Did you change it from default?
2007-04-08T09:43:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	If yes, then the router will NOT let you reset it unless you have PHYSICAL access to it.
2007-04-08T09:43:00.000Z	Firefoxman	z1pp3r	Ask someone to go to it and reset it for you if possible.
2007-04-08T09:44:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Firefoxman	doesnt matter, i do not need to configure the router. I just need to know which ports are already forwarded.
