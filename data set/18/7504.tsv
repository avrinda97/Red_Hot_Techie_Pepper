2007-12-28T14:42:00.000Z	LetterRip		is there a known problem with processor on dual core processors?  Watching my processor usage the processors are being 'used' about the exact same - even though I have a task that should only be utilizing one processor with any sort of load
2007-12-28T14:42:00.000Z	LetterRip		ie playback of a video
2007-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	that's probably the linux scheduler shuffeling stuf around
2007-12-28T14:44:00.000Z	LetterRip	Wander_w	hrrmmm that doesn't make sense
2007-12-28T14:44:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	you can probably stop it from doing that by doing: echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/sched_mc_power_savings
2007-12-28T14:44:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	Why not?
2007-12-28T14:45:00.000Z	LetterRip	Wander_w	i get 'permission denied'
2007-12-28T14:48:00.000Z	LetterRip	Wander_w	my processor is an AMD 64 x2 if that affects anything
2007-12-28T14:49:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	Why do you want to prevent linux from scheduling jobs on multiple cores anyway?
2007-12-28T14:50:00.000Z	LetterRip	Wander_w	I'd just like to kill the ridiculous amount of noise my fan is making under linux
2007-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	uhm... then you are probably after the wrong problem
2007-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	you should check if ondemand cpu governor is used
2007-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	LetterRip	Wander_w	actually what I've read of the command you just pasted stated that that reduces power usage - ergo fan usage
2007-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	yeah, but just a bit
2007-12-28T14:52:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	what does cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor say?
2007-12-28T14:53:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	thats good
2007-12-28T14:53:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	are you on a laptop or on a desktop?
2007-12-28T14:54:00.000Z	Wander_w	LetterRip	uhmm... try www.linuxpowertop.org and do the tips it suggests
