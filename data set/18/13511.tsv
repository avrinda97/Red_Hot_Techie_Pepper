2005-11-17T13:49:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	yeah, you can thank Sun Microsystems for that

2005-11-17T14:01:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	don't be rude
2005-11-17T14:02:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	you are being...I had ubotu give you a wiki page to read

2005-11-17T14:04:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	be more specific about what didn't work
2005-11-17T14:04:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	I strongly advise using make-jpkg (in the java-package package), after downloading Sun's .bin installer
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	Dreadnought	tritium	how do i do that
2005-11-17T14:05:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	quit your tone.  I'm tired of seeing you say "duh".
2005-11-17T14:06:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	the wiki page explains that
2005-11-17T14:09:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats tells you all you need to know.  (read section 4. Getting Java)
2005-11-17T14:11:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	please stop using that tone.  words like "duh" and "jeez" don't give the impression you appreciate the help
2005-11-17T14:18:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	you already built your java .deb using make-jpkg?
2005-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	tritium	Dreadnought	how many times have I asked you to watch your tone?
