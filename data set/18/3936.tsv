2009-09-07T07:15:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		I can't find any good video editors for Ubuntu; Kino doesn't work because i don't have firewire on here, all I have is a capture card
2009-09-07T07:17:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		I used to make more than enough movies when I used windows, but when I installed ubuntu
2009-09-07T07:18:00.000Z	GuidMorrow		*crickets chirping*
2009-09-07T07:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	what kind of video editing? cutting and pasting clips and such?
2009-09-07T07:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	check out if avidemux suits you.
2009-09-07T07:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	avidemux has many options for "advanced" editing, but isn't good for cutting and pasting many clips.
2009-09-07T07:22:00.000Z	GuidMorrow	prince_jammys	is that supported under ubuntu
2009-09-07T07:23:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	no, but installable.
2009-09-07T07:30:00.000Z	GuidMorrow	prince_jammys	what utility can I find that records video from my capture card?
2009-09-07T07:30:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	i don't know. vlc comes to mind, but i don't really know.
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	GuidMorrow	prince_jammys	what the crap, cinelerra crashed, and now Computer Janitor wants to clean it away from my system
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	hehe. i installed it too!
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	i don't know who this janitor is. i don't have one.
2009-09-07T08:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	fire him.
2009-09-07T08:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	my opinion of it wasn't too stellar, either, after very brief exposure.
2009-09-07T08:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	perhaps it has its own irc channel. it's not supported here.
2009-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	ha. you playin' berzerk?
2009-09-07T09:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	GuidMorrow	if you didn't get that, never mind. i must be old.
