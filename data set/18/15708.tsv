2005-02-21T15:00:00.000Z	mjt		what's wrong with using libgcc1 and gcc-base from 4.0 ?
2005-02-21T15:02:00.000Z	mjt		nod
2005-02-21T15:03:00.000Z	mjt		hmm.. a maildir better than maildir?
2005-02-21T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	well, i want speed, but also need to access it from other PCs from time to time...
2005-02-21T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	courier and cyrus both seem slow when moving large amounts of messages about
2005-02-21T15:04:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	i mean an order of magniture or 2 slower than maildir, seems like a lot of overhead
2005-02-21T15:05:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	maildir several hundred messages... few seconds... imap few seconds for 3%
2005-02-21T15:06:00.000Z	mjt	Dreamer31	after all, with standard maildir (courier, dovecot) you can just mv files around
2005-02-21T15:06:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	well, not exactly... courier (at least) creates lots of hints files that evolution likes to show, which doesn't make it seamless for normal use
2005-02-21T15:07:00.000Z	mjt	Dreamer31	hmm which hints?  You mean flags?
2005-02-21T15:07:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	courierimapkeywords, etc
2005-02-21T15:07:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	dovecot works with /Maildir in your home?
2005-02-21T15:08:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	i did :)
2005-02-21T15:09:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	wow, dovecot is way faster than cyrus
2005-02-21T15:10:00.000Z	mjt	Dreamer31	check out maildir_copy_with_hardlinks setting in /etc/dovecot.conf too
2005-02-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	i think that would only work copying folders around inside the imap server :)
2005-02-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	neat though
2005-02-21T15:12:00.000Z	Dreamer31	mjt	and i don't really copy, i move :)
