2008-02-06T03:54:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	you positive it got that feature? been trying tons of diffrent editors, most of them wants you to write the line before you can 'autocomplete' it, which takes away the whole point
2008-02-06T03:54:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	Lemme check.
2008-02-06T03:54:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	cheers :)
2008-02-06T03:55:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	It's very small. Would take about a minute to download yourself.
2008-02-06T03:56:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	yea i guess you are right, ill give it a shot :) brb
2008-02-06T03:56:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	I can't see any option for autocomplete.
2008-02-06T03:56:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	Nor does it appear to be on by default.
2008-02-06T03:59:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	it actually had that feature - for html only tho, im almost there :)
2008-02-06T04:01:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	What do you mean by autocomplete. Several seem to insert the closing tag (which annoys the crap out of me).
2008-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	well basicly, if i would start typing something, for example 'ba', dreamweaver would give me a few options starting on 'ba', like background...
2008-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	I've never looked for it in an editor. Nor have I ever used it.
2008-02-06T04:05:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	bah, i feel rather crippled without it, as im used to it.. guess it made me rather lazy :) .. well, thanks for the help mate, so far bluefish was the best actually
2008-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	If you search Synaptic for "html editor" you get tonnes. I would just install them and try them out.
2008-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	yea thats basicly what ive been doing so far.. tried a good 10 or so, starts to get pretty boring tho :)
2008-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	Hemebond	Kenn	Agreed. I've done it before. I end up just using gedit.
2008-02-06T04:07:00.000Z	Kenn	Hemebond	i guess i will end up doing the same in a few hours.. :)
