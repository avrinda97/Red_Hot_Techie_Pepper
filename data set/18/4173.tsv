2009-08-26T04:34:00.000Z	hlfshell		hello - i really need to allow a friend to SSH into my computer- how do i gedt this to work and let them SSH into me?
2009-08-26T04:35:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	apt-get install openssh-server
2009-08-26T04:35:00.000Z	hlfshell	DopeGhoti	- alright, I did that much. Then what?
2009-08-26T04:35:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	once the server is running, they can, from their system, use 'ssh username@0.0.0.0' (with your IP address)
2009-08-26T04:36:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	anytime :)
2009-08-26T04:37:00.000Z	hlfshell	DopeGhoti	- it asks for hostkeys but i dont know wht those are/etc. plus /etc/init.d/ssh but not sshd exists
2009-08-26T04:38:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	the first time you SSH in to a new system, you are asked if the host key is correct.  in most cases, teh answer is 'yes'
2009-08-26T04:39:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	/etc/init.d/ssh is the script used to start and stop the SSH server
2009-08-26T04:40:00.000Z	hlfshell	DopeGhoti	- but now neither of us are seeing much success connecting. Could I just be a fool and using the wrong IP?
2009-08-26T04:40:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	good, your SSH server is running.  To test it from your local machine, you can 'ssh username@127.0.0.1'
2009-08-26T04:40:00.000Z	hlfshell	DopeGhoti	- that worked :-)
2009-08-26T04:41:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	what IP is your friend using?  does it start with 192.168 ?
2009-08-26T04:42:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	it your friend on the same network as you, or on the other side of the itnernet?
2009-08-26T04:43:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	you need your actual IP address.  go to www.ipchicken.com; you'll see your actual IP there in large blue numbers
2009-08-26T04:43:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	you will also need to set up SSH forwarding on your router
2009-08-26T04:43:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	see http://www.portforward.com/
2009-08-26T04:45:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	yes- your are connecting through a router. when your friend tries to SSH in, the router doesn't know what to do with the SSH request if the forwarding isn't set up
2009-08-26T04:45:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	hlfshell	quite welcome
