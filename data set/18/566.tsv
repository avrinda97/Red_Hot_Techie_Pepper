2011-12-23T20:17:00.000Z	insectatorious	pitlimit	no worries, keep in mind that you can only change to desktop env that have been installed, so if you want the gnome-panel you will have to install it via the Software Center
2011-12-23T20:17:00.000Z	pitlimit		oh
2011-12-23T20:17:00.000Z	pitlimit		got it thank you

2011-12-23T20:22:00.000Z	pitlimit		so how do I install whatever I need to get it bazhang
2011-12-23T20:22:00.000Z	insectatorious	pitlimit	the entire Gnome dektop env has been upgraded in 11.10
