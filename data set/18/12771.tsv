2006-05-24T11:02:00.000Z	reggaemanu		debiajn is a good distro, but the community is pretty inactive, and really "mind limited" (they don't like other distro users, like ubuntu's ones for example..)
2006-05-24T11:03:00.000Z	reggaemanu		debian*
2006-05-24T11:05:00.000Z	reggaemanu		haha, automatix sucks
2006-05-24T11:06:00.000Z	reggaemanu		the author doesn't respect the GPL licence of easyubuntu (it is based on the easybuntu code)
2006-05-24T11:08:00.000Z	reggaemanu		hmm sorry it was for nickrud
2006-05-24T11:08:00.000Z	reggaemanu		easyubuntu exist for around 1 year now...
2006-05-24T11:08:00.000Z	reggaemanu		and there was a fight because of the non-respect of the licence for automatix
2006-05-24T11:09:00.000Z	reggaemanu		so easyubuntu is older than automatix
2006-05-24T11:09:00.000Z	reggaemanu		but automatix is more "complete" it's not for newbies
2006-05-24T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	it's not a french app
2006-05-24T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	it's not a fork, either
2006-05-24T11:15:00.000Z	reggaemanu	tritium	maybe not now, i don't really know, but in the beginning it was ;)
2006-05-24T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	nope, never was
2006-05-24T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	impossible, as it came first
2006-05-24T11:15:00.000Z	reggaemanu	tritium	no it wasn't come first ^^
2006-05-24T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	you are mistaken, sir
2006-05-24T11:18:00.000Z	reggaemanu	tritium	fort release of eaysubuntu was 08/21/05 and first automatix release was 09/17/05 (i've just checked) so, sorry but YOU are wrong :)
2006-05-24T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	reggaemanu	again, you are mistaken, but it is offtopic, and we won't debate it further
