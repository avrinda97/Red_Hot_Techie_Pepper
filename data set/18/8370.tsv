2007-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	I wasnt.
2007-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	TataraKutere_	Pici	could anybody help me?
2007-08-29T08:34:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	Just read what it says above.
2007-08-29T08:39:00.000Z	TataraKutere_	Pici	I'm sorry, but there's no trash icon in my desktop folder, even after checking "show hidden files"...:(
2007-08-29T08:40:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	In KDE or gnome?
2007-08-29T08:42:00.000Z	TataraKutere_	Pici	I think it's Gnome, but i really am not sure...:(
2007-08-29T08:42:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	You would need to open gconf-editor and navigate to /apps/nautilus/desktop and find a key to enable the trash
2007-08-29T08:43:00.000Z	TataraKutere_	Pici	it saze no such file or directory...:(
2007-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	I think you need to install the gconf-editor first
2007-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	sudo apt-get install gconf-editor
2007-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	Yes, synaptic could do it too.
2007-08-29T08:45:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	I might be.
2007-08-29T08:46:00.000Z	Pici	TataraKutere_	If I dont respond, I'm afk, and you should ask someone else instead of waiting around for me.
