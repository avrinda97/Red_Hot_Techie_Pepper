2011-11-04T20:39:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	not true -- PAE
2011-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	though with a 32-bit system he couldn't use all his RAM in a single process
2011-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	pae is bad and can only adress 1.2 gb per process
2011-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	*shrug* -- PAE is overhead, but it's not _that much_ overhead for most use cases.
2011-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	pae is really bad
2011-11-04T20:40:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	and yes, I specified earlier that if he was going to run individual processes that were going to use much RAM, 64-bit was the Right Thing
2011-11-04T20:41:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	i386 can adress up to 4gb per process, pae can handle 1.2gb per process
2011-11-04T20:41:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	...re: "really bad" -- not so much, no. My servers are hosted with linode; they suggest 32-bit for many use cases (things that aren't databases or memcached), and have compelling benchmarks that the overhead of PAE is actually below the noise threshold.
2011-11-04T20:42:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	yes, but how often do you _need_ more than 1.2gb/process when all you're doing is webdev?

2011-11-04T20:42:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	read that, then rethink about "pae is not so bad"
2011-11-04T20:42:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	...I can't say I care more about Linus's opinion than about benchmarks.
2011-11-04T20:42:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	...I mean, I'm never saying it _isn't_ an awful, ugly hack
2011-11-04T20:43:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	so there is no single reason to use pae
2011-11-04T20:43:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	but if it doesn't impact production performance, I have trouble caring how awful or ugly it is.
2011-11-04T20:43:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	sure there is -- memory usage in constrained environments. Which a 4gb system probably _isn't_, granted.
2011-11-04T20:44:00.000Z	iceroot	nDuff	you read the think about "more then 1gb should use amd64"?
2011-11-04T20:44:00.000Z	nDuff	iceroot	...it's probably a fair rule.
