2005-01-13T17:47:00.000Z	unperson		I don't really know what Ubuntu's goals are. Frankly, I don't care that much.  Right now it works well for me.  I think you're right if the goal is to take over most of Windows' market share, but I'm not sure that's the goal (or necessarily possible).
2005-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	unperson		I also think that there isn't a "point of Linux" per se, other than to be useful.  The great think about free software is that different groups can decide what "useful" means to them.
2005-01-13T13:21:00.000Z	unperson		So, if you have a directory DIR, DIR/FOLDER is a subdirectory.  What is the term for DIR/FOLDER/OTHERFOLDER?  In other words, what's the term for all directories that are under DIR?  Is it also subdirectory, or does that only refer to the first tier?
2005-01-13T13:21:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	"subdirectories"
2005-01-13T13:23:00.000Z	unperson	crimsun	Ok.  Just sort of realized I didn't know for sure.  :-)
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	so to speak
2005-02-16T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	a mix of sarge and sid (moreso the latter) with syncs and merges
2005-02-16T12:31:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	many ubuntu packages have a full life of their own after merging
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	unperson	crimsun	But outside of the ubuntu packages, universe is basically a frozen snapshot of sid, right?
2005-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	essentially, yes, at UVF.
2005-02-16T12:38:00.000Z	unperson	crimsun	Ah so universe = sid main, and multiverse = sid non-free?
2005-02-16T13:00:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	it's highly recommended that you dist-upgrade to hoary directly if you wish to use the latest packages.
2005-02-16T13:00:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	using backports often gets one into a bind because the packages are versioned poorly, so dist-upgrades cause headaches
2005-02-16T13:03:00.000Z	unperson	crimsun	Yeah, but generally I don't care about using the latest versions.  I'd rather few downloads and more stability.  There are only one or two apps I want the most current versions of, like firefox.
2005-02-16T13:04:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	all right, but do keep in mind the backports'-broken-versioning caveat if you plan to dist-upgrade to hoary.
2005-02-16T13:06:00.000Z	crimsun	unperson	essentially.
