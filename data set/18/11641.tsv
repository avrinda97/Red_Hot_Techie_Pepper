2006-11-09T10:23:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm		i updated ubuntu recently, but for some reason my swap didnt come with it. what do i do?
2006-11-09T10:23:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	how much ram do you have?
2006-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	I have 256MB RAM
2006-11-09T10:24:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	you could see if you have any unpartitioned space left and create it there, otherwise you could resize a partition
2006-11-09T10:27:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	I upgraded to the latest release of ubuntu  recently so there was already a swap partition,,, but i dont know what to do to get it back
2006-11-09T10:28:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	you can check with "free"
2006-11-09T10:30:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	swap is 0 but if  i look through the device manager...i get that i have 4 partitions: ext3, ntfs and two unlabeled ones (im dual booted with XP)
2006-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	don't know what happened there
2006-11-09T10:34:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	hmm...i dont know. Is there a way for me to gain access to the other partitions on my HDD through ubuntu? or do i need to run a live cd or something to tweak?
2006-11-09T10:34:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	ubuntu needs to mount swap partitions maybe the entry is missing from fstab ?
2006-11-09T10:38:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	how would i figure out whether the entry exists or not??
2006-11-09T10:39:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	you will need to check if one of those partitions is in fact a swap, i dont know how to to that. IF so, it just needs to be mounted in fstab.
2006-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	Thanks for the help! ill see if i can figure out how to determine which partition is what :d
2006-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	most likely swap, as what could have been there before?
2006-11-09T10:43:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	well, i have the ntfs winXP partition....an ext3 partition, and two others
2006-11-09T10:47:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	jStefan	this looks really promising... maybe ill just go with making a swap file and deal with the partition later....
2006-11-09T10:47:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	ok
2006-11-09T10:48:00.000Z	jStefan	radioaktivstorm	check the troubleshooting section too
