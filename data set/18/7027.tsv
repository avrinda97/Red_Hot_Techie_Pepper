2008-02-21T07:03:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	You probably need libdvdcss2
2008-02-21T07:10:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	It's most likely a software problem, try running "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh"
2008-02-21T07:11:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	That may have actually been the wrong path, I am using 8.04 currently
2008-02-21T07:16:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	What is the output of "dpkg -s libdvdcss2 | grep Status" ( should be only one line )
2008-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	I'm not sure how to get that.  Do I copy and paste that command in the termina?
2008-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	Yes
2008-02-21T07:17:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	install ok
2008-02-21T07:19:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	Have you ever set the region for your dvd drive? ( I am not sure if this should be needed with libdvdcss but it's something worth checking )
2008-02-21T07:19:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	No I haven't.  Not sure how.
2008-02-21T07:20:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	Do DVD's play properly in Windows?
2008-02-21T07:20:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	yes they did before I switched.  :-)
2008-02-21T07:21:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	Then the region has already been set
2008-02-21T07:21:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	I was using DVD Shrink and DVD Decrypter before with no problems
2008-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	That is different, could you use a ( legal ) DVD playing software?
2008-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	that was before in windows.  I'm now using VLM, Totem and gxine and none works
2008-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	how do I reinstall Ubuntu without deleting everything?
2008-02-21T07:25:00.000Z	jordan_	fredsua	You can put your /home on a separate partition:
2008-02-21T07:26:00.000Z	fredsua	jordan_	thank you
