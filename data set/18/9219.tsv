2007-06-12T16:09:00.000Z	kitche	neverblue	your devices might have changed actually
2007-06-12T16:09:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	might have changed?
2007-06-12T16:09:00.000Z	neverblue		not sure where your coming from
2007-06-12T16:10:00.000Z	kitche	neverblue	/dev/hda might become /dev/sda depending on the kerenl what version is the new kernel do you know by chance off the top of your head
2007-06-12T16:10:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	from the last update?
2007-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	is that what you were implying?
2007-06-12T16:15:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	the latest update my have moved my devices to different locations?
2007-06-12T16:15:00.000Z	kitche	neverblue	the newer kernels might be using libata but without me knowing the version of the kernel you installed I can't be sure
2007-06-12T16:16:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	are we both talking about the same thing?
2007-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	I have two machines, this one, and the other in my other office in an entirely different building, as well as one at home.  I updated all three, and its just this one (in my other office) that has crashed from this last update
2007-06-12T16:21:00.000Z	neverblue	kitche	so I am not sure if you were replying to another question or not
