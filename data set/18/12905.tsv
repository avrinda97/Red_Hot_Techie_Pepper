2006-05-16T15:07:00.000Z	adamm		would someone please tell me the command to mount my external firewire hardrive that is formated as HFS+
2006-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	adamm can you _see_ the hard drive as a device first of all?
2006-05-16T15:08:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	when i type in fdisk -l it says that disk sda doesnt contain a valid partition table
2006-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	ah, perhaps hfs is not installed in the kernel
2006-05-16T15:10:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	and you've tried mounting manualy with mount -t hfs ... ... ect?
2006-05-16T15:11:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	do you know the command for that offhand? I already have a folder created in media to mount it to
2006-05-16T15:12:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	mount -t hfs /dev/sdX /mnt/point
2006-05-16T15:13:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	it says "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock, missing codepage or other error...
2006-05-16T15:15:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	not good, I have a mac but I've never tried to mount it
2006-05-16T15:15:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	perhaps my filesystem is not correctly formatted? is there a way to tell through ubuntu? it works fine on a mac
2006-05-16T15:16:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	it could be that the version of hfs is not suported or you have an old version in the kernel. I don't know.
2006-05-16T15:18:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	have you checked the support for hfs+?
2006-05-16T15:20:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	once you have it mounting the way you like you can add it to your /etc/fstab for safe keeping
2006-05-16T15:21:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	umount /mount/point
2006-05-16T15:21:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	ahh thanks that was my next question
2006-05-16T15:27:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	have a look at some hfs+ mounting tools called hpmount and hpumount
2006-05-16T15:28:00.000Z	adamm	doctormo	will do
2006-05-16T15:28:00.000Z	doctormo	adamm	there is also some sites saying kernels 2.6.16 and later suport read/write
