2011-09-07T02:10:00.000Z	coraxx		What does one do, if one wants to contribute to Linux/Ubuntu with driver-development ...in this particular case USB scanner-drivers for SANE ?
2011-09-07T02:11:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	i'm just guessing but you might want to find the SANE website or see if they have a project on Launchpad
2011-09-07T02:16:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	I have found this in Launchpad --> https://launchpad.net/sane-backends
2011-09-07T02:18:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	...they talk of an API, which sounds VERY interesting.  I just wish there were more details outthere on the web about how to create USB drivers in Linux for hardware that is not supported but you own....so you might be able to get reverse-enginering data from.
2011-09-07T02:20:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	i might be able to help you understand the process to reverse engineer something like this.
2011-09-07T02:21:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	VERY COOL ... I am _ALL_ ears :-D
2011-09-07T02:21:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	first, you need a way to get the USB data. You mentioned a windows tool, you will need this. I am looking for a way to do this on linux now
2011-09-07T02:22:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	it appears that wireshark can capture USB data
2011-09-07T02:22:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	to tool I was reffered to was this one --> http://www.wingmanteam.com/usbsnoopy/
2011-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	so, depending on how much you can understand about the protocol that is used (wireshark should help with that) you can move between windows and linux coding as you go if you don't understand something or doing a lot at once
2011-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	yes, but If the data was already in Linux then there wouldn't be a problem ;-) .... to see the device work proberly it will have to go the MS Windows, right ?
2011-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	yes, but it always helps to have a cross-platform alternative
2011-09-07T02:24:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	*go the = go through
2011-09-07T02:25:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	does Wireshark run in MS Windows ?
2011-09-07T02:25:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	yeah, it works
2011-09-07T02:25:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	AAAAAHHHH...very cool ...I didn't now that ... then of course that would be the better choice
2011-09-07T02:25:00.000Z	coraxx	aj00200	*now=know
2011-09-07T02:26:00.000Z	aj00200	coraxx	I think you understand the process from there. Of course, you will need to find a way to read/write usb data in your language
