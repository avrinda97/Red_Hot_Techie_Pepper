2009-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	edge		how can u remove packages manually without using apt-get bc it wont do it
2009-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	What are you trying to remove that apt-get wouldn't let you?
2009-02-08T07:26:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	IndyGunFreak it was installed with a .deb and the deb is gone, and i used i to remove it but it still things it exists so im having issues installing other stuff
2009-02-08T07:26:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	That is still very vague. Please pastebin the output when you are facing this problem
2009-02-08T07:28:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	sudo apt-get install -f, that should fix broken packages first
2009-02-08T07:30:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	that didn't work
2009-02-08T07:30:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	pastebin?

2009-02-08T07:30:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	no matter what i do i get that ,its annoying i just wanna edit it out of its memory
2009-02-08T07:31:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	What did, sudo apt-get install -f say?

2009-02-08T07:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	Can you actually go and download zimbra-core, and reinstall it?
2009-02-08T07:33:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	i could, but its not installed , so why can't i just remove it from the package manager?
2009-02-08T07:33:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	Some package depends on it, and apt-get wants to reinstall it due to some reason
2009-02-08T07:33:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	no way to over ride?
2009-02-08T07:33:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	But this behaviour is very weird, even for apt-get
2009-02-08T07:34:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	edge	It would be much easier if you went through the process of installation and removal
2009-02-08T07:34:00.000Z	edge	WebcamWonder	nothing relies on it , so im confused why i can't just delete it from a world list or something
