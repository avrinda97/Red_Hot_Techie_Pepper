2011-05-09T10:39:00.000Z	blaine_		yes
2011-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	blaine_		I'm on a livecd, and can mount my LVM just fine manually
2011-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	blaine_		yeah, for the livecd
2011-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	blaine_		not what's installed though
2011-05-09T10:43:00.000Z	blaine_		ah, I think I found it
2011-05-09T10:43:00.000Z	blaine_		EGuinn:
2011-05-09T10:45:00.000Z	blaine_		no grub folder to be found
2011-05-09T10:46:00.000Z	blaine_		looks like my grub is nuked
2011-05-09T10:47:00.000Z	blaine_		I'm hoping it's just as easy as re-installing grub >.<
2011-05-09T10:48:00.000Z	blaine_		I'm not sure, but I think I have to mount the root fs, and /proc, and chroot, and then sudo apt-get install grub... and configure as necessary
2011-05-09T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	You do *not* want to "apt-get install grub", that would install grub legacy.
2011-05-09T10:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	Can you try booting the server (without the liveCD) and holding shift during boot to get to the grub menu, then at the grub menu select an older kernel?
2011-05-09T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	It says that grub is not broken (though there is a chance that it's misconfigured, that'f fairly low).
2011-05-09T10:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	I doubt that your grub directory is gone.
2011-05-09T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	Ubuntu doesn't use initrd or vmlinuz symlinks.
2011-05-09T10:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	Yes.
2011-05-09T10:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blaine_	It's /etc/default/grub.
2011-05-09T10:57:00.000Z	blaine_	Jordan_U	no grub file there
