2006-03-20T16:14:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	the instructions on !restricted work the the sun jdk
2006-03-21T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	env | sort shows it
2006-03-21T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	according to packages.ubuntu.com, it's in universe on the amd64
2006-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	evince (or acroread)
2006-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	install it first
2006-03-22T06:42:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	you need to enable multiverse to get acroread
2006-03-22T06:43:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	could you post your /etc/apt/sources.list on a pastebin
2006-03-22T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	I don't see anything wrong with those sources (except maybe for security being commented, but thats not the issue here) I just tried downloading it, and got it.
2006-03-22T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	it's possible, but unlikely. Try removing tr. from each line it's in, and updating again. See what happens.
2006-03-22T06:54:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	removing tr. so you have deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy main restricted shouldn't get you an error (don't forget to update)
2006-03-22T06:56:00.000Z	nazgulwalker	nickrud	i tried those and i saw the same error ..
2006-03-22T06:56:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	how about pasting the error from the apt-get update?
2006-03-22T06:58:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	very strange, because this shows it should be there: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=acroread&searchon=names&subword=1&version=breezy&release=all
2006-03-22T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	use evince, and I would doubt it. You should have security enabled anyway on general principles
2006-03-22T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	are you on i386 ?
2006-03-22T07:04:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	I use i386, and assume everyone does, acroread is not there for amd64.
2006-03-22T07:05:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	I'll know to ask that next time
2006-04-20T16:01:00.000Z	nickrud	nazgulwalker	Cerveza what was that?
