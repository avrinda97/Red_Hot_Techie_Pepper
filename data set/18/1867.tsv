2010-10-15T03:24:00.000Z	`ak		so of course, now my apt repositories are screwed
2010-10-15T03:24:00.000Z	`ak		i can confirm that there is no net connection, not proxy, other repos work - but oddly enough NOT the ones I paid for
2010-10-15T03:25:00.000Z	`ak		Dual-boot windows/ubuntu is good for games
2010-10-15T03:25:00.000Z	`ak		wine gaming kinda sux
2010-10-15T03:26:00.000Z	`ak		but if you're playing windows games, dual boot is simply a better game experience
2010-10-15T03:27:00.000Z	`ak		amarok 1.4 ;)
2010-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	`ak		su root = bad ubutu juju
2010-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	`ak		but, being an old hand - i still do it to half of my systems
2010-10-15T03:28:00.000Z	`ak		but really forcing SUDO is a much better way to manage access etc
2010-10-15T03:29:00.000Z	`ak		and the first time you accidentally hit enter instead of tab when typing rm -rf : you'll be glad you weren't root
2010-10-15T03:29:00.000Z	gilaniali	`ak	so what would u suggest?
2010-10-15T03:29:00.000Z	`ak		Why do you need to be root for the moment?
2010-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	`ak		sadly, some software simply wants you to be root
2010-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	`ak		personally - after a year of trying I've gotten used to prepending everything with sudo
2010-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	gilaniali	`ak	i am trying to set up apache, and dont have to keep sudoing for the smallest thing
2010-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	`ak		or - if I have an install that really wants to be root - I enable it, then disable afterwards
2010-10-15T03:30:00.000Z	`ak	gilaniali	- is it a personal system?
2010-10-15T03:31:00.000Z	gilaniali	`ak	yup, a private vps
