2008-10-12T23:06:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech		Does anyone know how the repositories are going to handle OpenOffice.org 3.0? I've run the beta in Windows, and I like it a lot. So I'm wondering how long they will take to roll them in?
2008-10-12T23:08:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	have you tried OO3 in  alinux install? asking because I did, with an opensuse beta, and the experience was not exhilarating
2008-10-12T23:08:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	I have not yet.  Only windows so far.  And it is MUCH faster than 2.x.  Not to mention faster than MS Office 2007.
2008-10-12T23:09:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	good to know. i will venture another try
2008-10-12T23:09:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	the "pdf import" plugin is a big selling point for me
2008-10-12T23:10:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	Here's my situation. I'm the IT guy at a private school. about 150 computers.  We have vista running in our elm lab, our HS lab, elm library, and HS library.  All the rest of the computers, i'm giving heavy thoughts to moving to Ubuntu and OO.o.
2008-10-12T23:11:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	from my 48-hour testing experience with oo3 - it crashes. boy, does it crash often and badly. bu it did recover every single document afterwards
2008-10-12T23:11:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	The HS lab and library computers we just got 50 licenses for MS Office 2007, so the HS kids are familiar with what the collages are using. The rest of my students/staff just need something for homework and presentations.
2008-10-12T23:12:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	I haven't experianced a crash with OO3 on windows yet.  Very solid.  How long ago did you try it? I was using RC2.
2008-10-12T23:13:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	other than that, it does import msoffice 2007 docs, has a good powerpoint replacement, and finally can convert msaccess files
2008-10-12T23:13:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	a lot of good features
2008-10-12T23:14:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	I couldn't get it to recognize access files.  Maybe I have to go through some kind of import process.
2008-10-12T23:14:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	well duh
2008-10-12T23:14:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	I was hoping it would just pop them open like it does with word, excel, and powerpoint files.
2008-10-12T23:16:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	importing previous documents and applications will be a chore. do not expect a simple wizard to fix them all for you, too many features of msoffice are not common enough or documented enough to be present in oo
2008-10-12T23:17:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	well we don't use access at the school for anything.  I do have a guy i do some side work with, who had expressed interest in switching to Linux.  However, his access database and his Quickbooks needs are stopping me.
2008-10-12T23:18:00.000Z	Helminthe	Crusader_Tech	for each application and version, check the wine database, quickbooks has no nqtive linux equivalent, so: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=493
2008-10-12T23:19:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	Helminthe	I'm going to have to learn more about WINE.  I've seen guys do very intensive tasks in WINE, like running 3D games.  However when I try to use it, it struggles with programs a simple as notepad.
