2008-12-19T10:18:00.000Z	kevdog		need good irc client -- Recommendations?
2008-12-19T10:19:00.000Z	kevdog		Definitely going to check that out -- thanks for input
2008-12-19T10:19:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	Xchat. Or if you want something CLI, definitely irssi.
2008-12-19T10:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	He can't use the net.
2008-12-19T10:50:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	Put 'em in different workspaces.
2008-12-19T10:51:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	I shudder when I boot into Windows. Workspaces are a godsend.
2008-12-19T11:17:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	The very fact that you've been using linux for a long time makes you understand. Most people would end up doing something stupid as root.
2008-12-19T11:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	I don't think he's bringing the wireless interface down.
2008-12-19T11:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	That's google's address.
2008-12-19T11:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	Banged up DNS maybe?
2008-12-19T11:58:00.000Z	kevdog	tiyowan	dns for sure :0
2008-12-19T11:59:00.000Z	kevdog	tiyowan	Id try opendns servers since something is funky with his right now
2008-12-19T12:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	But it doesn't make sense. How come he's able to access sites through DNS using wireless and not wired?
2008-12-19T12:14:00.000Z	kevdog	tiyowan	 good point about the networking restart
2008-12-19T12:23:00.000Z	kevdog	tiyowan	Something is screwy here: both wired & wireless go through same router, but only in wireless case does the dns lookup work
2008-12-19T12:23:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	Check out the dhclient file.
2008-12-19T12:24:00.000Z	kevdog	tiyowan	OK -- Im not the one doing this
2008-12-19T12:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	kevdog	Agreed.
