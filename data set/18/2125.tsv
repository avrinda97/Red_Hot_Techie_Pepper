2010-08-13T19:27:00.000Z	Pacha		anyone here can give me a little help?
2010-08-13T19:29:00.000Z	Pacha		I had an ubuntu liveUSB in my pendrive, but unfortunatly it is not working for some strange reason. By running the compatibility mode, I can use the terminal, so Im trying to recover my files. The problem is that I am not being able to mount my windows partitions, where I want to put the recovered files.
2010-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	Pacha		anyway to know my partition ID without fdisk?
2010-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	Pacha		with ID I mean sdxx
2010-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	Pacha		hmm
