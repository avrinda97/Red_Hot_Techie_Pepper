2006-12-28T07:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	thats not an option ;)
2006-12-28T07:05:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	make sure it's a FAT32 fs... ?  :-)
2006-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	perhaps if you said which filesystem...
2006-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	xfs.
2006-12-28T07:06:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	sorry, don't know xfs. Anyone else?
2006-12-28T07:39:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	about the only one I know is CP/M
2006-12-28T07:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	whats that? O.o
2006-12-28T07:39:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	and I don't know if LInux has drivers for CP/M
2006-12-28T07:40:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	CP/M is "Control Program for Microprcessors" if memory serve me correctly. It was invented just before DOS and Gates ripped off CP/M to build DOS
2006-12-28T07:41:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	sound immensly usefull. :P fs limit of 256mb?
2006-12-28T07:41:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	I used it in the early 80s. Early Amstrad computers used it
2006-12-28T07:41:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	probably something around that, yes
2006-12-28T07:41:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	back then disks were 360K in size
2006-12-28T07:42:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	Most modern filesystems are case-sensitives. Windows just never grew up...
2006-12-28T07:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	neither did the windows games i try to run. hence the need :)
2006-12-28T07:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	BackPacker	if i, by chance (or hacking some ugly fuse module), find a way - would it break anything mounting my entire /home as case insensitive?
2006-12-28T07:45:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	I don't know. It would break for me, cos I use KDE which relies on some files in ~
2006-12-28T07:45:00.000Z	BackPacker	nolimitsoya	but I can't guess how you'd do that anyway
