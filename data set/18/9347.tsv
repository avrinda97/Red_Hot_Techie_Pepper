2007-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	benanzo		I have two kernels installed, can I compile software for both at the same time?  or do I need to boot into each in order to compile a package for it?
2007-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	depends on the software's dependencies
2007-09-11T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	better to use a running config
2007-09-11T14:51:00.000Z	benanzo	ikonia	OK thanks
2007-09-11T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	he wants his server to issue them
2007-09-11T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	exactly
2007-09-11T15:05:00.000Z	benanzo	ikonia	is the order of the items in dhclient.conf sensitive?  for instance, is it the same to have the "prepend domain-name-servers" line before/after the "request .." line?  that might make a difference.
2007-09-11T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	some are
2008-04-15T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	xlock isn't it
2008-04-15T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	ahh well done
2008-04-28T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	thats not practical as the .deb packages go to hardcoded destinations
2008-04-28T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	won't work, that path is hardcoded
2008-04-28T21:03:00.000Z	benanzo	ikonia	Yes I know it's hard coded -- I'm talking about changing it so it's still hard coded by the paths can change dynamically depending on if it's sudo/root installing or limited user
2008-04-28T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	you can't do that
2008-04-28T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	thats not how the package managment works (or could work)
2008-04-28T21:06:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	it's up to system administrators to repackage
2008-04-28T21:06:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	no it doesn't
2008-04-28T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	benanzo	thats not every enterprise OS
