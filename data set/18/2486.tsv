2011-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	|Anthony|		i have an *apparently* bad usb flash drive. It shows up in win 7 but isn't formated. It doesn't show up in ubuntu 10.04. Is there somewhere else i can look to see it?
2011-11-06T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 there data on it you wanted to keep? or is it brand new?
2011-11-06T06:43:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	yeah
2011-11-06T06:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 unplug,plug it back in, check dmesg again. if its not even getting assigned a /dev/sdXX entry - it may be totally dead.
2011-11-06T06:46:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	I've been looking in /dev and there's nothing
2011-11-06T06:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 thats not a good sign. :(
2011-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 odd that it shows up in windows.. could be its showing up sometimes.. but not others..
2011-11-06T06:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 time to back it up.. fast.. :)
2011-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	you still here?
2012-01-06T23:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 what FS is it using?
2012-01-06T23:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 as far as i know, you dont override the exec, or rw permissions on an ext2/3/4 filesystem via mount options.
2012-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	i just opend synaptic and typed 7z
2012-01-27T08:44:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	fileroler wasn't handling it :/
2012-01-27T08:45:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	i was just looking in synaptic to see what the suggested installs were
2012-09-26T19:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 i wouldent advise it.  many apps can be set to use alsa dire3ctly if needed
2012-09-26T19:30:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	MonkeyDust: the only reason i'm even thinking about it as a solution is cause i'm experimenting with multiseat. It seems that the only way i can get each seat to have audio is if i run pulse as a system-wide instance instead of per user.
2012-09-26T19:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	|Anthony|	 no idea on multiseat, sorry. thats a 'cutting edge' sort of thing. ;)
2012-09-26T19:31:00.000Z	|Anthony|	dr_willis	MonkeyDust: i have it working ok for me, but i want to update https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultiseatX for 12.04 and have a more complete solution for audio.
