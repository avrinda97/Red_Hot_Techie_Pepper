2008-07-13T07:49:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	Bodsda, cirkit: hold on a sec let me recompile that driver brb
2008-07-13T07:42:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	you can but why do you want to remove drivers from the kernel?
2008-07-13T07:43:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	no need if i am running it on a laptop so how do you check ?
2008-07-13T07:43:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	not true.
2008-07-13T07:43:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	how so ?
2008-07-13T07:43:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	lshw for example. you are also STRONGLY discouraged to compile your own kernel
2008-07-13T07:44:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	i am not going to need b43 dirvers or realtek etc
2008-07-13T07:44:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	it takes a few MB for modules and that all but you become a lot more flexible and your question shows you don't know much about kernels or compiling or such either which means there is a high failure of borking it
2008-07-13T07:44:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	just don't ask here when your kernel breaks please
2008-07-13T07:45:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	fine enough
2008-07-13T07:45:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	the thing is i tried installing the newest compat drivers becuase the ubuntu ones are a lil falty for my iwl4956 and i get a module error thats why i want to compile a new kernel
2008-07-13T07:48:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	where did you get that 4965 module exactly?
2008-07-13T07:48:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	and that is what?
2008-07-13T07:48:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	google
2008-07-13T07:48:00.000Z	wols	krsnadasa	exact error please
2008-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	Bodsda, cirkit: http://paste.ubuntu.com/26991/ is the error
2008-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	Bodsda, cirkit: http://paste.ubuntu.com/26992/ is the dmsg
2008-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	krsnadasa	wols	cirkit: does that mean i have to recompile kernel ?
