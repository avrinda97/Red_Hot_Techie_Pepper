2012-03-09T16:09:00.000Z	Tm_T	shabbir	I tried to ask what package you installed and how
2012-03-09T16:11:00.000Z	shabbir	Tm_T	Oh Sorry, i searched for how to install drupal on ubuntu and in that i found this "sudo apt-get install apache2 php5-mysql php5-gd libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server"
2012-03-09T16:11:00.000Z	Tm_T		ah, good, so all is well then (:
2012-03-09T16:12:00.000Z	Tm_T	shabbir	when your commandline is on /var/www/
2012-03-09T16:13:00.000Z	Tm_T	shabbir	do "sudo unzip drupal/drupal-6.25.zip"
2012-03-09T16:13:00.000Z	Tm_T		after that you prolly want to change the owner of the folder that is created
2012-03-09T16:15:00.000Z	shabbir	Tm_T	Thanks, done till that, next question how do you do that, i know u do it by sayin " sudo chown" but can you please give me the full command
2012-03-09T16:16:00.000Z	Tm_T	shabbir	"sudo chown www-data -R /var/www/drupal*"
