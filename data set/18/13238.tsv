2006-05-19T11:41:00.000Z	bradley_		hi. i need some help setting up DMA data transfer-- does anyone know stuff about DMA?
2006-05-19T11:42:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	which drive are you trying to enable it on?
2006-05-19T11:44:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	i was playing a dvd and it was choppy so i checked out the wiki on dvd's and it sent me to the DMA page and i tried to follow those directions but it didn't work. so i guess the short answer would be that i am trying to enable my cd/dvd drive. (?)
2006-05-19T11:45:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	what kind of error did you get?
2006-05-19T11:47:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	try /dev/dvd
2006-05-19T11:48:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	okay
2006-05-19T11:49:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	what kind of video card do you have/
2006-05-19T11:49:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	well it did something... so that must be closer, but it said: HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
2006-05-19T11:50:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	what was the exact command you ran/
2006-05-19T11:52:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	i have a nvidia geforce4 (i not sure if the spelling of that is right but that is the sentiment of it)
2006-05-19T11:53:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	the command line was: bradley@homey:~$ sudo hdparm /dev/dvd
2006-05-19T11:53:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	sorry I think I meant to direct that question to someone else, about the video card
2006-05-19T11:53:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	and it just outputted that error?
2006-05-19T11:54:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	then i ran: sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/dvd
2006-05-19T11:56:00.000Z	NoUse	bradley_	yeah and you can edit /etc/hdparm.conf to make sure that gets set at boot
2006-05-19T11:58:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	do you think that was right? do i have to do the same thing for cd's?
2006-05-19T12:08:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	before i save any changes to hdparm.conf i have two questions: 1. everything line before it begins with #, should i add that at the beginning of the lines that i add too? 2. if /dev/dvd worked to set DMA in the terminal i would use that in hdparm.conf instead of the dev/hdc right?
2006-05-19T12:10:00.000Z	bradley_	NoUse	okay thanks
