2006-03-21T13:34:00.000Z	rob138		does anyone know what would keep changing my dns servers address?
2006-03-21T13:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	you using DHCP or ppp ?
2006-03-21T13:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	well, probly the dhcp server, for some strange reason, hands you a different DNS server each time - odd, but not illegal
2006-03-21T13:36:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	it is an old DNS, from a previous wireless connection that i was on, the current wireless i am on's dns server keeps gettin overwritten
2006-03-21T13:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	do you think your connection is dropping out & keeps swapping between APs ?
2006-03-21T13:37:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	i highly doubt it
2006-03-21T13:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	once DHCP has brought up the link, the dns won't change
2006-03-21T13:38:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	what do you mean?
2006-03-21T13:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	when you bring up dhcp, it will write the dns server to /etc/resolv.conf - if this file keeps changing, it's because your dhcp client keeps reconnecting
2006-03-21T13:40:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	okay, then how come dhcp keeps gettin an old wireless dns server, that i am completely out of range from
2006-03-21T13:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	I imagine that the old /etc/resolv.conf has the old wifi setting - when the dhcp client brings the connection up, it overwrites /etc/resolv.conf - then the connection drops out, and the old /etc/resolv.conf is moved back into place
2006-03-21T13:42:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	i have resolve.conf and resolve.conf~ , would do you mean that it is using the second one to rpleace the first one?
2006-03-21T13:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	try 'locate resolv.conf'
2006-03-21T13:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	not sure - can't test dhcp from here - I'm wondering if resolv.conf~ is just a leftover editor temp file?
2006-03-21T13:48:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	if it was, what would that mean?
2006-03-21T13:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	it would mean it's storing the old resolv.conf somewhere else, for instance, pppd uses /etc/resolv.conf.pppd-backup
2006-03-21T13:49:00.000Z	rob138	Frogzoo	okay...
2006-03-21T13:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rob138	so I think your wireless is dropping out - I'd be looking for radio strength & checking /var/log/messages for reconnects
