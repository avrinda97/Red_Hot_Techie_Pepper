2006-06-09T11:02:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	Using aptitude will make sure you don't get loads of unneeded packages installed after you remove something (KDE depends on lots of things that GNOME doesn't use)
2006-06-09T11:03:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	nvu
2006-06-09T11:03:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	apt-get install nvu
2006-06-09T11:04:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	Is there one that doesn't have WYSIWYG in it?
2006-06-09T11:04:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	Screem I think
2006-06-09T11:04:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	or bluefish
2006-06-09T11:05:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	Can I install Bluefish by sudo apt-get install bluefish
2006-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	Yes (I think)
2006-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	That is GUI, but not WYSIWYG
2006-06-09T11:06:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	What is bluefish's Website?
2006-06-09T11:07:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	Their site is http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=bluefish&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
2006-06-09T11:09:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	Bluefish looks like a nice editor
2006-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	I hate coding html. I like nvu :)
2006-06-09T11:10:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	I really don't like NVU's way of writing in the code, I like HTML.
2006-06-09T11:11:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	HTML is easier for me rather than figuring out a WYSIWYG program
2006-06-09T11:11:00.000Z	Warbo	opitwin	:) (nvu is basically the same as Mozilla Composer, but in GTK, so I know it's layout anyway)
2006-06-09T11:11:00.000Z	opitwin	Warbo	Thanks for your help
