2006-12-27T16:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Hello?!
2006-12-27T16:19:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		WHY DO YOU SAY "MERRY XMAS" BUT YOU DON'T HELP ME WITH MY PRINTER?
2006-12-27T16:20:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	chill.  It's entirely possible that nobody active at the moment knows how to make your printer work.
2007-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	'sudo hdparm /dev/hd*' | grep using_dma' and make sure dma is on on all your disks
2007-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	it shouldn't be.  That command took me a good fraction of a second to run
2007-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Asc	I'm talking Pentium MMX 266mhz 2GB HD 172MB RAM
2007-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Okay, but still not more than a few seconds probably
2007-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Might be worth checking the spelling. "sudo hdparm /dev/hd* | grep using_dma"
2007-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	HAve you tried any other players?
2007-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	just for fun, use the console to run mplayer on one of the files
2007-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Could be tricky, we're using different kernels.
2007-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Asc	How do you know?  And where can I get a command line player.
2007-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	I think it should come with a standard install.  'mplayer filename'
2007-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	I'm using a kernel compiled for 686, which wouldn't work on your hardware.
2007-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Do you have spare disk space to play with?
2007-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Asc	like 500mb
2007-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	madplay is in the repositories.  'sudo apt-get install madplay'
2007-01-01T09:19:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	You can also use 'sudo apt-get install mplayer' to get mplayer, but it's a 3.5 MB download.
