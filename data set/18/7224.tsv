2008-02-03T02:21:00.000Z	Frostydecide		Is there a way to force flash drives to be bootable in ubuntu?
2008-02-03T02:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	It's in your BIOS.
2008-02-03T02:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Not Ubuntu.
2008-02-03T02:23:00.000Z	Frostydecide	MrObvious	Yeah but it still wont boot from them unless its bootable. Im trying to boot a file which you would usually put to a floppy disk and tick the "make bootable" button while formatting.
2008-02-03T02:23:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Ahh. Why do you need this file? I'm curious.
2008-02-03T02:24:00.000Z	Frostydecide	MrObvious	its a .bat I need to run to update my motherboard.
2008-02-03T02:24:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Oh a BIOS update?
2008-02-03T02:25:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	You could try using Google and putting in bootable USB drive
2008-02-03T02:26:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Hmm. Maybe you'll have to do something like that. :\
2008-02-03T02:27:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Can you burn an ISO or something? Try Google USB BIOS update
2008-02-03T02:27:00.000Z	Frostydecide	MrObvious	Im running into the same problem there. I can't work out how to force a disk to be bootable when i burn it in ubuntu
2008-02-03T02:28:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	I wish I knew what to do :(.
2008-02-03T02:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Do you dual boot with Windows?
2008-02-03T02:30:00.000Z	Frostydecide	MrObvious	I did... I just formatted my windows drive for the first time since getting this motherboard. So thats when the prob started.
2008-02-03T02:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	If you have a spare hard drive remove your current one, run a Windows install or something. :\
2008-02-03T02:31:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	You're welcome. I tried.
2008-02-03T02:32:00.000Z	MrObvious	Frostydecide	Lemme ask some people who visit another site who are overclockers and they might have an idea.
