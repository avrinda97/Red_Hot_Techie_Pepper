2007-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	anonymeeee		 i'm trying to install ubuntu on a box that presently has an older version of suse....I can't get the blasted thing to boot from the cdrom
2007-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	anonymeeee		keeps going to suse
2007-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	check your BIOS boot order
2007-03-07T11:34:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	my boot order is cdrom cdrom hdd1
2007-03-07T11:35:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	it's still going to the grub os loader
2007-03-07T11:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	but it won't boot from the CD? Did you burn the ISO properly/check md5sum/etc?
2007-03-07T11:35:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	the cd loaded just fine on another computer
2007-03-07T11:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	odd. have you gotten this computer to boot from other CDs in the past?
2007-03-07T11:36:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	ya, that's how I got suse on it
2007-03-07T11:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	that's screwy. try another CD-R and burn again? I really am not sure what to suggest if the CD works elsewhere and other CDs have worked in this machine before - have you tweaked the BIOS settings since installing Suse?
2007-03-07T11:39:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	 haven't done anything to the bios
2007-03-07T11:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	in that case, it should just work. No idea why it isnt.
2007-03-07T11:56:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	I've taken the drive out of the box and put it in a usb drive case
2007-03-07T11:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	if that works, cool.
2007-03-07T11:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	does the box boot from CD now that it's connected by USB?
2007-03-07T11:59:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	no, I have it attached to this box now...different box
2007-03-07T11:59:00.000Z	anonymeeee	Madpilot	I attached the usb drive to my working ubuntu box
2007-03-07T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	anonymeeee	I'm really not sure what to suggest. You can use non-CD methods to install Ubuntu, but I've never used any of them
