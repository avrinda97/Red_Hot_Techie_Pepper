2005-09-13T10:44:00.000Z	kalias		How are com ports labeled in unix land?  Are they ttys0 and ttys1?
2005-09-13T10:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	yes
2005-09-13T10:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	Well, capital S
2005-09-13T10:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	Driver not loaded?
2005-09-13T10:48:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	That is a good question.  I don't know how to tell.
2005-09-13T10:51:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	I typed "ps - a" and it came back with 8312 pts/0 00:00:00 ps.  Is this good?
2005-09-13T10:51:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	/dev/pts/0 is where you're logged in./
2005-09-13T10:53:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	okay that was a silly question :(  Sorry.
2005-09-13T10:59:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	How do I tell what the com ports are mapped to and if the drivers are running?
2005-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	'dmesg' should show you if the drivers are loaded (and what the ports are).
2005-09-13T11:04:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	Okay, I see no reference in there to tty.  Does this mean the drivers are not loaded?
2005-09-13T11:05:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	indeed. I'm fairly sure 'modprobe serial' ought to load 'em.
2005-09-13T11:05:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	Bad news. Module serial not found.
2005-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalias	woo!
2005-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	Hmmm..that does not sound good :(
2005-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	I checked my installed software and there doesn't appear to be any serial installed.
2005-09-13T11:16:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	 Maybe I need to install one of the serial module in synaptic?
2005-09-13T11:28:00.000Z	kalias	cafuego_	 You still there?
