2006-08-19T12:41:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 Your understanding of security is flawed if you think having a traditional root password known by anyone is MORE secure than only one user with full sudo.
2006-08-19T12:42:00.000Z	tambu	Tamale	sigh.. I never once said you give people access to root :) I said you have a root account.. and for those users who need slightly more access you use a sudo list to grant them that.. rather than full root access
2006-08-19T12:47:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 if your password is a dictionary word or something else really poorly chosen, only then you have a valid concern.  if this is the case, then by all means enable the root account and take away your user's full sudo privs
2006-08-19T12:48:00.000Z	tambu	Tamale	two passwords are always more secure there are any number of hacks /key loggers that may log my password if my system gets compromised. but if my account password is compromised hard password or not.. then my whole system is compromised as the user can sudo and get full privs.
2006-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 i'm sorry, but that logic is completely wrong.
2006-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 Password security is exponential in  nature
2006-08-19T12:52:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 good passwords are quite secure in a realm where guessing can only be done in a slowed down, protected manner
2006-08-19T12:53:00.000Z	tambu	Tamale	yes perhaps a "good" password is... do you really think that everyone out there uses a "good" password and a different "good" password everywhere?
2006-08-19T12:54:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 I agree.. but think the emphasis should be placed on having people choose good passwords during the ubuntu install rather than enabling root.
2006-08-19T12:55:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 Consider this:  if someone is prone to choosing bad passwords, won't they choose a bad password for both their own account AND root?
2006-08-19T12:55:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 possibly even WORSE since they have to remember two now
2006-08-19T12:55:00.000Z	tambu	Tamale	by your same argument then they would have chosen that same bad password for their single login to ubuntu.. so yes two bad passwords are still better than 1 bad password.
2006-08-19T12:56:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 It's insecure either way
2006-08-19T12:56:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 which is why i'm arguing more emphasis should be placed on having people choose good passwords rather than changing the password structure
2006-08-19T12:56:00.000Z	tambu	Tamale	insecure yes.. more secure at least though.
2006-08-19T12:59:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 i'm asking you to re-think that added option from the ubuntu developers standpoint..  it will only confuse people
2006-08-19T12:59:00.000Z	Tamale	tambu	 and it's "added security" of the more traditional method is only a false-sense of added security that's paltry in comparison to the teaching of the importance of good passwords
