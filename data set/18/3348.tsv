2011-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	you are wanting the hdmi sound I assume?
2011-12-10T08:37:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	just some sound. i've tried setting the primary driver to both my speakers and my internal audio. i get nothing
2011-12-10T08:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	you tried doing this thru the gui or did you go all script-warrior on it?
2011-12-10T08:39:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	just tried alsamixer
2011-12-10T08:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	what version of ubuntu? btw, alsamixer is not the default setup for sound in ubuntu
2011-12-10T08:43:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	i'm using kubuntu oneriic
2011-12-10T08:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	I am not sure what the gui looks like for sound config on kubuntu, this much should hold true, seems like you got two pieces of sound 'hardware' one analog the other digital-hdmi, the analog should be simple, the hdmi has multiple options (profiles), one of those will provide you with sound via hdmi cable
2011-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	correct. i just discovered that pulseaudio jacked the soundsystem. it wasn't alsa
2011-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	or mabye i just set it as thus by accident
2011-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	pulse jacked the sound on ubuntu since the cows left the barn, good luck getting all alsa pure with it
2011-12-10T08:51:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	haha
2011-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	so how do i make it work for applications?
2011-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	I have both hdmi and analog sound being catered by pulse on my home entertainment system, it works just fine, the old days of pulse sucking or breaking are over
2011-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	ah cool :)
2011-12-10T08:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	poyntz	it would be there as your default sound if you indeed are running kubuntu virgin
2011-12-10T08:55:00.000Z	poyntz	almoxarife	at the moment it's not
