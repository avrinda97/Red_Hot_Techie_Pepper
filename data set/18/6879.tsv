2008-03-09T17:01:00.000Z	linuxius		hello! is there anyone who can help me with an NVIDIA problem?
2008-03-09T17:02:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	what's the problem :)
2008-03-09T17:05:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	you've tried the restricted driver :) ?
2008-03-09T17:11:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	applying the changes to /etc/X11/xorg.conf should make sure  starts with the right config :)
2008-03-09T17:11:00.000Z	linuxius	ThaRabbit	what do you mean by that?
2008-03-09T17:12:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	well, you say you have to restart X after each reboot with a new xorg.conf file
2008-03-09T17:12:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	the main config file is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-03-09T17:12:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	ah, eny... it's a geforce 440 right?
2008-03-09T17:13:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	try "nv" as driver :)
2008-03-09T17:14:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	and you've tried the restricted driver?
2008-03-09T17:14:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	via the restricted driver manager... not via envy
2008-03-09T17:16:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	ok, apparantly the 440 isn't supported by the unified driver anymore :(
2008-03-09T17:18:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	checking up on some stuff, one moment :)
2008-03-09T17:21:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	the restricted manager should offer you a legacy driver for your card
2008-03-09T17:22:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	the manager is under system -> maintainance... you need the nvidia-glx-legacy package :)
2008-03-09T17:23:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	with the "nvidia" driver listed in your xorg.conf file, quality is bad with the nvidia-glx-legacy driver?
2008-03-09T17:24:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	then I can not suggest a better sollution, you could try the legacy drivers from the nvidia website :)
2008-03-09T17:29:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	linuxius	perhaps this can help you further - http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?f=14
