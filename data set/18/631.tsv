2011-12-26T12:48:00.000Z	Raliegh		Whhhhyyy? Whhhhyyyy VLC? Why u work on Windows but not Ubuntu?
2011-12-26T12:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	how did you install vlc?
2011-12-26T13:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	run this in terminal, pastebin the result            vlc -l | grep shout
2011-12-27T05:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	sort of spelled out, you created a dependency with linux-image-generic, that would be the latest image, yet the latest image is not configured, perhaps you need to correct that first
2011-12-27T05:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	I have a wonderful thought, uninstall linux-image-generic, you stay at the current kernel you are at, and when you decide you want to update then you fix the dependency?
2011-12-27T05:22:00.000Z	Raliegh	almoxarife	I'm not going to lie, all that was gibberish to me. I know nothing about kernels, nor why I'd have to uninstall anything, nor why I would have to update (or even what to update/how).
2011-12-27T05:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	I find it hard to believe you don't know about kernels and stuff, you got the 'grep' thing down, you decide, use the kernel(that would be the thing that was running to give you that error(and it was working), or you fix the dependency, to not do a thing you do need to uninstall linux-image-generic
2011-12-27T05:26:00.000Z	Raliegh	almoxarife	I really don't. I'm just following commands given here and on the wonderful spirit of Google.
2011-12-27T10:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	what version of ubuntu?
2011-12-27T10:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	you added a ppa for liquidsoap?
2011-12-27T10:56:00.000Z	Raliegh	almoxarife	PPA? What's that? I'm just trying "apt-get install liquidsoap", being met with 4 dependancy errors that aren't fixed when I install those dependencies.
2011-12-27T11:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	according to 'synaptic' ( something a bit more useful than cli) on my 11.04 liquidsoap depends on libao4, yet your pastebin says nothing about it, you on 11.04?
2011-12-27T11:10:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	do you just have an aversion to a gui for installing apps? you might consider doing the apt-get thing and install 'synaptic' , might as well see all that stuff you can't see on a terminal
2011-12-27T11:11:00.000Z	Raliegh	almoxarife	I sure do, it's called unecessary space/RAM useage
2011-12-27T11:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	got it, server or desktop?
2011-12-27T12:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	perhaps you have over-stayed your welcome, I for one am done with you, in the kindest most sincere way
2011-12-28T15:00:00.000Z	Raliegh	almoxarife	thanks thanks. Many days of splitting headaches, but I'm moving on
2011-12-28T15:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	Raliegh	wrong nick
