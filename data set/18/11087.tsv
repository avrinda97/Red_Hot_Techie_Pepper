2006-09-16T07:41:00.000Z	SillyZ		could be the tracker thats being used, the number of folks on that tracker thats actually uploading, and or if you connected to multiple networks or not
2006-09-16T07:41:00.000Z	SillyZ		What torrent application are you using?
2006-09-16T07:41:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	official client as well as qBittorrent
2006-09-16T07:42:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	try azureus
2006-09-16T07:42:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	there are over 2500 seeds and almost 20k leechers :)
2006-09-16T07:42:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	can't do, the system is very short on resources
2006-09-16T07:44:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	that doesn't solve my problem in any way
2006-09-16T07:44:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	nope :)
2006-09-16T07:45:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	no probs :) never had any problems with torrents when using uTorrent
2006-09-16T07:45:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	yes, they are
2006-09-16T07:46:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	k, just checking
2006-09-16T07:46:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	what kinda speed you getting?
2006-09-16T07:46:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	d/l - 2 - 3 kBps, upload - 14 kBps (user setting)
2006-09-16T07:47:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	and theres over 2500 connected and your getting that low of a speed?.... do you have encryption enabled?
2006-09-16T07:47:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	nope, no encryption
2006-09-16T07:47:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	that might be half the problem right there being unable to connect to clients that reuqire encryption
2006-09-16T07:48:00.000Z	psynaps3	SillyZ	ah, do is encryption enabled by default on uTorrent? because i didn't make any changes with uTorrent that i can think of
2006-09-16T07:48:00.000Z	SillyZ	psynaps3	join #sillyz we can take this over there
