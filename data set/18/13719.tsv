2010-11-16T07:25:00.000Z	mihai_		does anyone know what is the reason for slow loading webpages ? i noticed it happening after 3-4 hours of system uptime,pages like youtube take up to 3-5 mins to load or sometimes it just doesn`t load at all,even google.com takes 1-3 mins to load And i noticed everything going back to normal after i reboot,at least for another 3-4 hours. i`m using ubuntu 10.10
2010-11-16T07:26:00.000Z	mihai_		no
2010-11-16T07:27:00.000Z	mihai_		it`s probably been 3 days since i last rebooted my router
2010-11-16T07:27:00.000Z	mihai_		yes,tested with bout chrome and firefox
2010-11-16T07:27:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	thats a good one i knoe there suggesting alot but sounds like some sort of networking isue
2010-11-16T07:28:00.000Z	mihai_	gogeta	it works just fine after i reboot
2010-11-16T07:28:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	it sounds like the driver is having problems coming back from being inactiv
2010-11-16T07:29:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	well wifi can be buggy if its a lan its another problem
2010-11-16T07:30:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	cuple says of doing that
2010-11-16T07:31:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	well something in the network yea
2010-11-16T07:32:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	genrely a craling nic = network conflict
2010-11-16T07:32:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	nic drivers all work fine
2010-11-16T07:32:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	im thinking conflict
2010-11-16T07:33:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	just strange it starts hrs later
2010-11-16T07:34:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	normaly a nic well slow to being slow if 2 pcs are rying to use the same subnet or ip
2010-11-16T07:36:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	has the connecting been stable for those 2 days
2010-11-16T07:38:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	thats a good one nic slowing but only after time has passed normal a conflict is visable immadly
2010-11-16T07:40:00.000Z	gogeta	mihai_	worth a try
