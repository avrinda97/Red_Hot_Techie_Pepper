2011-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	xissburg		hm so..I currently have a kinda messed up system. I have (or had) Windows XP in C: (considered the main partition somhow) and Windows 7 x64 in D: . I'd like to format the whole disk and install Ubuntu and reinstall Windows 7 x64. What is the best approach?
2011-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	xissburg		dual boot win7 and ubunut
2011-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	xissburg		*ubuntu *-.-

2011-05-10T06:09:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	backup, repartition with the livecd, install windows first, then install ubuntu
2011-05-10T06:09:00.000Z	xissburg	escott	hmh
2011-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	unless you think/want to try and salvage the current system thats the recommend order for things
2011-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	xissburg	escott	livecd? you mean the Ubuntu Live CD ?
2011-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	yes
2011-05-10T06:11:00.000Z	xissburg	escott	Ah I still have a third E: partition which is not bootable, I  just store files in it
2011-05-10T06:11:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	then just don't touch that while you repartition
2011-05-10T06:14:00.000Z	xissburg	escott	dumb noob question: the ubuntu installation download supports the live cd feature?
2011-05-10T06:14:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	yes
2011-05-10T08:37:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	the install cd has a memory tester on it as an alternate boot option
2011-05-10T08:38:00.000Z	xissburg	escott	you mean this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MemoryTest?
2011-05-10T08:39:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	yes
2011-05-11T06:48:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	windows will probably want to do its own formatting, but you can format if you want
2011-05-11T07:04:00.000Z	escott	xissburg	yes fat is the most widely supported, and least featureful fs
