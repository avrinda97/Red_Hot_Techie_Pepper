2007-06-14T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	F00BaR`	do sudo ifconfig -a       do you see the interface ?
2007-06-14T15:50:00.000Z	F00BaR`	ikonia	yes
2007-06-14T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	F00BaR`	ok - so ubuntu can see the card. Use the system --> admin ---> networking gui to set an ip
2007-06-14T15:51:00.000Z	F00BaR`	ikonia	yes it shows up
2007-06-14T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	F00BaR`	ok - so your network card is fine
2007-06-14T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	F00BaR`	we have looked at this and it DOES recognise it
2007-06-14T15:57:00.000Z	F00BaR`	ikonia	so why cant i internet
2007-06-14T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	F00BaR`	because you've not set your card up with the correct ip / dns / route ?
