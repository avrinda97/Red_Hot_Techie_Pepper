2007-10-06T13:17:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Hey!
2007-10-06T13:18:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Okay. I'm helping jessica with this too.
2007-10-06T13:18:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Download this please: http://downloads.openwrt.org/sources/wl_apsta-3.130.20.0.o
2007-10-06T13:19:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter and say no to downloading firmware.
2007-10-06T13:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	cd ~/Desktop && sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter (the filename I had you download ending in .o)
2007-10-06T13:21:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Sorry I'm multitasking. :\
2007-10-06T13:22:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Only cd ~/directory/to/file/you/downloaded
2007-10-06T13:23:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Hmm now I forget what to do.
2007-10-06T13:25:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	jessica: Let me find the guide to install fwcutter. Give me a minute please.
2007-10-06T13:27:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	jessica: Try modprobe bcm43xx and see if the wireless manager.
2007-10-06T13:27:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Thanks for that.
2007-10-06T13:28:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	jessica: If it works but when you reboot it doesn't, just simply do a modprobe bcm43xx. Make sure you leave the files on your desktop.
2007-10-06T13:29:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Does the network manager see it? It's on the taskbar thingy.
2007-10-06T13:30:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	jessica: Crap. We are very close. What step am I missing??????????
2007-10-06T13:31:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	jessica: What does lsmod | grep bcm output?
2007-10-06T13:32:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Does your output match that?
2007-10-06T13:33:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeroen_	Did your output match jessica's output?
