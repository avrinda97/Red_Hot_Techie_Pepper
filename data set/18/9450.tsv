2007-04-17T09:19:00.000Z	big_bang14		vlc gives me "(no video)" when trying to view an avi divx. why is this? should i try mplayer instead?
2007-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	did you try mplayer yet?
2007-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	no
2007-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	then do so :/
2007-04-17T09:21:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	do you know why it does that though?
2007-04-17T09:22:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	there are a lot of possible reasons.
2007-04-17T09:22:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	hmm...
2007-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	is mplayer generaly a safer bet?
2007-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	tell me when youve actually tried mplayer
2007-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	i had the problem before on another pc
2007-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	PC w/Linux?
2007-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	linux
2007-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	wait, wait, you said DIVX AVI?
2007-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	i had resolved it but cant remember how and it was with quicktime instead of divx
2007-04-17T09:26:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	yes
2007-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	its nearly worked! i shall remember in future: vlc<mplayer, all i have to do know i think is un install totem because it gives me a message about totem being unable to play the file
2007-04-17T09:47:00.000Z	SonicChao	big_bang14	sorry for not checking my #ubuntu messages. I was helping someone in #amsn
2007-04-17T10:03:00.000Z	big_bang14	SonicChao	worked
