2006-02-21T15:24:00.000Z	Scarborough		my firefox window closes from time to time by itself
2006-02-21T15:24:00.000Z	Scarborough		why is that?
2006-02-21T15:24:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	hmm, maybe its an extension or plugin problem?
2006-02-21T15:25:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	and what version of firefox?
2006-02-21T15:25:00.000Z	Scarborough	nanotube	its the latest one, but I dont have any plugins or extensions, exept fasterfox
2006-02-21T15:25:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	hmm, well, it may be fasterfox. cuz ive never heard of that extension, and do not have it. :)
2006-02-21T15:26:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	try disabling fasterfox, and see if the random crashes go away, thats all i can suggest
2006-02-21T15:26:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	but its just a guess :)
2006-02-21T15:26:00.000Z	Scarborough	nanotube	its supposed to speed up ff, but i doubt that it works
2006-02-21T15:27:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	hehe yea, try disabling, see what happens.
2006-02-21T15:27:00.000Z	Scarborough	nanotube	done, now lets see what happens
2006-02-21T15:27:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	yep... how frequently does it usually restart?
2006-02-21T15:28:00.000Z	Scarborough	nanotube	like two-three times an hour
2006-02-21T15:30:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	then you dont have long to wait :)
2006-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	Scarborough	nanotube	what do you think about antivirus/spywere in ubuntu, do I need it?
2006-02-21T15:31:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	well, ive given that some research and thought myself... and come to the conclusion that it is not needed.
2006-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	antivir, for sure, because there are no viruses for linux in the wild, so it would just be sitting there eating resources and not doing anything
2006-02-21T15:32:00.000Z	nanotube	Scarborough	spyware might not be completely useless, cuz them spyware people can come up with some pretty mean things... but if you just install stuff from repos or other reputable sources, dont really need it either.
