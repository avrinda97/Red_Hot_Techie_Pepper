2011-10-07T07:17:00.000Z	oderfene	fullmetal	 OH are you not supposed to write .tar.bz2 into the command line?
2011-10-07T07:17:00.000Z	oderfene	fullmetal	 hold on though the filename has those two markers at the end of it though becuase it's zipped
2011-10-07T07:18:00.000Z	oderfene	fullmetal	 should I include the .tar.bz2 part in the commandline as well? because the ls -a didn't show that part
