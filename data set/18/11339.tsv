2006-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	Chris_	Chris0r	could you be a little more specific?
2006-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	Chris0r		when you type reboot in console, it broadcasts a message to every user
2006-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	Chris0r		i want to do that.
2006-08-10T08:54:00.000Z	Chris_	Chris0r	in that case apt-get install wall => man wall - it does exactly what you want
2006-08-10T08:54:00.000Z	Chris0r		wall: can't read hm.
2006-08-10T08:56:00.000Z	Chris0r	Chris_	wall: can't read hm.
2006-08-10T08:56:00.000Z	Chris_	Chris0r	vim foo => type in your message => wall foo!
2006-08-10T08:57:00.000Z	Chris0r		i have to make it read from a file?|:
2006-08-10T08:57:00.000Z	Chris_	Chris0r	yep, for other features and arguments I strongly recommend man wall
