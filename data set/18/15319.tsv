2005-04-13T16:58:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		ok.. i'm either more tired than i thought or losing my mind.. anyone happen to know off hand where exactly the article is about upgrading to hoary?
2005-04-13T05:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	please note that those notes are by no means complete or authoritative
2005-04-13T05:04:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	understood.. so where might one find an authoritative and complete reference guide to upgrading to hoary?
2005-04-13T05:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	one doesn't exist
2005-04-20T15:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	actually, the far more common one among Asian esl people is missing a plural
2005-04-20T15:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	english as a second language
2005-04-20T15:21:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	took me a moment to figure it out :)
2005-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	everyone knows that one, though
2005-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	but stable
2005-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	and tested
2005-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	I have my OS as a hobby, not my FS
2005-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	the probably with that, is then why are distros switching?
2005-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	bandwagons don't mean better ;)
2005-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	I think that if something was truly better, distros would have switched
2005-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	most of them use ext3 by default because it's been default for so long and they are afraid to change :-p
2005-04-20T15:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	The enterprise class ones yes, but the desktop distros?
2005-04-20T15:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	i0n_st0rm	it may have something to with ol' Hans attitude
2005-04-20T15:47:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	Burgundavia	many of the desktop distros are made by the same people
