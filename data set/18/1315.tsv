2011-03-28T22:40:00.000Z	tonyaldo		I have a canon powershot, and I'm having trouble viewing it as a mounted volume, meaning other than using shotwell I cant view it in the file manager, any suggestions?
2011-03-28T22:40:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	I have same camera
2011-03-28T22:41:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	are you able to browse it?
2011-03-28T22:41:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	I have same problem since updating Ubuntu, it USED TO work fine as a mounted volume, now I have to use F-Spot browser first, then it allows me to access camera as a drive
2011-03-28T22:43:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	damn lol
2011-03-28T22:43:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	can you access it as a drive when you use Shotwell?
2011-03-28T22:44:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	nope
2011-03-28T22:45:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	try F-Spot then that at least mounts it and makes it appear as a drive, its not so bad having to start F-Spot as it allows you to thumbnail view/transfer the pics anyway
2011-03-28T22:45:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	yea i'll do that now
2011-03-28T22:49:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	yea f-spot doesn't even detect it
2011-03-28T22:49:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	did you go into Choose folder..
2011-03-28T22:51:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	yea says choose folder and under that no camera detected
2011-03-28T22:51:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	yea =/ I unplugged it shut it off and plugged it back in
2011-03-28T22:52:00.000Z	perlmonkey1	tonyaldo	damn, what model cam do you have? let me try mine just to make sure I never missed anything
2011-03-28T22:52:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	SX30 IS
2011-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	o wait I got it :)
2011-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	tonyaldo	perlmonkey1	mounted perfectly
