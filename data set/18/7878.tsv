2008-05-21T23:32:00.000Z	gnuskool		its slower than my xp
2008-05-21T23:33:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 why are you trying to measure performance with intel integrated for? that's like trying to get a 0-60 time for a Yugo
2008-05-21T23:34:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	but my ubuntu is so slow, heck, its slower than my xp and i think its the x  configuration
2008-05-21T23:35:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 do a pastebin of the output from glxinfo
2008-05-21T23:41:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	1 minute, i was in xp, gonna boot ubuntu

2008-05-21T23:54:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	did you see the paste?
2008-05-21T23:57:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 looks like your 3d driver isn't loading
2008-05-21T23:58:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	any idea where i could bewgin to troubleshoot it?
2008-05-21T23:59:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 is it a GMA850 or GMA900?
2008-05-21T23:59:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	852/855
2008-05-22T00:00:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 try: sudo apt-get install 915resolution
2008-05-22T00:01:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	will i have to do anything else in xorg.conf?
2008-05-22T00:05:00.000Z	inxane	gnuskool	 i'm sorry, but i don't have much more info than that... check out http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2113867 and see if that helps at all... without compiling the driver and installing it manually, i wouldn't have any other idea
2008-05-22T00:06:00.000Z	gnuskool	inxane	thanks
