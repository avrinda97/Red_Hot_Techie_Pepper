2009-10-01T19:58:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: can you do this through the systems bios?
2009-10-01T20:00:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	i don't know,i have nvidia, so i want to use it
2009-10-01T20:01:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: OK, currently you have a onboard intel graphics card, but you wish to use your nvidia card? What is ubuntu defaulting to?
2009-10-01T20:03:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	its default with intel graphics card
2009-10-01T20:04:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	did u understand my problem? just want to remove intel and install nvidia card!!
2009-10-01T20:04:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	??
2009-10-01T20:05:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: So the Nvidia is currently running and your monitor is connected via it?
2009-10-01T20:05:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	i removed it, coz it will freeze ubuntu, in boot time only.........
2009-10-01T20:06:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: ah ok. I would put the nvidia card in and do a fail safe boot, then re-configure X
2009-10-01T20:06:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	u mean without disabling intel?
2009-10-01T20:07:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: Yes, normally once a AGP/PCI-E card is added the onboard card is disabled.
2009-10-01T20:07:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: All you need to do then is failsafe and reconfigure the X server with the new card.
2009-10-01T20:08:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	how to do failsafe boot and others?
2009-10-01T20:09:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: when the boot loader loads, you should see, "Press f8 (or another key) for options, this will then give you a option to load the fail safe mode
2009-10-01T20:10:00.000Z	abhilashm86	foey	oh ok, after installing nvidia drivers i need to do failsafe boot??
2009-10-01T20:11:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: Once in fail safe - type in :- sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-10-01T20:11:00.000Z	foey	abhilashm86	: Fail safe first > Reconfigure X > reboot > Then install nvidia drivers.
