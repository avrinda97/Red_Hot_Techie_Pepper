2011-12-18T16:55:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	so to the best of your knowledge, you are running  a stock ubuntu 11.10 without any custimaztions?
2011-12-18T16:58:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	ok, and how often does flicker did you say?
2011-12-18T16:58:00.000Z	rainbowwarrior	mazda01	:- it flickers for about 3 mins then stops again
2011-12-18T16:59:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	ok, first, do you know how to use pastebin?
2011-12-18T17:00:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	ok, first please post the results of lspci -v as well as modprobe -l

2011-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	and now please dmesg | grep NVIDIA
2011-12-18T17:10:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	Guest42322 I second CHEESE!!
2011-12-18T17:12:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	just issue dmeg | grep NVIDIA
2011-12-18T17:12:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	oops, dmesg | grep NVIDIA
2011-12-18T17:13:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	oh, then you'll need to issue this instead.  gunzip -c /var/log/dmesg.1.gz | grep NVIDIA
2011-12-18T17:14:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	or instead of dmesg.1.gz, use dmesg.0.gz
2011-12-18T17:16:00.000Z	rainbowwarrior	mazda01	i pasted the log to :- http://paste.ubuntu.com/774213/
2011-12-18T17:18:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	nope, I want a dmesg output that has NVIDIA in it otherwise you're not using the correct module for your installed graphics card
2011-12-18T17:20:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	anytime. my colledted knoweldge using ubuntu over 5 yeasr has made me be able to "pay it forward" to others who are joing the revolution. LOL
2011-12-18T17:21:00.000Z	mazda01	rainbowwarrior	i would say when you get the correct graphics module (which BTW is nvidia-current) you'll be golden and loving ubuntu again
