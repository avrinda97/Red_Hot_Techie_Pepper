2007-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	yadayada		what are some steps i could take to make ubuntu 100% secure for a webserver
2007-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	yadayada		?
2007-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	yadayada		alright fine.. 99.9% secure
2007-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	have a separate box for it, virtualize, host it somewhere else ...
2007-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	could you elaborate please?
2007-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	I suppose it all depends on what you mean secure is. What are you securing against?
2007-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	anything, making sure my database cannot be altered, deleted, etc
2007-11-16T06:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	then you need to make sure anything that can alter that database is locked down. Not just an apache problem, right?
2007-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	yadayada		jimcooncat; correct
2007-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	you using php? perl? something else to process the requests?
2007-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	yadayada		jimcooncat; php
2007-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	php and php only
2007-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	you write the php code or using someone else's?
2007-11-16T06:26:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	i have but i have spent so much time protecting it from sql injection and other hacks, that is why i want to make sure i take my time with this server so i dont find myself getting hacked
2007-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	so your server only does your webhosting, right?
2007-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	well idk, its the only server i have, so its gotta do it all, but that should be it, right?
2007-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	yadayada	jimcooncat	pm?
2007-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat	yadayada	sure, pm me
