2008-03-06T14:01:00.000Z	ArmedKing		Anyone got a clue about why my box is drawing 2d graphics so bad. I honestly dont know where to look anymore
2008-03-06T14:02:00.000Z	X-Seti	ArmedKing	try sudo apt-get install videolan
2008-03-06T14:03:00.000Z	X-Seti		there is some libs in that pack that fixed gfx issues for me
2008-03-06T14:03:00.000Z	X-Seti		it does if you install it
2008-03-06T14:03:00.000Z	X-Seti		yeah
2008-03-06T14:04:00.000Z	X-Seti		your need to install KDE first
2008-03-06T14:04:00.000Z	ArmedKing	X-Seti	i'm not talking about video play m8 hehe i allready got that one. But it has to do with the drawing of 2d apps in Gnome. all 3d work like a rabit. But scaling this window (xchat for example) eats away 60% CPU usage and is all sloppy
2008-03-06T14:05:00.000Z	X-Seti	ArmedKing	thats weird, X-Chat and other 2d apps are fine on here.
2008-03-06T14:06:00.000Z	ArmedKing	X-Seti	Every single window i open is a pain to move around and rescale
2008-03-06T14:06:00.000Z	X-Seti	ArmedKing	whats your screen res, mines 800x600 as i have an unknown moniter.
2008-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	ArmedKing	X-Seti	1680x1050, on an Nvidia Geforce 8600GTS (dual) sli connected
2008-03-06T14:07:00.000Z	X-Seti		I have dual 8800 SLI Ultras, no problems at all.
2008-03-06T14:08:00.000Z	X-Seti		i have 2 boxes with kubutu installed
2008-03-06T14:09:00.000Z	X-Seti	ArmedKing	id say reinstall it all with, or change something in the x-org settings.
2008-03-06T14:10:00.000Z	ArmedKing	X-Seti	i just done a fresh install havent changed a thing on this box ãƒ„
2008-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	X-Seti		Slap_Sti1k, its hard to tell running 3dmax max, or any other rendering program.
2008-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	X-Seti		Slap_Sti1k, It's a hell of alot faster then my old dev platform
2008-03-06T14:11:00.000Z	X-Seti	ArmedKing	I installed from a live cd.. ?
