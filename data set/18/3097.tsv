2009-12-22T14:20:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	cp -a foldername /usr/bin
2009-12-22T14:24:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	what exactly are you trying to do
2009-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	skitzo	indus	 i just want to put this program folder somewhere in the filesystem off the desktop :)
2009-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	ok but why in the filesystem
2009-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	you want to install it or just move the folder into /
2009-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	then just move it into /opt
2009-12-22T14:26:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	that folder is empty generally
2009-12-22T14:26:00.000Z	indus	skitzo	so sudo cp -a foldername /opt
