2007-01-18T09:39:00.000Z	saviles		i can't seem to get to this specific website (ruizbelvis.org). It works on my other computer which run winxp w/out any issues. I can ping it and it resolves to the correct IP. comparing traceroutes with my winxp system, they are identical, except that on my xubuntu system, it gets a 'no reply' after hop 16. trying telnet on port 80 doesn't work, nor does using wget work either. any suggestions?
