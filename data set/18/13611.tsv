2005-11-04T07:25:00.000Z	necator		i am working my awy thru the ubuntu starter guide and i made it ot the section nNetworking Utilities
2005-11-04T07:25:00.000Z	necator		theres a topic called how do i install a firewall? I am wondering if i actually need a firewall on ubuntu?
2005-11-04T07:26:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	it's your personal preference, if you're behing a router (which makes a pretty good firewall) I'd say it's over kill, otherwise you can never be too safe
2005-11-04T07:27:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	don't take this offensively, but the fact that you're asking, I tell you yes, install it
2005-11-04T07:29:00.000Z	necator	ubenguin	i am only asking becuase i am curious since i am new to linux i was told its soppose to be very secure but i always am interested in checking everything out so i wasnt sure if i really need the firewall or not.
2005-11-04T07:29:00.000Z	necator	ubenguin	but u are right and i will install it.
2005-11-04T07:30:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	I understand completely... I think you should install, yes linux is inherently more secure that most other os...
2005-11-04T07:30:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	but ...ya what Seveas said
2005-11-04T07:30:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	not to say you're stupid; we're just saying that really any os is only as secure as the admin
2005-11-04T07:31:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	google
2005-11-04T07:33:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	first time installing ubuntu?
2005-11-04T07:35:00.000Z	necator	ubenguin	first time on linux completely.
2005-11-04T07:35:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	ahh....well; welcome to a whole new world and you picked the right distro
2005-11-04T07:36:00.000Z	necator	ubenguin	i know i did quite a bit of research before hand :p and tryed about a month ago had some drastic results so turtled back into windows world for a month b4 i tryed it again the other night. this time using ubuntu when i found out a brand new version was being released (breezy)
2005-11-04T07:37:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	well, I've used mandrake, gentoo, red hat, fedora, memphis, xandros...just about all of them
2005-11-04T07:37:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	I can honestly say ubuntu blows all of them away
2005-11-04T07:38:00.000Z	ubenguin	necator	and one of the best things about ubuntu is the user guide and the community; I don't think any of the other distros can hold a candle to ubuntus user guide and community except for maybe gentoo
2005-11-04T07:43:00.000Z	necator	ubenguin	can i talk with you in #kubuntu-offtopic ?
