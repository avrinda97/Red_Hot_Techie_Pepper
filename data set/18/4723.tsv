2009-03-15T15:46:00.000Z	Ardorin		My xubuntu desktop keeps sending about 10kbps to the internet and I don't know why.
2009-03-15T15:48:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	make ping and paste
2009-03-15T15:48:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	ping anywhere? paste here?
2009-03-15T15:49:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	e.g. "sudo ping google.de" and yes, paste here
2009-03-15T15:50:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	yes, the line after
2009-03-15T15:51:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	What does that second line mean?
2009-03-15T15:55:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	are you sure with the 10kbps? where did you test it?
2009-03-15T15:56:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	I'm looking aht the graph the system monitor shows me.
2009-03-15T15:57:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	are you sure that you look right?
2009-03-15T15:58:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	yeah, why?
2009-03-15T15:58:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	because ping looks fine
2009-03-15T16:00:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	I'm not doing anything. My card is sending data at 13kpbs and my router is blinking a lot.
2009-03-15T16:02:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	you could find out which data is sending over the router, or you could eject the cable (power) from the router for a minute
2009-03-15T16:03:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	How do I do the first thing? how would the second thing help me?
2009-03-15T16:05:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	dont know, with a program which shows the network traffic, and the 2. could be not a problem of your pc, or? it could be a problem of the router
2009-03-15T16:05:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	no, when I turn this pc off and work with my laptop everything is fine.
2009-03-15T16:06:00.000Z	Incarus	Ardorin	and if you turn on the pc, other pcs got a slow internet connection?
2009-03-15T16:37:00.000Z	Ardorin	Incarus	no becuase it only uses 10kpbs, i have a pretty fast connection.
