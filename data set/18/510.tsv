2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	spim		However, it's giving me an error.
2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	spim		"The panel encoutnered a problem while loading "OAFIID:GNOME_FastUserSwitchApplet". Do you want to delete the applet from your configuration?"
2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	spim		Something I should be concerned about?
2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	spim		What is it?
2012-01-18T14:08:00.000Z	spim		Ah, ok.
2012-01-18T14:08:00.000Z	spim		Jesus, this is cool.
2012-01-18T14:08:00.000Z	spim		I think I'm falling in love with Linux.
2012-01-18T14:08:00.000Z	spim		A little at least.
2012-01-18T14:08:00.000Z	spim		Also, stupid question perhaps, but is it possible to give Linux/Ubuntu unorthodox screen resolutions?
2012-01-18T14:09:00.000Z	spim		That don't conform to 4:3 or 16:9.
2012-01-18T14:09:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	yes
2012-01-18T14:09:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	No
2012-01-18T14:23:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	if you want a lightweight distro, Ubuntu Server. For a GUI server, Xubuntu
2012-01-18T14:25:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	Xubuntu only needs 128 MB to run so you'll have plenty. Unity is laggy on my computer with 3 GB of memory, so I doubt you want it on 1/2 of a GB
2012-01-18T14:25:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	I was talkin about RAM btw
2012-01-18T14:26:00.000Z	spim	coolstar-ipod	Alright.
2012-01-18T14:27:00.000Z	coolstar-ipod	spim	that's why I dumped unity for KDE
2012-01-18T14:30:00.000Z	spim	coolstar-ipod	I'm not a big fan of trying solutions that sort of stray from popular/vanilla distros.
