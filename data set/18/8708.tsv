2009-11-13T23:57:00.000Z	annoia		Is there any easy way to add the lavcac3enc filter to mplayer in ubuntu?
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	coz_	annoia	 not sure  actually  but...you could join the  #mplayer channel to find out if there is an easy way if it is not already installed
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	annoia	coz_	- They told me to compile it on my own...
2009-11-13T23:58:00.000Z	coz_	annoia	 that makes sense.... compiling mplayer should not be that difficutlt  ...did they tell you how to include that ?
2009-11-13T23:59:00.000Z	annoia	coz_	- I just prefer to fix it through repositories, if possible...
2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	coz_	annoia	 I think...if that plugin or codec is not already in the pacakge  I dont think there are patches for this...it is most likely  you will have to compile the entire pacakge with the apparopariate tags for that plugin
2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	annoia	coz_	- Maybe I just need a different lavc...
2009-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	coz_	annoia	 I am not sure let me check  ...what is it again?

2009-11-14T00:02:00.000Z	annoia	coz_	- mplayer -af help gives you a list
2009-11-14T00:02:00.000Z	coz_	annoia	 mm  ok    I am sure there are audio converters for on the fly conversions  although I am not up on all of the them   let me checkj
