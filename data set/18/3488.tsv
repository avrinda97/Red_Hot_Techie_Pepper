2010-03-02T20:35:00.000Z	djoef		Hi, How can I access a local IP adres through extranet ? (or is this impossible) (Goal = print through vpn connetion, via browser)
2010-03-02T20:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	you need to portforward throught eh firewall
2010-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	you say you want to print there from the extranet that means either you need to enable the source's ip adress on the printer that you are trying to print to or if behind a firewall you need to portforward to the printer
2010-03-02T20:45:00.000Z	djoef	remoteCTRL1	that makes me think, I can ping to the printer.. so I could edit the printer to allow my adress to print directly on it ?
2010-03-02T20:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	basically thats the wway you do it
2010-03-02T20:47:00.000Z	djoef	remoteCTRL1	could I bypass the spooler this way ?
2010-03-02T20:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	why would you want that? and nope, only if you got a print server and bypass that one
2010-03-02T20:49:00.000Z	djoef	remoteCTRL1	because I do not get access to this printer through "unsafe" ubuntu
2010-03-02T20:49:00.000Z	djoef	remoteCTRL1	as in I am not allowed to use the local network
2010-03-02T20:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	whatya mean by unsafe?
2010-03-02T20:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	lowl
2010-03-02T20:50:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	in that case youre doomed id say
2010-03-02T20:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	yes?
2010-03-02T20:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	ah kk, np
2010-03-02T20:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	one more thing
2010-03-02T20:54:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	if your printers are browsable you can search for them in ubuntu and just use them, i seriously doubt that your it will notice that you printed from linux not windows
2010-03-02T20:56:00.000Z	djoef	remoteCTRL1	that is how I did it till now
2010-03-02T20:57:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	djoef	well you need to be able to connect to where the vpn terminates everything else is business as usual
