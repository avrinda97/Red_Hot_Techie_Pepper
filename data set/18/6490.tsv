2008-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	earthbound01		I'm installing Ubuntu (Hardy Heron) and it's reading my 80gb hdd as  a 40 gb hdd.  Please Help.
2008-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	earthbound01		I'm sorry, I don't know what dd is.  I'm something of a newb.

2008-09-11T05:33:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	do you have anything installed in the hard drive?
2008-09-11T05:35:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	are you sure you are looking at the entire drive and not just the partition
2008-09-11T05:42:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	type "sudo fdisk -l" and use pastebin to give me the output
2008-09-11T05:43:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	that is how much free space is on that disk.. and since you have both windows and ubuntu installed on it.. you'll definately not have an empty drive..
2008-09-11T05:44:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	use pastebin
2008-09-11T05:47:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	its "sudo fdisk -l"  <-- add the -l (lowercase L)
2008-09-11T05:51:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	is ubuntu the only OS installed?
2008-09-11T05:52:00.000Z	earthbound01	djhash	it should be.  A long time ago this disk had XP on it.
2008-09-11T05:53:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	are you sure it is an 80GB HDD? does the bios see it as 80GB?
2008-09-11T05:54:00.000Z	earthbound01	djhash	This might be a bios problem, you're right.  It says 80gb on the case, and when it had XP it had 80gb too.
2008-09-11T05:54:00.000Z	earthbound01	djhash	it says 80gb (or the equivalent in bytes) directly on the drive.
2008-09-11T05:55:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	maybe you have lost sectors and filesystems..
2008-09-11T05:55:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	or hidden for that matter..
2008-09-11T05:56:00.000Z	earthbound01	djhash	Hidden is unlikely, I'm the original owner of this drive.
2008-09-11T06:00:00.000Z	djhash	earthbound01	you can use a utility called "testdisk" to make sure everything is ok.. but it is a very powerful program and used improperly can basically damage your filesystem beyond recovery.. you could ask for help here for someone who knows how to use it.. or read up on it.
