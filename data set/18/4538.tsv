2009-09-12T21:37:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	id -Gn username
2009-09-12T21:37:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	thanks
2009-09-12T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	Different how? 600 vs 644?
2009-09-12T22:15:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	yes
2009-09-12T22:15:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	This depends on the umask you use, and the umask ftpd is using.
2009-09-12T22:16:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	oh ok see it now in vsftp.conf
2009-09-12T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	Usually, the default umask is 022, so when creating a file, the permissions are calculated like this: 0666 & ~022 = 0644
2009-09-12T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	Similarly, umask 077 results in 0600 for files and 0700 for directories.
2009-09-12T22:17:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	All the numbers are in octal, by the way.
2009-09-12T22:18:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	The default umask for normal logins is set in /etc/login.defs (but it's often overriden by /etc/profile or even ~/.profile)
2009-09-12T22:19:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	thank you. so 0750 is 027?
2009-09-12T22:19:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	Yep.
2009-09-12T22:19:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	thanks
2009-09-12T22:20:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	You could open Python, for example, and use oct( 0777 & ~027 ) to calculate it.
2009-09-12T22:20:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	And remember that files will never be executable by default.
2009-09-12T22:21:00.000Z	Vegancheesesteak	grawity	is that a problem with apache?
2009-09-12T22:22:00.000Z	grawity	Vegancheesesteak	No, it shouldn't be. As long as Apache is permitted to read a file, it'll work fine.
