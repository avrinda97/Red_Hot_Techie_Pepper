2012-11-11T03:13:00.000Z	spendythrift		any ideas why i can ssh with public key authentication but scp fails?
2012-11-11T03:14:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	in what way does it fail? what are the errors?
2012-11-11T03:15:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	the authentication fails and it rolls back to key-board interactive but user password doesn't work
2012-11-11T03:16:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	did you already disable keyboard-interactive?
2012-11-11T03:17:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	i did not
2012-11-11T03:18:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	hmm, are you certain that you try to acces the same host in both cases?
2012-11-11T03:19:00.000Z	guntbert		!list | portatile
2012-11-11T03:19:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	i think my syntax is correct
2012-11-11T03:20:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	I was not talking about syntax - one common error is a wrong IP address
2012-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	guntbert		!enter | ubuntu-fan001
2012-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	ah, yes I am certain the IP address's are correct.  I'm trying to run the command locally instead of over ssh now to see if that fixes it
2012-11-11T03:23:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	and start scp with -v
2012-11-11T03:25:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	it looks like roaming not allowed by server is where my problems start
2012-11-11T03:27:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	what has ssh/scp to do with roaming?
2012-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	idk, but it says roaming not allowed by server then a ssh2_msg_service_request and accept happens and it rolls back to keyboard-interactive authentication
2012-11-11T03:30:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	in that case I suggest you have a look into the server logs - thats the first time I hear of that
2012-11-11T03:31:00.000Z	spendythrift	guntbert	i'll take a look...thanks for your help!
2012-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	guntbert	spendythrift	nothing accomplished so far :-))  Good luck!
