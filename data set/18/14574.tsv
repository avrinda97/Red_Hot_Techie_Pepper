2006-04-15T05:34:00.000Z	pao		is there a default file browser on ubuntu ?
2006-04-15T05:35:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	nautilus
2006-04-15T05:36:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	where is it ? how do I launch it ?
2006-04-15T05:37:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	from the places menu you can start it (if you are using gnome)
2006-04-15T05:38:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	I am using gnome but I have not got "nautilus"
2006-04-15T05:39:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	install it then, but it's strange you don't have it installed since it is installed per default
2006-04-15T05:39:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	I think I have it, but it has not got the fancy toolbar and predefined place such as Desktop etc...
2006-04-15T05:45:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	look at this screenshot, that is far from looking like Nautilus http://www.edubuntu.org/images/tour/gnome-nautilus.png
2006-04-15T05:46:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	?
2006-04-15T05:46:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	well if you can view stuff and icons and zoom-in, zoom-out I think that's nautilus.
2006-04-15T05:46:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	why do you think that screenshot isn't nautilus?
2006-04-15T05:47:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	that IS, mine has not got the same tool bar, no back reload or shortcuts, no left colum etc...
2006-04-15T05:48:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	although, when I lauch nautilus from the comman line, it opens the same window that I got from Place, so mine IS also nautilus; it just does not look as good, why ?
2006-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	is there stuff to add to Nautilus to make it have a left columns and a tool bar with back buttons and everything ?
2006-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	oh I was just about to ask you if you've tried from the command line.
2006-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	pao	Jhair	yep same, strange no ?
2006-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	there are other nautilus packages, e.g. nautilus-data
2006-04-15T05:50:00.000Z	Jhair	pao	could you check this list? http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=nautilus&searchon=names&subword=1&version=breezy&release=all
