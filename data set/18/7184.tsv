2009-01-06T15:32:00.000Z	adac		Why does sensors-detect only discover the cpu core sensors? Can someone help me with that?
2009-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	rww	adac	have you run "sudo sensors-detect"?
2009-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	rww	adac	... sorry, misread.
2009-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	adac	rww	yeah
2009-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	rww	adac	Hrm. What type of motherboard do you have?
2009-01-06T15:33:00.000Z	rww	adac	(I thought you said lm-sensors, not sensors-detect, hence the stupid reply >.> )
2009-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	adac	rww	No problem! Its a dell xps 420 desktop. I don't know the name of the motherboard
2009-01-06T15:38:00.000Z	adac	rww	I guess it is an intel board, but I'm not sure
2009-01-06T15:39:00.000Z	rww	adac	Hmm. I can't find the motherboard information for that model, so I can't see if there's a workaround. But the basic answer is that either your motherboard doesn't have sensors, or those sensors aren't supported by lm-sensors :(
2009-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	adac	rww	ok I see... Probably it is really not supported :(
2009-01-21T14:16:00.000Z	rww	adac	There might be; I don't use Ubuntu Server ;)
2009-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	rww	adac	are you using wired ethernet or wifi?
2009-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	adac	rww	ethernet. Slart: where are they located?
2009-01-21T14:07:00.000Z	rww	adac	then read "man interfaces" and edit /etc/network/interfaces appropriately
2009-01-21T14:09:00.000Z	rww	adac	You'll probably end up adding two lines: "auto eth0" and "iface eth0 inet dhcp", but it's probably a good idea to read that man page anyway.
2009-01-21T14:15:00.000Z	adac	rww	I think there is a command which writes those two lines: auto eth0 AND iface eth0 inet dhcp automatically in the /etc/network/interfaces file. But I added them by hand and it works now. thx rww and Slart
2009-01-21T14:17:00.000Z	adac	rww	well there is not much a difference to normal ubuntu I would say. Only on installation...because my grafic card is half broken I could'nt see the option to set for the automatic dhclient activation, so i skipped that point on installation and now I had to set it by myself ;)
2010-10-13T03:01:00.000Z	rww	adac	To be annoying. Best to ignore them.
