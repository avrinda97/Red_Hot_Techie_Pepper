2004-09-05T07:52:00.000Z	rburton		aes: your blog entry was a little confusing
2004-09-05T07:53:00.000Z	rburton		i'd say 90% of packages are in universe, so no extra repositories would be needed
2004-09-05T07:53:00.000Z	rburton		no need for pinning etc
2004-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	rburton		probably, yes
2004-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	rburton		:)
2004-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	rburton		add "deb http://ftp.no-name-yet.com/no-name-yet/ warty universe"
2004-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	rburton		np
2004-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	rburton		i only discovered it when i moaned about the lack of xemacs :)
2004-09-05T07:55:00.000Z	rburton		xemacs being broken?
2004-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	rburton		i'm sure it is
2004-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	lamont	rburton	xemacs21 should be there soon
2004-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	rburton	lamont	its all in apart from xemacs21-basesupport
2004-09-05T08:06:00.000Z	lamont	rburton	we can't build xemacs21-packages (source for xemacs21-basesupport) because xemacs21-basesupport isn't built.  sigh.
2004-09-05T08:24:00.000Z	lamont	rburton	it was more the people that were scary - the actual models aren't so scary
2004-09-25T06:36:00.000Z	lamont	rburton	bug #1066
2004-09-25T06:37:00.000Z	lamont	rburton	cdrecord, or groisofs?
2004-09-25T06:39:00.000Z	rburton	lamont	probably growisofs as i was writing to a dvd-rw
2004-09-25T07:24:00.000Z	rburton	lamont	lets blame railtrack
