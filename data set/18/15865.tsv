2005-02-19T14:20:00.000Z	HaloGray		it wasn't this way in warty
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	HaloGray		I wouldn't really call myself a wizard... but I'm running it on my laptop
2005-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	HaloGray		what's up?
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	HaloGray		docking stations tend to have different hardware than the free laptop
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	HaloGray		You'll have to probe for any new hardware I suppose
2005-02-19T12:03:00.000Z	HaloGray		Thinkpads are grand BTW
2005-02-19T12:04:00.000Z	HaloGray		Same story for me and my T20
2005-02-19T12:04:00.000Z	HaloGray		I finally decided it was time for an upgrade... and got a Dell :(
2005-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	HaloGray		They had a sale for $750 off and it was too good to pass up
2005-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	HaloGray		it can when you're on a college budget :)
2005-02-19T12:06:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	what's the problem with your Dell?
2005-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	I'm still leaning away from IBM since they sold
2005-02-21T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	sort of.  It's not smart enough to detect the active NIC
2005-02-21T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	it just uses the last one it was configured to
2005-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	HaloGray	tritium	that's the monitor itself though... I'm just happy that my wireless drivers work ok now and tell it what the wireless signal is and all that
2005-02-21T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	that's good :)
2005-02-21T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	you shouldn't be experience much multipath fading from 10 feet away ;)  It's probably something in Windows.
2005-02-22T09:56:00.000Z	tritium	HaloGray	firestarter, maybe
