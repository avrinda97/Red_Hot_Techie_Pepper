2012-04-29T20:54:00.000Z	upset		Why doesn't Ubuntu want to rely on mono? What's so bad about it?
2012-04-29T20:55:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	it was mostly unnecessary and took a relevant part of the default CD size.
2012-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	Really? I mean, I keep finding packages that depend on it.
2012-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	then whenever you install those packages, you'll install Mono.
2012-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	Tasque and Pinta depend on it.
2012-04-29T20:56:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	I know.
2012-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	Daekdroom		Once Banshee was replaced by Rhythmbox, only Tetravex (I think that's the name), which is a game, depended on it. They needed more space on the CD so they removed both from the default install, upset.
2012-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	I'm just wondering if I'm necessarily installing some insidious bloatwhere.
2012-04-29T20:57:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	there's some strong criticism towards Mono.
2012-04-29T20:58:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	Yes, but what is it? Where can I find it?
2012-04-29T20:58:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	I'd like to understand the issue more fully
2012-04-29T20:58:00.000Z	upset		Bye!
2012-04-29T21:01:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	it's not yet working with GTK+3. It's based on Microsoft .NET. Some developers claim it's resource-heavy and bloated.
2012-04-29T21:04:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	Only some claim it's heavy? What, like they can't do benchmarks?
2012-04-29T21:05:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	I don't see how benchmarking would help
2012-04-29T21:06:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	To show what effect mono-based programs have on resource usage?
2012-04-29T21:06:00.000Z	Daekdroom	upset	nobody is gonna write something in two different languages to compare the implementation. It's mostly a matter of opinion.
2012-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	upset	Daekdroom	I just don't understand how a performance issue could be immeasurable.
