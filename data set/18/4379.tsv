2011-02-10T08:44:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	grub is the bootloader. you'll need a livecd to try to repair that.
2011-02-10T08:45:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	if you've dual booted you can use the windows cd to repair the mbr
2011-02-10T08:48:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	machine froze on you? thats what firefox does to me
2011-02-10T08:49:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	yeah that happens to me too. I believe its caused by the flash plugin.
2011-02-10T08:51:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	you dual boot with your bios? what a pain!
2011-02-10T08:51:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	so what exactly happened? You were performing an upgrade and firefox (flash) froze your machine?
2011-02-10T08:53:00.000Z	^Phantom2^	jack_	yes
2011-02-10T08:54:00.000Z	jack_	^Phantom2^	what does rebooting do? you get to the grub screen but no further? what do you see on the screen?
