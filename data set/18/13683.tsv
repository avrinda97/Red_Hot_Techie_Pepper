2007-07-30T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I think I'll order the disks.
2007-07-30T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		...
2007-07-30T10:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		have them shipped to me.
2007-07-30T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I don't trust VMWare.
2007-07-30T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_Link		So I shut down my computer, put Ubuntu in the drive, and then start it up with the CD loaded in?
2007-07-30T10:44:00.000Z	Dr_Link		Can you install Ubuntu while you're inside Windows?
2007-07-30T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Link		.
2007-07-30T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I'm serious... I'd like to install it WITH Windows still on my hard drive.
2007-07-30T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Link		:D
2007-07-30T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Link		My parents paid me good money to get this laptop.
2007-07-30T10:47:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	There are Linux distros which can work with an image inside a Fat32 partition.
2007-07-30T10:47:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	But normally, we re-partition.
2007-07-30T10:47:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	OOPS
2007-07-30T10:47:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	NTFS support is much better these days, but has been very hairy.
2007-07-30T10:48:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	If you have a spare hard drive, you can make an exact copy of your windows hard drive before trying to re-partition.
2007-07-30T10:49:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	I am not sure if I am getting in half way through the conversation, but the Ubuntu live CD installer can shrink your windows partition to make space for a native Linux partition. Recommend backup data first.
2007-07-30T10:50:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	Once windows partition shrank, and Ubuntu installed, you can dual boot.
2007-07-30T10:50:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	Dr_Link	Boot selector comes up first. Select Ubuntu or windows.
