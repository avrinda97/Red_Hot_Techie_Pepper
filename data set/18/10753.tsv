2007-07-28T06:45:00.000Z	cornell		Thanks trwww, but nope
2007-07-28T06:47:00.000Z	cornell		1-6 nada
2007-07-28T06:47:00.000Z	cornell		When it's booting. there's a message about starting.  Later a splash of...staticy color, then nada
2007-07-28T06:48:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	boot single
2007-07-28T06:50:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	I don't suppose F8 would work?
2007-07-28T06:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	not usually, but you have the ability to get it to (if your box works normally)
2007-08-04T05:45:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	hwinfo --monitor will tell you h&v rates, but you can just omit them, or chose medium when the reconfigure asks you
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	lspci | grep
2007-08-04T05:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	lspci | grep VGA will tell you
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	but the monitor != the vid card
2007-08-04T05:52:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	I kinda figured...
2007-08-04T05:53:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	apt-get install hwinfo && hwinfo --monitor for the h&v rates ... when xorg is not running.
2007-08-04T05:54:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	"apt-get install hwinfo && hwinfo --monitor" is the command?
2007-08-04T05:56:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	that would like be atm eh?
2007-08-04T07:09:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	I'm looking at xorg.conf, I see subsection "display" depth, modes etc. But I don't see how I can specify a resolution.
2007-08-04T07:12:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	or maybe I could change the font?  How to do that, or the resolution?
2007-08-04T08:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell	fonts are a mystery to me .. you might try installing some more though. and check out ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/100.14.11/README/index.html for tweaks to xorg.conf
2007-08-04T09:00:00.000Z	cornell	jetscreamer	did you see the pm?
