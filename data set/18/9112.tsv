2007-07-18T08:27:00.000Z	leperkhanz		which flag?
2007-07-18T08:28:00.000Z	leperkhanz		why would I be unable to mount it in gparted?
2007-07-18T08:30:00.000Z	leperkhanz		should I try to mount the partition in the terminal?  If so what is the command?
2007-07-18T08:30:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	what you trying to do?
2007-07-18T08:31:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	what you trying to do? with gparted?
2007-07-18T08:32:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	which partition is it you're referring to?
2007-07-18T08:32:00.000Z	leperkhanz	bulmer	any idea why it would have disappeared, /dev/sdb2
2007-07-18T08:32:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	is that a usb drive or usb device?
2007-07-18T08:33:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	cat /etc/fstab and see if that sata drive has an entry
2007-07-18T08:34:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	you need to prefix a nick to your response or else it will be missed
2007-07-18T08:35:00.000Z	leperkhanz	bulmer	OK.  Is it a problem with ntfs-3g?
2007-07-18T08:35:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	sudo mount -a
2007-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	leperkhanz	bulmer	cables: No, I'm just missing this one drive for some reason.
2007-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	leperkhanz	bulmer	cables, just tried sudu mount -a.  Status unchanged.  Failed to mount several in use disks.
2007-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	bulmer	leperkhanz	reboot and see if it recovers
2007-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	leperkhanz	bulmer	tried that.
