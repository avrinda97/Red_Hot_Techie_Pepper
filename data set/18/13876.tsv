2005-10-04T06:53:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Tooheys	I suppose Mono is partial implementation of .NET on linux
2005-10-04T06:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Tooheys	It is not about MS technology. It makes you easy to write program in your choice of language and then run it on any platform where Mono is available.

2005-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Tooheys	Why don't you get some linux certification. That will get you a job and then you will be able to work for opensource.
