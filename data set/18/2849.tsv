2010-06-28T04:16:00.000Z	Gryllida	erUSUL	this is supposed to run next commands as root on some systems

2010-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	you should fix your "a" key :)
2010-07-22T02:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	how are you running it ? maybe it is a problem with the make file ?
2010-07-22T02:59:00.000Z	Gryllida	erUSUL	I'm installing python 2.7. I'm running ./configure and then make
2010-07-22T03:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	is a 32 bit machine ?
2010-07-22T03:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	do not think limiting the memory would help; make will fail anyway
2010-07-22T03:04:00.000Z	Gryllida	erUSUL	I dunno, as for now it just fails because the OS knocks if off b/c it's too ram hungry, if I limited it, it would possibly succeed
2010-07-22T03:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	try ulimit then before launching it; but what i suspect is when the system dennies make the memory it needs it will die anyway
2010-07-22T03:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gryllida	i think that something is wrong with the makefile; maybe you can ask in a python channel or in #workingset ( for make troubles )
