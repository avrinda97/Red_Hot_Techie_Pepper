2005-11-20T06:56:00.000Z	StDellis		I'm looking for a program for linux that works like Maple for windows? Can someone help me please!
2005-11-20T06:56:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	maple
2005-11-20T06:56:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	emacs calc is useful for symbolic stuff, too
2005-11-20T06:58:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	the mapl company sells it
2005-11-20T08:14:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	that's unlikely to be neccessary
2005-11-20T08:14:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	you really checked and found ubuntu didn't have it?
2005-11-20T08:15:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	in the add printer dialog?
2005-11-20T08:15:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	my printer is in there labeled Dell Photo Printer 720 but I dont have the driver for it
2005-11-20T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	what do you mean by "I don't have the driver for it"
2005-11-20T08:16:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	I've been referred to this site http://www.staerk.de/thorsten/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=43 to install but cant seem to get it to work
2005-11-20T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	ignore that
2005-11-20T08:16:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	like it says install driver then it comes up with a dialog box to search for it but I have no idea where or what I'm looking for
2005-11-20T08:18:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	what do you suggest I do then?
2005-11-20T08:18:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	what sort of printer is it really?
2005-11-20T08:19:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	Its a Dell Photo Printer 720 but I guess its really a Lexmark
2005-11-20T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	bah, do not use rpm
2005-11-20T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	StDellis	use alien to convert it to a .deb
2005-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	StDellis	bob2	I'm really really new to linux so that doesnt help me at all lol
