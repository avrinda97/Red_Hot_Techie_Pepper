2011-02-19T22:45:00.000Z	jsw_		ikon:I read ;)  Any pointers to issues with boot loader not .. finding any kernels .. when installing 10.10 onto 3ware RAID card?
2011-02-19T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	sorry what ?
2011-02-19T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	ok, so lets step back a little, what mode do you have the 3ware in
2011-02-19T22:47:00.000Z	jsw_	ikonia	so if you have a pointer to a troubleshooting guide I'll gladly RTFM :)
2011-02-19T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	easy on the language please.
2011-02-19T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	are you using the card as a jbod or in a hardware raid configuration
2011-02-19T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	ok, so where is the problem/error message ?
2011-02-19T22:50:00.000Z	jsw_	ikonia	doing a fresh 10.10 install, everything seems to go smoothly, except when I reboot it hangs at "grub is loading   please wait ...." or similar message.  This is right after the line indicating it ran GRUB 1.5.
2011-02-19T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	ok, do you have any other disks in your system other than the ones connected to the 3ware
2011-02-19T22:52:00.000Z	jsw_	ikonia	yes, I also have an SSD that the installer sees as /dev/sdc, and a DVD-R drive I'm using to install
2011-02-19T22:53:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	which device is the actual boot device ?
2011-02-19T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	what about the motherboards bios, what does it say is the boot device
2011-02-19T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	do a test, try to boot of the SSD, do you get the grub error then /
2011-02-19T22:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	not yet, run the test, lets work this out
2011-02-19T22:56:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	its looking for the state files to start the boot
2011-02-19T22:56:00.000Z	jsw_	ikonia	so if in fact it is booting the "old grub," those files are no longer there since I formatted /dev/sda1 (/boot) right?
2011-02-19T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	that's why it's not working then
2011-02-19T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	jsw_	check out the two links ubottu just sent you
