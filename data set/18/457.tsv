2012-02-10T13:21:00.000Z	meow_		hello everyone, i just installed KDE4 on my xubuntu oniric, the anti-aliasing on the fonts has disappeared which has made the text almost unreadble :( i tried doing a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but that exited without doing anything :(
2012-02-10T13:21:00.000Z	meow_		please help
2012-02-10T13:22:00.000Z	meow_		anyone :(
2012-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	meow_		i dont want to reinstall the whole thing again
2012-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	meow_		KDE
2012-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	meow_		tried setting it from the kde's settings manager, nothing happened
2012-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	meow_		the text looks pathetically ugly right now
2012-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	did you relogin after that?
2012-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	antialiasing on KDE or on XFCE?
2012-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	you can control its antialiasing settings on systemsettings -> application appearance -> fonts
2012-02-10T13:24:00.000Z	meow_	Tm_T	i tried doing that
2012-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	that doesn't matter
2012-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	meow_	Tm_T	oh
2012-02-10T13:27:00.000Z	meow_	Tm_T	well, seems like i cant even do a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg anymore
2012-02-10T13:27:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	how you cannot do it?
2012-02-10T13:28:00.000Z	meow_	Tm_T	i type in the command, and it exists without doing anything
2012-02-10T13:28:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	ah, it does, silently (:
2012-02-10T13:28:00.000Z	Tm_T	meow_	see your ~/.fonts.conf
