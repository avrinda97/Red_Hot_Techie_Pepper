2006-07-14T13:16:00.000Z	XGas		Errrr...... Help?
2006-07-14T13:16:00.000Z	XGas		heh
2006-07-14T13:16:00.000Z	XGas		I'm running Ubuntu on VMWare Workstation
2006-07-14T13:17:00.000Z	XGas		And I'm trying to install the VMware package
2006-07-14T13:17:00.000Z	XGas		Then Where can I get the C complier?
2006-07-14T13:18:00.000Z	XGas		yep
2006-07-14T13:18:00.000Z	XGas		tried
2006-07-14T13:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	"sudo apt-get install build-essential" will install gcc, as well as many other things
2006-07-14T13:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	what platform are you on?
2006-07-14T13:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	"sudo apt-get install build-essential" will install gcc, as well as many other things, as many have told you to do, in that case
2006-07-14T13:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	/usr/bin
2006-07-14T13:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	/usr/bin is NOT "property of the user, only /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin is "owned" by the package manager
2006-07-14T13:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	ls /usr/local/, you'll find /usr/local/bin/ under there, but all the directories there are fair game for you
2006-07-14T13:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	are you a coder?  you'll find that useful if so, incidental if not
2006-07-14T13:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	yes /usr/local/bin/whatever
2006-07-14T13:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	sudo apt-get --reinstall install foo bar, for packages foo and bar, if that's what you want
2006-07-14T13:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	but iif you actually hosed /usr/bin/ i would instead suggest a reinstall of ubuntu from scratch
2006-07-14T13:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	XGas	mkdir
