2010-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	Hi.  You can create a virtual machine to run any OS you want.
2010-08-23T06:11:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	you're saying you can use e.g. VirtuaBox ?
2010-08-23T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	yes.
2010-08-23T06:11:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	But it is illegal.  And this technically isn't the channel to do it.
2011-05-29T23:59:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	do you have a BCM43XX card?
2011-05-30T00:10:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	You have two problems.  One is your wifi card the other is your not being able to boot / log in / whatever.  I sincerely doubt that the wifi card is causing the second issue.  Fix the second issue first.  Can you describe it again to me please?
2011-05-30T00:10:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	i dont have a problem booting the live usb
2011-05-30T00:10:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	it just crashes while trying to install ubuntu
2011-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	You haven't installed yet?  Are those errors from the live USB?
2011-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	exactly
2011-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	You can install the driver to the live USB
2011-05-30T00:12:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	it sounds like i'll have to.  i'll try to check out that link from the picture i took
2011-05-30T00:12:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	Ubuntu live images crash if there is bad hardware or a bad image on the USB/CD.  Try re-creating the USB key
2011-05-30T00:12:00.000Z	BKTech86	edbian	well its telling me the wifi card is the problem so i'm going to try that first
2011-05-30T00:13:00.000Z	edbian	BKTech86	The wifi card will not work.  I'm very familiar with those errors.  That is not the reason it is not booting
