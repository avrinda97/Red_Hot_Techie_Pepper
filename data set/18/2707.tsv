2010-03-13T10:01:00.000Z	BigMoose		i cant connect to the internet on my ubuntu box, can someone please help me
2010-03-13T10:02:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	using wireless or wired?
2010-03-13T10:03:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	a wired connection
2010-03-13T10:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	I noticed, and you can't get IP addresses, etc?
2010-03-13T10:04:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	my /etc/network/interfaces file only has one entry, the one for the loopback
2010-03-13T10:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	sounds like your wired chipset doesn't have a driver
2010-03-13T10:06:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	does have auto lo sorry, then the loopback.  am I simply out of luck or is there anywhere I can search for a driver?
2010-03-13T10:07:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	you'd have to search for the driver most likely, which ubuntu are you using anyway?
2010-03-13T10:08:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	I'm using 9.10
2010-03-13T10:09:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	weird, do you have any other ways to access the internet on that same machine that is having issues
2010-03-13T10:11:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	have a wireless card however that's not working either, a dlink dwa 552.
2010-03-13T10:13:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	funny its supposed to work, that wireless card
2010-03-13T10:15:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	i click the connection menu i have access to "Connect to Hidden Wireless Network"  however there's no entry in interfaces, should I manually add something to it?
2010-03-13T10:16:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	check to see if ath9k is loaded under lspci -nnk
2010-03-13T10:18:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	it's not loaded
2010-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	I do see my ethernet controller in there
2010-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	BigMoose	hmm the wireless card needs to be plugged in, maybe you need to manually modprobe the driver for wireless
2010-03-13T10:21:00.000Z	BigMoose	psycho_oreos	thanks for all your help, i'm going to look into this some more tomorrow.
