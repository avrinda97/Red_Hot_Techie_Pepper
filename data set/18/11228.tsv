2007-05-04T14:16:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	 (1)close the audio appliaction (2) open a terminal and try "sudo chmod 666 /dev/dsp" or "sudo chmod 666 /dev/audio" or "sudo chmod 666 /dev/mixer" depending on the application you are trying to hear audio through (3) open your audio application and see if it works
2007-05-04T14:20:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	ok.  idid it take the other two?
2007-05-04T14:21:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	they don't exist either?
2007-05-04T14:22:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	you have me stumped.  prehaps reinstall alsa
2007-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	I can't say.  you've got a custom kernel and a custom alsa so I cannot tell what you might have done.  my sounds works, though I once got a "cannot find /dev/dsp" for one of the movie players and did a "mkdir /dev/dsp" and the chmod I already posted. it worked.  with yours, I don't know
2007-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	does the sound work from a LiveCD?
2007-05-04T14:27:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	yeah me too 00:02.7 Multimedia audio controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  AC'97 Sound Controller (rev a0)
2007-05-04T14:29:00.000Z	StoneNote	nosbourg	put your dvd in your computer and then check it. it's on the menu that pops up.  you'll be able to see if your burnt copy is bad
