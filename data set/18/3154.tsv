2009-12-14T00:39:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	when i access cfdisk for this partition i get the error message "  FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition 0: Partition begins after end-of-disk
2009-12-14T00:40:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	Ive had that error recently. Give me a sec to remember how I solved it
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	Does the partition mount?
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	yes
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	me and itilious  are the same person, i'm just switching back and forth between computers in different rooms ;)
2009-12-14T00:41:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	Can you right click it on the desktop and then click format?
2009-12-14T00:42:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	I thought your name changed!
2009-12-14T00:43:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	my mistake i can't actually mount it
2009-12-14T00:44:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	did you use sudo before that command?
2009-12-14T00:44:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	yes
2009-12-14T00:48:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	DO you have a second OS you can use? I think I ended up formatting the partition on windows
2009-12-14T00:49:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	no thats the source of the whole issue because i'm trying to get a second os installed :/
2009-12-14T00:52:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	I solved mine, as it was an external drive, by doing write partition table in gparted but that will destroy all data on your drive. You need to repair the partition table somehow
2009-12-14T00:53:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	i dont know how but i got gparted to mount it finally
2009-12-14T00:53:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	Thats what mine was like. After a few reboot it decided to behave
2009-12-14T00:54:00.000Z	Jay__	gadget3000	now cfdisk simply says "can't open disk drive" even though i've mounted it
2009-12-14T00:59:00.000Z	gadget3000	Jay__	did you get that last message from whitor?? ask him how to use fdisk to repair partition table
