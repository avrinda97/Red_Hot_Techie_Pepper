2005-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	kent	toran	what looks professional?
2005-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	toran	kent	drupal
2005-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	kent	toran	I like wordpress better. It was easy to install and works great :)
2005-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	toran	kent	yeah, but wordpress seems to be mainly for blogs :)
2005-06-02T06:01:00.000Z	kent	toran	well, Its possibel to write normal pages aswell. I made it to have a statical page as frontpage and only use the blog-thing for diary/blog.  (http://leviatan.kicks-ass.org - in swedish though..)
2005-06-02T06:01:00.000Z	toran	kent	yes, I've seen it used in that way. We need something that can be used in a professional environment
2005-06-02T06:02:00.000Z	kent	toran	ok. I use it only for fun, so I cant speak when it comes to professional stuff i guess.
2005-06-02T06:03:00.000Z	toran	kent	actually, it is an EXCELLENT product for personal use
2005-06-02T06:05:00.000Z	kent	toran	drupal or wordpress? ;) *tired and confused* :)
