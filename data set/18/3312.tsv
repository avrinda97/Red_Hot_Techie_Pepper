2009-11-21T00:22:00.000Z	hedkandi		hello
2009-11-21T00:22:00.000Z	hedkandi		golly I'm so unhappy can anyone help me?
2009-11-21T00:23:00.000Z	hedkandi		if I enter sudo chown bob file it refuses because I have no user called bob!
2009-11-21T00:23:00.000Z	hedkandi		how do I over-ride this idiot behaviour?
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	hedkandi	 a file has to be owned by a user or group
2009-11-21T00:25:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	he doesn't.
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	not yet anyway
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	so what if he's not listed in the users database?
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	I'm not an idiot nube who can't tell the difference between a user and a box of sardines
2009-11-21T00:26:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	hedkandi	 you have to create the user record first to assign ownership
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	my point is that if I am root, then I can assign ownership as I please
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi		My system is not going to break just because I have a file assigned to a non-existant user
2009-11-21T00:27:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	as I said, I'm not an idiot nube I know the logic
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	The more powerful logic is to ask whether it is feasible for the system to try to maintain
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	hedkandi	 you are spending more time telling everyone you are not a noob, than reading those that are trying to help ou
2009-11-21T00:28:00.000Z	hedkandi	IdleOne	an existant user for every file
2009-11-21T00:29:00.000Z	hedkandi		okay then many thanks for your help.
2009-11-21T00:29:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	hedkandi	 in unix everything is a file, and everything needs an owner.  you can't have a file without an owner, and therefore you can't have a resource in unix without an owner.
