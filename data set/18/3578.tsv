2009-12-21T21:18:00.000Z	Karger78		it said bad image when it tried to boot
2009-12-21T21:18:00.000Z	Karger78		Dr Willis, I just used the standard dd command
2009-12-21T21:19:00.000Z	Karger78		just dd if & of
2009-12-21T21:19:00.000Z	Karger78		no paramaters
2009-12-21T21:19:00.000Z	Karger78		Dr_willis i just used the standard dd command, no paramatres.  Just the dd if and of
2009-12-21T21:21:00.000Z	Karger78		Usurper, i did that, took about an hour to mount.
2009-12-21T21:21:00.000Z	Karger78		maybe i will try again
2009-12-21T21:23:00.000Z	Karger78		<_UsUrPeR_> took about 1 hour to mount a 4 gig image on a 16 gig card
2009-12-21T21:24:00.000Z	Karger78		mind you it's an SD card
2009-12-21T21:25:00.000Z	Karger78		it's only a class 6 SD card
2009-12-21T21:25:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	if the card was previously written to, it can take quite a while to write a whole new image
2009-12-21T21:26:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	sd erase blocks are very slow
2009-12-21T21:26:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	rather ^^^
2009-12-21T21:29:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	_far_ better to use a tarballed filesystem
2009-12-21T21:32:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	mount /path/to/image /mount/point -o loop
2009-12-21T21:36:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	after you've done the loop mount, check "df -h /mount/point"
2009-12-21T21:36:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	and then partition the sd card, mount the sd card, and rsync between the loop mount and the sd card ("rsync -vax /loop/mount/ /sd/mount/" should do it)
2009-12-21T21:37:00.000Z	cwillu_at_work	Karger78	but tell us the size, I'm interested :)
