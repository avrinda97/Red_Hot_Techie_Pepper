2012-04-02T06:22:00.000Z	CellTech		Well how do I make it just stop using it up? Windows never gave me these problems. I switched because i was sick of the crashing. Other then that Windows is the best with ram
2012-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	CellTech		What I'm sayingi j bnhvbv
2012-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	CellTech		What I'm saying is. I can be on the computer for like 10min. Fast and perfect. Then like 10min later. It's slower than hell and it's annoying
2012-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	using all your ram is a feature, not a bug. unused ram is wasted ram.
2012-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	linux uses the extra ram you have to do useful things like disk caching
2012-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	it's not the reason your computer is becoming slow (the kernel 'using up' all your ram)
2012-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	did you check the cpu/memory usage of the applications? which application is being a hog?
2012-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	linux is. again, this has nothing to do with the linux kernel
2012-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	type top, and figure out which process is slowing things down
2012-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	in the terminal.
2012-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	it will list all the processes, sorted by cpu use. you should also look at memory use
2012-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	how much cpu & mem is it using
2012-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	1.2 % and 2 % is very reasonable
2012-04-02T06:29:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	you could tyr installing iotop and see if anything is makign al ot of disk access
2012-04-02T06:31:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	try running gnome-system-monitor
2012-04-02T06:32:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	this does not appear to be a ram issue. i don't know why you are convinced it is
2012-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	you need to edit it with sudo or something that gives you root privileges
2012-04-02T07:58:00.000Z	anthropos	CellTech	vm.swappiness = whatever
