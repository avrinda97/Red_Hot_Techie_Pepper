2006-10-07T09:54:00.000Z	avagant		Guys I have a problem here. Haha
2006-10-07T09:54:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	don't we all...
2006-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	avagant	dgags	I don't know what's going on here, but I hope it's just a faux paux?
2006-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	i have no clue. just personal angst.
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	o_O
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	avagant	dgags	Does that make sense to you?
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	nope.
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	have you opened a terminal and done df -h?
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	I would trust that
2006-10-07T10:06:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	magnificent! Mystery solved... Next?
2006-10-07T10:07:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	but you just said it's not mounted... which is it?
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	what are we talking about here? USB drive?
2006-10-07T10:08:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	ok, so you just mounted the second drive, and it does not show up under df? how about mount?
2006-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	well, you can't mount /dev/hdb... youy usually have to specify a partition like /dev/hdb1
2006-10-07T10:10:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	then i would not expect your results to be normal.
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	I believe you, I just do not understand what you're doing, or trying to accomplish.
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	what's on that second hd?
2006-10-07T10:12:00.000Z	dgags	avagant	what partitions are on it? use fdisk to find out.
