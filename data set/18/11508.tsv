2006-07-31T09:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		does anyone know the first step in this command, sudo dpkg --get-selections- > out.txt
2006-07-31T09:18:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		the one that writes the out.txt file to begin with
2006-07-31T09:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		<frogzoo> cheers man excellent
2006-07-31T09:19:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	The > out.txt is the part that writes to out.txt (before the rest of the command is run). Is that what you meant?
2006-07-31T09:20:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	for what, the ">" part, or the dpkg command?
2006-07-31T09:21:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	^^^
2006-07-31T09:22:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	also, once you're reading the manual page for dpkg, if you type / (slash) followed by --get-sel, you should come to the part of the manual that (briefly) discusses that command.
2006-07-31T09:22:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	the very end of that manual also gives some examples.
2006-07-31T09:23:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	It would be --set-selections, I believe.
2006-07-31T09:25:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	I believe so (I actually haven't done this)
2006-07-31T09:27:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	if she has no net connection, I'm fairly sure it will be more complicated than that.
2006-07-31T09:28:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	She'll actually need the .deb files for each package you need to copy... each one listed in out.txt... that could be alot (although, you probably have a lot of packages in common already...)
2006-07-31T09:30:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	You might need to install it (sudo apt-get install apt-zip).
2006-07-31T09:32:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	AIUI, it lets you zip-up stuff on your computer that you want to install on another, and put it on a CD or somesuch. (I haven't used it)
2006-07-31T09:34:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	Then you may not need apt-zip :-)
2006-07-31T09:35:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	well, like the manual page says, that doesn't actually install anything. apt-zip may make your life easier anyway (I don't know)... I'm not sure exactly how I'd go about what you're trying to do :(
2006-07-31T09:38:00.000Z	micahcowan	Paddy_EIRE	Yeah, I haven't done that, myself, so I'm not sure how much help I'll be...
