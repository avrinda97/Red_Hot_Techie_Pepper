2007-03-29T05:45:00.000Z	TheCaptain	xtknight	It's a Acer Travelmate 8204WLMI, dual core. Let me grab the specs
2007-03-29T05:47:00.000Z	TheCaptain	xtknight	turns out its a mobility radeon x1600
2007-03-29T05:48:00.000Z	TheCaptain	xtknight	any other ideas?
2007-03-29T05:50:00.000Z	xtknight	TheCaptain	hmm how?
2007-03-29T05:50:00.000Z	xtknight	TheCaptain	use the alternate install cd if all else fails
2007-03-29T05:51:00.000Z	xtknight	TheCaptain	then you can stop gdm, edit xorg, fix it, and have a working system
2007-03-29T06:32:00.000Z	TheCaptain	xtknight	I tried every possible resolution and i tried loading it with live vga=771 but nothing is working. Also ctrl alt f12 leads to just a blinking cursor and no prompt
2007-03-29T06:33:00.000Z	xtknight	TheCaptain	hmm, odd.  did you try the 'acpi=verbose irqpoll' kernel options?
2007-03-29T06:34:00.000Z	TheCaptain	xtknight	not yet. I'll try that next.
