2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	socomm	phin	maybe your eth0 card comes loose when you move the cable.
2004-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	socomm	phin	yeah probably comes loose. That happend once when my audio card came loose.
2004-10-19T08:56:00.000Z	socomm	phin	you gotta edit your config files.
2004-10-19T08:56:00.000Z	socomm	phin	actually hold on.
2004-10-19T08:58:00.000Z	socomm	phin	That should do it for you.
2004-10-19T08:59:00.000Z	socomm	phin	so if you change it that will write over it?
2004-10-19T09:02:00.000Z	socomm	phin	use the 'locate' command to find the global config.
2004-10-19T09:02:00.000Z	socomm	phin	try backing that up something like 'mv menu-xdg menu-xdg.bak'
