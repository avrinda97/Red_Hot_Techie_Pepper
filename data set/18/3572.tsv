2009-10-23T02:57:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	nemesis1911	Or any other video device you might have attached.

2009-10-23T03:00:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	nemesis1911	Open VLC and go to Media->Open Capture Device
2009-10-23T03:01:00.000Z	nemesis1911		Xtreme_Great.. I'm there what to I put into the video device name and the audio device name?
2009-10-23T03:01:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	nemesis1911	In the video device you give /dev/video1. In audio device, you give the audio device in /dev. I don't quite know which one it would be in your case. In case of microphones it is /dev/dsp.
2009-10-23T03:02:00.000Z	nemesis1911		Xtreme_Great.. dsp1 is webcam mic. and none of the thers work and when I do it that way /dev/video1 don't show any video
