2007-09-18T11:54:00.000Z	dwxreaper		i love this ubuntu but vnc is so damn slow :/
2007-09-18T11:54:00.000Z	dwxreaper		where remote desktop is fast as hell, and all i use is remote connection
2007-09-18T11:54:00.000Z	dwxreaper		how do i make it fast.
2007-09-18T11:54:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	what is the client?
2007-09-18T11:55:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	what server are you using in Ubuntu?
2007-09-18T11:56:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	which one exactly? vino (gnome built-in), vnc4server, etc...?
2007-09-18T11:56:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	tightvnc?
2007-09-18T11:57:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	you might try the bult in, or vnc4server, and use the vnc 4 client on windows, it works better than tightvnc now I"ve found
2007-09-18T11:57:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	I'm running that on a lan at work
2007-09-18T11:58:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	it's better
2007-09-18T11:58:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	than tight, not remote desktop ;)
2007-09-18T11:58:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	it works extremely well
2007-09-18T12:00:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	I wouldn't either, try our suggestion and see if it's better
2007-09-18T12:00:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	the gnome-built in, or vnc4server, and vnc4 client on windows
2007-09-18T12:00:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	tightvnc hasn't been developed in years
2007-09-18T12:02:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	dwxreaper http://www.realvnc.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi
2007-09-18T12:03:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	sorry, http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/download.html
2007-09-18T12:09:00.000Z	astro76	dwxreaper	we did that scenario at work too, the cygwin xserver performed poorly and we ended up using a commercial windows xserver
