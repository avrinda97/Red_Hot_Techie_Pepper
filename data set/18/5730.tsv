2008-10-25T14:00:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	ok can you fire up a terminal and run some commands?
2008-10-25T14:01:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	ok type this sudo mkdir /media/usb-disk
2008-10-25T14:01:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	then type sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb-disk
2008-10-25T14:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	ok then you need to install pmount and allow other uses in /etc/pmount.allow
2008-10-25T14:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	sudo apt-get install pmount

2008-10-26T11:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	rummy	well, the good news is you cant; the bad is that you can install crossover office and open them, export the records to csv and import into mysql or postgres
