2006-02-24T17:55:00.000Z	koto		where can I download the lastest developer version of ubuntu? want to enjoy all the lastest gnome goodies :)
2006-02-24T17:56:00.000Z	Ng	koto	you can either upgrade a breezy install or install one of the dapper flight releases. however it is unstable until april. when it breaks you get to keep the pieces ;)
2006-02-24T17:59:00.000Z	koto	Ng	will it be easy to upgrade from flight to 6.04 or will i have to do a fresh install?
2006-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Ng	koto	you can just upgrade, but I would recommend a clean install if possible
2006-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	koto	Ng	why do you recommend a clean install
2006-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	Ng	koto	if you're upgrading, especially through a development version, your system won't be the same as if you reinstall. I keep /home on a separate partition so I can easily blow away my / and have it be completely clean
2006-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	koto	Ng	why is this so?
2006-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	Ng	koto	any number of reasons. apt is very good, but it's not perfect. I'm only talking about small differences here, but I like to keep my systems as clean as I can
2006-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	koto	Ng	but apt-get update will just pull the current packages, right? so the only thing which can go wrong are config files
2006-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Ng	koto	mostly, but to give you an example, when I went hoary->breezy I never got graphical bootups because nothing had ever bothered to install the newer version of grub to my MBR. Granted that's a tiny tiny thing and doesn't matter, but it means my install was slightly different to breezy, which annoys me. Like I said, it's just minor things
2006-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	koto	Ng	I see. so you just get updates of the old features. but you won't see new ones. but I could pull them manually (if I only new that they exist)
2006-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	Ng	koto	it's still not that simple, you'll get a lot of them. I suppose the best thing to do would be to just upgrade and then only re-install if things are a bit weird/broken (which you're unlikely to notice I would think)
2006-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	koto	Ng	I just don't want to go trough the hell of upgrading/reinstalling and loosing all my system config settings. I hated that with suse and redhat and that's why I currently use gentoo. but I'm tired of keeping my system up to date manually
2006-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	Ng	koto	then go for it ;)
2006-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	koto	Ng	so will I also be able to just upgrade my install with a new version of ubuntu using a CD image of the latest version?
2006-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	Ng	koto	yeah, when you insert an ubuntu cd it should offer to upgrade
2006-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	koto	Ng	and this WON'T break my config files, right?
2006-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	Ng	koto	correct. just stick the cd in and ubuntu will notice it and start up synaptic to do the upgrade while you're logged in
