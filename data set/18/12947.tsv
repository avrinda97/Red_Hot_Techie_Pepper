2006-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	true, there's a way to go before 'aunt tilly' will enjoy it - I'm not sure that's an important goal, as windows and macos provide that environment
2006-03-01T09:18:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	that is not true IMHO - there are certain niche products that may never have a Free equiv.
2006-03-01T09:19:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	Have a free what?
2006-03-01T09:19:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	equivalent - for instance, there's no good Free CAD sw that I'm aware of
2006-03-01T09:20:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	You lost me entirely. Can you elaborate?
2006-03-01T09:20:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	there is a huge amount of Free sw, so what's this problem of linux application development that you see?
2006-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	So you're saying that only free software may run on Linux?
2006-03-01T09:21:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	where did I say that? I myself prefer not to run anything else
2006-03-01T09:22:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	So where do we disagree?
2006-03-01T09:22:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	I thought you said there was a problem with sw being developed for linux because it has a small userbase
2006-03-01T09:23:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	what is it? file foo.run would tell you
2006-03-01T09:23:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	Yes.
2006-03-01T09:24:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	I see no such problem, I have approx 15,000 software packages available in debian, and source tarballs for a huge amount more - where is the shortage?
2006-03-01T09:24:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	Games, for example.
2006-03-01T09:25:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	ah, games - I don't play 'em, so that's not a problem for me; perhaps a game console is a solution?
2006-03-01T09:26:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	heh - I know nothing about 'em, so apologies if that was a foolish remark
2006-03-01T09:26:00.000Z	Quinch	amphi	Ehh, let's just say I've got a chip on my shoulder about them and leave it at that.
2006-03-01T09:27:00.000Z	amphi	Quinch	I saw a psp once, it seemed ok, not that I want one
