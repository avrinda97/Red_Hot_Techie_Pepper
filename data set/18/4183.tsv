2009-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	dbaker2		what is the difference between java jdk and jre. Which one do I need to run jedit on ubuntu?
2009-05-22T16:40:00.000Z	RkRaj	dbaker2	You need both but the difference is that using JDK you can develop and you can run the program only if you have the JRE
2009-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	dbaker2	RkRaj	so why do I need both? For running it don't I need only jre?
2009-05-22T16:43:00.000Z	RkRaj	dbaker2	 yes ofcourse you can have only JRE for because Jedit is as same as JDK in wndows
2009-05-22T16:44:00.000Z	RkRaj	dbaker2	 yes! But jedit is more powerful than JDK in windows according to my knowledge
2009-05-22T16:45:00.000Z	dbaker2	RkRaj	isn't jdk - java development kit? what jedit has to do with this?
