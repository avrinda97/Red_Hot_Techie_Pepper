2009-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	windows installation will overwrite your MBR so after installing windows you need to reinstall GRUB
2009-10-09T13:58:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	unless of course if your GRUB is on a different than primary partition
2009-10-09T13:59:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	is the dv connected through firewire?
2009-10-09T14:01:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	i remember having problems with a dv tru firewire, there was a conf file somwhere that needed minor edit to work
2009-10-09T14:02:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	this might help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firewire
2009-10-09T14:05:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	first you install virtualbox, then you can add virtual machines, which you install once and can use when you need
2009-10-09T14:06:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	check http://www.virtualbox.org/
2009-10-09T14:07:00.000Z	cabaro	stoki	virtualbox is pretty straight forward, it has a simple gui
