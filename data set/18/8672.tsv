2008-06-22T03:08:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	do you use gnombaker or k3b on Gnone?
2008-06-22T03:08:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	gnomebaker
2008-07-05T03:29:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	Hello, May I please ask you to verify for me if mandvd is safe for me to install from http://www.getdeb.net/release/2881 ?
2008-07-05T03:35:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	I personally use nearly nothing outside the repos
2008-07-05T03:36:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	I have never installed anything outside of repos. But i want a good DVD authoring program.  joaopinto recommendd mandvd from http://www.getdeb.net/release/2881.  But I am not sure its safe
2008-07-05T03:36:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	getdeb has a long reputation
2008-07-05T03:36:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	so you think mandvd from http://www.getdeb.net/release/2881 would be rather safe?
2008-07-05T03:37:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	I"ve never heard anything that says getdeb is an unreliable source. And I would if it was suspected
2008-07-05T03:37:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	ok thanks
2008-07-05T03:39:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	or, if you're feeling frisky, try compiling it yourself from the sources
2008-07-05T03:40:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	but how do I know the source code is reliable? I cannot understand source code.  So its the same thing. dont know if I can trust anything from outside the repos
2008-07-05T03:40:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	gotta trust somewhere. The original source is what the repos start with. So, if you get the source from the original site, you're as safe as you can get
2008-07-05T03:45:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	this is getting repetitive, if you want to continue searching for a handle on trust over irc, please continue it on #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-07-05T03:46:00.000Z	purplestar	nickrud	ok
2008-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	purplestar	that is not helpful
