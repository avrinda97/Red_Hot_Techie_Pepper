2011-05-09T09:15:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	done that, doesn't disable desktop effects
2011-05-09T09:17:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	how did you fix your problems?
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	lol, that's hectic. i killed compiz and ubuntu just whacked out
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	Gskellig	nikhil_	my problem was actually two graphics cards running at once, among OTHER power comsumption issues
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	^_^
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	reinstall compiz?
2011-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	worst case...reinstall. You do have a separate home partition right?
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	ah. never used wubi.
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	what do you use windows for?
2011-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	lol. for that you could boot a livecd from usb
2011-05-09T09:20:00.000Z	Gskellig	nikhil_	 what issues are you having exactly with power?
2011-05-09T09:22:00.000Z	nikhil_	Gskellig	no real issues, i just know these desktop effects are draining my battery faster than it should be drained. in kde i had an option to turn off all effects. at this rate my 1 year old battery is going to last 45mins
