2006-08-21T13:48:00.000Z	Gibbster		Hello friendly ubuntu gurus! I have a question for you! I have a laptop that I set up as a server. I'm running ssh on said server. It works when I set it up, but after 30 mins or so, it stops working. When I check it out locally, it works again.
2006-08-21T13:48:00.000Z	Gibbster		Until 30 mins later...
2006-08-21T13:49:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	it's not by any chance going into power saving mode and closing network connections, is it?
2006-08-21T13:50:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	I thought so, but the gnome settings say that only the display shuts down
2006-08-21T13:53:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	not sure. try waiting thirty minutes then pinging the machine - if it works, ssh problem, if it fails, acpi problem
2006-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	Ah. That I can tell you
2006-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	last time it happened, it pinged ok, but ssh timed out
2006-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	annoying problem to solve, since whenever I change something on the server, I need to wait half an hour to see if it fixed it ;-)
2006-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	can you crank down the sleep mode timing to five minutes?
2006-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	yeah. I'll try that
2006-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	then that'd speed things up or show it's not related to sleep mode
2006-08-21T14:17:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	rather
2006-08-21T14:18:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	hmm
2006-08-21T14:19:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	does sshd have a debugging/ heavy logging option?
2006-08-21T15:07:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	hi again. Tried looking up logging info, sshd faq, with no luck
2006-08-21T15:07:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	and I still don't know exactly how long it takes to stop working
2006-08-21T15:07:00.000Z	Gibbster	rkd	longer than 5 minutes, certainly
2006-08-21T15:08:00.000Z	rkd	Gibbster	did it decrease when you decreased the powersaving sleep time?
