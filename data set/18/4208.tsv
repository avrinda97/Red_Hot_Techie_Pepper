2009-09-17T00:40:00.000Z	gsp2009		hey all... I am having a hard time setting up a network with shares between two boxes running 9.04. All the googling I have done centres around Windoze and Samba. Surely there should be a way to set up a network without Samba so that I can easily have a shared resource over my network. Anyone have a link?
2009-09-17T00:42:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	you could try NFS if you don't like samba... but samba is pretty convenient
2009-09-17T00:43:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	addisonj so if I do use samba, do I have to set each machine up with a workgroup name?
2009-09-17T00:43:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	if you have NFS setup, then the remote file systems are mounted locally...
2009-09-17T00:44:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	in other words, NFS "shares" are seen as part of the local file system, nautlus doesn't know the difference, nor does it need to
2009-09-17T00:44:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	so I have to mount each resource? anyway of bookmarking them?
2009-09-17T00:45:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	I recommend reading the samba documents to gain a basic understanding of the concepts. If you're looking for a quick and dirty copy from one machine to the next, samba is a good solution.
2009-09-17T00:46:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	NFS is intended for far more permanent connections between machines, it's not really designed for making and breaking arbitrary connections
2009-09-17T00:48:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	thanks. I have used samba before. With great success. I just figured that because I have no windows machines, there would be a cleaner and easier way to set up shares between machines on the same network. Maybe I am wrong, but you would think that ubuntu would handle this easily without having samba running. If that is the quickest and most intuitive way of doing it then I guess I have not choice. I just want this to be easy for my wife to d
2009-09-17T00:49:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	if you have a small file to copy as a once off, then use sftp://machinename inside of nautilus
2009-09-17T00:50:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	that requires no special setup (other than basic user accounts on both machines) I wouldn't recommend it for copying many GB of data though... it's a bit slow because of encryption, but perfect for a quick copy of small to medium sized data
2009-09-17T00:53:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	thanks. will look into that
2009-09-17T00:54:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	that's what I do if I need to copy files to machines at work (I use ubuntu all day) it's the simplest. If coupled with key based authenticated SSH from machine to machine. Very secure and very convenient.
2009-09-17T00:55:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	well... the issue is that my wife is not overly technical, and we are sharing large photos and video. So I may be stuck with Samba.
2009-09-17T00:57:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	it's really easy to use SFTP... just make an acount on your machine for her (regular shell account) then go to her machine, put sftp://yourmachine into her finder, connect, save a bookmark and show her where to click it (in places)
2009-09-17T00:58:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	and if there is half a gig or so, that may be a prob?
2009-09-17T00:58:00.000Z	aethelrick	gsp2009	it won't be as fast as samba, but there is no upper limit on size of data you can copy
2009-09-17T00:59:00.000Z	gsp2009	aethelrick	ok, thanks.
