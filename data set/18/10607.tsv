2007-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	not the apt-get log, i want a full log of all package changes
2007-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	each package has its own changelog
2007-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	i need to if XChat updated yesterday, how do i check?

2007-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	yes
2007-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	how would i check the last time xchat updated?
2007-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	i guess you could look in /var/cache/apt/archives/ to see if there is an older xchat package there.
2007-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	there is, but i want a date on when xchat was last updated
2007-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	well the new xchat package should be in there as well.  Just look at the date of the file
2007-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	ls -l
2007-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	what did you say?
2007-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	Some_Person	h1st0	sorry, i had to spray my computer with bug spray
2007-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	h1st0	Some_Person	if you ls -l /var/cache/apt/archives | grep xchat will show you some dates
