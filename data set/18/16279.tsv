2005-01-29T16:31:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	there may be "lore" arguments, but I think the word hacker came from maybe as far back as the 50's when the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT would 'hack' together changes for their railroad.  The signaling and wiring people were the same sorts who started 'hacking' early computer electronics hardware
2005-01-29T16:34:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	but hey, it's all just lore.  Worms and Viruses are not nice, but you can protect yourself.  Using Open Source is a good step.
2005-01-29T16:35:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	 Check out this link for an article about a firewall program called Firestarter: http://security.linux.com/security/05/01/03/2250258.shtml?tid=49&tid=47&tid=35
2005-01-29T16:37:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	 err... what jdub said.  Firestarter is a nice GUI-way of managing the built-in firewall features in Linux
2005-01-29T16:40:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	lol
2005-01-29T16:45:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	the code that 'touches' packets at the low levels of the network drivers is in the kernel.  So, too, the code that can scan and filter them.  Firestarter is a program that has 'permission' to change those settings.  So you want to make sure a trusted (root) user is the one mucking with those settings... thus you run Firestarter as root.  you don't want anyone else being able to do that.  Does that help?  It is not a security 'problem', it is an importa
2005-01-29T16:48:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	 Yes, I am already running on Hoary pre-release.  You just change the sources in the package manager and upgrade your packages
2005-01-29T16:49:00.000Z	mojo_	ideafix	different strokes for different folks... it's all democratic dude.  PS - why are you so agro?  You try to provoke and seem hostile.
