2005-06-04T15:56:00.000Z	zubuntu		hi folks :) daddy zubuntu's here :)
2005-06-04T15:58:00.000Z	zubuntu		weiredAl, why the hell have you to do that? :)
2005-06-04T15:58:00.000Z	zubuntu		aha..
2005-06-04T15:59:00.000Z	zubuntu		don't know actually
2005-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	zubuntu		I'll always wonder why should a natural man use such stuff
2005-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	zubuntu		isn't there any graphical piece of software to use instead of these command lines?
2005-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	zubuntu		really?
2005-06-04T16:01:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	what do you mean?
2005-06-04T16:02:00.000Z	zubuntu	lesshaste	i mean i think ubuntu is a desktop distro and by fact should be accessible
2005-06-04T16:03:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	you mean have pictures for all of bash? :)
2005-06-04T16:03:00.000Z	zubuntu	lesshaste	:) i'm a science computer ingineer :)
2005-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	zubuntu	lesshaste	i meant for a distro like ubuntu, stuff should be intuitive
2005-06-04T16:04:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	which stuff?
2005-06-04T16:05:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	doing "ls -l|xargs" ?
2005-06-04T16:06:00.000Z	zubuntu	lesshaste	yes "ls -l|xarg". you and I know what it does mean but not the average "ubuntu" user
2005-06-04T16:12:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	you would have to come up with specific examples of usefull GUI tools
2005-06-04T16:14:00.000Z	zubuntu	lesshaste	I didn't meant for a specifical problem but I was talking about the general aim of ubuntu ansd I suggested to develop stuff to give the average user a chance to use this nice OS
2005-06-04T16:14:00.000Z	lesshaste	zubuntu	see my previous comment :)
