2008-06-11T14:06:00.000Z	jackinloadup		hey all, im having a slight problem with changing my uid. the usermod  -u uid user_name  command seemed to work but it didnt set the uid recursively so there are tons of errors when logging in. any ideas?
2008-06-11T14:06:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	see 'man chown'
2008-06-11T14:06:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	will do.. brb ;-)
2008-06-11T14:11:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	so im thinking i should use usermod to change my uid then use chown on my home file like so: chown -hR jackinloadup /home/jackinloadup
2008-06-11T14:11:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	yup, if ownership is the problem
2008-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	i will try it out thanks ^_^
2008-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	put your startups before the 'exit 0' line
2008-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	what do u mean the exit 0 line?
2008-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	/etc/rc.local doesnt run anything by default...there is an 'exit o' at the last line of the file
2008-06-11T14:16:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	i dont understand how that would help my uid problem? in any case i cant think of anything that "i" tell to startup. everything should be default
2008-06-11T14:17:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	sorry, that wasnt meant for you
2008-06-11T14:32:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	hey i chown helped my uid problem a lot but im still having a problem none of my gnome-panel things are showing up and i cant seem to launch it with alt-f2 any ideas as to what other files i might need to chown?
2008-06-11T14:33:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	you can just add them to your panel, rightclick then add
2008-06-11T14:35:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	yeah tried that.. :-( it doesnt show up its just create folder and stuff. just to clarify there are no panels launched at the moment and trying to launch them manually fails
2008-06-11T14:35:00.000Z	tech0007	jackinloadup	just exactly what happend before this?
2008-06-11T14:37:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	i changed my uid and chown my home folder and a few tmp/ folders that were listed with my name.. it logged in clean but no gnome-panels are showing up. i got a terminal window up and tried running 'gnome-panel' and it says a panel is running.. cant see it though.
2008-06-11T14:41:00.000Z	jackinloadup	tech0007	i think i solved my problem.. THANK YOU! for your help chown worked like a charm
