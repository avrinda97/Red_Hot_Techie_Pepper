2007-07-31T06:51:00.000Z	therethinker		NemisisD: add the -x flag
2007-07-31T06:51:00.000Z	therethinker		NemisisD: Whoops, -X flag, uppercase
2007-07-31T06:52:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	thank you!
2007-07-31T06:57:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	is ssh supposed to do something like ask me for a password? it's just sitting there
2007-07-31T06:57:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	Make sure that the computer is on :P I've had that problem.
2007-07-31T06:58:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	i have it on good authority that the computer is on and set up for port forwarding
2007-07-31T06:59:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	hmm... is sshd running?
2007-07-31T06:59:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	sshd?
2007-07-31T06:59:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	The ssh server
2007-07-31T07:00:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	i told them to do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start, is that the correct way, and does the fact that I can't ping the machine indicate there may be another problem?
2007-07-31T07:00:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	hmm.. if you can't ping it that's probably a bad sign -- then again, did you ping on port 22?
2007-07-31T07:01:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	how do you do do that with network tools, theres no port field
2007-07-31T07:01:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	in terminal: ping IPADDR:22
2007-07-31T07:04:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	it doesn't like that :22 part it says unknown host
2007-07-31T07:07:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	what about ping IP:80 ?
2007-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	NemesisD	therethinker	i think that syntax is wrong or something
2007-07-31T07:08:00.000Z	therethinker	NemesisD	Hmm... Sorry XD
