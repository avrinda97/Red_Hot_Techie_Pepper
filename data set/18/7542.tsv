2008-05-05T01:42:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	but thats on my debian machine, ubuntu automounts it for me
2008-05-05T01:41:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	i use: /dev/sdb2       /media/ipod     vfat    defaults,rw,user,noauto,umask=000  0       0
2008-05-05T01:41:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	and with that one you are able to mount and read/write as user?
2008-05-05T01:42:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	yes
2008-05-05T01:43:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	Ok, we'll my fstab was a bit messed up before but now it's sorted and works perfectly apart from my shuffle... I'll give your suggestion a try as well! Thanks a lot :)
2008-05-05T01:43:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	i did a sudo chown thruxton:thruxton /media/ipod
2008-05-05T01:43:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	thats with device unmounted
2008-05-05T01:44:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	hmm actually that owner is probably it.. haven't changed that yet... gaah, cheers!
2008-05-05T01:44:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	np
2008-05-05T01:45:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	the proper way is associate a group for ipod users I suppose but for a single user box chown is good enough for me
2008-05-05T01:49:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	yeah, it's good enough for me as well since I'm the only one on this computer as well... Didn't work with just the chown though... have to try your parameters as well... restart now, brb :)
2008-05-05T01:56:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	unfortunately those parameters didn't do it for me I'm afraid. The shuffle appears on my desktop but when trying to right click - mount it, i'll receive an error message saying "Permissions missing" or "No permissions" or something similar in English... Any ideas please?
2008-05-05T01:57:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	what is it mounted on? /media/ipod? find the mount point and do an ls -la on it
2008-05-05T02:00:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	nothing seemed to be mounted there (/media/ipodShuffle)... i deleted the folder ipodShuffle after that... Do i need to manually create a folder there first or will it create one automatically?
2008-05-05T02:02:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	i would create the folder, change the perms as root/sudo with the device unplugged and then try it again
2008-05-05T02:06:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	ok tried with creating the folder, changing owner with the ipod unplugged, i then plugged it in again but received the same error... although, I now tried accessing it from Amarok gui and it worked perfectly... I think my issue might have been a graphical issue perhaps? All my other mounted devs have a green dot next to them when they are mounted, my ipod icon didn't :/ Thanks for all your help and time in this matter!
2008-05-05T02:08:00.000Z	thruxton	tzd	hmm, well im sorry its not working perfectly but your on the right track at least!
2008-05-05T02:08:00.000Z	tzd	thruxton	actually, now when I've accessed my ipod from within Amarok I now see that green dot next to my ipod on my desktop... sorry, my bad :/
