2005-10-01T12:00:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		ok, i have a serious problem here please ;  i would have lots to paste but i'm in the middle of a breezy update, and cannot open firefox  ; basically, theres a small bug at the end of my install that just...stopped it
2005-10-01T12:01:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	no one can possibly help you without seeing the error
2005-10-01T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	your question is confusing
2005-10-01T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	where you upgrading hoary or actually installing breezy?
2005-10-01T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	right
2005-10-01T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	rerun dist-upgrade, yes
2005-10-02T11:16:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	xmms doesn't know or care if you have "mp3 support installed"
2005-10-02T11:16:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	did you yrll it to use esound for sound output?
2005-10-02T11:18:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bob2	, i think you will have to be more explicit /tell me what to look for...
2005-10-02T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	go to preferences. select output. pick esound.
2005-10-02T11:19:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bob2	ok, have selected esound closed and restart, still doesnt work
2005-10-02T11:20:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	"doesnt work" is not a useful description of the problem
2005-10-02T11:20:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bob2	well, it shows the same things than before : wich is, 3 choice why it could possibly not work
2005-10-02T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	does sound work at all?
2005-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp
2005-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bob2	yes i hear it
2005-10-02T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	B_166-ER-X	"pkill esd", tell xmms to use oss again
2005-10-02T11:23:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bob2	what do you mean by 'oss'
