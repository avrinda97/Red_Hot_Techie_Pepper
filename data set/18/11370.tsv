2006-10-08T15:09:00.000Z	EkUmBa		yes
2006-10-08T15:11:00.000Z	EkUmBa		Enselic:okay,i have started nautilus with root permission,and i'm able to delete the files.how can i always start nautlis with root permission?as default?
2006-10-08T15:12:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	well you shouldn't use the root account all the time
2006-10-08T15:12:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	put your files in the your home directory always
2006-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	and install software and such as root only,dont use root for common computer work
2006-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	then you must have accidentally moved them there with the root
2006-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	stay away from using root, and you should be fine
2006-10-08T15:13:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	for intsance, if you make a sudo make install and some files are copied to your home directory
2006-10-08T15:14:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	then the "nromal" you will not be able to change those file
2006-10-08T15:15:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	use nautilus as root (sudo nautilus in terminal), right click on the files, permissions, and set the permission as you want them
2006-10-08T15:16:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	Right Click -> Properties -> Permissions I belive
2006-10-08T15:20:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	It's probably because it wants to preview them, you can change that in Edit -> Preferences -> Previews
2006-10-08T15:20:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	(I use the swedish version, so the names might be wrong)
2006-10-08T15:25:00.000Z	Enselic	EkUmBa	np :)
