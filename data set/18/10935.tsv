2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	willys_fueguino		someone can recomend me a keylogger to spy amsn conversations on localhost??
2006-10-05T14:06:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	willys_fueguino	I'd recommend a packet sniffer, google it
2006-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	I have ethereal...
2006-10-05T14:07:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	But i dont know hot to make it work to see amsn conversations only
2006-10-05T14:08:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	willys_fueguino	did you search already for etherreal and msn related pages?
2006-10-05T14:08:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	I readed some pages about filters and that if thats what you mean...
2006-10-05T14:09:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	willys_fueguino	another way to do it would be convince the user to use gaim and then set beagle up to take in all conversations
2006-10-05T14:09:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	willys_fueguino	yeah, there aren't any filters for MSN yet?
2006-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	hell yeah!! but I want to see only what keys the user is pressing...
2006-10-05T14:10:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	xDDD
2006-10-05T14:13:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	I think so
2006-10-05T14:15:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	willys_fueguino	those are keypresses, and they show exactly what keys are being pressed :-D, this is the low level representation all the software uses to understand your keyboard
2006-10-05T14:17:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	info is more helpful than man
2006-10-05T14:23:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	swashbucklinstev	I LOVE YOU!!!!!!
