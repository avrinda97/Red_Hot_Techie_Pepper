2008-08-02T16:27:00.000Z	_dennister		gm channel....having great difficulties configuring this system (for a blind user) so that x doesn't load at boot...would anyone be able to help me with these runlevels and stuff?  wading thru all the documentation hasn't helped...still stumped
2008-08-02T16:27:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	why are you trying ot make it so X doesn't load at boot?
2008-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	_dennister	Flannel	because the primary user is blind...literally...work with him at the canadian national instiute for the blind
2008-08-02T16:28:00.000Z	_dennister		second user (girlfriend) is sighted
2008-08-02T16:29:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	and the GUI screen readers won't work? (I admit I'm not too familiar with how this all works)
2008-08-02T16:29:00.000Z	_dennister	Flannel	console is faster, he likes text-based apps like lynx...etc
2008-08-02T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	and he can't use a tty? (ctrl-alt-f1 through f6? with ctrl-alt-f7 getting back to the GUI)
2008-08-02T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	I mean, he can't just switch to a tty to log in, with X still running
2008-08-02T16:31:00.000Z	_dennister		let me try that...i'm sighted, and try to stick with the gui so i don't forget it and can support newbies...
2008-08-02T16:32:00.000Z	_dennister		oh lordy....that was easy
2008-08-02T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	If you still want to change runlevels, you'd have to tweak runlevel2 to be text only (in ubuntu/debian, 2-5 are the same) and then have 3-5 be GUI, boot to 2 by default, change to 3 when you want a GUI.
2008-08-02T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	but, I think gettys solve your problem
2008-08-02T16:33:00.000Z	_dennister		and here i was wasting all this time with grub, inittab, runlevels...i've already tried making rl3 text-only, but that didn't work even with all the documentation...nothing did
2008-08-02T16:34:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	there's probably something you can change to make it so tty1 (or 2-6) comes up by default, so then you'd be switching to X as the alternate.
2008-08-02T16:35:00.000Z	_dennister	Flannel	using X as the alternate means you lose the recovery mode as the alternate, so I'd prefer not to do that
2008-08-02T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	no, no.  I meant so instead of starting on tty7 (gdm) you start on tty1 (a text login)
2008-08-02T16:37:00.000Z	_dennister		besides, i like the sounds that are activated for the blind user when it's time to login...have been installing screen readers in the gui, but all screen readers and speech synthesizers have their issues, so its hard for them to hkeep up with all the info on the gui
2008-08-02T16:37:00.000Z	Flannel	_dennister	alright, well, glad we could come up with an easy solution.
