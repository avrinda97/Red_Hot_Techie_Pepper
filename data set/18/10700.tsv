2006-11-01T17:46:00.000Z	kaflan		hellow. how to make kdesu prompt for root password instead of the password of the invoking user? (i totally do sudo passwd root, and patch /etc/sudoers with rootpw argument).

2006-11-01T17:47:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	sorry, pressed send to soon :)
2006-11-01T17:47:00.000Z	kaflan		dowstar: np
2006-11-01T17:48:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	afaik sudo is meant to work that way. kdesu on ubuntu is patched to use sudo. for not too long there has been native support for sudo in kdesu, not sure if thats a compile time flag or an option though
2006-11-01T17:49:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	meaning: i dont think thats possible using a standard ubuntu installation
2006-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	kaflan	drowstar	but why in manual developers write about sudo passwd root and /etc/sudoers commands?
2006-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	hum, not sure. give me a second, I'll try to get up to speed on sudoers real quick :)
2006-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	kaflan	drowstar	couse i will wait :) thx for helping
2006-11-01T17:59:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	alright: I am not a sudo expert, but from what I have gathered (and I have not found anything indicating the contrary) that is really and truely not possible :) since you need to have the root account enabled anyway you can use the "su" command to get root priviledges in a terminal. I dont think you can use kdesu for that though. could you explain where you found "but why in manual developers write about sudo passwd root and
2006-11-01T17:59:00.000Z	drowstar		/etc/sudoers commands" as you wrote earlier?
2006-11-01T17:59:00.000Z	drowstar		sorry to ask again guys, but I haven't been able to solve this problem with google: I have installed ubuntu-desktop on a fresh _K_ubuntu edgy installation and gtk2-themes don't work (I get solid grey squares instead of buttons for example). any hints?

2006-11-01T06:00:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	ah, cool, never seen that before :) does that not work?
2006-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	kaflan		work only for console, su and sudo, but not for kdesu
2006-11-01T06:01:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	ah, I see...
2006-11-01T06:06:00.000Z	drowstar	kaflan	hm, my experiments dont really get me anywhere :) sorry, I dont think theres a way
2006-11-01T06:07:00.000Z	kaflan	drowstar	np, but, thx for helping.
