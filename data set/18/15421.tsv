2005-03-28T14:49:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	what is the equivalent command of service network restart in ubuntu?
2005-03-28T14:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 since i odn't know that command, i'm not sure.  what should it accomplish?
2005-03-28T14:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 oh nm, i got it in context of what you asked before:  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-03-28T14:51:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	i edit interface and want to make that change work
2005-03-28T14:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 for eth0?
2005-03-28T14:51:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	yes
2005-03-28T14:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 i would just do this: sudo ifdown eth0 (which will probably say it wasn't up) then sudo ifup eth0
2005-03-28T14:53:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	got it, another question where do i edit gateway i'll be using?
2005-03-28T14:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 the gw setting in ifconfig?  you can add "gateway" line in the eth0 stanza of that file, iirc
2005-03-28T14:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 type "man 5 interfaces" to get the exact syntax
2005-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 i believe you mean sudo /etc/init.d/foo restart
2005-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	foo it the command?
2005-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 what is an example service?
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	httpd
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	or smb
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	turf	 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2005-04-08T05:23:00.000Z	turf	eyequeue	got it thanks
