2008-11-14T12:31:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿ akahige:when in grub and doing setup, mention sdxy  starts with y=1 while grub's hd(x,Y) starts with y = 0 so /dev/sda1 is hd (0,0)
2008-11-14T12:33:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿WIGGMPk: run a e2fsck from live with hd unmounted or check /var/sys/syslog  for faulty drive
2008-11-14T12:34:00.000Z	DasE1		﻿WIGGMPk:  /var/log/syslog  for faulty drive  ,sry
2008-11-14T12:34:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	running fsck -f -y from Live is usually how I get everything back to normal.. but ill look thru the syslog, but im horrible at that, should I look for something specific?
2008-11-14T12:36:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	before I give you the link, I just want to tell you that is the coolest f'n thing I have seen in the command line.. I love you...!!!! seriously... http://pastebin.com/f39e57bde
2008-11-14T12:38:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	lemme get you a different syslog, I just noticed that is rather short for today...
2008-11-14T12:40:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	well I didnt have my laptop on yesterday, just turned it on today like 30mins ago.. lemme get the previous log.. for some reason pastebin.com is being weird

2008-11-14T12:48:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	thats about the time is happened if I remember correctly
2008-11-14T12:55:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	no, its an internal hard drive
2008-11-14T13:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	hate to be a nag, but does this rule out the possibility that its the RAM? and since this happened with a different hard drive, and a brand new one, would it be the motherboard connection then?
2008-11-14T13:04:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	your message above, I preform that to each partition? /boot, /root, /home (all are separate)
2008-11-14T13:05:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	im not sure I follow with special commands...? and what you mean by check smart.. I know about SMART drives, but what exactly (or where) would I look for that (or just google it?)
2008-11-14T13:09:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	DasE1	k, I appreciate all your help and information, im gonna give this a try after Im finished burning these images. djhedges thanks for your advise as well
