2008-01-18T21:11:00.000Z	LjL	neverblue	it probably is just the host. however, since that upgrade is broken anyway, better to just wait ;)

2008-01-25T01:50:00.000Z	neverblue	LjL	well, with sufficient amount of RAM, does that really matter, I have 3GB myself
2008-01-25T01:50:00.000Z	LjL	neverblue	yes, it may matter, because you may not be able to use hibernation if your swap is less than your RAM
2008-01-25T01:50:00.000Z	neverblue	LjL	ah, good point
