2005-06-08T13:45:00.000Z	Fanskapet		agh.. doesn't ndiswrapper support scanning??
2005-06-08T13:46:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	it does for me
2005-06-08T13:46:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	well for me too but i read something about that in the forum.. regarding that gtkwifi gui
2005-06-08T13:48:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	if it's a good written app that is :)
2005-06-08T13:48:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	fair enough ;)  I always recommend people upgrade to ndiswrapper 1.1 anyway... works much better for me than the ndiswrapper in hoary
2005-06-08T13:48:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	well i use that RC1 one :)
2005-06-08T13:49:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	I'm on 64bit, and it wouldn't work at all until I got 1.1 from ndiswrapper.sf.net
2005-06-08T13:49:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	there's a wiki for amd64 ubunto with ndiswrapper I helped write...
2005-06-08T13:50:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	yeah i know.. but i couldn't get the previus version to work.. so i downloaded the latest one.
2005-06-08T13:50:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	so what version are you using then?
2005-06-08T13:51:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	ndiswrapper-1.2-rc1
2005-06-08T13:54:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	yeah, gui sucks :) ...seriously though, what's wrong with the network tool that comes with ubuntu?  I guess it doesn't let you set up wpa if you need that
2005-06-08T13:58:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	well i prefer a app in the tray that shows a baloon popup when a new network is around and that stuff.
2005-06-08T13:59:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	doesn't that already happen?  it works in mine
2005-06-08T13:59:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	nah not with the ordinary gui? or does it? it just shows the signal strength of the network you are connected too?
2005-06-08T14:00:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	hmm, maybe.  I don't wander too much, so I'm not sure
2005-06-08T14:01:00.000Z	Fanskapet	b2s	hmm you know what file to edit to get your mounted partitions to get them appear in the gnome "Computer" window ?
2005-06-08T14:02:00.000Z	b2s	Fanskapet	no, I don't know, I've wondered that though ;)
