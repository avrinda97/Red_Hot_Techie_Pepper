2006-09-25T07:55:00.000Z	screechingcat		ive deleted my /opt/firefox
2006-09-25T07:55:00.000Z	screechingcat		can i get it bak anyway ?
2006-09-25T07:56:00.000Z	screechingcat		reinstalling firefox dosent help
2006-09-25T07:56:00.000Z	screechingcat		it it says "Details: Failed to execute child process "firefox" (No such file or directory)"
2006-09-25T07:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	no, /opt/firefox is not where the default package places firefox. do you instaled it from firefox website?
2006-09-25T07:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	you are someone else instaled firefox from the website following wiki intruccions (maybe you instaled ff 1.5 in hoary)
2006-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	i know it becouse i did the same but when i upgrade to dapper i erased the hand made install and used the oficial packages
2006-09-25T08:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	or maybe you installed ff 2 beta in dapper
2006-09-25T08:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	follow the wiki intructions to take your system back to normal
2006-09-25T08:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	as part of the manual install process you renamed ff binaries to ff.ubuntu you need to mrename them again to the original names
2006-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	for the second time: go to the wiki (the same page you used to install it) and follow intructions there
2006-09-25T08:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	then you are on your own i do not know what the script did or how... (take it as a warning of not blindly use scripts)
2006-09-25T08:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	undo the last 6 lines of the script
2006-09-25T08:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	no undo them for example sudo dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/firefox.ubuntu --rename /usr/bin/firefox will become sudo dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/firefox --rename /usr/bin/firefox.ubuntu
2006-09-25T08:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	or you will have to delete /usr/bin/firefox (make sure you delete the link pointing to /opt/.... not the actual binary.)
2006-09-25T08:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	go to the wiki page there you will find how to undo the comands the script uses (they are taken from there)
2006-09-25T08:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	screechingcat	no problem
