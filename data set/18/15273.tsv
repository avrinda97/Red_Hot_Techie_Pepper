2005-04-27T10:26:00.000Z	cycom		Until Ubuntu, I hated gnome.
2005-04-27T10:26:00.000Z	cycom		now I love it.
2005-04-27T10:28:00.000Z	cycom		I use gentoo for all my stuff except my laptop
2005-04-27T10:30:00.000Z	cycom		wuss.
2005-04-27T10:30:00.000Z	cycom		in any case, they're starting to move away from stage 1 and 2 so that stage 3 is the only way to go, since 1 and 2 are causing problems like circular deps and things (or so I've heard)
2005-04-27T10:31:00.000Z	cycom		emerge -u world is nice
2005-04-27T10:31:00.000Z	cycom		but Ubuntu is still the fast/easy/complete way to go on my laptop
2005-04-27T10:32:00.000Z	cycom		I hope 2.6.10 supports my GPS. 2.6.11 had the modules for it marked (NEW)
2005-04-27T10:33:00.000Z	cycom		sunava bitch. it's only suported in 2.6.11
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	markuman	cycom	what is emerge -u
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	markuman		?
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	cycom		emerge --update
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	cycom		it's updates out of date packages
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	cycom		or you can do emerge -eu world
2005-04-27T10:35:00.000Z	cycom		which will recompile EVERYTHING
2005-04-27T10:36:00.000Z	markuman		but how to make .deb packages from source? is it prossible with apt-build ?
2005-04-27T10:36:00.000Z	cycom		oh well, time for DistCC!
2005-04-27T10:37:00.000Z	cycom	markuman	not sure.  I never used debian for more than an hour, before replacing it.  Ubuntu is the first debian-based thing that I've liked.
