2005-10-31T06:18:00.000Z	gutsohn		?? Removing any system startup links for /etc/init.d/startup ...
2005-10-31T06:19:00.000Z	gutsohn		was this bad?
2005-10-31T06:19:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 depends..... what was the service exactly?
2005-10-31T06:22:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	i wanted to remove startup.sh (from all folders) to put it in a higher one
2005-10-31T06:22:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	but then i wrote only startup instead of startup.sh
2005-10-31T06:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 a script you made by yourself?
2005-10-31T06:25:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	yes! startup.sh - but i wrote startup
2005-10-31T06:25:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 its no problem.. the /etc/rcN.d links dont keep the .sh extension  you can recreate it with higher numbers to make it run later.
2005-10-31T06:26:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 dont worry ;)
2005-10-31T06:26:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	great! - thank you
2005-10-31T06:27:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	but normally then there is a list from which rcN.d folders the programm is removed...
2005-10-31T06:29:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	do you think nothing happend? because startup.sh is still in the rcN.d-folders
2005-10-31T06:30:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 do you have a  "startup" in /etc/init.d/ ?
2005-10-31T06:31:00.000Z	aftertaf	gutsohn	 did it say where it removed from once it said, removing system scripts.... ?
2005-10-31T06:32:00.000Z	gutsohn	aftertaf	i haven't a startup in /etc/init.d only a startup.sh - there is only standing:
