2005-12-09T12:47:00.000Z	poningru		anyone know how to make my wireless card from ra0 to eth1?
2005-12-09T12:47:00.000Z	poningru		cause wifi-radar will not check ra0
2005-12-09T12:48:00.000Z	poningru		ok thanks dude
2005-12-09T12:48:00.000Z	poningru		perhaps I should make it /dev/wlan0
2005-12-09T12:48:00.000Z	poningru		ok thanks dude
2005-12-09T12:49:00.000Z	poningru		the symlink I mean
2005-12-09T12:50:00.000Z	poningru		hmm ok thanks dude
2005-12-09T12:50:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	have you looked at the /etc/iftab file?
2005-12-09T12:51:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	there you can change the mapping of eth or whatever to point to a specific MAC address
2005-12-09T12:52:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	only reason I know that works is because I changed my wireless from eth1 to eth0 there
2005-12-09T12:55:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	don't restart
2005-12-09T12:55:00.000Z	poningru	rabeldable	then?
2005-12-09T12:56:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	you need to change a few things first
2005-12-09T12:56:00.000Z	poningru	rabeldable	listening
2005-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	you could change the ip information in the /etc/network/interfaces file then do an ifdown and ifup to "disable and enable" the interface
2005-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	poningru	rabeldable	hmm let me try
2005-12-09T12:58:00.000Z	rabeldable	poningru	or you could reboot, but the system will not be on the net yet you need to modify the network properties for the interfaces still
2005-12-09T13:00:00.000Z	poningru	rabeldable	ok thanks dude
