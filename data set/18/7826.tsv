2007-12-06T01:55:00.000Z	kazil		yeah i tried it also but zend is much more for my taste :)
2007-12-06T01:55:00.000Z	mavi-		ok
2007-12-06T01:56:00.000Z	mavi-	kazil	you will have to disable 3d-effects every time you want to run zend tho
2007-12-06T01:56:00.000Z	kazil		also i used zend for almost 2 years now... so i`m kinda use to it :)
2007-12-06T01:56:00.000Z	mavi-	kazil	or maybe there are some compiz-patch for that if you are in the mood for fixing it.
2007-12-06T02:02:00.000Z	kazil	mavi-	there`s some zend plugin for eclipse in beta available on zend.com. u tried it?
