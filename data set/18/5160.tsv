2008-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire		Hi
2008-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire		I have a problem with NVIDIA GeForce 6100 on Ubuntu 64
2008-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire		Ubuntu 8.10 of course
2008-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	please state the problem, thoroughly
2008-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	preferably all on one singleline
2008-12-22T15:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	i can't help much, but start by pasting your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file into a pastebin. then state your problem just like you did above(use the up arrow to recall your message), and include the url to the pastebin in your message
2008-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	also, in case you don't know, you can go here to try and change your resolution...  System --> Preferences --> Screen Resolution
2008-12-22T15:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	ok, add that to your original message saying... and here is my pastebin
2008-12-22T15:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	i shold have said.. add that to your original message saying... and here is my xorg.conf file
2008-12-22T15:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	ok, interesting. that's an empty xorg.conf file. it doesn't seem to me that it should be empty of you ran... dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-12-22T15:12:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire	onetinsoldier	I'll install the 177 driver then I'll paste the new changes of my xorg.conf ;)
2008-12-22T15:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	i have instructions on how to make a full xorg.conf file. but it's not using the dpkg-reconfigure command, and it requires several steps
2008-12-22T15:13:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire	onetinsoldier	don't worry I'll try to build my own xorg.conf manually I'll see what's the result ;) thank you very much for your help ;)
2008-12-22T15:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	ok, good luck
2008-12-22T15:47:00.000Z	ButterflyOfFire	onetinsoldier	problem of my Grpahic Card solved. I installed the driver from the NVIDIA website and modified the resolution in xorg.conf in the SubSection "Display". Compiz Works ! The only problem I have now is the decorations of the applications :p
2008-12-22T15:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	allright! that's dounds very good, except i don't know what the problem with your windows decorations is. and really, i haven't done anything for you, you solved the problem yourself.
2008-12-22T16:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	welcome back :-)
2008-12-22T16:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ButterflyOfFire	i know the feeling :-)
