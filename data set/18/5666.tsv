2012-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	MrMist1		What's the best way of running "cron-like" tasks in ubuntu? I know how to set up Cron, but it doesn't seem like it's being used bu default by the system
2012-02-12T15:29:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	it is used by default
2012-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	so how come crontab -l doesn't reveal anything when running as root?
2012-02-12T15:30:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	that what's /etc/crontab for
2012-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	Hmm... i thought I was supposed to run crontab -e to edit crontab?
2012-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	since root-account is disabled in *buntu, it makes no sense
2012-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	as user, "crontab -e" works fine
2012-02-12T15:31:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	It's not disabled?? sudo su root
2012-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	no recommended and not supported here
2012-02-12T15:32:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	if you need a root-shell, use "sudo -i"
2012-02-12T15:36:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	sudo -i? Never used that one... care to explain the difference?
2012-02-12T15:37:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	read "man sudo"
2012-02-12T15:37:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	it just makes sure you get a proper env similar to a root-login shell
2012-02-12T15:39:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	Chipzzz: Ah... thanks. But back to the cron question.. I start by creating a crontab as a user? Say I'd like to run a task every 10 minutes..
2012-02-12T15:39:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	crontab -e
2012-02-12T15:40:00.000Z	llutz	MrMist1	as "user"
2012-02-12T15:41:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	but it's a server doing something like dyndns... do I create a user for just this task?
2012-02-12T15:41:00.000Z	MrMist1	llutz	doesn't seem right running this task as my regular user
