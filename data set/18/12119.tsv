2006-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	miranda82		does anyone know how to make smaller the panel where i got the ubuntu menu? i can't make it smaller than 24px...
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	that's about as small as it gets, ubfortunately
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	no way to make it smaller? it's way too big...
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	not that I know of
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	don't know why they've done that...
2006-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	you can make the panel "autohide"
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	that is not what i want, i want to see it
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	I understand - but gnome won't do it as far as I know
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	u think it coudl be cause of the ubuntu logo?
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	I've tried too
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	it is the logo..
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	:D
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	no, it's a gnome thing
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	not an ubuntu thing
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	 ?
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	choose to not show icons on menus
2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	miranda82	ah, OK - not many people would like that I guess
2006-05-27T16:40:00.000Z	miranda82	thoreauputic	yeah i know, but it s a solution, i guess resizing that icon would made the trick
