2006-06-27T07:42:00.000Z	burepe2	Cas	Lynoure I can see the windows comp in that location, but from the windows comp when I enter the ubuntu comp's address (\\pikapika\) it asks me for a password and username
2006-06-27T07:42:00.000Z	Cas	burepe2	you'll need to edit smb.conf if you want anonymous access
