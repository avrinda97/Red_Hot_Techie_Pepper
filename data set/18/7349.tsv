2009-02-11T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	could set them in ~/.bashrc
2009-02-11T19:13:00.000Z	humbolt	ActionParsnip	Know that. But these things should be taken care of by some install or update script, shouldn't they?
2009-02-11T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	i guess they could, im just used to editting conf files so I wouldnt know
2009-02-11T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	ou could spend hours ttrying to find a gui to do something you already know how to do in a conf file

2009-08-13T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	dead useful site
2009-08-13T16:57:00.000Z	humbolt	ActionParsnip	seems like it is just down for me. But why. Everything else is working and DNS does resolve correctly.
2009-08-13T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	maybe your provider isplaying with their wires

2009-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	there is no recommended anything
2009-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	there are options, just try a few see which you like
2009-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	humbolt	ActionParsnip	keep it simple, what makes the most sense?
2009-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	all
2009-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	vmware, virtualbox and qemu all are good
2009-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	humbolt	ActionParsnip	As Xen is paravitualized, it might make the most sense for linux on linux?!
2009-08-25T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	humbolt	all are fine, if you think that is better then go for it
