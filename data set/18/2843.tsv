2011-04-10T13:27:00.000Z	Neo_		hi all, just a little advice; if i wanted to write a graphical application what graphic library would you suggest me?
2011-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	one that does graphics
2011-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	well, it's obvious; but what is it better between GTK or QT or something else?
2011-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	flip a coin
2011-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	if dependencies don't matter then you might as well
2011-04-10T13:30:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	so you think they are completely interchangeble?
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	as you asked, anything is an acceptable suggestion
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	you provided 2, so flip a coin if you can't think of any other reason you would pick between them
2011-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	ok, thanks
2011-04-30T01:05:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	well, you should have looked at your other options before building it yourself; for example, the xorg-edgers ppa already builds it almost daily, and it installs it in the right place / works; so if you can clean up the mess, try the ppa
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	ok thanks, then i'll try to install it in the default directory
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	ehh, just use the ppa
2011-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	theres another ppa they run that just has stable driver updates in it as well
2011-04-30T01:08:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	my purpose was to install ubuntu natty graphics driver(mesa too) to ubuntu 10.10
2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	that's because i noticed that thoose drivers works better than theese
2011-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	then you add the sources and use package pinning; but it is still somethingn you don't want to do, there were 2 xorg abi updates that natty rolled in iirc
2011-04-30T01:10:00.000Z	ohsix	Neo_	unfortunately due to changes in natty the ppa stopped doing daily builds for maverick and older some time ago; otherwise you could just use it for updated drivers for mav as well
2011-04-30T01:11:00.000Z	Neo_	ohsix	ok i'll try it; thanks
