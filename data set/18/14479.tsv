2006-11-05T10:35:00.000Z	variant	iami89	i already told you one

2006-11-06T10:37:00.000Z	variant	iami89	reboot to the dapper live cd and just install over the existing installation, making sure format is selected for the / parttion
2006-11-06T10:38:00.000Z	variant	iami89	fix bios
2006-11-06T10:38:00.000Z	variant	iami89	add the cd as the first bootable device
2006-11-06T10:39:00.000Z	variant	iami89	well then it should boot, having ubuntu isntalled will not affect the way the bios works
2006-11-06T10:41:00.000Z	variant	iami89	the cd is busted?
2006-11-06T10:41:00.000Z	variant	iami89	try the one you used to isntall with
2006-11-06T10:42:00.000Z	variant	iami89	does it boot witht he cd that you used to isntall with?
2006-11-06T10:42:00.000Z	variant	iami89	then the cd you have is bust
