2007-01-12T11:21:00.000Z	cappiz		is it possible to have a kind of encryption, which allows the home folder to be mounted on login... several users on same dev
2007-01-12T11:21:00.000Z	cappiz		?
2007-01-12T11:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	you can have encrypted file systems .. and have /home encrypted ..sure
2007-01-12T11:23:00.000Z	cappiz	un_operateur	but will it be mounted when a user logs in
2007-01-12T11:23:00.000Z	cappiz		?
2007-01-12T11:24:00.000Z	cappiz		i want the home folders to only be mounted when they are logged in.
2007-01-12T11:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	if you have an entry for the filesystem in /etc/fstab .. it will be mounted when the computer is started up before any of the users log on
2007-01-12T11:24:00.000Z	cappiz	un_operateur	thats not what i want ;D
2007-01-12T11:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	ok and why not?
2007-01-12T11:25:00.000Z	cappiz		i only want the home folders to be mounted when they are logged in on the system
2007-01-12T11:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	well, errm, if it's a desktop -- you start a system to log on to it and use it right -- whats wrong with having a disk mounted before the user logs on .. it saves some hassle
2007-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	cappiz		yeah wel... im paranoid :P
2007-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	normal users cannot normally mount disks (atleast not so that they can be shared and used by multiple users) .. and if the filesystem is encrypted, you have nothing to worry about ..err, why else would you encrypt a file system?
2007-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	cappiz		but can different users use the same encrypted device?
2007-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	cappiz		like /home/cappiz /home/un_operateur
2007-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	yes, if it is mounted by root via /etc/fstab .. not otherwise
2007-01-12T11:29:00.000Z	cappiz		if both those folders is located at the same device... they wil both get mounted at the same time?
2007-01-12T11:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	cappiz	it's not the folders that will be mounted .. rather the disk that they reside on .. and since a device can only be mounted at once, it will happen "at the same time" :)
