2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	pettern		do anyone else have problems with opera after the flashplugin got updated?
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	haxality	pettern	yes
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	haxality	pettern	I was actually just about to ask about that
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	pettern	haxality	found any solution?
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	haxality		unfortunately no
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	haxality		:(
2006-12-04T10:59:00.000Z	haxality		I've been having all kinds of problems with the flash player plugin, in general
2006-12-04T11:00:00.000Z	pettern		guess i can redirecs the swf files to some other app, but thats not really a solution
2006-12-04T11:00:00.000Z	haxality		does anyone know if the linux flash player is better than the macromedia one in terms of actually working?
2006-12-04T11:00:00.000Z	haxality		I don't really care about features, as long as it plays stuff
2006-12-04T11:00:00.000Z	pettern	haxality	i think i used that one before and it sucks
2006-12-04T11:01:00.000Z	haxality		dang
2006-12-04T11:01:00.000Z	haxality		oh well, gota give it time then
2006-12-04T11:01:00.000Z	pettern	haxality	do you know if there is any way to get the        old flash version trough apt?
2006-12-04T11:02:00.000Z	haxality	pettern	I don't think you can, I think you'd have to find the installer binary somewhere and download it
2006-12-04T11:02:00.000Z	haxality	pettern	I think we're having different problems though
2006-12-04T11:02:00.000Z	haxality	pettern	I have trouble in general with the current version of the flash plugin, be it in firefox or opera
2006-12-04T11:03:00.000Z	pettern	haxality	what kind of errors do you get if you run it in terminal?
