2008-11-30T05:47:00.000Z	mrwes		Is there anyway to save login information when using openssh-server, or do I have to type the server name in everytime I connect?
2008-11-30T05:48:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	to avoid typing in the server name, look in man ssh_config
2008-11-30T05:48:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	Ok
2008-11-30T05:49:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	you'd make a host block named with a shortcut name, then set HostName to the actual name
2008-11-30T05:50:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	and if you need to save passwords too, look up ssh-keygen as Yahovah said
2008-11-30T05:56:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	with an ssh alias in the config file, it's better to have a static IP ?
2008-11-30T05:57:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	not sure what you mean. Can you rephrase the question?
2008-11-30T05:58:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	Ok...I setup my ~/.ssh/config file with my desktop, but if I'm using DHCP won't the IP change..potentially
2008-11-30T05:59:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	what Yahovah said, or set up a dynamic DNS thingie like DynDNS
2008-11-30T05:59:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	(I forget the technical term for them...)
2008-11-30T06:40:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	indeed it does :) ssh + screen + irssi = i can stay connected to IRC when I leave for work, and pick up where I was when I get there :D
2008-11-30T06:40:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	I remember using screen when I was running slackware
2008-11-30T06:41:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	I remember getting lost on which screen I was actually on..heh
2009-01-02T21:45:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	there's a plugin for it. Open the Plugins window and look for Hide Joins/Parts or something like that.
2009-01-02T21:45:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	lemme look
2009-01-02T21:46:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	found it -- thanks! that was killin' me
2009-05-30T05:52:00.000Z	mrwes	rww	ok -a too :)
2010-04-17T05:14:00.000Z	rww	mrwes	that link errors out
