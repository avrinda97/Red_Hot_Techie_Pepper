2006-11-08T12:10:00.000Z	shrndegruv		and 100 mb to boot
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	shrndegruv		40 mb should be enough for /boot right?
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	shrndegruv		crap
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	shrndegruv		serious stuff
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	for how many OSes?
2006-11-08T12:12:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	uhh, then why the heck are you making a /boot partition??
2006-11-08T12:13:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	but ---why--- do you think you need a /boot partition
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	I'm just going to go ahead and tell you right now, that you don't need a /boot partition.  PLUS, since you're limited on space, I don't even recommend splitting up into / and /home.
2006-11-08T12:21:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	it makes it much easier to wipe out, reinstall etc your OS, BUT you have such little space, that I recommend sharing that 20gigs.
2006-11-08T12:22:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	20gigs is what I have for linux on this laptop, and that's how I have it.   If I separated them, I risk running out of one or the other's space
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	"naming them"?
2006-11-08T12:43:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	shrndegruv	see if it succeeds
