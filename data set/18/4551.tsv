2011-04-08T04:57:00.000Z	superlou		Has anyone ever had there harddisk fill to 100% by itself?  Stuck in command line now since don't have enough free space to startx.  Waiting for a "du -sk * | sort -rn" to finish.  Open to any tips :)
2011-04-08T04:59:00.000Z	superlou		hmm
2011-04-08T04:59:00.000Z	superlou		du says my /media is very large
2011-04-08T05:00:00.000Z	superlou		93G.  Son of a gun.  My home is 31G and it's a 140G drive.   Sounds like the bad guys in media.
2011-04-08T05:00:00.000Z	superlou		Though i thought media was symbolic links to other stuff
2011-04-08T05:01:00.000Z	superlou		nope, just ubuntu
2011-04-08T05:01:00.000Z	superlou		it looks like media is full of Backups from simplebackup
2011-04-08T05:02:00.000Z	superlou		oy.  I had simple backup configured to backup to a raid array automatically
2011-04-08T05:02:00.000Z	superlou		but the raid doesn't start automatically in ubuntu for some reason
2011-04-08T05:02:00.000Z	superlou		so it looks like whenever i haven't given ubuntu credentials to assemble root, backups are going in there
2011-04-08T05:04:00.000Z	meganerd	superlou	how did you build the RAID array?
2011-04-08T05:04:00.000Z	superlou	meganerd	mdadm
2011-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	superlou	meganerd	nice.  For some reason mine show up in computer and when i double click the raid icon, it prompts for admin password
2011-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	meganerd	superlou	sounds like permissions, before you click on the array in computer, does it show as mounted with a "df -h" at the command line?
2011-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	superlou	meganerd	nope
2011-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	meganerd	superlou	cat /proc/mdstat
2011-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	superlou	meganerd	will do .  Restarting.  Got down to 92% by removing a backup.  Hopefully can boot to GUI now
2011-04-08T05:34:00.000Z	superlou	meganerd	no big info in the logs.  There's a mdadm[1812]: NewArray event detected on md device /dev/md0 every now and then
