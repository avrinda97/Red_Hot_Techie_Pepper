2008-02-29T06:42:00.000Z	LimCore		wow this !virus entry is faulty
2008-02-29T06:42:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	why do you say that?
2008-02-29T06:43:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	there are TONS of troyans, worms, rootkits etc targetet at linux.  such fanboi articles do not help by false sense of security
2008-02-29T06:44:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	the article is only about VIRUSES. please don't confuse viruses with other malware
2008-02-29T06:44:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	users confuse it.  No viruses (omg omg)  ....but rootkits etc.
2008-02-29T06:45:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	so we agree the article is not faulty
2008-02-29T06:45:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	it's just possible to misinterpret... as other texts
2008-02-29T06:45:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	worms, viruses, same thing for end user
2008-02-29T06:46:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	no.
2008-02-29T06:46:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	I got my files deleted by a virus :((((   No... WAIT! it was a WORM not a virus! pheeeew!
2008-02-29T06:47:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	worms don't do that, get your facts straight
2008-02-29T06:47:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	some do, why not? or cause other damage
2008-02-29T06:48:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	either you, or wikipedia article on Worms, is mistaken. I guess that you
2008-02-29T06:48:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	yes, but does worms magically become viruses? no?
2008-02-29T06:49:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	both viruses and worms can destroy user files; or do other damage. linux may be quite secure from viruses, but not so much from worms, which that fanboy style article forgotten to mentioned
2008-02-29T06:51:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	power shortages may also damage your computer. so does your brother, or a corrupted hard drive or static electrical charges. they are not !viruses anyway.
2008-02-29T06:52:00.000Z	LimCore	magnetron	most users mistake viruses for worms.  most users do NOT mistake viruses for brother
2008-02-29T06:53:00.000Z	magnetron	LimCore	you have apparently not met my brother
