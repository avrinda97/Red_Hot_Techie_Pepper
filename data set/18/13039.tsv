2007-12-27T06:43:00.000Z	Cereal		My Firefox occasionally opens 80+ tabs due too something beyond me. Does anyone know what causes this and how I can fix it? my etc/apt/sources.list : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49644/

2007-12-27T06:47:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: Checking..
2007-12-27T06:48:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: Why is Automatix so bad?
2007-12-27T06:48:00.000Z	Cereal		WOls: Thanks :)
2007-12-27T06:49:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: I can remove the Repos it added from inside itself. Should I?
2007-12-27T06:50:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: Great :)
2007-12-27T06:51:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: Done. Anything else I can do? Would "sudo apt-get remove automatix" remove it?
2007-12-27T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Cereal	 that may remove the program. but wont undo the damage its done.
2007-12-27T06:52:00.000Z	Cereal	Dr_willis_	Okay. Is there ANY way I can restore it?
2007-12-27T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Cereal	 no idea. I know better then to use AUtomatix. :)
2007-12-27T06:53:00.000Z	Cereal	Dr_willis_	I didn't :/
2007-12-27T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Cereal	 there is/was an #automatix channel and thei web site/forums
2007-12-27T06:54:00.000Z	Cereal	Dr_willis_	Thanks :) I now understand that it's bad. But why is it bad? What bad stuff does it perform?
2007-12-27T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		installs all kinds of things in bad ways  with littl eerror checking, and with the release of gutsy.. lets just say that automatix really is not needed these days
2007-12-27T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Cereal	 it never was really needed.
2007-12-27T06:56:00.000Z	Cereal		Wols: damn :/ So the easiest really would be to reinstall?
2007-12-27T06:56:00.000Z	Cereal	Dr_willis_	I can see that :/
