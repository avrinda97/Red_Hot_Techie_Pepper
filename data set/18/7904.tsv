2008-05-26T21:27:00.000Z	astro76	dolphin_noel	can you clarify what you mean, ntfs is a windows filesystem, pal and NTSC are television standards
2008-05-26T21:27:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	astro76	yes ntsc sorry
2008-05-26T21:29:00.000Z	astro76	dolphin_noel	such a setting I would imagine would only apply to TV out, and it depends on what country you live as to what standard your TV is
2008-05-26T21:29:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	astro76	so the bios configuration to pal or ntsc dont have nathing to do whith refresh rate ... in xorg.conf ?!
2008-05-26T21:30:00.000Z	astro76	dolphin_noel	correct, should be for tv out only
2008-05-26T21:31:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	astro76	yes but in the bios it talks about the display ... you shure about that?!
