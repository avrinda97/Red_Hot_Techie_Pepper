2012-11-24T21:48:00.000Z	dr_willis		i dont see any chromium named dir. :) but i did get an error when i ran chromoim due to  not setting up all your commands first
2012-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		!text
2012-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	does --single still work though?
2012-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 i always use the text mode option, i think 'single' does work.
2012-11-24T22:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 check out openelec if you want a MultiMedia distro  its basically a mini xmbmcubuntu type setup
2012-11-24T22:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 grub  can be set to use differnt modes.. some monitors just dont like some of the res/modes that grub can use.
2012-11-24T22:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 lspci should show.   lspci | grep VGA (or grep vga)
2012-11-24T22:20:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	it shows the graphics card correctly
2012-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 id hope lspci shows the card correctly. ;) the issue is if the drivers work correctly with the card..
2012-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	it shows the graphics card correctly
2012-11-24T22:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 if you are using xbmcbuntu  i would suggest trying an actual ubuntu install and installing xbmc. it may work better
2012-11-24T22:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 technically this channel does NOT support xbmcbuntu ;)  and last i used xbmcvbuntu - it was not as up to date as ubuntu in some areas
2012-11-24T22:27:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	true but I'm not having trouble with the xbmc part but the underlying stuff like grub and everything and you all helped well and I got the ubuntu part running now I'm looking for graphics driers which again I think is part of ubuntu...
2012-11-24T22:27:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	I could of course switch to nvidia support now
2012-11-24T22:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 if  You really need a live xbmc setup try openelec --> http://openelec.tv/
2012-11-24T22:29:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	I worked with openelec on a rapsberry pi and was disappointed with the lack of some stuff and thought maybe xbmcbuntu was better
2012-11-24T22:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hans_Zero	 given the specs of the Pi. ;) that fact it worked decently well is amazeing.. but my Pis are on backorder.
2012-11-24T22:30:00.000Z	Hans_Zero	dr_willis	I think the new version with even more ram should work even better
