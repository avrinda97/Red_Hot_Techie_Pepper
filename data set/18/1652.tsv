2010-12-31T09:17:00.000Z	comulent		i'm completely new to linux, i'm afraid....
2010-12-31T09:18:00.000Z	comulent		haha awesome. ctrl alt T wins!
2010-12-31T09:20:00.000Z	comulent		not seeing it under lspci or lsusb....
2010-12-31T09:20:00.000Z	comulent		this means i need to find the driver for the device, right?
2010-12-31T09:21:00.000Z	pksadiq	comulent	I had to disconnect the device first time and reconnect to get the bt recognized
2010-12-31T09:22:00.000Z	pksadiq	comulent	try to remove and connect again
2010-12-31T09:22:00.000Z	comulent	pksadiq	it's in the laptop.... like physically inside it,,., can't uplug it
2010-12-31T09:23:00.000Z	pksadiq	comulent	k, sorry
2010-12-31T10:23:00.000Z	pksadiq	comulent	did you delete something from panel?
2010-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	comulent	pksadiq	yep. removed the link to firefox after i installed chrome
2010-12-31T10:27:00.000Z	pksadiq	comulent	I think you did something wrong, if nothing is shown in the pannel, you can add it manually by right clicking > add to panel > select notification area,   and something like that
2010-12-31T10:28:00.000Z	comulent	pksadiq	!panel | cromulent gives me an error message. bash !panel: event not found
