2006-10-14T16:48:00.000Z	davvs		aah, ok thanks thirdalbum
2006-10-14T14:08:00.000Z	davvs		is there any way to move the cursor position from the commandline?
2006-10-14T14:09:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	use the arrow keys
2006-10-14T14:09:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	how?
2006-10-14T14:09:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	i mean move the mousecursor :P
2006-10-14T14:09:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	use the mouse?
2006-10-14T14:10:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	why do you need to move it?
2006-10-14T14:10:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	 i need to move it to another dispaly which is 5000 pixels to the right, i cant move it to that display just by moving the mouse, i need to send it to some coodrinates
2006-10-14T14:13:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	i dont know any cursor commands but couldnt you just boost the mouse speed loads and move it normally?
2006-10-14T14:13:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	yea i guess that would work but... :P
2006-10-14T14:20:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	 could you get it set so u could only trave l through a corner rather than a side
2006-10-14T14:23:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	yes i can, but if i do, i might accedently go into that corner :P
2006-10-14T14:26:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	could you run a seperate x server on it then use mplayer and pipe commands to it by running it from a term on your main desktop
2006-10-14T14:26:00.000Z	davvs	HumanPrototype	how do i pipe commands between mplayer(s)?
2006-10-14T14:26:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	i dont think you would need to
2006-10-14T14:28:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	im just testing something but i think you can run mplayer from a console on a second x server (on the second tv) and control it in that term
2006-10-14T14:29:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	davvs	run mplayer in the term and it tells you what it will do
