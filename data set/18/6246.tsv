2008-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	_Brun0_		hi all. what's the correct way to auto mount an NTFS partition on ubuntu 8.04?
2008-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	Create a mount point and edit your fstab
2008-06-06T19:32:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	i did that. but the icon doesn't show in dekstop. before i was mounting "manually" by clicking on the partition name on the menu "Places" and then it shoewed in dekstop
2008-06-06T19:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	sudo mkdir /media/ntfs-music  or whatever
2008-06-06T19:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	What ntfs partition are you trying to mount.. sda1 or what    sduo fdisk -l   to see them all
2008-06-06T19:34:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	ok let me try one more. brb
2008-06-07T00:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	UK or us keyboard
2008-06-07T00:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	does shift 3 give you #
2008-06-07T00:48:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	Yes #
2008-06-07T00:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	aWhat does that key actually show on your keyboard
2008-06-07T00:49:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	you mean the question mark?
2008-06-07T00:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	What keys are not right when you press them
2008-06-07T00:51:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	all keys are right. I just cannot do question mark because it is a bit different from common keyboards. In my laptop the question mark is done by combination of CTRL+ALT+W  or  FN+F1
2008-06-07T00:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	Odd but ok, you might consider remapping a key you seldom use so it becomes a ?
2008-06-07T00:54:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	i'll try that since other suggestions were to install acerhk module which didn't compiled here =(
2008-06-07T00:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_Brun0_	I'll poke around to see if I can figure it out while you read up
2008-06-07T00:55:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	ty very much
2008-06-07T01:01:00.000Z	_Brun0_	Jack_Sparrow	brb
