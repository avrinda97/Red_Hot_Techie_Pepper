2008-09-02T12:37:00.000Z	alpha232		is there a way to re-install without overwriting the current configs?
2008-09-02T12:38:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	reinstall what?
2008-09-02T12:39:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	ubuntu....
2008-09-02T12:39:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	i need to move from 6.10 to 6.06 so i can goto 8.10
2008-09-02T12:40:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	downgrades are not supported either
2008-09-02T12:41:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	 so is there a way to install from a cd as a repo but not overwrite the configs?
2008-09-02T12:41:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	can't you just make a backup of your config files .. install 8.04 and pull in the config files from your backup set as and when needed?
2008-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	you can use a CD as a repo yes .. but you need the alternate CD or ISO for that  -- but that still doesn't address how you are going to get to 8.04 the supported way.
2008-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	server iso :)
2008-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	i am just disappointed that it is this difficult
2008-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	if you are thinking of downgrading from 6.10 to 6.06 - not a good idea
2008-09-02T12:43:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	only enough to jump up to the latest
2008-09-02T12:44:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	it's just stupid i can't upgrade straight to the current LTS
2008-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	why don't you download the alternate ISOs for 7.04 and 7.10 etc .. use the 7.04 ISO to upgrade to 7.04, then use the next ISO to get to 7.10 and so on
2008-09-02T12:45:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	because it would take forever
2008-09-02T12:46:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	indeed -- but it's a safe way
2008-09-02T12:48:00.000Z	unop	alpha232	mind if i PM ?
2008-09-02T12:48:00.000Z	alpha232	unop	i suppose
