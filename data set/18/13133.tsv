2006-01-07T13:43:00.000Z	polpak	PeteyPablo	depends on what you want to run

2006-01-07T13:51:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	thanks
2006-01-07T13:53:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	i updated. to ff 1.5 it works perfectly for me but i hear alot of people have problems
2006-01-07T13:55:00.000Z	polpak	PeteyPablo	I believe one comes with ubuntu, but most ppl I know of prefer bittornado (sp?)
2006-01-07T13:56:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	yea.
2006-01-07T14:10:00.000Z	polpak	PeteyPablo	I've used FreeBSD and linux for enterprise level servers.. I prefer Linux
2006-01-07T14:10:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	really? i have a shell account to a high speed FreeBSD server it seems to be very godo
2006-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	polpak	PeteyPablo	it's pretty good.. But stuff you'd normally take for granted (SMP kernels etc) have to be specially configured etc
2006-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	i see
2006-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	do you know about that load balancer thing that is available? i want to run freebsd on some older pcs with that program so it will be somewhat fast ;-P
2006-01-07T14:13:00.000Z	polpak	PeteyPablo	you mean clustering? The only load balancing I have any experience with is ServerIrons.. And those are not really what you'd be looking for (about 100k USD)
2006-01-07T14:13:00.000Z	PeteyPablo	polpak	it's some open source thing
