2006-03-10T07:59:00.000Z	dhanny		what 9999 port is?
2006-03-10T08:00:00.000Z	dhanny		ok.. just a minute.. i'm goin to install apt-proxy
2006-03-10T08:02:00.000Z	dhanny		whoaaaaaa.... i got error.. there is no apt-proxy in dapper's repo... E: Package apt-proxy has no installation candidate
2006-03-10T08:03:00.000Z	dhanny		ok..
2006-03-10T08:04:00.000Z	dhanny		btw, why there is no how to in ubuntu wiki about mirorring its repo?????????
2006-03-10T08:04:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	uh... i guess it's not something people do too often ;)
2006-03-10T08:04:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	anyway, "apt-cache show apt-proxy" and "apt-cache show apt-move"
2006-03-10T08:06:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	hm, it explains that in the description
2006-03-10T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	uh, if you want a full mirror, just run wget
2006-03-10T08:10:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	"wget --mirror http://ubuntu.cbn.net.id" i guess. haven't tried yet, just reading the man page
2006-03-10T08:11:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	it appears to be working here
2006-03-10T08:12:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	anyway, do you have an idea how big the ubuntu reps can be?
2006-03-10T08:13:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	i don't know either, but it will be in the order of tens/hundreds of gigabytes
2006-03-10T08:14:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	as stormx2 said, it depends on what you mean by "dapper". mirroring the dapper repository would certainly result in tens/hundreds gigs
2006-03-10T08:14:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	on the other hand, mirroring the contents of just the CD-ROM wouldn't. but then, why mirror that when you have the CD-ROM? =)
2006-03-10T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	if you have so little bandwidth, i really don't see how you could have a chance of mirroring even just the main repository! :\
2006-03-10T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	but what's the problem anyway, you've got more than one computer with ubuntu?
2006-03-10T08:27:00.000Z	LjL	dhanny	basically when you install a package on your client *or* on your server, apt-cache will cache it, so that if you later install the same package on the other machine, it won't have to be downloaded
