2009-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	I knew that answer to that...  hang on
2009-06-06T06:16:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	I'll brb. Restarting xchat.
2009-06-06T06:17:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	I'm back.
2009-06-06T06:17:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	looking now.  it's been a while..
2009-06-06T06:19:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	there is Application Switcher and Static Application Switcher.  You want the latter.
2009-06-06T06:20:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	that's still a switcher. I want no switcher. I don't need any distracting visual feedback for alt-tabbing - I know that I'm alt-tabbing.
2009-06-06T06:21:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	yeah..  click it and look at the bottom under Bindings
2009-06-06T06:23:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	- sorry? What?
2009-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	when you click Static Application Switcher, it will bring up a list..  in that list are the bindings for that setting.  You can enable the bottom ones that say "No popup"
2009-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	where do I set that?
2009-06-06T06:24:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	I'm using simple-ccsm. I'm guessing you're using something else?
2009-06-06T06:28:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	where do I get ccsm?
2009-06-06T06:28:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	compizconfig-settings-manager  it was a dependency of simple-ccsm..
2009-06-06T06:29:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	but how do I launch it?
2009-06-06T06:29:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	by running ccsm
2009-06-06T06:32:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	ok, so I got ccsm running. That's... a lot. What do I do now?
2009-06-06T06:32:00.000Z	Qwell	elad	look for static application switcher, then follow what I said
2009-06-06T06:32:00.000Z	elad	Qwell	I found it, and I got it checkboxed. But what now?
