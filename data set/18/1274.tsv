2011-04-15T13:50:00.000Z	Sverd		hi, I have a strange problem, I was wondering if anyone might have any ideas. Im running ubuntu server 10.10 and if I use bash I cant type lower case e in console. Only way around was changing from bash to bin/sh.. but in sh I cant use the lowercase e in programs like lftp.
2011-04-15T13:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	what do you get instead of an e ?
2011-04-15T13:51:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	nothing, just a error message from putty.. like im trying to paste a blank cliboard
2011-04-15T13:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	so this happens on putty. not in a xterminal nor the console tty's. looks like a putty conffiguration issue
2011-04-15T13:52:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	its the same when im logged on to the server itself
2011-04-15T13:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	via alt + fn VT's =
2011-04-15T13:53:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	but I changed my used to use zsh, and I can use e now (as you can see), but lftp wont let me type it
2011-04-15T13:54:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	alt + fn as in function?
2011-04-15T13:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	yes
2011-04-15T13:59:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	you lost me, sorry
2011-04-15T13:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	you may want to check "sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" and see if everythng is ok
2011-04-15T14:01:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	ive done it several times, checked every setting and compared to another server it works on, still no go.. it seems like the letter e in lowercase is somehow changed to do a different function.. I can not figure out where and what
2011-04-15T14:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	:/ well i really dunno; it is weird that it wrks in zsh but not in bash
2011-04-15T14:03:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	indeed
2011-04-15T14:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	if all terminal apps failed the same way ...
2011-04-15T14:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	because it also works in your irc client but not in lftp :( inconsistencies hard to explain
2011-04-15T14:04:00.000Z	Sverd	erUSUL	in bash everything fails... in zsh i havent had any problems untill now, when I tried to use lftp
2011-04-15T14:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Sverd	maybe the exported $TERM var in bash ?
