2005-03-07T14:05:00.000Z	CountDown		Hey hawke_, bborkk here.  I figured out the wxPython problem.
2005-03-07T14:05:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	Oh?  What was it?
2005-03-07T14:06:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	Turns out my PYTHONPATH variable wasn't set and wxPython2.4 didn't know how to deal with multiple installs of wxPython without it.
2005-03-07T14:07:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	Ah, that makes sense I suppose.  Fun fun.
2005-03-07T14:07:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	More fun than I was looking for, but at least everything works now.
2005-03-07T14:08:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	inotify is some sort of interrupt handler or something?
2005-03-07T14:09:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	I think it's some sort of mechanism where the kernel notifies a process when a file changes.
2005-03-07T14:09:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	So you got picard to work?
2005-03-07T14:10:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	What is picard?  You mentioned that yesterday.
2005-03-07T14:10:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	Oh, n/m then...I figured that's what you were trying to use since you agreed when I mentioned it yesterday.  It's the next-gen musicbrainz tagger application.
2005-03-07T14:11:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	It's the only thing I've seen that depends on wxpython2.5.3
2005-03-07T14:11:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	Oh, right.  No, I just knew that it was wxPython-based.
2005-03-07T14:11:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	My code depends on wxpython2.5.3.  :)
2005-03-07T14:11:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	Gotcha.  What code is that? :-)
2005-03-07T14:12:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	I'm writing a couple of things.  One is a featureful low-level serial port terminal.
2005-03-07T14:12:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	Another is an interface for monitoring and controlling wireless sensor networks.
2005-03-07T14:13:00.000Z	hawke_	CountDown	cool
2005-03-07T14:14:00.000Z	CountDown	hawke_	Well, hopefully it will be when I'm finished.  :)
