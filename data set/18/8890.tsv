2008-07-03T20:27:00.000Z	Ayabara		when my laptop enters sleepmode the screen goes black but is still lit. anything I can do to fix this?
2008-07-03T20:28:00.000Z	Ayabara		will a blank screen screensaver do the same as a display sleep?
2008-07-03T20:28:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	not for LCD, since the light will stay on
2008-07-03T20:29:00.000Z	Ayabara	WalloO	ok. I have an lcd. should the light be turned off when it hits sleep?
2008-07-03T20:30:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	when you screen is in sleep morde, it's technicaky turned of
2008-07-03T20:31:00.000Z	Ayabara	WalloO	agree, but when it lights up a dark room it's hard to believe it :)
2008-07-03T20:32:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	it means it's not in sleep mode' You may have just a black screen
2008-07-03T20:32:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	when in sleep mode, the screen should change (power button change color or blink)
2008-07-03T20:33:00.000Z	Ayabara	WalloO	the lowest I can set the "put display to sleep" is 11 minutes. is there a way I can make it enter display sleep at once to test? I only want the display to sleep, and the rest of the system to be operative
2008-07-03T20:34:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	it should be possible, but I don't know the command to do that. Search google for that

2008-07-03T20:35:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	it'S for gentoo, but maybe will do the job
2008-07-03T20:36:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	simpler: http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/149/turn-off-laptop-lcd-monitor/
2008-07-03T20:36:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	use this command: xset dpms force off
2008-07-03T20:37:00.000Z	Ayabara	WalloO	thanks a lot
2008-07-03T20:37:00.000Z	WalloO	Ayabara	I just used google... :)
