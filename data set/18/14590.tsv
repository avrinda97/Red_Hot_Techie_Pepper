2005-07-08T14:11:00.000Z	jtan325		here's a totally newbie question... what is the difference between 386, 586, 686?
2005-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	jtan325		i know 386 is the old processor
2005-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	jtan325		and 586 is pretty much the pentiums
2005-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	jtan325		but yeah....
2005-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	jtan325		i just realized alot of the stuff i've been configuring has been 386, but i have a pentium 4
2005-07-08T14:13:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	386 was the first intel processor that supported multitasking.. 486 was next, 586 was pentium, and Pentium II and above (including celeron) are 686
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	totem
2005-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	jtan325	frequency	but the support for file types is not as good as mplayer, right?
2005-07-08T14:28:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	i haven't had a problem with it (well, except when trying to play MOV and WMV files)
2005-07-08T14:28:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	you won't find them in there..  the codecs aren't specific to totem
2005-07-08T14:29:00.000Z	jtan325	frequency	what do you mean? so do i have to install extra plugins for totem?
2005-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	jtan325	frequency	also, right now when i open an avi with totem, totem launches, but then quits right away, without displaying anything
2005-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	they're like plugins.. they're called codecs
2005-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	jtan325	frequency	right. what's the name of these codecs?
2005-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	go to the link ubotu provided
2005-07-08T14:32:00.000Z	jtan325	frequency	what on this wiki page should i look at?
2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	that link should take you straight to a set of instructions on how to install all the codecs for AVIs, MPEGs, etc..
2005-07-08T14:34:00.000Z	frequency	jtan325	i gave the wrong link
