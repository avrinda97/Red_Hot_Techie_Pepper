2005-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	funkyHat		is nvu gtk+2 or Qt?
2005-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	gtk
2005-07-26T07:41:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	not official, but not as much of a sin as before
2005-07-26T07:43:00.000Z	funkyHat	topyli	i'll stick with just universe and multiverse anyway, i'd like my system to work :D
2005-09-01T05:46:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	use the framebuffer
2005-09-01T05:47:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	i have "vga=791" on my default kernel line in grub's menu.lst and get 1024x780 (or whatever it is)
2005-09-01T05:51:00.000Z	funkyHat	topyli	can you #flood the relevant part of your menu.lst please?
2005-09-01T05:53:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-5-k7 root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=791 quiet splash
2005-09-01T05:54:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	just add the vga option at the end of the line
2005-09-01T05:55:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	for other resolutions, search the web for their hex codes, you might not like 791
2005-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	found it: http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO-5.html#ss5.3
2005-09-01T06:08:00.000Z	funkyHat	topyli	they are all different:S
2005-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	must be an old howto :-(
2005-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	funkyHat	topyli	i found this one anyway: http://www.webservertalk.com/archive112-2004-1-80916.html
2005-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	that looks better
2005-09-01T06:13:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	you may lose the console, but you should still have X :)
2005-09-01T06:13:00.000Z	funkyHat	topyli	gnome terminal windows will still work anyway won't they?
2005-09-01T06:14:00.000Z	topyli	funkyHat	yes, they should
