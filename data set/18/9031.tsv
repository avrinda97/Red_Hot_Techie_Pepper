2007-05-29T11:01:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	vlc is pretty for casual viewing, Mythtv gives you a more dedicated entertainmnet box
2007-07-19T10:06:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	works, but wine puts some overhead on top, so it's no 'micro'
2007-10-24T01:53:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	was it present when you initially installed?
2007-10-24T01:53:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	No
2007-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	so i guess you're missing the floppy driver modules
2007-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	So what do I install?
2007-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	I mean, it appears in the Computer browser
2007-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	but it just won't do alot with it, format says it's complete instantly yet nothing happens
2007-10-24T01:59:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils/ might be interesting
2007-10-24T02:00:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	But what do I install to be able to use them from nautilus? they appear but Ubuntu doesn't work properly with them
2007-10-24T02:00:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	Is there an apt package for it?
2007-10-24T02:00:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	it's not that well supported. requires manual tinkering.
2007-10-24T02:01:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	stefg	Well it mounts, so what could be wrong?
2007-10-24T02:01:00.000Z	stefg	Moduliz0r	read the link i gave you. fdutils don't work with usb-floppies, b/c they don't have direct acces to the fdc
