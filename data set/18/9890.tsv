2007-03-10T06:40:00.000Z	PiNE		i have checked google and the forums and can't find anything related to my sound warning, i would really like some help with it.
2007-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	use http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems and pastebin the info
2007-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	then tell me the URL.
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	thanks i am checking into that right now.
2007-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	i was going to give you some long winded details about my situation but, although i don't fully understand them, i think this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9544/  will be way more comprehensive then anything i would have said!.
2007-03-10T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	so your audio in inaudible?
2007-03-10T06:54:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	yep except in rhythmbox and listen music player.
2007-03-10T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	are you using Software Sound Mixing (in System> Preferences> Sound) ?
2007-03-10T06:55:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	all system sounds do not work. vlc, mplayer, totem and amorok all do not work
2007-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	ok, start by unmuting 'Master' and muting 'IEC958'
2007-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	the essential question is whether you want to use your onboard or your usb
2007-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	currently the default audio device is the onboard, not the usb
2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	i want it to be the usb
2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	in a Terminal, execute:  asoundconf set-default-card UA25
2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	then, log out and back in
2007-03-10T06:58:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	okay i'll give that a try. see you soon!
2007-03-10T08:27:00.000Z	PiNE	crimsun	yep that completely worked the sound is back! thanks for the help.
2007-03-10T08:27:00.000Z	crimsun	PiNE	np.
