2006-12-05T11:35:00.000Z	mark__		any reason why burning an image always produces unreadable CDs while same image works fine when burnt with win-nero? I tried k3b, nerolinux, etc.
2006-12-05T11:36:00.000Z	emss	mark__	what are you using to burn the image?
2006-12-05T11:36:00.000Z	mark__	emss	i used k3b and nerolinux
2006-12-05T11:38:00.000Z	emss	mark__	well try to mount the burned cd
2006-12-05T11:39:00.000Z	mark__	emss	the final verification fails in both cases with read errors and the cd (kubuntu) is unbootable
2006-12-05T11:39:00.000Z	emss	mark__	no try to mount the cd
2006-12-05T11:39:00.000Z	emss	mark__	not to boot it, maybe the image is being burned as a file to the cd instead of being expanded or whatever the correct terminology is
2006-12-05T11:40:00.000Z	emss	mark__	you can try in a console typing 'cdrecord cdrom.img' that should burn it properly
2006-12-05T11:42:00.000Z	mark__	emss	ok, I'll sacrifice my last CD to try the cdrecord trick. By the way: the cd is written correctly. To be more precise, it boots but when I choose "Install" from the menu it fails because of reading errors.
2006-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	emss	mark__	oh don't burn
2006-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	emss	mark__	you should md5 check the cd image then
2006-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	mark__	emss	too late :-)
2006-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	emss	mark__	the image is probably messed up
2006-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	emss	mark__	incomplete that is
2006-12-05T11:44:00.000Z	mark__	emss	I already verified it. the same file works well when burnt with nero for windwos
2006-12-05T11:45:00.000Z	mark__	emss	cdrecord tells me "Error: Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability.Is cdrecord installed SUID root?" but burns nevertheless
2006-12-05T11:45:00.000Z	emss	mark__	ok then I doubt you will have any different results, because k3b is just a frontend to command line programs: cdrecord, cdrdao etc.
2006-12-05T11:46:00.000Z	mark__	emss	I read somewhere that TAO mode could cause some problems with certain drives.
