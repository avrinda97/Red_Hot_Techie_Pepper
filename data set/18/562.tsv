2011-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	You just make one. What kind of graphics card are you using?
2011-12-23T07:41:00.000Z	r_tarandus	rypervenche	some integrated intel one. where/how do i make one?
2011-12-23T07:42:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	You can run "sudo Xorg -configure" to make a generic one
2011-12-23T07:42:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	It will show up in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-12-23T07:44:00.000Z	r_tarandus	rypervenche	tried that, but terminal says--- Fatal server error:
2011-12-23T07:44:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	Ah, which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2011-12-23T07:44:00.000Z	r_tarandus	rypervenche	latest/oneiric 11.10
2011-12-23T07:45:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	press ctrl+alt+F2, login as your user, then type "sudo service gdm3 stop" then "sudo Xorg -configure", then "sudo service gdm3 start", and it should automatically send you back to GDM, if not press ctl+alt+F7
2011-12-23T07:46:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	This will stop your X session, so save anything you're using.
2011-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	r_tarandus	rypervenche	can you repeat those instructions again, please? i'm sorry. i pressed ctrl/alt/f2 before reading all the instructions and then it went fullscreen and i couldnt get out of it, so ended up rebooting.
2011-12-23T07:52:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	press ctrl+alt+F2, login as your user, then type "sudo service gdm3 stop" then "sudo Xorg -configure", then "sudo service gdm3 start", and it should automatically send you back to GDM, if not press ctl+alt+F7
2011-12-23T07:53:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	Yes.
2011-12-23T07:55:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	Oh, it may stick it in /root, in which case you'd need to do "sudo mv /root/xorg.conf /etc/X11/"
2011-12-23T07:55:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	Yes, you need Xrandr.
2011-12-23T07:56:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	You could make one in your keyboard shortcuts.
2011-12-23T08:02:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	looks like "xrandr --rotate left" or something like that would work.
2011-12-23T08:04:00.000Z	rypervenche	r_tarandus	I found all of that out just by "man xrandr"
2011-12-23T08:04:00.000Z	r_tarandus	rypervenche	you too! thanks.
