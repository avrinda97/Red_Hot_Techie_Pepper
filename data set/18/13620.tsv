2008-04-01T06:59:00.000Z	linxeh		heh
2008-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	linxeh		is there an easy way to upgrade to a new release ?
2008-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	linxeh		I'm remote from the machine atm, so don't really want to run X if I can help it
2008-04-01T07:02:00.000Z	linxeh		should I just edit the apt sources file ?
2008-04-01T07:02:00.000Z	linxeh		ok :)

2008-04-01T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	linxeh	bazhang: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades
2008-08-20T06:13:00.000Z	linxeh	Flannel	not yet :/ he's new. he needs to know how things work first
2009-06-10T04:47:00.000Z	linxeh	Flannel	so do a network install
2009-06-10T04:47:00.000Z	Flannel	linxeh	Not installing, upgrading.
2009-07-04T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	linxeh	Please don't do that.
2009-07-04T05:29:00.000Z	linxeh	Flannel	sorry, I've had a night of non-googlers on another channel - I'll restrain myself
2009-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	Flannel	linxeh	Your restraint is much appreciated.  There's good reasons not to behave like that, and if you're curious why that's a policy, I'd be happy to share
2009-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	linxeh	Flannel	I can appreciate why that is policy; Ive been on the end of it in the past :)
2009-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	linxeh	Flannel	apologies once again
2009-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	Flannel	linxeh	Oh, it's no problem.  We all get frustrated at times.  And I only offered to explain because some people don't see the point
