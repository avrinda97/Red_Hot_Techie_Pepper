2010-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	Baribal		(which are all drives that are other things)
2010-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	brianherman_home		BARIBAL: sda5 sorry
2010-01-09T09:28:00.000Z	Baribal	brianherman_home	that's my first HD, swap space.
2010-01-09T09:29:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	type mount what do you see
2010-01-09T09:30:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	Have you tryed running gParted?
2010-01-09T09:31:00.000Z	Baribal	brianherman_home	there's a partition on the cell phone already.
2010-01-09T09:31:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	You can use gparted to mount devices
2010-01-09T09:31:00.000Z	Baribal		I don't want to overwtire the phones partition, I'm pretty sure that'd cause major problems!
2010-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	It wont trust me it will just mount it
2010-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	You can just right click and mount the partition
2010-01-09T09:32:00.000Z	Baribal		I can not, there's no icon for that devoce, and as the pase showed, direct mount doesn't work either.
2010-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	it must be in some format that linux cannot recognize then
2010-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	sorry
2010-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	wait gparted can do things that normal users cannot
2010-01-09T09:34:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Baribal	It wont format it
