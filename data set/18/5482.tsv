2009-09-23T21:18:00.000Z	ZmAY		can someone help me reconfigure fstab, i need some partition to be mounted at boot, which paramaters should i insert
2009-09-23T21:19:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	you can use something called storage device manager it will help you mount the devices you want at startup
2009-09-23T21:23:00.000Z	ZmAY	shredder12	in column 4, which parameters should i put
2009-09-23T21:24:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	 you mean 4th column in /etc/fstab file??
2009-09-23T21:25:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	in my fstab file..  i used "defaults" to mount my windows ntfs partitions
2009-09-23T21:26:00.000Z	ZmAY	shredder12	i have "umask=077" for my win7 partition
2009-09-23T21:26:00.000Z	ZmAY	shredder12	and it works, i now need to mount ubuntu partition, but parameter "auto" doesent work
2009-09-23T21:26:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	 you should try storage device manager.. it will do everything for you....
2009-09-23T21:27:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	 my options look like "/dev/sda1 /media/disk ntfs defaults 0 0"
2009-09-23T21:27:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	/dev/sda1 is the C:/
2009-09-23T21:27:00.000Z	ZmAY	shredder12	/dev/sda1        /mnt/win         ntfs-3g     umask=077        1   0
2009-09-23T21:29:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	stil.. try replacing it will defaults.. and reboot.. it won't do any harm..
2009-09-23T21:29:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	 it will either mount or not
2009-09-23T21:29:00.000Z	ZmAY	shredder12	that line i gave u works, and mounts win7, but i need to mount other ubuntu partition, which doesent mount, also if i give auto option
2009-09-23T21:32:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	if it is an ubuntu partition the use something like "/dev/you_partition /media/folder ext3 defaults 0 0"
2009-09-23T21:33:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	 I am sure about this.. but doint something wrong in your fstab file.. jst won't mount.. so you may give it a try.. or if you have something better
2009-09-23T21:34:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	try man reiserfs
2009-09-23T21:34:00.000Z	shredder12	ZmAY	i read it in man fstab
