2006-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	theoretically, yes
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	have you read the qemu xp installation page for ubuntu?  the licensing bit is a riot
2006-06-13T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	no, you have a quick link?
2006-06-13T06:16:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
2006-06-13T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	I gotta adapt that for restricted formats :)
2006-06-13T06:34:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	I think you must use gcc-3.4 for kernel stuff, I think the kernel is still built with that. Not sure, though
2006-06-21T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	well, he does have standing
2006-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	dpkg --get-selections > IwantThesePackages
2006-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	then, dpkg --set-selections < IwantThesePackages
2006-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	after the install
2006-06-27T09:23:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	does that get everything or just my choices?
2006-06-27T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	just your installed packages, based on the current state when you to the --get-selections
2006-06-27T09:25:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	and that ">" pushes them to a file and the "<" pulls them from a file?
2006-06-27T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	exactly.
2006-06-27T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	 > means write to a file, < means read from a file
2006-06-27T09:29:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	i'd be ok to trim those selections to just my extras, right?
2006-06-27T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	ToHellWithGA	I'd have to see to comment
2006-06-27T09:31:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	nickrud	we shall see :D
