2009-10-21T22:50:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	did you try enabling it in skype?
2009-10-21T22:51:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	one second...let me grab skype and test it out on my laptop. I think its just a hardware config.
2009-10-21T22:55:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	ok sorry- let me install skype now - one min :D
2009-10-21T22:57:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	so you do have skype installed just fine, program works right? on ubuntu?
2009-10-21T23:00:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	still with you - just downloading/installing :D
2009-10-21T23:01:00.000Z	cgroza	d33d	ok
2009-10-21T23:03:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	ok so lets go to... the little Skype icon at the bottom, click it, and go to options, then click on "Video Devices" on the left hand column and make sure that "Enable Skype Video" is CHECKED, and what's listed in the "Select Webcam" area?
2009-10-21T23:04:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	when you click it - do you get any other options?
2009-10-21T23:05:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	interesting. ... seems like skype can't see your cam - UNLESS that's your camera just named /dev/video0 by default...
2009-10-21T23:06:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	what's the camera again? Make / Model and What version of Ubuntu and Skype are you running?
2009-10-21T23:08:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	try following this - see if that works. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=651375
2009-10-21T23:09:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	im no master at this...can you get anymore information on the camera (Eg: Logitech Quickcam Express...? Express II??
2009-10-21T23:12:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	well it looks like the majority of all the cameras work https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeWebCams
2009-10-21T23:12:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	are you on beta yet?
2009-10-21T23:13:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	This is coming from my perspective, I'm no ubuntu-master of any sorts, but 9.10 karmic koala is fantastic, its pretty solid since I've been using it. I really enjoy it.
2009-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	d33d	cgroza	try out the stable. that's always safest.
