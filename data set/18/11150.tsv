2007-09-17T05:30:00.000Z	luckyone		can anyone in here help me get my system to output 1920x1080?
2007-09-17T05:31:00.000Z	luckyone		my xorg.conf file is located here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37636/
2007-09-17T05:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	maybe.. do you know how to get to your xorg file?
2007-09-17T05:31:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	xorg.conf file is here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37636/
2007-09-17T05:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	that link is no good anymore.
2007-09-17T05:32:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37636/ it just worked for me
2007-09-17T05:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	got it... brb
2007-09-17T05:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	ah.. you're running it on a Visio?  is that the native res of the visio?
2007-09-17T05:34:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	I found that modeline here: www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/printthread.php?t=818988&page=5&pp=30
2007-09-17T05:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	I also saw 1360x768...
2007-09-17T05:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	but native seems to be confirmed in other sites at 1920x1080
2007-09-17T05:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	have you tried "nvidia-settings" or "nvidia-settings" from the command line?
2007-09-17T05:41:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	yes, nvidia-settings doesn't show me the 1920x1080 that my tv can display
2007-09-17T05:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	let me look closer at your xorg.. brb
2007-09-17T05:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	here's mine http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37637/  anything with a # is commented out and non functional.. you'll notice that my screen size options are in metric (or some other value). You might have to use that type of referance to get it right.  I googled some time ago for that info.  Sorry I don't have a link.. Also I'm on Dapper (which shouldn't make much differance.)
2007-09-17T05:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	luckyone	when logging in change "sessions".  if you don't have gdm installed then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-09-17T05:48:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	the problem is that I can't read the screen on login
2007-09-17T05:49:00.000Z	luckyone	Scunizi	the text is too small
