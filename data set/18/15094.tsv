2011-05-30T11:30:00.000Z	moltendorf	yagoo	Would it still be smart for me to set it up, even though I use my domain provider's nameservers for everything?
2011-05-30T11:31:00.000Z	moltendorf	yagoo	*d'oh*
2011-05-30T11:31:00.000Z	moltendorf	yagoo	I don't think you understand the nature of my question.
2011-05-30T11:31:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	why all the trouble to set up bind9?  if you can "ping -c 1 www.google.com" then tha's all sendmail bneeds
2011-05-30T11:32:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	yagoo is a troll.  also try a php channel
2011-05-30T11:33:00.000Z	moltendorf		I'm asking them because I just transferred from a fleet of managed, pre-configured servers to three colocation servers. :)
2011-05-30T11:33:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	all you have to have working is client dns
2011-05-30T11:33:00.000Z	moltendorf		...and I am the sysadmin for them. :)
2011-05-30T11:34:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	test dns with "ping -c 1 www.google.com" or "dig +short www.google.com"
2011-05-30T11:34:00.000Z	moltendorf		I got it all working; I was just asking a couple of dumb questions to ensure I don't have bloat on my server. :P
2011-05-30T11:34:00.000Z	moltendorf		I already had dns working, I had that all configured when I initially deployed my boxes on the 18th. :)
2011-05-30T11:35:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	then sendmail should work
2011-05-30T11:35:00.000Z	moltendorf		It does. :P
2011-05-30T11:35:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	you can try to run dns yourslef for security but then you might make a mistake and wind up less secure
2011-05-30T11:35:00.000Z	moltendorf		You guys are so lost at my question and how dumb it actually was, I guess. :P
2011-05-30T11:36:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	try asking about sending mail on a php channel
2011-05-30T11:36:00.000Z	ryoohki	moltendorf	you have a php question, not ubuntu
