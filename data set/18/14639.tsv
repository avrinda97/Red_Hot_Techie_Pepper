2005-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	nikkia		no
2005-07-02T16:58:00.000Z	nikkia		dmesg just shows you what has been reported, its useful for seeing if/why things failed
2005-07-02T16:59:00.000Z	nikkia		though
2005-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	nikkia		gnomeboyadvance, for example
2005-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	nikkia		gnomeboyadvance is in the repos
2005-07-02T05:00:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	gnomeboyadvance is like VBA?
2005-07-02T05:01:00.000Z	nikkia	bigfoot1	its a front-end to VBA
2005-07-02T05:07:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	how do i get gnomeboyadvance from the backports?
2005-07-02T05:07:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	how do i add it? is it safe to add the backports to my list?
2005-07-02T05:20:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	i see.
2005-07-02T05:22:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	do you have backports repos in your sources.list?
2005-07-02T05:22:00.000Z	nikkia	bigfoot1	'sudo dpkg -i   some_file.deb'
2005-07-02T05:23:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	will that command work on a deb file downloaded from internet to my harddrive?
2005-07-02T05:24:00.000Z	nikkia	bigfoot1	yes, although it may tell you that you need to install other things first
2005-07-02T05:24:00.000Z	nikkia	bigfoot1	both
2005-07-02T05:30:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	can you paste to me your sources. list? I'd like to take a look at your backports text.
2005-07-02T05:32:00.000Z	bigfoot1	nikkia	i thought if you could just paste the text in your sources.list that's got to do with the backports, it won't be too long.
