2007-06-24T14:26:00.000Z	alesan		is it possible to make my user able to run programs with root privileges without sudo? or should I really enable the root user from the graphical login?
2007-06-24T14:27:00.000Z	alesan		I'm getting tired to type my (rather long) root password every few minutes
2007-06-24T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	use sudo
2007-06-24T14:27:00.000Z	alesan	Gnea	you miss the point
2007-06-24T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	no, i don't. use sudo, and change your password.
2007-06-24T14:28:00.000Z	alesan	Gnea	I do NOT want to type the root password.
2007-06-24T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	sudo uses the user password, not root's.
2007-06-24T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	try it: sudo su
2007-06-24T14:28:00.000Z	alesan	Gnea	or sudo -i that's not the point I repeat
2007-06-24T14:29:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	*again*, change your password if you're paranoid about it
2007-06-24T14:29:00.000Z	alesan	Gnea	stop please I got your point and I am not interested
2007-06-24T14:30:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	fine, good luck then.
2007-06-24T14:30:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	you could just leave your user account passwordless and run programs with sudo
2007-06-24T14:31:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	then write some shell scripts to bind those commands to buttons so you can just click on them on the desktop or menu
2007-06-24T14:32:00.000Z	alesan	Gnea	a "button" for iwconfig?
2007-06-24T14:33:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	so the sun was glaring off the screen?
2009-03-12T23:53:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	as long as they're the same arch: 32bit or 64bit
2010-12-19T15:11:00.000Z	Gnea	alesan	impossible to do here
