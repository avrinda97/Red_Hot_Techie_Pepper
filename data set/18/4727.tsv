2010-05-24T00:15:00.000Z	dark_	noren	no i installed it in the same drive as windiws
2010-05-24T00:16:00.000Z	noren	dark_	i guess u did a wubi install and did not make a separate partion for installing ubuntu
2010-05-24T00:18:00.000Z	noren	dark_	installing ubuntu in wubi is good for testing it out for ppl new to linux, i wud suggest a do a separte and clean install of ubuntu..

2010-05-24T00:19:00.000Z	noren	dark_	for ubuntu u wud need ext3/ext4 partition which u can make easily at the start of installing the ubuntu
2010-05-24T00:21:00.000Z	noren	dark_	select guided partition and install this will get you both the ubuntu and windows both on the same drive, but they will be installed on different partition on ur drive
2010-05-24T00:22:00.000Z	noren	dark_	use the ubuntu desktop installer cd >> start the installation process and use the guided partiton everything wud be automated almost, including the ext partition and installing ubuntu
