2009-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	Andorin		Can someone please help me with installing a control theme for GNOME?
2009-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Andorin	don't you just drag and drop the file into the theme manager?
2009-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	Maybe that would work if this came with an .xml file, but this is just a bunch of .png images and a gtkrc.txt file.
2009-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		I'd suggest just googling to hell and back
2009-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		since no one is helping you here. And you've been asking for a while.
2009-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	I did. I got this. http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/themes-3.html.en It doesn't really help.
2009-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Andorin	put them in /usr/share/themes/option-name/pixmaps/*.*
2009-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		or somewhere in ~/,themes
2009-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	I thought that the directory had to exist in order for that to work, but there's no pixmaps directory... I suppose I'll try creating it.
2009-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		errr, there should be
2009-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		don't create one..
2009-08-01T08:03:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		!spanish
2009-08-01T08:04:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Andorin	just drop it in /usr/share/themes or ~/.themes
2009-08-01T08:05:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	I did, and it doesn't show up in the Appearances window.
2009-08-01T08:05:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		!9.10
2009-08-01T08:06:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	And after creating a pixmaps folder and dropping the files in there, then switching to the theme, I see no change.
2009-08-01T08:08:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Andorin	/uar/share/NAME_OF_THE_THEME/pixmaps?
2009-08-01T08:08:00.000Z	Andorin	shazbotmcnasty	Yes.
