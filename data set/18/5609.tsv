2009-01-02T05:23:00.000Z	savvas	keres	ubuntu 8.10 intrepid?
2009-01-02T05:23:00.000Z	keres	savvas	8.04
2009-01-02T05:23:00.000Z	savvas	keres	try upgrade to 8.10 or try the live cd at least, I think they've improved the sftp function a lot
2009-01-02T05:24:00.000Z	keres	savvas	i used to run intrepid, but i need alot of progs that use older versions of gtk. can you run newer nautilus versions without intrepid
2009-01-02T05:26:00.000Z	savvas	keres	I think it's generally risky and not recommended. What do you need the sftp for? Use ftp, it would probably work :) You could also get used to the command line and commands such as scp and sftp :)
2009-01-02T05:27:00.000Z	keres	savvas	it's my website. i don't host it, so the host gave me shell access through sftp.
2009-01-02T05:30:00.000Z	savvas	keres	you can use ftp in nautilus with the same way you use sftp: nautilus ftp://user@yourhost.com
2009-01-02T05:30:00.000Z	keres	savvas	could not display, host not found
2009-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	savvas	keres	er.. did you change the "yourhost.com" and "username" to your host/domain and username?
2009-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	keres	savvas	yeah...
2009-01-02T05:32:00.000Z	savvas	keres	Well, I believe there's no harm done in asking for an ftp account - it will help you stay on 8.04 :)
