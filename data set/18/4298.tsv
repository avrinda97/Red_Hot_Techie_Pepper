2009-05-02T15:08:00.000Z	mudassar		can somebody solve my problem in private ?
2009-05-02T15:09:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	more people may be able to help if you keep it in the public channel
2009-05-02T15:10:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	what port is your voip software trying to use? did you open that port on your firewall?
2009-05-02T15:11:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	how can I check it ? I am new to ubuntu (linux)
2009-05-02T15:11:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	from your router's configuration interface
2009-05-02T15:12:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	or netcat to that port from outside.
2009-05-02T15:12:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	I am not getting you actually I am new here in linux and don't know much about shell scripting

2009-05-02T15:16:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	this link will be helpful I think, but how can I do what it says with my router ?
2009-05-02T15:22:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	I have found the link on my D-Link router, it shows me how to do the port forwarding to the internal IP address. But I guess when ever I am connected to the network of my room, I will be assigned a new IP. So how can I fix that IP ? may be by giving static IP ?
2009-05-02T15:24:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	yes
2009-05-02T15:24:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	ok let me give it a try
2009-05-02T15:24:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	a static ip will also require some reconfiguration of your ubuntu setup
2009-05-02T15:27:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	can you help me changing the configuration to static iP ?
2009-05-02T15:28:00.000Z	Boohbah	mudassar	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex.html   should work for jaunty too
2009-05-02T15:36:00.000Z	mudassar	Boohbah	there are some private and public ports in the map fields ... what public port should I give?
