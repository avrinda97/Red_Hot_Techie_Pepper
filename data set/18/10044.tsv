2007-02-06T16:42:00.000Z	Slike		hello
2007-02-06T16:42:00.000Z	Slike		i'm having a problem to configure 3 nic's in 1 pc
2007-02-06T16:42:00.000Z	Slike		lspci shows all of them, while ifconfig shows only 2
2007-02-06T16:43:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 try ifconfig -a
2007-02-06T16:45:00.000Z	Slike	unop	thanks, discovered that the 3rd card is bound to eth3
2007-02-06T16:46:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 can i ask why you use 3 cards? aint that a bit overboard? :)
2007-02-06T16:47:00.000Z	Slike	unop	where trying to reconfigure a gateway that should provide access to 3 different networks
2007-02-06T16:47:00.000Z	Slike	unop	we're ... :P
2007-02-06T16:47:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 ahh ok, router :)
2007-02-06T17:02:00.000Z	Slike	unop	i just rebooted, now the nics are eth0, eth1, eth2.....previous boot it was eth0,eth1, eth3. is there a way to keep these settings?
2007-02-06T17:03:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 errm, yea, there is a way .. i think it's one of the files in /etc/network .. options i think
2007-02-06T17:04:00.000Z	Slike	unop	ok, i'll have a look
2007-02-06T17:06:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 sorry no -- it's this one /etc/iftab
2007-02-06T17:13:00.000Z	Slike	unop	strange stuff: /etc/network/interfaces, eth0/1/2 settings specified == @boot eth0,1,3  , if eth0/1/3 settings specified == @boot eth0,1,2   as if the eth2 settings cause ubuntu to skip that and assign eth3 or vice versa...
2007-02-06T17:13:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 did you check /etc/iftab?
2007-02-06T17:14:00.000Z	Slike	unop	thx, only eth0 and eth1 are specified there, i'll change that
2007-02-06T17:15:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 you can specify additional interface maps there - just follow one of those entries as a template and create new ones
2007-02-16T09:21:00.000Z	unop	Slike	 /etc/crontab  for system tasks -- sudo crontab -e  for root's tab
