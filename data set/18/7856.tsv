2007-11-15T00:11:00.000Z	lucio123		no one knows what I should do to run ZSNES (supernintendo emulator)?
2007-11-15T00:12:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	sudo apt-get install zsnes
2007-11-15T00:17:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	what program?
2007-11-15T00:18:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	does it say anything if you try to start it from a terminal?
2007-11-15T00:19:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	btw your IRC client probably has auto completion so you can write my name with Ens<TAB>
2007-11-15T00:20:00.000Z	lucio123	Enselic_	(Thank you) I don't use the IRC program a lot....
2007-11-15T00:23:00.000Z	lucio123	Enselic_	I get the following msg "unable to poll /dev/input/event6. make sure you have read permissions to it.... (what do you think?)
2007-11-15T00:24:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	what does   ls -l /dev/input/event6   give you?
2007-11-15T00:25:00.000Z	lucio123	Enselic_	this: crw-rw---- 1 root root 13, 70 2007-11-14 16:46 /dev/input/event6
2007-11-15T00:26:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	hmm   well you could run zsnes as root but taht is dangerous
2007-11-15T00:26:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	ON YOUR OWN RISK:   sudo zsnes
2007-11-15T00:27:00.000Z	lucio123	Enselic_	no problem still doesn't work.....
2007-11-15T00:27:00.000Z	Enselic_	lucio123	what does it say now?
2007-11-15T00:27:00.000Z	lucio123	Enselic_	 I will try later (my wife is calling me for diner)
