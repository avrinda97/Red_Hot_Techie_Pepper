2006-04-27T12:00:00.000Z	pvd2006		I see why it doenst work its trying to open the file with a space in it but it needs the %20 instead of a regular space so it wont find the file...
2006-04-27T12:00:00.000Z	pvd2006		crap
2006-04-27T12:00:00.000Z	pvd2006		I dont know how to get past hat
2006-04-27T12:02:00.000Z	pvd2006		so how to get opera to save the file and automaticlly put a %20 for all spaces or how to get linux to automatically recognize a space as %20.
2006-04-27T12:03:00.000Z	pvd2006		So is there a way to get linux to automatically assocate %20 with a space and vice versa when trying to open a file with %20 in it?
2006-04-27T12:04:00.000Z	pvd2006		because the program is look for a space but the actual file has %20
2006-04-27T12:04:00.000Z	eggzeck	pvd2006	escape it
2006-04-27T12:04:00.000Z	pvd2006	eggzeck	what do you mean by that exactly?
2006-04-27T12:04:00.000Z	eggzeck	pvd2006	\%20
2006-04-27T12:05:00.000Z	pvd2006	eggzeck	it already has %20 in the filename it self, but when it tries to open from opera it tries to open it with a space instead of %20 and it doesnt find it.
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		so I guess
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		I have to manually
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		find the url for each file
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		then put %20 in it
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		and hit enter in my url
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		browser
2006-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pvd2006		*
2006-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	eggzeck	pvd2006	I dunno about file->open but you'd have to escape the % if typing directly in browser
