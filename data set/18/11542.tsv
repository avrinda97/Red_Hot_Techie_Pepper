2006-07-16T11:27:00.000Z	harisund		I have a quick question. What is the command to modify the groups a user is in ?
2006-07-16T11:27:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	edit /etc/group
2006-07-16T11:28:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	there is no such file?
2006-07-16T11:28:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	sudo nano /etc/group
2006-07-16T11:29:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	sweet. Thanks :). But I am somewhat not very keen on editing a file.. no command to do that?
2006-07-16T11:29:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	linuxconf will do it... i think there is  packages
2006-07-16T11:30:00.000Z	timbobsteve		package*
2006-07-16T11:30:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	what is it called? linuxconf?
2006-07-16T11:30:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	I think so... not sure... it used to come on RedHat 5.2 :P
2006-07-16T11:31:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	atleast it is not called linuxconf directly. sudo apt-cache search --names-only linuxconf doesn't work.. it works on RedHat, then I am guessing it works on Fedora as well..
2006-07-16T11:31:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	google it and see... i think it is source only most of the time... it really is easier to just edit the files
2006-07-16T11:31:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	I will .. thanks ... and yes, it is easier to edit config files (and btw, I use vi :D )
2006-07-16T11:32:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	eeeewwww vi :P hahahahaha
2006-07-16T11:32:00.000Z	timbobsteve		matex: rpm doesn't register with the apt database...
2006-07-16T11:32:00.000Z	harisund		heheh... and another question. What is the default, or somewhat safe default file permissions? 755 ?
2006-07-16T11:32:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	i think so
2006-07-16T11:33:00.000Z	harisund	timbobsteve	thanks a lot ... I will look up linuxconf and get back .. have a great day :)
2006-07-16T11:33:00.000Z	timbobsteve	harisund	u too
