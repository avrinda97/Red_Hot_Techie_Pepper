2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	gianp	michealPW	Thanks for letting me know about the BigMC issue.  Did the user in question manage to get things working, do you know?
2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	michealPW	gianp	I fixed their problem but I think they left before I found the solution :\
2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	michealPW	gianp	Oh! You're Gian aren't you?? :)
2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	gianp	michealPW	I am :)
2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	michealPW		Cool, nice to meet you! :)
2012-10-16T19:47:00.000Z	gianp	michealPW	He emailed me and I told him to use the latest version with the fix anyway so hopefully he gets it working.
2012-10-16T19:48:00.000Z	michealPW	gianp	Ah, were we trying to get an old version working hehe?
2012-10-16T19:48:00.000Z	gianp		I was mostly terrified at the idea of some poor soul using my flaky research software working :p
2012-10-16T19:48:00.000Z	gianp	michealPW	Yes.  The newest is 20120807.
2012-10-16T19:48:00.000Z	michealPW		Ohh, I see. LOL my bad :P
2012-10-16T19:49:00.000Z	gianp		Well, in fairness, I have no idea where he would even have obtained the old version, given that the website (as far as I know...) only includes a link to the newest version on Github.  *shrug* :)
2012-10-16T19:49:00.000Z	michealPW		I think we got it from a website
2012-10-16T19:49:00.000Z	michealPW		Let me scroll up and get the exact link
2012-10-16T19:50:00.000Z	michealPW		http://bigraph.org/bigmc/manual/Obtaining-BigMC.html
2012-10-16T19:50:00.000Z	michealPW		That's the link he/she posted and I got that old version from heeh
2012-10-16T19:50:00.000Z	gianp		Oh, whoops.  Yes, the manual would appear to be out of date.  I should fix that.
2012-10-16T19:50:00.000Z	michealPW		Jah!
2012-10-16T19:50:00.000Z	gianp	michealPW	Anyway, thanks a bunch for helping to support my flaky software :p
