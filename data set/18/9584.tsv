2007-06-22T08:34:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	ah...
2007-06-22T08:34:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	yeah.. that means you don't have a parallel port on your actual computer
2007-06-22T08:35:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	if you don't have a parallel port on your actual computer.... your virtual machine can't have one
2007-06-22T08:35:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	its no big deal
2007-06-22T08:35:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	won't crash the vm or anything

2007-06-22T08:36:00.000Z	imbecile_	neozen	 thanks
2007-06-22T08:37:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	you might get a similar message regarding serial ports if your actual machine doesn't have any of those either
2007-06-22T08:37:00.000Z	imbecile_	neozen	 yeah i got that too
2007-06-22T08:37:00.000Z	neozen	imbecile_	most vms you get off the net (including those made by easyvmx) have support for serial/parellel ports on the off chance that your machine has them
2007-06-22T08:38:00.000Z	imbecile_	neozen	 cool ill just set it not to look for them
