2010-03-21T02:39:00.000Z	Neezer		I have no idea if installing lamp is what killed my gnome or not though. I haven't used the monitor on it in a long time...it has been all ssh access for the past 3 months or so.
2010-03-21T02:40:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	ps ax | grep gdm to see if it's running
2010-03-21T02:44:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	sorry about th delay, I did the command, how do I tell if it is running?
2010-03-21T02:44:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	if you see 'gdm' in the output, the Gnome Display Manager is running.
2010-03-21T02:45:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	odd. i haven't installed the LAMP stack as such on Ubuntu, only on Debian. i have played with Ubuntu Server Edition however, with no such problems.
2010-03-21T02:46:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	when i loggedin the first time a window popped up for upgrades, so I installed them. there weren't any bars at the tops of the windows though....then I rebooted from my laptop. so nobody is logged in on the server accept for me through ssh.
2010-03-21T02:47:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	in the console type 'pstree' and tell me what follows along the branch beginning with "login" in the output.
2010-03-21T02:48:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	if there is no "login", look for "Xorg" directly.
2010-03-21T02:48:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	I actually just tried sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop....it did install and didn't tell me that it was already there. I did a reboot just in case...then I'll try
2010-03-21T02:48:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	ok
2010-03-21T02:49:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	there is a login screen. it comes up with a list of the users and then other....
2010-03-21T02:49:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	thanks for the assistance btw. I really appreciate it.
2010-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	no probs at all.
2010-03-21T02:50:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	still no desktop. I'm running the tree right now via ssh.
2010-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	it says gdm-session-wor-----gnome-session and then a bunch of things off on the right.
2010-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	looks positive.. gnome's running.
2010-03-21T02:53:00.000Z	Neezer	julianoliver	is there a keyboard shortcut to open a terminal on the desktop?
2010-03-21T02:54:00.000Z	julianoliver	Neezer	i think there's an ALT-F2 or similar to bring up a run prompt. i'm on Debian here atm without Gnome..
