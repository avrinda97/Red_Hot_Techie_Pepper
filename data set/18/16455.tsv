2004-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	thom		morning
2004-09-24T05:04:00.000Z	thom		izit?
2004-09-24T05:05:00.000Z	cef	thom	we can only hope.. *grin*
2004-10-03T05:29:00.000Z	cef	thom	heh
2004-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	thom	cef	true, but sudo has been pretty damn reliable for me; never seen it die except when the binary gets nuked by disk corruption
2004-10-10T05:02:00.000Z	thom	cef	talked about that, what happens when the user changes his password?
2004-10-10T05:05:00.000Z	cef	thom	re: sudo and corruption: true.. but what if (and this is my whole point).. there is a security bug in sudo. they rush to release a fixed package, and in the process it breaks something for the majority of users, but not the developer who tested it (eg: a lib dependency).. suddenly, you have lots of non-working systems
2004-10-10T05:07:00.000Z	thom	cef	well, this assumes that the distribution doesn't test at all, either. but yes, i understand what you're saying, but the same could happen with PAM and a stack of other things
2004-10-10T05:08:00.000Z	cef	thom	true.. but we don't want to put in too many layers, else it's a testing nightmare.. (ie: lots of variables)
2004-10-10T05:09:00.000Z	cef	thom	no, I'm not saying giving root a password is the right thing, but it's one way to attack the issue (as I see it anyway)
2004-10-10T05:34:00.000Z	cef	thom	tsk tsk.. he doesn't pull them out of daniels' arse.... tho I think daniels does.. *grin*
2004-10-10T05:35:00.000Z	thom	cef	*g*
2004-10-10T05:35:00.000Z	cef	thom	then again, most of what daniels does is like that.. *coughapache2cough*
2004-10-10T05:36:00.000Z	thom	cef	don't i flippin' know it. "hi, i've done a new release, and it uses this whole new packaging system"
2004-10-10T05:36:00.000Z	thom	cef	i think i still have the email ;P
2004-10-10T05:36:00.000Z	cef	thom	heh
2004-10-10T05:51:00.000Z	cef	thom	one of these days, I'll consider getting the sparc I have online
2004-10-10T05:51:00.000Z	cef	thom	if only for the novelty value
