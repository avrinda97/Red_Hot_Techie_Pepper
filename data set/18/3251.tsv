2009-11-07T08:01:00.000Z	fenic	e6k3	I haven't had that issue, I've left my pc idle for hours on end and no issues with lockups
2009-11-07T08:02:00.000Z	e6k3	fenic	i am having problems of freezing since i upgraded......
2009-11-07T08:02:00.000Z	fenic	e6k3	do you have a screen saver turned on?  if so does it do anything fancy?  Try just the black screen and see if that works ok.  If so then it's something funky with that screen saver versus your video card maybe.
2009-11-07T08:03:00.000Z	e6k3	fenic	i had kept some downloads on which takes 6-7hrs...it just freezes after sometime
2009-11-07T08:03:00.000Z	e6k3	fenic	no screeensavers
