2010-03-18T05:18:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	you just type:  /join #empathy  and such and see if there's anyone there
2010-03-18T05:19:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	you prefer to use bing?
2010-03-18T05:19:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	yes, you need to type:  /server irc.gimp.org
2010-03-18T05:20:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	like I just typed: "ilovethislinuxst: like I just typed: ", but instead of that, I would type: "/server irc.gimp.org"
2010-03-18T05:21:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	oh wait, you're using pidgin?
2010-03-18T05:21:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	and please stop swearing, we can read that.
2010-03-18T05:22:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	it's in the pidgin config/preferences then, you'll need to alter your account settings to go from irc.freenode.net to irc.gimp.org
2010-03-18T05:23:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	you quit.
2010-03-18T05:23:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	do you not know how to use pidgin?
2010-03-18T05:24:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	I had no idea, I don't know you, so I'm not going to assume what your problem is. anyway, I suggest that you try xchat out, it's a bit more intuitive for this level of chat.
2010-03-18T05:25:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	in the free software world, people are in no position to demand anything from anyone, please keep that in mind.
2010-03-18T05:26:00.000Z	Gnea	ilovethislinuxst	I don't care, I'm not seeing a single cent of it, I'm an unpaid volunteer. if you want my help, then please, show some respect and patience.
