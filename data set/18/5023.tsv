2009-01-20T01:03:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	what exactly do you want to do?
2009-01-20T01:04:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	i get asked for a password on each login to authorize the connection to my home network, and it is annoying. In fact, i've used this system for like 10months and this is the first time that i get asked for a password to do that.
2009-01-20T01:05:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	: SSH?
2009-01-20T01:05:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	how are you connecting to the home network
2009-01-20T01:05:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	with the nm-applet... i found it in my session startup applications
2009-01-20T01:05:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	or are you connecting to a windows share?
2009-01-20T01:05:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	no, just my home network..
2009-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	what kind of connection
2009-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	nm-applet --sm-disable thats the command. it is a wifi connection.
2009-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	what is --sm-disable anyway?
2009-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	ahh, so it's asking you for the password when you connect to your wifi?
2009-01-20T01:06:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	don;t know
2009-01-20T01:07:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	well, yes, but i think that it is when that command runs that i get asked for a password.

2009-01-20T01:08:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	is there any place where i can grant the authorization automatically for that application? I saw that post already, but i think that if i downgrade i will get a problem with my fingerprint reader
2009-01-20T01:09:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	i updated pam because the old version needed a press of enter in order to accept the finger swipe as a password
2009-01-20T01:09:00.000Z	lasivian	wolter	no idea to be honest, just trying to point you in the right directions
2009-01-20T01:09:00.000Z	wolter	lasivian	ok, i think ill look it up more
