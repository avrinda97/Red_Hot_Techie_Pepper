2007-07-21T13:36:00.000Z	Taco`		I only hear sound out of one side when in Sound Preferences and testing ALSA but not with OSS, did I break something?
2007-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	try turning the volume down completely in ALSA mixer then back up
2007-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1		It fixes it for me
2007-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	Taco`		Nope, :<
2007-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	: Sorry that fix is for OSS, nvm
2007-07-21T13:41:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	Any fix for ALSA?
2007-07-21T13:41:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	not that I know of, as ALSA doesn't work for me.
2007-07-21T13:41:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	Bleh, :<
2007-07-21T13:42:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	The odd thing is, is that it works -sometimes-.
2007-07-21T13:43:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	: ALSA works for me before the initial kernel update, but after it switches to OSS, and ALSA doesn't work, which is a bummer, since thats the only way I can get sound recording working
2007-07-21T13:44:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	Fixed it! It was something in my .asoundrc file that was screwing it up.
2007-07-21T13:44:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	Why not just select ALSA rather than OSS?
2007-07-21T13:44:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	: It doesn't work
2007-07-21T13:45:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	No output?
2007-07-21T13:45:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	 There isn't an entry, it just gets removed after I update the kernel after initial install
2007-07-21T13:46:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	 Doesn't matter, I've been trying to fix it for 4 months
2007-07-21T13:46:00.000Z	Taco`	MrGreencastl1	So you've tried installing ALSA manually already?
2007-07-21T13:47:00.000Z	MrGreencastl1	Taco`	 Yeah, I've tried almost everything
