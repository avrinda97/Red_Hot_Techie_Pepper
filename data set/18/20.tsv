2005-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	kirkt		aptitude seemed to ignore this, but didnt install either
2005-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	kirkt		can anyone tell me how to reverse the damage?
2005-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	kirkt		"the following packages have unmet dependencies"
2005-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	kirkt		"kde: Depends: kde-core but it is not going to be installed" etc etc
2005-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	kirkt		a list of about 10 of those
2005-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	kirkt		but i can clearly recall aptget downloaded every and each of those
2005-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	kirkt		i'm doing this thru text
2005-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	kirkt		i did a base server-install so i wouldn't need to waste time / HDD installing gnome
2005-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	kirkt		with same error
2005-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	kirkt		arts, kdebase, kdelibs
2005-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	jdub	kirkt	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-base kubuntu-desktop
2005-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	kirkt	jdub	you sure kubuntu is safe ? i heard they have many problems
2005-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	jdub	kirkt	kubuntu is the kde packages
2005-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	kirkt	jdub	i read in a forum that some user did the kde install and it went fine for him
2005-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	kirkt	jdub	however i read in kubuntu forum, that they got still lots of issues
2005-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	jdub	kirkt	if you're installing kde packages from hoary, you are installing kubuntu
2005-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	jdub	kirkt	no, i am just saying it to confuse you (of course it is)
2005-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	kirkt	jdub	see the error ?
