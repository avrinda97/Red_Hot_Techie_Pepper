2008-10-03T02:05:00.000Z	tschlr		same stuff
2008-10-03T02:05:00.000Z	tschlr		I am not sure wether it's the mirrors or our conncetion
2008-10-03T02:06:00.000Z	tschlr		keeps saying 97% [Waiting for headers] [Waiting for headers]                        62B/s 0s

2008-10-03T02:07:00.000Z	tschlr		I tried to google the error and came to some forums etc but that wouldn't help me out much either
2008-10-03T02:07:00.000Z	tschlr		update does not work correctly
2008-10-03T02:07:00.000Z	tschlr		thats what i was trying to say
2008-10-03T02:09:00.000Z	tschlr		JimmyDee; cdrom is already disabled
2008-10-03T02:09:00.000Z	tschlr		i think it has something to do with the multiverse mirrors
2008-10-03T02:09:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	try another mirror? certain sources have problems from time to time.
2008-10-03T02:10:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	it may also be a proxy issue
2008-10-03T02:10:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	try taking out the 'us' at the start of the path on every repo in sources.list
2008-10-03T02:14:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	and? did you update? did it work?
2008-10-03T02:14:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	same error?
2008-10-03T02:14:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	gcc is not installed by default
2008-10-03T02:16:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	install build-essential
2008-10-03T02:19:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	tschlr	is this before you removed the us.*, or did you put it back?
