2005-09-06T05:55:00.000Z	johso		hello, I need help to uninstall/reinstall gtk. anybody up for it?
2005-09-06T05:56:00.000Z	rob^	johso	err why?
2005-09-06T05:56:00.000Z	johso	rob^	because I've installed version 2.8.1, for some reason, and now the two versions are interfering with each other, so I can't install any programs that need gtk...
2005-09-06T05:56:00.000Z	rob^		no gettys == bad
2005-09-06T05:57:00.000Z	rob^	johso	how the heck did you manage that?
2005-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	johso	rob^	I really don't have a clue, been having the problem for some weeks now, I can't even remember why I did it...
2005-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	rob^	johso	did you add any unofficial repos to your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	johso	rob^	yes, a couple..
2005-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	rob^	johso	remove them
2005-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	rob^	johso	then do: sudo apt-get update
2005-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	rob^	johso	then: sudo apt-get upgrade
2005-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	johso	rob^	okay, will do.
2005-09-06T06:02:00.000Z	johso	rob^	any way to check if it works, without installing anything?
2005-09-06T06:04:00.000Z	rob^	johso	the reason your gtk is broken is that you have used unofficial repos, they can break your system as you have done
2005-09-06T06:04:00.000Z	johso	rob^	actually, I think it's because I somehow install gtk 2.8.1... but now I can't rewind.
2005-09-06T06:05:00.000Z	rob^	johso	which is what I just said
2005-09-06T06:06:00.000Z	johso	rob^	heh, fair. but the problem isn't solved: 'pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0' returned 2.8.1, but GLIB (2.6.3)
2005-09-06T06:06:00.000Z	johso	rob^	was found! If pkg-config was correct
