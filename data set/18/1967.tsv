2012-05-25T13:35:00.000Z	vivien_m		This is strange that nvidia-settings see the monitor, but not xrandr. :-()
2012-05-25T13:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 i dont recall xrandr ever working for me with nvidia drivers/twinview
2012-05-25T13:36:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Before Ubuntu 12.04, I was using xrandr all time with nvidia proprietary drivers
2012-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Maybe I was lucky then. I was working all time perfectly for me.
2012-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	dual, rotation, etc.
2012-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Can one write a script with nvidia tools? Like with xrandr?
2012-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 havent really looked into them in ages.
2012-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	So you have a static configuration?
2012-05-25T13:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 yep. i rarely move/remove monitors.
2012-05-25T13:39:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Ok. Static configuration is easy. nvidia tools are good for that. But when you can have different external monitors, this is a different story.
2012-05-25T13:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 twinview changes require a X restart ive seen to work properly. so that may be an issue.
2012-05-25T13:45:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Can you rotate in nvidia-settings? I cannot find the option!
2012-05-25T13:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 i think you can. ive rarely needed to. and with twinvieew you can rotate both monitors or none.
2012-05-25T13:46:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	I deactivated the laptop screen, activate the external monitor. But no rotation option, as far as I can see.
2012-05-25T13:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 no idea then. i rarely rotate. ;) except to read comic books
2012-05-25T13:47:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	Probably Option "RandRRotation" "true" needed in xorg.conf
2012-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	vivien_m	dr_willis	It happens I am still working. ;-) So I prefer the paper shape over the movie shape!
2012-05-25T13:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	vivien_m	 next new feature in monitors will be... Square monitors!
