2008-06-04T04:38:00.000Z	Ademan		is there anything out there that helps windows users get their feet wet with ubuntu in virtualbox?
2008-06-04T04:38:00.000Z	Ademan		or vmware too i guess
2008-06-04T04:39:00.000Z	Ademan		does wubi have that sort of thing?
2008-06-04T04:40:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	installing or just trying out?
2008-06-04T04:41:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	installing.  i have a friend that wants to start developing GUI apps in python, but pygtk support on windows is godawful
2008-06-04T04:44:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	I dunno really, Ubuntu/Debian is pretty easy to install (easier than windows). Just add the required python libs (kde and gtk) and he's good to go.
2008-06-04T04:45:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	oh yeah for sure, it's just he's currently on windows, and i'm trying to figure out the best way to get him ubuntu for development :-)
2008-06-04T04:47:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	So you would like a website to install the basic programming env?
2008-06-04T04:48:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	no, just an easy way to get ubuntu into a vm on his machine, since he's certainly not ready to switch
2008-06-04T04:49:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	Oh, just a vm, im way way off topic then :D
2008-06-04T04:50:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	:-p, well the ULTIMATE goal is just to get him programming using pygtk, but pygtk seems to be horribly broken, or at least a pain on windows (considering how many dependencies gtk+ has, that kind of stuff without a package manager is nothing short of hellish)
2008-06-04T04:53:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	 Yes, you need a package manager. :P
2008-06-04T04:55:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	and pygtk is a mess in linux as it is on windows. it's the same thing
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	? sudo apt-get install python-gtk2
2008-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	Ademan		in fact it's generally already installed since most of ubuntu's nice helper programs are written in using pygtk
2008-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	yes, its easy to install, i just meant the api is still the same ...
2008-06-04T04:59:00.000Z	Ademan	Cubic	oh, i love the api, best way to create GUIs with any language on any platform IMHO
2008-06-04T04:59:00.000Z	Cubic	Ademan	I agree
