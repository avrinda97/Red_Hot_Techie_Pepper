2009-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 do you have any other users for the system that you can get into ?
2009-11-02T15:27:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 I like point and click folks, they keep me employed, I reimage/reinstall and fix busted windows computers all day long. If you are limited to a point and click scope its ok, don't be dissapointed, stick with the masses ! *Grin*
2009-11-02T15:28:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 If you can break the mold, and read some Documentation, you might try booting off the LiveCD and doing password recovery. That will prevent you from having to do a fresh install
2009-11-02T15:30:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 yes, I'm glad they are there, just as I'm glad Roaches exist, so exterminators are employed as well *Grin*... --http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkENYv7kEhg
2009-11-02T15:32:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 check out --> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reset-your-ubuntu-password-easily-from-the-live-cd/
2009-11-02T15:34:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 thats fine, and they can continue to ... And I will continue to collect a paycheck from them, it is the masses being unwilling to learn anything else that feeds my wife and two kids, I'm very thankful for them ;)
2009-11-02T15:35:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 If the world ran Mac's or example, there wouldn't be very much market for me running around fixing simple end user issues :)
2009-11-02T15:35:00.000Z	Tesssa	sponix	i have tried booting to live cd and it didnt work
2009-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 did you follow the steps on howtogeek, booting livecd, mounting the root drive, chroot in, and fix the password on your user ?
2009-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 I'm on a Mac right now (well somewhat)
2009-11-02T15:39:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 I don't mind pointing people in the right directions on *nix systems, its nice for a change of pace, that is why I came in here.. Had 30 minutes to pass while a download finished
2009-11-02T15:44:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	sides Gnea : This is why OpenSolaris has BE (boot environments), where if a build (release) breaks something, you can roll back to the previous one and keep working while you wait for a fix *Grin*
2009-11-02T15:49:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 sorry, I don't buy off on that, nor do I give pitty ... I have faith you can read that article and resolve your user/password issue . And if you can't I'm sure life will continue *Grin*
2009-11-02T15:51:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 unless you run LTS only, you can always expect to encounter a few bumps along the way IMHO, I've been playing with *nix since 95/96, and it has come a _very_ long way toward the "normal user".
2009-11-02T15:53:00.000Z	sponix	Tesssa	 but I look at it this way, you get what you pay for, and the community expects you to give back, in the form of Documentation, helping a friend, bug fixes, error reports, and so forth... That honestly is the price paid for a free OS -- IMHO
2009-11-02T15:55:00.000Z	Tesssa	sponix	i am not that brainy to know anything about how linux works so i wouldnt deem to try leave the to you but dont put people down if they are not as brainy as you
