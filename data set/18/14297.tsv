2007-05-13T10:34:00.000Z	Punkunity		ok ty Flannel
2007-05-13T10:35:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	just install libdvdcss2 and libdvdread, they're essential for playing DVD's .. being able to copy them is just a bonus feature
2007-05-13T10:43:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	you turned on universe and multiverse in synaptic?
2007-05-13T10:50:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	thanks, will take a look.
2007-05-13T10:53:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	as long as one of the packages was libdvdcss2 you should be all set..
2007-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	oh. Ummmm libdvdread ?
2007-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	Not sure what I missed then :)
2007-05-13T10:57:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	not sure if you need w32codecs to play dvd's, but might as well install them too, they're good for lost of other media!
2007-05-22T10:26:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	devede is easiest, qdvdauthor does a better job but is rather complex.
2007-05-22T10:27:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	well, I made some vcd's using it and they came out pretty good. It's very easy to use.
2007-05-22T10:28:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	devede that is, I never tried todiv
2007-05-22T11:10:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	cd Desktop/tovid-0.30
2007-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	cool, if no errors, the next step is 'make' and then 'make install' usually
2007-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	cd ~/Desktop/wherever (I left off ~ last time 'cos you were already there.. now you're not.
2007-05-22T11:21:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	to the txt2whatever thing you just unpacked...
2007-05-22T11:23:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	is there a README.txt ?
2007-05-22T11:26:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	building stuff from sources is usually hard...
2007-06-06T08:06:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Punkunity	tried tremulous yet?
