2006-05-23T16:27:00.000Z	sybariten		i just got an error from a make (of some sort) that it couldnt find SSL library. I have added an ssl switch to the compile instructions manually. But i do have installed openssl, via apt-get. Any place you know i should look for paths?
2006-05-23T16:27:00.000Z	sybariten		its mutt that im trying to make btw, and i'm using dpkg-buildpackage
2006-05-23T16:27:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	have you installed the ssl dev package?
2006-05-23T16:27:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	ah, no, i think not.
2006-05-23T16:28:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	so thats something i am gonna need?
2006-05-23T16:28:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	libssl-dev
2006-05-23T16:28:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	if you are compiling, yes
2006-05-23T16:28:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	ah ok...  any idea what it may be called?
2006-05-23T16:28:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	libssl-dev
2006-05-23T16:29:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	ok thanks! so it has no connection namewise to openssl ?
2006-05-23T16:29:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	I don't think so
2006-05-31T14:12:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	the issue isn't related to PPC, its simply that you have an old version of ubuntu
2006-05-31T14:13:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	eye know ... but _when_ i upgrade that version, there will probably be special cases since i'm on PPC
2006-05-31T14:13:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	I doubt it
2006-05-31T14:39:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	apt-cache search <key>
2006-05-31T14:43:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	need to search locally, for what i have installed .... not for what is available for download
2006-05-31T14:43:00.000Z	NoUse	sybariten	dpkg -l will output all packages and their states
2006-05-31T14:47:00.000Z	sybariten	NoUse	thats what i wanted, thanks!
