2011-07-26T00:02:00.000Z	noman		I have a fresh install of 11.04 on my DM3 HP Notebook. Unfortunately, the graphics don't work and neither does the mic in Skype. I tried installing the ATi driver from ATI's site using sh installer.run but the graphics are still choppy and laggy and it is evident the driver isn't working. I would really appreciate any help regarding this. Thank you.

2011-07-26T00:06:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	iM using the properitary driver under ADDITIONAL DRIVERS and its currently active
2011-07-26T00:06:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	I have rebooted several times, do I still have to restart X?
2011-07-26T00:06:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Ah strange - and you're still getting very bad performance?   Have you restarted X since activating?  Sometimes that can display screwy statuses (i.e. active when it's not)
2011-07-26T00:07:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Oh no
2011-07-26T00:07:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Give me a sec...
2011-07-26T00:07:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	Thank you.
2011-07-26T00:08:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Can you visit this page and select your specific graphics card to verify that fglrx supports it ?  http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx
2011-07-26T00:09:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	Yup, that's the driver that I have.
2011-07-26T00:10:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	And you're on 64bit or 32 ?
2011-07-26T00:10:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Hmm ok
2011-07-26T00:12:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Well - you could try de-activating through the "Additional Drivers" tool and then installing this tool: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
2011-07-26T00:12:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	wait
2011-07-26T00:13:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	Can you run this in a terminal and tell me what it says ?   fglrxinfo
2011-07-26T00:13:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	I tried that first because I had no properitary drivers appearing before. When I installed that, X wouldnt start so I uninstalled that and rebooted and voila I could see properitary drivers which I activated but it was no use
2011-07-26T00:13:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	noman	ah ok.
2011-07-26T00:18:00.000Z	noman	FunnyLookinHat	Thanks :D
