2007-10-22T00:33:00.000Z	garu		what's the main difference between the livecd and the livedvd?does it make any different which one u install?
2007-10-22T00:34:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	dvd comes with more software on it.
2007-10-22T00:34:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	software you can easily install over the internet otherwise
2007-10-22T00:35:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	so, in terms of stability, there is no difference whatsoever?

2007-10-22T00:39:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	it runs slow on my systems, but I have old hardware
2007-10-22T00:39:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	what runs slow?
2007-10-22T00:40:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	sorry, thought you were someone else.  No, there's no reason not to upgrade.
2007-10-22T00:40:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	well, actually, I -upgraded- a feisty system, and it's... problematic.  I did fresh installs on two other systems, and it's smooth sailing.
2007-10-22T00:43:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	I didnt ask anything about upgrading...but anywayz...I had the release candidate before, and then upgraded to the final release.Big Problems
2007-10-22T00:44:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	but now, i got a clean install, they work fine,but, in one of the computer, the only problem I have, is that it keeps asking me if I want to keep X setting for the keyboard, or the Gnome ones
2007-10-22T00:47:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	the other one, it wont even save my key for the wireless networks (gotta type it everytime I start the machine). also, when I'm connected wirelessly, and I start a download, I lose my connection until I restart again
2007-10-22T00:49:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	that's weird.  Both of my clean installs were RC's.
2007-10-22T00:50:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	I still think that they should'v worked a little bit more on it.Its too buggy
2007-10-22T00:51:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	garu	like I said, no problems here.
2007-10-22T00:52:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	that's good. but, considering the amount of people that had problems... :o
2007-10-22T00:52:00.000Z	garu	BHSPitLappy	one thing that shoulnt happen.Everyone that had ubuntu perfectly working on their computer, should still have no problem.lol
