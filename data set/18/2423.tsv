2010-06-02T16:58:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Does Open Office 3.1.1 need more than 1gb memory to run in Karmic?
2010-06-02T16:58:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	at least
2010-06-02T16:58:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	thats just so the splash screen loads... you need 4gb to type words
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Downer.
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	joking, 1gb should be fine
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Odd - it was stable on hardy
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	funkyweasel		But it's unusably flakey
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	but you want 4gb so your not waiting to alt tab
2010-06-02T16:59:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	thats because its made in java
2010-06-02T17:00:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Oh damn, is it because I am using the wrong java?
2010-06-02T17:00:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	no. every java is flakey
2010-06-02T17:00:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Saddening.  Yet OO is stable in every other environment I've tried it in
2010-06-02T17:01:00.000Z	funkyweasel		Is it known to be bad in Karmic?
2010-06-02T17:01:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	its just my opinion, i run openoffice on a atom 280 with 3gbs of ddr3 ram. i can run fine with at least 10 documents open
2010-06-02T17:01:00.000Z	funkyweasel	airtonix	What version, and on which distro please?
2010-06-02T17:02:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	i used it on karmic and lucid. think im using open-office from the ppa
2010-06-02T17:02:00.000Z	airtonix	funkyweasel	openoffice 3.2.0 build 9843
2010-06-02T17:03:00.000Z	funkyweasel	airtonix	That's a good idea.  I've tried totally removing OO and ~/.open-office, reinstalling from repo.  PPA sounds like the next step.
