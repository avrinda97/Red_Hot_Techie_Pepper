2011-05-01T10:29:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	who mentioned wayland?
2011-05-01T10:31:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	someone asked what is wrong with Natty.  So, I mentioned one thing wrong with it.  A bit of a silly answer, but it was a silly question.
2011-05-01T10:32:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	a very silly answer, it implies it's useful at al
2011-05-01T10:36:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	backports in natty would be pretty much empty at this point.  It will only be useful once the Oneiric cycle gets going.
2011-05-01T10:36:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	ehh
2011-05-01T10:40:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	for 11.04, true.
2011-05-01T10:41:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	lets not speculate, and by lets i mean you :]
2011-05-01T10:42:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	no speculation needed.  The official announcement was that Gnome would be removed from 11.10.
2011-05-01T10:42:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	nein
2011-05-01T10:43:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	unless ubuntu is rewriting the 99.99% left that composes their user facing desktop
2011-05-01T10:43:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	gnome is a huge collection of software, which the shell is a small but important part
2011-05-01T10:45:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	Gnome is certainly more than the shell.
2011-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	the vlc in Natty has some serious problems.
2011-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	i'm not interested in anything but specifics
2011-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	good to know, i don't recommend people use vlc anyways ;]
2011-05-01T12:57:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	you can skip that step too
2011-05-01T12:59:00.000Z	ohsix	PythonPup	with 11.04 you don't even have to do that, software-center knows how to enable sources that aren't enabled to get at packages
2011-05-01T13:00:00.000Z	PythonPup	ohsix	OK.  I prefer Synaptic.  But, that is good to know.
