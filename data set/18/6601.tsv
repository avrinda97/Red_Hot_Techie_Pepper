2008-04-26T06:42:00.000Z	cardstroker	rkvirani	I chose VESA, went all through the setup and now I cannot go into gui mode because I get FontPath could not be found error.

2008-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	cardstroker	rkvirani	I just guessed, had to start somewhere and I don't know what is going to happen when I ever actually try to start gui mode.
