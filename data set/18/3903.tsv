2009-07-16T06:45:00.000Z	Andorin		My laptop won't connect to my mother's wireless. It hangs on "Obtaining IP address." Help?
2009-07-16T06:47:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	your not giving alot of info: like does it connect elsewhere... is your mom's AP encrypted; if so, what type of encryption?
2009-07-16T06:47:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	Yes, it normally connects to networks. No encryption.
2009-07-16T06:48:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	are you trying to connect useing encryption (even though the AP isn't encrypted)?
2009-07-16T06:48:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	It also does this with the wireless at a library, and I think someone once said something about "dhcp problem" being the cause.
2009-07-16T06:48:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	No.
2009-07-16T06:48:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	ok... do you have any rules set up in your psk_supplicant file?
2009-07-16T06:49:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	Never accessed it, so I assume no?
2009-07-16T06:49:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	can you request an IP from the AP?
2009-07-16T06:49:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	How would I do that?
2009-07-16T06:50:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	hold on, lemme check
2009-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	when you go to add a network, select Wireless, Add, and go to the IPv4 Settings tab, select Manual in the Method drop and type in "standard" ip that matches the base scheme of the network
2009-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	I know the settings you refer to, but I'm not sure how to access them on my laptop. I normally get there by right-clicking the connection icon in the tray, but the only one there is the wicd icon.
2009-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	right click Panel, add to panel, network manager
2009-07-16T06:56:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	....nope, not listed in the Add to Panel menu.
2009-07-16T07:02:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	erm.. your problem is deeper...
2009-07-16T07:06:00.000Z	Andorin	gartral	so.. what do I do?
2009-07-16T07:14:00.000Z	gartral	Andorin	im not really sure, sorry :/
