2009-08-13T07:21:00.000Z	fynn	BenHagan	what Flash player are you using?
2009-08-13T07:22:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	hang on...
2009-08-13T07:24:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	adobe-flashplugin  10.0.32.18-1
2009-08-13T07:24:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	im running 32 bit
2009-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	the flash stream isn't showing in padevchooser either
2009-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	i think that may be the root of the issue
2009-08-13T07:25:00.000Z	fynn	BenHagan	OK, this should play the sound on most systems...
2009-08-13T07:27:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	sound works for move player
2009-08-13T07:27:00.000Z	fynn	BenHagan	yeah, that's very weird.
2009-08-13T07:27:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	movie*
2009-08-13T07:27:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	yeah thats what i thought
2009-08-13T07:28:00.000Z	fynn	BenHagan	try the forums. in general, I wouldn't expect sound to work while Flash does't. try right-clicking on a movie and seeing if there are any relevant options.
2009-08-13T07:28:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	it's pretty frustrating im also using an audacity but i've never had problems with it before
2009-08-13T07:29:00.000Z	fynn	BenHagan	yeah, flash is the suck. again, try the forums. other than that, maybe try Gnash.
2009-08-13T07:29:00.000Z	BenHagan	fynn	k thanks
