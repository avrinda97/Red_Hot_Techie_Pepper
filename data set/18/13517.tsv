2005-11-19T14:40:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam		Goshawk are you using DHCP or static?
2005-11-19T14:40:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam		Goshawk perhaps thats the problem, why dont you tri static IP
2005-11-19T14:41:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam		try (sorry)
2005-11-19T14:42:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	i used the gnome gui (that edits the /etc/network/interfaces) than when the system reboots it reads the file and try to set the card up... but it can be disconnected, i prefer to configure the network every time that i switch on my pc...
2005-11-19T14:46:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	are you talking with me?... i think yes
2005-11-19T14:47:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	but doing what you say i may load the module every time...
2005-11-19T14:47:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	every time that i wanna configure the netwrok
2005-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam	Goshawk	mmm... there should be another way, let me check
2005-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam	Goshawk	(you are right)
2005-11-19T14:50:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	thanks...
2005-11-19T14:55:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam	Goshawk	i cant find where it is.. but there should be an entry in one of those RC.x, where it tells the system to load the dhcp client daemon, if you cand find it and erease it, you?ll be able to do what yo want to do
2005-11-19T14:56:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	yep
2005-11-19T14:56:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	i can delete the rc script
2005-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	Goshawk	Gdp_usrlam	yep, using upgrade-rc i think... thanks
2005-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam	Goshawk	great!!
2005-11-19T14:57:00.000Z	Gdp_usrlam	Goshawk	hope it works ;)
