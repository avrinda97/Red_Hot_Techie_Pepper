2011-10-22T07:15:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	you still out there.
2011-10-22T07:20:00.000Z	intangir	roasted_	ya but i gotta reboot
2011-10-22T07:20:00.000Z	intangir	roasted_	why whats up, did you figure it out?
2011-10-22T07:22:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	yeah
2011-10-22T07:22:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	turns out ubuntu was kicking me off 3d unity to 2d unity without me realizing
2011-10-22T07:23:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	syslog said "ubuntu" session was failing. When I googled to see how I could tell the difference between 2d and 3d unity, it proved I was in unity 2d anyway. (too many windows open and they fold for 3d, whereas too many windows open and the dock scrolls instead of folders)
2011-10-22T07:23:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	so anyway it was kicking me to 2d without telling me. I found a wiki that confirmed my graphics card had DROPPED support for the newest drivers unless I run an older kernel which has them embedded.
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	intangir	roasted_	im noticing that its apparently not possible to disable the super key on ubuntu 2d
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	intangir		for dash menu...
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	oh, not sure there - I like the super key... whether unity or gnome shell, I use it a lot
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	intangir		oh cool
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	intangir		well my issue is i also use VMs, and everytime i press superkey it pops up BOTH menus
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	intangir		and also when im playing games i dont want dash taking focus
2011-10-22T07:24:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	either way, my graphics card was just dropped. it just confused me since unity and gnome shell are supposed to be equally supported, so I just ept thinking what the crap if unity works why doesnt GS
2011-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	intangir		also it seems to cause a delay issue on any other hotkey that uses super key
2011-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	but knowing I was in unity 2d makes more sense, since thats the 3d fallback, whereas gnome classic is the GS fallback
2011-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	oh wow, thats annoying
2011-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	roasted_	intangir	cant you disable it in the vM?
