2007-02-01T11:07:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	try "grub-install --root-directory=/media/your-ubuntu-partition /dev/your-boot-drive"
2007-02-01T11:07:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	then GRUB won't work, for sure. you need to use the facilities of your current OS
2007-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	you can't. or, well, you can, but you'll be left without GRUB *and* without any other bootloader
2007-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	if you want to restore the *Windows* bootloader, you'll need a Windows CD i believe.
2007-02-01T11:09:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	i don't quite know for sure, not a Windows user. but IIRC, boot from the CD, choose console mode, and "fixmbr" or something (there is a "help" command anyway)
2007-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	if it works, yes. but as i said, i just went by memory, i'm not a Windows user. try ##windows
2007-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	not that i know of.
2007-02-01T11:11:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	of course, you *will* lose stuff if you choose the wrong options from the Windows boot CD
2007-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	LjL	T-ROK	try "grub-install --root-directory=/media/your-ubuntu-partition /dev/your-boot-drive" <-- squeaks, was just suggesting this to someone else (for a different reason)
