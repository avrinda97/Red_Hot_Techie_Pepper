2008-12-21T08:51:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	what are you trying to do?
2008-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	so you are trying to set up a webserver?
2008-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jimjimhim	yes
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	do you have a static IP address?
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	from your ISP? Or is it dynamic?
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jimjimhim	yes
2008-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jimjimhim	from FDCservers.net
2008-12-21T08:54:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	then point it to www on your static IP.  Create an A (DNS Record) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types
2008-12-21T08:54:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	do you have a firewall.. I hope!
2008-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jimjimhim	usually isn't it the case that i go to registrar, add the nameservers, and it will automatically link the www.something.com to my server?
2008-12-21T08:56:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	what nameserver?  Yours?
2008-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	you set up a nameserver?
2008-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	on what? Bind?
2008-12-21T08:58:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	then create an A record for that static IP from your ISP.  Then open up the ports (port forwarding) in your firewall for http (port 80)
2008-12-21T08:59:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	you should go to the server channel
2008-12-21T09:01:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jimjimhim	how do i create A record in zonefile ?
2008-12-21T09:04:00.000Z	jimjimhim	yaris123456789	you need to go to the server channel this is for desktop stuff
