2009-10-21T11:34:00.000Z	jeeaar		hey guys, I've just updated my vaio laptop to jaunty hoping it might finally solve my 3d graphics problem. Pretty much everytime I try to run an openGL app, it crashes or gives me errors. I've tried googling the issue, and have browsed through the wiki, but nothing ive tried seems to fix it. Any ideas?
2009-10-21T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	What GPU?
2009-10-21T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	You had the same problems in 8.10 ?
2009-10-21T11:43:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	so no ideas about openGL for the gma 900?
2009-10-21T11:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	Do you get the same problem running from the jaunty LiveCD?
2009-10-21T11:46:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	Nice idea, not a possibility for me. Broken optical drive :(
2009-10-21T11:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	Do you have a flash drive?
2009-10-21T11:47:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	I could try it, I'm not very privy to this ubuntu stuff - perhaps I should just try to manually install some drivers?
2009-10-21T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	If you are getting the same problem between 8.10 and 9.04 I think it's likely a configuration issue, the intel driver changed a lot from 8.10 to 9.04, so I would expect you to at least have different bugs :)
2009-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	A liveCD is a good baseline, if it works we can look at what's different between the LiveCD and your current system, if it doesn't we know it's just a bad driver and can try other things
2009-10-21T11:54:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	Cool, I intend to try it when I have a chance to make a usb boot key. In the meantime, is there some sudo-apt get magically reinstall graphics drivers command?
2009-10-21T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	No, you can try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" which resets your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but if you haven't changed it manually then it will likely be default already
2009-10-21T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	Can you pastebin the output of "dmesg" and /var/log/Xorg.0.log, preferably right after a freeze?
2009-10-21T11:58:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	sure. Do I want to use the framebuffer kernel interface? :P
2009-10-21T11:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	Keep the default ( I should have told you "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh" which just keeps the defaults and doesn't prompt at all, sorry )
2009-10-21T12:03:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	you want the entire dmesg?
2009-10-21T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jeeaar	Yes, ( do NOT paste it directly to the channel, use pastebin )
2009-10-21T12:09:00.000Z	jeeaar	Jordan_U	and the log file, http://pastebin.com/d52e8d63c
