2008-12-11T14:44:00.000Z	brandan		Is it possible to format a disk without connecting it to the computer or anything because my hard disk is stuck in a verry bad sector and won't boot
2008-12-11T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brandan	no, it needs connecting to a system for power and controling to be formatted
