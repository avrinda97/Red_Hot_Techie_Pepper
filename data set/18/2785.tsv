2010-02-21T22:30:00.000Z	k0dak		anyway. i am trying to install ubuntu on my machine. however, my install CD's wont boot(i have tried 4 now, Ubuntu 64, ubuntu 64-alternate, xubuntu and ye, Mint(i mention it since its based on ubuntu). MD5sum them all, all checked out. tried acpi=off, etc etc
2010-02-21T22:30:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	you md5sum what exactly?
2010-02-21T22:32:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	after you burn, can you see dirs and files on the cd?
2010-02-21T22:32:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	yes, i can
2010-02-21T22:33:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	what does your computer do when you try to boot to the disc?
2010-02-21T22:37:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	sorry, i dc'ed, did i miss anything?
2010-02-21T22:37:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	I just asked what it does when you try to boot to that disc
2010-02-21T22:38:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	so the disc itself is booting, it's just having video issues
2010-02-21T22:38:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	i tried the ubuntu64 text version, same problem
2010-02-21T22:43:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	that's a weird issue.  you might try pressing ctrl+alt+F2 after it seems hung to see if you get in a text console.
2010-02-21T22:44:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	what vid card do you have?
2010-02-21T22:47:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	- im gonna try the alt-ctrl-f2 to see if i get a console up, so leaving chat
2010-02-21T22:56:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	no dice, i tried "check installation medium" when the cd boots, and same problem
2010-02-21T22:57:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	have you tried the alternative install disc?
2010-02-21T22:57:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	ye, same thing
2010-02-21T22:57:00.000Z	k0dak	gsgleason	infact, thats the one i tried now
2010-02-21T22:58:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	I am out of ideas.  It's tough to figure out when not there first hand, you know?
2010-02-21T23:00:00.000Z	gsgleason	k0dak	depends on what filesystem it is already
