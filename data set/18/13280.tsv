2005-12-13T17:15:00.000Z	humandoing		"Error loading Operating System"... yum :|
2005-12-13T17:16:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	a vic20 can *not* be booted with grub ;-)
2005-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	humandoing	Jowi	- but what about my TI-85?
2005-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	perhaps. only tried with TI-89/A. "munchman" is the best game ever.

2005-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	humandoing	Jowi	hah!... maybe you can answer a quick question, I'm quite pleased I backed up all my data :P, but anyways, I managed to get rid of the "Error loading operating system" via XP recovery console (fixboot / fixmbr) now I get an NTLDR error :|
2005-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	humandoing	Jowi	I'm thinking I might try to install Ubuntu _first_ then WinXP... and can I use partition magic or something to load a bootloader for the two?
2005-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	humandoing		any ideas?
2005-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	humandoing		I feel like I'm being violated by a locomotive :P
2005-12-13T17:21:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	i successfully installed XP first and ubuntu after. installed grub on the mbr.
2005-12-13T17:22:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	maybe your grub setup is a bit wierd...
2005-12-13T17:22:00.000Z	Jowi		!grub
2005-12-13T17:22:00.000Z	Jowi		that might help
2005-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	haven't use pqmagic in ages and haven't tried its bootmanager i'm afraid
2005-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	humandoing	Jowi	that's what I did...
2005-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	humandoing		I let it overwrite my MBR, and it proceeded to... um... hurt me.
2005-12-13T17:23:00.000Z	humandoing		I've done this 19 other times, with other Linuxes, and no problems... blech...
2005-12-13T17:24:00.000Z	Jowi	humandoing	yeah, i never had that problem. installed breezy on a laptop dualbooted with winxp the other day. can not help you there i'm afraid.
