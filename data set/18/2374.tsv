2010-09-14T21:36:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	what do you mean wont go away, config files left behind?
2010-09-14T21:38:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	apt-get -f install
2010-09-14T21:40:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	you get same error from command line or it does nothing
2010-09-14T21:41:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	and i assume you did sudo or are root
2010-09-14T21:42:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	also when last time worked correctly
2010-09-14T21:43:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	sorry man - hate to be that guy and say it but google loaded with pages on that msg - i just cant find one that singles out your problem
2011-03-01T05:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	that will put back windows bootmngr but will not have access to ubuntu
2011-03-01T05:51:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	boot win disk if have - choose recovery - then cmd then type bootrec.exe /fixmbr
2011-03-01T05:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	yes all one command
2011-03-01T05:53:00.000Z	bstarek	geoffmcc	but i am planning to reinstall ubuntu from fresh again
2011-03-01T05:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	that command will just get you back into windows - then when you go to install ubuntu will prob have to delete the partitions from old install
2011-03-01T05:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bstarek	easily if u have a ubuntu livecd
