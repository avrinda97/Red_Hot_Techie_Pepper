2007-05-08T15:07:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	k how to fix that?
2007-05-08T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	are you trying to install wine while you're logged in as the first user on your system?
2007-05-08T15:09:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	i dont know....  i installed it today
2007-05-08T15:09:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	i only created one acc
2007-05-08T15:11:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	when you run 'groups', is 'admin' in the list?
2007-05-08T15:13:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	this is what i se adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev powerdev netdev
2007-05-08T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	reboot, and at the boot menu, choose the second option, recovery mode. When it's up, run 'adduser d_star admin' (assuming that d_star is your username).
2007-05-08T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	reboot in normal mode, then you should be able to use sudo.
2007-05-08T15:15:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	 :D thx thats great!
2007-05-08T15:23:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	i got a problem "the group admin does not exist"
2007-05-08T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	this is a fresh installation, isn't it?
2007-05-08T15:24:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	yes it is
2007-05-08T15:24:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	something must have seriously gone wrong during the installation. If it was my system, I would start over and install again.
2007-05-08T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	if that's not an option, you could try creating the admin group, but with a weirdness like this, it's hard to tell what else has gone wrong.
2007-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	isnt adm=Adimin
2007-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	D_STAR	no, the adm group has a different function.
2007-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	D_STAR	soundray	ah ok
