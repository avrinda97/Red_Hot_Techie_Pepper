2007-10-29T16:44:00.000Z	rijo		I get (grub) error 15 when booting my computer. Ubuntu is the only OS i have and it doesnt even help to reinstall ubuntu from scratch. What can be wrong here?
2007-10-29T16:46:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	looks like the kernel image cannot be found (googled from 'grub error 15')
2007-10-29T16:47:00.000Z	rijo	wildman	ye i thought it meant that it cannot find something. But i have no idea what it is and how to fix it since not even reinstalling works
2007-10-29T16:47:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	kernel = the main OS component
2007-10-29T16:47:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	you can think of the kernel as the OS itself :)
2007-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	looks like grub error 15 is like the (in)famous command.com not found error of DOS...
2007-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	rijo	wildman	the funny thing is that if I put in a bootable disk (like a win install cd) and boot. It comes up "Hit a key to start from cd" then if I DONT hit a key. It goes to grub.. and it start ubuntu normally?! :S
2007-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	oups
2007-10-29T16:48:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	is your partition marked as bootable?
2007-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	marked as 'active'
2007-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	rijo	wildman	shud be.. I just took "format whole disk and install ubuntu"
2007-10-29T16:49:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	sudo fdisk /dev/sda then, p to print partition information shuold tell you
2007-10-29T16:52:00.000Z	rijo	wildman	that comman says my cylinders are set to 19457, and that its bigger than 1024
2007-10-29T16:53:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	hum... wait plz
2007-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	it's ok, I have more than 1024 cyls here too, that's handled by the BIOS when you set the disk to LBA as someone suggested above (and as you should have it set)
2007-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	do you see an asterisk (*) by one of the partitions?
2007-10-29T16:54:00.000Z	rijo	wildman	yea
2007-10-29T16:55:00.000Z	wildman	rijo	ok, I guess stefg will keep helping you then
