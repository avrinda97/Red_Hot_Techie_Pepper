2009-01-27T22:49:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	it's a utility that passes any kind of data from one point to another - not good for large installations
2009-01-27T22:50:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	so type it
2009-01-27T22:50:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	are you sure you typed it correctly?
2009-01-27T22:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	could you please pastebin your sources.list?
2009-01-27T22:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	okay, that's a problem. can you open synaptic?
2009-01-27T22:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	okay, what about the software sources?
2009-01-27T22:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Speeder	sounds like something got mistyped at some point. mv /etc/apt/source.list /etc/apt/sources.list  and try to install again
