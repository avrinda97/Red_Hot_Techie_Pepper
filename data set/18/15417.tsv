2005-03-31T17:06:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT		Why does apt.get not work for me?
2005-03-31T17:06:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT		or am i spelling it wrong?
2005-03-31T17:07:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT		oh its apt-get silly meh lol
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT		Ok when  i did apt-get update in normal terminal it said Unable to lock the list directory does this mean i have to do apt-get commands in root?
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	yes, you'll need to do almost any apt-get commands as root
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	thankx
2005-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	anything that needs to modify "the system" needs to be done as root.
2005-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	thankx ill keep that in the back of my head hehe thanks it worked
2005-03-31T17:11:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	if i wanted to update a certain package would it be apt-get upgrade mozila-firefox
2005-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	I think so, yes. I don't use apt-get to update stuff, I use synaptic or aptitude.
2005-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	what do i have to do in synapic i used it yesterday to get universe but apart from that i am null
2005-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	let me have a go then if i get nowhere ill ask you is that alright?
2005-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	I don't have synaptic in front of me, so I can't give you exact instructions, but there is a list of upgradeable packages under the "custom filters" option
2005-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	you just need to right click on it and choose the "upgrade" option
2005-03-31T17:14:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	or press <ctrl>f (or use the menus) to find a specific package
2005-03-31T17:17:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	ok i went to settings>filters>Upgradable <--- out of a list so now?
2005-03-31T17:18:00.000Z	optika	Fl-i-nT	as I said, just right click on the packages you want to upgrade, and choose the upgrade option from the menu.
2005-03-31T17:19:00.000Z	Fl-i-nT	optika	hehe sorry i didnt realize i have the latest version so the option to upgrade wasnt there but yeah thanks anyway now i know how to do it for the future
