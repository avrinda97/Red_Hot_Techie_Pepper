2005-11-07T15:27:00.000Z	thomas		when i install mandriva 2005, it came without a C compiler
2005-11-07T15:28:00.000Z	thomas		but mandriva didn't have apt-get
2005-11-07T15:28:00.000Z	thomas		anyway, mandriva is not a good starting distro
2005-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	thomas		not as good as ubuntu ;)
2005-11-07T15:30:00.000Z	thomas		i know, i used it
2005-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	thomas		as i said, not a good starting distro
2005-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	thomas		IMO
2005-11-07T15:33:00.000Z	thomas		oh, i've another question
2005-11-07T15:34:00.000Z	thomas		i've got a pc downstairs running ubuntu 5.10 with a HP deskjet 930c, and up here i've got kubuntu 5.10 (well, ubuntu with kde installed), how do i share the printer? The pcs are on the same network
2005-11-07T15:36:00.000Z	daaku	thomas	you wanna have a look at cups. iirc, there's http based sharing which is sort of easy to setup and efficient.. try http://localhost:631 to admin cups
2005-11-07T15:37:00.000Z	thomas	daaku	yeah, i've got some kind of menu
2005-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	thomas	daaku	and i can see the printer downstairs from here
2005-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	daaku	thomas	so i guess you're already set :)
2005-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	thomas	daaku	oh wait, thats just a printer i tried to get working, the pc downstiars is off
2005-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	daaku	thomas	i havent used printer sharing in a while, but iirc, setup the printer on the downstairs machine with System->Administration->Printers, and then on the PC setup a new network printer using IPP and the downstairs pc ip and printer name
2005-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	daaku	thomas	the printer name is what you set it to be
2005-11-07T15:44:00.000Z	daaku	thomas	http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.3.2/cups-59/doc/ipp.html#3_1 should be helpful
