2012-03-02T00:21:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	the HDD's from the main desktop?
2012-03-02T00:21:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	 yes
2012-03-02T00:22:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	told it to auto mount, permanent, I rebooted and still...
2012-03-02T00:22:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	you need to install linux additions and then shutdown VM and edit your VM folder options to add Drives as virtual network drives
2012-03-02T00:23:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	on your VM menu there is load VM additions
2012-03-02T00:23:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	I did loaded them but.. btw i've installed linux additions before setting shared folders
2012-03-02T00:24:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	You need to install the Guest additions on the VM run Ubuntu
2012-03-02T00:26:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	otherwise VM Ubuntu wont understand that its running on VM
2012-03-02T00:26:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	i did this: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-utils
2012-03-02T00:27:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	yes, it mounts just a cd
2012-03-02T00:28:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	additions have to be installed on the first desktop and your VM desktop for it to work
2012-03-02T00:29:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	cool now install and restart
2012-03-02T00:31:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	from the virtual cd look for in folder autorun.sh and run to install
2012-03-02T00:31:00.000Z	calico	forever2432	let me check that
2012-03-02T00:33:00.000Z	forever2432	calico	just tested it now again and my shares folders from my host is in /media
