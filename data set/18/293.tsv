2012-10-14T05:19:00.000Z	darryl		hey i have a alienware x-51 and i just installed ubuntu 12.04.1 along side windows 7 but grub doesn't detect windows
2012-10-14T05:19:00.000Z	darryl		also the display is funny, it says its at 1920x1080 resolution but it doesn't fill my screen
2012-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	darryl	you run sudo update-grub in ubuntu
2012-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	darryl	wilee-nilee	i have done that
2012-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	darryl		os-prober doesn't detect windows
2012-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	darryl		i installed ubuntu second
2012-10-14T05:20:00.000Z	darryl		i think its a issue with uefi
2012-10-14T05:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	darryl	easiest way to see the whole setup is using the bootscript. http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
2012-10-14T05:25:00.000Z	darryl		hmm it shows windows boot info in the boot info script thing
2012-10-14T05:29:00.000Z	darryl		ah ha, i think it figured it out
2012-10-14T05:29:00.000Z	darryl		for anyone curious i found a web-page and it says this: It should automatically boot into Ubuntu. If you wish to make it boot into Windows first, simply go into the BIOS and change the Hard Drive BBS priority so Windows Boot Manager comes first.
2012-10-14T05:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	darryl	Post the text from that script in a pastebin
2012-10-14T05:31:00.000Z	darryl		pastebin?
2012-10-14T05:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		!pastebin > darryl

2012-10-14T05:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	darryl	The key to getting tis working is the efi setup, make sure you mention this, I'm not familiar with it.
2012-10-14T05:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		this*
2012-10-14T05:37:00.000Z	darryl	wilee-nilee	yeah thats what i'm thinking, i'm new to efi as well, if it were normal bios i know how to fix it
