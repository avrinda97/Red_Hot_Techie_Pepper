2011-10-01T16:12:00.000Z	hoodoos		hello, guys!
2011-10-01T16:12:00.000Z	hoodoos		i have a problem with core i3 processor when it works fine in live cd in switchable mode(i have 2 video cards) and doesn't work right after install, system always go to black screen :((
2011-10-01T16:13:00.000Z	hoodoos		ubuntu version is 11.04
2011-10-01T16:13:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	thats going to be a video problem not a processor problem
2011-10-01T16:13:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	i already installed kernel 3.0 it didn't help, what can I do? why it works in live cd and doesn't after install?
2011-10-01T16:14:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	try using vesa drivers in the xorg.conf until you get your video drivers installed.
2011-10-01T16:15:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	have you changed to using vesa in xorg.conf and then load the video drives?  What kind of drivers do you have?
2011-10-01T16:15:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	i wonder where can I get drivers for graphics intergrated in core i3
2011-10-01T16:15:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	check this url http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&ProductFamily=Processors&ProductLine=Notebook&ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+Core%e2%84%a2+i3+Mobile+Processor
2011-10-01T16:16:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	i'm currently working on damn crappy descrete nvidia card
2011-10-01T16:17:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	have you checked that url I provided?
2011-10-01T16:17:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	seems like I need to patch kernel to install those firmware?
2011-10-01T16:17:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	I am not sure that is just something I am reading about.  I don't use intel
2011-10-01T16:18:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	I just keep finding results on google and then reading to see if they are useful.
2011-10-01T16:18:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	have you just tried the intel video drivers from the repositories?
2011-10-01T16:19:00.000Z	sivik	hoodoos	The i915 kernel module comes as part of the intel driver (inside the xorg-x11-driver-video rpm)
2011-10-01T16:23:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	well, what ever i try to install from repos (when i do apt-cache search intel) tells me i already have this installed :)
2011-10-01T16:24:00.000Z	hoodoos	sivik	maybe I should dig in some other direction, like compare my curreny config with live cd config?
