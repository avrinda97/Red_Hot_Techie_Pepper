2011-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	sharpK		Hello everyone, Linux infant here. Setting up a basic home server (media streaming/sharing, etc), would Ubuntu Desktop be a more suitable server enviornment to me than the Ubuntu Server considering my very limited experience?
2011-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	most likely, although server will last longer.
2011-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	last longer in what sense?
2011-11-27T06:41:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	release cycle. The desktop is fine plus it comes with a gu.
2011-11-27T08:11:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	yes, although there are other options.
2011-11-27T08:11:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	are any alternatives to SCP or SFTP better for these purposes?
2011-11-27T08:12:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	I have used ssh/scp with sshfs which makes a remote hard drive look like a local one.
2011-11-27T08:12:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	You might want to google 'ubuntu media server'
2011-11-27T08:13:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	How will people be accessing the files?
2011-11-27T08:14:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	There are basically 4 or so windows computers on the network, I have a 5th computer with ubuntu installed and want it to act as a home server so that the windwos computers can stream media/music off of it, store (hopefully incremental) backups and other files, among other home server functions...
2011-11-27T08:15:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	There is samba, which lets you share a drive as on a windows network.
2011-11-27T08:15:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	right, I just installed it, and like i said above, it opens up, asks for a password, I enter it, and it goes away
2011-11-27T08:15:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	is it possible that samba is bugged on 10.10?
2011-11-27T08:16:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	what do you mean? It should just start the samba service and then other computers can access your computer.
2011-11-27T08:17:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	what is the windows computer error?
2011-11-27T08:18:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	windows cannot access \\Server\share --- check the spelling of the name...blahblah...
2011-11-27T08:18:00.000Z	melkor	sharpK	If you haven't configured it yet, you might not have a directory available.
2011-11-27T08:18:00.000Z	sharpK	melkor	I'll read up and look at it
