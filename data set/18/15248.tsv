2005-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	majic		I've had 5.04 on my machine for a week and my update manager is still saying there are no updates. Are there really no updates? (I find that very strange if true)
2005-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	that is true
2005-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	hoary is now only getting security and major bugfixes
2005-08-06T16:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	there is a bug filed about it
2005-08-06T16:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	they are looking at solutins
2005-08-06T16:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	Ubuntu does not update stable releases with new versions of applications
2005-08-06T16:15:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	but the version they picked was broken and only released for 3 days
2005-08-06T16:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	this issue is well known and they are evaluated options

2005-08-06T16:22:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	I don't see why somebody hasn't updated the package from the current 1.8.2 release. Having just switched over from Gentoo I don't see why it's that big of a deal, or maybe it is. I'm sure the package would not have changed much since it just incorporates some bug fixes.
2005-08-06T16:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	basically the policy is no new versions, because if they break things, you have bad news
2005-08-06T16:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	did you read the comment from Sebastian Bacher on that bug?
2005-08-06T16:23:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	I didn't see his comments in that link
2005-08-06T16:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	sorry by mdz
2005-08-06T16:24:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	yeah, I read those.
2005-08-06T16:25:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	if I knew how to build packages I'd attempt to fix the problem.
2005-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	majic	pbuilder questions are probably better asked in #ubuntu-motu
2005-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	majic	Burgundavia	thanks
