2007-11-17T14:33:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	i learned about screen today too... but i've been using yakuake so screen is not THAT great for me
2007-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	whats yakuake?
2007-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	a quake like terminal
2007-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	I'm satisfied with the non-shaky version of terminal:)
2007-11-17T14:35:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	is it like tty?
2007-11-17T14:35:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	it is like a regular terminal, but it is dropdown, and you can have many open in the same window (kinda like konsole, but w/o tabs)
2007-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	well, I decided to go hardcore and not load the ubuntu GUI at all, so everything is from bash. No windows:)
2007-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	haha, kewl!
2007-11-17T14:38:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	yep, I just wanna see how long I can live with it:D
2007-11-17T14:38:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	bitchx + finch + mpg321 + lynx... what else do you need? lol
2007-11-17T14:39:00.000Z	greencookie	leo_rockw	hm I used to have lynx but now its replaced by elinks, instead of mpg321 I got sox, but whats bitchx and finch?
2007-11-17T14:40:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	yeah, irc. i never tried irssi or bitchx
2007-11-17T14:40:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	finch is good tho
2007-11-17T14:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	i tried elinks and didn't like it. i'll have to try sox
2007-11-17T14:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw	greencookie	bitchx is just another irc app
