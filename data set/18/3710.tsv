2009-08-14T08:59:00.000Z	jda2000		If I install Ubuntu on an IMac g3, Will I still be able to set the Power-on time for the box?
2009-08-14T08:59:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	like uptime?
2009-08-14T09:00:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	I mean the time that the box will power up by itself.
2009-08-14T09:01:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	oh you mean like a scheduled boot up?
2009-08-14T09:01:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Yes.
2009-08-14T09:01:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	should be able to
2009-08-14T09:01:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Cool, Do you know the package that can do it?
2009-08-14T09:02:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	linux by default has a function, IIRC
2009-08-14T09:03:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	If I recall correctly lol
2009-08-14T09:04:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	it's a phrase abbreviation
2009-08-14T09:05:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Ok, I found IIRC.        --- is there an API or app to set the auto power-up time?
2009-08-14T09:06:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	built in I think, haven't used it, google it
2009-08-14T09:07:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Hmmm...   That's how I started....
2009-08-14T09:08:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	IRC was my last hope.
2009-08-14T09:08:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	don't really know, never used scheduled startup
2009-08-14T09:09:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Is there a nice place to go to browse the kernel source?
2009-08-14T09:10:00.000Z	Berzerker	jda2000	not the best person to ask lol
2009-08-14T09:12:00.000Z	jda2000	Berzerker	Thanks.  Bye.
