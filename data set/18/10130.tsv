2007-08-25T08:00:00.000Z	javaJake		Gaim and AOL had an agreement of some kind a while back too that was supposed to settle this, but AOL somehow squeezed around it
2007-08-25T08:02:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	I use GAIM; how do I send a file to you? Not that I want to, I just want to know how :-)
2007-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	In IM window, the menu Conversation -> Send File
2007-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	in the IM window?
2007-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	in Gaim?
2007-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	you have to actually open an IM with someone to transfer a file
2007-08-25T08:04:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	Well, I have a menu item "Conversation", another "Options" and a greyed out one "Send to". Under "Conversations" there is no "Send file". I'm not sure it's the "IM window" though, it's the window this conversation is appearing in...
2007-08-25T08:05:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	OK, how do I start an IM with someone in GAIM?
2007-08-25T08:05:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	in the conversation window is what I meant
2007-08-25T08:06:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	Ah - if I right-click their name in the names list on the right, I get a mini-menu, and send file is on it.
2007-08-25T08:06:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	you must be using a different version of Gaim - I don't get that. :P
2007-08-25T08:07:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	IN help about I get "GAIM 2.0.0beta6", it came as part of Feisty.
2007-08-25T08:07:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	Huh, same version as me. :P
2007-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	kauer	javaJake	In my "main window" I see this conversation. To the right is a narrow vertical pane containing the nicks of all those on this channel at the moment. If I right click on a name in that list, I get "IM", "Send file", "Ignore", "Info", "Add" and "Last Said" as options. I'm about to try sending you a (harmless, text) file as an experiment.
2007-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	oh oh oh
2007-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	lol
2007-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	you are using Gaim in IRC. I get it now
2007-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	javaJake	kauer	i mean, swap that - using IRC in Gaim
