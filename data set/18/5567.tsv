2008-09-26T17:39:00.000Z	kunim_		is there a proper way to get anti-aliased fonts with google earth? i tried using the system qt but that breaks images in the popups (just a gray box is shown).
2008-09-26T17:39:00.000Z	kunim_		(so for example is there a specific qt version that might work?! or another trick?!)
2008-09-26T17:41:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	i use the Google Earth from Medibuntu, and the fonts are anti-aliased... the AA is pretty bad, but it's there
2008-09-26T17:43:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	hmm ok i'll try the mediabuntu version. used the "package builder"-version from multiverse(?)
2008-09-26T17:44:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	but you use ge 4.3 not 4.2, right?
2008-09-26T17:45:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	it's 4.3, yes
2008-09-26T17:47:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	did you change any settings? because the medibuntu version just shows plain fonts here not anti-aliased ones :(
2008-09-26T17:47:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	well, i don't think i changed anything from inside google earth... but i'm on KDE, for a start
2008-09-26T17:50:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	hmmmm.. :(
2008-09-26T18:04:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	mind to pastebin your ~/.config/Trolltech.conf ?
2008-09-26T18:07:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	sure, moment

2008-09-26T18:07:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	thanks
2008-09-26T18:09:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	still no luck :(
2008-09-26T18:10:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	*shrug* i can post a screenshot i suppose
2008-09-26T18:12:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	http://img244.imageshack.us/my.php?image=93189390oe8.png looks like bad antialiasing, but antialiasing, to me
2008-09-26T18:13:00.000Z	LjL	kunim_	i have a CRT so it's admittedly hard to tell for sure
2008-09-26T18:18:00.000Z	kunim_	LjL	yes, looks anti-aliased .. .very strange :(
