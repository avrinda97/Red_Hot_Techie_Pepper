2006-04-20T08:39:00.000Z	zido		is there a apt package for wine?
2006-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	mwe	zido	sudo apt-get install wine
2006-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	mwe	zido	enable !universe though
2006-04-20T08:40:00.000Z	zido	mwe	can't find the package (yes, i've un-commented the universe packages)
2006-04-20T08:41:00.000Z	mwe	zido	maybe you need to sudo apt-get update first
2006-04-20T08:41:00.000Z	zido	mwe	all done
2006-04-20T08:41:00.000Z	mwe	zido	can you paste your sources.list to pastebin.com?
2006-04-20T08:44:00.000Z	zido	mwe	http://pastebin.com/661511
2006-04-20T08:45:00.000Z	mwe	zido	I'd comment line one with the cd and remove the no. part for your mirrors. using archive.ubuntu.com directs you to a good mirror
2006-04-20T08:48:00.000Z	zido	mwe	i get an error that it's not avalible, but another package is pointing to it, so it can be that the package is missing, out of date or just avalible from another source
2006-04-20T08:49:00.000Z	mwe	zido	odd. you sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install wine and it says not available?
2006-04-20T08:49:00.000Z	mwe	zido	weird
2006-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	zido	mwe	yeah, i would think they'd have wine in apt :(
2006-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	mwe	zido	it's there
2006-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	mwe	zido	i installed it
2006-04-20T08:51:00.000Z	zido	mwe	where :)
2006-04-20T08:52:00.000Z	mwe	zido	I just enabled universe and typed sudo apt-get install wine
2006-04-20T08:54:00.000Z	zido	mwe	i can find xwine, but it doesn't really work without wine itself :)
