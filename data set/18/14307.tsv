2005-10-18T16:14:00.000Z	sockpuppe1		im updating now because the way things are lopoking the servers will be swamped with requests for breezy tomorrow
2005-10-18T05:17:00.000Z	sockpuppe1		ok folks ive just installed breezy
2005-10-18T05:18:00.000Z	sockpuppe1		but when I rebooted i see grub with hoary and breezy
2005-10-18T05:18:00.000Z	sockpuppe1		te kernel for oary and breezy I mean
2005-10-18T05:19:00.000Z	sockpuppe1		and when I select breezy, kubuntu's screen pops up while grub is loading
2005-10-18T05:19:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	?
2005-10-18T05:20:00.000Z	sockpuppe1	theine	what didn't you understand (not trying to be a prick just trying to understand if im not being clear enough)
2005-10-18T05:21:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	what do you mean grub is loading while the ubuntu screen pops up?
2005-10-18T05:22:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	but that's what you said, no?
2005-10-18T05:23:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	I don't think it's grub that's loading in this case but the linux kernel
2005-10-18T05:23:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	anyway, what's the exact problem you're having?
2005-10-18T05:26:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	i'm a bit confused i'm afraid... you see breezy and hoary in the grub menu, and that's a problem because?
2005-10-18T05:28:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	so can you actually boot into breezy?
2005-10-18T05:29:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	but you can't boot into your old hoary installation?
2005-10-18T05:29:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	so you're just wondering why the hoary boot entries still show up?
2005-10-18T05:30:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	probably because you still have the old kernel image from hoary installed
2005-10-18T05:30:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	search for `linux-image' in synaptic
2005-10-18T05:31:00.000Z	theine	sockpuppe1	if you remove the hoary image? no, it's safe to remove if the breezy image works
