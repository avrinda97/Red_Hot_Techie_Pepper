2007-04-20T05:00:00.000Z	magnetron	eternaljoy	i use 2GB swap, to be on the safe side ... =)
2007-05-26T15:47:00.000Z	eternaljoy	magnetron	why?
2007-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	magnetron	eternaljoy	the desktop cd just contains the most common install options
2007-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	eternaljoy	magnetron	yeah true!  and the desktop wouldnt install for me at all, but when I tried the  the alternate disk it installed fine
2007-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	magnetron	eternaljoy	depends on your hardware config
2007-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	eternaljoy	magnetron	yeah, its relative

2007-05-27T16:06:00.000Z	eternaljoy	magnetron	I didnt ask for any recommendations or links. I asked "has anyone here got BattleField 2141 to run and work on Fesity just using Wine?"
