2006-05-04T09:26:00.000Z	XiXaQ		If I install 5.04, is it possible to update the system to 5.10 or 6.06 automatically while the system is running?
2006-05-04T09:27:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	yes, but it will require a reboot
2006-05-04T09:27:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	but will it require manual configuration on my part?
2006-05-04T09:27:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	a couple clicks...
2006-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	ok. The installation cd seems to be incompatible with my system you see. But I know that 5.04 works, cause I installed it once.
2006-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	what do you mean incompatible?
2006-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	DBO		didnt we work on this one?
2006-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	well it doesn't work. :)
2006-05-04T09:28:00.000Z	DBO		what goes wrong?
2006-05-04T09:29:00.000Z	DBO		its not
2006-05-04T09:29:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	when I try to install, it seems to go into an infinite loop when setting up primary installation repository or something?
2006-05-04T09:30:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	ok, so you want to install hoary and update to breezy (and in a month or so, dapper)
2006-05-04T09:30:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	it keeps saying that my locale is up to date, and that nothing is downloaded, updated, removed or installed. Then it sais the same thing about iso-something and then it goes back to the locale again.
2006-05-04T09:31:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	I want to have ubuntu on my harddrive. Running an os from a cd is not very efficient you know. :)
2006-05-04T09:31:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	yeah, for hoary to update you have to modify your sources.list to says breezy instead of hoary
2006-05-04T09:31:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	rumor has it that dappers update will update the sources.list automatically
2006-05-04T09:32:00.000Z	XiXaQ	DBO	how stable is dapper? Perhaps I should download the installation cd for that first?
2006-05-04T09:32:00.000Z	DBO	XiXaQ	its stable, but updates do break things from time to time, and some people have hosed boxes that way
