2006-12-10T06:32:00.000Z	Briar3os		Hello.
2006-12-10T06:33:00.000Z	Briar3os		Apparently, that application is not in my "PATH", whatever that means.
2006-12-10T06:35:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	i have to do a `rehash` if i  just install something
2006-12-10T06:35:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	i use zsh as my shell
2006-12-10T06:35:00.000Z	Briar3os		Oh-kay...
2006-12-10T06:35:00.000Z	Briar3os		To be more precise, I'm trying to use Ark to unpack things...
2006-12-10T06:36:00.000Z	Briar3os		"/usr/share/doc/bash/completion-contrib/unrar"
2006-12-10T06:38:00.000Z	Briar3os		_osh?
2006-12-10T06:40:00.000Z	Briar3os		If you know of a better option, let me know.
2006-12-10T06:41:00.000Z	Briar3os		So, what's the difference with nonfree? Commercial?
2006-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	the commercial is close source
2006-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	rar is free-as-in-beer
2006-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	Briar3os		Mm-kay...
2006-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	you are new to the whole open source seen i take it :D
2006-12-10T06:42:00.000Z	Briar3os		This is just a temporary thing...
2006-12-10T06:43:00.000Z	my_haz	Briar3os	sudo apt-get install rar && rar x mypr0n.rar
2006-12-10T06:43:00.000Z	Briar3os		I just happened to find out that all my OS X installation discs were faulty, one way or the other.
2006-12-10T06:43:00.000Z	Briar3os	my_haz	I'm fairly sure I don't appreciate that last part... :-)
