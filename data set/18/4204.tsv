2009-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	boingba		hello
2009-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	boingba		does anyone know about gvfs?
2009-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	are you having a problem or something?  gvfs is how gnome integrates multiple file system types into Nautilus, the file manager
2009-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	can i kill it?
2009-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	why do you want to?
2009-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	are you having mounting problems or something?
2009-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	if you are, there is a better way to resolve it
2009-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	im trying to make ubuntu lean and mean
2009-05-19T08:01:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	i am trimming processes which i do not need.
2009-05-19T08:01:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	i am trimming processes which i do not need so i could get the best performance
2009-05-19T08:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	honestly, i wouldn't do that.  its just way to useful for me.  if you kill gvfs, you lose all the functionality of nautilus
2009-05-19T08:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	if that is even possible
2009-05-19T08:01:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	ohhhh, so like the automount thing that nautilus does?
2009-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	if you're trying to improve performance, it would be better to research what kind of tweaks you can perform in gconf, or use a different gui type thing, like xfce
2009-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	boingba	yes.
2009-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	hmmm i dont need any of that. i am using openbox
2009-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	i literally see a black screen on startup :)
2009-05-19T08:03:00.000Z	boingba	rdw200169	any cluse how i can prevent gvfs from loading?
