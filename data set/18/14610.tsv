2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	did you run sudo wine at some point or something?
2007-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	if so the perms of .wine could be skewed
2007-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	wasabi__	mwe	oh hmm yea i usually run sudo wine
2007-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	dont't ;)
2007-02-15T15:04:00.000Z	wasabi__	mwe	hah okay. i will try it again
2007-02-15T15:05:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	as normal user chown -R $(whoami) ~/.wine
2007-02-15T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	actually chown -R $(whoami).$(whoami) ~/.wine
2007-02-15T15:07:00.000Z	wasabi__	mwe	awesome! thank you
2007-02-15T15:07:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	I take it it's working now? ;)

2007-02-15T15:08:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	good ;)
2007-02-15T15:09:00.000Z	wasabi__	mwe	btw what's a lite bt client native to linux that has a low memory footprint? i've tried transmission but i find that it's banned on some tracker
2007-02-15T15:10:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	bittorrent I think. I don't use it much, though
2007-02-15T15:10:00.000Z	wasabi__	mwe	okay thanks. i will look into it
2007-02-15T15:10:00.000Z	mwe	wasabi__	or bittorrent-gui maybe
