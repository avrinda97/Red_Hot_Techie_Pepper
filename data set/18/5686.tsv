2012-05-29T01:12:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	hosting 90GB of binaries is a drop in the bucket
2012-05-29T01:12:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	It's not that that I care about, it's the speed...
2012-05-29T01:12:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	in general I agree, though, p2p is a great idea that isn't utilized nearly as much as it could be
2012-05-29T01:13:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	Yeah, I'm in the middle of nowhere in the UK, so my internet is crap.  Trying to download all 110MB of wine is sloooowwwww....
2012-05-29T01:14:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	torrenting wouldn't necessarily help
2012-05-29T01:15:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	It does actually, it takes me 40 minutes to download a 780mb iso off of bittorrent, as far as http it takes like 6 hours.
2012-05-29T01:16:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	that may be true, but it's not a matter of http vs bittorrent, just a matter of the specific http mirror you're using
2012-05-29T01:16:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	I get as close as I can, either the dutch servers or the french.
2012-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	where're you?
2012-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	belg-y-am?
2012-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	Cambridge, UK
2012-05-29T01:20:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	really... surely there are closer mirrors than france and nederlands
2012-05-29T01:20:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	Depends on where the distro is based, but for most of the larger distros there aren't.
2012-05-29T01:21:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	Wasn't just talking about ubuntu.  I' just set up 10 different distros on a pen drive.
2012-05-29T01:22:00.000Z	reisio	nkei0	still hard to believe, name me a distro
2012-05-29T01:26:00.000Z	nkei0	reisio	I don't remember, I just d/l'd arch, lubuntu, xubuntu, ubuntu, puppy, fedora, crunchbang, and a ton of others.
