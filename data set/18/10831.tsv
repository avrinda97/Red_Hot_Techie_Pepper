2007-04-01T08:40:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	I'm trying to comprehend your pastebin, sounds like a mis-configuration, what is the output of "pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0" ?
2007-04-01T08:41:00.000Z	larsemil	fnf	http://www.pastebin.ca/419643
2007-04-01T08:44:00.000Z	larsemil	fnf	did you look?
2007-04-01T08:44:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	I'm searching for that weird flags
2007-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	try to compile a small/blank C++ source with verbose enabled
2007-04-01T08:45:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	that wasn't the problem of gtk lib
2007-04-01T08:47:00.000Z	larsemil	fnf	 how do i do verbose?
2007-04-01T08:47:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	put the "-v" option in your compile command
2007-04-01T08:48:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	it should expand all the compile options

2007-04-01T08:51:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	these errors just disappear, did you verify that the source file is correct ?. The tutorials might be built for older gcc versions, which won't be compatible with gcc4.1
2007-04-01T08:51:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	the gtktest file I meant
2007-04-01T08:54:00.000Z	larsemil	fnf	well its the newest i can find. and it seams more like its the pkg-config that doesnt work. ah well. i'll learn gtk some other day
2007-04-01T08:55:00.000Z	fnf	larsemil	alright, quite unfortunate that I don't have the gtk lib readily available
2007-04-01T08:55:00.000Z	larsemil	fnf	 thanx anyway
