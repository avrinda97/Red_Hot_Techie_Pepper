2006-09-29T12:46:00.000Z	wetduck		I am having problem with sudo. If I type sudo on terminal the following line apears: wetduck is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported. Does anybody have an idea about what could be possibly hapening please?
2006-09-29T12:46:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	are you in the admin group?
2006-09-29T12:47:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	do you have administrative access to the box?
2006-09-29T12:48:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	yes.
2006-09-29T12:49:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	usermod -G admin -a wetduck
2006-09-29T12:50:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	if you can't sudo though, you'll need root access or someone else in the admin group to add you
2006-09-29T12:52:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	usermod: unable to lock password file
2006-09-29T12:52:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	like I said, you'll need someone in the admin group to issue that command
2006-09-29T12:52:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	what username did you enter when you installed?
2006-09-29T12:53:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	but I am supposed to be the admin group :oP
2006-09-29T12:54:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	try "grep admin /etc/group" and see who _is_ in the admin group
2006-09-29T12:55:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	I got lpadmin:x:106:wetduck
2006-09-29T12:56:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	and you didn't enable the root account?
2006-09-29T12:56:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	if not, you'll have to booth the livecd to fix it
2006-09-29T12:56:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	Mmmm not sure, how?
2006-09-29T12:56:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	boot*
2006-09-29T12:57:00.000Z	wetduck	orion2012	what does that line says?
2006-09-29T12:59:00.000Z	orion2012	wetduck	boot the livecd, it should automount your hard drive. then you can edit /etc/group by hand and add your username after admin:x:112:
