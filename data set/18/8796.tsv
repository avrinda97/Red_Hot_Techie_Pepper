2007-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	simpleH		Hi, I'm having a problem with my Asus laptop's nvidia drivers
2007-06-22T15:00:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	What is the problem?
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	simpleH		umm, as far as I can tell I'm using legacy drivers for a go7600
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	Is this feisty?
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	simpleH		yeah
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	Did you get them ouit of the restricted driver manager?
2007-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	simpleH		the big problem here is my screen resolution is limited to 1024x768
2007-06-22T15:02:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	Install the nvidia control center (I can't remember the package name) and run it as root. You can change the resolution from there
2007-06-22T15:02:00.000Z	simpleH		originally, I did, but then I followed a guide on how to install the latest desktop version for my card series, and it seems nothing changed
2007-06-22T15:02:00.000Z	simpleH		oh, how do I enter it? I should have it installed
2007-06-22T15:03:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	"sudo nvidia-settings"
2007-06-22T15:07:00.000Z	simpleH		ok, I restarted X and rebooted
2007-06-22T15:08:00.000Z	simpleH		and I'm looking at the FixVideoREsolutionHowto site
2007-06-22T15:08:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	Run "sudo nvidia-settings"
2007-06-22T15:09:00.000Z	rbs-tito	simpleH	There will be a screen, or display section, sometimes you can change the resolution manually from there
2007-06-22T15:09:00.000Z	simpleH		awesome, native resolution now
2007-06-22T15:10:00.000Z	simpleH	rbs-tito	thanks
2007-06-22T15:11:00.000Z	simpleH	rbs-tito	I have another question....when I bought this laptop, I had to find out the hard way that nvidia didn't directly support my card, and it's supported through Asus, which is somewhat notorious for their poor support....I have done this in the past, installing desktop drivers for this laptop card, and it's always run fine, the question is....is there any real problem with doing this?
