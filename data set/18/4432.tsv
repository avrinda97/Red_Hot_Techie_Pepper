2009-06-08T20:01:00.000Z	DanDan		ah Dr_willis : thnx .. :) ... I just want to know one more thing .. how can I know which packages belong to that debian repo ??
2009-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	If you're having trouble with flash, try downloading the deb package from adobe.com and installing that. (of course, uninstall any flash packages that you get from the repos before doing this)
2009-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: my problem is way far from just installing another Flash package .. I have tried everything nothing seems to fix that broken package
2009-06-08T20:03:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	If you've mixed Debian packages with Ubuntu, it's best that you reinstall.
2009-06-08T20:04:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: no other solution :( ? I'll have to get an external HD and like BACK UP everything lol !
2009-06-08T20:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	It's a complicated system - there are lots of dependencies between packages, etc. Not worth the hassle if you're not technically skilled enough.
2009-06-08T20:06:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: oh well ... thanks :) I'll get that External now I guess
2009-06-08T22:42:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	No.
2009-06-08T22:43:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	Only the Core Duo/Core 2 Duo line is 64 bit I believe.
2009-06-08T22:43:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: is there a command I can add to the terminal to know ?
2009-06-08T22:44:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	sudo lshw -C Processor
2009-06-08T22:47:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: thnx :) .. thats funny the attached stamp on the laptop is intel centrino duo but in the terminal Inter core .. 64bit
2009-06-08T22:47:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	What laptop do you have?
2009-06-08T22:48:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	That's a Core 2 Duo. :P
2009-06-08T22:50:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	I don't see any reason why you can't.
2009-06-08T22:51:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	That's all right - is this going to be your first time trying out Ubuntu?
2009-06-08T22:52:00.000Z	DanDan	tiyowan	: no I started using it with Feisty Release .. :$
2009-06-08T22:53:00.000Z	tiyowan	DanDan	np - topgun21's suggestion is commendable.
