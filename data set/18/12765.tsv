2009-10-11T00:21:00.000Z	quellhorst		I jsut installed the 32bit version of ubuntu server. I didn't know it came with a gui?
2009-10-11T00:21:00.000Z	quellhorst		also on my 32bit server install, its only seeing 3 gigs of my 3 gigs of ram.
2009-10-11T00:22:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	it's a limit of 32bit os
2009-10-11T00:22:00.000Z	quellhorst	ratboy	so can I upgrade my 32bit install to be 64bit?
2009-10-11T00:22:00.000Z	quellhorst		i couldn't get the 64bit iso to boot via usb stick
2009-10-11T00:23:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	more likely you'll need clean install
2009-10-11T00:23:00.000Z	ratboy		i've got 8gb ram
2009-10-11T00:24:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	i've got 8gb
2009-10-11T00:24:00.000Z	quellhorst	ratboy	yeah, sure I'd upgrade this machine, but i got ram when it was > $150 per 1gig stick :)
2009-10-11T00:25:00.000Z	quellhorst		still sux that I couldn't boot from 64bit iso
2009-10-11T00:25:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	i've loaded 64bit , no problems
2009-10-11T00:26:00.000Z	quellhorst	ratboy	sure, but I either have to go buy a dvd ide drive, dvd usb drive, or find out why the 64bit server image wont boot
2009-10-11T00:27:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	but i had to use that alternative cd - because of the fake raid0
2009-10-11T00:27:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	well , i've newer loaded the server version, so can't tell
2009-10-11T00:30:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51093/ubuntu-32-bit-maximum-address-space
2009-10-11T00:31:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	 server install should support PAE and see all ram
2009-10-11T00:32:00.000Z	quellhorst	ratboy	its weird because I have 4096 gigs, i would think thats still under the limit
2009-10-11T00:33:00.000Z	ratboy	quellhorst	i think that real limit is ~3.3gb , its all to do with marketing , etc .. lol
