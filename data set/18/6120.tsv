2008-06-27T04:05:00.000Z	zilda		how do I change the language at login time? I have the additional language packs installed but I still don't see anything that would allow me to specify a different language on gdm. Any info is appreciated
2008-06-27T04:06:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	looked at the system, administration, login window dialog? might be something there
2008-06-27T04:07:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	I don't have anything like that.
2008-06-27T04:07:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	The pages that I've seen so far suggest that there is a language selector somewhere on gdm, but I don't see it....
2008-06-27T04:08:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	hmm.. hang on.. let me get my laptop and I'll take a look
2008-06-27T04:08:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	Thanks. By the way, I'm on hardy heron
2008-06-27T04:11:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	I have a language button on my login window.. next to the session and actions buttons
2008-06-27T04:12:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	I don't see them. I'm starting to think that gdm is on one resolution while gnome itself is on another.
2008-06-27T04:12:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	This is a laptop and I have never used ubuntu before, though I'm familiar with Linux
2008-06-27T04:12:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	try using another gdm theme.. perhaps not all themes show the buttons
2008-06-27T04:12:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	Good idea!
2008-06-27T04:12:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	Let m give it a shot and see what happens
2008-06-27T04:13:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	I'll have to leave the channels for a few minutes as I'm running out of battery. Will try your suggestion and then I'll come back to let you know.
2008-06-27T04:13:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	Thanks a bunch!!!
2008-06-27T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	I'm using the "Bijou" theme
2008-06-27T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	you found it?
2008-06-27T04:14:00.000Z	Slart	zilda	ah.. ok.. see you later
2008-06-27T04:14:00.000Z	zilda	Slart	Bye!
