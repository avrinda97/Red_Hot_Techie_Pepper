2005-06-22T11:29:00.000Z	pinko		is there a particular debian package for openssh-server?
2005-06-22T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	yes, openssh-server
2005-06-22T11:30:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	in sarge it was part of the ssh package
2005-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	you don't have to do anything aside from install the openssh-server package
2005-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	if you have a "firewall" between you and the world, you'd of course need to configure that, too
2005-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	firewall is not the problem, though I'm trying to make it work with a forwarded port
2005-07-14T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	then it is the problem
2005-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	I think you're right.  any advice?
2005-07-14T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	assuming it's a consumer "router" thing, none other than reading the manual to find out how to forward connections
2005-07-14T11:40:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	I have the port opened by my gateway, verified that it's open through scan.sygate.com
2005-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	that site sounds useless
2005-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	can you ssh to your external ip from elsewere on the internet or not?
2005-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	nope.  so far, I can only do it from within the network
2005-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	then the router is still misconfigured
2005-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	I assume this is the ip you're on irc from?
2005-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	yes
2005-07-14T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	pinko	it works fine
2005-07-14T11:45:00.000Z	pinko	bob2	thank you.  I think I can guess what the trouble is, then.
