2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	notwist		!ask | Tyr
2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	jcase		but i dont want someone to log in
2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	notwist	jcase	no need. even if nobody logs in ssh daemon should start when the boot process is complete
2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	jcase		ok
2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	jcase		thats what i wanted to make sure of
2009-02-20T03:35:00.000Z	notwist	jcase	just for security however you should configure your firewall to drop ssh traffic from certain ips
2009-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	jcase	notwist	i dont know what ip i would be connectio nfrom
2009-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	notwist	jcase	having an ssh server open towards the internet can be a bad thing
2009-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	jcase		i know its not real security, but i have it on a random high number port, should keep most scanners away
2009-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	notwist	jcase	well you could have the ssh firewall enabled most of the time and just disable it when you travel then
2009-02-20T03:36:00.000Z	notwist	jcase	thats something :)
