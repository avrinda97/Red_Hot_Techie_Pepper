2009-01-30T03:59:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	you may have to enable it in your bios
2009-01-30T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	scaling is a bios supported function
2009-01-30T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	the bios has to support it too, not just the cpu
2009-01-30T04:02:00.000Z	RbK`	ikonia	and see how you can bios support? Sorry, but there are beginner
2009-01-30T04:03:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	reboot your PC and you'll see a key sequence to enter the bios
2009-01-30T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	fsb doesn't matter
2009-01-30T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	thats just a warning
2009-01-30T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	your bios may not support scaling as I said earlier
2009-01-30T04:24:00.000Z	RbK`	ikonia	and how to enable
2009-01-30T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	look in your bios
2009-01-30T04:25:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	check your cpu/board support it
2009-01-30T04:26:00.000Z	RbK`	ikonia	a site to check cpu / board support it
2009-01-30T04:26:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	the makers/manufactures site, or the manual that came with it
2009-01-30T04:27:00.000Z	RbK`	ikonia	and you have to watch it?
2009-01-30T04:27:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	no, just read the manual/docs to see a.) if it's supported b.) how to enable it
2009-01-30T04:27:00.000Z	ikonia	RbK`	not having cpu scaling enabled will not cause you any problems with linux
