2005-05-14T13:13:00.000Z	concept10		gosh, ubuntu is taking forever to install on my spare celeron 333mhz box
2005-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	concept10		how do i ssh into my ubuntu box? ssh -l user@xxx.xxx.xx.xx ??
2005-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	no, ssh -l user xxx.xxx.xxx.xx
2005-06-22T07:11:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	Applications | Internet | Terminal Server Client
2005-06-22T07:11:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	and I typed that as quickly as I could
2005-06-22T07:13:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	yes, RDP is the Microsoft protocol
2005-06-22T07:15:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	System | Preferences | Remote Desktop on the machine you want to log in to
2005-06-22T07:15:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	I have that setup already. I need to know what to do from my side
2005-06-22T07:16:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	it tells you command in that dialog box
2005-07-21T08:12:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	I understand that.  I just learned that optical mice jump on repeated patterns. Like the faux woodgrain on my desk
2005-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	one of the women in work still doesn't believe me, she thinks it was a setup, that I programmed her computer to make the mouse jump
2005-07-21T08:13:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	tell her to have a drink and shutup
2005-07-21T08:14:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	Tell her you programmed her mouse to click into her bank account when she is not there
2005-07-21T08:15:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	nah, that would be dangerous, she gets any problems with her bank account I guarantee she'd have the police knocking on my door
2005-07-21T08:15:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	j/k :)
2005-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	concept10	anto9us	you work on *nix boxes at work or windows?
2005-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	both
2005-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	anto9us	concept10	I'm trying to irradicate our dependence on M$
