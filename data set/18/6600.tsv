2010-07-15T09:29:00.000Z	VanessaE		did anyone see my question?  (from my end, it looks like it may have gotten buried)
2010-07-15T09:29:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	just repeat it
2010-07-15T09:32:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	check music player daemon or the remote functionality of pulseaudio in client.conf
2010-07-15T09:33:00.000Z	VanessaE	violinappren	I don't understand any of this pulseaudio stuff at all
2010-07-15T09:34:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	 mpd is easier to setup
2010-07-15T09:37:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	 I use pulseaudio for this and it's rather simple. You use paprefs to enable networking functionality in the machine with speakers, copy ~/.pulse-cookie from the remote machine to the local one, edit client.conf in the local machine and set the server-name to the remote machine
2010-07-15T09:39:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	^
2010-07-15T09:40:00.000Z	VanessaE	violinappren	ok, and when this is done I basically have two machines playing the same audio?
2010-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	you'll have the local machine (say a laptop) forwarding all it's audio to the remote machine (with intended speakers) merged with its own audio
2010-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	VanessaE	violinappren	ah..  that's not what I wanted to do. :)
2010-07-15T09:45:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	i think this can be achieved using a combination of pacat/parecord and ssh tunneling

2010-07-15T10:09:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	check the forum link
2010-07-15T10:10:00.000Z	VanessaE	violinappren	I'm using that link now, and it isn't working for me
2010-07-15T11:05:00.000Z	VanessaE	violinappren	well it would seem that the version of pulseaudio that comes with Lucid is broken - the "combine" module crashes pulse :-/
2010-07-15T11:08:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	hmm you could compile one.. but I remember before using pulseaudio i achieved something like that using merely alsa (to record sound and pipe it on ssh to aplay) but the sound quality was bad
2010-07-15T11:16:00.000Z	violinappren	VanessaE	http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2009/02/recording-application-sound-ou.html   but instead of a file name you could use - (stdout) and piple over ssh to aplay
