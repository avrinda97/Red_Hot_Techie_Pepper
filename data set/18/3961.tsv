2009-06-29T01:40:00.000Z	sademac		hi folks..  anyone know where I can find an iso for ubuntu 7.04 (preferrable the alternate ppc install iso, but I'm willing to give the desktop cd a try too)
2009-06-29T01:41:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	Try 8.04 ppc

2009-06-29T01:44:00.000Z	sademac	mdg	8.04 will run fine, as far as I know.. the problem is with the open ati driver version 6.8

2009-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	make sure you change your repos to the mac ones
2009-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	before you start downloading updates
2009-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	sademac	mdg	thanks, good to know
2009-06-29T01:49:00.000Z	sademac	mdg	are they not already setup that way off of a ppc iso?
2009-06-29T01:50:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	I had to change mine

2009-06-29T01:57:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	there's also a problem on install with the CD-rom - you have to modprobe in the install to get the CD working - its easy though
2009-06-29T02:09:00.000Z	mdg	sademac	you get my last two posts?
