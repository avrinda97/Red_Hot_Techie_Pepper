2005-03-25T12:53:00.000Z	ompaul	occy	have a look in alsamixer at the volumes for various inputs and outputs - that should help
2005-03-25T12:53:00.000Z	occy	ompaul	yah...
2005-03-25T12:55:00.000Z	ompaul	occy	I would be more interested in stuff that was muted, but that is just me

2005-03-25T12:57:00.000Z	ompaul	occy	other stuff can be to check for turned up to zero :)

2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z	ompaul	occy	well it is in the unstable version of the o/s being built, if you can afford the machine dying then you can consider running it but the o/s may not run, that is why it is the development version, stable came out in Oct it stays the same gets security fixes,
2005-12-07T14:41:00.000Z	occy	ompaul	I thought Firefox 1.5 was a stable release.
