2010-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		the bottom right is the power button
2010-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		Oh, it's near "Gnome"
2010-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		and disappears
2010-04-17T09:03:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		Nothing else happens
2010-04-17T09:04:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		it's labelled "onboard" from what I can see before it disappears
2010-04-17T09:04:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		otherwise, it's empty
2010-04-17T09:04:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		it's Lucid, yes
2010-04-17T09:04:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		blagh
2010-04-17T09:05:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		meh.  I'd rather not use such an ancient distro...
2010-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		yes, hence rather ancient
2010-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Dark_Shikari	#ubuntu+1 for lucid
2010-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		lol
2010-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari	d33d	I like to have software that isn't 2 years old
2010-04-17T09:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Dark_Shikari	this is not the correct channel for lucid
2010-04-17T09:07:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari	d33d	yeah, but being a developer of a program in ubuntu, it takes another 6 months to get the program in the first place
2010-04-17T09:07:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		and when they pick the version to include, it's already 6 months old
2010-04-17T09:08:00.000Z	Dark_Shikari		6 months + 6 months + 6 months and you're already nearing 2 years
2010-04-17T09:08:00.000Z	bazhang	Dark_Shikari	chat in #ubuntu-offtopic  lucid support in #ubuntu+1
