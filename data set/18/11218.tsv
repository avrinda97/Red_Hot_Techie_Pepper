2007-05-27T16:31:00.000Z	crabgrass		is there any way i can pass a command i want to run in terminal to xterm, so that it both starts the terminal (and keeps it open) and executes the command?
2007-05-27T16:31:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	gnome-terminal -e <command> ?
2007-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	with or without <>'s?
2007-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	command is the command you would like to execute. Without the <>
2007-05-27T16:33:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	I may have misunderstood your question, tho.
2007-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	no, that's it... except i can't get the xterm window to stay open
2007-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	you typed that command in an xterm window?
2007-05-27T16:34:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	and then you want to continue to use the xterm?
2007-05-27T16:35:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	i'm trying to make a shortcut on my desktop that will open terminal then run a terminal command in that window, keeping that window open so i can check on it's status
2007-05-27T16:36:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	what kind of a command? gnome-terminal -e <command> should open a new terminal executing <command> . except if the command ends with a return code of true/false.
2007-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	did you do it?
2007-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	xterm -e "synergys -f --config ~/synergy.conf && read"      did the trick
2007-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	I see.
2007-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	that was my command all along, i was just using hostname as a placeholder
2007-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	not your personal fight club =D
2007-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	he obviously whoised me
2007-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	crabgrass	habeeb	ooo.
2007-05-27T05:16:00.000Z	habeeb	crabgrass	rofl there was such an action
