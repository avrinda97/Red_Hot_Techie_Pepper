2011-08-07T22:36:00.000Z	azrad		i noob here, ubuntu 11.04; i'm having an issue where options on the frames of windows do not appear until they are maximized
2011-08-07T22:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	have you modified compiz
2011-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	so if I understand you the windows are not showing the top panel with the buttons unless you maximize tem?
2011-08-07T22:38:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	yeah, like thinks l ike "view" "options" stuff like that
2011-08-07T22:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	have you installed the compiz config settings manager and changed anything?
2011-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	i don't think so, i'm kind of a noob, i download this image, installed it, then did the software update, and installed a video driver, that is it
2011-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	oh and i installed xchat :)
2011-08-07T22:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	try in the terminal compiz --replace and see if that fixes it.
2011-08-07T22:56:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	i ran the command "compiz --replace" you suggested in the terminal, its been running for about 5 mins... its that normal?
2011-08-07T22:58:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	hmmm not sure, i don't see anything different, the "menus" are still missing (unless their window is maximized)
2011-08-07T22:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	menus?
2011-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	sure i'll take a screenshot
2011-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	here is a imagebin link if you need one. http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-08-07T23:12:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	http://imagebin.org/166836
2011-08-07T23:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	I see what you mean I have the same problem at times, but I have tweaked compiz to have the cube, there is also metacity --replace to use that desktop renderer.
2011-08-07T23:20:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	 ok now i'm really in trouble, my gui seems to be jack up... is there a keyboard short cut to spawn a terminal?
2011-08-07T23:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	azrad	crtl-alt-f2will take you to a tty, just rebooting or logging out would, get you back the desktop.
2011-08-07T23:22:00.000Z	azrad	urlin2u	ok doing that thanks
