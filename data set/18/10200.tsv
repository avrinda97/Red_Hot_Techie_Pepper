2007-04-21T05:51:00.000Z	variant	jasin	I sugested you open a bug report. I didn't blame anything
2007-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	jasin	variant	its not a bug its some sorta configuration problem, but anyways, I already did submit the problem to ubuntu.
2007-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	variant	jasin	that is what a bug is, why did you say i was "blaming your system"?

2007-04-21T05:55:00.000Z	variant	jasin	so the bug is with the program that incorrectly configured that file. == bug
2007-04-21T05:55:00.000Z	variant	jasin	EOF
2007-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	jasin	variant	i'm sorry but you just do not know what you are talking about, configuration files are not programs, software.
2007-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	variant	jasin	ok mate, you are right. well done
2007-04-21T05:57:00.000Z	jasin	variant	Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made by people in either a program's source code or its design, and a few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code.
