2007-08-05T09:33:00.000Z	fraser		guys, i always get the same errro when trying to use mplayer to play a video "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device." why?
2007-08-05T09:34:00.000Z	Pelo	fraser	 open mplayer from the menu,   ricgclick on it ,  preferences,  video , select a different videomodule,   x11 opengl works best for me
2007-08-05T09:34:00.000Z	fraser	Pelo	thanks. it's working fine now
2007-08-05T09:35:00.000Z	Pelo	fraser	 there is a similar problem with the audio if you get it ,  same solution , more or less
