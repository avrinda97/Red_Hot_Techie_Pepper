2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	puff	bofh80	Yes.
2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	bofh80	puff	have you got a carpet?
2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	puff	bofh80	 I have my old ubuntu drive in a USB caddy. It mounted last week and I backed up my old data.  Now I need to  sanitize the drive and send it back (it was replaced under warranty) and it won't mount so I can't overwrite it.
2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	puff	bofh80	It just mounted under winxp, tho.  Hm.
2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	puff	bofh80	A carpet??
2008-08-28T09:42:00.000Z	bofh80	puff	throw the drive in the air and let it hit your carpet
2008-08-28T09:44:00.000Z	bofh80	puff	if the drive is being replaced as faulty, rubber mallet is good industry, otherwise, air and carpet work well, as it leaves no physical marks
2008-08-28T09:46:00.000Z	bofh80	puff	doo IT man, don't they expect a f**ked drive in the post anyway?
2008-08-28T09:48:00.000Z	puff	bofh80	Well,I'll go have some drinks and see if it seems like a good idea when I get home :-).
