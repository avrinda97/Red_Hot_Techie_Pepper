2006-06-23T14:04:00.000Z	DarthVader		howdy
2006-06-23T14:05:00.000Z	DarthVader		is there some kind of filtering on ubuntu (or Linux in general) that will make a packet broadcasted from another computer not received by a socket expecting it (correct UDP port and SO_BROADCAST set)?
2006-06-23T14:06:00.000Z	DarthVader		more specificaly, when the IP @ and subnet mask of the packet sender doesn't match the Linux host settings?
2006-06-23T14:07:00.000Z	DarthVader		I can see the packet with ethereal, but the socket doesn't get it ...
2006-06-23T14:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DarthVader	sounds like you are trying to hack a Linux box to me..
2006-06-23T14:09:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	no I'm trying to talk to a ethernet device that is mis-configured
2006-06-23T14:11:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	I'll assume that Linux think this is an "illegal" packet .. is there a way to turn this off?
2006-06-23T14:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DarthVader	DO you have physical access to that box
2006-06-23T14:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DarthVader	I am not entirely sure what all you are trying to do
2006-06-23T14:14:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	I'm working with a device that can have its IP configuration changed ... if it is plugged on a computer with the wrong IP settings ... the device can be contacted using broadcasting to reconfigured ...
2006-06-23T14:15:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	so I'm sending a broadcast on the network (LAN) and that device is answering to it ... but Linux filter-out its answer
2006-06-23T14:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	DarthVader	what firewall are you using, are you also behind a router?
2006-06-23T14:17:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not using a firewall on that Linux box AFAIK .... but it's the default ubuntu install ... so maybe there is one running?
2006-06-23T14:19:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	also that device is directly connected to the Linux box adapter
2006-06-23T14:26:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	iptables doesn't report any rules been set
2006-06-23T14:27:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	np
2006-06-23T14:36:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	so any suggestion(s)?
2006-06-23T14:37:00.000Z	DarthVader	Jack_Sparrow	ok, thanks anyway
