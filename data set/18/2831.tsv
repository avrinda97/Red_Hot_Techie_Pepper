2010-02-10T23:21:00.000Z	SirLoseALot		Hey guys I'm looking for a way to change the Artist in the id3 tag of multiple mp3s at once. Tried Easytag 2.1.6 but it seems it only allows editing one file at a time. Anyone know a tool?
2010-02-10T23:21:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	I use mp3tag (a Windows program) under WINE
2010-02-10T23:21:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	There are ways to script it
2010-02-10T23:21:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	I'm no good at scripting - I use Ubuntu since yesterday :)
2010-02-10T23:22:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	Is mp3tag easy to install under wine?
2010-02-10T23:22:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	Yes, wine setup.exe ;)
2010-02-10T23:22:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	You might find that works well for you
2010-02-10T23:22:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	I tried the same with teamviewer. It installs successfully but aferwards can't be started and isn't in wine's c:/programs/ oO
2010-02-10T23:23:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	Any idea what might be going on?
2010-02-10T23:23:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	Some programs simply don't work.  I have never used that one, sorry
2010-02-10T23:24:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	actually, it does work, even without installation. I am just confused about it installing correctly but then not showing in c:. Anyways, I'll try mp3 tag now, hopefully you're still here if something goes wrong :(
2010-02-10T23:26:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	It says there's an update available. Can I simply download & install it from within the program?
2010-02-10T23:27:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	I've never tried that, it might work!
2010-02-10T23:27:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	But equally it might not.
2010-02-10T23:27:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	Well, I feel adventurous :p
2010-02-10T23:27:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	It probably wont break it ;)
2010-02-10T23:32:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	edeca	mp3tag works great, does exactly what I wanted - Thanks a lot :)
2010-02-10T23:33:00.000Z	edeca	SirLoseALot	It is an awesome program
