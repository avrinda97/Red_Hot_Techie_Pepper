2011-11-23T16:50:00.000Z	bgtr34		hello, new user here i've installed ydl before and ubuntu on ps3. just about to install on laptop through wubi. how do I get ubuntu to recognise my wireless card so i can connect to internetz
2011-11-23T16:51:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	what kind of card?
2011-11-23T16:52:00.000Z	bgtr34	geoffmcc	i'm not sure it is whatever is in dell 1520 as it came. i think a broadcom but I havent owned a pc in a few years im a little out of touch!
2011-11-23T16:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	yea, if it dell most likley broadcom. you just need to go to software center and install the firmware-b43-install package, but you will need to have a wired connection to do it
2011-11-23T16:56:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	to be honest i never really gave it much of a chance, i tried it a while back, didnt like something about it but i dont even remember what that was
2011-11-23T16:56:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	do you have a flash drive you can use?
2011-11-23T16:57:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	i just never really gave it much of a chance, i remember installing it and then just kinda deleted it and partitioned and used iso to install
2011-11-23T17:02:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	yea, wubi is designed for window users to try ubuntu without fear of dataloss
2011-11-23T17:03:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	with wubi ubuntu is installed on c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk. it does not get installed to its own partition
2011-11-23T17:07:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	exactly, its meant for you to try it before you commit to it
2011-11-23T17:08:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	if your looking to dual boot though, its always easier to do if you setup windows first, create a partition for ubuntu and then use the installer to do the rest, it will notice your windows and give you a install along side option
2011-11-23T17:10:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	winxp?
2011-11-23T17:11:00.000Z	bgtr34	geoffmcc	im on vista.
2011-11-23T17:12:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	i believe it is in administrative tools/computer managment/disk managment/ then you right click on the partitoon and choose shrink and select a size
2011-11-23T17:14:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	no problem
2011-11-23T17:27:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	yea i always have a little unused space at the end, not a lot
2011-11-23T17:29:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	i couldnt say as i really dont know what it is
2011-11-23T17:31:00.000Z	geoffmcc	bgtr34	i always right click on c and choose shrink and then set to size. This also may be handled buy the install disk too, but i always setup partition on my own first
