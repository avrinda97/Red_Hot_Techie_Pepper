2007-05-03T13:43:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	try setting the progs to use gksudo
2007-05-03T13:45:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	I'm stumped .. neither gksu nor gksudo works ... the app asks for my password but then freezes ... all is see is a blank white window pop up but no data within it ... very strange
2007-05-03T13:45:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	if you use sudo -i in a term youll get a root shell
2007-05-03T13:45:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	wihtout having to set a root password
2007-05-03T13:46:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	will that help me with something?
2007-05-03T13:46:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	you could run the whole prog from root if its just this one time
2007-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	you may need to update DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY though for X progs to work from within sudo -i
2007-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	how do i do that?
2007-05-03T13:47:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	do echo $DISPLAY $XAUTHORITY in a normal term
2007-05-03T13:48:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	then export DISPLAY=... and export XAUTHORIZTY=.... in the sudo -i  term
2007-05-03T13:49:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	i'm sorry but what will this allow me to do in the end that will address my problem opening admin apps?? sorry i don't get it
2007-05-03T13:49:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	yuou can start the prog within the root shell
2007-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	and it will be in root from the start and wont need gksu
2007-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	but when i try to use gksu it won't work so why would the root shell be any different?
2007-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	if your allready root it wont need a password
2007-05-03T13:52:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	i think we are trying to address different issues ... i want to bring my system back to its working state in which I could click on an admin app in System/Admin and use it normally ... that's all
2007-05-03T13:52:00.000Z	clever	seamus7	ahhh :S
2007-05-03T13:53:00.000Z	seamus7	clever	i wasn't very clear sorry
