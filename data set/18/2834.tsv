2010-09-06T14:27:00.000Z	Error404NotFound		http://pastebin.com/AhZbfvDK is this a valid bind zone definition? specially the MX part? Upon "dig mx domain.com" it gives "domain.com. 14400 IN MX 10 213.15.90.208.domain.com." which i don't think is right
2010-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	ask in #dbs
2010-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	ask in #dns
2010-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	tried in #bind with no luck
2010-09-06T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	ok - it's still nothing to do with ubuntu
2010-09-06T14:30:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	may be if dns is hosted on an ubuntu box :P
2010-09-06T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	no
2010-09-06T14:31:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	i was just kidding, peace :)
2011-10-03T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	cron.d is the global control, individual crontabs are in /var/spool/cron
2011-10-03T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	edit with crontab -e
2011-10-03T19:21:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	say i have file1.crons and file2.crons under a user abc, i want to keep both separate(as scripts update those files on regular basis), both follow the cron syntax. I can only create one file per user, what would be an alternate?
2011-10-03T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	I would suggest looking at an include in your users crontab
2011-10-03T19:22:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	any hints, what keywords should i put on google? 'include user crontab' ?
2011-10-03T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	the format is normally something like inclued /home/user/cron1.crontab
2011-10-03T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	I'm not sure if you can do this in user crontabs, but I believe so, so give it a try
2011-10-03T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	check the cron docs to see if you can include
2011-10-03T19:23:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ikonia	include /path/to/cron.file, where exactly? cron config?
2011-10-03T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Error404NotFound	in the individual users crontab, I don't know if you can do that, it's worth checking
