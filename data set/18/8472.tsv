2008-04-28T21:23:00.000Z	DrHalan		hey guys ive a prob recently my ubuntu machine doesnt detect my usb wlan adapter anymore though it used to
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	DrHalan		power use skyp e or ekiga
2008-04-28T21:27:00.000Z	DrHalan		guys, is it the same with linux that when i use a 64bit version hardware support is worse?
2008-04-28T21:28:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	Hardware support should be the same on 64-bit as on 32-bit, in general
2008-04-28T21:28:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	There may be a few exceptions, but I don't know of any
2008-04-28T21:28:00.000Z	DrHalan	Wyzard	i never used a 64bit linux but everybody knows thats the fact on a windows platform
2008-04-28T21:29:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	That's because Windows depends on drivers written by the hardware manufacturers, and many of them haven't made 64-bit drivers for all their older products
2008-04-28T21:30:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	Linux drivers are open-source and have pretty much all been ported to 64-bit by the Linux developers
2008-04-28T21:30:00.000Z	DrHalan	Wyzard	ok. what about binary drivers like nvidia or flgrx
2008-04-28T21:30:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	nVidia's driver has a 64-bit version that works fine (I'm using it right now) and I'm pretty sure ATI does too
2008-04-28T21:32:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	alexbe01 is correct in pointing out that there's no 64-bit Flash or Java browser plugins -- that's the only really noteworthy 64-bit limitation I'm aware of
2008-04-28T21:32:00.000Z	DrHalan	Wyzard	what issue?
2008-04-28T21:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	The Adobe Flash and Sun Java browser plugins are not available in 64-bit versions
2008-04-28T21:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	on any OS (not just Linux)
2008-04-28T21:34:00.000Z	DrHalan	Wyzard	are you guys seriosu? i cant use it then..
2008-04-28T21:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	so you can't use Flash or Java applets on 64-bit Linux unless you use one of the free alternatives (like gnash for Flash, which doesn't work very well)
2008-04-28T21:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	DrHalan	There's a workaround for Flash involving something called nspluginwrapper to load the 32-bit Flash plugin, but I've had mixed success with it in Debian (never tried it in Ubuntu)
2008-04-28T21:35:00.000Z	DrHalan	Wyzard	 there are not much reasons for me to go for 64 bit so i just forget abou that
