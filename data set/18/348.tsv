2012-04-02T00:51:00.000Z	tallboy_2		Noob here.  I just switched from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04.  My Intel integrated graphics card does not support Unity so it defaulted to Classic Gnome.  I need the "zoom desktop" feature to work as I am legally blind.  This worked in 10.10, but cannot get it to work in 11.04.  Any suggestions to get it working again? Thanks in advance.
2012-04-02T00:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	is that "zoom desktop" a compiz feature?  if so, you might have an issue...
2012-04-02T00:53:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 Yes it was :(
2012-04-02T00:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	then unity3d's failure to run indicates a compiz failure to run.
2012-04-14T08:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	does dmesg register anything (says if the kernel sees something)
2012-04-14T08:59:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 uhh is there any way to narrow down what I'm look for with "dmesg"?  What am I looking for?
2012-04-14T09:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	unplug the device, wait - type "dmesg" -- plug device in, wait -- type "dmesg" (is there any change?)
2012-04-14T09:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	something like "dmesg | tail -n 15" might help also
2012-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 Yes, the last command was easier to notice if kernel noticed the phone, and it does when I plug it in.
2012-04-14T09:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	does it get an sdX assigned to it?
2012-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	that would have been mentioned in teh dmesg output
2012-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 This is the line it shows  [ 2541.788043] usb 1-6: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 7
2012-04-14T09:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	after that anything?
2012-04-14T09:08:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 That is what it shows after I use the second command.  dmesg | tail -n 15
2012-04-14T09:09:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 I use my phone sometimes to tether my internet connection using "easytether" and it works.  It just won't recognize it as a drive
2012-04-14T09:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	it doesn't seem the kernel sees it as a "drive" :(  what ubuntu version are you using again?
2012-04-14T09:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	tallboy_2	sorry, i'm sorta outta "real" suggestions...  good luck
2012-04-14T09:12:00.000Z	tallboy_2	zykotick9	 Hey, thanks for the help.  Any other place you could direct me for help?
