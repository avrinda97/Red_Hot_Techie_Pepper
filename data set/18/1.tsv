2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		this is a misconception
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		new stuff != faster
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		at all
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		it never was and never will
2004-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	fabbione		if it is faster you are lucky
2004-12-05T15:00:00.000Z	fabbione		it is strictly subjective point of view
2004-12-05T15:02:00.000Z	fabbione		and no.. glxgear is NOT a benchmark
2004-12-05T15:03:00.000Z	fabbione		that is not a benchmark :-)
2004-12-05T15:03:00.000Z	king_arthur	fabbione	just any window in nautilus
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	fabbione	king_arthur	still...
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	fabbione		it can be nautilus that is slow
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	fabbione		not "hoary"
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	king_arthur	fabbione	I agree
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	fabbione		or perhaps one of the nautilus libs
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	king_arthur	fabbione	but the final result is a lot worse than warty
2004-12-05T15:04:00.000Z	king_arthur	fabbione	BTW what's gamin?
2004-12-05T15:05:00.000Z	king_arthur	fabbione	 what's fam ? 8)
