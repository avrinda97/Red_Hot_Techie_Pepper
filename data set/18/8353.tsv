2007-12-19T15:26:00.000Z	staykovmarin		hi i would like to ask, how is it possible that a drive gets formatted when you tell the partitioner to resize?
2007-12-19T15:26:00.000Z	staykovmarin		orly?
2007-12-19T15:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	It shouldn't get "reformatted" if you just tell it to resize, it will however re-write the partition table, but that is not reformatting
2007-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Yikes, you might try "testdisk", but if the partition really was formatted over then most if not all your data is gone :(
2007-12-19T15:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Firstly, what makes you think that your windows partition is gone?
2007-12-19T15:32:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Jordan_U	the windows one is there, its the fat32 that i used to backup all my files that is gone
2007-12-19T15:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	What makes you think that it is gone?
2007-12-19T15:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Still here?
2007-12-19T15:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Testdisk is available through synaptic/ apt on Ubuntu BTW, in case you don't know how to install software yet.
2007-12-19T15:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l" ?
2007-12-19T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	If you install testdisk from the liveCD you will need to enable the universe repository first
2007-12-19T15:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	testdisk is available for both, but 7.10 will have a newer version
2007-12-19T15:40:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Jordan_U	i cant get online with that machine. can i install it using a different source?
2007-12-19T15:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Yes, you can download the .deb before hand and put it on a USB drive or something
2007-12-19T15:42:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Jordan_U	can i somehow get it off the 7.10 cd? i dont have a pen drive
2007-12-19T15:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	Testdisk does not come on the Ubuntu LiveCD, you will need to download it separately or connect to the internet from  the LiveCD ( or use a data recovery distribution that has it installed on the CD itself ).
2007-12-19T15:44:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Jordan_U	can i somehow use the 7.10 applications cd? i though i can use that as a repo?
2007-12-19T15:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	staykovmarin	It is only a repository for the default applications, and the DVD only contains the main repository, testdisk is in universe ( I think it would take at least 6 DVD's full of compressed packages to hold all of the packages in universe )
