2011-12-19T19:32:00.000Z	fidel		how can i prevent the unity launcher from hiding ?
2011-12-19T19:33:00.000Z	fidel		i expected it should work via compizconfig
2011-12-19T19:33:00.000Z	fidel		compizConfig Settings Manager
2011-12-19T19:35:00.000Z	fidel		but it doenst seem to work
2011-12-19T19:35:00.000Z	fidel		that **** launcher/dock still autohides
2011-12-19T19:35:00.000Z	fidel		hide launcher: never is supposed to be the correct setting right?
2011-12-19T19:37:00.000Z	fidel		it still hides
2011-12-19T19:37:00.000Z	fidel		do i need to relogin to make that setting active? i doubt that
2011-12-19T19:37:00.000Z	fidel		i did already
2011-12-19T19:38:00.000Z	deej1976	fidel	Sorry I don't know
2011-12-19T19:38:00.000Z	fidel		k- thanks anyway
2011-12-19T19:39:00.000Z	fidel		seems like i have to move to xfce/gnome-shell or something different then
2011-12-19T19:39:00.000Z	fidel		thanks once again
2011-12-19T19:45:00.000Z	fidel	deej1976	the problem i didnt realize in the first place - it was unity-2d
2011-12-19T19:45:00.000Z	fidel		and in that case the ccsm settings dont work
2011-12-19T19:45:00.000Z	fidel		it works via dconf
2011-12-19T19:46:00.000Z	deej1976	fidel	Thanks for the information
