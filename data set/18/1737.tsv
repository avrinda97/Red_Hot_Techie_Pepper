2011-01-17T00:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	have you tried NOT dragging and dropping
2011-01-17T00:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	winscp will tell you if it is an issue with permissions
2011-01-17T00:43:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	how do i do that sorry I'm new to scp and winscp
2011-01-17T00:43:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	i don't know. but you should be able to right click and then choose download or sth.
2011-01-17T00:47:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	 i tried right clicking no options for download but I tried Copy I got the same response saying waiting for host. I tried "Edit" and it brought up the same prompt.  just to make sure it was workign I could drag and drop a file from my windows 7 machien to ubuntu but not the other way round
2011-01-17T00:49:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	strange have you tried with filezilla?
2011-01-17T00:49:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	may be a probl. with winscp
2011-01-17T00:50:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	I tried filezilla at first before using scp. Same thing I can upload files from win 7 to ubuntu but not download
2011-01-17T00:50:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	i'm just going to enable winscp loggin and see if anything comes up
2011-01-17T00:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	are you sure you have the permission to read the files with the account you log in. (it should tell you if you don't but you never know)
2011-01-17T00:57:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	how can i check whether my user has the right permissions. still getting my head around ubuntu
2011-01-17T00:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	on your ubuntu box. with nautilus for example
2011-01-17T00:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	right click on the file -> properties
2011-01-17T01:01:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	ok I got access control list tab
2011-01-17T01:03:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	then it  seems you have the permissions to read
2011-01-17T01:04:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	perhaps its win7 thats blocking it.
2011-01-17T01:06:00.000Z	sam-_-	alaing	possible. do you have write permissions on your winbox were you want to save the file?
2011-01-17T01:06:00.000Z	alaing	sam-_-	i'm the only user so i'm assuming i do
