2012-02-01T00:14:00.000Z	guest4375430		Hi guys ! I am facing an unusual problem with Ubuntu 11.10 with respect to establishing mobile broadband connection ! I am unable to connect to internet using mobile broadband connection after installing it on hard disk, but when I run through live cd, it connects.... any pointers will be appreciated... thanx !
2012-02-01T00:16:00.000Z	guest4375430		anyone can help with mobile broadband usb device based connection ????
2012-02-01T00:18:00.000Z	guest4375430		there are lot of usb devices listed .... I am not sure which one it is... and where would I find the guide ?
2012-02-01T00:18:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	I installed, checking the propriatary option and got the wifi drivers I needed when I installed.
2012-02-01T00:20:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	that didnt work for me ? I was even connected to internet when I ran ubuntu from live cd, and then I selected "Install ubuntu" option on hard disk....
2012-02-01T00:20:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	it is back to square one and when I ran lsusb, it doesnt list my mobile usb modem :\
2012-02-01T00:22:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	try lsusb when running the live cd and find what you need, I guess
2012-02-01T00:23:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	I did and it gives me many option though I have short listed two usb devices which are likely to be my  usb modem,
2012-02-01T00:23:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	or lsudo shw
2012-02-01T00:24:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	well, disconect the modem and boot the live cd again and compare
2012-02-01T00:25:00.000Z	guest4375430		well , got it
2012-02-01T00:25:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	what should I do next
2012-02-01T00:26:00.000Z	guest4375430		I have been able to zero in ... the 8 digit hex code for device but the product name is wrong
2012-02-01T00:27:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	well, disconect the modem and boot the live cd again and compare
2012-02-01T00:27:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	ok what next .... I have 8 digit hex code for my usb modem device .... ?
2012-02-01T00:30:00.000Z	w30	guest4375430	you need a name for your device so you can look in your synaptic for such a device application. lsusb, lshw or something in proc should give you a hint
2012-02-01T00:33:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	this is the device " Bus 006 Device 003: ID 19d2:fff1 ONDA Communication S.p.A."
2012-02-01T00:33:00.000Z	guest4375430	w30	however that is not right because the correct name for device is zte cdma modem
