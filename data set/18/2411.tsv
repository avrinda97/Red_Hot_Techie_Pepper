2010-05-22T01:40:00.000Z	nathanhelp		What's a good emailer (safe) for ubuntu?
2010-05-22T01:41:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Depends...
2010-05-22T01:42:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	On what? probably a better answer will come from stating what I want to happen. I have windows 7 on my other computer. Someone suggested pegasus mail for windows on that computer. What's an equivalent for ubuntu (This machine)?
2010-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Why are you shouting...we can hear you ; loud and clear!
2010-05-22T01:44:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	How am I shouting?
2010-05-22T01:45:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Why don't you take a peek in Ubuntu Software Centre (Don't wait for opinion)
2010-05-22T01:47:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	How was I shouting? I don't know irc chat protocol.
2010-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	I don't understand. I wasn't shouting. Was I?
2010-05-22T01:54:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Postfix
2010-05-22T01:57:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	I'm looking at postfix's website, (I'm an ex thunderbird user, semi-ex windows user), How is this "secure"? As a matter of fact, is Ubuntu secure from intrusion, behind my firewall?
2010-05-22T02:00:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Guarantees NONE!!
2010-05-22T02:02:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	I'm not a programmer. I just want a safe to use, simple to use, email client that can't be hijacked by incoming email. Can you reccommend anything? I don't understand Postfix - as fact, i dont understand much of what I'm given here. I know there's no guarantee's. I'm looking for 80% probablilty of it working well, being secure, and simple to use.
2010-05-22T02:06:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: As you are familiar with Thunderbird ; try it.
2010-05-22T02:07:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	Am I asking questions about security of email client, that really apply to the OS instead?
2010-05-22T02:08:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	As in, I used thunderbird on win7. IT got hijacked. Is that likely to happen on thunderbird Ubuntu?
2010-05-22T02:10:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: Even Ubuntu (out of the box) Firewall is not configured..according our convince ; we have to configure it..(encrypt the mail while you send it ) no matter what client you use.
2010-05-22T02:10:00.000Z	nathanhelp	U571	I'm behind a physical router/firewall.
2010-05-22T02:14:00.000Z	U571	nathanhelp	: so are thinking isp is peeking on your mail???
